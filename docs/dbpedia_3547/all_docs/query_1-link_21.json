After that I taught the course in the Franciscan School of Theology of the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. Subsequently, I would teach significant sections of the course as part of classes on Latin American history at the University of Montana and the University of Minnesota– Morris. I would like to thank the administrations of those fine institutions for providing me with the opportunity to develop the ideas of this book as I taught in those schools. It is the students, however, who played an even more important role as they struggled, along beside me, to better understand the broad sweep of the history of the Church in Latin America. I began my research in the history of the Church in my doctoral research, which focused on the secular, or diocesan, clergy in sixteenth-century Mexico. The essential text and basis for most modern research on the Church in the early colonial period is Robert Ricard’s The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico. Ricard focused primarily on the mendicant orders and made only passing references to the secular clergy. My study of the secular clergy also led me to look at the financial underpinnings of the colonial church, especially the importance of the tithe and of the creation and management of endowments to support individual clerics. Early in my career, friendships with Asunción Lavrin and Arnold Bauer were forged by our mutual interests in the investments of the Church. The Reverend Stafford Poole, C.M., has been a constant friend, mentor, and consultant on ecclesiastical topics. None of this could have happened without his aid. My interests soon expanded to look at both the religious orders and the diocesan clergy during the period. In particular because of my training in Nahuatl, the Aztec language, I was soon interested in the dynamics of conversion. I collected information about Nahuatl language manuscripts in the United States and studied their role and function in the larger effort at evangelization.\n\n| vii\n\nThe landmark book by James Lockhart, The Nahuas After the Conquest, provided my research with a solid theoretical basis on understanding the dynamics of culture change during the contact period. In looking at the Church in the later colonial period, William B. Taylor has recently written a monumental book, The Magistrates of the Sacred, which is essential reading if one is to understand the Church in the eighteenth century and into the beginning of the independence era. One cannot understand the intricacies of Church and state relations in the nineteenth and early twentieth century without a close reading of Lloyd Mecham’s Church and State in Latin America. The Reverend Jeffery Klaiber, SJ, became a friend during my residency in Peru and has remained so thereafter. His insightful studies on the history of the Church in Peru have inspired me and assisted me greatly as I have attempted to look at the whole of Latin America. For the most recent period, I was very fortunate to have been on the faculty at the Saint Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary when the seminary hosted a large conference on liberation theology. There are many individuals who have assisted me in this adventure, but I can mention only a few here. I especially want to express my deep thanks to Jennifer Hammer, my editor at New York University Press. This project has taken far longer than either of us anticipated at the outset. She has been a tremendous help to me in the several revisions through which the book has passed. I would also like to thank the anonymous readers both of the original prospectus and of the finished manuscript. Their comments have helped to make this a better work. I also want to thank my many colleagues at the University of Minnesota–Morris, and at SUNY Potsdam for having indulged me as an administrator to remain moderately active in research. I have tremendous admiration for my colleagues who are not only heavily involved with teaching and the formation of our students but who also pursue very active programs of creative activity. Needless to say, the contributions of all these wonderful people and works have assisted me in improving the book. Any errors are completely due to my own shortcomings. Through all of this my family has provided me with great support. My parents, Henry and Juliette Schwaller, brought me up in a loving home and encouraged me to pursue a life of the mind. As a child I remember the seemingly countless churches in Mexico that we visited every year during our annual trip south of the border. Little did I know then that I would dedicate a large part of my life to studying those very churches and the people who worshipped in them. My sons, Robert and William, indulge their father as he tries to balance family life, a career as an academic administrator, and a viii | Acknowledgments\n\nrole as a scholar. For this, I thank them. My wife, Anne, has been the best friend a person could ever hope to have. She has accompanied me through three continents as we have pursued elusive documentation. She is the best sounding board for ideas and a solid proofreader once those ideas get put in print. Her ministry has shown me how small groups and an atmosphere of love and support can transform lives. Words simply cannot begin to express my thanks to her.\n\nAcknowledgments | ix\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nPresenting the history of the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America is a mammoth undertaking. Few would doubt that Catholicism is the single most important institution in the region if for no other reason than it is perhaps the only one that has remained central to most peoples’ lives over a period of some five hundred years. Yet to try to tell the story of this institution on two continents involving millions of people and five centuries is an extremely difficult task. In order to begin to come to grips with it, one must look for the themes that run throughout the whole story while examining the individual pieces as they develop. First of all Latin America is a region poorly understood and difficult to define. The region of the Americas consists of two continents, North and South America, divided at Panama. In general, Latin America refers to those countries on the American continents that speak a language based in Latin. Using this rubric, then, a case might be made for Quebec to be considered a Latin American region: it is in North America and most of the inhabitants speak French. Nevertheless, in practical use, the region known as Latin America tends to be those areas settled by the Spanish and Portuguese, and not the French, although a case might be made for French Guiana, located on the northeast coast of South America. Yet, its history is quite different from that of its neighbors, such as Venezuela and Brazil, and so French Guiana is usually excluded. Consequently the term “Latin American” usually refers to those regions where Spanish or Portuguese predominate The other area of difficulty is the Caribbean. The largest islands (Hispaniola, Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico) were all first settled by the Spanish. Yet the smaller islands, known collectively as the Lesser Antilles, were not heavily exploited by the Spanish, and consequently in the eighteenth century other European powers claimed them, as the world’s demand for sugar increased and these islands were perfect for sugar cultivation. The Caribbean region has a very different history from the mainland. Cuba and half of Hispaniola, now the Dominican Republic, do have some similarities with main\n\n| 1\n\nland Spanish-speaking countries, but the similarities within the Caribbean far outweigh the similarities of underlying Hispanic culture, and so many scholars consider the Caribbean its own region for historical purposes. This book follows that typology and does not include the islands of the Caribbean as part of its principle focus. The next most important consideration is the periodization of Latin American history. In the most basic scheme Latin American history is divided into two periods: the colonial period, and the modern period. From 1492 until the early nineteenth century most of Latin America consisted of colonies of European powers, namely of Spain and Portugal. Between 1810 and 1824 most countries in Latin America achieved their independence from their colonial rulers and set out on their own path. Nevertheless, the more one focuses on the region and the changes that occurred over this large sweep of time, some additional nuances come to the fore. Most importantly the region had a long and vibrant history of human occupation well before the arrival of the Spanish and Portuguese. Many important civilizations rose and fell between the arrival of the first human on the continents, tens of thousands of years ago, until the late fifteenth century. Prior to the colonial period, then, one really must include a pre-Columbian era, that time before the arrival of the Europeans. Looking at the now three periods of Latin American History, additional distinctions come into focus. The first century or so after the arrival of the Europeans was an epoch of some warfare but certainly of rapid expansion by the Europeans and cultural change on the part of the natives of the region. As one enters the seventeenth century things change significantly. No longer are there many expeditions of discovery and conquest, but life settles down into a daily routine. The region seems to begin to focus internally on exploiting the resources at hand and at developing a unique style. As a result many scholars draw a distinction between the period of conquest and settlement, in the sixteenth century, with the more developmental seventeenth century. Looking at local economies, too, the seventeenth century was one more of steady production, as opposed to the rapid increase in economic development in the earlier period. Some scholars even say that it was a century of depression, since the economies seem to have almost stagnated after the rapid growth of the early period. In terms of the arts, however, the seventeenth century was one of tremendous energy and productivity. A new style emerged, called the Baroque. Architecturally, it was characterized by great exuberance, intricate and complex carvings on altars, church facades, and other sculpture. Paintings were filled with action and complexity. In literature wordplay and complex laby2 | Introduction\n\nrinthine plots were the hallmark. Musically, harmonic and rhythmic complexity and contrast, along with the solidification of musical forms defined the era. As we look more closely, we find that these developments were very different from the first century of European occupation of the Americas. Yet the eighteenth century was dramatically different from the previous two. A new ruling house came to govern Spain, the Bourbons. They brought with them a new style of government and new tastes in the arts. They implemented a whole series of reforms in the imperial system. In Portugal and her colonies the eighteenth century also saw change, not caused by a new ruling house but by international competition. Portugal also implemented sweeping reforms in her imperial system, and her principal colony, Brazil, became one of the wealthiest places on earth thanks to extremely rich mines, the spread of sugar agriculture, and the beginnings of coffee production. And so, again, looking more closely, the eighteenth century was dramatically different from the periods that had come before. The eighteenth-century reforms implemented in Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the Americas carried with them the seeds of their own destruction. The reforms created a large cadre of wealthy individuals who felt betrayed by the mother country. At the same time, new ideas began to filter into Latin America from Europe about liberty and equality. Without a triggering event, however, these ideas seemed destined to merely become topics for debate rather than battle cries. Nevertheless, in 1808 the French, under Napoleon Bonaparte, invaded Spain and Portugal, and provided a moment for critical decision in the colonies. With the imperial governments in Europe essentially held hostage by the French, the colonists needed to make some decisions about what constituted legitimate authority. It took several decades for this debate to work out, but eventually every country of Latin America would opt for independence by about 1824. Consequently, although at first glance the colonial period seems to be amorphous and uniform, upon closer scrutiny one can perceive three rather different eras, roughly corresponding to the three centuries. The modern, or national, period in Latin America corresponds to the period since independence. Just as with the colonial period, when one looks more closely unique sub-periods emerge. To begin with, the period of the struggles for independence actually stretched far beyond nominal autonomy, as warring factions within the newly independent countries had to work out their many differences. Within a decade or so, one faction gained the upper hand. For the next three or so decades, most Latin American nations saw low levels of political disruptions as the governing faction had to con\n\nIntroduction | 3\n\ntinually fight, either politically or on the battlefield, against opposition factions. Toward the later part of the nineteenth century the situation reversed. The faction in power lost control, the faction out of power gained it. Many reforms occurred, and political sparring continued. By the early twentieth century built-up tensions in some countries erupted in violence, civil war, and revolution, especially in Mexico. In other countries the changes of the early twentieth century occurred in the ballot box, but change did come. At about the time of the worldwide Depression of 1930, Latin America saw a wave of military governments take power. These lasted until immediately after the Second World War, when civilian governments briefly took over, only to be overthrown by a second wave of military takeovers. In the last two decades of the twentieth century nearly every country returned to civilian rule, with most countries experiencing sharp debates between major parties as to the best course for the future. Everything outlined above is a gross oversimplification of what actually occurred in Latin America, but it at least provides a roadmap for understanding the general contours of Latin American history, but the exceptions to this are just as important as the cases that prove it. While Mexico experienced a violent revolution in the early twentieth century, Chile had a more peaceful transition from the politics of the nineteenth century to the demands of the twentieth. On the other hand, most counties had military governments for many decades in the twentieth century, but Mexico and Costa Rica did not. Again, the exceptions are just as important as the rule. In considering the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America, there are a few special circumstances to keep in mind. Latin America was the first place in the world where peoples from four continents lived and worked side by side. As a result of the imperial systems of both the Spanish and the Portuguese, peoples from Europe, Africa, and Asia all met in the Americas. This created an extremely complex social system. Because of a long history of contact with Africa and with Muslims, the Spanish and Portuguese had developed a social system which took into account a person’s ethnic and cultural origins. Under the Spanish and the Portuguese individuals had to come from what the powers that be felt was a pure Christian heritage in order for them to gain important political or social positions. They also recognized the economic and social status of slaves, who were relegated to a different social status. Slaves in Spain and Portugal in the fifteenth century tended to come from Africa, via an overland trade that ended at the Straits of Gibraltar. The Portuguese and Spanish carried these ideas about social systems with them when they established their colonies in the New World. 4 | Introduction\n\nWhen the Spanish and Portuguese arrived and settled in the New World, they recognized that the natives were culturally very different. They accorded them a modicum of authority within their own communities but subjected everyone to imperial rule. The conquerors and colonists also brought along their own slaves, and some free blacks arrived both as conquerors and settlers. Soon enough there were children born of relations, legal and extralegal, among all of these different ethnic and social groups. In the Hispanic world, the offspring of a European and a native was called a mestizo. The child of an African and a European was a mulatto. There was no clear consensus on the label for the offspring of an African and a native, but a common term was zambo. Finally, a distinction came to be drawn between those Europeans born in the mother country and those born in the colony. A child of European parents born in the colony was a criollo (Creole). Eventually these distinctions became established in laws that prohibited certain groups from entering certain occupations. Needless to say, such a simple system of racial and ethnic identity could not remain simple. In each succeeding generation children would be born of different combinations. A child might have one parent who was a mulato and the other a mestiza. While some colonists attempted to establish a system to account for all of the different admixtures, the reality was that most folks considered themselves to be a member of one of the major groups, and generally were recognized by others as such. Consequently mixed-race persons who manifested an African phenotype, that is, they looked African, were normally considered mulatto, regardless of the exact percentage of African blood they might have inherited. Similarly a mixed-race person who looked like a native but who dressed in European style was considered a mestizo, while the same person—if he or she lived in an indigenous village and acted and dressed accordingly—would be considered a native. The social and economic systems reinforced each other. Persons of wealth generally were either from the Iberian Peninsula or Creoles, born in the New World. Various occupations, such as ranch hand, mine foreman, teamster, and the like, were generally the province of mestizos and mulattos. Lower occupations were relegated to slaves and sometimes to natives who had to provide labor as part of their tax and tribute obligation. At the same time, many persons who worked in the most elite households as cooks, cleaners, and personal servants were slaves. The general social system was understood by the participants. As a result, with a single glance one person could categorize anyone with whom they came into contact by looking at their phenotype (racial identity), their clothes, and their occupation. While independence\n\nIntroduction | 5\n\ndid away with slavery, and over the course of the nineteenth century many of the laws dictating ethnic categories for occupations were abolished, even today in much of Latin America people understand the social structure on a very deep level simply by looking at others. The role of native peoples in the history of Latin America has become a topic of immense interest in the last fifty years, after having been previously largely ignored. Scholars have come to study more native groups in the historical context, often using documentation sometimes written in native languages. As a result an entirely new perspective on the history of the region is beginning to appear. Even without the recent emphasis on the native perspective, for generations scholars have recognized that natives played a critical role in the history of the region. The native peoples were not passive observers, absorbing customs and cultures, but rather took an active role in dealing with the new reality that the presence of Europeans brought to their homes. This perspective is called “native agency”: that is, natives were active agents in their own lives, not simply passive in the face of the European cultural onslaught. It is remarkable that the vast majority of the native population of the Americas who received missionaries in the early colonial period did, in fact, adopt Christianity. While some conversions were accomplished through violence, the fact that a huge percentage of the native population remains Catholic to this day is striking. In the process of adopting Christianity, the native groups saw opportunities that were advantageous to them. In much of Latin American there was a tradition of a conquered people adopting the religion of the conqueror, which also played into this trend. Yet the Church also provided the natives with structures and institutions through which they could express their own social and political visions. Even though native peoples embraced Christianity, they did not entirely give up their old culture. Rather they understood Christianity through their old culture, just as the Europeans understood the native cultures through the lenses of Christianity and European culture. With time, however, many aspects of the old native culture either disappeared or were transformed into variants of a truly native Christian culture. This kind of blending of old and new was not unique to New World Christianity. Although Christianity began in the Middle East, by the fourth century it had been adopted by the Roman Empire as an imperial religion. By that time it had taken on a significant component of what might be called a Mediterranean or Roman culture. While native peoples adopted, and adapted, Christian institutions, they also remained at least partially in charge of their own destinies. Native 6 | Introduction\n\npeoples always exercised some control over their local affairs, which ran the gamut from political institutions for internal self-governance to various aspects of religious celebrations. As long as there were significant numbers of outside observers, such as parish priests, these activities tended to conform to the general norms tolerated by the imperial or national power. Once villages became isolated from the larger community, they began to develop along more autochthonous lines. As a result, in some regions there was a resurgence of nontraditional forms of Christianity in areas where native groups either were not well converted initially or where they had gone for many years with little or no contact with the larger Church. Similarly they developed local political structures to respond to their own reality and culture, which might be at odds with imperial or national cultures. These variants also caused friction as groups became more fully integrated into the national culture. Within the history of Latin America there is another theme that has important implications in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. From the time of the conquest until the present there has always been a tension between centralized control and diffuse local control. One of the first major political events in the New World occurred when Hernán Cortés, the conqueror of Mexico, opted to throw off control exercised over him by the governor of Cuba and establish himself as the leader of the conquest. Once the imperial systems were established in the New World, there was constant tension between decrees and regulations issued by the kings in Europe and the actual application of those decrees and regulations in the colonies. The independence of Latin America can be seen as a small victory for local control, as against the imperial control of the European monarchs. Nevertheless, with independence this tension did not disappear, for now the strains existed between control of the new country by elites of the capital city versus local control of the provinces and outlying cities by their local elite. Just as in the early United States there was tension between the large populous states like Virginia and New York versus the smaller less populated states like Delaware, so in Latin America politics immediately after independence split along lines of central versus regional control. Eventually each country would develop a system to accommodate this tension, but in much of Latin America, there remains an inherent division between the major metropolises and the regions. The issue of central versus local control also had an important role in the development of the Roman Church in Latin America. Because of the vast distance between the Americas and Europe, the first missionaries were largely independent from the scrutiny of superiors. There were no bishops\n\nIntroduction | 7\n\nlocally for several decades, and even when they did appear, the territories were so vast and communications so rudimentary that most regions developed largely independently from one another. Consequently there was a slow movement toward the centralization of the Church. The kings of Spain and Portugal claimed authority over the Church, as will be seen, but certainly local bishops had more immediate claims. When independence came to Latin America, any claims that the monarchs might have had regarding control over the Church were moot, and the Papacy began to exercise far more control over the Church than it had previously. It was not until the twentieth century that all of the details of that control were finally resolved, and the Church fell completely under papal control. At the same time that questions regarding ultimate authority over the Church were being worked out, individuals were living and dying as members of local congregations. From the first moment of contact, some missionaries spread the Gospel in a manner that emphasized the emulation of Christ: teaching through example. Others believed that the Gospel needed to be spread by preaching, by engaging the natives in discussion and teaching the rules of the faith. Just as natives claimed agency for their own political lives, they also embraced the Church for the benefits that it could provide them. There was then yet another tension over the degree to which the various institutions of the Church needed to be controlled by the Church or could be delegated to the faithful. Similarly, some organizations within the Catholic Church did not willingly submit to the authority of the local bishop. And so there were tensions in the Church over local and popular religious expression and the central authority of the bishop. In the nineteenth century this tension continued as national governments sought to exercise control over the Church in their territories, only to be denied that authority by the pope. In the parishes there continued to be tensions between popular or native religions and the formal teaching of the Church regarding submission to authority. The Church in general suffered from a lack of clergy in the nineteenth century. Parishes seldom saw a priest and bishops remained isolated from the vast majority of the faithful. Popular associations sprang up to bridge the gap wherein local people created prayer groups or mutual aid societies, but not all were willing to be subjected to the supervision of the bishops. Finally, the bishops encouraged new associations to provide social support services, which they could more directly control, in order to undermine the influence of the popular associations. In the end, this endeavor too reflected the working out of tensions between local authority and centralized control. 8 | Introduction\n\nWith these considerations, the general outline for this book is a chronological one, beginning with the roots of Latin American Christianity in Spain and in the local native cultures. Chapter 1 outlines both the history of the Church on the Iberian Peninsula and the religious experiences of the natives of the New World. The Church as it arrived in the New World was in fact a local variant of the Catholic Church, namely one that developed out of the Iberian Peninsula. By the late fifteenth century in Europe, each region had given a slightly different flavor to the Catholic Church. In Ireland, for example, there was an ancient monastic tradition that had a deep influence on the Church there. On the Iberian Peninsula seven centuries of warfare and contact with the Muslims had created a very special type of Catholic Church. It is important to understand the Iberian background because it colored the way the Spanish and Portuguese missionaries would approach the evangelization of the New World. Experience on the Iberian Peninsula had encouraged the hierarchy and structure of the Church, and royal government itself, to adapt in favor of warfare and the taking of new territories. This too would have an important effect on the spread of Christianity in the New World. This first chapter also provides an overview of native religion in the New World, looking specifically at the religions of some of the ancient American cultures, such as the Aztec, Maya, and Inca, along with general observations about tribal religions. The native peoples of the Americas would interpret the Christian message through the cultural lens of their existing religious beliefs. The end result of this dialogue between the missionary and the native generally was some type of hybrid understanding. Chapter 2 studies the practical issues related to the so-called discovery of the New World by the Iberian powers, and their negotiations with the Papacy to exercise control over the Church in the newly found territories. The Iberian kingdoms had centuries of experience confronting non-Christian nations, due to their location facing Africa, and resulting from numerous voyages from Europe down the African coast. The monarchs received certain incentives from the Papacy to confront Muslims on the Iberian Peninsula and to spread Christianity as they voyaged down the African coast. These rights and privileges were eventually extended to the New World as part of a complex legal system, which was developed in the sixteenth century for this very purpose. The conquest of the New World forms the theme for chapter 3 wherein the military aspects and the religious conversion of the natives are considered. An older generation envisioned the early evangelization of the New World as a “spiritual conquest.” Nevertheless, most recent scholarship finds it to be far\n\nIntroduction | 9\n\nmore nuanced than that. While armed forces did accompany missionaries, or vice versa, most of the early conversions to Christianity did not occur at the tip of a sword or barrel of a gun. The process was far less violent and far more intimate. Early on, dozens of missionaries arrived to spread the Gospel as best they could. The chapter looks at the different groups of missionaries and their different techniques in order to get a better overview of the process. The colonial period, as noted earlier, lasted for some three hundred years. The Church was one of a handful of important institutions in Latin America at that time, and chapter 4 looks at how the Church developed in Latin America during this long period. The Church hierarchy played an important social and economic role in the colonies, while missionaries and parish priests became the points of contact for most people. Thanks to the charity of the faithful and individual desires for salvation, the Church also became one of the wealthiest institutions in the colony, and served as the principle economic engine—other than trade and mining—for the colonial world. Chapter 5 focuses on the reforms that the new ruling house of Spain, the Bourbons, brought about in the colonial system in general and the Church in particular. At roughly the same time, the Marquis of Pombal became the leading advisor to the king of Portugal and implemented a series of similar reforms for the Portuguese empire. Important in both of the sets of reforms was to bring the Catholic Church more fully under the control of the monarch. Linked to this effort, both the Portuguese and Spanish monarchs expelled the very powerful Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, from their overseas colonies, and eventually from all of their realms. The monarchs also set about taking control of the great wealth that the Church had amassed over the centuries. Consequently, this was an era of tremendous change for the Church in Latin America. Political events in Europe precipitated the movements for independence in Latin America, and this process is the theme for chapter 6. It looks at the roads to independence and also the various discussions that occurred in the former colonies regarding the role of the Church in the newly independent countries. The central debate was the degree to which powers enjoyed by the king of Spain might be inherited by the governments of the former Spanish colonies. The debates were also a means whereby two major political movements worked out their differences in each country. The patterns established in Mexico, for example, did not hold true in Argentina. Chapter 7 continues to focus on the political turmoil that surrounded independence as the two major political movements, liberalism and conservatism, confront one another in the new countries. In each country the 10 | Introduction\n\npositions staked out by each party, while being similar, had important local nuances. Involved in this political debate was the role of the Church. While liberals tended to support a model similar to the United States with a strict separation of Church and state, there were instances where, in order to gain more control over the Church, they embraced highly controlling and centralized authority over the Church. Conversely, while the conservatives wished to retain the centrality of the importance of the Church within the nation state, they did so through separating the Church from the state. Also at issue in these debates was the strong economic role of the Church, a legacy it had carried over from the colonial period. The case of Brazil, however, was unique. While independent, Brazil was still ruled by a monarch, and this chapter also discusses the varying role of the Church within imperial Brazil. The late nineteenth century and early twentieth century saw a wide variety of popular religious expressions, some of which were violently opposed by the national government. In chapter 8 we see how political developments finally fostered the opening up of many political systems to additional parties beyond the traditional liberal and conservative. The issue of the role of the Church was an important one in the political platforms of these new parties. In Brazil the empire finally came to a end with the overthrow of the emperor and the implementation of a republic. The Church played an important role in both the issues leading up to the revolt and the political developments thereafter. The Mexican Revolution and other political turmoils of the early twentieth century provide the point of departure for chapter 9. Throughout Latin America in the early twentieth century change was in the air. In Mexico it came through a revolution; in other countries it came via the ballot box. The Church increasingly looked upon social movements with concern that they might draw people away from the Church. As a result, many bishops followed papal suggestions and encouraged the development of Catholic Action groups, wherein groups of the faithful would come together to address important social issues of the time. The confluence of political change and the Church moving out of direct political action mark two important trends for this period. Chapter 10 looks at the Church in Latin America in the middle decades of the twentieth century. This period was marked by military governments, deep social tensions, and turmoil. The Church began to develop its own social message while remaining at arms length from the political process. Some priests, however, embraced radical political movements and revolutionary struggle. The period also saw the beginnings of a way of doing theol\n\nIntroduction | 11\n\nogy, which became known as liberation theology. Importantly, the bishops of the region also began periodic meetings to address important social and economic issues that transcended national boundaries. The ultimate chapter brings the history of the Church into the twenty-first century. On the political scene the military governments largely disappeared. The Church embraced liberation theology and then began to back away from it. Native groups rediscovered their indigenous spirituality, Africans continued spiritual movements based in their cultural heritage, and Evangelical and Pentecostal Protestant groups began to make inroads in traditional Catholic areas. In short, the Church in Latin America in the first decade of the twenty-first century no longer enjoys the monopoly that it once did but still continues on the forefront of many of the important debates in the region. This book is meant to serve as an introduction to the major themes and issues of the Catholic Church in Latin America. The literature is large and growing constantly. Without question, the history of the Catholic Church in Latin America is a very important facet of the history of the region. No other single institution has had such an impact in so many places over such a long period of time, and it is core to much of what we know about that part of the world. In each country in each period, the Church confronted different issues and different specifics. The best that this book can do is to provide a general framework, a set of guideposts to lead the reader through this complex and fascinating history.\n\n12 | Introduction\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\n1\n\nThousands of pilgrims gather in the mammoth sanctuary of Santiago Campostela, in the northwestern corner of Spain, to celebrate the life of Saint James the Greater, brother of the apostle Saint John. A huge censer (a large pierced metal ball in which incense is burned) called the botafumeiro, swings on a chain from the highest point in the transept, making long passages over the heads of the pilgrims. The faithful wear cockle shells on their hats and sleeves, the symbol of the saint. The pilgrimage route to Santiago is one of the most traveled medieval trails of Europe. The focus of this devotion, Saint James, is credited with being the first Christian missionary to the region, arriving within a decade of the death of Christ. A richly dressed Aztec noble stands atop a tall pyramid. He has a feathered headdress, and shell rattles on his ankle. He dances while playing a flute. He is surrounded by priests dressed in black. Their robes and hair are matted with dried blood. The nobleman performs a brief ritual, pricking his ear lobe and placing a drop of blood on a piece of paper. The paper is then burned in a large censer along with copal, incense made from pine resin. The multitudes break into song, dancing in the courtyard of the temple.\n\nReconquest The story of the Catholic Church in Latin America, begins with the Church as a religious and political entity as it developed in Spain and Portugal in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There is no doubt that Christianity has deep roots in the Iberian world. The missionaries who would carry the banner of Christ to the Americas came from an environment in which Christianity had thrived, suffered, and recovered again and again over fifteen hundred years. Yet for nearly all of its history on the Iberian Peninsula, Christianity never\n\n| 13\n\nenjoyed exclusive status. Even in early Roman times, significant Jewish populations existed there. Within the religiously pluralistic society of the peninsula, Christianity gained a strong hold in Iberia. Its predominance as a state religion was confirmed and augmented when the Roman Empire adopted the faith officially in 312 CE. This position of dominance was threatened in the eighth century when Muslims from North Africa overran the peninsula. In 711 CE, as part of the initial Muslim expansion following the death of Mohammed, Muslim forces crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and occupied the Iberian Peninsula. Within less than a decade of the invasion, the Muslims had defeated all of the existing states lying south of the two northern mountain ranges, the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian mountains. The nearly eight-hundred-year period in which the Christians of the north engaged in an on-again, off-again war against the Muslims is called the Reconquista or Reconquest. The Reconquest did not involve continual warfare throughout those eight centuries, but rather several sporadic eras of conflict. Moreover, the initial conquest by the Muslims hardly swept away all traces of Christianity. For the first few centuries under Muslim rule, Christians and Jews remained free to practice their religion. In reality, Christians constituted the majority in most areas. While tensions could and did flare up, in general the Christians lived peaceably under Muslim domination. Indeed, the taxes they paid due to their status as “People of the Book” under Muslim rule were frequently less than they had paid to their older Christian overlords. From the tenth through the thirteenth centuries, the Reconquest faced a changing landscape. On the Muslim side African influence increased. Several Muslim fundamentalist movements originating in sub-Saharan and North Africa spilled over into the Iberian Peninsula. The most pronounced of these were advanced by the Almoravids, who preached an extreme form of Islam. Their name later became synonymous with the term “Muslim” in Spain, and is the origin of the term “Moor.” By the middle phases, the Reconquest also took on an important philosophical character as a holy war. As the Muslims became more extreme in their embrace of Islam, so the Christians also emphasized the crusade-like quality of the conflict. Finally the papacy came to recognize the struggle against the Iberian Muslims as part and parcel of a greater crusade against Muslims throughout the Mediterranean world, extending spiritual benefits to those who participated in the warfare. The Christians of the north developed several institutions and mechanisms to assist both in the actual warfare and in the incorporation of the newly conquered areas. In both the warfare and the resettlement the Church played an important role. In order to assist with military operations against 14 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nthe Muslims, the Christian kings of the north of the Iberian Peninsula enlisted the aid of warriors from France and other areas of Northern Europe. As early as the 1060s the pope offered dispensations to warriors who fought the Muslims on the Iberian Peninsula. The Christian lords of the north would invite foreign nobles to join in the Reconquest, offering them temporal control over the lands they gained, providing they pledged fealty to the king for whom they fought. Important counties, such as Portugal, were carved out of the Muslim-held territories by these noblemen. The Christian realms were a patchwork of contesting authorities. Local nobles enjoyed many privileges, including the right to collect local duties and taxes, control the local judiciary, and make appointments to Church offices. Some of these privileges came as a result of participation in the Reconquest, others had simply been accumulated from time immemorial. In the later Middle Ages the local nobles exercised a great deal of authority and frequently opposed the designs of the monarchs to wrest that authority from them. Cities and towns acquired certain privileges from the monarch and other nobles that allowed them to exercise a degree of independence. These rights and privileges were known as fueros (forais in Portuguese). Some cities held the privilege of always being called to parliaments, known in Spanish and Portuguese as Cortes. Other privileges included the right to hold markets, to collect certain local taxes and duties, and especially to have an independent judiciary to hear cases involving local laws and customs. Additionally, during the Reconquest, the Christian monarchs often granted additional rights and privileges to towns that organized units to fight in the wars. In order to stabilize the frontier between Christian- and Muslim-controlled territories, the monarchs also often granted special privileges to residents of border towns both to encourage settlement and also in recognition of their more tenuous link to the monarch because of distance and turmoil. Nevertheless, by the late fifteenth century, the monarchs of Spain and Portugal viewed the fueros/forais as troublesome and as limitations on regal authority. Ecclesiastical institutions also enjoyed a certain independence from the crown. They generally benefited from the fuero eclesiástico—fora eclesiastico in Portuguese—or clerical immunity. This fuero specifically granted members of the clergy immunity from royal courts. If a priest was accused of a civil crime, or of many petty criminal offenses, he had the privilege of having the suit heard in an ecclesiastical, rather than a royal or local, court. This privilege was extended to all clerics, priests and nuns, friars and monks, as well as to members of some of the military orders, and many members of\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 15\n\necclesiastical households, such as retainers of bishops and the like. It also extended to the lands owned or controlled by these individuals and institutions, such that the crown could neither exercise justice upon them physically nor collect taxes from them. Alfonso X of Castile (1221–84), known as El Sabio, “the Wise,” initiated an early attempt to curb the power of the nobles and cities. A very devout Christian, his Cantigas de Santa María (Songs to the Virgin Mary) represent a high point in early Castilian letters. His legal code, the Siete Partidas (the Seven Books or Parts) represents a significant attempt to regain power to the crown at the expense of the cities, towns, nobles, and the Church. Alfonso based his code on several basic principles. Central to these was the notion that the core function of the king was judge. All other functions emanated from that. Alfonso also posited that royal law superseded local law, and he envisioned a uniform royal law that could be applied throughout the realm in spite of local laws and jurisdictions. Alfonso’s successors would extend this principle so that the decision of any local court could be appealed to the royal courts, effectively challenging the Church and local nobles. In the twelfth century two Christian orders, the Knights Templar and the Hospitalers of Saint John, arrived in Spain. These pious gentlemen had organized themselves into military-religious orders to seek to regain the Holy Land and to assist in the crusade against the Muslims. They provided an important example for the rest of Europe. For centuries warriors had felt moral conflict about killing vis-à-vis the teachings of the Church. The establishment of military-religious orders granted the blessings of the Church to the knight for his calling. The mission of the warrior was linked to that of the monk in that both participated in a unified effort, waging war, and ministering at the same time. On the Iberian Peninsula, these orders spawned several imitators. The most famous of these were the military-religious orders of Calatrava, Alcántara, and Santiago in Spain, and the Order of Christ and Order of Aviz in Portugal. Although the Order of Calatrava was the oldest, Santiago became the most important in Castile. The military-religious Order of Santiago was founded with a dual purpose. As with the other Iberian orders, participation in the Reconquest was an important vocation. Yet the other vocation of the Order of Santiago was to provide hospitality to travelers and hospitals to the sick. Eventually the order came to protect pilgrims who traveled through northern Spain en route to the shrine of Saint James at Santiago Campostela. The military-religious orders manifested a perfect combination of ministries to assist in the Reconquest: a military branch to defeat the Muslims 16 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\non the field of battle, and a religious branch to provide moral, physical, and spiritual assistance. In recognition of their service to the crown, they received grants of lands from which they would receive taxes and over which they exercised temporal authority. Large sections of the middle of the Iberian Peninsula fell under the control of the military religious orders when Alfonso VIII of Castile granted huge tracts to protect the approaches to Toledo from the south, west, and east. The orders then chose officers to whom they entrusted the oversight of the territory. The territories were called encomiendas1 and the officers who administered them were called comendadores or encomenderos. These officers received a stipend for their efforts and served at the pleasure of the order. The ultimate rights over the administration of these encomiendas remained vested in the order. The orders were also called upon to populate the region, founding towns and villages to better hold and pacify the local area. The orders received certain judicial and fiscal privileges in these territories: the right to collect local taxes and duties and the right to control the judiciary. The Church participated in the Reconquest in other ways. The famous missionary orders of the Middle Ages were created to address the demands of converting the heathens, bringing heretics back into the Catholic faith, and renewing the faith of the community at large. One of these, the Dominicans, was founded by a Spaniard, Domingo de Guzmán, who would later be canonized as Saint Dominic, Santo Domingo. He came to believe that the proper method of bringing people to the faith, be they heathen, heretic, or already Christian, was through preaching. He developed a Preaching Order of mendicant brothers whose mission was preaching the Gospel. The friars of the Dominican Order took an active role in the reestablishment of the Catholic faith in the newly conquered regions of the Iberian Peninsula. Since the time of Constantine in the early fourth century, Christianity had developed in a world in which the limits of political authority and the limits of ecclesiastical authority merged. The world of Christendom was politically and religiously homogeneous. Those who differed in faith also followed a different political system. Consequently, while some non-Christians physically were living within the state, they could not be part of the political state because their religious faith differed. They were excluded from holding office or taking a role in public affairs. From the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries, the atmosphere of religious tolerance that had marked the earlier centuries disappeared. Ultimately, the Reconquest became a crusade against the Muslims in which the Jews were also targeted, as the Christians began to develop a new ideology of “One Faith, One Law, One King.” This\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 17\n\nstance was far more marked in the Spanish kingdoms than in Portugal. Portugal achieved its modern borders by the middle of the thirteenth century. Although it continued to assist in the ongoing struggle against the Muslims, the kingdom was far more concerned about Castile and León than about a Muslim threat. Moreover, Portugal increasingly looked to England and France as allies, as it feared the growing power of Castile and Leon. At the end of the fifteenth century, Queen Isabel of Castile and King Fernando of Aragón found themselves as the inheritors of a complicated system of authority, which had developed in the Christian Kingdoms of Spain. At this time what is now modern Spain consisted of two independent kingdoms, León and Aragón. Castile, in turn, contained yet other kingdoms and jurisdictions such as León, Asturias, and Navarre. In the late 1460s, Isabel’s brother, Enrique, declared her to be his heir. At approximately the same time she accepted a marriage to Fernando, the heir of the Aragonese throne. Isabel ascended to the combined Castilian and Leonese throne through a civil war. The civil war pitted her supporters against those of her half-sister, who was backed by the Portuguese crown. The war split the Castilian nobility and was also a war between Aragon and Portugal, each backing a different sister. Isabel survived the civil war. Yet because of the demands of the Reconquest, her predecessors had given much power away to the other estates: towns, the nobility, and the Church. Following the civil war there were other uprisings of the Spanish nobility against royal authority. Fernando and Isabel recognized the political and ideological value of conducting a war against a foreign enemy in order to galvanize sentiment at home. The Muslim kingdom of Granada provided them with a foreign enemy on soil, which the Spaniards claimed was their own, unjustly taken in the Muslim invasion of 711. The monarchs were successful in conquering Granada and in increasing their own control over their domains. At just the same moment that they were engaged in the final assaults on Granada, Christopher Columbus offered them the opportunity to continue the efforts at conquest beyond the bounds of Europe. As we know, he eventually gained their support. For their part, Fernando and Isabel, for having led the Reconquest of Granada, were awarded the title of the “Catholic kings” by Pope Alexander VI. While the reign of Isabel and Fernando marked the end of the Reconquest, it was also a period of reform within the Church, both in the ecclesiastical hierarchy and in the religious orders. The efforts to reform the Church had three main targets. One was the concern over orthodoxy and the threat posed by the presence of unconverted Muslims and Jews in Christian Spain. 18 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nThe second was the ecclesiastical hierarchy of bishops and archbishops who had gained considerable power during the Reconquest and whose offices were frequently points of contention between the monarchs and the papacy. Third, the religious orders of Spain had needed reform for years. The religious character of Spain at the time of the Granada war had become less tolerant of the Jews and Muslims. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Northern European states had expelled their Jewish populations, many of whom took refuge in Spain and Portugal, among other longtime Jewish residents. Jews were openly welcomed by the Iberian monarchs in the Middle Ages because of the skills they brought with them, particularly in the areas of finance and administration. As the Reconquest entered its final stages, however, religious tolerance turned against the Jews, who often were among the wealthiest subjects of the realm. The final success of the Reconquest also brought the expulsion not just of the Muslims but also of the Jews from the Spain and Portugal. Jews who converted to Christianity were known as conversos; Muslims who converted to Christianity were known as moriscos. While the act of conversion protected these individuals from the immediate threat of expulsion, jealousies subsequently occurred since many conversos were both wealthy and powerful. Furthermore, the popular opinion was that some conversos had betrayed their conversion to Christianity and secretly continued to practice Judaism. The moriscos faced all of the same issues of discrimination that were faced by the conversos, with status issues added to the mix, because moriscos who remained in Spain tended to be of a lower economic status than the conversos who remained. As part of the larger program to extend Christendom within the Christian kingdoms, in 1478 the monarchs requested that the pope grant them permission to establish the Holy Office of the Inquisition under royal control. The Inquisition was historically an institution attached to the office of the local bishop as the ordinary of the diocese.2 When the pope agreed with the request, what had been an essentially ecclesiastical institution was taken over by the state. Strictly speaking the Inquisition did not have jurisdiction over nonbelievers, merely over those who had professed the Christian faith and been baptized. In Portugal the Inquisition was not formally established until 1536. The presence of so many Christians who had recently converted from Islam and Judaism caused concerns about the orthodoxy of their faith; for decades the conversos and moriscos would be viewed as second-class Christians. During this same period, all of the elite institutions and ecclesiastical councils increasingly demanded that aspirants for office and preference dem\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 19\n\nonstrate purity of lineage, limpieza de sangre: that is, to demonstrate that they were not descended from Muslims, Jews, or heretics within four generations. Purity of blood statutes had the effect of creating a caste system in the Iberian Peninsula. Because such statutes came to rule in the Church, universities, most religious orders, the military-religious orders, and most government positions, conversos and moriscos were prohibited from a wide range of occupations and important offices. The crown could, and did, provide some relief from these statutes by waiving the purity of blood statutes in some specific instances. Nevertheless, the statutes developed clearly defined categories based upon lineage and ethnic origin. The other area of concern regarding orthodoxy came from within the Christian community. In Spain and in the rest of Europe many thinkers began to question the power of the Catholic Church and some of its practices. Two major reforms emerged in Spain, centering on the relationship of the Church to the crown and on the internal organization of the religious orders. Many believed that the clergy in particular needed reform. As a result of long-term traditions and privileges granted during the Reconquest, the Church hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, and cathedral chapters remained well beyond the control of the monarchs. While bishops and archbishops exercised dominant control in their territories, they were subject to scrutiny only from the papacy. Traditionally these princes of the Church were elected by the clergy of the diocese, or archdiocese, and certainly by the members of the cathedral chapter, those high-ranking clerics assigned to ceremonial and administrative posts in the principle church of the diocese.3 Yet the papacy held the ultimate right to approve the election, or appointment, and to confer on the candidate all of the ecclesiastical authority of the office. In the fifteenth century many of the main dioceses suffered from internal divisions, which made the selection of a bishop nearly impossible. In light of this, the crown would also put forward candidates, and the papacy would exercise its right to make the final approval. Yet the papacy used this situation to place its own favorites in the leading cathedrals of Spain. When disputes occurred in the selection of new bishops, Isabel and Fernando pressed the papacy to recognize what the monarchs felt were their innate powers. Embodied in the Siete Partidas, the legal code of Alfonso X, was the principle that the monarch could mediate in elections for bishops and had the final authority to present the candidate to the papacy, called the right of patronage. After several decades of negotiations, and concessions on both sides, in 1486 Pope Innocent VIII granted the right of patronage to the Catholic kings in the territory of Granada, 20 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nwhere the monarchs were conducting the last war of the Reconquest. Finally, in 1523, the Spanish crown received the general right of patronage throughout its realms. Nevertheless, although the crown could appoint bishops, archbishops, members of cathedral chapters, and even parish priests, it did not follow that all of these officials would necessarily support the crown in all endeavors. Priests who serve in parishes and who are subject to the authority of the local bishop are called secular or diocesan priests. A problem of secular priests was that they tended to manifest lax morality and insufficient training. From the Middle Ages on, the local parish priest did not always represent the highest goals and aspirations of the clergy. They were often poorly trained and venal; lapses in priestly celibacy were widespread. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries there were renewed attempts to improve the quality of the clergy. The kings appointed bishops with the charge that they reform the clergy. The monarchs mandated that parishes be filled through competitive exams, to select the most highly qualified priests. In many regions local nobles clung to their rights of presentation to specific parishes. Bishops and others were loath to give up the right to appoint persons to these moderately lucrative positions. The religious orders in Spain also went through a great period of reform in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Religious orders differ from the secular, or diocesan, clergy in that their members take additional vows beyond the normal clerical vows, and they pledge to live according to a special rule, regula (Latin for rule). As a result, members of religious orders are called members of the regular clergy. In Spain, and throughout Europe, many of the monasteries and convents no longer followed their rules with the originally intended rigor. Morality became lax, and the spiritual aspects of religious life were lost to more mundane and secular concerns. Many members of the regular clergy sought to reinvigorate their orders and to seek a simpler form of spirituality. These goals had much in common with the royal policy that also favored reform of the monasteries and convents, if for no other reason than to bring them more closely under royal scrutiny. Religious orders frequently held large endowments, and their very structure made them somewhat immune from royal interference, since they had their own internal hierarchies and reported eventually directly to the pope. The Catholic kings supported efforts to reform the regular clergy. In some instances this support was merely tacit, refusing to intervene when differing factions might appeal to the crown to mediate. In other instances they took a more active role. Quite simply, the Church in Spain and Portu\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 21\n\ngal at the time of the discovery of the New World was in a state of flux as it transitioned from the epoch of the Reconquest to the more modern era. When the Spanish and Portuguese arrived in the New World, they brought with them the legacy of the Reconquest, and of the political and ecclesiastical history that preceded them on the Iberian Peninsula. The institutions that developed during those eight centuries would assist the Iberian powers as they sought to conquer and settle a New World. The attitudes and beliefs that they carried with them would color their interactions with the native peoples they found there. Christianity, and specifically Christianity as practiced on the Iberian Peninsula, would become the model toward which missionaries would guide the newly discovered natives as they attempted to Christianize them.\n\nOld World/New World While the story of the Catholic Church in Latin America begins in Europe, the contribution of the native peoples of the Americas is an equally important theme. The natives of the New World had developed their own forms of religious expression, completely divorced from any in the Old World. When missionaries arrived in the New World it was in fact the first time that Europeans had moved beyond the Old World of Eurasia and Africa, and beyond the Eurasian religious and philosophical tradition. The diversity of religious expression in the New World posed real challenges to the Spanish missionaries as they attempted to spread Christianity. It is impossible to talk about a single religious orientation of all of the native peoples of Latin America because of the tremendous geographical and cultural area to be encompassed, from Patagonia to California and from Florida to Chile. The native peoples of the Americas had a wide variety of religious expressions. Natives of Central Mexico, Central America, and the Andean highlands lived in highly organized sedentary societies. They had a complex religious system with a panoply of deities and a complex liturgical calendar. Peoples living in such areas as Florida or the American Southwest, the Argentine pampas or Amazon forests, had a more nomadic life, with only tribal-level political organizations. Their religions were less state-structured. More peoples lived under the highly organized state systems of Mexico, Central America, and the Andes, and thus we will first consider the social structures and religious notions of the Aztec, Maya, and Inca,4 the principal civilizations in these areas at the time of the conquest, before studying the more nomadic or less centrally organized groups. 22 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nMaya and Aztec Anthropologists call the region in which the Aztecs and the Maya lived Mesoamerica, defined in general as that area south of what is now Northern Mexico down into Central America. The arid regions in the north of modern-day Mexico were home to quite different peoples in terms of their cultural organization. Similarly, from what is now Costa Rica on to the south, the cultures were different from those found in Mesoamerica. Both the Aztecs and the Maya are reflections of the larger Mesoamerican culture. The two cultures shared some similarities and reflected some differences. An important difference is that they spoke two totally different, unrelated, languages. The Aztec language is known as Nahuatl; the Maya speak Maya, with many modern dialects. Both languages are still widely spoken in Mexico and Central America. Several of the Maya dialects were mutually intelligible, yet others were unique enough not to be understood. The two languages, Maya and Nahuatl, are members of two completely separate language families and are as totally distinct from one another as English and Chinese are.5 Nahuatl is part of a language family known as Uto-Aztecan, while Maya is part of the language family known simply as Maya. While the Maya and Aztec cultures used two different languages, they shared some important similarities. The two cultures shared some gods. One of the most important gods was the god of rain and water, called Tlaloc by the Aztecs, and Chac for the Maya. The iconography or the way each culture depicted him is quite similar. He was shown with big goggled eyes, a long, often elephant-like, nose, a snarling mouth, and large ornamental ear plugs. The Maya and the Aztecs also had similar number systems. While Europeans use a decimal system, based on ten, the ancient Mesoamericans used a vigesimal system, based on twenty. Nevertheless, the Maya and the Aztecs had slightly different ways of writing their numbers. The Maya enjoyed an extremely complex calendrical system. Both the Maya and Aztecs had a basic system that used two distinct calendars at the same time: a solar calendar of 365 days and a ritual calendar of 260 days. These two calendars worked in conjunction with one another. The solar calendar was very similar to the European calendar. It consisted of eighteen months with twenty days each, with five extra days. It is unclear whether the Aztecs and Maya used interstitial days, leap days, and so the calendar eventually could have failed to keep up with the seasonal changes. The ritual calendar had thirteen numbers and twenty day names. Each name was paired with a number, but when the count reached thirteen, it was necessary to start\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 23\n\nover with one again. Upon reaching the end of the list of names it started over again with the first name again, until 260 days had passed, and the calendar returned to the starting point. The solar and ritual calendars ran concurrently. Each day had both a date in the solar calendar and a date in the ritual calendar. Each discreet combination of dates from the two calendars would repeat only every fifty-two years. As a consequence of this calendar, the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations had a century, which was in essence only fifty-two years. Both of these calendars were important for religious celebrations. In the ritual calendar, individual days were assigned values, good luck or bad luck: each day, and each hour in the day, was ruled by a different god who brought to that day a host of characteristics. Personal names were given to infants based upon their date of birth in that calendar. The solar calendar provided guidance for agriculture and certain large-scale religious festivals. Although the Maya constituted one of the New World’s most important pre-Columbian civilizations, by the time the Spanish arrived they had passed into an era of decline. The Classic Maya period (250 CE–900 CE) was characterized by a number of very powerful city-states, which engaged in trade and warfare among themselves. They shared a common religion, writing system, artistic expression, and in short were of a single cultural identity. Some of the more powerful states controlled trade routes from deep in Central America up into the Mexican highlands. In the tenth century, however, there was a great disturbance. The cities of the Classic Maya fell into disrepair, and the region was invaded by peoples from Central Mexico. The Maya shared many of the same religious ideas as their predecessors of the Classic period. They conceived of the world as existing between thirteen heavens and nine underworlds, a view they held in common with other Mesoamerican peoples. The visible world was four-cornered, with the four Atlantean figures holding up the sky. In the middle, as the central point of existence, was a great ceiba tree holding up the pinnacle of the sky. The Maya pantheon was populated by scores of gods. There seems to have been a notion of a supreme god, Hunab Ku, but he was not as widely recognized as Itzamná, “Lizard House,” and his consort, Ix Chel, “Lady Rainbow.” The other gods seem to have been their offspring. Equally important were the Chacs, the gods of rain. The Maya envisioned three layers to the world: the underworld, the surface of the world, and the vault of heaven. The underworld was known as Xibalba, where rulers and shaman went in their trances. Xibalba was dark, dank, a world of rotting matter, which fed the vital forces of the surface of the earth. The Maya paid particular reverence to caves since they were the lim24 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\ninal places where the underworld and the surface world met. Mountains had a similar role in that they were points where the surface world met the starry world of the sky. Within this world sacredness was concentrated at specific points, like the caves and mountains. Temples sought to imitate the natural points of power and duplicate them through human invention. As with other Mesoamerican peoples, the Maya believed the world had gone through a series of creations. They believed that the current existence of the world was the fourth creation. In each of the earlier eras the world had been destroyed because of imperfections. As noted, the regulating and celebrating of the passage of time was an important feature of the Maya religion. It was believed that the world continually passed through cycles and that by precise record keeping one could predict the future. The Maya fixated on the passage of time and had a calendar, known as the Long Count, that measured every day since the creation of the world, more than five thousand years ago. The Maya placed great importance in sacrifice, which not only propitiated the gods but also allowed one to enter into a personal relationship with the divine. Sacrifice was important to feed and nourish the gods. The Maya practiced human sacrifice, although not on the level of other natives peoples of Mesoamerica. Far more common among the Maya were various forms of personal blood sacrifice and the sacrifice of goods, such as birds, pottery, small animals, corn, cacao, paper, rubber, and incense. Personal blood sacrifice, along with the ingestion of alcohol or hallucinogens, was a second form of religious practice. These allowed the person offering the blood sacrifice, or ingesting the alcohol or hallucinogen, to commune more directly with the gods through visions and altered states. Thus, the leaders of the Maya states would commonly offer prodigious blood sacrifice to enter into a trance-like state. In these trances the noble lords would go through spiritual travels and converse with the deities for the benefit of their people. This role of mediator between this world and the world of the gods gave the leaders great political power. Unique among New World civilizations, the Maya possessed an intricate writing system. Using stylized symbols with fixed sound values, this elegant form of writing allowed them to keep precise historical accounts and record other important data. Archeologists have begun recently to decipher the glyphs and recover much Maya history and religion. While the Maya had established cities and a highly organized civilization as early as the fourth century CE, the Aztecs, or more properly the Mexica, do not appear in historic records until about 1250. The Mexica originally came from an area in Northwestern Mexico, where they were hunters and gathers.\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 25\n\nSometime around the year 1111, they began a migration southward through the central plateau of Mexico, and in about 1250 they entered into what we now call the Valley of Mexico. The Valley of Mexico had been inhabited for many thousands of years prior to the arrival of the Mexica. According to the Mexica legends, they were led on by their tribal god, Huitzilopochtli (Hummingbird-on-the-Left). After many years of migration, he indicated the place where they should found their new city: an eagle resting on a cactus. In 1325 the Mexica founded their city, Tenochtitlan (later known as Mexico City), on a small island in the middle of a lake in the Valley of Mexico. The Mexica rapidly dominated the older civilizations that occupied the Valley of Mexico and eventually went on to conquer a large part of central Mexico. Their civilization was still rapidly developing and their empire still expanding at the time of the arrival of the Spanish. Just as the Maya believed that the world had been created four times, the Mexica believed that they were living in the fifth creation. Each of the previous creations ended with a cataclysm. The current epoch began when the gods gathered at the ancient city of Teotihuacan, just north of modern day Mexico City. There they performed rituals and sacrifice by bleeding themselves (auto-sacrifice), thus creating mankind and the current world. Once mankind had gained life, the gods commanded that humans should sacrifice similarly, in order to feed the gods who had created the world, and to maintain the essential balance of the universe. The sacrifice the gods demanded was human sacrifice: the sacrifice of hearts and of blood. The Aztecs believed that without sacrifice, chaos would invade the world: the orderly processes of the sun and the moon would be stopped, chaos would ensue, and the world would be destroyed. The pantheon of gods was headed by Ometecuhtli, the Lord of Duality, and his consort Omecihuatl, the Lady of Duality. The Mexica especially revered Huitzilopochitl. Yet Tlaloc, the god of rain, shared the most prominent place on the major temple of the capital Tenochtitlan with him. Another important god was Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent or Plumed Twin. Quetzalcoatl was a culture god, the patron of the arts. Most of the Mexica religious beliefs were shared with the other people who lived in the Valley of Mexico, even though the Mexica were latecomers to the region. The Mexica believed in an afterlife: a series of heavens. The factor that determined where a person went in the afterlife was not how he or she had lived their life in an ethical or moral sense; rather, the determining factor was exactly how they died. A warrior who died on the field of battle went to the highest heaven, to the heaven of Tonatiuh, the sun god, and accompanied 26 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nhim on his heavenly journey for four years, only to return to earth as a hummingbird. A woman who died in childbirth went to the same heaven, because such a woman was seen as a warrior fighting to bring forth the infant. The Mexica also had an institution of confession. If they had committed some act against the moral strictures of society, they had the opportunity to confess that sin and to go on with their lives. This was something done only under extraordinary circumstances: normally, only once in a lifetime. The confession was made specifically to the Tezcatlipoca, Smoking-Mirror, one of the supreme Mexica gods, and Tlazolteotl, goddess of love. Confronted by so many strange and different practices, the Spaniards were surprised because of the similarity of this ritual to the Christian sacrament of penance or reconciliation. The Aztecs have a reputation for being bloodthirsty, which is well grounded in terms of some of their ritual practices. In 1503, at the end of one of the great fifty-two-year cycles, thousands of people were sacrificed in one day in Mexico City in order to assure that the calendar continued into the next cycle. Certainly some of the punishments meted out by Aztec society were severe, but this was not wanton violence. The Aztecs had an extremely orderly society with a tremendous social pressure toward conformity. Nonconformity was dealt with quite strictly.\n\nInca Thousands of miles to the south, the Inca empire developed independently from the Maya and the Aztecs. The Inca came to occupy an area that stretched from modern day Ecuador south into what is modern-day Chile, concentrated in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia. Like the Aztecs, the Incas were also latecomers. Inca civilization arose in the early fourteenth century. The Inca specifically were a group of Quechua-speaking people with origins from near Lake Titicaca in the Andean highlands on the border of modern Peru and Bolivia. The Inca creation stories exist in many variants. The common themes of the legends begin with a supreme deity, Viracocha, who created the primordial Inca ancestor, Manco Capac. Manco emerged on the earth accompanied by his wife Mama Ocllo. Manco Capac defeated the existing powers of the earth, who then became stone outcroppings, important religious objects venerated by the Inca. Manco was followed by a line of heirs who constituted the royal dynasty. Many argue that at least the first seven of the rulers and their consorts, in the Incan ruling line, were mythical and not historical.\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 27\n\nViracocha was one of three central deities worshipped by the Inca. He was a creator being who brought forth the heavens and the earth and created men. Worship of Inti, the sun, was a central feature of Inca religion. Inca rulers claimed a genealogical tie to the sun, who then imbued their reign with divine power. Inti was the tribal god of the Inca people, whom he favored by granting them success in war and protection of their empire. The last of the three central deities was Inti-Illapa, the god of thunder. He controlled the weather and many of the forces of nature. Along with Viracocha and Inti, he was worshipped in the most sacred temple of Cuzco, the Coricancha. The Incas also venerated the goddess of Earth, Pachamama, and the goddess of the sea and lakes, Mamacocha. The Inca believed that the emperor was a kinsman of Viracocha and consequently was considered divine. A complex ritual surrounded the person of the emperor precisely to avoid chance contact between the emperor and common people. The bodies of former rulers were mummified, kept in bundles in the Coricancha, and were routinely removed to participate in important ceremonies. The Inca were also keen observers of the passage of time. They used a combination of an annual lunar calendar and a solar calendar. These two calendars do not coincide easily; since the lunar cycle is slightly less than thirty days, it does not divide evenly into 365. The Inca made ad hoc adjustments continually to both calendars to keep them from falling into error. Many sites in the Inca empire were aligned with special celestial events: equinoxes, solstices, rising and setting of specific stars and constellations. These celestial cycles supplemented the basic annual calendars to provide additional accuracy. The Inca had two major religious celebrations each year, the Capac Raymi and the Inti Raymi. The greater of these, the Inti Raymi, occurred with the June solstice, the equivalent of the midwinter solstice for the Southern Hemisphere, and celebrated the sun. The Capac Raymi corresponded to the December solstice, and was dedicated also to the sun and celebrated the passage of boys into manhood. These celebrations struck a chord with the Spaniards who celebrated Christmas near the December solstice and Saint John the Baptist near the June solstice. The Inca landscape, both physical and spiritual, was dotted with sacred spots, generically called huacas. The points where major historic individuals emerged, such as where Manco Capac emerged from the earth, were huacas. Spots where the Inca believed a transcendent power was at work were huacas. The whole of nature was felt to be divine, and local landmarks held divine power and thus were huacas. Passersby would deposit a small stone 28 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nor some other offering to honor these spots. The maintenance of the rituals associated with these divine places occupied a major part of the daily ceremonial life of many individuals. The huacas were in turn linked to one another and to the capital Cuzco. Invisible lines, called ceques, radiated out from the Corichancha in Cuzco to link the hundreds of huacas in its immediate hinterland. Most towns had scores, if not hundreds, of huacas linked to their own town center through the ceque lines. Spaniards working in the sixteenth century documented nearly four hundred huacas associated just with Cuzco in the immediate hinterland of the city. The Spaniards, when they arrived, had great difficulty understanding this ritual and mythical environment. The Inca civilization was able to control a wide range of ecological zones to provide a stable agricultural basis for their civilization. Most cities and towns had territories in the highlands, the temperate mid-zones, and the coastal valleys. The highlands produced a wide variety of foods, the most important of which was the potato. In the temperate zones corn production was possible. In the coastal lowlands many vegetables were grown, and the ocean provided a rich variety of fish and seafood. It was only by controlling all of these regions that native peoples could secure a fairly dependable source of food. If there were unseasonable freezes or other crop destruction in the highlands, a civilization depending solely on potatoes would suffer badly. Likewise, a civilization tied to the ecology of the mid-zones would suffer if for some reason the corn crop failed. If strange currents and abnormal weather along the coast devastated the lowlands, a coastal civilization would be challenged to survive. However, since the Inca civilization controlled all of the ecological zones, its survival potential increased greatly. Once established in Cuzco, the Inca captured the highland valleys toward Lake Titicaca. After that they conquered down to the coast. With these actions they quickly controlled all of the necessary ecological zones. The empire then expanded northward and southward, following each of the ecological zones. The Inca empire was known as Tawantinsuyu, the four districts. Each district, roughly oriented toward the four cardinal directions like segments of a circle with the center in Cuzco, contained some of the three ecological zones, with the eastern district containing jungle lowlands rather than coastal lowlands. Collasuyu stretched south toward Lake Titicaca and beyond into Chile and Bolivia. Cuntisuyu passed to the south and west of Cuzco toward the coast. Antisuyu was all of the empire to the east and north of Cuzco. Chinchasuyu stretched to the north and west along the coast and middle zone into Ecuador.\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 29\n\nThe empire was ruled centrally from Cuzco by an emperor whose title was Capac Apu Sapa Inca. It was from this title that the name was taken and was applied to both the people and the empire. The people were known as the Hatun Runa. Linguistically they are known as Quechua speakers, since Quechua was the official language of the empire, but there were other linguistic and ethnic groups within the empire. One of the most important was the Aymara, who also came from the Lake Titicaca region. The expansion of the Inca empire occurred during the last century prior to the arrival of the Spanish and was brought about through warfare. Once conquered, however, the defeated territories needed to be incorporated into the empire. Each of the four suyus or districts was ruled by a relative of the Sapa Inca, called a capac apu. In turn, the suyus were further subdivided into provinces, the governorship of which was also restricted to kinsmen of the Inca. Since the empire eventually came to consist of many different local ethnic groups, one means of maintaining control over the local regions was to spiritually conquer them. Once conquered, the local religious items, mummy bundles, and huacas of various types, were taken for storage in Cuzco, while religious objects associated with the Inca religion were installed in the newly conquered territory. One of the striking features of the Inca empire was the high degree of centralization. Through an extensive system of roads, wayside inns, and couriers, information, men, and materiel circulated through the empire. To support the widely flung army and the institutions of government, all Incas were required to provide labor service on lands dedicated to the emperor and to the official religious cult. The produce of these plots, along with tribute and other income, was stored in imperial warehouses, collcas, for use by the army or in case of disaster. If a crop failure should occur in some part of the empire, food could be found locally stored or transported from nearby regions, to lessen the disaster. To keep track of these supplies, and to merely keep tabs on the empire, the Inca developed a system of record keeping using knotted strings, quipu. The patterns of strings, knots, and colors served as mnemonic devices for the record keepers and merely assisted the memory but were not true writing systems. Consequently, once the keeper of the quipu died, the information contained in the quipu also passed away unless he had trained a successor. When they Spaniards arrived, they perceived some aspects of native beliefs seemed to be similar to Christianity. Among the Inca there was a custom of cloistering women for the service of the cult of the sun and to serve the Inca emperor as servants within his household. These women, known 30 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nas acllacuna, or chosen women, bore a vague resemblance to nuns of late medieval Europe. The Inca also had a tradition of oracles, the most famous of which was the oracle of Pachacamac, near modern Lima, and these oracles reminded the Spaniards of the ancient Greek and Roman traditions. While the sedentary, highly organized civilizations of the Maya, Aztec, Inca, and others accounted for the majority of the native peoples of the New World at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, there were hundreds, if not thousands, of smaller groups manifesting various types of cultural development. Certainly one of the most common cultural group was that of the hunters and gatherers, which practiced primitive agriculture. These peoples could be found in all areas, and each had unique religious beliefs. Because each group might number only a few thousand persons, they represented some major problems for the Spanish missionaries.\n\nGuaycuruans and other Tribal-level Groups As an example of these tribal-level people in South America, the natives of the Gran Chaco in what is now Paraguay and Bolivia were collectively known as the Guaycuruan. The various tribes within this group were dedicated to hunting and gathering, and shared many cultural traits. While they shared similar languages, they did not have common political organizations. Their loyalty fell completely to their immediate group and not to a larger pan-tribal unit. The Guaycuruans believed in a spiritual creator, who created the world and provided for moral and spiritual guidance. This god was seen as a benefactor to people, especially giving prowess in hunting and war. The sky was inhabited by spirits who could act upon people’s lives—mostly for ill. Similarly there were scores of malevolent terrestrial spirits with which people had to contend. Active intercession with the spirits could neutralize their effect or even use the spirits for good. The Guaycuruans embraced hunting and militarism. They believed that they had to fight for their hunting lands against all challengers. Like the Maya, they divided the world into the heavenly regions, the surface of the earth, and the subterranean world. While in ages past these realms were linked, by a tree in many legends, the tree was destroyed. The various spirits and supernatural powers demanded that the Guaycuruans maintain a balance with their natural environment. Consequently, hunting was deeply imbued with spiritual values simply because there was a reciprocal relationship between animals and humans. Human souls, at death, became part of animal’s bodies; the animals sacrificed themselves for the benefit of human\n\nReligious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America | 31\n\nkind. Yet upon death, the animal spirits could be very dangerous to humans. Because of this, hunters limited themselves to only what they needed. Alcohol played an important ceremonial role, especially to ward off illness and as part of funerary practices. The Guaycuruans had priests, or shamans, who were religious specialists. The shamans controlled, or mediated, the spirit world in which the people lived. The Spaniards, upon their arrival and eventual conquest of the native groups, confronted two great obstacles. One the one hand, the religions and cultures that they encountered were very different from those with which they had some familiarity in the European context. While they might see minor rituals and beliefs, which the native peoples had in common with the Europeans, such as forms of confession or beliefs in a worldwide flood. Yet by and large the native religions were a mystery to the Spanish. On the other hand, they had great difficulty explaining Christianity and European cultural values to the native people of the Americas. The language barrier was only a partial impediment. The Europeans conceived of themselves, the natives, and of nature in a completely different manner from the Native Americans. While they might be able to translate the words, the concepts and the thought processes that lay behind them were totally different. The process of ongoing dialogue between the natives and the Europeans led Christianity in the Americas to develop in a unique way.\n\n32 | Religious Origins of Catholicism in Latin America\n\nSpain and Portugal in the New World\n\n2\n\nOn the deck of the Santa María a crewman rang the bell to mark the hour. Christopher Columbus and his crew paused momentarily from their labors, and each said a prayer to the Virgin Mary to protect them in their voyage. While the small expedition consisted of scores of men, nowhere was there a clergyman. Nonetheless, Columbus and his crew believed that their voyage needed not just divine protection but was part of a larger divine project to spread the Word of God. If the history of Christianity in the New World begins with the voyage of Columbus, Columbus’s voyage begins several decades earlier, as the Portuguese initiated explorations in the Atlantic far beyond the confines of Europe. Portugal completed the Reconquest in their territories by the thirteenth century and remained largely free of conflict for several centuries. From the thirteenth century on, various Portuguese monarchs conceived of expanding the Reconquest by capturing Muslim strongholds on the African side of the Straits of Gibraltar, concluding in 1415 when they captured Ceuta in North Africa. The Portuguese realized that the Muslims of North Africa were merely the farthest outpost of a vast political and economic network. Many of the goods, particularly gold, that the Portuguese and other European powers sought passed through Muslim traders. West Africa was a major producer of gold during the Middle Ages, which came from deposits in sub-Saharan Africa, and was traded northwards, across the Sahara, and eventually into Europe. Other goods, such as silks and spices, were produced in the Far East and passed through a series of merchant networks until they entered the Muslim world and then into Europe. The Portuguese reasoned that if they could reach the source of supply, they could eliminate the Muslim merchants and gain direct access to African gold and Asian trade goods. The Portuguese also continued the Reconquest in a more dramatic way, sending mis\n\n| 33\n\nsionaries to gain converts to Christianity and thereby undermine Muslim rule. And, the Portuguese sought to find the Christian kingdom legend held to be located somewhere to the east, so that they might create an alliance that would in effect surround the Muslims. The Portuguese maritime explorations began in 1419. During the next eighty years, the Portuguese would systematically sail the North Atlantic and the Atlantic coast of Africa. The Portuguese voyages of exploration fall into two basic periods. The first consisted of voyages in the North Atlantic. In the first twenty years of exploration, the Portuguese discovered and began to settle on many of the small islands of the North Atlantic, including Porto Santo (1418), Madeira (1419), the Azores (1427), and the Canaries (ca. 1431). The Portuguese sailors had determined that the winds and currents of the North Atlantic followed a generally clockwise flow, with the southern boundary being immediately north of the equator in what is now called the inter-tropical convergence zone. The second phase of the Portuguese explorations overlapped slightly with the first, but consisted of voyages down the west coast of Africa. By 1434 the Portuguese had reached Cape Bojador, Cape Verde by 1444, and by 1460 the coast of Sierra Leone. The method pursued by these voyages was to sail as far down the coast as possible. Voyages to the region between Cape Bojador and Cape Verde required a return voyage that went west far out into the Atlantic, since the prevailing winds and currents went south and west. The Portuguese knowledge of the islands of Madeira and the Azores provided them with fuel and water stops for the return voyage. Once the expeditions had passed Cape Verde, the direction of the winds and currents shifted. In the inter-tropical convergence zone the winds and currents predominately go from east to west, but south of there the winds come up from the southeast. Sailing beyond this point required them to abandon the use of the square-rigged ship (não in Portuguese), which required wind from behind, and to adopt the caravel, which relied on triangular, or lateen, sails, allowing it to sail much closer to the wind. In order to return from the region south of Cape Verde, the expeditions sailed significantly westward and caught the northward winds and currents, stopping for supplies on one of the mid-Atlantic islands and then eastward to Portugal. These voyages had important financial and political implications. They sought to discover the source of African gold and possibly divert its flow from Muslim traders of the Sahara. They also wanted to establish political ties with whatever powers controlled those regions. But their third impetus was to Christianize the peoples of the regions they discovered in order to 34 | Spain and Portugal in the New World\n\ncreate allies in a worldwide confrontation with the Muslims. In keeping with this third goal, the Portuguese asked for and received papal support for their efforts. In a series of papal decrees, or bulls,1 between 1452 and 1456, Nicholas V and Callistus II granted certain rights and privileges to the Portuguese crown. The pope allowed the Portuguese to attack and conquer any Muslims, pagans, or heathens who opposed the Christian word and to take both the goods and lands of these opponents, making slaves of them and granting t"
