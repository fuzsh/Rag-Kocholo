Not unlike the ships that implemented the slave trade and facilitated colonial incursions into Africa from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, La Méduse set sail to Senegal with a retinue of French administrators and colonists sent to reestablish French control in the region. Shonibare, a British/Nigerian contemporary artist, presents a multi-level engagement with the history behind both the incident and its most famous visual incarnation—Théodore Géricault’s epic painting The Raft of the Medusa (1918) (Figure 3.1). Shonibare sets his sights on European colonialism vis-à-..."
