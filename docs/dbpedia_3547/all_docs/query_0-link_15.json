        "text": "The integration of the research on different eras and regions carried out in the Departments and Research Groups is of great importance to the Institute. Different formats as well as interdepartmental research projects and co-operations enable intensive exchange among researchers and visiting scholars.\n\nEvents\n\nVarious joint events provide the opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange between all researchers across departmental boundaries on a regular basis. After the corona-related break in spring and summer 2021, we have been able to resume most of the joint events using online formats and continue the interdepartmental debate on fundamental research questions in legal history and legal theory.\n\nWithin the context of the monthly Plenum, all of the researchers have the opportunity to discuss their research projects, common issues and findings. The mpilhlt’s monthly Colloquium is intended as a forum for all researchers at the Institute to discuss conceptual questions, methods and current debates in legal history. It provides a space for mutual exchange and the cross-fertilisation of ideas across departmental boundaries, but also serves as an opportunity for researchers to identify their own position within disciplinary and wider scholarly trends and debates. Finally, one of its key purposes is the development of a common frame of reference for discussions among the researchers of the Institute.\n\nTwice per semester, the Institute hosts, together with colleagues from the Institut für Rechtsgeschichte at the Goethe-Universität, the Frankfurter Rechtshistorische Abendgespräche. Since the winter semester of 2014/15, we have taken turns hosting the event, at which a public talk by an external speaker is followed by the opportunity for conversation and exchange between researchers from the two institutes.\n\nIn May 2018 and 2019 all researchers took the time to go together on a retreat. The two-day stays in a conference hotel in the Spessart offered a particularly comfortable and intensive working atmosphere in which previous work was reflected on and the further development of the Institute’s research agenda discussed.\n\nSummer Academy for Legal History\n\nA highlight each year in the Institute’s academic life is the Summer Academy for Legal History. Its aim is to provide roughly 20 early-stage researchers from all over the world, usually PhD students, with an in-depth introduction to basic approaches and methods of research in legal history. Unfortunately, the Summer Academy had to be cancelled due to the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe Summer Academy aims to develop and enhance the ability of its participants to transfer legal terminologies and theories across linguistic and cultural contexts, thus providing a basis to build and consolidate international research networks. The 14-day course consists of three parts. The first part introduces the international group of PhD students to sources and methodological approaches as well as theoretical models and controversial research debates on fundamental research fields of legal history. The introductory courses are led by members of the Institute and invited guest speakers.\n\nIn the second part, the invited participants present their own projects within the context of the respective year’s special topic. The third part of the Academy offers all participants the opportunity to further develop their own research by making use of the library and by discussing their projects with the Institute’s experts in the different fields of legal history.\n\nSince longer events like the Academy always consist of more than just academic activities, a variety of extra-curricular activities are offered, such as visits to nearby historical sites and several get-togethers in the evenings. The Academy concludes with an examination and the award of certificates.\n\nSummer Academy for Legal History 2018: The World and the Village\n\nThe Global and the Local in Legal History\n\n16.07.– 27.07.2018\n\nAs an academic discipline, legal history emerged both in Europe and several other regions in the 19th and early 20th centuries: the age of the nation-state. Research in legal history that focuses on local and regional contexts — Europe, for example — is largely a product of this heritage. Global history, historiographic reflection and new methods in the humanities have helped to bring the complexity of local, national, regional and global relationships into the purview of legal history. Moreover, the increasing importance of supranational and transnational law make it all the more urgent from the perspective of legal studies to consider the relation between world and village.\n\nProgramme\n\nLectures\n\nStefan Vogenauer, The Max Planck Society and the Max Planck Institute for European Legal History\n\nThomas Duve, The global and the local in legal history Christian Baldus, Roman law / antiquity\n\nChristiane Birr, Ius commune – legists\n\nThomas Duve, Legal history between law, history and theory Christoph Meyer, Ius Commune – canonists\n\nStefan Vogenauer, Common law Christiane Birr, Private law I Phillip Hellwege, Private law II\n\nAndreas Thier, Time, law, and legal history – some observations and considerations (evening lecture)\n\nThorsten Keiser, Contemporary legal history Otto Danwerth, Legal history of Ibero-America Karl Härter, History of criminal law\n\nDonal Coffey, Legal transfer in the common law world Alexandra Kemmerer, International law\n\nSigfrido Ramirez Perez, EU law and oral history\n\nAndreas Wagner, Digital humanities in legal history\n\nPresentations of participants\n\nAlex Corona Encinas, The concept of municipium in the Corpus iuris civilis and its relationship with Roman classical law\n\nOrit Malka, The role of witnesses in antiquity: Tannaitic law as a test case\n\nAna Luiza Ferreira, The sources of colonial law and the Portuguese Inquisition in the Captaincy of Ceará (Brazil)\n\nAlexis Alvarez-Nakagawa, Cannibal laws: the origins of international law and the juridical forms of the conquest (16th–18th centuries)\n\nKonstanze von Schütz, Universal(ist) conceptions of property and diverging sets of property rights: German law, French law and the common law tradition\n\nManon Moerman, What’s in a name?

Obviously, they cannot be understood without their respective historical contexts. In recent decades, however, there has been a growing awareness that they must also be read with specific attention to their mediality and their interrelation with visual and oral sources, as well as objects and artefacts. Historians, but also legal theorists, are reflecting more intensively about textuality and normativity, and digital humanities seems to hold great opportunities for legal historical research. What do these developments mean for legal historical research, and its specific task?\n\nProgramme\n\nLectures\n\nThomas Duve, The Max Planck Society and the Max Planck Institute for European Legal History Constantin Willems, Roman law / antiquity\n\nManuela Bragagnolo, Introduction law in text and context Christiane Birr, Ius commune – legists\n\nChristoph Meyer, Ius commune – canonists\n\nThomas Duve, Legal history between law, history and theory Thomas Duve, Global legal history\n\nVictoria Barnes, Common law\n\nPeter Collin, Special orders and normative diversity Alexandra Kemmerer, International law\n\nThomas Duve, Mariana Dias Paes, Manuel Bastias Saavedra, Li Fupeng, Glocalising normativities Donal Coffey, Legal transfer in the common law world\n\nJohannes Liebrecht, Private law and constitutional law in the 20th century: the German example Thorsten Keiser, Contemporary legal history\n\nJan-Henrik Meyer, History of European Union law\n\nAndreas Wagner, Anselm Küsters, Digital humanities in legal history Marietta Auer, Legal theory\n\nPresentations of participants\n\nBrage Thunestvedt Hatløy, Developments in the field of commercial law and law of obligations in the Norwegian Middle Ages\n\nGijs Drijer, Maritime averages and normative practice in the Southern Low Countries (15th–16th centuries)\n\nMayer Juni, ‘Tell us the story of your life’: inquisition, biography, and power in the Spanish Empire\n\nRômulo da Silva Ehalt, Casuistry in the tropics: moral theology and missionary pragmatics in Portuguese Asia (16th–17th centuries)\n\nDavid De Concilio, The development of legal texts in late twelfth-century England and Italy\n\nKate Falconer, The common law right to possession of the body of the deceased: a proposed history\n\nZheng Chi, The development of judicial independence in the Late Qing dynasty and the Republic of China (1906–1949)\n\nThinley Wangmo Chinaiwengmu, History of Tibetan Buddhist religious property\n\nNinja Bumann, Marriages before Sharia courts: marriage and gender in legal culture and practice in Habsburg Bosnia-Herzegovina (1878–1918)\n\nNechama Juni, Laws, norms, and subjects: twentieth century Jewish Responsa and the worlds they create\n\nMarjorie Carvalho de Souza, Free and freed labourers ‘in witness whereof’: the service rental contracts as employment arrangements in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro (1830–1888)\n\nLia Brazil, International law and the rule of law: white colonies in the British Empire (1899–1919)\n\nElena Kempf, Humanitarian calculus: the making and meaning of weapons prohibitions in International law (1868–1925)\n\nMatthew Birchall, Law, empire, and the future of global history\n\nTashi Palzor Lepcha, Implementation crisis of pre-merger laws of Sikkim protected under article 371 F of the Indian Constitution: a critical analysis\n\nAna Lena Werner, Justice and the National Socialist past: democracy and the aftermath of dictatorship in the Bavarian Ministry of Justice (1945–1974)\n\nBalaban Shlomi, The rise of the professional member of the Knesset\n\nRolando Víctor Guerrero, Scholastics and classicists: circulation of the legal thought in the south of Colombia between 1900 and 1930\n\nJingzhao Fan, Foreign direct investment: a comparative legal study in the UK, Russia and China\n\nLegal Histography\n\nShared Research Field\n\nEvery academic discipline profits from reflection on its own doings. This entails keeping up with the development of the academic system and, in the case of jurisprudence, of the legal system of which it is a part. Jurists must reflect on the history of their discipline and on the history of their research objects to build on existing analytical traditions, to identify and, if necessary, to overcome path dependencies. If a reflection on legal history is an essential component of each sub-discipline of jurisprudence, then legal history must also continuously and critically re-evaluate the foundations of its own work. The dynamic changes associated with the transnationalisation of law and academic research serve only to reinforce this imperative. The Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory has taken on the task of encouraging such reflection on the goals and methods of legal history through academic events and publications on these questions. Among other efforts, the Max Planck Summer Academy for Legal History as well as the book series methodica – Einführungen in die rechtshistorische Forschung (Introductions to the Methods of Legal History), which is managed by the Institute’s own researchers, serve this purpose. Another important shared interest is the reflection on legal historical methods and the history of the field. The Institute is also taking part in the research project History of the Max Planck Society post 1945 (see Kunstreich) and sees it as its task to shape the international discussion on the past and future of legal history.\n\nHeinz Mohnhaupt\n\nAffiliate Researcher\n\nLegal Historiography\n\nComparative law as a method of knowledge\n\nTerritorial sovereignty and legal sources of all European countries\n\nComparative law as a method of knowledge\n\nThe abolition and dissolution of law\n\nWithin the reporting period, several ongoing publication projects were successfully brought to a conclusion. One of the more noteworthy achievements is the completion of the volume Territorialhoheit und Rechtsquellen aller europäischen Territorien im 16. – 18. Jahrhundert (Territorial sovereignty and legal sources of all European countries in the 16th to 18th centuries), which is ready for printing. Originally intended for Coing’s Handbuch, this presentation of the ‘constitutional’ conditions for the production and development of statutory and judicial legal sources has far extended the originally envisioned framework.\n\nThe conceptual specification of the various legal sources possessing the status of law includes all normative acts from the lex generalis to the privilegium and the received Roman legal forms (decree, edict, mandate etc) to the comprehensive codification as well as the normatively operative res iudicata and the opinio communis. This legal pluralism gives rise to the question of how to determine the rank and relationship between the various legal sources. With the editorial process for the texts on Sweden, Scotland and Italy recently concluded, all 16 European contributions are now complete and will be published as a monograph (930 pages) in the Institute’s publication series.\n\nAnother important contribution is the completion of the work on the volume Privilegien als Sonderrecht in der europäischen Rechtsgeschichte (The system of privileges in all European countries). Legislation, both in form and content, follows the ideal of equality as lex generalis. The privilegium, on the other hand, individualises law for specific persons (privilegium speciale) and for definable groups of persons (privilegium generale); or particularises law for local and regional areas (privilegium particulare). Following the Roman legal model, privileges are counted under the genus of iura singularia. According to this provision, the individualisation of law via privilege is seen as an ideal of justice, one which in the Age of Enlightenment collides with the just demand for equality. The excessive granting of privilege in lawless spaces can take over the function of laws (copyright, commercial law, inventor’s law). The text is now finished and covers theory and practice of all European countries. The sources referenced are arranged by territory, and the literature is arranged according to subject matter. This volume (950 pages) will also appear in the Institute’s series of publications.\n\nRounding out the publication projects is the Rechtsvergleichung als Erkenntnismethode. Historische Perspektiven des Vergleichens vom Spätmittelalter bis ins 19. Jahrhundert (Comparative law as a method of knowledge concerning historical perspectives from the Middle Ages to the 19th century). This volume brings together ten essays by the author on the history of comparison as a method in philosophy, ius privatum and ius publicum. Rechtsvergleichung, used in examining different states and legal systems in order to determine the best legal solutions, benefited from earlier comparative approaches in non-legal disciplines (such as medicine, theology, linguistics as well as art history and cultural history), which are also examined in this book. The volume is due to appear in one of the mpilhlt publication series.\n\nFinally, the collection of materials for the research project on Abschaffung und Untergang von Recht (The abolition and dissolution of law) is finished. In contrast to the numerous studies examining the emergence or production of new law, this research focuses on law that has lost its legal force, that is, has lapsed out of use (desuetudo), become outdated or has been abolished by legislators and judges. By examining the reversal of the production of law, this project addresses an often overlooked dimension of legal history.\n\nVisitors' Programme\n\nIn 2018 and 2019 we invited a number of PhD students, postdoctoral and senior scholars to visit the Institute in order to use our library resources, take part in our events, and above all to discuss current questions of legal history with us. The mpilhlt awards a number of scholarships each year in order to enable researchers from institutions outside Germany to benefit from a longer stay at the Institute. Due to the measures necessary to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, we were forced to postpone or cancel the planned research stays from March 2020 on and could not accept any further applications for scholarships in 2021. However, we are confident to resume the Visitors’ Programme in 2022.\n\nThe overriding goal of the Visitors’ Programme is to foster transnational networks of scholars and thereby contribute to a more transnational jurisprudence. The visiting scholars form a crucial part in Institute’s interdisciplinary exchange and contribute significantly to the internationalisation of the research agenda. All visitors – from PhD students to senior scholars – are invited to actively take part in the Institute’s activities. Depending on the duration of the stay, this includes presenting their research projects in the Institute’s ‘Current research in legal history’ workshop series.\n\nVisitors at the Institute\n\nArgentina\n\n2018\n\nOsvaldo Barreneche (Universidad Nacional de La Plata), The Legal and Political History of Buenos Aires Police Province, Argentina, during the 20th century\n\nMelisa Andrea Fernández Marrón (Universidad Nacional de La Pampa, Santa Rosa / Universidad Nacional de Río Negro, Viedma), Discipline the police force.

Various venues for promoting digital resources, computational methods and workflows, and data literacy principles have been established; this has clearly encouraged researchers to seek guidance and support with regard to their research questions and methodological ideas. While researchers have thus acquired specialised as well as basic ‘digital competencies’ (like using the command line, data cleaning, version control systems, citing data and software), their concrete needs had in many cases not been anticipated and the process has involved a broadening of the competencies available in-house as well. On the other hand, longerstanding projects and the need for legacy data migration have induced a deepening of methods in the sense of a permanent effort to reconcile bespoke solutions with generic approaches and sustainability requirements (for example developing microservices and an infrastructure-as-code approach). In the following, the Digital Humanities activities at the Institute are described by focusing on some approaches that are driven by, and affect, a number of individual research projects. Some of these areas have been a constant in Digital Humanities activities from the outset, whereas others have just started to evolve.\n\nDigital editing\n\nVarious projects are preparing their textual material in a way that will result in a digital scholarly edition of the source text(s). This involves discussion and decision of different methods of text acquisition, editorial markup, correction and enhancement, and publication. Whereas the School of Salamanca project, for instance, uses a mix of manual transcription and automatic text recognition from images (OCR), the more recent Non-state law of the economy project uses OCR exclusively. We have evaluated various software solutions for this task and have presented a viable approach to the Institute’s researchers in a workshop. The results in the Non-state law project are encouraging and we plan to make this method of text acquisition available to more researchers. In addition, different strategies in the editorial process must be pursued: the Non-state law project can easily forego some of the layout information from its original sources in favour of a more explicit tagging of norms and regulatory matters, which will be made accessible in a database-like interface. The Hyperazpilcueta project puts more emphasis on the preparation of comparable texts and the establishment (and presentation) of alignment information; it is thus most interested in expanding abbreviations to identical forms and in making the names of the authors comparable. In such ways, the scholarly aim of the final publication both determines the functionality the digital edition should offer and directs the focus of the editorial efforts. At the same time, we can make sure that no information is lost by preserving digital images and explicitly recording editorial interventions. For an insight into such considerations, the editorial guidelines of the Salamanca project (at https://www.salamanca.school/en/guidelines.html) may serve as an example.\n\nText analysis\n\nOne of the obvious advantages of having historical legal text available in digital form is the possibility to perform algorithmic analyses on it, independently of the amount of text. In fact, some ways of looking at texts make sense only if there is a larger basis of text to look at. Simple approaches use statistical methods to make assertions about a collection of texts, about single words, or possibly concepts, occurring in such collections. An example of this can be seen in the review of the two Oxford Handbooks on Legal History that has developed out of discussions in the Institute’s Interest Group for Digital Humanities [Küsters, Volkind, Wagner, Digital Humanities and the State of Legal History, 2019]. For legal history in general, the analysis of the relation between specific texts is often of particular interest, as evidenced by projects undertaken by Manuela Bragagnolo, Donal Coffey, or Anselm Küsters. Küsters, for instance, investigates the adherence of a journal to distinct strands of thought in a given time period. Bragagnolo assesses the similarity of text passages across languages (in different reworked editions of a 16th-century text) in order to identify correspondences and divergences. The study of Donal Coffey, examining the influence that a series of contemporary and earlier constitutions had on the drafting of the Burmese Constitution of 1948, has been published, along with the digital materials and software that were used to perform the analyses. In the projects mentioned, we have used various Text Reuse Detection and Topic Modelling approaches, and are looking forward to applying Semantic Shift Detection and Citation Network Extraction methods.\n\nGraph data modelling, network analysis and visualisation\n\nFor the study of relations in particular, graph data models have become important facilitators. In the Governance of the Universal Church after the Council of Trent project, data gathered from session protocols of the Congregation of the Council of Trent is recorded in a graph database that allows finding unsuspected and indirect relations, eg between subject matters of the cases, regions where they originated, and advocates involved in their formal initiation. It also allows us to record information about the various uncertainties coming into play in the scribal, archival and contemporary scholarly contexts [Wagner, Ambiguität und Unsicherheit: drei Ebenen eines Datenmodells, 2019]. As the project proceeds, we expect to apply network analysis methods to identify cliques and gather information about the density of relations and the centrality / marginality of certain persons. However, such graphs frequently come with a complexity issue: while a network seems to suggest an intuitive visualisation, if you present all the information that is available in such a graph database, the result is so dense that you cannot anything make out (the technical term is a ‘hairball’). Thus, researchers also have to think about abstracting and extracting just one aspect or component of the whole network (a ‘projection’), or about how best to organise the layout of the network visualisation. For instance, in his dissertation Fupeng Li has used a ‘hierarchical edge bundling’ approach to visualising the network of citations in the two drafts of the Chinese constitution from 1923 and 1936. Again, the relevant materials and code have been published under an open licence [Wagner, Li, Citation Network Visualisation of two Drafts (1923 and 1936) of the Chinese Constitution, 2020].\n\nOutlook and conclusion\n\nTwo tendencies may consolidate in the next years from activities that have recently been initiated. On the one hand, the semantic dimension of texts, in particular the aspects that play or define legal roles, may come more into focus. From the recognition of persons’ names and their networks, both by now well-established approaches in general digital historical research, our interest is likely to also move on to the recognition of legal roles, facts and arguments, requiring innovations in the areas of both language processing and data modelling. On the other hand, projects by Sigfrido Ramírez and Karla Escobar are extending the digital methods and resources in use at the Institute beyond written text to cover oral history. We are going to acquire competencies of datafication, storage and publication of audio or video recordings, and to develop new approaches to confront them with legal historical questions. We are very confident that the innovative use of digital methods in the Institute’s research will continue to provide original and ground-breaking results in the years to come."
