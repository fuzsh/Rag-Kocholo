Basque and Celtic people belong to this Haplogroup and they were among the earliest settlers of the Iberian Peninsula. 65% of modern day Iberians share this origin. The following markers are common to the people bordering Europe's Atlantic within a couple of steps; DYS19 (DYS394)=14, DYS388=12, DYS390=24, DYS391=11, DYS392=13 and DYS393=13.\n\nAbascal - R1a: Eastern European Origin. The R1a lineage is believed to have originated in the Eurasian Steppes north of the Black & Caspian Seas. This lineage is thought to descend from a population of the Kurgan culture, known for the domestication of the horse (circa 3000 B.C.E.). These people were also believed to be the first speakers of the Indo-European language group. This lineage is found in central & western Asia, India, and in Slavic populations of Europe. Slavonic mercenaries were used by the Moors in the second half of the 9th Century, it is likely this is the origin of haplogroup R1a in Iberia. 2% of modern day Iberians share this origin.\n\nAbrego - R1a: Eastern European Origin.
