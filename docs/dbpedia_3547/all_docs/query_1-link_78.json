June 7, 2009, Houma, Tongatapu, Tonga), prime minister of Tonga (1991-2000); nephew of Salote Tupou III; cousin of Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. He served with the Royal New Zealand Air Force from 1942 to 1945. He entered the civil service in 1945 and was aide-de-camp to Queen Salote Tupou III prior to being appointed governor of Ha'apai (1960-68). From 1969 to 1972, he was Tonga's high commissioner to the U.K.; in 1970 he was appointed baron. He returned home in 1973 to become the first minister of labour, commerce, and industries, and in 1975 was also appointed minister of agriculture and forestry.

Jan. 28, 1906, Theodosia, Ottoman Empire [now Tosya, Turkey] - d. Feb. 22, 1992, Athens, Greece), Greek insurgent. He came to Greece in 1923 in the great population exchange after the unsuccessful Greek campaign against the Turks. He joined the Communist Party (KKE) in 1929 and was imprisoned or sent to internal exile on several occasions for seditious activities, provoking strikes, agitation, and similar charges. He headed ELAS, the armed force of the EAM (National Liberation Front), in western Macedonia during the German occupation in World War II. After the war he rose to commander (under the title General Markos) of the Communist-led Democratic Army, which began a guerrilla campaign against the royalist government in 1946. In December 1947 he proclaimed a provisional Greek government in the north with himself as prime minister, but it was never internationally recognized. Due to the material support received from Yugoslavia, he disagreed with demands from Moscow that the KKE line up against Titoism and was ousted from his command (August 1948) and sent to Albania, though orders were still issued in his name. In 1949 he was officially removed from his posts and sent to Moscow. When U.S.-backed royalist troops crushed the rebels that year, after Tito closed the border, his position seemed to have been justified. He was nevertheless purged from the exiled KKE in 1950. After the Stalinist secretary-general Nikos Zachariadis was himself purged in 1956, Vafiadis was rehabilitated and served on the Politburo (1957-58). He was stripped of his membership again in 1964 but, after a split in 1968, was restored in 1969 to the \"Eurocommunist\" KKE-Interior. He returned to Greece in March 1983 after a general amnesty was declared, and in 1989 and 1990 he was elected to parliament on the ticket of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.\n\nVagapov, Sabir (Akhmedyanovich) (b.

June 10, 1957, Plunge district, Lithuanian S.S.R.), prime minister of Lithuania (1991-92, 1996-99). He first took office in January 1991 amid a bloody Soviet crackdown aimed at crushing the Baltic state's independence movement. He launched market reforms which brought the country to the forefront of emerging European economies. But his rapid privatization program alienated many, and he was a target of criticism as living standards plummeted amid the severe economic depression that followed the Soviet collapse. He lost a general election to the (former Communist) Democratic Labour Party in 1992, and won back the post in a general election in 1996. He resigned in 1999. Pres. Valdas Adamkus had long been critical of Vagnorius's style. In a speech the week before, he said he could no longer trust the premier, citing in particular his handling of a series of privatizations. Parliament countered by approving a non-binding resolution of support for the embattled premier. But Vagnorius said afterwards that he felt it was best to step aside amid \"a situation of senseless political tensions and intrigues.\"\n\nVagov, Aleksey (Vlasovich) (b. 1905 - d. 1971), first secretary of the Communist Party of the Kirgiz S.S.R.

March 19, 1950, Sibiu, Romania), prime minister of Romania (1919-20, 1932, 1933). In 1906 he was elected to the Hungarian parliament, where he was foremost among the leaders of the Transylvanian political movement. In October 1918 he presented a resolution to parliament announcing the Transylvanian Romanians' right to self-determination, and in December, after Hungary's surrender in World War I, he became a member of the Directing Council which administered Transylvania until union with Romania was proclaimed in January 1919. He then became minister for Transylvania in the Romanian cabinet and took part in the post-World War I peace conference at Paris. His National Party was successful in the November elections, and he was named prime minister in a coalition government, also serving as foreign minister. His chief act was negotiation of the union of Bessarabia with Romania, and its recognition by the Allied powers in 1920. He also had Romanian troops intervene in Hungary to oust the Communist regime of Béla Kun. His proposal of a radical land-reform measure prompted King Ferdinand to dissolve his government in March 1920.

Aug. 16, 2018, New Delhi, India), prime minister of India (1996, 1998-2004). Before independence, he was briefly jailed in 1942 for anti-British activities. He was first elected to parliament in 1957 as a member of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, a forerunner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and quickly made a reputation as a keen debater. During Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's state of emergency (1975-77), he was jailed along with thousands of opposition members. As foreign minister (1977-79), he won recognition for trying to improve relations with Pakistan, which India had fought in three wars since 1947. In 1980 he helped found the BJP, in which he stood out as a moderate among hardliners. When Hindu zealots smashed the historic Muslim mosque at Ayodhya in 1992, setting off bloody riots, he was one of the few Hindu leaders to condemn it. The BJP preached Hinduism as India's driving force - a position most Muslims found repugnant - and advocated testing a nuclear weapon and building a nuclear arsenal. He was sworn in as prime minister in 1996 but served only 13 days, failing to win the necessary support from other parties. In 1998 the BJP won a record number of seats but still had to form an alliance with regional parties, many of them opposed to Hindu nationalism. In May 1998 India exploded five nuclear bombs. Though the tests were widely condemned in the West, Vajpayee struck a defiant tone, declaring that \"India has the sanction of her own past glory and future vision to become strong.\" But he also went to great lengths to establish friendly relations with Pakistan, despite periods of serious tension. His National Democratic Alliance coalition won elections again in 1999 but was defeated in 2004.\n\nVakhayev, Ramazan (Visayevich), chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Chechen-Ingush A.S.S.R.

He fought as a guerrilla for the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola against Portuguese rule.

March 17, 2002, Hanoi), Vietnamese general. He joined the Communist Party in 1937. Part of an elite handful of revolutionaries who masterminded Vietnam's war of independence against France, he was named Hanoi's military chief of staff in 1953 and went on to fight against American forces during the Vietnam War. He headed the final Communist offensive against U.S.-backed South Vietnam in the spring of 1975. The war came to an end on April 30 of that year as North Vietnamese tanks rolled through the gates of the presidential palace in Saigon, South Vietnam's capital. His military reputation in Vietnam stands second only to battlefield legend Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, who along with Ho Chi Minh and Pham Van Dong were considered the architects of the nation's Communist revolution. Dung replaced Giap as defense minister in 1980 and was an advocate of a large standing army. Criticized from within the army for his autocratic style and rumours of family corruption, he was replaced in 1987 during a cabinet shuffle.\n\nVan Tigchelt, Paul (b. Nov. 13, 1973, Turnhout, Antwerp province, Belgium), minister of justice and North Sea and a deputy prime minister of Belgium (2023- ).\n\nVan Volxem, Guillaume Hippolyte (b.

He was also minister of the civil service, public enterprise, and institutional reform (2008-09) and a deputy prime minister (2008-13).\n\nC. Vance\n\nVance, Cyrus (Roberts) (b. March 27, 1917, Clarksburg, W.Va. - d. Jan. 12, 2002, New York City), U.S. secretary of state (1977-80). His government career began in 1957 when he served as special counsel to a Senate subcommittee. When John F. Kennedy became president in 1961 he appointed Vance general counsel to the Defense Department where he later became secretary of the Army and deputy secretary of defense, resigning in 1967. Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson sent him as a troubleshooter to investigate Canal Zone riots in Panama in 1964, to the Dominican Republic during the 1965 civil war, and to Detroit to study civil disturbances in 1967. As Jimmy Carter's secretary of state, Vance was a major architect of a foreign policy that produced historic achievements but was widely perceived as muddled and inconsistent. Persistent disagreements reached a climax over the abortive attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran. On April 28, 1980, Vance became only the second secretary of state in U.S. history to resign over a clear policy issue. However, he could point to several historic successes, headed by the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Other foreign policy initiatives, such as the normalization of relations with China, were deeply divisive and pitted Vance against conservatives. In 1991 he became a troubleshooter for the United Nations and negotiated a ceasefire between Serbs and Croats in Croatia that led to the stationing of 15,000 peacekeepers to the newly independent republic. He lobbied unsuccessfully to prevent early recognition of Croatia without first solving political conflicts. He predicted Bosnia would have no choice but to follow because Serbs, angered at being cut off from Yugoslavia, would take up arms. Vance could not later secure peace in Bosnia and he resigned in 1993.\n\nVance, J(ames) D(avid), original name James Donald Bowman, later James David Hamel (b. Aug. 2, 1984, Middletown, Ohio), U.S. politician. He first came to notice as the author of the book Hillbilly Elegy (2016), a sympathetic description of the class of people who were forming the core political base of Donald Trump. Nevertheless, he criticized Trump at the time in no uncertain terms, calling him \"cultural heroin\" and that \"he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place,\" and wondering whether he was merely \"a cynical asshole like Nixon\" or rather \"America's Hitler.\" In the following years, however, he himself went down the far-right rabbit hole and developed essentially anti-democratic views. With Trump's endorsement and $10 million from reactionary billionaire Peter Thiel, he was elected U.S. senator from Ohio in 2022. In 2024 he was picked by Trump as his vice presidential candidate for his third presidential run.\n\nVance, Joseph (b. March 21, 1786, Catfish, near Washington, Pa. - d. Aug. 24, 1852, near Urbana, Ohio), governor of Ohio (1836-38).\n\nVance, Zebulon B(aird) (b. May 13, 1830, near Asheville, N.C. - d. April 14, 1894, Washington, D.C.), governor of North Carolina (1862-65, 1877-79). He was also a U.S. representative (1858-61) and senator (1879-94) from North Carolina.\n\nVande Lanotte, Johan (Cyrille Corneel) (b. July 6, 1955, Poperinge, Belgium), interior minister (1994-98) and a deputy prime minister (1995-98, 1999-2005, 2011-14) of Belgium. He was also minister of civil service (1994-95), budget (1999-2005), social integration and social economy (1999-2003), public enterprises (2003-05), and economy, consumer affairs, and the North Sea (2011-14) and mayor of Ostend (2015-18).\n\nVandekerckhove, Robert (Gérard) (b. June 30, 1917, Ingelmunster, West Flanders, Belgium - d. Feb. 23, 1980, Mechelen, Antwerp, Belgium), Belgian politician. He was minister of institutional reform (1974-77) and chairman of the Senate (1977-80).\n\nVanden Boeynants\n\nVanden Boeynants, Paul (Émile François Henri) (\"VDB\") (b. May 22, 1919, Forest municipality, Brussels, Belgium - d. Jan. 9, 2001, Aalst, Belgium), Belgian politician. He developed an interest in politics and entered parliament in 1949. As Brussels alderman for city properties, he oversaw the drastic renewal of the stylish capital. Whole neighborhoods were razed to make way for drab modernist blocks, giving Brussels a reputation for destructive city renewal. Vanden Boeynants became the bane of preservationists and environmentalists, and allegations were rife that his friends in the construction industry profited from his decisions. In 1958-61 he was minister for the middle classes. He used his dealmaking skills to dominate Belgian politics for much of the 1960s and 1970s. He was prime minister in 1966-68 and 1978-79, both periods when tension peaked between Belgium's Dutch-speakers and Francophones. The Christian Democrat held brittle coalitions together by postponing and sidestepping divisive political issues. He was defense minister in 1972-79 and held his parliament seat until 1985. He remained a champion and a symbol for the small businessman. But his stature took a crippling blow in 1986 when he was convicted of tax fraud in connection with his business activities and given a three-year suspended sentence, with the judge calling him an \"inveterate swindler.\" He later tried to become mayor of Brussels, but despite widespread support in the 1988 municipal polls, was told by the government his fraud conviction made him unfit for office. The feisty politician was abducted in 1989 for a month and released only after his family paid a hefty ransom. He was a great advocate of Belgian unity and was perhaps the last truly \"Belgian\" politician.\n\nVandenberg, Charles Alexis (b. Jan. 20, 1858, Antibes, Alpes-Maritimes, France - d. 1942), governor of Lebanon (1924-25).\n\nH.S. Vandenberg\n\nVandenberg, Hoyt S(anford) (b. Jan. 24, 1899, Milwaukee, Wis. - d. April 2, 1954, Washington, D.C.), U.S. director of central intelligence (1946-47). He was graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 1923 and from the Air Service Flying School and its Advanced Flying School in 1924. After several years of flight training and teaching, he entered the Air Corps Tactical School in 1934, and the Command and General Staff School in 1935. He taught at the Air Corps Tactical School from 1936 to 1938, when he entered the Army War College. Early in 1942 he was operations and training officer of the air staff in Washington, D.C. Later that year he helped organize the U.S. air forces in North Africa, becoming chief of staff of the 12th air force, and later of the northwest African strategic air force. In August 1943 he became deputy chief of staff at air force headquarters and headed an air mission to the U.S.S.R. In April 1944 he was designated deputy commander in chief of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force and commander of its U.S. air component, assuming command of the 9th air force in August. His postwar positions included assistant chief of air staff (1945); director of intelligence on the War Department general staff (January-June 1946); director of what was then the Central Intelligence Group (1946-47); deputy commander and chief of air staff of the army air forces (June 1947); air force vice chief of staff with the rank of general (Oct. 1, 1947); and chief of staff of the U.S. air force (April 30, 1948). After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 he presided over the Air Force buildup for the war and took part in the decision to invade Inch'on in September 1950 and the decision to remove Gen. Douglas MacArthur from command in the spring of 1951. He retired in 1953.\n\nF. Vandenbroucke\n\nG. Vandenbroucke\n\nVandenbroucke, Frank (Ignace Georgette) (b. Oct. 21, 1955, Louvain, Belgium), foreign minister of Belgium (1994-95). He has also been a deputy prime minister (1994-95, 2020- ) and minister of social affairs and pensions (1999-2003) and employment and pensions (2003-04).\n\nVandenbroucke, Gérard (b. Jan. 29, 1948, Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France - d. Feb. 14, 2019, Limoges), president of the Regional Council of Limousin (2014-15).\n\nVandenpeereboom, Alphonse (Louis François Xavier) (b. June 7, 1812, Ypres, France [now in Belgium] - d. Oct. 10, 1884, Saint-Gilles [now in Brussels-Capital region], Belgium), interior minister of Belgium (1861-68); cousin of Ernest Vandenpeereboom.\n\nVandenpeereboom, Ernest (Louis de Gonzague) (b. July 12, 1807, Courtrai, France [now in Belgium] - d. Nov. 11, 1875, Ypres, Belgium), Belgian politician. He was chairman of the Chamber of Representatives (1863-67).\n\nVandenpeereboom, Jules (Henri Pierre François Xavier) (b. March 18, 1843, Courtrai [Kortrijk], Belgium - d. March 6, 1917, Anderlecht [now in Brussels-Capital region], Belgium), war minister (1896-99) and cabinet chief (1899) of Belgium; nephew of Ernest Vandenpeereboom and Alphonse Vandenpeereboom. He was also minister of railways, posts, and telegraphs (1884-99).\n\nVandeput, Steven (b. March 30, 1967, Hasselt, Limburg, Belgium), defense minister (also in charge of civil service) of Belgium (2014-18). He has also been mayor of Hasselt (2019- ).\n\nVandeputte, Robert (Marie Antoine Cyrille) (b. Feb. 26, 1908, Antwerp, Belgium - d. Nov. 18, 1997, Brussels, Belgium), finance minister of Belgium (1981). He was also governor of the National Bank (1971-75).\n\nVander Zalm\n\nVander Zalm, William N(ick), originally Wilhelmus Nicolaas Theodore Marie Vander Zalm, byname Bill Vander Zalm (b. May 29, 1934, Noordwijkerhout, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands), premier of British Columbia (1986-91). His family immigrated to Canada in 1947. He was first elected alderman in Surrey, B.C., in 1965, and in 1969 he became that city's youngest mayor. As a member of the Liberal Party, he ran unsuccessfully in the 1968 federal election. In 1972 he was an unsuccessful candidate for leader of the provincial Liberals. In 1974 he joined the Social Credit (Socred) Party, and the following year he was elected to the provincial legislature in the Socred sweep. Between 1978 and 1983 he held a number of cabinet posts. Throughout his political career, he was noted for his blunt statements. In 1982, for instance, he called his fellow cabinet ministers \"gutless\" when the legislature defeated a land-use bill he had worked on for two years. Women asking for job training were told they would make better homemakers than plumbers, and welfare recipients were told to pick up a shovel. When he received complaints about this latter remark, he responded by selling silver shovel pins and auctioning off shovels at Socred fund-raisers. On July 30, 1986, he defeated members of the hierarchy to become leader of the provincial Social Credit Party. Seven days later he was sworn in as the 27th premier of the province. Having resigned from provincial politics in 1983, he did not hold a seat in the provincial legislature. This was remedied, however, in the general election of Oct. 22, 1986. His party was returned to power, and he was elected to represent the riding of Richmond. In 1987 he became the first Canadian premier to act as host on a regularly scheduled open-line radio talk show. An impatient politician with a dislike of bureaucracy, he promised \"an open and up-front\" style of government.\n\nVanderbilt, William H(enry) (b. Nov. 24, 1901, New York City - d. April 14, 1981, South Williamstown, Mass.), governor of Rhode Island (1939-41).\n\nVanderhoof, John (David) (b. May 27, 1922, Rocky Ford, Colo. - d. Sept. 19, 2013), governor of Colorado (1973-75).\n\nVanderhorst, Arnoldus (b. March 21, 1748, Christ Church parish, South Carolina - d. Jan. 29, 1815, Charleston, S.C.), governor of South Carolina (1794-96).\n\nVanderpoorten, Arthur (Pieter Frans) (b. Feb. 17, 1884, Puurs, Belgium - d. April 3, 1945, Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, Germany), interior minister of Belgium (1940). He was also minister of public works (1939-40).\n\nVanderpoorten, Herman (Frans Geeraard) (b. Aug. 25, 1922, Lier, Belgium - d. Sept. 3, 1984, Lier), interior minister (1966-68) and justice minister (1973-77, 1980) of Belgium; son of Arthur Vanderpoorten. He was also a deputy prime minister and minister of institutional reform (1980).\n\nVanderstichelen, Jules (Edmond) (b. Sept. 18, 1822, Ghent, Netherlands [now in Belgium] - d. July 19, 1880, Brussels, Belgium), foreign minister of Belgium (1868-70). He was also minister of public works (1859-68) and governor of the Bank of Belgium (1878-80).\n\nVandervelde, Émile (Guillaume) (b. Jan. 25, 1866, Ixelles [now in Brussels-Capital region], Belgium - d. Dec. 27, 1938, Ixelles), Belgian statesman. He joined the Belgian Workers' Party in 1889 and soon became its acknowledged leader. He first entered parliament in 1894 as member for Charleroi but after 1900 was returned continuously from Brussels. In the Chamber of Representatives he achieved both influence and prestige and played a prominent part in the struggle to attain universal suffrage (finally granted in 1919), a struggle that resulted in more than one national general strike. Considered to be the most powerful socialist orator in the French language since Jean Jaurès, he played a conspicuous role in all the international Socialist congresses after the beginning of the 20th century. In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, he was summoned to join the government as minister of state, later becoming a member of the cabinet. At the time of peace negotiations and the signing of the Versailles Treaty, he used his influence to obtain the insertion of labour clauses, relating especially to the eight-hour day. As minister of justice (1918-21) in the Liberal-Catholic-Socialist cabinet formed after the war, he effected great humanitarian and scientific reforms in the prison system (1919). After the successes of the Workers' Party in the 1925 elections, he entered the Socialist-Catholic coalition cabinet as foreign minister and played an important part in negotiating the Pact of Locarno among Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain, and Italy. He was subjected to criticism because of his genuine internationalism and anti-militarism, the latter being the immediate cause of the fall of the Henri Jaspar cabinet in 1927. He later was minister without portfolio (1935-36) and minister of public health (1936-37).\n\nVandeurzen, Jo(han Maria Gerardus) (b. June 2, 1958, Heusden, Belgium), justice minister (2007-08) and a deputy prime minister (2008) of Belgium. He was also chairman of Christian Democratic and Flemish (2004-07).\n\nVandiver, Ernest, in full Samuel Ernest Vandiver, Jr. (b. July 3, 1918, Canon, Ga. - d. Feb. 21, 2005, Lavonia, Ga.), governor of Georgia (1959-63); nephew-in-law of Richard B. Russell. An old-style Southern Democrat with a deep drawl and gentlemanly manner, he rose to national attention in 1958 when he vowed that \"no, not one\" black child would sit in a classroom with whites if he were elected governor. His anti-integration pledge, which came just four years after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in its landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling, helped him win the Democratic primary and the keys to the governor's mansion. Many whites in Georgia, Alabama, and other Southern states supported segregationists in the 1950s and 1960s as a protest against the federal government's efforts to extend equal rights to blacks. Vandiver had hoped to focus his administration on weeding out alleged corruption in government, but he was forced into the emotional civil rights debate when federal courts ordered the desegregation of public schools, including the historic University of Georgia in Athens, Ga. Despite pressure from white parents to close the schools rather than bow to the courts, Vandiver decided it was futile for Georgia to fight the federal government on the issue. He convinced lawmakers to repeal anti-desegregation legislation. Many credit Vandiver's reversal for sparing the Southern state the racial turbulence and violence that engulfed neighbouring Alabama and Mississippi in the early 1960s. But Vandiver said that allowing the schools to be integrated was \"political suicide.\" He again ran for governor in 1966, but was forced to withdraw from the race due to a heart attack.

In 1926 he became finance minister, retaining the post until his election as president of Rio Grande do Sul in 1928. From the latter position, he campaigned for the presidency of Brazil in 1930. Defeated in the March election, he claimed fraud and led a revolution in October which overthrew the oligarchical republic. He held power as provisional president from November, and was elected president by the constituent assembly in July 1934. The electorate was quadrupled and granted the secret ballot, women were enfranchised, national unity was heightened, and extensive educational and social reforms were introduced. But on Nov. 10, 1937, he presided over a coup d'état that ended the constitutional government and set up the authoritarian New State (Estado Novo). This in turn was overthrown by coup d'état on Oct. 29, 1945, in a wave of democratic sentiment sweeping the country after World War II. Still, he retained wide popular support. In December 1945 he was elected both as senator and congressman from several states and he chose the position as senator from Rio Grande do Sul. However, he kept a low profile until staging a comeback in 1950, when he was elected president as the candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party. Unable to deal effectively with economic problems, he resorted increasingly to nationalistic appeals to hold popular support. Faced with overpowering opposition from the armed forces, he shot himself rather than be removed from office again.\n\n1 Year of birth was altered to 1883 to meet age limit for admission to military academy; this falsification was only publicly disclosed on the occasion of his centenary.\n\nVargas (Martínez), Héctor José (b.

March 28, 1936, Arequipa, Peru), Peruvian presidential candidate (1990). One of Latin America's most famous novelists, he was elected the first Latin American president of International PEN (Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and Novelists) in 1976. Once a supporter of Cuba, Vargas Llosa since the 1970s had sought to portray himself as a centrist - defending democracy from the extremes of both right and left. In 1987 he stepped into the political limelight with his opposition to the government's attempt to nationalize private banks. Speaking for the conservatives, he accused Pres. Alan García of endangering democracy by attempting to \"concentrate too much power in the hands of the government.\" Prior to that he had been chairman of a special governmental investigation into the murders of eight journalists in Peru's ongoing guerrilla war. Citing the \"moral obligation\" of a Latin American writer to be \"involved in civic activities\" and not simply to make pronouncements from the safety of the sidelines, Vargas Llosa said in 1988 that he would be willing to run for president. Expressing a determination to prevent the election of a Marxist president, he agreed to run as a candidate of the right-wing Democratic Front, a coalition of his own Liberty Movement and the centre-right Popular Action and Popular Christian parties. But he unexpectedly lost the 1990 election in a runoff against Alberto Fujimori. He was a strong critic of Fujimori's 1992 self-coup. In 1993 he was granted Spanish citizenship and in 1994 he was elected a member of the Royal Spanish Academy of Language. In 2010 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

March 24, 1961, Athens, Greece), finance minister of Greece (2015). From January 2004 to December 2006, he served as an economic advisor to opposition leader Georgios Papandreou. After the latter was elected prime minister in 2009, he became a fierce critic of the Papandreou government because of its acceptance of an international bailout. He burst onto the Greek political scene in 2010, warning of impending destruction and urging the government to opt for a default. Although he had no intention of entering politics, he felt he had a \"moral responsibility\" to accept the invitation of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, of the left-wing Syriza party, to become finance minister in 2015. Since taking office in January, he was in the global limelight, partly because of the cliff-hanging debt crisis of his country, but no less because of his maverick style, particularly his acerbic opposition against austerity, which he once characterized as \"fiscal waterboarding.\" He played a key role in convincing the nation to vote \"No\" in a referendum in July on the terms of a bailout. It was mainly symbolic, however, and he resigned immediately afterwards at Tsipras's request in order to help future debt negotiations proceed more smoothly. In 2016 he was a co-founder of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25), a pan-European left-liberal group planning to run in European Parliament elections; in those of 2019 - with Varoufakis standing as a candidate in Germany - it had little success, however. In the Greek parliamentary elections soon afterwards, its local equivalent, the European Realistic Disobedience Front (MeRA25), just managed to surpass the 3% threshold for representation.\n\n1 He told the BBC that while in elementary school he decided to spell his first name with one \"n,\" rather than the standard two, for \"aesthetic\" reasons; when his teacher gave him a low grade for that, he became angry and has continued spelling his first name with one \"n\" ever since.\n\nVarshalomidze, Guram (Khuseynovich) (b. 1939 - d.
