        "text": "Hello fellow international students, a big shoutout to each one of you who's been navigating the challenges of being in a new country, balancing academics, daily chores, and the pursuit of future opportunities. From mastering the art of grocery shopping to acing complex projects, from striving for internships to living away from our families, every effort deserves a pat on the back. While the academic journey is undoubtedly demanding, I want to remind you that there's more to this experience than just coursework and career pursuits. Our time in the U.S goes beyond the classroom, and the vibrant city of Boston offers countless opportunities for exploration and enjoyment. Take a break from the routine and immerse yourself in the cultural tapestry of Boston. Attend fun events happening around the city, meet new people, and learn about their diverse backgrounds. Try your hand at snow skating, embrace the thrill of kayaking, cycle along the picturesque Charles River, and visit the museums that showcase the rich history and artistry of this city. As international students, we are privileged to enjoy various perks that come with our student status. Seize these opportunities because, my friends, these moments are fleeting, and being university students is a chapter that won't last forever. Embracing the full spectrum of university life not only adds richness to our experience but also contributes to our personal and professional growth. Remember, a balanced life is key to maintaining a healthy mind. Engage in hobbies, whether it's sports, arts, or anything that sparks joy. A well-rounded life not only enhances our overall well-being but also contributes to our productivity in academic and professional spheres. So, let's not forget to celebrate our successes, both big and small, and to savor the unique journey we're on. Here's to making the most of our time in the U.S and creating memories that will last a lifetime. Now, let's keep the conversation alive! Share your favorite adventure from the city where you are based or the hobby that keeps you sane in the whirlwind of studies. The comments section is all yours – let's inspire each other to make every moment count! #InternationalStudentLife #BostonAdventures #BalancedLiving #northeasternuniversity #Huskylife\n\nThe sky, truly is your limit You must have been thinking that you are limited because you are just starting. Well, the good news is, you are already on your way to the top. Never give in to that voice of discouragement that you aren't enough or what God has given to you can't take you to the top. They are more than enough As a matter of fact, what you are dispensing to your world, that is your own unique way which can't be compared to another person. Yes!, You are one in a lifetime being and no one, I mean, nobody can do those things exactly the way you do them. Give no room to the voice of people who talk you down. That is really dangerous to your esteem. You shouldn't be apologetic to anyone for doing things right or putting in the best of your ability to do what you do. Keep on moving, set that goal, take up that task, go for that course, Apply for that internship, Reach out to that mentor. Trust me, as you take those milestones, not relenting, God is there to help you at all times Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day!!! #winner #winningmindset\n\nEmbracing the Radiance of Summer: A Season of Growth and Discovery! 🌱🚀 This summer has proven to be an exhilarating voyage of productivity and enlightenment. 🔍📚To begin, I embarked on an invigorating internship and fellowship experience, allowing me to gain practical insights into Creativity legal processes and honed my advocacy skills. I negotiated and drafted contracts with vendors such as the Meezan Banking Group in Pakistan as well as HBL. I stand truly appreciative of the profound impact these experiences have had on my evolution. They have not only provided me with a platform to demonstrate my skill set but have also endowed me with an immersive understanding of the professional landscape that awaits me as I finish my law school journey. 🎥🖌️ Furthermore, I embraced the art of video production and editing—a skill I have yearned to master for nearly half a decade. While the road to mastery is ongoing, I am elated to share that I have made considerable strides, so expect a lot of videos!!! 📚🎓 Shifting focus to Breative with Jolyn As the new term starts, I’m excited for more 1-to-1 meetups with all of the students, as this is part of our commitment to not just be their teachers but also their mentors. 🌟 Achieving a Lifelong Dream: Lighting the Path to Education. Since 2015, I’ve had a dream of doing charity work that’ll benefit the community in the long term, and that’s providing underprivileged kids in remote areas with free education. And with Roshni I’ve been able to achieve just that, this initiative resonates with my unwavering belief in equal opportunities for all. With a lot of joy, I share that I have personally sponsored 16 children, and this circle of impact will undoubtedly expand. 🌆🏍️From Dreams to Reality, my long-standing dream of riding a superbike materialized this summer. Though still have a long way to go, buying and learning to ride my first bike has been nothing but extremely motivational for me, it showed that I can achieve my dreams if I put in enough effort! 🏞️🌏 Exploring Nature's Splendor, One of the biggest advantages of running an online business is the freedom to explore the world while remaining connected. Experiencing breathtaking landscapes, this summer's travels have unveiled nature's profound beauty and bestowed an immense sense of gratification. Moreover, My quest for self-sufficiency led me to embrace gardening, yielding vibrant flowers, tomatoes, and diverse vegetables. Simultaneously, my journey included nurturing the company of seven charming parrots over the past three months. Their presence has been an absolute delight, enriching my life in unexpected ways. What can I say maybe I’m a birds person now! Haha! 🦜 Can’t wait to meet more like-minded people and grow as a person and as a business! How’s your summer been? 😝 #SummerChronicles #GrowthAndDiscovery #InternshipJourney #Entrepreneurship #Charity #Breative\n\nThere’s a common misconception that all academics have the summer off. In reality, many of us continue to teach during this period to supplement our income, or we use the time to conduct research, publish work, or engage in professional development. Here’s why I personally love the summers: - Quality Family Time: It’s an opportunity to spend meaningful time with my family, enjoying activities like traveling. - Rest and Relaxation: Summer provides a rare chance to unwind, sit still, and simply do nothing. - Social Connections: I enjoy meeting friends for coffee or lunch, catching up and enjoying their company. - Travel Adventures: I recently returned from a two-week trip to Europe with my family. When possible, I travel internationally or go home to Cabo Verde. These experiences offer fresh perspectives and inspire me to rethink and enhance my teaching approach for the upcoming semesters. - Goal Setting: I use this time to map out both personal and professional short-term goals and create a vision board to visualize and plan for the future.\n\nSay “Hello 👋” to our summer Public Relations Intern, Rhegan Glidewell! (📸 Her in action!) School: New Mexico State University Major: International Business Year: Junior Hometown: Santa Fe, NM ⭐️What do you love about interning at NMCD? What I love about interning at NMCD, are the hands-on experiences I gain while shadowing my mentor, and interacting with various department members. It's interesting to witness the daily operations across different sections of the department. ⭐️Is corrections what you thought it would be?Before my internship, my knowledge of corrections was limited to what I had seen in movies and TV shows. Working within the New Mexico Corrections Department opened my eyes to the complex work involved, as well as programming, which was quite different from my first thoughts. ⭐️Career goal? My career goal is to complete my degree in international business with a focus on marketing. Ultimately, I aspire to join a multinational company and contribute to global marketing efforts. ⭐️Favorite part about living in New Mexico? I would have to say that my favorite aspect of living in New Mexico, are the sunsets. I often brag to my friends from out of state that our sunsets are some of the best. ⭐️Red, green, or Christmas? Green . . . #corrections #NewMexico #internship\n\nI hate it when people call me 'lucky'. This luck has come with a lot of intention. focus and discipline over long durations of time. Nobody acknowledges the late nights, the tears, the internal conflicts, the overthinking, the sacrifices. Where was this luck when: - I was rejected by NUS and NTU even with >98% in board exams. - my scholarship to study at HKU was taken away after I had achieved the defined criteria. - my principal denied me the opportunity to pursue an internship in the US, even though I had the offer in hand. Luck comes with putting yourself out there, by doing the unconventional, going on the uncharted path, and by being unabashedly optimistic. It comes by being unsatisfied with the status quo, by doing things to change your circumstances, by having a low activation energy. I have created my own luck. Everything was manifested and internally obsessed over before I could see any results. My bias for action has led me to wherever I am today. Everybody dreams but few have the discipline to show up. Every. Single. Day. All meaningful things in life are a result of compounding. Regular effort and daring to dream always precedes luck. Most people do either of the two and expect exponential outcomes. When they fail to achieve their dreams, they either try to pull you down or rationalise it by calling you lucky. Yes, I have a brilliant support system and many well-wishers but I'm more than just lucky.\n\n'𝙄 𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙘𝙖𝙣'𝙩 𝙗𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙫𝙚 𝙄'𝙢 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙪𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙢𝙤𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙤 𝙎𝙬𝙚𝙙𝙚𝙣 🇸🇪 𝙞𝙣 𝘼𝙪𝙜𝙪𝙨𝙩'.
