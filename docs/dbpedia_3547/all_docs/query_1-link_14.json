The construction of a golf course is more than the military trying to replace the democratic sport, soccer, with golf. It is how the golf course is going to affect the people in the surrounding area. Fertilizers and pesticides will pollute the nearby waters, Constructing the golf course would require the government to cut down trees, creating an environmental issue. People who believe in taking care of the natural forests around them were being punished by the military for not agreeing with their course of action. Without an individual voice the people of Mexico came together and had strikes against the golf company, the metal company dumping materials, in order to move toward a more democratic country. Despite globalizing efforts of the govenment, the people of Tepozitlan will always fight for what they believe in.\n\nSubject: Culture/Festivals/Food, Economics/Development, Environment/Geography, Politics/Human Rights, Social Issues\n\nType: Documentary\n\nYear: 2007\n\nDirector: Saul Landau\n\nCountry: Mexico\n\nFilm ID: 789\n\nComments:\n\nCreated: 10/25/2012\n\nCopy: 1 Format: DVD Language: Spanish Subtitles: English Length: 33 Minutes Copy ID: 1416 Comments: Source: Donation Price: 0 Acquired: 10/25/2012\n\nTitle: THOSE I LEFT BEHIND\n\nDescription: Those I Left Behind is a documentary that explores the transnational ties that bind Cuban-Americans in the United States to their families still living on the Island.
