He guided me through studying, researching, writing, revising, and publishing in Mexican history. I cannot adequately express my gratitude to him for his numerous readings of the text and his invaluable suggestions. It has been a privilege to work with him and many other scholars. Yvonne Haddad, Charles Keely, James Brennan, and Evelyn Hu-DeHart helped me ﬁnish a dissertation in history and oﬀered insights to transforming the early research into an accessible book. At Georgetown University, I also would like to thank Dorothy Brown, John Voll, John Esposito, Amira Sonbol, James Collins, and Sonia Jacobson for their continued support. My Georgetown colleagues Michael Socolow, Jennifer Hull Dorsey, Elyse Semerdjian, Kathryn Coughlin, Nadya Sbaiti, and Daniel Bryne have been great friends and critics. The Institute of World Politics in Washington, D.C., and the Georgetown University History Department, Mexico Project, and Center for Latin American Studies provided funding for both research and writing. Wayne Cornelius and Eric Van Young generously oﬀered me a home at the University of California, San Diego, at the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies and the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies in 2001– 2002. As a joint fellow in both centers, I had the opportunity to work with a terriﬁc group of colleagues. The historians’ group of Antonio Ibarra, Kelly Lytle Hernandez, Mark Mairot, Ariel Rodríguez de Kuri, and Daniela Traffano helped me grow more than they realize. At Sonoma State University, Judy Abbott, Steve Bittner, Randy Dodgen, Steve Estes, Mary Halavais, Michelle Jolly, Elizabeth Martínez, Kathleen Noonan, Bill Poe, and Tony White have provided engaging seminars to test many of my ideas. I would also like to thank Sonoma State Provost Eduardo Ochoa and Dean of So-\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\ncial Sciences Elaine Leeder for their continued support of the research and for granting professional leave to write. At the University of California, Berkeley, Laura Nader, Bill Taylor, Walter Brem, and Misha Klein took a special interest in my project and oﬀered generous support in the ﬁnal stages of writing. While revising the manuscript, Jeﬀrey Lesser and Akram Khater graciously read versions of the texts and made insightful suggestions to make it a better book. I would also like to thank the anonymous readers of the manuscript who helped me clarify some points. It has been an excellent experience to work with the editors at the University of Texas. Early in my explorations of Middle Easterners in Latin America, Gladys Jozami and Ignacio Klich suggested ways to reach the few communities of Arabic-speaking immigrants in Latin America. Their excellent scholarship in the ﬁeld has been a source of inspiration at every step of this project, and their ongoing support has been invaluable. In Mexico City, my tíos y tías helped me enormously by opening their homes to me and orienting me around D.F. Muchísimas gracias, Tío-abuelo Mustafa (Roman) Itt Alfaro, Ricardo and Lupe Itt, Arturo, Luz María, Arturito, Lorena Hitt Espinosa, Martha Hitt, and Fernando Hitt. In Cuernavaca, the Hitt Orozco family—Tía Hilda, Tío Carlos, Adriana, Karla and Carlos Antonio, and the Hitt Casas family—Pati, Raúl, and Rodrigo. Tíaabuela Nora Hitt Alfaro and the late Tía-abuela Amine Hitt Alfaro also generously opened their homes to me during research trips. At the Archivo General de la Nación, Patricia Galeana, Jorge Nacif Mina, Arturo Jarrero, and Roberto Beristáin Rocha facilitated my work by oﬀering me access to invaluable documents, and archivists Juventino and Fulencio brightened my days with their gentle humor. My dear friend Rosa María Rojas Montes has often challenged me, leading me to a better understanding of Mexican society. At El Colegio de México, Francisco Alba introduced me to Moisés González Navarro and María Elena Ota Mishima, now deceased. Professor Ota Mishima facilitated meetings with Doris Musalem Rahal and Zidane Zéraoui, who patiently listened to my ideas about Arab immigration and then provided me with new models for analyzing Mexican immigration history. The colegiality of Delia Salazar Anaya and Leticia Reina at the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (inah) provided encouragement and guidance as I searched for ways to explain my ﬁndings. In addition, they extended themselves in helping me locate further sources. In Mexico City, Martha Díaz de Kuri and Geraldo Gozain Frangie from the Centro Libanés oﬀered me insights about the collaborative projects among the Lebanese in Mexico. Martha has continued to open her per-\n\nAcknowledgments xi\n\nsonal archives and share with me her sources and insights. Conversations with Father Paul Kerbage of Nuestra Señora de Líbano gave me excellent comparative perspectives on the Lebanese communities in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia. Marcela Schott de Tamariz and her husband Carlos Tamariz broadened my understanding of Mexican politics, culture, and history. Mexican Army Brigadier General Eduardo Martínez Aduna not only introduced me to the Tamariz family, but he also wrote letters on my behalf to several Mexican archives. At the Universidad Iberoamericana in Torreón, Dr. Sergio Antonio Corona Páez, a wonderful colleague, helped me locate archives, introduced me to people in the community, and oﬀered insights into Laguna society. María Isabel Saldaña Villareal also helped with her work in the Family Papers in the Archivo Histórico. The Abusaid family in Torreón was especially welcoming, and I thank Luis Fernando García Abusaid, María Elena Abusaid de Fernández, J. Fernando Abusaid Quinard, and Angelita for their hospitality. I would also like to thank those laguneros whom I interviewed for their candid responses to my questions. At the Municipal Archive in Torreón, the late Beatriz González de Montemayor and her staﬀ, especially Martha and José Luis, were very helpful. In Saltillo, Arturo E. Villarreal Reyes of the Saltillo Municipal Archives provided access to several useful documents. Martha Rodríguez García at the Centro de Estudios Sociales y Humanísticos in Saltillo also provided enthusiastic support. In Beirut, Guita G. Hourani of the Emigration Research Centre at Notre Dame University provided unlimited access to the Centre’s holdings, for which I am most grateful. At the Centre de Documentation et de Recherches Arabaes Chrétiennes (cedrac), an aﬃliate of St. Joseph’s University, Father Samir Khalil Samir oﬀered me interesting insights on categories of personhood for these early Arabic-speaking immigrants. The Arab Image Foundation was extremely helpful in locating more than thirty-ﬁve images of Lebanese immigrants in Mexico. Eliane Fersan has been an excellent research assistant. Also, Marion Smith, archivist of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, was invaluable in helping me track Syrian entries along the Texas-Mexico border. I would like to thank David Stemper, Gloria Almeyda, and Teresa Garza for their wonderful friendship and their continued interest in this project. This book reﬂects the ongoing faith and encouragement I received from my parents, Chata Alfaro and John Velcamp. My brother, John Velcamp Jr., was central to the development of this project. Robert H. McLaughlin, my husband, partner, colleague, never ceases to amaze me with his editorial pen, gentle criticisms, and good humor.\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nSo Far from Allah, So Close to Mexico\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nIntroduction Looking for Antonio Aychur Itt and Finding Hamud Said Eid\n\nT\n\nhis book follows my journey to locate Antonio Aychur Itt, my great-grandfather, in Mexico and to trace his birth name, Hamud Said Eid, and his birthplace in Lebanon. I never knew my greatgrandfather and knew very little of his eldest son, my grandfather Said Itt Alfaro. My grandfather came to the United States as a bracero worker in the 1940s, and U.S. immigration oﬃcials changed his name to Ruben Alfaro. Stories of these two men have been passed down from generation to generation, capturing my imagination. As I began studying Mexican history, I wondered how and where my great-grandfather’s and grandfather’s stories ﬁt into Mexican historiography. In the fall of 1998 as part of my dissertation research, I began the task of compiling a database of Middle Eastern immigrants who came to Mexico and registered with the Department of Migration in the 1930s. While in my ﬁnal stages of examining more than eight thousand immigrant cards, I stumbled upon the ﬁcha (card) of Antonio Aychur Itt, my great-grandfather. His picture and description matched my family records. This is the only tangible piece of my family’s immigration history that I have ever collected. While doing years of research, however, I realized I had encountered a new dimension of Mexican social history, that there were many ways to be Mexican in the twentieth century. The title of the book, So Far from Allah, So Close to Mexico, derives from Mexican President Porﬁrio Díaz (1886–1911) saying, ‘‘Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States.’’ Since the book aims to broaden notions of mexicanidad and illustrate the diversity of Middle Eastern immigrants, the use of Allah (God in Arabic) extends to the beliefs of the Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Druze immigrants from the Middle East who arrived and eventually settled in Mexico. Some Middle East historians have cautioned that the term Allah in North American culture has come to signify those of Islamic faith. This is not my intent in employ-\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\ning the word Allah; rather I am using the word to speak generally about God and how Arabic-speaking immigrants acculturated in Mexico. The subtitle, Middle Eastern Immigrants in Modern Mexico, accounts for the journey that the Middle Eastern community experienced from arrival in Mexico to becoming Mexican citizens. This journey enabled many of the immigrants to retain aspects of their ‘‘foreignness’’ while joining the Mexican nation. An example of such a Middle Eastern immigrant who naturalizes is Jorge Martínez Abraham (formerly known as Girius Ibrahim Martinos Abraham), who naturalized and founded El Cairo restaurant in Torreón. Martínez Abraham exempliﬁes how Middle Easterners have both embraced their Arab heritage and become Mexican citizens. Caroline Nagel and Lynn Staeheli, in examining Arab immigrants in the United States, suggest that ‘‘it is possible to claim identity as a citizen of a country and to negotiate membership within the bounds of ‘belonging,’ even without claiming to ‘be of’ that country.’’ 1\n\nBook Structure The chapters that follow examine why Middle Eastern immigrants came to Mexico, where they settled, how many came, where they came from, how Mexicans responded to them, why some areas like the Laguna (the lake district, or Comarca Lagunera, which occupies almost the full width of southern Coahuila and far northeastern Durango states) attracted them, and how they positioned themselves. Each chapter asks how and why Middle Easterners are important to the Mexican nation. Beginning with the ﬁrst chapter, ‘‘Amplifying Mexicanidad,’’ the migration process can be divided into four phases: (1) the ﬁrst sojourners, often called turcos (Ottoman subjects), came between 1880 and 1910; (2) during the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), some sojourners and newly arrived immigrants became Middle Eastern merchants, providing necessary goods and services; (3) the 1920s and 1930s marked Syro-Lebanese family reuniﬁcations; and (4) the 1940s brought some World War II refugees as well as the reconstruction of the Lebanese Mexican community. These four phases are by no means the only migratory periods and settlement processes of Middle Eastern immigrants in Mexico; however, they help explain and demonstrate how diﬀerent historical events aﬀected the timing of when groups moved to Mexico and how the Middle Eastern community came into being and changed over time. In Chapter 2, ‘‘Locating Middle Easterners in National and Transnational Histories,’’ I examine Mexican immigrant history and how to place\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nMiddle Eastern immigrants in the historical record. The chapter also discusses the relationship between migrations to Mexico and across Mexico’s northern border to the United States. Mexico thus became known as a ‘‘back door’’ to the United States and became vulnerable to changes in U.S. immigration policies. Chapter 3, ‘‘Turco Sojourners Come to Porﬁrian Mexico,’’ examines why turcos came to Mexico in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In it I discuss the political instability, increased economic competition, and religious tensions in the Middle East that motivated emigration. In addition, Porﬁrian development initiatives are examined as attracting immigrants to Mexico. Analysis of immigrant registration cards combined with immigrant histories detail where the immigrants came from in the Middle East and where they settled in Mexico. Their migration experiences were greatly facilitated by Middle Eastern immigrant networks, which provided money and information to family members and friends. During this early phase of migration, Middle Eastern immigrants began positioning themselves in the Mexican nation. Chapter 4, ‘‘Borderland Merchants in Revolutionary Mexico,’’ explores how the early sojourners’ networks provided an infrastructure to continue with commercial activities during the chaos of the Revolution. Middle Eastern immigrants provided food and arms to the various revolutionary factions. Their ability to maneuver around the strong anti-foreign rhetoric attests to their skills of self-positioning and their unique role in the Mexican nation. The ability to cross into the United States enabled some Middle Easterners to amass large proﬁts while the rest of the country was ﬁghting. At the same time, the immigrants faced greater risks because of anti-foreign sentiments and revolutionary violence. After the turbulent decade of the Revolution, Middle Eastern immigration to Mexico nearly quadrupled in the 1920s. The Middle Eastern community grew, and many of its members permanently settled in Mexico. Meanwhile, Mexican citizens became increasingly uncomfortable with the Middle Easterners’ presence and marketing endeavors. As Mexicans voiced their opposition to the immigrants, Middle Eastern families became more uniﬁed, consolidating their economic enterprises with more kinship ties. Chapter 5, ‘‘Middle Eastern Immigrants and Foreigners in Post-Revolutionary Mexico,’’ analyzes the consolidation of the immigrant community and the slowing of immigration in the 1930s. Tough economic times combined with anti-foreign policies led Mexican citizens to more actively express their dislike of Middle Easterners. This can be attributed to both the larger numbers of immigrants who came in the 1920s and the Mexican citizenry’s demand for help from the federal government in times of\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure I.1. Immigration Card of\n\nAntonio Aychur Itt\n\ncrisis. Complaints against Middle Easterners varied from allegations of setting up illegitimate companies to falsely declaring bankruptcy, and from establishing monopolies to carrying contagious diseases. Letters from citizens, chambers of commerce, and state governments demonstrate a nation searching for a way to control its immigrant populations in the midst of economic, social and political change. Chapter 6, ‘‘Peddling, Positioning, and Prosperity,’’ explores how Middle Eastern immigrants have peddled their identity by carefully positioning themselves between Mexican society and their own immigrant community. Their identity has been rooted in their economic roles of making proﬁts, especially during conﬂict. While making their proﬁts, Middle Eastern immigrants (often referred to as ‘‘the Lebanese colony’’) sought to deﬁne themselves in relation to events in the Middle East and in Mexico. In response to Mexican nation building, many of the successful immigrants aimed to unite and perpetuate their foreignness. They constructed a Lebanese discourse that largely excluded Arabs, Muslims, and Druzes. Chapter 7, ‘‘Meanings of Multiculturalism,’’ synthesizes the text and oﬀers a new means to examine the manifold ways of being Mexican. This concluding chapter examines how immigrants acquired mexicanidad while creating their own Middle Eastern immigrant community, adopting much of the Mexican national discourse, and becoming Mexican citizens. Although retaining their ‘‘Lebaneseness,’’ their immigrant positioning suggests that Mexico is indeed multicultural and demonstrates some social acceptance and tolerance for ethnic diﬀerence. In Chapter 7 I also discuss how the construction of the Lebanese community has created a hegemonic voice for anyone of Middle Eastern descent in Mexico today. The constructed history tends to ignore the diversity of immigrant roles in Mexican history and portrays the early immigrants as primarily Christians from Lebanon. The diversity of the immigrants and their contradictory reception in Mexico has largely been overshadowed by the notion that the Lebanese quickly acculturated and economically dominated.\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nFollowing the text is an appendix of fourteen tables, largely drawing on Middle Eastern immigrant registration cards compiled by the Mexican government between 1926 and 1951. They illustrate how the Middle Eastern migration changed over time, showing the gender breakdown of the immigrants and marital status, nationality, country and city of birth, religion, place of residence in Mexico, place of entry, and occupation. Throughout the text, I reference the tables in parentheses for readers to further examine the variables under discussion.\n\nThe Sources Historians develop their analyses from the sources available. In this inquiry, oﬃcial Mexican sources and Middle Eastern immigrant testimonies were examined for their direct information but also in search of inferences from hidden transcripts.2 Immigrants who did not attain great economic or political success rarely emerged in the historical record, and many seem to have melted into Mexican society. Some were killed in revolutionary conﬂict or during other moments of chaos. In an eﬀort to develop a more holistic portrait of this community, I used several research methodologies. I drew on 8,240 Middle Eastern immigrant registration cards (1926–1951), Mexican immigration laws published in the Diario Oﬁcial (1920s–1940s), citizen complaints about Middle Easterners to Mexican presidents (1920s– 1940s), Middle Eastern immigrant community-based sources (newsletters, novels, and letters), U.S. immigration cases involving Syrians crossing into the United States (1904–1945), and my interviews in 1999 with descendants of Middle Eastern immigrants (1999), whom I have given pseudonyms for this book.3 Middle Easterners are among many immigrant groups who came to Mexico and drew on their foreignness to better their economic and social standing. The geopolitical changes in the Middle East, Porﬁrian economic policies, and U.S.-Mexican relations in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries provide a backdrop against which the analysis here proceeds and interprets 8,240 Middle Eastern immigrant registration cards produced by the National Registry of Foreigners. The Migration Law of 1926 established the National Registry of Foreigners to collect information on immigrants and the Mexican Department of Migration. In trying to get an accurate count of foreigners, these registration cards were processed from 1926 to 1951. It should be noted that 8,240 is the full sample of immigrant registration cards available. Unfortunately, data were not always provided on cer-\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\ntain cards; therefore, the samples from which I draw the following analyses vary. In 1997 Zidane Zéraoui identiﬁed 7,533 Arab immigrants in his analysis of the registration cards.4 In my research at the Archivo General de la Nación (agn) in Mexico City, I discovered an unmarked box that had additional records of Middle Eastern immigrants. I believe this box explains why my sample has 707 more Middle Eastern immigrants than Zéraoui has documented. The information obtained for the cards was largely based on immigrant memory, especially for the earliest immigrants. Therefore, the information recorded was probably more of a snapshot of an immigrant’s life at the time of registration than at the point of entry into Mexico. For instance, my great-grandfather Antonio Aychur Itt (Hamud Said Eid) migrated to Mexico in 1907 but his card was not processed until 1932, thus leaving a twenty-ﬁve-year gap over which to recall his migration experience. His card said he had a Mexican wife and six children; however, this information reﬂects his status in 1932 at age 51, not his situation in 1907. Despite the limitations inherent to the immigrant registration cards, analyses of the cards enable historians and social scientists in general to better understand Middle Eastern migration to Mexico and how the immigrants positioned themselves in their new host country. In addition to the delay in processing the biographic information of the immigrant, there are other limitations with these immigrant registration cards. For instance, the cards identify only lawful immigrants with money to pay the fee to register with the Mexican government. This sample represents Middle Eastern immigrants who entered legally or had the wherewithal to obtain the papers to register. This was a self-selective group. In 1927 Middle Eastern immigrants were required to pay 10,000 pesos (roughly $1,000 today) to enter the country. Thus the truly destitute Middle Eastern immigrant would not be counted in these statistics. Another aspect of the National Registry of Foreigners is Mexican oﬃcials’ lack of understanding of Arab culture and the political situation in the Middle East at the beginning of the twentieth century. Many of the Mexican immigration oﬃcials did not understand that the peoples from the Middle East primarily spoke Arabic.5 Some of the cards stated ‘‘Lebanese’’ and ‘‘Syrian’’ as primary languages, illustrating that some of the Mexican oﬃcials did not know that Lebanese and Syrian immigrants predominantly spoke Arabic as their ﬁrst language. Another possibility is that an immigration oﬃcial, in taking the immigrants’ biographic information, made the assumption that a Lebanese immigrant spoke Lebanese and a Syrian immigrant spoke Syrian. Furthermore, the cards only indicate what languages\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nimmigrants spoke and do not explain the language abilities of these immigrants. It also would seem likely that the immigration oﬃcials recorded other information incorrectly or haphazardly, especially in the case of the names. Many Arabic names appear Hispanicized on the immigrants’ cards, and the order of the names could have been changed. A middle name in Lebanon could have become a ﬁrst name or last name in Mexico. These subtle variations are endless.6 Discrepancies in the data were quite common, particularly in the Mexican census during this period and especially if the enumerators were trying to communicate with people whose ﬁrst language was not Spanish. Unlawful immigrants (who probably were not captured in the censuses) avoided any government oﬃcial such as census takers. For the purposes of this discussion, immigrant registration cards are considered a sample of lawful Middle Eastern immigrants. These cards provide valuable information as to places from which they emigrated and where they settled in Mexico. The immigrants also indicated when they entered Mexico, lending insight into how Middle Eastern immigration evolved over time and responded to Mexican and world events (Table 1). Despite more than a decade of research in Mexico supplemented with studies in the United States and Lebanon, I have not been able to expand the community-based sources.7 To the best of my knowledge, this book is comprehensive with respect to most of the primary and secondary sources available. It is my hope that future scholars will continue to uncover documents housed in the new centers in Mexico and Lebanon focusing on immigration/emigration. Most of the materials I located were in Spanish, and I have provided my own translations for the reader. While ﬁnishing compilation of the immigrant registration database, I consulted with Middle Eastern historian Nadya Sbaiti, a native Lebanese Arabic speaker, to help me examine the immigrant registration cards in order to identify any Arabic names that had been misﬁled or miscoded because of the Hispanicizing of names. In my ﬁndings I report observed inconsistencies in the data. Hayat Abu-Saleh, a native Arabic speaker from the region, translated letters and other documents from the Lebanese Emigration Research Centre (lerc) in Beirut. Letters from Maronite priests residing in Mexico City in the late nineteenth century describe their diﬃculties in adjusting to Mexico and request permission to return home. The task of translating these letters was particularly diﬃcult for a modern-day speaker of Arabic. As lerc continues to build its collection, it should be a rich resource for future scholars. In comparing Lebanese and Mexican sources on immigration, cases of Middle Eastern immigrants, particularly Syrian immigrants, have been well\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\ndocumented in the United States during the twentieth century. The concern of U.S. citizens that Middle Eastern immigrants as well as other undocumented immigrants surreptitiously enter the United States has created a good source of information. For instance, court cases and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (ins) records have led to a better understanding of transnational migration. Mexico was sometimes used as an alternative point of entry for immigrants wishing to enter the United States.\n\nFinding Family After several years of archival research, I found Hamud Said Eid in June 2004. With a travel grant from my university, I went to Lebanon hoping to ﬁnd a trace of my great-grandfather Antonio Aychur Itt. Some wonderful friends and colleagues there drove me to Sibline, the town shown on my great-grandfather’s immigration card. According to his immigrant registration card, he arrived in Mexico in 1907, thus making my quest nearly a century later seem unlikely to succeed. My Lebanese and Syrian friends and I went to the home of the local mukhtar, the Muslim administrative leader in the community, explaining that I was looking for information about a family member who had emigrated to Mexico at the turn of the twentieth century. After coﬀee, long stares, and explanations of my family history, I was told I looked like an Eid because of the shape of my face, and I was directed to the Eid family in the next village. There, at a distant relative’s home, we were treated with caution until an elderly man arrived and said that his prayers had been answered. He had been trying to reach Said Eid, my grandfather, in Brooklyn, New York, since the early 1970s. I explained that my grandfather had passed away at that time, and the family was still in Mexico, with the exception of Said’s children. The man then said my great-grandfather’s name had been Hamud Said Eid. The Arabic Eid became the Hispanicized Itt, as many of my Middle Eastern colleagues had suspected; however, he lost the name Hamud and gave the name Said (meaning ‘‘happy’’ in Arabic) to my grandfather. The Aychur name came from his maternal side, and Antonio was clearly an attempt at assimilating into Mexican culture. With the pieces of the puzzle coming together, I ﬁnally learned how my family’s journey began and felt it was time to share this history of Middle Eastern immigrants coming to Mexico.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\nC\n\nonsider Carlos Slim Helú: ‘‘Slim is credible as a nationalist because, in all of Latin America, Telmex [Telefónicas de México] is the only major privately owned telco [telecommunications company] that’s homegrown. And he has labored to gain the goodwill of people on both ends of Mexico’s ideological spectrum.’’ 1 How does a son of Middle Eastern immigrants proclaim himself a nationalist and representative of the Mexican nation? 2 Carlos Slim Helú, the wealthiest man in Latin America,3 is proudly a Lebanese Mexican. Slim attributes his business acumen to his father, Julián Slim, a Lebanese Christian who escaped the Ottoman Empire’s military draft by ﬂeeing to Mexico in 1902. During the Mexican Revolution, the elder Slim bought out his partner in a Mexico City general store and purchased several nearby commercial buildings. Slim Helú said of his father, ‘‘Now that was courage . . . he taught me that no matter how bad a crisis gets, Mexico isn’t going to disappear, and that if I have conﬁdence in the country, any sound investment will eventually pay oﬀ.’’ 4 The history of Slim Helú and his family illustrates how a few Middle Easterners and their descendants have positioned themselves in Mexican society and have achieved an elite status as ‘‘foreign citizens’’ in Mexico. There are, of course, other Middle Easterners who identify with Mexican culture and who appear to have completely acculturated into the Mexican nation. My tío-abuelo (great-uncle) Mustafa Itt often said to me, ‘‘Hija, soy mexicano’’ (Daughter, I am Mexican). Yet he carries an Arabic surname from his father, who migrated from Sibline in southern Lebanon to Mexico in 1907. How could Carlos Slim Helú feel proudly Lebanese Mexican and my tío-abuelo feel solely Mexican without reference to his Middle Eastern ancestry? The diﬀerence lies in how Middle Easterners in Mexico have forged immigrant positions, some claiming a constructed Lebanese Mexi-\n\n10\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\ncan identity. This claim has roots in commercial activities from peddling to industrial capitalism and has grown into politics and popular culture. Middle Eastern immigrants position themselves between Mexican society and their Middle Eastern immigrant communities. The experiences of Middle Eastern immigrants and the construction of the Lebanese Mexican identity raise a broad historical question: How do immigrant groups position themselves to prosper in a nation-state of purported mestizo origins? How do nation-states, in turn, create conditions for this positioning and prosperity? This book explores how a few Middle Eastern immigrants and their descendants have drawn on an imagined Phoenician past to create an elite Lebanese Mexican class in modern Mexico. Although Middle Eastern immigrants are a well-known group throughout Latin America, few scholarly works have systematically addressed their presence in the historical record. There are several reasons for this that will be explored in the following chapters. Because Mexican nationalism, mexicanidad, a sense of Mexicanness, cannot be explained as monolithic, scholars have had diﬃculty conceptualizing how to place the members of ethnic minority and immigrant groups outside the mestizo (those of mixed Spanish and indigenous descent) construct in Mexican history. To help conceptualize these ideas, revisionist (and post-revisionist) scholarship on race, subalterns, and hegemony has been employed to describe those peoples outside more traditional state formative processes.5 Although in later generations it could be suggested that the wealthier children of early immigrants have become active in Mexican state formation with the intention of creating hegemonic power bases, this book focuses largely on the ﬁrst- and second-generation immigrants who sought to make enough money to return to Lebanon and/or bring other family members to maintain their economic and familial interests. This inquiry examines how the immigrants described themselves and, in turn, forged a place for themselves in Mexican society. As with many immigrant groups, the story is not linear nor clearly demarcated by geography or analytical categories. These immigrants came from a complicated homeland and found a new host country mired in civil strife and nation building. Unlike various other immigrant groups in the Americas, the homelands of Middle Eastern immigrants changed dramatically in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The ﬁrst wave of Middle Eastern immigrants to Mexico, subjects of the Ottoman Empire, left a region known as the provinces of Greater Syria, which encompassed present-day Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine (Figure 1.1). After World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Britain ac-\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad 11\n\nFigure 1.1. The Middle East in 1900\n\nquired control of Iraq, Palestine, and Transjordan, while France took control of the Syrian mandate (Figure 1.2). Under the French, what are now the nation-states of Lebanon and Syria were treated as colonies. In 1920, when the creation of Greater Lebanon was proclaimed, the French objective was to safeguard the Maronite community by making sure it would not be absorbed into a Syrian Muslim state. In 1926, French oﬃcials approved a constitution creating a Lebanese re-\n\n12\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\nFigure 1.2. The Middle East in 1920\n\npublic. However, Lebanon did not declare independence until 1943, while Syrian independence was delayed until 1946 (Figure 1.3). These geopolitical changes complicate categories of analysis when trying to determine where these immigrants migrated from, how they identiﬁed themselves, and how others identiﬁed them. I use the term ‘‘Middle Eastern immigrants’’ to refer to peoples from the region that encompasses the contemporary nation-states of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine (the West Bank, Gaza, and British-mandated territory), Israel, Iraq, Iran, Jor-\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad 13\n\nFigure 1.3. The Middle East in 1948\n\ndan, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula. Although Armenia and Turkey are not widely regarded as Arab states, peoples from these nation-states are often considered part of the Middle Eastern migration to Mexico.6 Deﬁning appropriate categories of personhood to describe these immigrants has sparked considerable debate. Moreover, both after the creation of the state of Israel following World War II and more recently following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the term Arab has become politically charged.7 Scholars such as Zidane Zéraoui and Roberto Marín-Guzmán refer to immigrants\n\n14\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\nfrom the Middle East as ‘‘Arabs,’’ employing the term as an ethnocultural construct.8 I have chosen to use ‘‘Middle Eastern,’’ preferring its geographic connotations in examining the history of peoples who emigrated from the Ottoman Empire at the end of the nineteenth century as well as those who migrated from the region in the twentieth century. Given the departures of early immigrants from the Ottoman Empire, the term turco (Turk) is still used occasionally to describe Middle Easterners.9 ‘‘Lebanese’’ immigrants are thus a subgroup within this larger Middle Eastern migration. Because Lebanon and Syria did not emerge as independent nation-states until the 1940s, earlier immigrants often declared cities and regions as their places of origin and drew on a variety of ethnic and religious identities. The Mexican case is further complicated by variation among Latin American countries where notable populations of Middle Eastern immigrants have settled. In Argentina and Brazil, the term ‘‘Syro-Lebanese,’’ a term coined by the subjects themselves, is used in common parlance; in Mexico and Ecuador, the term ‘‘Lebanese’’ is most often used to encompass all Middle Easterners; in Honduras and Chile, the term ‘‘Palestinian’’ is more common. These variations point to both the problematic nature of these historical categories as well as the particular inﬂux of immigrants and their internal dynamics within each Latin American country. Although ‘‘Middle Eastern’’ can be reductionist (in the same way that ‘‘Latin American’’ can be), it nevertheless oﬀers the most comprehensive nomenclature based on my examination of 8,240 Middle Eastern immigrant registration cards compiled by the Mexican government between 1926 and 1951.10 Asher Kaufman’s monograph Reviving Phoenicia: The Search for Identity in Lebanon carefully traces how, prior to Lebanon’s creation in 1920, Lebanese nationalists looked to the Phoenician past to narrate and justify the existence of Lebanon as a viable nation.11 He argues, The idea that the ancient Phoenicians had crossed the Atlantic was a view shared by many Lebanese and supported by dubious scholarly work. It reﬂected an attempt made by Syro-Lebanese, advocates of the Phoenician identity, to illustrate their contribution to Western civilization since time immemorial. In the American context, it was an attempt to make evident that Syro-Lebanese were actually more American than Americans.12\n\nKaufman suggests that the various Syrian communities in North and Latin America promulgated a Phoenician past as early as 1914;13 however, in Mexico, Lebanese community newsletters did not begin widespread circulation until the1930s. Kaufman nevertheless shows that early in the twen-\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad 15\n\ntieth century, questions of identity circulated among Middle Eastern immigrants in the Americas. As this book will show, while the immigrants observed radical change in their homeland from afar, they also helped to broaden post-revolutionary constructions of the Mexican nation-state and the meanings of mexicanidad.\n\nA Question of National Composition The self-positioning of Middle Easterners in Mexico highlights the contradictions of twentieth-century Mexican nation building and how this immigrant group became both victims and victors of national conﬂicts. From President Porﬁrio Díaz (1886–1911) to post-revolutionary President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–1940), Mexican policy makers aimed to bring Mexico out of underdevelopment by reclaiming ‘‘Mexico for Mexicans.’’ 14 This eﬀort, however, has led to an ambivalent treatment of foreigners. Immigrants, mostly Europeans, who were perceived to potentially ‘‘better’’ the nation with skills and capital—and in some cases fair skin 15—were welcomed by Mexican elites and policy makers. Meanwhile, the Mexican populace often felt exploited by these foreigners. Other immigrants such as the Chinese, Japanese, and Middle Easterners did not meet the criteria of ‘‘bettering’’ Mexico, yet they provided necessary services to the Mexican people. Some even prospered from direct dealings with the poor. These immigrants, often storekeepers or peddlers, improved the lives of campesinos (peasants, agrarian workers) and rancheros (small-scale independent ranchers) with more commercial options such as purchasing items outside the stores of the hacendados (owners of large landed estates), yet many Mexicans still subscribed to anti-foreign attitudes. The inconsistent treatment of foreigners coincides with a national history that often dismisses the importance of immigrants in Mexico. Why has the history of immigration to Mexico been given scant attention? Mexico has had a long immigrant tradition with enduring foreign inﬂuences; however, post-revolutionary discourses in the twentieth century and onward tend to emphasize mestizo constructions to the exclusion of others’ cultures and ethnicities.16 With the dawn of the twentieth century, President Díaz looked in particular to the British and Germans for investments to modernize Mexico and to act as a counterweight to growing U.S. dominance in Latin America.17 Along with an infusion of cash came British and German immigrants eager to capture their share of the proﬁts. In the process of introducing\n\n16\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\nnew economic activities such as mining, money lending, and wholesale trading, the foreigners were also quite visible; thus when Mexicans became frustrated with modernization, they could easily blame foreigners. The early twentieth century also brought an inﬂux of Middle Eastern immigrants who took up peddling, some ﬁnding a niche among French immigrant wholesalers. These immigrant groups, collectively and individually, have contributed to the economic development and construction of the Mexican nation-state.\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad The Spanish are usually seen as an integral part of Mexico, not as immigrants. The Creoles of New Spain, descendants of Spaniards born in Mexico, sought to distance themselves from the Spanish (Bourbon) Crown in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In trying to diﬀerentiate themselves, they helped create a Mexican nation, separate and diﬀerent from Spain. Their participation in the construction of the nation-state has launched a two-century debate about who is Mexican. The scant discussion in the national discourse about the infusion of other immigrants and their cultures in Mexico attests to the dominance of the Creole legacy. Historically, the situation of the Spaniards has been the most complex because of their widespread ‘‘conquering’’ inﬂuence that has led to the cultural (and some would say biological) construction of the mestizo and ultimately, the ‘‘cosmic race.’’ 18 The Mexican national discourse tends to assign Mexicans as Spanish or Indian or mestizo. This tripartite ethnic scheme began with the Conquest and became the dominant basis of deﬁning who is Mexican. The narrow ethnic construction suited Spanish colonial interests in limiting who enjoyed privileges such as landownership and participation in Spanish government. Although the Mexican national discourse has changed over time, it has tended to employ mexicanidad as a means to draw on indigenismo and Europeanness in its nationalism.19 According to José Vasconcelos, post-revolutionary Secretary of Public Education, the cosmic race theory suggests taking the best of Spanish and Indian cultures and creating a new hybrid race: The advantage of our tradition is that it has greater facility of sympathy towards strangers. This implies that our civilization, with all defects, may be the chosen one to assimilate and to transform mankind into a new type; that within our civilization, the warp, the multiple and rich plasma of future humanity is thus being prepared.20\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad 17\n\nVasconcelos contended that it is the contribution of the Spanish that helps the mestizo improve himself or herself. Earlier than Vasconcelos’ writing, Justo Sierra, Minister of Public Education and Fine Arts from 1905 to 1911, suggested that ‘‘foreign elements’’ indeed helped Mexican social evolution. Sierra wrote between 1900 and 1902: ‘‘We need to attract immigrants from Europe so as to obtain a cross with the indigenous race, for only European blood can keep the level of civilization . . . from sinking, which would mean regression, not evolution.’’ 21 Accordingly, the mestizo represented a way in which to create a liberal model of homogeneous integration of all ethnic groups. By encouraging individual groups—speciﬁcally indigenous peoples—to shed their distinctive characteristics and to become mestizo, they could become part of an evolving Mexican nation. Similarly, Yucatecan positivist social critic Andrés Molina Enríquez in 1909 advocated an ethnic scheme of Creoles, Spaniards, and mestizos. He believed that the continuation of the mestizo as the dominant ethnic group would encompass Mexico’s indigenous origins as well as constitute a truly national population.22 Alan Knight writes, ‘‘Mexico could achieve demographic growth without recourse to immigration . . . mestizaje and nationhood were equated.’’ 23 Together Sierra, Molina Enríquez, and later Vasconcelos and others advocated mestizaje as the foundation of what it is to be Mexican.24 Historian Arthur Schmidt explains that decades after the Mexican Revolution, ‘‘indigenismo and economic development served as powerful hegemonic symbols for Mexico’s national identity, for the image of a homeland that would provide for all Mexicans.’’ 25 With time, however, this national project collapsed. The marginalization of the indigenous peoples and massive Mexican emigration created an ‘‘enduring crisis of self deﬁnition.’’ 26 D. A. Brading echoes much of Schmidt’s assessment and notes of Manuel Gamio, the father of Mexican anthropology and famed excavator of Teotihuacán pyramids, that there is little doubt that his indigenismo derived from his liberalism and was animated by a modernising nationalism, which promoted the incorporation and assimilation of the Indian communities into the urban, hispanic population. The ultimate and paradoxical aim of oﬃcial indigenismo in Mexico was thus to liberate the country from the dead-weight of its native past, or, to put the case more clearly, ﬁnally to destroy the native culture which had emerged during the colonial period.27\n\nWhile some post-revolutionary intellectuals suggested that the lack of ethnic integration and indigenous traditions were at the root of many of Mex-\n\n18\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\nico’s problems, they also worked to curb the arrival of undesirable immigrants, such as those coming from the Middle East. But as Serge Gruzinski aptly points out, It is hard to know exactly what this ‘‘mestizo eﬀect’’ covers—its dynamics are not really questioned. Mixing, mingling, blending, crossbreeding, combining, superimposing, juxtaposing, interposing, imbricating, fusing, and merging are all terms associated with the mestizo process, swamping vague description and fuzzy thinking in a profusion of terms.28\n\nIt is within this ‘‘fuzzy thinking’’ that we ﬁnd the construction of mestizaje, implicit to mexicanidad, as a dominant cultural category that fuses the Spanish and Indian in everything Mexican. Marilyn Grace Miller successfully challenges the mestizo construction: ‘‘Whereas mestizaje has been taken as a monolithic discourse and a commonplace of latinoamericanismo, a tour of its myriad appearances in textual and other expressive formats divulges a trajectory of tremendous variance, polarization, juxtaposition, and opposition.’’ 29 The monolithic assumption derives from the writings of Molina Enríquez, who equated Mexico with lo mestizo; Manuel Gamio reiterated this interpretation in 1916.30 Miller suggests that intellectuals throughout the Americas have used notions of mestizaje and the cosmic race to their ideological ends, causing confusion and ambiguities as to nationalism, identity, and ethnicity throughout the twentieth century. However, Agustín Basave Benítez succinctly notes that ‘‘the tendency to link mestizaje and mexicanidad responds essentially to a search for national identity.’’ 31 Mexicanidad, in my analysis, has therefore come to refer to the sense of feeling Mexican by and among Mexican nationals yet remaining open to a range of individual and collective interpretations depending on one’s own situation and experiences. The ability of Middle Eastern immigrants to position themselves in Mexico can be explained in part by the ﬂexibility of the concept of mexicanidad and by varying interpretations of what it means to be Mexican. Henry Schmidt, for example, suggests that allied terms mexicanidad, mexicanismo, and lo mexicano all refer to the Mexican ethos as well as to its study and therefore become a driving principle for the growth of knowledge related to Mexico.32 But what is the Mexican ethos? Roger Bartra argues that ‘‘studies on Mexicanness constitute an expression of the dominant political culture. This hegemonic political culture is bound by the set of imaginary power-networks that deﬁne socially accepted forms of subjectivity and that are customarily considered as the fullest expression of\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad 19\n\nnational culture.’’ 33 Accordingly, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (pri) has been creating a type of ‘‘metadiscourse’’ that many Mexicans and non-Mexicans use to explain national identity.34 This discourse is premised on what Bartra terms ‘‘commonalities of the Mexican character’’ and founding myths of the Mexican Revolution.35 It can accommodate and integrate social diﬀerence, tolerate diﬀerence, and alternately suppress, disregard, and obscure diﬀerence such that the terms mexicanidad, mexicanismo, and lo mexicano promote uniﬁed, homogeneous meanings. The mythical accounts of the Mexican Revolution that inform this discourse tend to pertain to Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.36 Public oﬃcials and intellectuals have drawn on carefully selected cultural symbols—such as Zapata and Bénito Juárez—to describe what and who is Mexican. These constructions have ignored the rich cultural mosaic of Mexican society. Instead, they promulgate the tripartite ethnic and racial description—begun during the colonial era—of Mexicans as Spanish, indigenous, or mestizo. Apart from the metadiscourse of mexicanidad, however, most Mexicans readily acknowledge the role of the turco merchant among other ﬁgures such as a Basque supermarket owner in their social landscape. Why, then, does a discrepancy exist between Mexican intellectuals and popular tradition? This discrepancy between the popular recognition of diﬀerence and the mestizo image reﬂects yet another diﬃculty in describing who is Mexican and who ought to be citizens of Mexico. Rodolfo Stavenhagen and Tania Carrasco write, ‘‘Mexico is essentially a multicultural country not only for its indigenous and Iberian culture, but also for the contribution of the immigrant cultures.’’ 37 Ultimately, the mestizo construction aimed to temper the inﬂuence of foreigners and the visibility of the indigenous, thereby limiting plurality. Despite the intellectuals’ and state’s attempts to construct a monolithic, homogeneous Mexican, the Mexican populace has come to include diverse immigrants in a pluralistic society in which there are many ways of being Mexican. The ambiguities of what it means to be Mexican beyond the mestizo construction have allowed immigrants from the Middle East simultaneously to position their status in the Mexican metadiscourse and to create their own Lebanese discourse.\n\nFrom Immigrants to Foreign Citizens The infusion of Middle Eastern immigrants in Mexico increased tensions among classes and aﬀected how Middle Eastern immigrants positioned\n\n20\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\nthemselves and their goods. As Mexican policy makers at the federal and state levels designed policies to appease displaced middle-class Mexicans in the 1920s and 1930s, they also tried to accommodate immigrants who supplied a needed part of Mexico’s economic infrastructure. While some immigrants were denied admission into Mexico, others were granted it and, later, citizenship. The Great Depression that began in 1929, combined with anti-foreign rhetoric, raised concerns about who should be allowed into Mexico and who should become Mexican citizens. The international environment— exempliﬁed to some extent by the United States closing its borders—coincided with these questions among Mexican citizens and policy makers about which immigrants were ‘‘worthy’’ and which were not. As postrevolutionary intellectuals pushed the cult of the mestizo (that is, mestizophilia), they stressed homogenization as fundamental to the nation’s development and health.38 Portrayals enhancing Mexico’s modernization posed Middle Eastern immigrants, among others, as instead carrying disease and increasing poverty and criminality. Restrictive policies were made, yet they were not always enforced. Thus, how Middle Eastern immigrants positioned themselves in Mexican society oﬀers an alternative perspective to traditional conceptualizations of who is Mexican and who can become Mexican citizens. The ability of Middle Eastern and other immigrant groups—Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews,39 Spaniards, French, Germans,40 Italians, Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese 41—to develop commercial enterprises reﬂects demands in the Mexican economy during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Immigrants, savvy to market demands, quickly learned how to supply Mexican consumer demands. Some Middle Eastern immigrants, as their commercial endeavors led to economic success, began to position themselves both as Mexicans and as foreigners in Mexican society. As President Díaz sought to emulate European modernization, he looked to foreign investment to bring Mexico out of underdevelopment and ‘‘backwardness.’’ 42 The Mexican Revolution and post-revolutionary regimes in the 1920s and 1930s aimed to replace the Porﬁrian model and redeﬁne the nation as a Mexico for Mexicans. Revolutionary rhetoric often became xenophobic, denouncing those who had pillaged Mexico of its resources. Yet despite the rhetoric, immigrants continued to come and settle in Mexico. If anti-foreign sentiments were so strong, how could immigrants continue to migrate and establish themselves in the early twentieth century in Mexico? Despite the revolutionary discourse that emphasized the mestizo, the\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad 21\n\n‘‘Mexican foreign tradition’’ continued. This tradition privileged outsiders who were seen to help Mexico progress. It dates back to the colonial period when the early Spaniards often viewed foreigners as bringing the necessary skills for Mexico to develop. The fear of foreign merchants and their exploitation of native peoples likewise can be dated to the colonial period when foreigners composed much of the merchant class. In 1681 the Laws of the Indies speciﬁed that ‘‘no foreigner or excluded person be allowed to trade in the Indies, or go to them.’’ 43 In the seventeenth century, poor peasant families from the Basque region often sent their sons to New Spain to make their fortunes. Charles Nunn explains that ‘‘since [colonial] immigrants often came to make their fortunes, few had signiﬁcant assets upon arrival. In Spain, the Casa de Contratación kept a full watch on everyone who sailed from the mother country to the Indies.’’ 44 This pattern of poor families migrating to Mexico with ambitions of wealth has occurred frequently throughout Mexican history.45 In the nineteenth century, Mexican intellectuals struggled to create a unique national identity based on European traditions. At the turn of the twentieth century, Spanish peninsular merchants, French and British bankers, and U.S. mining investors provided critical goods and services while maintaining their ethnicity. Unlike less powerful immigrant groups, who tended to acculturate as a tactic of survival, these foreigners with Mexican citizenship often kept their culture and maintained their ‘‘foreignness.’’ Many became wealthy through their development projects and established themselves within the Mexican elite. In looking at North American and European democracies, Bonnie Honig suggests that foreignness can be relational and fungible in that it reﬂects the values of the society. In particular, Honig examines the role of the capitalist foreigner, who, although ‘‘depicted as someone who is interested in material things, . . . quickly turns from someone who has something to oﬀer us into someone who only wants to take things from us.’’ 46 This transition from an inquisitive immigrant to a self-serving materialist resonates with popular Mexican reﬂections on the role of the Middle Eastern immigrants in the country. Although Honig’s analysis is limited to liberal democracies, her usage of foreignness and the notion that foreigners enable regimes to import needed skills and talents can be applied to Mexico. The contradictory reception and treatment of foreigners in Mexico can be described as a ‘‘foreign citizen’’ paradigm. Luz María Martínez Montiel describes this dilemma by arguing that to be foreign in Mexico is a guarantee of wealth, creating a paradox throughout Mexican history. Mexicans feel xenophobic because of foreigners’ wealth.47 Yet foreignness be-\n\n22\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad\n\ncomes a means of legitimation and path to elite status.48 Not unlike other countries seeking to develop, Mexico has depended on outside resources. Therefore, those in Mexican society most capable of attracting foreign investment are most able to thrive economically. The ‘‘foreign citizen’’ mediates a contradictory and mutually reinforcing relationship that allows outsiders to maintain multiple identities, including the identity of an ‘‘insider’’ in Mexico. This notion that citizenship can be granted to a foreigner on the promise that he or she brings skills and capital is not uncommon. However, in Mexico and perhaps other Latin American (and other ‘‘developing’’) countries, the ability to declare foreignness across generations helps explain how elites distance themselves from their poor paisanos and command a sense of entitlement. The irony is that to climb the Mexican economic ladder, one needs to have enough Mexicanness to work within the system. Yet once the person has reached economic elite status, he or she often claims his or her foreign roots (as if) to explain success. How have Middle Eastern immigrants participated in this ‘‘foreign citizen’’ trajectory? The ﬁrst generation often downplayed cultural diﬀerences to better acculturate into Mexican society. However, by the second and third generations, with economic ascent, some Middle Eastern immigrants were able to create a new Lebanese Mexican identity,49 as further addressed in Chapter 6. In contrast, Middle Eastern immigrants who did not make fortunes tended to acculturate into the mestizo Mexican culture, similar to my tío-abuelo, a middle-class Mexican. Mexico has a rich immigrant history too often ignored in analyses focused on the Mexican Revolution and mestizaje. Moreover, the case of Middle Eastern immigrants demonstrates the diversity of the immigrant ﬂows into Mexico and how Mexicans accommodated social diﬀerence in varying degrees. Perhaps most importantly, the evolution of Middle Eastern immigrants creating a Lebanese Mexican community illustrates how the ‘‘foreign tradition’’ has resonated in society to create ‘‘foreign citizens.’’ Peter Sahlins in his monograph Unnaturally French: Foreign Citizens in the Old Regime and After analyzes how foreigners in seventeenth-century France who naturalized were not treated as citizens, especially in the examination of tax records under the Old Regime.50 According to Sahlins, ‘‘Foreign citizens were, no doubt, a privileged group of immigrants, although not literally in the Old Regime sense, since only a small proportion were nobles.’’ 51 Sahlins suggests that prior to the creation of modern nation-states, notions of citizenship were deﬁned primarily in opposition to the foreigner, and ‘‘naturalization as administrative practice, moreover, never fully protected the foreigner from all the civil incapacities, espe-\n\nAmplifying Mexicanidad 23\n\ncially the liability to special taxes, that accumulated during the early modern period.’’ 52 Similarly to Sahlins’ foreign citizens of seventeenth-century France, Middle Eastern immigrants who naturalized in twentieth-century Mexico often retained elements of their foreignness, manifest in such gestures as opening a restaurant named after an Egyptian city. Unlike many European immigrants, Middle Easterners often appeared to be Mexican in their dealings with rural communities. Yet, over time their larger investments in industrial projects served national interests and enabled them to then emulate Europeans by seeking to construct a unique Lebanese Mexican community. Despite anti-foreign revolutionary rhetoric, the post-revolutionary Mexican nation continued to draw on foreignness as a means of legitimation, especially in elite circles. Middle Eastern immigrants, by peddling their legitimacy and their wares, fused their immigrant status with Mexican citizenship and in turn expanded the meaning of the Mexican nation in the twentieth century. Mexican citizens at home and abroad often feel multiple loyalties that extend to the Mexican nation, their regions, and more particularly their towns.53 Their sense of belonging extends to two (three and four) homelands simultaneously. They identify with their hometown, patria chica; their country, patria; their adopted country, segunda patria; and their adopted hometown, segunda patria chica.54 These loyalties become further complicated by religion and marriage partners. Olga Seba, a second-generation Lebanese, said in an interview, ‘‘We carry [have] a double life, when I am in the house, I am Lebanese, and in the street, I am Yucatecan.’’ 55 Like some transnationals,56 Middle Easterners maintain far-reaching linkages such that immigrants in Mexico have ties to relatives in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, for example. Their social identities emerge from the globalization of the world economy and the construction of webs of social relations. The links are more diﬃcult to trace and document; however, individual case studies show that some Middle Eastern immigrants and their children feel more Mexican, while others adopt multiple identities. Immigrants have, for the most part, participated in the Mexican discourse by adopting mestizo identities. This illustrates the fungibility of mexicanidad. This fungibility denotes the relational and contextual use of identity as theorized by historian Prasenjit Duara.57 Duara examines national communities as relationships based on inclusions and exclusions and how the competing visions intersect with alternative criteria of identity formation.58 By building on Duara’s framework that nationalism is a continually contested and negotiated space for multiple groups to live, which he applies to Chinese history, I argue that ethnic groups in Mexico vary in their\n\n24 Amplifying Mexicanidad\n\nabilities to acculturate, and some choose to maintain their ethnic identities, especially as they ascend the Mexican economic and social ladder. In contrast, Middle Eastern immigrants who were less economically successful tended to more fully integrate into the metadiscourse of mexicanidad. Although post-revolutionary intellectuals aimed to temper the inﬂuence of foreigners and the visibility of the indigenous by emphasizing the mestizo, Lebanese Mexicans became successful foreign citizens, simultaneously illustrating the diversity of the Mexican nation and the fungibility of mexicanidad. Although many have described Lebanese Mexicans (immigrants and subsequent generations) as having a double identity, one Mexican and the other Lebanese,59 immigrants’ identities tend to be far more dynamic and diverse. At one level, Middle Eastern immigrants became Mexican citizens, yet some constructed a parallel loyalty to Lebanon. In creating their Mexicanness, they built on the Mexican elites’ sense of foreignness in Mexico. What becomes particularly interesting is how Middle Easterners, who were traditionally deemed undesirable immigrants, could adopt a sense of foreign superiority. How did the constructed Lebanese community overcome Mexican prejudices to be accepted as elites worthy of foreignness? The answer, in part, turns on regional diﬀerences within Mexico. To be Lebanese in the Yucatán is diﬀerent from being Lebanese in the Laguna or in Mexico City. Perhaps the most striking diﬀerence is between the Lebanese community in Mexico and the Lebanese living in Lebanon. The community’s sense of Mexican elitism diﬀerentiates them from their Lebanese counterparts living in the Middle East. According to a Lebanese immigrant living in Mexico City in 1999, ‘‘You can’t compare these Lebanese with the Lebanese in Lebanon . . . most of them [those at the Centro Libanés] did not speak Arabic.’’ 60 This disjunction between those from Lebanon and the descendants of Middle Eastern immigrants exempliﬁes both how the construction of Lebaneseness has been unique in Mexico and how immigrant homeland memory may depart from homeland reality.61 As the second and third generations retold and perhaps reinvented family stories, the lines between the real and imaginary became blurred and distorted, creating a distinct Lebanese Mexican community.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nLocating Middle Easterners in National and Transnational Histories\n\nJ\n\norge Amado, in his popular novel Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon, describes a Middle Eastern character, Mr. Nacib, as follows: ‘‘His many friends called him Arab or Turk, and they did so as an expression of intimacy, of aﬀection. He did not much mind Arab, but he hated to be called Turk. . . . ‘Call me anything you want except Turk. I’m a Brazilian.’ ’’ 1\n\nAlthough Amado’s character reﬂects the Middle Eastern experience in Brazil, this ﬁctional anecdote resonates throughout Latin America, showing how some Middle Eastern immigrants felt about the term turco. As Ignacio Klich and Jeﬀrey Lesser point out, turco is an imposed rather than a self-constructed identiﬁcation.2 The term refers to an area of the former Ottoman Empire. Despite its historical and geographical orientation, however, the term carries negative connotations in Mexico. In this chapter I begin an interrogation of the term turco and its alternatives as they exist in the historical record, and I explore the role of Middle Eastern immigrants in twentieth-century Mexico. I begin by examining Mexican immigrant history and ways to account for Middle Eastern immigrants in the historical record. By exploring various sources, I hope that readers begin asking questions to further studies in the area of immigration to Mexico. In tracing Mexican immigrant history, the foreign merchant tradition emerges by which some of the Middle Eastern immigrants positioned themselves in Mexican society to later become foreign citizens.\n\n26 Locating Middle Easterners\n\nMexican Immigrant History Charles Gibson has suggested that the modern migratory past began six centuries before the arrival of the Spanish in 1519 during ‘‘a time of new immigration, by Tolteca, Chichimeca, Otomi, and ‘Aztec’ peoples.’’ 3 The Aztecs, or ‘‘Mexicas,’’ were believed to be migrants from northern Mexico who built Tenochtitlán at a site in what is now Mexico City. Once the Spanish arrived, they cleverly negotiated with rivals (Tlaxcallans and Chalcans) to help overthrow the Aztecs.4 With the assistance of these rivals, the Spanish eventually took formal power in 1521 and ruled until 1821. As colonizers for three centuries, emigrants from Spain continued to come to Mexico to develop the ‘‘New World.’’ These peninsulares, as the Spaniards were called because they were from the Iberian Peninsula, often worked as wholesale merchants, providing goods and services to the Spanish communities in Mexico. The role of merchants in colonial Mexico thus became assigned to foreigners.5 Harold Sims explains that ‘‘peninsulares had always enjoyed social and economic advantages in Mexico, of course, by virtue of their undisputed limpieza de sangre (purity of blood) . . . The importance of Spaniards in Mexican society—a condition inherited from the colonial period—was reﬂected in their continued prominence in commercial enterprises. . . . Commerce was a predominant occupation of Mexico’s Spaniards.’’ 6 Although many of the important comerciantes were peninsulares, not all peninsulares were comerciantes.7 The Spanish Crown tried to regulate who could come to the Americas. In principle, only Spanish subjects of ‘‘pure’’ blood—those not from Moorish or Jewish descent—were permitted to emigrate. Estimates suggest that between 1504 and 1650, approximately 450,000 Spaniards migrated to the Americas, the majority opting for New Spain (Mexico).8 Emigration was voluntary and regulated by the Spanish House of Trade and the Council of the Indies that oversaw the reports and licenses of the migrants. As the Spanish colonies grew in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, however, immigration became more diﬃcult to regulate. A recent translation of a travel memoir of a Chaldean priest named Elias al-Mûsili suggests that Middle Eastern interest in the Americas and Mexico in particular can be dated to the seventeenth century as well.9 European politics at the time are generally viewed to have determined the makeup of the foreign community in Mexico. It is estimated that Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Italians, and English comprised 2,000 of the non-Spanish European community during the colonial period; scholars also speculate that Mexico received more than 200,000 Africans during this time.10 Like these Afri-\n\nLocating Middle Easterners 27\n\ncans, many Asians came to Mexico as slaves. In the seventeenth century, about 600 Asians entered Mexico each year. According to D. A. Brading’s study of Guanajuato, Mexico, in the late eighteenth century, non-Spanish European males composed only 3 percent of the workforce in 1792.11 Labor depended heavily on these other groups. During this colonial occupation, the Spaniards imported many African slaves to sugar-producing communities such as Veracruz and Morelos. These slaves were forced into migration, and their presence in Mexican society has further challenged who belongs to the Mexican nation.12 Nancy P. Appelbaum, Anne S. Macpherson, and Karin Alejandra Rosemblatt suggest that Afro-Mexicanness employs a racialized discourse whereby regions with black populations are not fully considered part of the nation.13 Given the widespread dispersal (Veracruz, Morelos, and Oaxaca) of Africans throughout Mexico, it seems quite probable that Afro-Mexicans have also positioned themselves among mestizos from the colonial period through the present day.14 After the war for Mexican independence from 1810 to 1821, Mexico struggled to deﬁne the role of Spanish immigrants in Mexico. In1824 Mexican oﬃcials asked Spaniards to leave the country and ordered the expulsion of Spaniards by 1828.15 Harold Sims argues that in light of the Iberians’ dominance of commerce, I would suggest that although the expulsions were the result of a broadly based, nationalistic anti-Spanish movement, a substantial source of criollo pro-expulsionist sentiment was mercantile rivalry between Mexicans and Spaniards during a period of severe economic decline.16\n\nWhen Mexican liberals later accused conservatives of being anti-immigration and unprogressive, some elites sought to reestablish ties to the Spanish Crown in 1836. As Mexicans fought over how to build the new nation, Texas declared its independence from Mexico in 1836, and the United States took advantage of its position and went to war with Mexico in 1846. As an outcome, in 1848 Mexico lost more than half of its territory. Despite the war, American entrepreneurs continued migrating to Mexico to make their fortunes. An estimated 5,412 foreigners resided in Mexico in 1852, and by 1910 more than 20,000 Americans lived in Mexico.17 Also during the nineteenth century, French immigrants came to Mexico, often replacing the peninsulares as merchants and sometimes becoming wealthy.18 While the British and French founded Mexico’s ﬁrst modern banks, French immigrants from Barcelonnette, along with Germans and\n\n28\n\nLocating Middle Easterners\n\nSpaniards, owned many of the warehouse stores that formed the hubs of an extensive wholesale network.19 These foreigners enjoyed diplomatic protection and maintained their status as ‘‘outsiders’’ as Benito Juárez pushed for increased immigration to infuse the Mexican populace with Protestant values.20 However, Napoleon III decided to extend his empire and in 1863 sent Archduke Maximilian Von Habsburg to take control over Mexico. By 1867 Maximilian was executed and the Mexicans expelled the French, further fostering anti-foreign sentiments among many Mexicans. Meanwhile, the U.S. Civil War had come to a close, and some newly freed black slaves who sought a new life migrated to northern Mexico.21 Yet the arrival of these immigrants did not ﬁt with notions of ‘‘bettering’’ the nation, and within a few decades a large portion of Afro-Americans returned home. With the hope of transforming Mexico’s ‘‘backward’’ indigenous past and mounting debts, President Porﬁrio Díaz promoted immigration to alleviate Mexico’s ills. In 1883 the government passed the Colonization and Naturalization Laws of the Republic to encourage settlement in sparsely populated areas and to bring development to Mexico. Immigrants from Italy were among the ﬁrst colonists. Díaz’ openness to immigration extended to Japan and China. In November 1888 the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between Mexico and Japan facilitated the immigration of Japanese. Between 1891 and 1908, roughly thirty-four Japanese emigration companies sent thousands of Japanese emigrants abroad.22 In 1893 Mexico and China signed a Treaty of Amity and Commerce containing a ‘‘most favored nation’’ clause welcoming Chinese immigrants. After the United States terminated Chinese immigration by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882,23 Mexico became an attractive alternative for Chinese immigrants.24 However, by 1896 the colonization program was abandoned for being too costly and ineﬃcient and taking too long to implement.25 It is within this context that Middle Eastern migration to Mexico can be explored, locating immigrants in national and transnational histories.\n\nExploring National History The trajectory of Middle Eastern immigrants becoming itinerant traders selling small trinkets and goods throughout the Americas is well known. A paucity of sources, however, has left the Middle Eastern communities in the Americas to construct their histories as told to them by their relatives.26 Although literary works like the aforementioned Gabriela, Clove and Cin-\n\nLocating Middle Easterners 29\n\nnamon make references to the role of the turco,27 a comprehensive history of Middle Eastern immigration to the Americas has yet to be written. Scholars have only begun to develop comparative studies on how Middle Eastern immigrants position themselves in various Latin American countries. With the exception of the edited volumes by Ignacio Klich and Jeﬀrey Lesser and by Albert Hourani and Nadim Shehadi,28 most studies on Middle Eastern immigrants tend to focus on speciﬁc countries. Moreover, while some scholars have described the Middle Eastern immigrant experience in the Americas, few address the historical signiﬁcance of Middle Eastern immigrants in Mexican history and Latin American history in general.29 This study examines how the conﬂicts of revolutionary Mexico provided Middle Eastern immigrants the opportunity to prosper and create their own unique community in the post-revolutionary nation. Middle Eastern immigrants successfully positioned themselves in Mexican society by exploiting conﬂictual moments and building on the Mexican tradition of foreign entrepreneurship. During the late nineteenth century, immigrants from the Middle East came to Mexico intending to make their fortunes quickly and to return to their home countries or pass through to the United States. As the immigrants entered Mexico at the turn of the twentieth century, admissions into the United States became more diﬃcult, Mexico became embroiled in its Revolution, and the Ottoman Empire participated in World War I. Together these events indeﬁnitely delayed the immigrants’ return to their homelands. Consequently, many immigrants permanently settled in Mexico and subsequently brought over other family members. Historical events in the Middle East as well as Mexico and other parts of the Americas helped to determine where immigrants landed. Their settlement patterns reﬂect economic motivations, politics, and complex social networks. Between 1895 and 1940, approximately 36,000 Middle Eastern immigrants migrated to Mexico.30 According to the Centro Libanés Website (www.centrolibanes.org), approximately 380,000 of Mexico’s 100 million people have Lebanese ancestry.31 The Centro Libanés is a social club throughout Mexico for those of Lebanese descent, with nine clubhouses: in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Veracruz, Chihuahua, Mérida, Puebla, Monterrey, Tampico, and San Luís Potosí. Although this immigrant group is not numerically large, it commands substantial economic and political power in Mexico, as will be discussed in Chapter 6. Most Middle Eastern immigrants arrived in Mexico not knowing Spanish. Many were illiterate, had few skills, and were not particularly interested in farming. Their circumstances encouraged them to start peddling.\n\n30\n\nLocating Middle Easterners\n\nAlthough not all Middle Eastern immigrants began as peddlers, many did; historical records tend to describe many Middle Eastern immigrants beginning with this occupation. As the Mexican nation developed, it had limited networks for the distribution of household goods and with small villages separated by long distances, presenting opportune circumstances for the peddler to play a critical role.32 Much of the status of Middle Easterners derived from their roles in the Mexican economy. Early immigrants often brought their initial goods from other countries and then borrowed capital from their immigrant countrymen. According to Lebanese Mexican oral tradition, the ﬁrst Middle Eastern immigrant to Mexico was Butros Raful, a Lebanese missionary who arrived in the nineteenth century and was later followed by his family. In interviews with members of the Lebanese community, anthropologist Luz María Martínez Montiel notes that ‘‘they arrived bearing relics they had brought from the Holy Land. Their oriental attire was looked upon admiringly. People here [in Mexico] kissed their hands and garments, and on learning that they came from the East, would ask them for news of the family of Jesus Christ.’’ 33 The Raful family exchanged rosaries and cruciﬁxes they had brought for pens, threads, knives, and cloth, and they used earnings from the sales of relics with glass, hardware, cutlery, perfume, and toys. Once they had developed a clientele, Middle Eastern immigrants would accumulate stock to satisfy their customers’ demands and consolidate the immigrant businesses. The immigrants’ greatest help came from friends and relatives who had already settled in Mexico.34 Some of these early immigrants capitalized on their peddling activities and expanded into other commercial ventures such as real estate and industrial production. Whether real or perceived, Middle Eastern entrepreneurship seemed to overcome the diﬃculties of the Mexican economy and thrive. The turco sojourners, these initial immigrants who quickly escaped the collapse of the Ottoman Empire with short-term goals of working and returning home, realized the need to legitimate themselves as trustworthy suppliers. They needed to market themselves and their goods for their personal safety as well as for societal acceptance. In this process, Mexican elites often found Middle Eastern immigrants a valuable resource in appeasing their workers and campesinos with goods.35 Middle Eastern immigrants oﬀered workers and campesinos new economic freedoms in their purchasing decisions through the ability to pay in installments, called abonos. Middle Eastern peddlers thus competed with a rising Mexican middle class, which became increasingly frustrated by Middle Eastern economic strategies. Letters written by Mexican merchants to the various presiden-\n\nLocating Middle Easterners 31\n\ntial administrations in the 1920s and 1930s complaining of unscrupulous Middle Eastern merchants manifest these frustrations, as will be examined further in Chapter 4. These letters helped to initiate anti-immigrant legislation and raise issues of who could be members of the Mexican nation. They also locate Middle Eastern immigrants in the historical record.\n\nMexico Becomes the Back Door to the United States As Latin American countries struggled to handle their foreign populations, the United States became increasingly concerned about controlling diseases associated with immigrants. From 1879 to 1883 the U.S. National Board of Health was established to support state and local health eﬀorts, but the feeble agency never imposed national quarantine standards to suppress diseases. Some immigrant smuggling rings began to see Mexico as ‘‘America’s ‘back door,’ ’’ 36 a place from which immigrants could slip through a porous border. In March 1891 a U.S. federal immigration law known as the Disease Act required that steamship companies medically examine emigrants to certify their health prior to their departure.37 Alan Kraut notes that with the passage of the Disease Act of March 3, 1891, ‘‘the federal government acted decisively to exclude diseases borne on the bodies of immigrants.’’ 38 This law meant that immigrants would undergo health inspections before departures and upon arrival in the United States. More speciﬁcally, steamship companies were required to certify the health of their passengers prior to departure and were liable for the cost of housing and feeding passengers that were detained by American authorities. To maintain their customer base, steamship companies began to actively use Veracruz as an alternate port of entry. Upon entering Mexico, Middle Eastern immigrants could travel to Ciudad Juárez and then enter the United States at El Paso, Texas, or other border towns. The U.S. Disease Act of 1891 revolutionized migratory patterns from the Middle East to the Americas. The health standard barred previously legal entries into the United States, prompting corruption and new entrepreneurial migration patterns. Savvy immigrants, steamship agents, and doctors quickly learned ways to evade immigration laws intended to exclude diseased immigrants such as those with the contagious bacterial eye disease commonly known as trachoma. Trachoma aﬄicted many immigrants coming to the Americas because of its prevalence in areas of overcrowding and poor hygiene and because it is passed to others by hands, on clothing, or by ﬂies that are attracted\n\n32\n\nLocating Middle Easterners\n\nto faces and runny noses.39 Cramped steamships and entrepots were prime locations for the disease to spread. And as trachoma became a concern among U.S. immigration oﬃcials in the late nineteenth century, more stringent regulations became instituted to stop the ﬂow of diseased immigrants. Nayan Shah also has suggested that the U.S. Public Health Service more frequently diagnosed Middle Eastern and Asian immigrants with trachoma than the European immigrants because of racial bias.40 In 1905 the Annual Report of the U.S. Commissioner-General of Immigration to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor noted: In Marseilles [France], the ‘‘treatment’’ of trachoma has assumed quite remarkable dimensions. Here most of the emigrants from the Orient, from Syria, Armenia, etc., come on their way to the United States. Most of the Orientals report to one Anton Fares, who refers them to a boarding house. After the usual preliminaries, such as inquiries as to the amount of money in their possession, their destination, etc., the emigrants are referred to Doctor Reynaut for examination. Those who are found free from contagious disease are given tickets and at once sent to Havre. As is well known, these races are especially prone to trachoma and in a large proportion of instances the doctor does discover its presence. These are given by M. Fares the choice of two alternatives: Either to go via St. Nazaire to Mexico, where Fares claims to have agents to conduct them across the frontier to the United States, which is quite expensive and tedious process, and of late very uncertain, or submit to a course of treatment by Dr. G. Reynaut, 20 Boulevard d’Athénee, Marseilles, who claims to have been very successful.41\n\nReynaut charged one franc per treatment, and the average duration of treatment was about two weeks. However, not all of Reynaut’s patients did in fact have trachoma. Rather they were people with money who were diagnosed with ‘‘curable’’ trachoma. After a period of treatment and boarding, these individuals were certiﬁed as ‘‘cured’’ and easily passed into the United States. Syrian immigrants convinced of Reynaut’s abilities and Fare’s connections became excellent advertisers among the Middle Eastern community. As Middle Easterners anxiously waited to cross the Atlantic and U.S. immigration policies became more stringent, Mexico emerged as a host of undocumented immigrants seeking to enter the United States. The concerns about trachoma and diseased immigrants illegally entering the United States led to an undercover investigation, which was conducted in late 1906\n\nLocating Middle Easterners 33\n\nby U.S. Inspector A. Seraphic. On October 16, 1906, A. Seraphic was given ‘‘conﬁdential instructions’’ in Washington, D.C., by the Bureau of Immigration to ‘‘proceed to the Republic of Mexico and investigate the Syrian Immigration to the United States through the Republic of Mexico in all its phases as well as the conditions at the Border stations.’’ 42 His report reveals a complex, well-coordinated smuggling ring that began in France and brought immigrants to Mexico who would otherwise be denied admission into the United States. These immigrants would then cross the U.S.-Mexican border at towns such as El Paso and Brownsville. The report documents the ease of crossing the U.S.-Mexican border for Mexicans and for Middle Eastern immigrants. As the Seraphic report reveals, immigrants were coached to ‘‘become Mexican’’ in order to more easily enter the United States. Posing as Mexicans, Syrians and in some cases Greeks who were able to ‘‘dress Mexican’’ and pretend to be drunk could bypass poorly paid inspection oﬃcials. One informant told a disguised Seraphic, ‘‘let him walk across briskly and say he is Mexican.’’ 43 In examining the comparable case of the Chinese immigrants seeking to cross the border, Grace Delgado notes that ‘‘two Chinese women adorned themselves in the customary dark veils garnished by Mexican women of the time.’’ 44 Responding to such practices, Commissioner-General F. P. Sargent complained that the inspectors at the El Paso bridge ‘‘apparently pay but little attention to persons having the appearance of being Mexicans, which has led to that form of disguise being adopted by aliens of other nationalities who are desirous of ﬁnding an easy means of ingress to this country [the United States].’’ 45 Sargent then contacted the San Antonio oﬃce and stated: It would appear that the dress and appearance of a Mexican is about all that is needed for any European alien, regardless of his condition, to secure admission through that port . . . It is further shown that there is a small boat plying regularly between Eagle Pass and the Mexican shore, carrying passengers who are passed with no further examination than that of an inspector stationed on the bridge, who contents himself with looking at the passengers going back and forth on the boat.46\n\nAccording to ins records, several smuggling operations existed to facilitate a growing market demand to bring relatives to the United States. The smugglers operated throughout Mexico in Tampico, Veracruz, Mexico City, Monterrey, Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, Ciudad Juárez, and Torreón. In Veracruz, Syrian immigrant Nicolás Homsey, for example, ran a dry goods store and restaurant with some ‘‘ﬁlthy’’ rooms for arriving compa-\n\n34\n\nLocating Middle Easterners\n\ntriots. When there were not enough beds to accommodate the immigrants, they would sleep in empty lots or near the docks in front of the U.S. Consulate. Homsey would charge the Syrian immigrants $1.00 to $1.50 per day for board and lodging and $2.00 each for his services in buying them tickets and acting as an interpreter for them. Seraphic describes Homsey as a grafter of the ﬁrst degree and a combination exists between him and Geo. Roume and Mitri Assi of Marseilles, who are the principal steerers of Syrian Immigration to the United States through Mexico. The combination extends to Mexico City with the Hotel keepers and to Monterey [sic] and Torreon with dry goods merchants.47\n\nAccording to the report, French and German steamers had brought about two hundred Syrians to Mexico, of whom 40 percent left for the Yucatán via steamships and eighty were found in Homsey’s house. Although Nicolás Homsey and other merchants in Mexico City, Monterrey, and Torreón appeared to be helping Syrian immigrants get to the United States, Seraphic contends that in fact they were putting up every possible obstacle to induce these immigrants to stay in Mexico. With more Syrian peddlers in Mexico employed by store-owning countrymen, there was greater market coverage and therefore an increased opportunity for proﬁt. For example, many of the immigrants leaving from Europe to Veracruz intended to make it to the United States; they were told in France that railway tickets from Veracruz to New York were only sixteen dollars, and these immigrants got the idea that they could cure their cases of trachoma in Mexico before entering the United States. Once in Veracruz, however, and if they had money, Homsey suggested that they proceed to Yucatán where, after six more months, they could proceed to New York by steamer. Apparently, U.S. inspectors were not as strict on steamships arriving from Mexico as they were with steamships coming from Europe. Those Syrian immigrants who arrived without money in Mexico began peddling in Veracruz or were sent to Mexico City by friends or relatives. Selim Almshiti was the ‘‘chief immigrant robber in Mexico City, after Nicolas Homsey has divested them of as much cash as he can through himself and some of his agents who work for him.’’ 48 Seraphic notes that ‘‘deported immigrants cannot get back at them for false guarantees and representations.’’ 49 These immigrants had no recourse. The human smuggling ring operating in Mexico to serve and exploit Syrian immigrants acted with impunity. One extreme case involved Aziz Barondi, who was known to collect full\n\nLocating Middle Easterners 35\n\nfares to El Paso from immigrants in Mexico City and purchase transportation for them only to Torreón. Barondi and his colleagues also would exchange money for the immigrants at much less than the prevailing rates. For immigrants going to Mexico City from coastal ports, Syrian handlers greeted them at the train station and escorted them to ﬁve places —Josi Ali y Selim Abdalla, Correo Mayor No. 1; Ayar Assad, Meleros No. 1; Rashid Galahon, Correo Mayor No. 7; Youseﬀ Simaan, Avenida Oriente No. 1; Manuel Daraskoui and Selim Amshiti Yousef, Rejas de Valvanera No. 5. Immigrants often slept on the ﬂoor and were packed like sardines. One or two rooms were converted into a restaurant in which immigrants could sleep and eat. Although these ﬁlthy places further spread trachoma and other contagious diseases, they also served as places to coach immigrants as to what to say during inspection at the U.S.-Mexican border. Meanwhile, as immigrants waited for remittances from relatives in the States, they would begin peddling goods for their countrymen who owned stores in Mexico. There were reportedly 900 Syrians living in Mexico City in 1906 whose chief occupation was peddling. Seraphic reported: The Syrians endeavor to, and succeed very readily in becoming Mexicanized. They dress in Mexican attire while peddling through Mexico and they show great aptitude in learning Spanish. Their mode of life in Syria is not dissimilar to that of the low Mexican and as both the Arabic and Spanish abound in insincere expressions of politeness, bordering on servility, they assimilate with Mexicans easier than all other races.50\n\nAlthough the Middle Easterners had a propensity for integration into Mexican society, many still wished to immigrate to the United States to join family members and friends. If immigrants were able to save enough from peddling or receive suﬃcient remittances from friends or relatives in Mexico City, they would travel to one of the border cities and try to enter the United States. Many immigrants traveled to other Latin American destinations and then similarly tried to enter the United States. Immigrant Fares Nasser of St. Louis, Missouri, told immigration oﬃcials in August 1906 that he traveled from Marseilles to Buenos Aires because his brother lived in Buenos Aires. Nasser then left Buenos Aires for Veracruz and then Mexico City. From Mexico City, he traveled to El Paso and crossed the border with nine other immigrants with the assistance of Alexander Hakeem, whom he paid two dollars.51 The Mexican Herald published an article in July 1906 with the headline ‘‘Thousands of Turks: Immigrants of this Class Arriving at Veracruz.’’\n\n36 Locating Middle Easterners\n\nThe article began, ‘‘Three special cars were attached to the regular Mexican train from Veracruz yesterday morning on account of a large number of Turkish immigrants brought to that port by the German steamer which arrived there Thursday.’’ 52 A Spanish steamer also brought a large inﬂux of immigrants. It was estimated that more than 450 immigrants from both steamers arrived in Veracruz. Some of the immigrants stayed in the vicinity to secure work, and others would ‘‘eventually work their way to the border and cross into the United States.’’ 53 In December 1906 the San Antonio Express commented that ‘‘while Mexico wants immigrants, nevertheless, she does not want any more than does the United States the objectionable classes.’’ 54 In Ciudad Juárez, an active smuggling ring included a medical inspector, Dr. Coﬃn; a translator, Salim Mattar; and customs oﬃcials. When word leaked that A. Seraphic was not in fact an undocumented Syrian immigrant trying to cross the U.S.-Mexican border with a pregnant cousin but rather an undercover investigator from the Immigration Service, accusations began to ﬂy. Unfortunately, only Seraphic’s account survives in the historical record. As with drug traﬃcking rings, the total number and scope of human smuggling rings are diﬃcult to document. In Ciudad Juárez, Seraphic noted that Kalil Koury of El Paso was the main contact for Syrian immigrants seeking to cross the U.S. border. Koury had adobe houses with about ten rooms in total, and the immigrants huddled together on muddy ﬂoors without any bedding or cover ‘‘in a condition that Mexican peons do not care to reside in.’’ 55 After charging each immigrant various fees for boarding, transportation pick-up and drop-oﬀ, Koury would then take the immigrants to Dr. Coﬃn’s treating day. Dr. Cofﬁn, wrote Seraphic, was the man who ‘‘monopolizes the treatment of Syrian trachomatous eyes.’’ For twenty dollars, Dr. Coﬃn would guarantee the cure of trachoma and would employ the following procedure: A Syrian to open the eye of each patient and two drops of a solution of nitrate silver in the eye constituted all the patients received. Every three days one of each treatment or ten a month, but usually eight. This with the payment of $20 cash is a positive guarantee to cure every case in a month.56\n\nHowever, as of January 1907 Dr. Coﬃn was to raise his fee to twenty-ﬁve dollars per cure. On treatment day, Koury would pull out a book reminding the doctor of which immigrants were cured or not, and then the doctor would write out a certiﬁcate saying: ‘‘This is to certify that I have treated\n\nLocating Middle Easterners 37\n\nbearer for one month, and he is now cured (Sgd.) C.W. Coﬃn.’’ Coﬃn would agree to certify four immigrants in one day.57 However, Koury would sometimes lie about the date of the certiﬁcate, forcing the immigrants to stay for additional nights at his boarding home and to incur more debt. Meanwhile at the El Paso inspection station, Seraphic suggests, Dr. Sinks, the medical inspector, was connected to Dr. Coﬃn and was in fact taking kickbacks for admitting ‘‘cured’’ immigrants. According to the report, Dr. Coﬃn and Dr. Sinks formerly had their oﬃces together, and their families were very close. ‘‘Dr. Sinks pointed out Dr. Coﬃn to Kalil Koury to treat the Syrians. He has a monopoly of it, netting from $600 to $1,000 per month. All that are treated by Dr. Coﬃn, Dr. Sinks passes.’’ 58 In a seeming grudge against Dr. Sinks, Seraphic goes as far as approaching the former Mrs. Sinks for additional information. However, Seraphic was not able to obtain suﬃcient evidence to warrant Dr. Sinks’ dismissal; rather, Seraphic advised that Sinks be transferred.59 While making accusations against the medical inspectors in El Paso in 1906, Seraphic also investigated an interpreter, Salim Mattar, for charging immigrants additional fees for translation. Mattar was employed by the federal government to translate for inspection oﬃcials. When Seraphic approached the Santa Fe, G.H. and S.A., and Rock Island railroad ticket agents about Mattar, they all stated that they never paid any commission to the interpreter. Rather, Seraphic suggested, Mattar and Koury were partners who defrauded immigrants. Mattar had helped Koury get started in his business in Ciudad Juárez. In El Paso, Mattar had a Turkish bazaar that paid him well. In the end, Seraphic’s main complaint against Mattar was that he was not proﬁcient in English.60 The U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor also took note of Kalil Koury. In 1907 the department reported that Abraham Assad, a Turk of Syrian race, entered the United States in violation of the Act of Congress approved March 3, 1903. After being rejected at El Paso as suﬀering from trachoma, Abraham Assad was smuggled into the United States by Kalil Koury.61 Koury, known for his famous immigrant boardinghouse in Ciudad Juárez, was reported to have smuggled at least 500 Syrians into the United States in 1906. Salim Mattar, who worked at El Paso inspections, apparently aided Assad in obtaining"
