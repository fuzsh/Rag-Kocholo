Cabral\n\nCabral, Amílcar (Lopes) (b. Sept. 12, 1924, Bafatá, Portuguese Guinea - d. Jan. 20, 1973, Conakry, Guinea), Guinea-Bissau politician. Already determined to find ways of working for his country's independence, he served for two years in the colonial administration of Portuguese Guinea. His opinions became offensive to the governor of the colony, and Cabral transferred to Angola. There, late in 1956, he helped to form, with Agostinho Neto, the earliest important nationalist grouping of that colony, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). A few months earlier, during a visit to Bissau, he also formed with five others the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde; PAIGC) and became its secretary-general. This small clandestine grouping pressed for political concessions by organizing strikes and demonstrations, but decided in September 1959, after the particularly violent repression of a strike in the Bissau docks, to prepare for armed action. It was from this period that Cabral began to demonstrate the personal qualities of patience, courage, and political farsightedness which were soon to make him, as well as the movement that he led, into a most formidable opponent of continued Portuguese colonial rule. The armed uprising of the PAIGC was launched in January 1963 and survived all Portuguese efforts at repression. In the late 1960s Cabral was the de facto ruler of the parts of Portuguese Guinea not occupied by army units from Portugal. In 1972 he established a Guinean People's National Assembly as a step toward independence. He was assassinated outside his home in Conakry, where his party had established its headquarters.\n\nCabral, Filomeno da Câmara Melo (b. March 10, 1873, Ponta Delgada, Azores, Portugal - d.

He served on PAIGC's Council of War from 1965 and took part in the guerrilla struggle. He was placed in charge of the reconstruction of liberated areas in Guinea-Bissau in 1970. By 1972 the PAIGC claimed to have won control over two-thirds of the country. Luís Cabral succeeded as PAIGC's leader following Amílcar's assassination on Jan. 20, 1973. He served as head of state after Guinea-Bissau's self-proclaimed independence from Sept. 26, 1973, acknowledged by Portugal the following year.

Despite his occasional disputes with Salazar, he wholeheartedly supported the latter's right-wing policies. When Salazar suffered a stroke in 1968, Caetano was appointed prime minister. He admitted an opposition and rectified the constitution. While Salazar rarely moved from Lisbon, Caetano made frequent trips abroad - to Africa, Latin America, the United States, and Europe.

The major part of the armed forces were engaged in policing the colonies and fighting guerrilla wars at an enormous cost to the nation. World opinion was against colonialism and there was universal concern at reports in 1973 that Portuguese troops had massacred 400 in Mozambique. Dissatisfaction in the army led to the \"Revolution of the Flowers,\" which in 1974 overthrew the New State and drove Caetano into exile.

In Congress, he was active in passage of the Civil Rights Act as a member of the House Judiciary Committee. He was a liberal Republican, pro-union and active in urban causes. He once singled out Richard Nixon for not paying more attention to domestic problems such as the urban decay affecting Newark. Cahill broke with fellow Republicans at times, praising students who protested Nixon's decision to invade Cambodia during the Vietnam War, and pushing to soften penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana. As governor, he focused on the environment (the Department of Environmental Protection was created during his term), raised the state sales tax from 3% to 5% to balance the budget shortly after taking office, and also presided over introduction of a state lottery. But he lost an attempt to get voter approval of a state income tax recommended by a commission he had appointed.

He had to resign as finance minister in 1914 after his wife assassinated the editor of the Figaro, Gaston Calmette, who had led a press campaign against him. She was subsequently acquitted. During World War I he was himself arrested because of his advocacy of a negotiated peace; he was convicted in 1920 for wartime communication with the enemy and deprived of political rights for 10 years. Following an amnesty he returned to politics in 1925.\n\nCain, Herman (b. Dec. 13, 1945, Memphis, Tenn. - d. July 30, 2020, Atlanta area, Ga.), U.S. politician.

Oct. 29, 1946), administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory (1992-94).\n\nCairns, Hugh McCalmont Cairns, (1st) Earl (b. Dec. 27, 1819 - d. April 2, 1885, Bournemouth, Dorset, England), British lord chancellor (1868, 1874-80). He was also solicitor general (1858-59) and attorney general (1866). He was created Baron Cairns in 1867 and Earl Cairns and Viscount Garmoyle in 1878.\n\nJ. Cairns\n\nCairns, Jim, byname of James Ford Cairns (b. Oct. 4, 1914, Carlton, near Melbourne, Vic. - d. Oct. 12, 2003, Narre Warren East, near Melbourne), Australian politician. He entered federal politics as the member for Yarra in 1955. He played a large role in keeping Catholic anti-Communists within the Victorian Labor Party at bay. He rose through the ranks particularly by his anti-Vietnam War stance. While the Labor Party remained ambivalent in the early years of the war, Cairns was quick to denounce Australia's strong support for the United States. It culminated in him leading huge antiwar marches, and in Labor's decision to oppose conscription and the war. He also opposed the White Australia policy. His strong position also aroused anger and in 1969 he and his family were bashed in their home, one of his attackers saying, \"Who do you think you are - God?\" Cairns took months to recover. He was defeated for the party leadership in 1966 when Arthur Calwell was replaced by Gough Whitlam as leader. Two years later, when Whitlam resigned the leadership in an internal squabble, Cairns lost again, falling six votes short of Whitlam. When Labor gained power in 1972 with Whitlam at the helm, Cairns was made trade and secondary industry minister. Among his achievements was a trade deal with China and closer links with the Middle East. Following the economic problems that confounded the government, he was made treasurer and deputy prime minister in 1974. In 1975, he was sacked as treasurer for allegedly misleading parliament over his involvement in overseas loan-raising, but within Labor the move was seen as punishment for an improper relationship with his office coordinator Junie Morosi. He spent a short period as environment minister before the Whitlam government was swept from office in 1975. In 1977 he retired.\n\nCairns, Sir William Wellington (b. 1828, Ireland - d.

Aug. 10, 1963, Istanbul, Turkey), defense minister of Turkey (1948-50). He was also governor of Gaziantep (1922-25), Ordu (1925), and Tokat (1925-26) and minister of economy (1938-41).\n\nÇakmak\n\nÇakmak, (Mustafa) Fevzi, until Jan. 1, 1935, Mustafa Fevzi Pasha (b. Jan. 12, 1876, Istanbul - d. April 10, 1950, Istanbul), Turkish politician. A lieutenant in 1895, he was made lieutenant colonel and appointed chief of staff of an army corps in 1910. He fought in the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 as commander of a division, and in World War I as commander of an army corps and (in 1917-18) of an army. War minister in 1920, he resigned the commission and office granted him by the sultan and joined Kemal Atatürk's \"rebellion\" in Ankara. There he was made prime minister and minister of defense. Promoted to the rank of full general during the Greek invasion of Anatolia, he resigned his premiership in 1922 and became deputy to Ismet Inönü, then chief of staff. After the victorious conclusion of the War of Liberation, he was promoted as the new republic's first marshal and appointed chief of staff, holding this position for 20 years. With Atatürk and Inönü, he was one of the three statesmen who created modern Turkey. In the 1946 elections he stood as an independent and was elected with a great majority. In 1948 he accepted the honorary leadership of the Nation's (conservative) Party.\n\nÇakmakoglu, Sabahattin (b. Nov. 25, 1930, Incesu, Kayseri, Turkey), interior minister (1991) and defense minister (1999-2002) of Turkey. He was also governor of Gümüshane (1972-75), Isparta (1975-78), Edirne (1978), Gaziantep (1979-80), and Mersin (1984-88).\n\nCakobau, Ratu Sir Edward (Tuivanuavou Tugi), Edward also spelled Etuate (b. Dec. 21, 1908, Bau, Fiji - d. June 25, 1973, Suva, Fiji), Fijian politician; knighted 1971; son of George Tupou II; great-grandson of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau. He was minister of commerce, industry, and labour (1967-72) and deputy prime minister (1972-73).\n\nCakobau, Ratu Sir George (Kadavulevu), Vunivalu of Bau (b. Nov. 6, 1912, Bau island, Fiji - d. Nov. 25, 1989, Suva, Fiji), governor-general of Fiji (1973-83); knighted 1973; great-grandson of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau. He was the first Fijian nobleman to be sent abroad for his education, studying in Australia and New Zealand. During World War II he served with distinction as an officer in the Fiji Military Forces fighting the Japanese in the Pacific islands. He was installed as Vunivalu, the traditional paramount chief, in 1959. Deeply attached to everything British, he was widely believed to be opposed to independence from Britain. But the large Indian population of the islands, outnumbering native Fijians, won the day. He served as minister for Fijian affairs and local government in 1970-71. In 1973, three years after independence, he became the first locally-born governor-general. In 1987 he received newly elected prime minister Timoci Bavadra, indicating his support for the new interracial government. He remained largely silent in the wake of the two military coups that followed in 1987, and the establishment of a republic in Fiji by military decree and the consequent severance of those links with the crown which he so cherished. However, when in March 1988 Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, without apparently consulting Cakobau beforehand, set off for London to try to persuade the queen to retain the title of Tui Viti which was passed to Queen Victoria in 1874, Cakobau was outraged, saying, \"The title came back to me when Fiji became independent in 1970. I have no plans to abdicate. The title is not Ratu Mara's to give away.\"\n\nCakobau, Ratu Seru Epenisa (b. 1815, Lakeba island, Fiji - d. February 1883), ruler (Vunivalu) of Bau (1852-74), president of the General Assembly of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Viti (1865-67), king of Bau (1867-69) and of Viti (1871-74). He embraced Christianity and later led chiefs across the island group to cede sovereignty to Queen Victoria and become part of the British Empire in 1874, thus ending years of bloody tribal warfare.\n\nCakste, Janis (b. Sept. 14, 1859, Lielsesava, Russia [now in Latvia] - d. March 14, 1927, Riga, Latvia), president of Latvia (1922-25, 1925-27). He edited a Latvian newspaper, Tevija (\"Fatherland\"), served on a committee appointed by the local administration to inquire into agricultural conditions in Courland (1902), and was frequently a member of Russian imperial government committees. He was elected to the first Russian Duma (assembly) in March 1906, and was one of those who signed the Viborg protest against its dissolution in July, losing his political privileges in consequence. When the German invasion of Courland (July 1915) in World War I obliged him to leave Jelgava, he moved to Petrograd, where he was one of the founders of the Latvian Refugees Committee, which, in addition to its relief work, supported Latvian autonomy. He went to Stockholm in 1916 to promote the cause of Latvian independence and wrote Die Letten und ihre Latwija (1917; \"The Letts and Their Latvia\"). Elected chairman of the Latvian People's Council in 1918, he was later the head of the delegation sent to London and to the Paris Peace Conference to secure the recognition of the Latvian republic. While he was absent on that mission, Cakste was elected president of the People's Council (1918); he was later elected president of the Constitutional Assembly (1920) and, when the first Saeima (parliament) convened, president of the Republic of Latvia (Nov. 14, 1922). He was reelected in November 1925 and died in office.\n\nCalasans, João José de Bittencourt (b. June 12, 1811, Santa Luzia [now Santa Luzia do Itanhi], Sergipe, Brazil - d.

Dec. 24, 2009, Caracas, Venezuela), president of Venezuela (1969-74, 1994-99). He entered politics in the 1930s, and in 1946 founded the Social-Christian COPEI party, a movement grounded in the middle class. He helped revive democracy as one of the three signers of the Punto Fijo pact, which organized elections after the fall of dictator Gen. Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958. Under the pact, COPEI and Rómulo Betancourt's Democratic Action party shared power for 40 years. Viewed by many as the grandfather of Venezuelan politics, Caldera ran in six presidential elections and won twice, in 1969 and 1993. Tough with political adversaries and inclined toward populism, he was also known for living simply and for integrity in a country where corruption was common. Caldera's supporters said his second term, during which he grew increasingly frail to the point of infirmity, brought relative political stability to Venezuela. The country had been buffeted by 1989 price riots, two 1992 military coup attempts, and the 1993 dismissal of a president who later was tried and convicted on corruption charges. Caldera's critics argued that he fell short on his promises to restructure and modernize an inefficient state apparatus. They noted that he presided over two devaluations in three years and left Latin America's fourth-largest economy in deep recession. In 1994, Caldera pardoned Hugo Chávez, who was jailed for leading one of the failed coups two years earlier. But Caldera was later deeply at odds with Chávez, who came to succeed him as president.\n\nN.J. Caldera\n\nF. Calderón\n\nCaldera Cardenal, Norman José (b.

He was also minister to the United States (1899-1900).\n\nCalderón, Erasmo, interior and justice minister of Nicaragua (1896-98).\n\nCalderón (Hinojosa), Felipe (de Jesús) (b. Aug. 18, 1962, Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico), president of Mexico (2006-12). His father, Luis Calderón Vega, had been among the founding members of the pro-business National Action Party (PAN) in 1939. From a young age Felipe Calderón helped in political campaigns. He rose through the ranks of PAN, becoming the leader of its youth movement in 1986 and then secretary-general (1993-95) and president (1996-99) of the party. Meanwhile he was elected to the legislative assembly of the Distrito Federal (1988-91) and to the federal Chamber of Deputies (1991-94). He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michoacán in 1995. Returning to the Chamber of Deputies in 2000, he was designated as coordinator of the PAN parliamentary group. Vicente Fox, the first PAN candidate to be elected president of Mexico (2000-06), named him director-general of the national development bank (Banobras) in 2003 and then appointed him to the cabinet as energy minister (2003-04). Calderón unexpectedly ran for the PAN presidential nomination in the 2005 primaries and defeated Fox's preferred candidate, Santiago Creel. In the presidential election of July 2, 2006, Calderón finished first with 35.9% of the vote, leading Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), by a mere 0.6% of the vote. López Obrador refused to concede the election, demanded a full recount, and initiated a series of massive street demonstrations that continued for weeks. After a partial recount, the Federal Electoral Tribunal declared Calderón president-elect on September 5. Calderón was inaugurated in the Congress building on December 1, while PRD legislators blew whistles in the chamber and up to 100,000 protesters demonstrated outside. The following week - in an effort to undermine López Obrador's support by appropriating his key issues - he announced plans to reduce salaries for himself and other top government officials and to increase spending for education, health insurance for the poor, housing, and public safety. He oversaw the passage of legislation to reform Mexico's judicial system and worked to strengthen the energy sector, increase the number of jobs, and fight crime and drug cartels. But drug-related violence only got worse, some 60,000 people being killed during his presidency.\n\nCalderón, Pedro José (b. 1832, Lima, Peru - d. 1885), foreign minister (1864-65, 1879-81) and prime minister (1865) of Peru. He was also minister to Germany and Austria-Hungary (1871-72).\n\nCalderón (Chirinos), Serapio (b. Sept. 14, 1843, Paucartambo, Cusco, Peru - d.

Calderón\n\nCalderón (Serra de Cantero Frau), Sila María (b. Sept. 23, 1942, San Juan, Puerto Rico), governor of Puerto Rico (2001-05). When Luis Silva Recio, a former professor of Calderón's, was chosen as Puerto Rico's secretary of labour in 1973, she became his executive assistant. In 1984 she served as the special assistant to Gov. Rafael Hernández Colón, who the following year appointed her chief of staff, and she then served as secretary of the interior before becoming secretary of state in 1988. She was elected mayor of San Juan in 1996 and was later chosen as head of the Popular Democratic Party. In the 1998 referendum on statehood organized by pro-statehood governor Pedro Rosselló, she led the pro-commonwealth campaign; her efforts were rewarded when the majority voted in favour of commonwealth status. In running for governor in 2000, she promised to end corruption and the U.S. Navy's bombing exercises on Vieques, an island off the east coast of the main island of Puerto Rico that had been used for naval exercises since 1941. Her strong antibombing stance, plus the killing of a security officer by an errant bomb in 1999 and the island's alarmingly high cancer rate (which many attributed to the exercises), brought her the victory. Immediately after her inauguration she vowed to step up efforts to end the military use of the island. On April 24, 2001, she launched legal action against the U.S. government, basing the suit on the Noise Control Act of 1972. Although U.S. president George W. Bush initially resisted ending the exercises, in June his administration announced that the bombings would be permanently halted in 2003. Having divorced her longtime husband Adolfo Krans soon after taking office, she married her former secretary of economic development, Ramón Cantero Frau, in 2003.\n\nCalderón (Reyes), Víctor (b. 1867, Santa Rosa de Viterbo, Boyacá, Colombia - d. 1909, Bogotá, Colombia), war minister of Colombia (1908-09); half-brother of Clímaco Calderón.\n\nCalderón Berti, Humberto (b.

Oct. 8, 1979, Murici, Alagoas, Brazil), governor of Alagoas (2015-22); son of Renan Calheiros. He has also been Brazilian minister of transport (2023- ).\n\nCalheiros, (José) Renan (Vasconcelos) (b. Sept. 16, 1955, Murici, Alagoas, Brazil), justice minister of Brazil (1998-99). He was also president of the Senate (2005-07, 2013-17).\n\nCalhoun, James M. (b. Feb. 12, 1811, Abbeville county, S.C. - d. Oct. 1, 1875, Atlanta, Ga.), mayor of Atlanta (1862-65); cousin of John C. Calhoun.\n\nCalhoun, James S(ilas) (b. 1802, Georgia? - d. July 2, 1852, near Independence, Mo.), governor of New Mexico (1851-52).\n\nCalhoun, John C(aldwell) (b. March 18, 1782, near Calhoun Mills [now Mount Carmel], S.C. - d. March 31, 1850, Washington, D.C.), U.S. secretary of war (1817-25), vice president (1825-32), and secretary of state (1844-45). He was elected to South Carolina's state legislature in 1808 and the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. There he soon became acting chairman of the committee on foreign affairs, supported the measures which led to the War of 1812 (1812-15) with Great Britain, and promoted the protective tariff. In 1817 he joined Pres. James Monroe's cabinet and reorganized the War Department. He eagerly sought the presidency for himself but was never successful, becoming, however, vice president under both John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. His Address to the People of South Carolina (1831) set forth his theory of state rights. On the passing by South Carolina in 1832 of the nullification ordinance he resigned the vice presidency, and entered the Senate, becoming a leader of the states-rights movement, working to unite the South against the abolitionist attack on slavery, an institution he defended as a \"positive good.\" Resigning from the Senate in 1843, he became secretary of state under Pres. John Tyler in 1844, in which role he signed a treaty annexing Texas. Elected to the Senate again in 1845, he strenuously opposed the Mexican War of 1846-47. His last effort was a vigorous protest against the Compromise of 1850, introduced by Henry Clay to avert a crisis between North and South. Calhoun, Clay, and Daniel Webster were known as the \"great triumvirate\" of U.S. political orators.\n\nCalhoun, William Lowndes (b. Nov. 21, 1837, Decatur, Ga. - d. Nov. 16, 1908, Atlanta, Ga.), mayor of Atlanta (1879-80); son of James M. Calhoun.\n\nCalifice, Alfred (b. Oct. 2, 1916, Melen [now part of Soumagne], Liége [now Liège] province, Belgium - d.

He was minister of public works (1973-74), employment, labour, Walloon affairs, regional planning, and housing (1974-77), social security (1977-80), pensions (1979-80), and public health and environment (1980).\n\nCaliguiri, Richard S. (b. Oct. 20, 1931, Pittsburgh, Pa. - d. May 6, 1988, Pittsburgh), mayor of Pittsburgh (1977-88).\n\nÇalik, (Ahmet) Rifat, until Jan. 1, 1935, Rifat Bey (b. 1888, Kayseri, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey] - d. Feb. 23, 1963), justice minister of Turkey (1922-23). He was also mayor of Kayseri (1924-25).\n\nCalimachi-Catargi, Nicolae, also spelled Calimachi-Catargiu (b. Feb. 3, 1831 [or Feb. 24, 1830], Iasi, Moldavia [now in Romania] - d. Feb. 9, 1882, Paris, France), foreign minister of Romania (1869-70, 1870-71). He was also diplomatic agent to France (1877-80) and the United Kingdom (1880-81).\n\nCalinescu, Armand (Mihai) (b. June 3 [May 22, O.S.], 1893, Pitesti, Romania - d. Sept. 21, 1939, Bucharest, Romania), prime minister of Romania (1939). He was an organizer for the National Peasant Party and in 1919 entered on a public political career as general secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1926 he was elected to parliament. In 1930 he was made undersecretary of state of the Ministry of the Interior. In December 1937 he became minister of interior in the National Christian cabinet of Octavian Goga. In February 1938 Romania was on the verge of serious disturbances, and Calinescu told King Carol that he could not guarantee the maintenance of order during the elections which were about to be held as the anti-Semitic partisans of Alexandru C. Cuza had gotten out of hand in the provinces. On the other hand, the Iron Guard, an equally anti-Semitic and conspiratorial body guilty of a long list of political assassinations, seemed almost certain to be returned in such a strength as to entitle it to office. King Carol dismissed Goga, entrusting the formation of a new cabinet to the Orthodox patriarch Miron Cristea. Calinescu remained interior minister and became in fact the driving force of the government, carrying on the fight against the Iron Guards, bringing them up to trial and subsequently obtaining from the courts heavy sentences on their leaders. When Cristea's health failed, Calinescu was appointed vice premier and war minister, and he became premier on the patriarch's death (March 1939). He was one of the sponsors of the Romanian National Renaissance Front, aiming at uniting in one group all the Romanian political parties. But his plans were cut short when he was assassinated by Guardist terrorists.\n\nCall, Guillermo (Antonio) (b. March 11, 1940), governor of Monagas (1986-87, 1989-95, 2000-04).\n\nCall, Richard K(eith) (b. Oct. 24, 1792, Prince George county, Va. - d. Sept. 14, 1862, Tallahassee, Fla.), governor of Florida (1836-39, 1841-44).\n\nCallaghan, Jeremiah Thomas Fitzgerald (b. Dec. 27, 1827, Midleton, County Cork, Ireland - d. July 9, 1881), governor of Labuan (1861-66), the Falkland Islands (1876-80), and the Bahamas (1880-81) and administrator of Gambia (1871-72).\n\nCallaghan\n\nCallaghan of Cardiff, (Leonard) James Callaghan, Baron (b. March 27, 1912, Portsmouth, Hampshire, England - d. March 26, 2005, Ringmer, East Sussex, England), prime minister of the United Kingdom (1976-79). By 1936 he had become a full-time trade-union official. He entered Parliament in 1945, representing the Welsh constituency of Cardiff South. Between 1947 and 1951 Callaghan held junior posts at the Ministry of Transport and at the Admiralty. When Harold Wilson's Labour government was formed in 1964, Callaghan was named chancellor of the exchequer. In this capacity he helped secure in 1966-67 international agreement to a system called Special Drawing Rights, which in effect created a new kind of international money. He resigned from the exchequer in 1967, when he was forced to devalue the pound sterling. He then served as home secretary until 1970. In Wilson's second government in 1974, Callaghan was named foreign secretary; and in 1976, upon Wilson's resignation, Callaghan succeeded him as prime minister, largely because the Parliamentary Labour Party considered him the least divisive candidate. A moderate within the party, he tried to stem the increasingly vociferous demands of Britain's trade unions. He also had to secure the passage of unpopular spending cuts early in his ministry. His reassuring public manner came to be criticized as complacency when a series of labour strikes in 1978-79 paralyzed hospital care, refuse collection, and other essential services. In March 1979 his government was brought down by a vote of no confidence passed in the House of Commons, the first such occurrence since 1924. At the subsequent general election, Labour was defeated. On Oct. 15, 1980, he resigned as party leader, to be succeeded by Michael Foot. He was knighted and shortly afterward created a life peer in 1987.\n\nCallbeck\n\nCallbeck, Catherine S(ophia) (b. July 25, 1939, Central Bedeque, P.E.I.), premier of Prince Edward Island (1993-96). Callbeck's political career began with her election to the island legislature in 1974, where she served until 1978. She was elected to parliament in 1988, but resigned in November 1992 to seek the Liberal leadership in the province, which she won in January 1993. She led the Liberals to victory in every seat but one in the March 1993 election. She became the first woman elected to lead a Canadian provincial government. (Canada's first female premier was Rita Johnston in British Columbia, who took over after a resignation but was then defeated in elections.) Callbeck, who could have remained in office until early 1998, resigned on Aug. 6, 1996. The unexpected resignation followed reports of dissension within her Liberal Party after she decided against calling an early election in June. Opposition leaders said Callbeck backed off because support for her government had fallen. Callbeck also quit the Liberal Party leadership. On Sept. 23, 1997, she was called to the Senate of Canada.\n\nCalle (Girón), Wilver (Alfredo) (b. March 1, 1946, Lima, Peru), interior minister of Peru (2012).\n\nCalle Aguas, Andrés David (b. Dec. 27, 1991, Montelíbano, Córdoba, Colombia), Colombian politician. He was president of the Chamber of Representatives (2023-24).\n\nCalle Restrepo, Diego (b. July 18, 1926, Ciudad Bolívar, Antioquia, Colombia - d. Oct. 20, 1985, Medellín, Colombia), finance minister of Colombia (1964-65). He was also ambassador to Canada (1965-66) and governor of Antioquia (1970-73).\n\nCalle y Calle, Juan José (b. March 12, 1925, Arequipa, Peru - d. 2002), Peruvian diplomat. He was ambassador to the Soviet Union (1973-79) and Spain (1986-88) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1980-82).\n\nR.L. Callejas\n\nCallejas (Romero), Rafael Leonardo (b. Nov. 14, 1943, Tegucigalpa, Honduras - d. April 4, 2020, Atlanta, Ga.), president of Honduras (1990-94); nephew of Policarpo Callejas Bonilla. He was also minister of agriculture and natural resources (1978-80). He was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1985 before winning in 1989.\n\nCallejas, Santiago, war and navy minister (1893) and finance minister (1895-96) of Nicaragua.\n\nCallejas Bonilla, Policarpo (b. Sept. 17, 1926, Tegucigalpa, Honduras - d. March 10, 2013, Tegucigalpa), Honduran diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1964-65) and ambassador to Costa Rica (1965-71).\n\nCalleri (conte) di Sala, Edoardo (b. 1927? - d. April 20, 2002, Turin, Italy), president of Piemonte (1970-73).\n\nP.E. Calles\n\nCalles, Plutarco Elías, original name Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano (b. Sept. 25, 1877, Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico - d. Oct. 19, 1945, Mexico City, Mexico), president of Mexico (1924-28). He joined the struggle of Francisco Madero against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz in 1910. Calles was an extremely gifted organizer and leader and a general in the battles, first against Victoriano Huerta, who had assassinated Madero, and then against Pancho Villa and his rebel forces. In 1917-19 (and provisionally in 1915-16) Calles was governor of Sonora. Appointed secretary of commerce, labour, and industry under Pres. Venustiano Carranza, he resigned to support the candidacy of Álvaro Obregón and was instrumental in overthrowing Carranza in 1920. Calles served as secretary of war under Adolfo de la Huerta (1920) and then as secretary of the interior under Obregón (1920-24). In 1924 Calles was elected president. Although becoming increasingly conservative, he sponsored agrarian, labour, and educational reforms. His term was marked also by difficulties with the Roman Catholic Church and the United States. President-elect Obregón was assassinated in 1928, and for the next six years Calles was the real power behind three puppet presidents, besides holding office as secretary of war (1929, 1931-32) and finance and public credit (1933-34). His base was the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR), which he organized in 1929; its support of a candidate was tantamount to election. In those six years the more radical aspects of the revolution were methodically curbed. But by 1934, left-wing groups had begun to control the PNR, and Calles had to support their candidate for president, Lázaro Cárdenas. This deteriorated into an open break, and Calles was forced into exile in 1936. He lived in California until 1941, when he was permitted to return.\n\nCalles (Rojas), Rafael (José) (b. Sept. 4, 1970, Guanare, Portuguesa, Venezuela), governor of Portuguesa (2017-21).\n\nCallimachi, Alexandru Ioan (b. 1737 - d. 1821), prince of Moldavia (1795-99); son of Ioan Teodor Callimachi; son-in-law of Scarlat Grigore Ghica. He was also grand dragoman of the Porte (1785-88).\n\nCallimachi, Grigore Ioan (b. 1735 - d.

He was also minister of agriculture (1914-15).\n\nCalonder, Felix (Louis) (b. Dec. 7, 1863, Scuol, Graubünden, Switzerland - d. June 14, 1952, Zürich), president of the Council of States (1911-12), interior minister (1913-17), foreign minister (1918-19), and president (1918) of Switzerland.\n\nCalonge (y Fenollet), Eusebio (b. Dec. 15, 1814, Vitoria, Spain - d. October 1873, Madrid, Spain), foreign minister of Spain (1866-67). He was also captain-general of the Canary Islands (1852) and Navarra (1852-54) and minister of navy (1866).\n\nCalonne\n\nCalonne, Charles Alexandre de (b. Jan. 20, 1734, Douai, France - d. Oct. 29, 1802, Paris, France), French statesman. He held various posts in French Flanders and in Artois before becoming intendant of Metz (1768) and of Lille (1774). His financial genius and court connections led to his appointment as controller general of finance in November 1783. At that time the French government was heavily in debt. Calonne reconstituted a sinking fund (1784) to pay off the debt, and in 1785 he reformed the gold coinage. He soon discovered, however, that major reforms were necessary to save France from bankruptcy. In August 1786 he submitted to King Louis XVI a far-reaching plan of reform that involved increasing the taxation of the privileged noble and clerical orders through a proportional tax on land. Recognizing that the Parlements (high courts of justice) would reject his proposals, Calonne submitted them instead to a special Assembly of Notables - nobles, clergy, and magistrates - which convened on Feb. 22, 1787. Nevertheless, the intrigues of his political opponents and the antagonism of the higher clergy and magistrates in the assembly thwarted his efforts. His revelation of the annual deficit of more than 100,000,000 livres and the failure of his reform schemes ensured the summons of the Estates-General in August 1788, which in turn led directly to the French Revolution. In April 1787 Louis XVI dismissed Calonne from office, and four months later he withdrew to England. After the Revolution began, Calonne devoted himself to the cause of counterrevolution. He was chief adviser to the émigrés (nobles in exile) from December 1790 until the fall of the monarchy in August 1792. In 1802, during Napoléon Bonaparte's Consulate regime, he returned to France. He died soon thereafter.\n\nCalovski, Naste (b. April 22, 1933, Galicnik, Yugoslavia [now in North Macedonia]), Macedonian diplomat. He was Yugoslav ambassador to Malaysia (1983-87) and permanent representative of Macedonia to the United Nations (1997-2001).\n\nCals\n\nCals, Jo(seph Maria Laurens Theo) (b.

Oct. 20, 1865, San José, Costa Rica), foreign minister of Costa Rica (1844-46, 1847-56). He was also finance and war minister (1844), interior minister (1844-46, 1847-59), and president of the Senate (1864-65).\n\nCalvo Sotelo, José, posthumously (from 1948) duque de Calvo Sotelo (b. May 6, 1893, Tuy, Pontevedra, Spain - d. [assassinated] July 13, 1936, Madrid, Spain), finance minister of Spain (1925-30). He was also civil governor of Valencia (1921-22).\n\nCalvo-Sotelo\n\nCalvo-Sotelo y Bustelo, Leopoldo (Ramón Pedro), from June 24, 2002, marqués de la Ría de Ribadeo (b. April 14, 1926, Madrid, Spain - d. May 3, 2008, Pozuelo, Spain), prime minister of Spain (1981-82); nephew of José Calvo Sotelo. Although he held ministerial office from the end of the Franco era, he first gained political prominence for his role in helping to organize the Christian Democrats and groups further to the right into the Unión Centro Democrático (UCD) in time to win the June 1977 elections. In the subsequent administration he was rewarded with the post of minister without portfolio, in charge of negotiating Spain's accession to the European Communities (EC). Following the resignation of Premier Adolfo Suárez González and the abortive coup of Feb. 23-24, 1981, Deputy Premier Calvo-Sotelo took over the premiership on February 25 and with it the task of guiding Spain's uneasy transition from the authoritarianism of the Franco regime to Western European-style democracy. His task was rendered more difficult by conflict within the ruling UCD between right-wing Christian Democrats and \"Suaristas\" (followers of former premier Suárez). Calvo-Sotelo's election as UCD president in November, replacing Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún (Suárez's brother-in-law) would, it was hoped, consolidate the party under his leadership. Calvo-Sotelo was regarded as a superb administrator and surrounded himself with able technocrats. If his political talents were less marked than those of his predecessor, his credibility with the private sector and trade unions enabled him to achieve the lowest wage settlement in Spain's recent history. His critics faulted him for his lack of success, initially at least, in demonstrating his independence from the preceding government and for his lack of progress (through little fault of his own) in negotiating an agreement with the EC.\n\nCalwell, Arthur (Augustus) (b. Aug. 28, 1896, Melbourne, Victoria - d. July 8, 1973, Melbourne), Australian politician.

Oct. 9, 1966, London, England), British prime minister (2010-16) and foreign secretary (2023-24); great-great-great-great-great-grandson of William IV. The first step of his political career was a job in the Conservative Party research department. After a spell seconded to No. 10 Downing Street where he helped brief John Major for Prime Minister's Questions, he was talent-spotted by Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont who made him his special adviser. After unsuccessfully standing in Stafford in the 1997 general election, he entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for Witney, northwest of London. He became the leading light of the so-called \"Notting Hill set\" of young modernizers who grouped themselves around Michael Howard after he became leader in 2003. After only two years in Parliament, Cameron was appointed to the Conservative front bench. Howard entrusted him with the key task of policy coordinator in the run-up to the 2005 election. After the Conservatives were defeated and Howard resigned, Cameron was elected party leader, defeating David Davis in the final vote. In the 2010 general election he built the Tory campaign around the concept of the \"Big Society\" - a far cry (at least rhetorically) from the days of Margaret Thatcher, who said there was no such thing as society. His \"green\" credentials took a knock when it was disclosed that he was followed on his bicycle ride to work by a driver taking his papers and other belongings. The Conservatives emerged as the strongest party, but short of a majority, and he formed a government together with the Liberal Democrats, the first coalition government since World War II. At 43 he became the youngest prime minister in almost 200 years, being a few months younger than Tony Blair was on taking office in 1997. In 2015 he won a majority for the Conservatives alone. Having promised an \"in-out\" referendum on EU membership to mollify Euroskeptics, this was duly held in June 2016, and although he campaigned for the \"Remain\" side, \"Leave\" won 52%-48%. He then said he would resign before the autumn; he was succeeded by Theresa May in July. In September he also resigned as MP. In 2023 he was surprisingly brought back as foreign secretary and created a life peer.\n\nCamescasse, Jean Louis Ernest (b. Sept. 23, 1838, Brest, Finistère, France - d.

In 1982 she was elected as the first woman president of the Liberal Party.
