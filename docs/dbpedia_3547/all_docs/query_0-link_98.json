It has become a key element in the promotion and public relations of the image of Spanish wines in the complicated British market and is set to play an important role in the coming years, given the complicated post-BREXIT scenario that predicts competition. increasing popularity of New World wines.\n\nSince its foundation, each year it accredits personalities who have distinguished themselves exceptionally in the promotion of wine and especially quality Spanish wines in this market. All members are linked, directly or indirectly, to the wine sector: winemakers, importers, members of the Masters of Wine Institute, the specialized press and Spanish restaurants in the United Kingdom.\n\nCurrently, the Investiture Dinner of the Grand Order of the Knights of Wine is considered the best public relations and networking event on the Spanish wine calendar in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the context of the dinner, the investiture of the new members is celebrated, of which this year there have been three: Almudena Alberca, the first female Master of Wine in Spain and director of wineries throughout Spain, including Bodegas Palacio and Viña Mayor.
