        "text": "3.1 A Civil Law for a Religious Society\n\nTo inquire on Latin American colonial law requires remembering a time before the institution of national legal systems and before legislation became the primary tool for legal creation. Understanding that time, so foreign to our contemporary experience, mandates that we take a journey into a past that was vastly different than our present. This journey will show that the main issue in understanding early modern alterity is not revealing the obvious fact that specific norms were different, but instead shedding light on a legal universe that was profoundly distinct from our own. It will also demonstrate the enormous difficulties in imagining a colonial law as many scholars have described it in the past: clearly distinguishable from a metropolitan law, mainly resulting from legislation, and with a certain unity or intentionality (for the details of the relevant historiographical discussions, see Section 1.1).\n\nTo understand how Europeans implemented legal systems in the colonies and how these operated, it is essential to begin in Europe, our first stop. In the chapter’s first section, we will observe what early modern European law consisted of, and how it functioned, including the relations between civil and canon law and the existence of a multiplicity of jurisdictions, that is, of authorities endowed with the capacity to declare and apply the law (juris-dictio). Moving ahead, our second stop will be to examine how this pan-European matrix operated in Spain and Portugal. Here, among other things, we will see that royal orders were jurisdictional acts that declared and applied the law but did not create it. Iberian kings did not invent new rules; they applied rules allegedly already in existence to concrete situations. The third stop of our journey focuses on how, starting in the sixteenth century, this matrix was transported to the Americas, where both the Spanish and the Portuguese faced the questions of how to adapt their own laws to the colonial situation and how to deal with what they perceived as local variations, including indigenous and African legalities. To explain how all this operated, the fourth stop will be a close examination of the case of customary law. After surveying its role in Europe, and then in Spain and Portugal, we will observe how it operated in the Iberian American colonies in general, and vis-à-vis indigenous and Afro-Latin American legalities in particular. Our journey will end with the practical questions of how we can reconstruct colonial law and how we can set Iberian colonial law in the larger global context of European early modern colonialism.\n\nThe Early Modern European Legal Universe\n\nThe first stop on our journey is to understand that the early modern European law (derecho, direito, diritto, droit) that shaped developments in the colonies was not a collection of legal solutions but an assortment of suggestions – some more prescriptive than others – regarding how to analyze social phenomena so as to identify a just solution. The basic assumption that guided this legal universe was that a preset divine order existed, indicating how things must transpire. All members of society, including the authorities but also a plethora of other actors such as jurists, theologians, judges, officials, and many others, had the obligation to defend this divine order. To uncover what it prescribed, they considered multiple sources. Those who attended university looked for indications in texts of Roman, canon and feudal law, as well as theology, all of which they learned to analyze and debate during their academic training. They, and others who had no university training, also appealed to Scripture, customs, common sense, as well as royal and local enactments.\n\nThe plurality of actors who engaged in these efforts at discovery, the variety of situations they discussed, and the multiplicity of sources they considered, ensured that this hermeneutical effort led to constant debates and disagreements, with different actors and authors often proposing distinct, sometimes even outright contradictory, solutions. Some solutions were considered more trustworthy than others, either because of the reputation of those who proposed them, or because they had successfully stood the test of extensive debate. However, no solution was ever considered final, because at stake was not who made the pronouncement, but whether it correctly captured what contemporaries considered the ultimate truth.\n\nThis understanding of the law was widely disseminated both socially and geographically. In the past, many scholars appealed to what they described as a gap between law and its application, “law on the books” versus “law in action,” an erudite and a popular sphere of legal knowledge and practice. Yet, these descriptions mostly depended on a very narrow and often anachronistic understanding that equated law with legislation. This understanding assumed that early modern kings enacted rules that their subjects were obliged to follow. But this was not how early modern European law operated. Indeed, when the activities of contemporary actors are compared not only to royal enactments or the opinion of a single jurist, but instead to the compound world of legal debates and its multiplicity of suggestions, it becomes astonishingly clear that even illiterate actors living in remote communities fully participated in this universe. These actors knew, for example, that in order to use communal pasture, they needed to be members of the community, and that, to achieve recognition as such, they had to demonstrate their loyalty to it. They were equally aware that their usage of the land gave them rights to continue doing so, and they understood that if others invaded their territories, they needed to protest immediately, else their silence would be interpreted as consent. Though less erudite actors were not always clear about why this was the case, or what plethora of options were available in legal debates, nonetheless, individuals of very different social, educational, and economic backgrounds were cognizant of how they had to behave to obtain or guard rights.\n\nHistorians have yet to explain how these processes of communication between a juridical and a popular sphere took place. Most actors, convinced that these practices were so self-evident as to require no explanation, seldom discussed them explicitly. When asked by neighbors, the authorities, or judges why they thought these behaviors awarded them rights, most suggested that they followed them because this was how god created the universe: The practices reflected the way things were, and had always been, everywhere. These responses point to legal knowledge acquired by processes of socialization. These likely included informal observation and conversations, texts read or read out in public by town criers, as well as participation in public rituals and ceremonies in which certain ideas and structures were created, manifested, and reproduced. Clergymen also had a major role in inculcating this implicit normative knowledge in their Christian flock by intervening in local conflicts, giving advice, hearing confessions, explaining and telling the law, and preaching sermons.\n\nEurope: Civil and Canon Law\n\nThough the sources considered by those seeking to reach a just solution were diverse and a multiplicity of persons was engaging in these discussions, we tend to divide the European legal universe into two branches, distinguishing civil from canon law. This distinction, intuitively dependent on a split between the material and the spiritual, was nevertheless also based on a particular vision of the law, one that placed the sources studied, as well as jurisdiction – that is, the faculty to declare and apply the law – at the center of the legal universe. This vision organized legal knowledge not according to purely thematic divisions, as we do today (such as “contract law” or “criminal law”), and not even according to what pertained to the spiritual (everything did), but according to the texts consulted, as well as by whether they originated with or were likely to be required by secular or religious authorities.\n\nDespite this separation, however, early modern actors believed that both civil and canon law worked together to guarantee justice and that, together, they formed the common law of the Christian community, its ius commune. Contemporaries referred to this understanding when they described civil and canon law as “the one and the other law” (utrumque ius) and expected most university-trained jurists to have studied both. Monarchs also acknowledged this when they ruled that if an answer could not be found in “one of the two laws,” it could be sought in the other. Thus, though both rulers and jurists distinguished civil from canon law, they also considered them to be mutually supportive and to form a unified legal universe together.\n\nThe co-penetration between civil and canon law, and often moral theology, was not only the domain of theory but also clear in the treatment of specific questions. For example, the Decretum, the mid-twelfth-century compilation of canon law, instructed users to follow civil law where canon law was silent. Canon law practitioners constantly looked to civil law for answers to questions such as whether a heretic had a valid legal personality and could administer a valid baptism, or to affirm that rules about communal life must be approved by all (quod omnes tangit debet ab omnibus approbari), a principle derived from classical Roman law. Jurists of civil law followed the same procedure when they debated the categorization of certain individuals as miserabilis (in need of special protection due to poverty, sickness, old age, or similar) (see Sections 1.3 and 3.2), a classification that originated in canon law but was soon after also taken up by civil law. Debates regarding how judges must proceed to collect and weigh evidence and to reach conclusions, initially conducted in the context of ecclesiastical courts, also affected the ways secular courts operated. The pope’s efforts to affirm his supremacy within the Church and vis-à-vis the bishops contributed to the development of legal and political models that would eventually lead to the birth of states, and the emergence of the concept of sovereignty. The Church also intervened in matters we today associate with civil law, such as contract law.\n\nThis close association between civil and canon law, as well as moral theology, allowed actors as late as the eighteenth century to conclude that a theologian’s education qualified him to serve as a judge also in civil courts. What he lacked was not knowledge or an understanding of the relevant normative debates, only experience in the courts, which he could easily obtain while exercising the office. Thus, although in this volume we treat civil and canon law separately, it is important to remember that during the medieval and early modern periods, they were not considered independent of each other, but instead seen as together forming the ius commune of Christian Europe.\n\nEurope: A Multiplicity of Jurisdictions\n\nEarly modern European law thus featured discussions rather than solutions, guiding ideas rather than rules. In such a universe, there was never a single authoritative answer, but rather a variety of possibilities that actors had to consider. If there was no single answer, neither was there a single authority that could decide what it would be. Early modern European states were not the unitary structures headed by a king or a republican authority that historians once imagined them to be. Instead, historians of European law now define these states as “jurisdictional states” consisting of a conglomerate of communities and corporations, including cities and villages, confraternities and guilds, families and congregations, religious and ethnic groups. Each of these units was considered a “republic,” that is, a body politic, and each had authorities endowed with jurisdiction, that is, with the capacity to declare and apply the law.\n\nThus, despite the conviction that a universal Christian and Roman ecumene existed, in practice this ecumene was divided into communities, each having a natural right to regulate itself. As the famous jurist Baldus de Ubaldi (1327–1400) once argued, this right was inherent to all groups and functioned “like spirit and soul in animated creatures.” Communal organs intervened in the local order by pronouncing sentences that rendered determinations about the past or by announcing norms that would apply in the future. Legal historians have thus asserted that, although the norms applying to the future may seem legislative to us – and indeed many historians have interpreted them as “legislation” – in reality, they were jurisdictional: Rather than inventing new rules, their goal was to declare and apply rules that were said to have predated the need to use them. Furthermore, whether the authorities of corporations were resolving past conflicts or enacting instructions regarding the future, their decisions had to be just, that is, they had to reflect the preexisting divine order and thus to preserve the status quo that allegedly reproduced it.\n\nThough the commonly agreed goal was to preserve the status quo, the various authorities could bitterly disagree about how this should be done, because, among other things, the indications they found in the sources were multiple rather than singular, and because each situation was considered distinct and thus meriting a detailed examination. Aiming to come to a just decision in accordance with the divinely ordained order, rather than to follow a particular rule or guarantee legal certainty, the authorities had a great degree of discretion. Indeed, discretion was considered essential to ensuring a just solution, as it allowed adapting existing norms and ideas to the specific case in hand. Royal orders did not limit this discretion, as they mostly indicated not how a case was to be resolved but emphasized the primacy of the duty to decide the matter justly. Given these characteristics of early modern European law, to expect decisions to be constant across cases and authorities is to misunderstand how this legal universe operated.\n\nThe early modern normative world in Europe was thus both deeply united and highly fractured. It was united because all social actors were committed to upholding the preset divine order, and they all engaged in discussing how this could be done by relying on similar sources and employing similar vocabularies and techniques. It was fractured because within it there were multiple authorities competent to declare and apply the law, and these could, and did, easily produce different, even contradictory, solutions. As a result, while there was a shared framework and extensive communication between different jurisdictions and authorities, the norms in each could vary dramatically.\n\nThe main task of jurists was to ensure that despite conflicting indications as to which was the correct solution, or even conflicting results, the legal system would remain united. To achieve this goal, jurists developed vocabularies, techniques, and ways of arguing. They also adopted important rules regarding interpretation, which mandated, for example, that the local be preferred to the general, and the newer to the older, unless the general and the older were considered more just.\n\nThe legal order thus operated simultaneously on a pan-European level and in a highly particularistic way. This said, it would be erroneous to consider this universe as featuring legal pluralism, as some historians have argued. The existence of a plurality of jurisdictions did not produce distinct legal regimes. What existed instead was a universal common law that had to be localized. In other words, though this legal universe operated on multiple levels and with a plurality of sources and authorities, it remained one single system.\n\nThe European Legal Matrix as It Operated in Spain and Portugal\n\nMost present-day historians of Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin American law subscribe to these interpretations. They explain that, as elsewhere in Europe, the laws of the Iberian kingdoms were composed of multiple sources, discussed by multiple agents, and implemented by multiple authorities endowed with jurisdiction. Though the decisions of the various authorities could differ from each other, sometimes radically so, they nonetheless confirmed the existence of a ius commune that featured the universal search to uncover and preserve the preset divine order by discussing ancient and religious texts, by studying customs and the activities of multiple jurisdictional bodies, and by employing “common sense.”\n\nThese features were pan-European, yet scholars of Spanish and Portuguese legal history also stress the important connections between developments in the different kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula. They argue that scholars and practitioners in Southern Europe, also including Italy and France, formed part of a particularly intensive communication system, whose members read and cited one another with great frequency (see Section 1.3). These exchanges led to striking similarities in the ways they debated questions and proposed solutions. Spain and Portugal also shared legal traditions that emerged not only because of their common adherence to ius commune or due to a shared communication network but also because of their common historical trajectory, including Roman, Visigoth, and Muslim occupation, the so-called Reconquest, overseas expansion, temporary periods of unity during the Middle Ages and the early modern period, similar experiences concerning state formation and liberal revolutions, French occupation, and so forth. These commonalities sustained the existence of a “customary Iberian law” and explain, for example, why, until the seventeenth century and possibly even later, Portuguese actors could use the Castilian Siete Partidas, a thirteenth-century restatement of ius commune, as if it were their own.\n\nSpain and Portugal: The Status of Royal Enactments\n\nA key question in understanding how this legal universe dealt with new situations – such as those raised by the establishment of colonies and the resultant encounter with non-European normativities – is to understand the status and role attributed to royal orders in it. In the older historiography, royal legislation was often seen as the key ingredient of colonial law. However, as has become clear in the preceding discussion, in the early modern legal universe, monarchs were just one of a plurality of authorities who could declare the law, and all these authorities searched for a just solution by referring to a common set of texts, techniques, and practices.\n\nOver the course of the early modern period, Spanish and Portuguese monarchs, like their counterparts elsewhere in Europe, did attempt to bolster their powers by insisting on their authority to declare and apply the law, and by demanding that their decisions be preferred to all other legal sources. In Castile, the Ordenamiento de Alcalá (1348) and the Leyes de Toro (1505) attempted this by instructing that royal orders be accorded the greatest authority, followed by customs (fueros), and only then by ius commune. Castilian monarchs also elaborated rules regarding which jurists should be favored. For example, in 1499, the Catholic kings expressed a preference for the works of the Italian civil jurist Bartolus of Sassoferrato (1313–1357) and his student Baldus de Ubaldis, and the Italian canon law jurists Johannes Andreas (1270–1348) and Niccolò de Tudeschi, alias Panoramitanus (1386–1445). In Portugal, royal pronouncements similarly established the rule that ius commune was to serve as a subsidiary source and be consulted only when royal law, courtly practice (estilo da nossa corte), and ancient customs of the kingdom (costume dos nossos reinos antigamente usado) were insufficient. If no solution could be found in these, experts were first to appeal to canon law, then to the interpretations offered by the Italian jurist Franciscus Accursius (1182–1263), and as a last resort to the work of Bartolus of Sassoferrato, because, as the Portuguese kings put it, even if other jurists disagreed with him, most held his opinions to be most reasonable.\n\nAs far as we can tell, however, in practice, Spanish and Portuguese jurists and practitioners mostly ignored these royal attempts to establish a hierarchy of sources of law or developed legal presumptions that rendered them irrelevant. Presumptions were legal techniques that allowed jurists to assume the existence of a fact without having to prove it first. One such presumption was that royal orders were never intended to modify either ius commune or customary law. Jurists also insisted that ius commune featured a complex system of organization, interpretation, and discussion that embodied a “natural reason” and could therefore be applied irrespective of whether the king allowed the use of ius commune or not. Furthermore, as we saw earlier, in the early modern legal universe, it was undisputed that judges must rule by employing arbitrium, that is, the power (and the obligation) to decide correctly, rather than simply obeying a particular norm.\n\nThus, although royal orders mattered, it is essential for understanding early modern law – and the development of colonial law in particular – that we appreciate that they were never perceived as external to the existing order, nor as capable of modifying it – at least until theories of sovereignty won the day in the eighteenth century. Like the pronouncements made by other authorities endowed with jurisdiction, royal orders were directed at finding a just solution for a particular case. Royal enactments themselves explicitly acknowledged this understanding of their status and purpose. As early as the thirteenth century, royal jurists stated that the final aim of all legislation (ley) was to demonstrate the things of God, provide a guide to living well, be a source of discipline, show the law (derecho) and what the good customs were, and to love justice. Royal orders, therefore, were not legislation as we would understand this term today. Most did not deal with matters generally, but were instead jurisdictional acts, produced to resolve a particular situation that required royal intervention. They usually included information on the specific circumstances of the case and often also mentioned the existence of conflicting possibilities as to how it could be solved.\n\nCompilations of royal orders, such as the famous Castilian Nueva Recopilación of 1567 and Novísima Recopilación of 1805, the Spanish-American Recopilación de Indias, and the Portuguese Ordenações, openly discussed the limited enforceability of royal orders. They instructed readers to obey the latter, yet also acknowledged that they were not final (as new solutions might be required), that local norms and norms pertaining to corporations and communities, even if contradictory, must be respected, and that, in cases of legal lacunae, when no answers could be found in royal instructions, other sources must be consulted. It is therefore not surprising that authorities in both Madrid and Lima agreed that instructions of the Recopilación de Indias that went against local practices should be ignored.\n\nBecause they were the easiest to find and use, particularly when included in Recopilaciones, royal orders were often the most visible part of the legal system, both to contemporaries and to later historians. However, they were neither superior to other sources of law nor did they stand on their own. Furthermore, recopilaciones omitted most of the information regarding the case that the royal orders had been intended to resolve, as well as the legal reasoning that underlay the original decision. Despite this silence, contemporaries were aware of the fact that compilations furnished only the tip of the iceberg: Hidden from view was the huge volume of discussions that underlay royal decisions and was essential for understanding their correct meaning. This was particularly the case in compilations of royal orders that served as indices rather than law books. While recopilaciones were thus meant to facilitate the work of jurists and interested parties by letting them know which cases had already been resolved by the monarch, they still needed to consult the original decisions to know whether a case could serve as a precedent, or indeed why it had been decided as it was.\n\nFurthermore, royal compilations were not the only instruments that jurists and litigants could use. Many jurists also authored legal recompilations, which they believed were necessary to facilitate knowledge of the legal system. While only a few were sanctioned by the kings, others – which we would nowadays perhaps consider mere personal projects – also aided contemporaries as they navigated this complex legal universe. Whether privately prepared or sanctioned by the monarchs, however, all compilations of royal orders followed the same procedure, with original decisions being stripped of their context and the reasons that had led to their adoption. Thus, even in the case of authoritative compilations, contemporaries insisted that the validity of the precedents enumerated in a recopilación did not depend on their insertion in the collection, but on the validity of the original decision. Early modern jurists often criticized even the formal recopilaciones that won royal approval for failing to reproduce the precedents correctly, for assembling precedents that were unrelated, for rearranging royal orders incorrectly, and for neglecting to mention the facts that had led to the royal decision – criticisms echoed by many modern scholars. Some of the latter have even gone as far as to characterize the processes of selection and summation involved in the production of royal recopilaciones as capricious. Given these concerns, litigants and jurists who were able to cite the original royal decisions tended to do so. The Siete Partidas, a work that collected juridical opinions and acquired an extended gloss, was similarly often ignored by more erudite discussants, who preferred to consult the original texts.\n\nIn the Portuguese world, too, collections of royal orders were drawn up. Though the Portuguese monarchs did not sanction compilations other than the various Ordenacões (most famous among them, the Ordenações Afonsinas, Manuelinas, and Filipinas), individual jurists and institutions labored to remedy this lack by providing their own. Yet the Portuguese jurists, too, acknowledged that these compilations had no normative value, because they were tools rather than laws.\n\nThe Immigration of European Law to the Americas\n\nTogether with European people, religion, and social, cultural, and economic institutions, this legal universe was exported overseas. Its immigration into the colonial territories was promoted by Iberian monarchs who ordered the implementation of Castilian or Portuguese law overseas, but it was mainly a by-product of the way early modern European normativity, which largely ignored political divisions, functioned. Implementing the European legal universe in the colonies meant that not only the belief in a preset divine order was imported but also the technologies developed over time as to how to discover and protect it. These technologies led to debates rather than to unique solutions and revealed guidelines rather than rules.\n\nSimilarities between Spanish and Portuguese law in Europe and in the Americas also extended to the existence of a multiplicity of jurisdictions. Like the Iberian territories in Europe, Spanish and Portuguese America were divided into multiple communities (which contemporaries identified as “republics”), each with authorities endowed with the right (and the obligation) to declare and apply the law. These communities were multiple because each locality, group, and household was one (see Section 3.3). There were hundreds of Portuguese, Spanish, and indigenous “republics,” “republics” that were based on locality, and others that embraced individuals who exercised the same profession, professed the same creed, or lived in the same household. Though multiple, all these republics belonged to the “republic of republics,” the Christian ecumene.\n\nA paradigmatic example of how the European legal system operated in the colonies is provided by the work of Juan de Solórzano y Pereira (1575–1655). Solórzano was a judge in Lima and the author of a mid-seventeenth-century manual of legal matters arising from colonial situations that was extremely popular, particularly in its abbreviated Spanish translation. In this manual, Solórzano included questions that a colonial judge or administrator might encounter and provided a number of possible answers. While he did give his opinion as to which of the possible options was the most just, he nonetheless showcased the multiplicity of questions that needed asking and the variety of possible answers, as well as the need to consult a wide range of authors. He referenced no less than 30,000 works written by over 3,000 authors, many of whom were born, had studied, or resided outside Spain.\n\nSolórzano never imagined that the questions he asked had a simple, definitive answer. Neither did he believe that such an answer could be found in royal enactments or in royal recompilations. When he did use the medieval Siete Partidas, he treated it not as a royal command, but as an encyclopedia of ius commune. Although most historians consider Solórzano to have authored a manual of colonial law, Solórzano himself never conceived of his work as describing a new or separate law for the colonies. He was clearly conscious of the fact that conditions in the Americas presented new questions and new challenges and therefore warranted discussion, but nowhere in his writing does he conclude that a colonial law, distinct from European law, existed. Instead, Solórzano articulated a synthesis of what he observed as a practicing judge, what he read, what was already established, and of new solutions that he formulated using existing techniques. He employed the knowledge he gathered by residing in the Americas and working as a magistrate, but he also constantly relied on his training as a jurist and his familiarity with both civil and canon law. His manual aimed at systematizing a huge array of often contradictory solutions, which he applied to his specific time and place – mid-seventeenth-century Peru – and arranged into a logical edifice that was plausible but, as always, only one proposal among many. Despite Solórzano’s efforts and enormous erudition, the edifice he created, like early modern law itself, was replete with contradictions, ambiguities, and inconsistencies.\n\nThus, regardless of what we may think about early modern actors and their values today, the conviction that law must provide a just solution that fitted the specific circumstances of each case, place, and time, was as pervasive in the colonies as it was in Europe. Ibero-America neither had a distinct colonial law nor was it a zone of lawlessness, as Carl Schmitt argued. Instead, it was a highly legalistic space where both the Spanish and the Portuguese implemented legal systems that formed part of European law, in which debates were more frequent than agreements, and where a general ius commune coexisted with a mosaic of specific solutions.\n\nWhen the authorities failed to adapt the solutions to the specific context, locals protested. Among the most famous mechanism enabling them to do so was to “obey but not comply” (obedecer y no cumplir). This faculty, long seen by historians as permitting abuses, was nevertheless a legitimate legal procedure practiced in medieval and early modern Iberia as well as being present elsewhere in Europe. It allowed locals to suspend obedience to orders that were against local practices, customs, or privileges, or that were considered in other ways unjust, and to advocate for a different, sounder solution. Procedures similar to obedecer y no cumplir also existed in Portuguese America, where royal orders were considered binding only as long as they were compatible with local norms. When royal precepts did not seem appropriate to local conditions or contradicted local privileges, actors could ignore them. The conviction that the norms must fit the circumstances of place and time was also expressed by royal officials; the fifth viceroy of Peru, Francisco de Toledo (1515–1582), for example, pointed out the danger of giving the same rules to communities that were different.\n\nAs in Europe, royal attempts to control this diversity and to subject law to the royal will mostly failed. On multiple occasions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Spanish kings insisted on the applicability of Castilian law in the “New World” and pointed out that the overseas territories should be governed according to the preferences expressed in the 1505 Leyes de Toro, which placed royal orders at the top of the hierarchy of norms. Legal historians have shown that these efforts were as unsuccessful in colonial Latin America as they had been in Europe. Equally moot was a royal attempt to ensure that Peninsular law won the approval of the Council of the Indies before being applied in the Americas. As a result, looking to the royal law to understand Iberian colonial law is incorrect and anachronistic, as is the assumption of a separation of colonial from metropolitan law.\n\nPresent-day legal historians, therefore, conclude that colonial Latin American law was an American version of ius commune or, as contemporaries sometimes classified it, a “municipal” law in a legal universe that admitted both a pan-European framework as well as local variations. These historians reject the view of earlier generations who portrayed Spanish colonial law as a unitary and systematic body of law developed specifically by the monarchs for overseas rule (see Section 1.1). They also question older views that identified such a unified body of law as derecho indiano, arguing that this term, rather than reflecting early modern realities, was the product of historiographical and political ambitions in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which sought to identify a particular (and superior) Spanish mode of colonialism.\n\nParadoxically, although historians of Portuguese America never pretended that Portuguese overseas territories were ruled by a single, unitary colonial law, they, too, engaged in the effort of presenting the Portuguese imperial endeavor as exceptional. An older generation of historians argued that, in contrast to other colonial empires, the Portuguese were willing to adapt to local realities, developing legal regimes that were highly flexible. However, this portrayal, sometimes called Luso-Tropicalism, also responded to twentieth-century ideological pressures that reflected political goals rather than history. In fact, Luso-American law formed part of the general European ius commune: the Ancien régime, as António Manuel Hespanha put it, also extended to the tropics.\n\nHow Early Modern European Law Operated I: The Example of Customary Law\n\nHow all this operated in Europe (first) and the colonies (second) can be demonstrated by observing customary law, which has been on the minds of legal historians in recent years. Customs are an interesting example because the older colonial historiography assumed that they were an authentic reflection of communal traditions, that they did not form part of the “law” but were external to it, or were particular to certain groups but not others (such as the alleged distinction between a written legal system followed by the colonists and the unwritten customs of the indigenous populations). Recent scholarship has questioned these conclusions, pointing out that customs were an important part of European law, too, and that they operated similarly in Europe and its colonies. The study of customs, therefore, allows us to examine how early modern European law operated, while also demonstrating the need to understand the functioning of European law in order to grasp developments in the colonies.\n\nThe European background, with which I begin this section, shows why older interpretations that suggested that indigenous customs included an autochthonous normativity that either reflected ancient traditions or at least stood for a distinct culture that might have served to delay or resist the implementation of European law, are problematic. A better grasp of the development of the European understanding of customary law explains how, on the contrary, it was possible for indigenous customs in the American territories to be relatively recent, change over time, and be affected by imperial law and colonial conditions. How indigenous and Afro-Latin American customary law interacted with the imported Iberian legal universe to create a colonial law will be the subject of the following two sections.\n\nCustoms were an important source of European law from as early as the second century AD and throughout late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the early modern period. During this long timespan, jurists viewed customs as norms reproducing local particularism that could differ from and sometimes even contradict the general law, yet complemented rather than stood in opposition to it.\n\nThis understanding of customs was particularly clear in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when university-trained jurists began categorizing existing European local law as “customary.” They argued that each community had norms that constituted its “customs.” These local norms could originate in statutes, constitutions, acts of authority, jurisprudence, or in repeating acts that community members believed prescriptive. What distinguished customs from other laws, then, was not the way they were created, but the fact that they were particular to a locality. Though such local norms could vary from community to community, jurists saw no contradiction between the diversity of customs and the unity of ius commune. They believed that they mutually reinforced rather than opposed one another. To them, customs were an essential component of the legal universe because they guaranteed just solutions by being highly attuned to the specific context of place, time, and group. They were also the natural product of the process of concretization required of legal practitioners, who, as we saw earlier, found just solutions not by following abstract rules but by weighing different norms anew for each individual case. Meanwhile, ius commune guaranteed that, despite these local variations, all Christians would share a basic understanding of what justice mandated.\n\nCustoms, in other words, might have been created locally by either the authorities or community members, but they also won the approval and support of jurists, who labored both to identify local norms as customary and to integrate them into a wider legal universe. The interconnectivity between customs and legal thought was especially evident during campaigns to write down the local law, in which jurists abandoned the axiom that customs must be oral and produced written collections of customary law. Such campaigns took place across Europe in the late Middle Ages and the early modern period. In the Iberian world, when collections of customs covered a wide range of activities, they obtained the status of fuero or foro. There were fueros and foros of towns, certain guilds or occupations, and groups, such as the fuero militar, which applied to soldiers.\n\nWhile the efforts of writing down the local customs were supposedly motivated by the wish to better know and conserve them, the resulting collections demonstrate that those recording customs often dramatically changed them. In their attempts to systematize and rationalize local laws, jurists decontextualized and de-historicized what they observed and made unique solutions into general rules. The modifications introduced by them were so extensive that some scholars have likened the process to the forced acculturation that colonizers inflicted on the colonized. In choosing what to record as custom, jurists also developed the rules regarding what custom was. They distinguished practices that were compulsory (customs) from others that were not (which they called usos, “uses”), and set rules as to how long a norm needed to have existed for it to become prescriptive. As a result of these processes of recording and definition, customary law as scholars tend to think about it today came into being. The image of customary law as community-based and ancient has become so pervasive and so evident that we tend to forget how it emerged. Thus, while we remember that customs might have originated in communities or with their authorities, we no longer recall that they underwent juridical reinvention from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and were deeply affected by the dominating presence of ius commune.\n\nJuridical intervention in customary law was so successful that, by the fourteenth century, customs (consuetudo) and customary law (ius consuetudinarium) had become an integral part of European law. One of the main reasons for the growing significance of customs was that they came to be considered a useful tool not only for affirming local autonomy but also for defining the relations between the different units that together constituted the emerging states, as well as between them and the developing central authorities. Members of different groups, alleging that customs were part of their communal heritage, used them to make demands on kings. Kings, in turn, invoked custom both to signal their respect for the liberties of their subjects and, on the contrary, to impose limits on them.\n\nAlthough by the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, many customs could be found in written compilations, those not recorded in writing could still be substantiated by the declaration of witnesses, who tended to describe them as “immemorial.” Many historians have assumed that immemoriality was the same as antiquity or even authenticity, yet such was not the case. Rather than necessarily attesting to the antiquity of customs, “immemoriality” was an instrument designed and implemented by jurists: It was a presumption, that is, a category of proof that jurists invented to solve difficult cases.\n\nPresumptions mostly reproduced conclusions that seemed commonsensical to contemporaries. A typical presumption was the inference that a child born in wedlock was the offspring of both spouses. Most presumptions only acted to reverse the burden of proof. Instead of placing it on the plaintiff (to show that the child was the offspring of both spouses, e.g., in cases of alimony), they shifted it to the defendant, who had to produce evidence to contradict the presumption (in this case, showing that the child could not be the offspring of the husband by proving, for example, that he was absent when the child was conceived). Immemoriality, however, used by jurists to prove the existence of a custom, was a special type of presumption, called a praesumptio juris et de jure. In contrast to other presumptions, it admitted of no rebuttal. Even if there was solid evidence showing that it led to the wrong conclusion, jurists still adhered to the presumption, allowing a party to prove something that they knew was incorrect.\n\nThe juridical assertion that customs could be classified as immemorial is therefore a powerful proof of jurists’ desire to support and legitimize them. Jurists not only accepted local law as customary and proceeded to record it, but they were also willing to adopt extreme solutions to enable locals to argue (by invoking immemoriality) for the existence of customs even when information was scarce or wholly absent. The presumption of immemoriality converted local norms for which no one remembered how and why they had originated into “the best title in the world” (consuetudo immemoriabilis praestat meliorem titulum de mundo) that could not be refuted. Juridical support of customs also included the argument that it was plausible to assume that the authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical, and/or the community at large, had agreed to what was immemorial, else they would have prohibited it. And, because immemorial practices were presumed to have won broad social acceptance, some jurists argued that they could be assumed to be reasonable and good.\n\nJurists might have curated customs into powerful tools, but jurisdictional authorities and litigants also supported them. Comparing, for example, what litigants said to what jurists argued demonstrates the surprising degree to which most litigants described not their individual experiences, but instead what was legally required. Incorporating and domesticating juridical categories as their own – without being necessarily aware of their full implications, and most probably following the advice of notaries, judges, lawyers, or other experts or peers – witnesses in late medieval and early modern Europe constantly argued that their customs were immemorial. They understood that this term was a powerful one, and they employed it in order to ensure a result to their liking.\n\nHistorians have asserted that, paradoxically, recourse to immemoriality enabled change, with newer customs being easily characterized as immemorial. In addition, immemoriality was invoked even when the customs described had a clear point of departure that the witnesses remembered, and the presumption was thus not strictly necessary. While immemoriality, ironically, allowed for constant change, the writing down of customs did the opposite. Though recording customs in writing did modify what was remembered and how, after customs had been written down, they became fixed. As a result, they could no longer easily cater for changes.\n\nThe study of customs thus reveals the interdependency between customs and juridical debates as well as between customs and royal attempts to control them. It demonstrates the importance of presumptions and commonsense assertions, and the plurality of options that existed at each given moment. It also displays the pan-European character of these legal entanglements because the dynamics unleashed by the processes of defining, addressing, and proving customs were common to many European countries. They were certainly impactful also in Spain and Portugal, where the presence of customs was recorded in antiquity, where kings attempted to control local normativity mainly by writing it down, and where local compilations of ius commune – such as the Siete Partidas – dealt extensively with customs. As would eventually happen also in the Americas, Spanish monarchs ordered their subjects and officials to obey customary law as long as its instructions did not contradict the mandates of god or reason, did not require improvement or change, and did not contradict royal instructions. Spanish and Portuguese practitioners, theologians, and jurists did the same, describing different customs, explaining their origins, and advocating their importance.\n\nHow Early Modern Law Operated II: Customary Law in the Iberian Colonies\n\nThe interaction between local customary and global law, and between customary law and jurists, which emerged in late medieval and early modern Europe, was central to developments also in the colonies. In both Spanish and Portuguese America, a huge plethora of customs was recognized by jurists and practitioners as prescriptive: local customs as well as customs of corporations, communities, households, and groups, and customs of Spanish, indigenous, and Afro-Latin American communities. As in Europe, these customs were understood as representing a local legal specificity operating alongside the common framework that united them all, a true ius commune. Often written down, customs could also be supported by the declarations of witnesses who frequently classified them as immemorial, though this did not mean that they were necessarily ancient. Finally, customs were perceived as belonging to certain groups and could become a powerful instrument to resist external imposition and affirm local autonomy to declare and apply the law, but this did not make them external to the law itself, only an important, indeed an essential, part thereof.\n\nBecause customs – in the colonies as in Europe – could be integrated into the early modern legal universe only after jurists declared them “good” and in harmony with religious precepts, the question which customs could be recognized as valid greatly preoccupied contemporaries. Also important was the need to decide which practices were usos that had no normative valence and which were customs (costumbres and sometimes fueros) and therefore binding.\n\nThe Particular Case of Indigenous Customs\n\nThese findings challenge previous historians’ understanding of custom in the colonies. Historians tended to concentrate their attention mostly on indigenous customs – seen either as authentic practices or a colonial invention – but always as different from “the law.” However, as we have seen, customs – including, but not restricted, to indigenous customs – were part of the legal order. Furthermore, customs were always extremely local: Rather than belonging, for example, to all Spanish or all indigenous communities (as in the idea of “Spanish customs” or “indigenous customs”), each group and each locality had its own. Multiple rather than unique, complex rather than simple, customs included an enormous range of practices and norms that could vary dramatically from place to place, group to group, and over time.\n\nGiven the importance of customary law to European and Iberian legal traditions, it is not surprising that colonial actors turned their attention to indigenous customs. They did so as clergymen who wished to guarantee indigenous conversion, as administrators looking for feasible solutions, but also as jurists whose task it was to cater for local variations as long as they did not contradict the ius commune. Royal officials made efforts to find information about indigenous normativities by sending out questionnaires throughout the territories, asking which indigenous customs, good or bad, pre- or post-conquest, existed. Aware of the enormous diversity in indigenous customs, the local officers and indigenous individuals who answered the questionnaires sent back information regarding governmental structures, taxation, laws, and the administration of justice. Royal magistrates also participated in these efforts of discovery and documentation by conducting their own surveys and writing down what they identified as indigenous customary law. The resulting copious records are what enables modern historians to imagine what indigenous law might have looked like even before Europeans invaded the continent (see Chapter 2).\n\nAlthough the motivation of those collecting and writing down data on indigenous customs could vary, the jurists and ecclesiastics who took part in these endeavors largely followed the same procedures as their European equivalents in the preceding centuries. Judging their task as essential to the integration of multiple communities into a “jurisdictional state” – which, in the colonial setting, also included a variety of ethnicities – jurists and clergymen gathered information, observed what they could, and wrote down what seemed most relevant, appropriate, and just, while also endeavoring to transform it into something familiar and comprehensible. In the surveys they conducted, they sometimes used indigenous informants and witnesses, as well as indigenous mnemonic devices. However, they often relied on the expertise of Spaniards, either settlers or ecclesiastics, who were said to be familiar with indigenous peoples and their customs.\n\nSome colonial actors clearly advocated in favor of indigenous customs, which they believed were an antidote to chaos; others criticized them bitterly, believing them pagan, unjust, or simply unwise. But whatever their attitude, like their predecessors in Europe, all those recording customs in the colonies tended to decontextualize and de-historicize the evidence they collected. They distinguished good customs (which should persist because they were compatible with divine and natural law and the main tenets of ius commune) from bad ones (which should be prohibited). Although colonial recorders acknowledged the existence of a huge variety of customs among indigenous peoples, as their European equivalents had done in the “Old World,” they nonetheless tended to reduce the customs’ complexity, and to portray them as belonging to a single normative universe by turning concrete examples into general rules. The result was that, in the process of recording, these actors also modified what they had found. They allowed European law as applied in the colonies to absorb indigenous customs but, in the aftermath, neither indigenous customs nor European law were ever the same.\n\nThe Spanish officials who engaged in these campaigns were driven by a bias in favor of European alphabetical writing and believed that this was the only technology that would enable the conservation of indigenous customs. They expressed their fear that, unless they proceeded as they did, many indigenous customs would be “lost,” because indigenous peoples had no system to write down their own laws. According to this view, due to the lack of written collections, indigenous people could not account for their customs; they could only repeat what their ancestors had done. Some Spaniards concluded that it was “almost impossible” to find out the truth about indigenous customs, because an authoritative compilation – a “general history of the customs of the Indians of Peru,” for example – was lacking.\n\nThe belief that indigenous customs must be recorded led Spaniards to pay attention also to indigenous methods of recollection. In testimonies collected in Cuzco in 1582, for example, multiple witnesses explained that the indigenous peoples of Peru had their own systems of registration, which had “secretaries” sing (!) the information on laws and ordinances while holding a Khipu in their hands. Khipus were colorful knotted cords that, as far as we presently know, included information that was numerical, legal, and perhaps also literary and historical. It identified kinship organization and communities and narrated their privileges. According to several colonial testimonies, Khipus sometimes included information on Inca law, and not only reflected reality but contributed to its making, because they allowed not only the preservation of the memory of the past but also planning and distribution of resources in the future.\n\nPrecolonial in origin, Khipus continued to be produced during the colonial period, though their presence somewhat diminished from the 1590s, and starkly decreased from the mid-seventeenth century onwards. In the early period, the Spanish authorities often ordered that the contents of Khipus be transcribed into Spanish-type documentation, and colonial judges routinely accepted Khipus as valid proof. To admit Khipus as evidence, indigenous experts (Khipucamayocs) who had them in their possession testified to their contents in the courts. We know that litigants and judges who heard these expert testimonies assumed that Khipus contained facts about past events, but they also tended to believe that these historical accounts had normative dimensions. Khipus were thus seen in the early modern period as reflecting the indigenous management of justice and order, perhaps even law, and as records of decisions that were categorized as jurisdictional because they declared and applied the law. Belief in the veracity of Khipus was such that, on occasions, Spanish judges demanded to hear what Khipus, which they described as “truthful and correct,” indicated. In 1575, Viceroy Toledo ordered Khipus to be collected, and instructed the Khipucamayocs, who by that stage were considered notaries (escribanos), to write down their contents so that the information would be “more certain and durable.”\n\nAndeans were not the only indigenous peoples to record information in forms that appeared alien to the colonizers yet were considered reliable. Mayan elites presented colonial magistrates with information recorded using traditional hieroglyphic scripts that captured historical accounts as well as evidence regarding communities and land rights. During the colonial period, those trained to read these scripts were recognized as notaries. Many of them produced both Spanish and Maya documentation, as well as mixed texts that, written in Spanish, incorporated Maya style, forms of address, measurements, numerals, and classifiers, or that, though written in indigenous languages, used Spanish alphabetical script.\n\nAztec authorities and litigants relied on indigenous painted histories to keep information safe. Considered faithful recollections of the past, these paintings were admissible in colonial courts and accepted as reliable evidence for claims regarding the rights of communities to certain lands, or of families to certain leadership positions. Perhaps because these instruments seemed so foreign, Spaniards sometimes questioned whether they only included facts or also normative knowledge. Vasco de Quiroga (1477/78–1565), for example, argued in 1535 that the indigenous peoples of Mexico did not have “ordinances” nor laws and that their paintings only represented records of past events. By contrast, his contemporary Bernardino de Sahagún (c. 1499–1590) believed that Aztec paintings were like writing and contained information on litigation, laws, and customs.\n\nDespite preference for written over oral transmission, and despite the push to record indigenous customs in (alphabetical or other) writing, colonial courts, both Spanish and indigenous, were constantly called upon to apply indigenous law as reconstructed by the declarations of witnesses. However, historians who have studied how this worked in practice argue that Spanish officials who claimed to decide cases according to indigenous customary law actually curated a new law that no indigenous individual would have easily recognized (see also Chapter 2). These officials were not ethnographers seeking to discover what indigenous law mandated, but behaved as early modern judges did elsewhere, namely, they searched for what they considered was the just result, using the methods discussed earlier. They thus applied to indigenous law their own judgment of what justice required. For example, they supported the nomination of heirs to leadership positions according to patriarchal principles and linked the right to land with possession. The Spanish administrative authorities followed suit, despite frequently insisting – even as they sought to control or alter indigenous customs – that their orders were not meant to change the customary law. Instead, they claimed that colonial administrators and judges were merely continuing and repeating “ancient” indigenous legal practices.\n\nIndigenous judges and litigants were often similarly creative in inventing or shaping customs according to present needs while at the same time claiming to be following long-established practices. Rather than focusing on preserving their ancient traditions or expressing allegiance to the past, they translated and adapted old practices to new realities in pursuit of what they considered just and followed the strategies to which they attributed the greatest chances of success. Indigenous judges, influenced by colonial conditions as well as Christianity, and often presiding over communities composed of members from a plurality of origins, mixed elements from various traditions. In the process, they created a law that was certainly local but was neither authentic nor necessarily old – in contrast to what they sometimes argued and what historians used to assert.\n\nIndigenous authorities also contributed to disseminating knowledge about Spanish law. On occasions, they or local scribes were responsible for translating Spanish norms into local languages, or preparing collections of law for local use. Comparison of what they produced with the Spanish originals demonstrates that, while their work enabled Spanish concepts and norms to penetrate locally, it also ensured their adaptation to local concepts, idioms, and possibilities, for example, by stressing orality, by adding commentaries, or by referring to customs, distinguishing between those that should be maintained (because they were “good”) from those which must not. In other words, like Spanish judges, indigenous judges were involved in processes of cultural (and legal) translation and searched for a just solution (see Sections 1.3 and 1.4).\n\nIndigenous litigants learned to use the colonizers’ language of “customs” to refer to their own normativity. They defended some customs as “good” and thus valid and classified others as “bad” and therefore no longer prescriptive. They invoked custom, which they often categorized as “immemorial,” to justify new habits and argued – in line with the European understanding of the term – that immemoriality required that there would be “nothing in human memory to contradict it.” Thus, indigenous judicial practices and concepts substantially changed during the colonial period not just due to the adherence to Spanish law but also through the transformation of indigenous normativity into a European style “customary law.”\n\nIn other words, whether written down or applied by the courts, in Spanish America as in Europe, customs were both a means of preserving local normativity and a motor for change. The early modern European concept of customary law allowed for the integration of a wide range of jurisdictions – in this case, indigenous communities and their laws – into a ius commune, but both customs and the common law were modified as a result. Historians have thus concluded that one can consider colonial indigenous customs as the outcome of complex processes involving local agency, juridical mediation, and an ongoing conversation regarding what was local and what was global, what was permissible and what was prohibited, what was written down, and what remained oral. Customs both European and indigenous, new or old, communally based, reimagined by jurists, or mandated by kings, formed part of a complex legal universe in which a great variety of norms competed but also, according to the contemporary understanding of ius commune, cohered.\n\nWhile there is ample information on how these processes operated in Spanish America, we still lack data regarding the equivalent developments in Luso-America. Nonetheless, there is reason to believe that similar processes occurred. Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not formally acknowledge the validity of indigenous jurisdictions or indigenous law. However, in Portuguese territories, too, indigenous leaders (principais) substantially contributed to the maintenance of order within indigenous communities and therefore must also have engaged in declaring and applying the law. This must have been the case throughout the colonial period, though indigenous jurisdictional powers possibly intensified after the mid-eighteenth-century reforms that tasked indigenous village councils and justices of the peace (juiz ordinário) with adjudicating conflicts. Though this theoretically transformed the indigenous population into vassals and subjected them to Portuguese law, there is some evidence that indigenous judges continued to be influenced by indigenous legal concepts. Our ignorance of how this transpired is mostly explained by the limitations of the source material, which is either scarce or nonexistent.\n\nAfro-Latin American Customs in Colonial Latin America\n\nWhereas indigenous law has been the object of ample research, at least with respect to Spanish America, the literature has yet to ask questions regarding the presence of African law in the Iberian empires’ American colonies. The current assumption among historians of both Spanish and Portuguese America is that enslaved Afro-Latin Americans lacked opportunities to exercise their laws and that those who achieved freedom mostly sought to integrate into colonial society by, among other things, abandoning their distinct traditions. However, colonial documentation often demonstrates the persistence among Afro-Latin Americans of a wide variety of African legal practices, originating in different groups and areas, or sometimes developed in colonial cities in Africa where enslaved persons could spend years before they were sent to the Americas (on these issues, see Section 1.4). One of the elements that can be traced to specific regions in Africa is the use in colonial Latin America of rituals of divination and ordeals to decide who committed a crime or to discover stolen goods. In these instances, spiritual specialists functioned as judges in settings comparable to trials. Similarly, social problems, including what was considered social deviance, could be solved by using a “cult of affliction,” which involved communicating with spirits said to both cause the problem and be in a position to solve it. These rites justified many of the powers held by leaders and explained why their instructions were followed. It is also possible that the formation of colonial families was greatly influenced both by a particular African definition of family and by their openness to integrate outsiders, including former enslaved persons or their offspring, into them. This likely also affected experiences how and when freedom could be achieved, and what it entailed. Afro-Latin Americans, in other words, used as well as manipulated their multifaceted heritage to cope with slavery as well as with living in a colonial society.\n\nThere is also reason to believe that specifically African legal notions might have operated in maroon communities, where escaped enslaved persons and freed Afro-Latin Americans created new political, social, and judicial structures, and followed their own norms. Though we still know very little about how these communities operated, there are plenty of indications that they were led by specific individuals or kin groups, who managed them as true “republics.” At least, both the Spanish and the Portuguese believed such was the case and treated maroon leaders as “governors” who controlled both people and territory. According to the colonial sources’ portrayal, these leaders had power over subjects, distributed work, and administered criminal justice, either personally or through judges. Many maroon communities seem to have had norms distinguishing members from outsiders, as well as procedures for accommodating and integrating newcomers.\n\nOf course, we do not know if these legal arrangements were based on European, indigenous, or African notions, or perhaps some combination of them all, but it is hard to imagine that the African heritage of the communities’ leaders or members, most particularly in the first generations, did not affect their choices. A number of historians have suggested this might have been the case, pointing to similarities between what transpired in maroon communities and normative systems in some parts of Africa. For example, ritual behavior that recognized subjection to local leaders identified as kings, such as prostration at their feet or applauding, was common in Congo and Angola, and has also been reported for maroon communities in Ibero-America. Equally striking is the presence in some maroon communities of African kilombo, a custom that enabled the social, religious, political, and perhaps also legal integration of younger males by mandating their temporary separation from the community in order to prepare them to become warriors and full community members. It is also clear that African linguistic elements were present in many maroon communities, and it seems reasonable to assume that these also communicated values and concepts, including some pertaining to the law.\n\nAfro-Latin Americans living in maroon communities could both rely on normative knowledge obtained before enslavement and utilize what they had learned after they had been captured while waiting for the ships in African ports; second-generation enslaved persons could gather information from newcomers, or they could depend on diasporic customs that evolved in the Americas. Yet, most historians warn us against concluding that maroon communities were true African states where renegades sought to revive African traditions, as some have argued. Clearly, these communities were new creations in which new African diasporic customs – with roots in multiple locations and social or ethnic groups – might have emerged, and where a diversity of customs of African origin came into intense contact with Iberian and possibly also indigenous legal traditions.\n\nCustoms: European, Indigenous, and Afro-Latin American Entanglements\n\nIt is therefore fair to say that, though indigenous peoples clearly had their own laws before Europeans invaded the continent, as did Afro-Latin Americans before they endured enslavement, during the colonial period these normativities underwent dramatic transformations. These substantial and dynamic changes mean that, while colonial documentation can help us to imagine the precolonial indigenous order (see Chapter 2) and to explain what transpired during the colonial period (and may even, on occasion, illuminate what occurred during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries), it cannot give us definitive answers as to what originated from where. Like all normativities, indigenous and African laws changed over time, but in addition, they were also greatly modified by the intense dialogue with other legal traditions, regardless of whether this dialogue was imposed (as many have rightly observed) or voluntary, and regardless of asymmetries in power relations.\n\nMore easily traceable in the Spanish territories, but most likely to some degree also taking place in Portuguese America, processes of change, hybridization, translation, concretization, and reinvention had their local and group particularities, yet they also shared much in common with similar processes transpiring elsewhere in the Iberian world. On both sides of the ocean, in both Spanish and Portuguese territories, communal authorities – but also outsiders, such as the central authorities in the Peninsula or the colonizers in America – sought to identify, control, and change the customary law. By pronouncing what this law included and, on occasion, by writing it down, multiple agents confirmed both the existence of local variations, which they identified as “customary,” and the importance of a common framework.\n\nIndigenous and Afro-Latin Americans, of course, also greatly contributed to the formation of colonial law – not only by inserting their own customs, but also by engaging with European Spanish and Portuguese law. They did so as authorities endowed with jurisdiction and as individuals in their daily activities or in court. Their contributions to the development of colonial law of European origin cannot be overestimated. Interpretations of European law by local actors introduced a huge variety of new understandings and customs – perhaps not necessarily of indigenous or African origin, but nonetheless colonial (see Sections 1.3 and 1.4 and Chapter 2). Indigenous litigants and agents, for example, redefined the meaning and extent of their status as protected individuals. They extended the use of entailed estates to cover situations in which indigenous leaders argued for historical rights to land based on their nobility. These and other actions led to the development of a corpus of jurisprudence regarding indigenous leadership positions (cacicazgo) that relied on European debates and notions but took them in novel directions. Some indigenous individuals gained sufficient literacy to intervene in Spanish courts on behalf of their communities, pushing for solutions that used Spanish terminology and Spanish frameworks, yet promoted new ideas. Freed Afro-Latin Americans did the same, arguing against their discrimination, for example, by advancing different interpretations of what being worthy of the rights and duties of vassals, Spaniards, or Portuguese, meant. Particularly fascinating is the contribution of enslaved persons who, by appealing to the courts, greatly affected the meaning of the legal concepts of both slavery and freedom. They did so by using legal arguments to claim a space between one status and the other, by living as free despite their status as enslaved persons, and by following practices that allowed them to gradually free themselves. These contributions not only clarified what the different statuses were, they also brought about new ideas regarding the obligations and rights of different members of society.\n\nIn addition to colonized indigenous individuals’ contributions to and entanglements with colonial law, indigenous law also existed side-by-side with colonial law. This was the case in indigenous communities that maintained their autonomy and independence during the colonial period, including those inhabiting much of the Southern Cone as well as the Chocó and Amazon regions. These communities continued to use their own laws, laws that until the present have not been sufficiently studied. From records produced by the Spanish and the Portuguese when they attempted to befriend or enter into alliances with these groups, it is evident that Europeans generally failed to appreciate the diverse legal traditions of these independent communities, believing instead that European law should apply because, according to them, it had universal validity.\n\nConclusion: How to Reconstruct Colonial Law\n\nThe previous discussion has shown that to understand colonial law, we need to place it in dialogue with European law. We also need to know more about both indigenous American precolonial law and Afro-Latin American law and trace the processes that led to their reinvention under imperial rule. However, though consideration of these longer and larger contexts is vital, so is attention to place, time, and the specific parties involved: We need to explore how these frameworks operated in a particular setting. It is therefore clear that we can neither imagine colonial law as entirely separate and distinct from European law nor simply equate it with royal orders. Neither can we forget the role of normative sources such as juridical discussions, canon law, theology, or customary law. To imagine a derecho indiano that was particularly Spanish, to envision a distinct Portuguese colonial law, or to separate royal decision-making from the principles that it sought to implement, is to give life to a strawman.\n\nThese findings enable us to assess the validity of the various methods by which historians have previously tried to reconstruct colonial law (see Section 1.1). Studying the royal decrees, as many have done in the past, is of course possible, but only if we take into account that these were jurisdictional acts that reflected not only royal objectives or social, economic, and political interests (as has often been asserted) but also normative debates. Examining what the various Recopilaciones included is equally plausible, but it requires bearing in mind that these compilations were indexes or summaries, and that the fragments they reproduced were taken out of context, might not have been cited correctly, and lacked references to the debates that led to their enactment. Studying Solórzano is a must, but this, too, can be done only as long as one recalls that his work, like the Siete Partidas in the thirteenth century, was no more than an attempt – ingenious, informed, and logical, yet still only a suggestion – as to how to fit a pan-European ius commune to the demands of place and time. Interrogating case law is just as important, but this, too, requires considering the juridical debates and disagreements upon which it relied. As Vasco de Quiroga argued already in 1535, listing examples (in his case, solutions adopted by case law or in royal orders) is not the same as understanding the principles that governed them. Only by placing all these pieces of evidence of a long-gone juridical past in their early modern legal context will we be able to understand what they tell us.\n\nA Final Word about the Global Context\n\nThese characteristics of early modern law operated in colonial Latin America, but – as mentioned throughout this text – they were also typical of Europe. As a result, it is easy to imagine that other European powers that colonized parts of the Americas, Asia, or Africa during the early modern period equally followed them. These powers also asked whether metropolitan law could be implemented in the colonies and how it must be adapted to colonial conditions. They discussed whether it was advisable and/or possible to incorporate indigenous law and how to distinguish what of the latter could be integrated from what must be rejected. While many similarities are evident, the biggest difficulty in inserting Latin American narratives into the larger story of law and European colonialism is not that the various imperial pasts were different, but the huge differences in the relevant historiographical traditions, which focus on different questions and use different methodologies. Scholars of colonial North America, for example, have concentrated on understanding the laws that applied to settlers, traditionally saying relatively little about other normativities, which they sometimes assumed were in some profound way external to the colonial legal system. The literature on New France largely follows this approach, though it is somewhat more open to recognizing the existence of indigenous communities and their laws. Meanwhile, the most recent literature on Portuguese colonialism in Asia and Africa has been particularly focused on recuperating a colonial law that was neither European nor indigenous, but extremely entangled. These studies narrate, for example, how Portuguese law interacted with African and Asian laws in Portuguese enclaves (such as Angola or Goa, for example), and with what results, and how the authorities and residents of these locations responded. They highlight not only important commonalities but also the prevalence of local norms.\n\nGiven these historiographical differences, it is currently impossible to productively compare the legal experiences of colonizers and colonized in the different European powers’ overseas territories. Indeed, where such a comparison has been attempted, the results, by repeating what the existing literature described without subjecting it to critical examination, have often reified the differences rather than the commonalities between different colonial experiences, or have focused on what transpired during the colonial period, without necessarily understanding the principles that enabled it. Thus, although scholars working on European colonialism in Latin America and elsewhere have asked many important questions regarding colonial law, we still have much to ask, learn, and understand.\n\n. . .\n\n3.2 Religious Normativity for Colonial Empires\n\nMany legal histories of colonial Latin America begin with the bulls issued by Alexander VI in May of 1493. A member of the notorious Borgia family, and born near Valencia, he granted special rights and duties to the so-called Catholic Kings in relation to territories known today as Latin America and the Caribbean. Modeled on previous privileges granted to the Portuguese Crown and to the Portuguese Order of Christ for expansion (extra territorium) along the African coast and into Asia, these bulls were based on the idea that the pope exercised dominium over the entire world. To substantiate this claim, the papacy could draw on a century-old juridical debate about the rights of the pope, the legal status of non-Christians, and the legitimacy of war, the so-called bellum iustum. While the Treaty of Tordesillas, concluded between the Portuguese and Spanish Crowns in 1494, did introduce some changes, it was based on the same foundation, followed medieval juridical practices, and was confirmed by Pope Julius II in 1506. Spreading the gospel, missionizing infideles, as well as developing, sustaining, and protecting the Church thus became a central justification for the Iberian empires’ imperial politics. For centuries, and notwithstanding the famous debates about the juridical titles of the Spanish Crown triggered by Francisco de Vitoria and other theologians from the School of Salamanca, both empires claimed the papal donation as the primary legitimation of their imperial rule in the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Pacific.\n\nThe fact that European expansion to Latin America and the subsequent empire-building was legitimized with reference to papal bulls – not to mention that the harshest criticism of this legitimation came from theologians – points to the importance of religion for the legal history of Latin America. Even more than in the European territories, the kings of Spain and Portugal saw themselves as patrons of the Catholic Church in their overseas dominions, and thus they felt obliged to foster missionary activities and act as protectors of the Church. If the idea of a Respublica Christiana was deeply rooted in medieval political theory and had already legitimized the war against the Arabs on the Iberian Peninsula during the High Middle Ages, the entitlement to christianize the so-called infidels in the Americas made it a guiding principle of the entire colonial enterprise.\n\nHowever, it was not only the religious legitimation of the expansion as such or the patronage of the kings over the Church that made religion a central facet of colonial rule. Religious symbols, language, and practices – that is, knowledge of normativity from the religious sphere (see Section 1.3) – shaped everyday life. Sacraments structured one’s life from birth to death. Catalogs of sins and virtues contained norms for behavior, confession was a regular practice, and religious celebrations were essential elements of urban and rural conviviality. Long before they ever crossed paths with a jurist or a Crown official, many indigenous peoples had already encountered and, in many cases, lived amongst missionaries and priests. Through religious precepts and prohibitions – in catechesis, in the confessional, in school, in images, in pictographs, in performances like processions, and in choral singing – indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, and Asian Americans learned the language and the culture of the European colonizers. They were introduced to what Christian faith presented as good and evil, just and unjust, permissible and impermissible. Sexual behavior, marital practices, and food consumption were all subject to and regulated by religious norms. Moreover, many cultural and social categories stemmed from religion and established social and political hierarchies. Whether one was classified as a neophyte, as an old or new Christian, was a member of the clergy, or was granted privileges and dispensations, had a profound impact on one’s opportunities in life. Church courts presided over cases concerning marital violence, alimony claims, and even crimes. Because ecclesiastical institutions provided loans and sometimes partook in large business enterprises, some disputes taken to the ecclesiastical courts involved substantial amounts of money. Religion also influenced and shaped secular law: Punishment could be more lenient if one was considered a good Christian, and what was just or unjust was determined according to the precepts of religion and with the help of the doctrines of moral theology. Bishops, religious orders, ecclesiastical judges, confessors, confraternities, and many other institutions of the Church ceaselessly produced knowledge of normativity via ecclesiastical courts, at synods and councils, through ordinances, statutes, catechesis, preaching, counseling, and in the confessional.\n\nEven in the late eighteenth century – when the influence of the Church in many places was on the wane, the Jesuits were expelled, and Enlightenment thinking questioned the role of religion – public discourse and the law remained profoundly shaped by religious semantics. After independence, “political catechisms” served to teach the new citizens the ten commandments of the republic, symbolizing the ambivalent secularization of religious forms under the conditions of modern states. More than a few states declared themselves “Catholic” nations, and some constitutions have retained privileges for the Catholic Church to this day. The fact that the Catholic Church, and increasingly other Christian confessions, played an important role in political life in the twentieth century shows the long-lasting effects of the religious dimension of Iberian imperial politics (see Chapter 4 and Sections 5.1 and 6.2).\n\nAll of this has not gone unnoticed. Since Robert Ricard wrote about the conquête spirituelle almost a century ago, scholars have been very aware of the importance of religion, especially for building up colonial society. Yet in the literature on legal history, very few references to canon law and moral theology are found, or to the importance of secular clergy and religious orders. Even less common are references to the role of the Roman Curia and to globally active religious orders. This lack of attention is probably due to the legalistic character of both the historiography on the so-called Derecho indiano and Portuguese colonial legal history, and their focus on state institutions. Just as the theory of the patronato – and later vicariato – placed the monarchy above the Church, Church institutions and thus knowledge of normativity from the religious sphere seemed to have been absorbed by secular institutions and law. However, this has all started to change as a result of new interpretations on the role of religion in early modern Iberian (legal) history, understanding colonial society in terms of a jurisdictional culture based on ideas of material justice deeply rooted in Christian discourse (see Sections 1.1, 1.2, and 3.1), and in no small part due to the research findings of cultural and social history. Legal historians are beginning to discover the role of institutions such as charitable confraternities, church courts, synods, and provincial councils for legal history.\n\nNotwithstanding these developments, the way these institutions operated and the knowledge they built upon is not easy to understand. There are only a handful of introductions to the history of canon law dedicated to the early modern period, and even fewer to Latin America. Research on the history of mission and (moral) theology is often unknown to legal historians. Therefore, this section aims to provide some basic information about the bodies of knowledge of normativity from the religious sphere, about techniques of localizing canon law, and the institutional framework within which actors moved. It assumes that legal history can best be understood as a huge process of translation of knowledge of normativity, as explained in Section 1.3, and thus provides introductory information about the institutions – or “epistemic communities” – that produced knowledge of normativity relevant for the religious sphere, as well as on the knowledge of normativity from the religious sphere as such.\n\nThough other religions were of course present in Latin America, this Section’s focus is on the Catholic Church. Indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, and Asian Americans brought to the Americas as captives or enslaved persons, as well as people of Jewish ancestry, practiced their religions and followed the laws and precepts of their beliefs in the Americas. Despite severe immigration controls, even some Protestants came to the Americas starting in the sixteenth century, and their numbers increased with the acceleration of trade in the late eighteenth century. However, as indigenous religions, crypto-Judaists, and Protestants were persecuted, and non-Catholic religious practices classified as superstition, their impact on public life was limited. Similarly, while Protestant communities in Dutch Brazil even held a synod in 1642, their presence between 1621 and 1654 ultimately remained an interlude. This is why the focus of the following analysis is on the bodies of knowledge of normativity stemming from the Catholic Church. Within this context, the oldest and richest repository of knowledge of normativity was the ius canonicum, that is, the law of the Catholic Church. Without some basic information about canon law, it is neither possible to understand the administration of justice in the Church nor the emergence of moral theology as a powerful second layer of knowledge of normativity in the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Repository of Knowledge of Normativity: Universal Canon Law\n\nCanon law goes back to the beginnings of the Church and consisted over the course of the first few centuries primarily of texts by Church fathers, constitutions of Church councils, and fragments from Scripture. Soon, papal responses to inquiries in legal matters (so-called decretals) and, since the eleventh century, canon law scholars furthered its development. With the mass of authoritative statements growing continuously, scholars, bishops, and later the Roman Curia selected and integrated parts of this heritage into collections of canons. An important part of this legacy was included in the Decretum Gratiani from the first half of the twelfth century and supplemented by the ius novum, that is, law from the period of “classical” canon law between the twelfth and mid-fourteenth centuries. In 1234, a part of this new canon law was selected, integrated into a systematic structure, and edited as Liber extra, which was a particularly influential, authoritative collection of more recent papal decretals. Other collections eventually followed (Liber Sextus, Clementinae).\n\nBetween the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, scholarship on canon law flourished. Canonists wrote glosses and extensive treatises on specific problems. Their writings enjoyed a high level of authority, not least because in practice papal decretals and even collections required recognition by scholars for their acceptance. Popes sent the collections containing “new law” to universities, where it was up to the scholars to integrate them into their writings and teaching. One consequence of this practice was that the opinion of scholars acquired the status of a source of law. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, a complex body of knowledge of normativity had emerged that was comparable to the so-called ius civile, that is, the “civil” or secular law elaborated by medieval jurisprudence based on Roman law. Even if the ius canonicum was clearly distinguished from the ius civile, together with this and some other bodies of knowledge of normativity, it formed the ius commune.\n\nShortly after 1500, the most important elements of this canon law tradition were compiled by a publisher to form the Corpus Iuris Canonici, which, as the designation indicates, was to stand alongside the Corpus Iuris Civilis. Many printed editions from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries also included a short textbook modeled on the institutions of Roman law, the Institutiones Iuris Canonici by Giovanni Paolo Lancelotti (1522–90). This convergence of the forms was no accident. The relationship between canon and secular law was complex. Though their evolution over the centuries involved constant exchange, they were nevertheless quite distinct. Partly as the result of this co-evolution and mutual interdependence, a popular introduction to the study of law published in Salamanca at the beginning of the seventeenth century compared secular and canon law to a pair of gloves: having just one is of very little use.\n\nGiven that the Council of Trent (1545–1563) was marked by the Catholic Church’s attempts to counter the Reformation and implement reforms in the Church and the Roman Curia, and bishops from Hispanic America had asked the king in vain for permission to participate, the Council did not explicitly dedicate itself to the mission in Latin America. Nonetheless, important areas of canon law were discussed and further developed, and the decisions of the Council are actually of great relevance to Latin American legal history. The Council took place during a period in which the Church was consolidating its structures in Latin America, and it simultaneously produced both centralizing and pluralizing effects in the Catholic Church at the global level. It both strengthened the centrality of the Roman Curia, for example, by attempting to monopolize the interpretation of canon law through the prohibition of commenting on the Council’s canons. At the same time, it fortified the position of local bishops and created the framework for Catholicism as a world religion. In many respects, it was through the provincial councils and synods that Tridentine canon law was translated into Latin American realities.\n\nAs part of the attempts to centralize the administration of justice in the realm of the Catholic Church in the aftermath of the Council, an official edition of the Corpus Iuris Canonici was produced. This Editio Romana, the work of a group of cardinals and scholars known as the Correctores Romani, was part of the move to reformulate important normative texts of Church life in the post-Tridentine period. These texts included the Catechismus Romanus (1566), the Breviarium Romanum (1568), the Missale Romanum (1570), the Pontificale Romanum (1596), the Caeremoniale Episcoporum (1600), and the Rituale Romanum (1614). These texts were tools for evangelization and counter-reformation, and they also served as normative foundations for a renewal of the symbolic power of the Catholic Church. The publication of the Catechismus Romanus was particularly important for Latin America, as it influenced the numerous catechisms written in the late sixteenth- and throughout the seventeenth century, especially those by provincial councils in Lima and Mexico and by religious congregations. These catechisms were translated into many different indigenous languages. Despite the fact that they are full of rules, prohibitions, and commandments, little attention has been paid to them as a source for legal history.\n\nThe Council of Trent also brought about important changes in the role of legal scholarship on canon law in the production of knowledge of normativity. At first glance, however, not too much appeared to have changed. Since commentaries on the decrees of the Council of Trent were forbidden, canonists’ writings, and to some extent Church practice, followed the structure of the Liber extra and, in some cases, in the later period the order of Lancelotti’s Institutiones. The Cursus iuris canonici, hispani, et indici by the Jesuit Pedro Murillo Velarde from the Philippines – printed in 1743, 1763, and 1791 – represented the most comprehensive account of canon law in the Spanish empire and was still based on the order of the Liber extra. Some synods and provincial councils also arranged their decisions in accordance with this structure. Thus, medieval canon law had not only shaped the order of knowledge before Trent, it also continued to provide the intellectual structure into which the increasingly specialized proto-national variations and appropriations of universal canon law were integrated.\n\nIn a similar vein, the reference to pre-Tridentine authorities remained an important scholarly practice. The general opinion of scholars (communis opinio doctorum) and recognized authors (probati auctores) were still important sources of law for the practice of canon law in Latin America as well as in Europe. This is why, for example, Gaspar de Villarroel, bishop of Santiago de Chile, pointed out in the introduction to his treatise on good governance of the Church in the Indies, the Govierno eclesiastico pacifico (1656–1657), that the purpose of his book was to put “a whole library” at the reader’s disposal. He did so because he was convinced that a decision could only be reached in a responsible manner if it was based on a thorough examination of the authorities of canon law. A century later, in 1744, Pope Benedict XIV chided the archbishop of Santo Domingo in a response to a practical legal question raised by the archbishop that the opinio communis doctorum could not simply be dismissed. The practical need for arguments and orientation in legal matters – perhaps also the interest of the Curia in counteracting the centrifugal tendencies in canon law associated with the formation of what were eventually referred to as “national” Churches – was also served by reference works such as Lucio Ferraris’ Prompta bibliotheca canonica. First published in 1746 (and many times thereafter), it assembled the opinions of the most relevant scholars on matters of canon law and was organized around hundreds of entries in alphabetical order. These and other, less erudite media served as repositories for the knowledge of normativity required to find the right solution to a specific case. Research on the circulation of books and on holdings of libraries has shown that many of these works were available in Latin America in monasteries, seminaries, and universities.\n\nNotwithstanding this apparent stability of scholarly practices and content, the Council of Trent also introduced important changes. Many of these reforms went into effect in the decades that followed. Most importantly, the Council of Trent sought to monopolize the interpretation of canon law and to centralize the amendment and reform process at the Curia, especially in the newly founded Congregation of the Council. From that point onward, the most important new scholarly books, such as the commentary on the Liber Extra by Prospero Fagnani (who was himself active in the Congregation of the Council) or the Theatrum veritatis et iustitiae (1669–1673) by Giovanni Battista de Luca, drew primarily on the sentences of the Rota Romana, that is, the so-called decisiones of the highest court of the Roman Catholic Church. Not least the Congregation Propaganda Fide, founded in 1622 to promote evangelization all across the globe, issued numerous regulations that became the basis for the growing missionary law. Its impact, however, was different in the Spanish and the Portuguese empires. As the mission in Spanish America had already started and been well developed prior to the foundation of the Propaganda Fide, due to the patronato regio and the fact that the Tridentine reforms had already been introduced, the Hispanic American territories were not considered to be under the jurisdiction of the Congregation. With regard to Portuguese America, however, the Holy See often considered the patronato regio to be ineffective and claimed jurisdiction over these territories, granting authority to the Propaganda Fide. In addition to these institutions, a Nunciatura Apostólica de las Españas had been created in 1529, replaced in 1769 by the Tribunal de la Rota de la Nunciatura Apostólica en España. Both institutions exercised jurisdiction over and continuously created knowledge of normativity for the Spanish empire. These are but a few examples of how the Roman Curia developed institutions and practices for the governance of what was becoming a worl"
