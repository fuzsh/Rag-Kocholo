        "text": "1. Unraveling the Threads\n\n3 Let us start with a story from the back of the trunk : Ana Bernal de Miranda flaunted through the streets of Bahia, reversing the established order. She had worn her crimson skirt with golden branches and her silk jerkin with lace cuffs ; she had fastened some crystal buttons on the upper part of her garment ; she had tightened her earrings inlaid with gold and diamonds, gleaming like the skeins of the small and thin seed-pearl with a small cross that she carried around her neck. She had put on her woman’s gloves ; graceful, she exposed above all else one of the new periwigs that she kept in her residence, in the freguesia de São Pedro Velho, located outside the walls of Salvador, Bahia.\n\n7 The codes of distinction intended to normalize the space according to the criteria of skin color and social stratification, in conformity with coeval fictions. Miscegenation was a risk, because it made it difficult to observe the « quality » of people. The sign of the Ancien Régime was rooted on hierarchies and depended on them. Thus, the uses described for Ana Bernal de Miranda could also imply an Old Christian ancestry, but certainly imply appanage of nobility and the courtly model. In any case, Ana kept her clothes and periwigs at home, along with her garments and other trappings of the Ancien Régime’s economy of appearances. It was customary to keep everything in the trunk or in the multifunctional chest, to which we will return later.\n\n8 The Castilian Ana Bernal de Miranda arrived in Salvador when she was four to five years old and spent most of her life in this important colonial city. She was the youngest child of Izabel Bernal and doctor Francisco Nunes de Miranda and had eight legitimate siblings, of whom one died shipwrecked on a journey from Bahia to the University of Coimbra and two did not make it past the tender age.\n\n10 Originally from Vilar Torpim, his brother Manuel Nunes Bernal was single and invested in a maritime career, achieving a meteoric professional rise : from ship captain he rose to sea and war captain of the Royal Navy and, subsequently, to commissary of convoy frigates and Coast Guard of Bahia, Guinea and Angola (1736). The celerity was due to royal favors granted by King Dom João V (1706-1750), the aid was owing to the port expedition of Cabinda, in Angola (1723), in which he achieved a remarkable victory against the English forces. The captain presented himself to the ministers of the Inquisition guilty of Judaism in 1727, as did his sister Maria, as soon as news of Ana’s arrest in Salvador reached Rio.\n\n12 It is worth mentioning the existence of three other people : Maria, a « natural » sister, the product of Francis’ clandestine love affairs when he was single, about whom the documents did not give any information ; as well as António and João, baptized by the couple in Castelo Rodrigo in the 1680s. The first one became a soldier, then a cavalry lieutenant, and died while on duty in the squares of Alentejo. The second one graduated at the University of Coimbra with a degree in Medicine and leveraged his medical career. Raised among the others, over time, the two would spend seasons at the house of the fidalgo (nobleman) Pedro Machado de Brito, an Old Christian lieutenant general in the kingdom. There was collusion between the said nobleman and our characters, in order to raise suspicions about the paternity of these two boys.\n\n14 Ana Bernal de Miranda resided in Bahia for almost three decades, before her arrest in 1726. In that city she joined in marriage to the merchant and businessman Joseph da Costa, probably without leaving descendants. Her husband was from the Lusitanian court, son of the Portuguese Beatriz Pereira and the Italian Andre Vareda, and he had wandered with his family since an early age in the Iberian Peninsula. When crossing the Atlantic, he bowed to colonial business and life on board, taken to the meanders of the sea by his future brother-in-law Manuel Bernal. The conviviality between the New Christian stirps was strengthened with the arrival of the mother-in-law Beatriz, then widow of the Italian, and of the sister-in-law Luísa Maria Rosa, betrothed to the merchant João Gomes de Carvalho, who had permanently moved, carrying all their belongings. They lived with Ana, and by that time « Mirandinha » was represented well adorned in Bahian society and had a reasonable financial situation. Despite their social position, both lineages were publicly held by New Christians.\n\n2. Defiled Blood\n\n15 Let us briefly dwell on the socio-legal category in which the families were placed. Unevenly spread to overseas domains, the topic of blood purity guided Iberian society between the XVth and XVIIIth centuries. New Christians were considered unclean and had to face a series of restrictions. The underlying qualification was conceived in the mid-XIVth century to separate the descendants of Moors, Blacks and Jews from the « legitimate » Christians, based on juridical-theological discourse. In this paper, the ones considered to be New Cristians are the descendants of Jews forcibly converted to Iberian Catholicism at the end of the XVth century and subjected to conversion practices, extended for three hundred years.\n\n3. An « Allegation » in the Middle of the Road\n\n25 Before settling in Brazil, the couple rambled around the Peninsula, then crossed the desert strip that separates Portugal and Spain. Izabel spent her childhood going back and forth, following the family business. Francisco would go a little later. He was raised at the house of his aunt Izabel Nunes, who would send him to study in Vilar Torpim a subject required for many areas : Latin. His aunt inculcated expectation in this boy, who would become a doctor. The family was « stained » with the New Christian mark, according to coeval vocabulary ; in addition, it was observed that they had a complexion to work in mechanical arts, which delimited the social status. António himself, the « old man », toiled the life in the Almeida village as a farmer and tanner.\n\n28 The « Allegation » against the Bernal Nunes de Miranda was written and published at the end of the jurisconsult’s life, already 50 years old, since the facts ended in 1690. More editions would run, such as the one in 1738. Pegas sought to ground the legal-ideological-theological assessment of the case using an extensive body of auctoritas, commissioned by the mother of the deceased Manuel Dantas da Cunha. He was a knight of the Order of Christ, field master and inquisitorial family member in Almeida. Noble and wealthy, the so-called « Cunha » emerged from a strong military tradition, from people in the governance and who approached the Holy Office.\n\n30 The background of the plot touches on multiple aspects. First, one can become aware of the occupation of Cunha and his brother as masters of the contracts of dry, wet and sealed ports, causing « envy » in Nunes de Miranda. Because of the lineage, the field master impeded the access of enemies in the elections for « honorable positions in the Republic and offices of governance, as well because they were New Christians, and were prohibited by law, besides working as mechanical officers of tanners ». He impugned, therefore, the request made by Nunes de Miranda to the ombudsman of the county of Pinhel for the election for functions in the Chamber.\n\n33At last, the relative Manuel da Cunha was responsible for arresting the doctor and for carrying out diligences by the Coimbra Court, which would have increased the already notorious « animosity ». Francisco had presented himself to the Inquisition in 1669. Cunha appealed for the position in 1672, being invested to the post in the following year. Between 1675 and the following six years, the Inquisition suffered a blow by the suspension of their activities, due to the allegations brought to Rome by New Christian partisans. Upon return, the names of the Nunes de Miranda would again be thrown before the Inquisition. The display of the relative Cunha was inflammatory.\n\n37The case, all the same, contributed to the mobility of the Bernal Nunes de Miranda to Castile and, soon enough, to Bahia. Roughly forty individuals went to Ciudad Rodrigo, extending their stay through Alameda, Sobradillo, Vila del Bodón, Fuenteguinaldo and San Felices de los Gallegos, running various services, including medicine, commerce (sugar, iron, textiles), contracts and royal monopolies, mainly in the tobacco industry. However, a new episode shifted the wanderings.\n\n39Detained, the suspects assessed the risk of arrest of other relatives, who noticed the signs. The execution of Simão Nunes – previously accused of mortally wounding an Inquisitorial relative – demonstrated that Secular Justice also sentenced to the maximum penalty. The said theft is all that is known of this case, with nothing referring to the origin or the grounds on which the accusation was made. One question outshines all others: were the accusations derived from the episode in Vilar Torpim, or were the indictments collateral effects of the publication of the jurisconsult’s book ? Up to this point, the covered sources do not allow an answer.\n\n4. In the Land of All Saints\n\n41 Crossing through the lots of Mogadouro, a municipality in the north of Portugal, in the province of Trás-os-Montes, the family made their way to the city of Porto and embarked for the New World. In a multiplicity of factors, the migration of converts and Old Christians to the colony was due, in part, to the somewhat risky opportunity of economic uplift, for by the turn of the century the colonial ore was already shining in the kingdom, but it was also due to the displacement of the judges of faith.\n\n46 The search for adjustment in the land was also conflictive. In no time the strange looks put the family under inquisitorial waters. In 1703, a certain silversmith presented himself to the commissioner Gaspar Marques Vieira. Thirty years old, he was from Lisbon, patented as an « Old Christian, by the grace of God ». He would complain about « Doctor Francisco Nunes de Miranda, physician and trader in this city, and his family of wife, daughters and sons », as well as his widow Ana and her four children.\n\n47 The whistle-blower amended the mistakes of others : consumption of meat on forbidden days, Sabbath-keeping in detriment of Sunday-keeping, absence from Mass. Inquired as to why he knew this, the silversmith from Lisbon said he had contracted great friendship and trust with the physician, being a neighbor and a guest at dinner. If they ate meat prohibited in the Law of Moses, it was to make it known that they did so, yet the whistle-blower did not fall for the story. « If he was a New Christian he was drawn to his customs and if [he was] an Old Christian [he was inclined] to act in bad way under the observance of God’s Law ». When asked what concept he then formed, he assured :\n\n46 Condition of enslaved people recently (and forcibly) converted to Christianity.\n\n47 ANTT : TSO/IL, Caderno do Promotor, N. 75, liv. 269, fl. 116v.\n\nThey lived by the Law of Moses, and as such, having some deflexion, in no occasion were they seen violating it, even as dangerous and sudden ailments befell the sons and daughter – who were especially ill and distrustful of life - they never invoked the holy name of Jesus as do all faithful Christians ; [sentencing that even] the black gentiles that make up this land in their afflictions, still being brutish and somewhat ladino , invoke the name of God, our Lord, Jesus .\n\n48Seemingly no new evidence was gathered for the allegation. The silversmith claimed to retain his friendship with the family, however, said he had withdrawn from the deal.\n\n52 For a decade, the family group enjoyed life without inquisitorial disturbances. The main space of sociability was the interior of the households. For New Christians, the houses constituted a privileged retreat in cultural intimacy. They served as a stream, shelter and aid to the people in the network of relationships: inside them, people come and go, find rest and nourishment, heal wounds, share fears, comment on everyday events, recount the lengthy crossings of the Caminho do Sertão and of the distant sea voyages.\n\n59 Deviations, silences and details constitute privileged elements. An interesting fact in the case of the book belonging to Ana is the information provided to the inquisitors about its use. Of which, she then asserted :\n\n63 ANTT : TSO/IL Proc. 2424, fl. 62v.\n\nThat those who knew how to read prayed the Psalms and, in fact, had a book which contained the Psalms of David in Castilian. Said book remained in her home when she went away to this kingdom with her so-called sister-in-law and her husband, the so-called João Gomes, to be found inside a trunk in the same house, for she, confidant, not knowing how to read Castilian, did not use the such book .\n\n61 The crypto-Jewish traits varied over time and diversified according to the spatialities. There was a religious attitude grounded on the work of women, based on ceremonial organization, on purification rituals of living or dead bodies, of clothes, of food and meals, of residences, etc. Women were the ones responsible for the material and spiritual preparation for keeping the Sabbath, which they held as a holy day, to the detriment of Sunday. In the case of Ana Bernal, her husband spent seasons sailing to Angola, Costa da Mina and São Tomé, besides cultivating commercial interests with the Brazilian squares of Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco and Cuiabá.\n\n63 Gaspar was often welcomed into the house. He was a cousin of Joseph da Costa and nephew, godson and later son-in-law of Gaspar Lopes da Costa, for whom he was a salesman to Brazil since he was a kiddo. Gaspar was also welcomed by Maria de Miranda, while getting ready to go to Minas Gerais. Occasionally, more individuals would be sheltered. The unraveling of threads reveals one face of this relational network. Alongside him, at Maria’s house, was the merchant António Cardoso Porto, a « Jew » coming from Saint-Esprit-lès-Bayonne, France. Locally, the fellow sought refuge from the clutches of the would-be father-in-law, a nearby resident.\n\n5. Penitent People\n\n67In 1726, in East Lisbon, the Court prosecutors of The Holy Office saw in the distant Brazilian land a religious « infection » that worried the high dome of the Holy Inquisition. In an internal document, prosecutors argued with the General Council about the widespread Jewish crime in Bahia, calling it « a city infected with much Judaism ». It recommended the arrest of an Iberian New Christian family resident in the city, namely Ana Bernal de Miranda, Joseph da Costa, Beatriz Pereira. One should\n\n71 ANTT : TSO/IL Decretos de Prisão, Caderno 4°, fl. 540v.\n\nBear in mind that almost all of them are from the same land and that with the confessions of some, proof to the others will grow, only the more so when being decreed by this Inquisitorial Court, other people from the same land. To which one must add that Bahia is a city, as is presumed, infected with much Judaism ; and that from the need to remedy this damage, it seems that no greater proof should be expected .\n\n69 In the arrest warrant prevailed the factors of evidence, plus further arrests and the heretical infection. The central « testimony » that grounded the warrants was offered by the convert João Gomes, arrested in the Lisbon Inquisition in July 1725, months after arriving from England with his wife, Luísa Maria Rosa. He quoted Ana on February 5, 1726. While Beatriz Pereira relied on the statement of a New Christian from Porto, cousin of João Gomes, from her time living in Portugal. The first ground for arresting them was the family connection, considered as the basis of Jewish heresy, as the transgressor of the order. The Inquisition sought to form a circuit of plea bargains in order to, therefore, expand it to other individuals. The second ground for arrest was the common space. The Inquisitorial ministers presumed that the captaincy was « infected » with the law of Moses.\n\n6. Final Consideration\n\n76This paper, thus, faced the challenge proposed by Arlette Farge :\n\n81 A. Farge, Lugares para la historia, Santiago, Ediciones Universidad Diego Portales, 2008, p. 23.\n\nTo enter through these words into one of the living abodes of history, there, where words form fractures in a particular social or imaginary space. The speeches of suffering and complaint mark a border place where we see society regulating, facing, well or poorly, what comes upon it; the fracture formed by that pain is also a social bond, and the individuals manage it in multiple ways .\n\n77 The Bernal Nunes de Miranda were a family branch – among countless New Christian families of modernity – which had the bitter experience of subjugation by the courts of faith, and their existence marked by prejudices grounded on civil and religious rights. And they, by all accounts, tried to play the game.\n\n79 In addition to the captain’s case, they continued to live, not for lack of options, in Catholic lands. Perhaps some divided between two worlds, in circularity of cultures, in all devout feelings that the Portuguese court of Misericordia et Justitia (1536-1821) sought to oppose, still in the distant XVIIIth century, in the name of religious intolerance ; euphemistically called the expansion and conservation of Christianity. In this case, an intolerance secularly nurtured by the New Christian ethnic stigma."
