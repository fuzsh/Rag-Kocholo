        "text": "CHAP. I.\n\nBriefe Collections of Voyages, chiefly of Spaniards and Portugals, [ 30] taken out of ANTONIE GALVANOS Booke of the Discoueries of the World.\n\nIN the yeere 1153. in the time of Fredericke Barbarossa it is written, that there came to Lubec, a Citie of Germanie, one Canoa with certaine Indians, like vnto a long Barge: which seemed to haue come from the coast of Baccalaos, which stan∣deth in the same latitude that Germanie doth: The Germaines greatly wondered to see such a Barge, and such People, not [ 40] knowing from whence they came, nor vnderstanding their speech, especially because there was then no knowledge of that Countrie, as now there is: it may be credible that though the Boate was small in respect of those huge Seas, yet the Winde and Water might bring them thither: as wee see in these our dayes, that the Almadie which is but a small Boate, commeth notwithstanding from Quiloa, Mosambique, and Sofala, to the Iland of Saint Helena, being a small spot of Land standing in the mayne Ocean off the coast of Bona Sperança so farre separated. [ 50]\n\nIn the yeere 1300. after the comming of Christ, the great Soldan of Cairo commanded, that the Spiceries and Drugs, and merchandises of India should be carried through the Red Sea, as it was vsed before: at which time they vnladed on the Arabian side, at the Hauen of Iuda, and car∣ried them vnto the house at Mecca, and the Carriers of it were the Pilgrims. So that each Prince vsed a custome to augment the honour, and increase the profite of his countrie. And these Sol∣dans had speciall regard to Cairo, from whence the wares were carried vnto the Countries of E∣gypt, Lybia, Africa, the Kingdomes of Tunez, Tremessen, Fez, Marocco, Suz: and some of it was carried beyond the Mountaines of Atlas vnto the Citie of Tombuto, and the Kingdome of the Ial••phos; vntill afterwards that the Portugals did bring it about the Cape of Bona Sperança vnto the Citie of Lisbone, as in the place conuenient we purpose to shew more at large. [ 60]\n\nIn the yeere 1344. King Peter the fourth of that name reigning in Arragon, the Chronicles of his time report, that one Don Luis of Cerda, sonne vnto the sonne of Don Iohn of Cerda, craued aide of him to goe and to conquere the Iles of the Canaries, standing in 28. degrees of latitude to the North, because they were giuen vnto him by Pope Clement the sixt, which was a French man.\n\nWhereby in those dayes there grew a knowledge of those Ilands in all Europe, and specially in Spaine: for such great Princes would not begin nor enterprise things of such moment without great certaintie.\n\nAbout this time also the Iland of Madera was discouered by an English man, called Macham: who sailing out of England into Spaine, with a woman of his, was driuen out of his direct course by a tempest, and arriued in that Iland, and cast his anker in that Hauen, which now is called Ma∣chico, after the name of Macham. And because his Louer was then Sea-sicke, hee there went on Land withsome of his companie, and in the meane time his ship weyed and put to Sea, leauing him there: whereupon his Louer for thought died. Macham, which greatly loued her, built in the Iland a Chappell or Hermitage to burie her in, calling it by the name of Iesus Chappell: and wrote or graued vpon the stone of her Tombe his name and hers, and the occasion whereupon [ 10] they arriued there. After this hee made himselfe a Boate all of a Tree, the trees being there of a great compasse about, and went to Sea in it with those men of his companie that were left with him, and fell with the coast of Africke without Saile or Oare, and the Moores among whom hee came tooke it for a miracle, and presented him vnto the King of that countrie: and that King al∣so admiring the accident, sent him and his companie vnto the King of Castile.\n\nIn the yeere 1395. King Henrie the third of that name reigning in Castile, the information which Macham gaue of this Iland, and also the ship wherein hee went thither, mooued many of France and of Castile to goe and discouer it, and the great Canarie: And they which went were principally the Andaluzes, the Biscaines, and the Guepuseoes, carrying with them many people and horses. But I know not whether the charge of that voyage was theirs or the Kings. But by [ 20] whomsoeuer it was set out, they seeme to bee the first that discouered the Canaries, and landed in them: where also they tooke one hundred and fiftie of the Ilanders prisoners. Concerning the time of this discouerie, there is some difference among the Writers: for some affirme this to bee done in the yeere 1405.\n\nTHe Chronicles of Portugall haue this record, That after the Incarnation of Christ 1415. King Iohn the first of that name King of Portugall, departed from the Citie of Lisbone with the Prince Don Duarte or Edward, and Don Peter, and Don Henrie his sonnes, with other Lords, and Nobles of his Realme, and sailed into Africa, where he tooke the great Citie of Ceuta, stan∣ding on the North side thereof betweene 35. and 36. degrees in latitude: which was one of the [ 30] principall causes of the enlarging of the Dominions of Portugall.\n\nWhen they were come from thence, Henrie, the Kings third sonne, desirous to enlarge the Kingdome, and to discouer strange and vnknowne Countries, being then in Algarbe, gaue dire∣ction for the discouerie of the coast of Mauritania. For in those dayes none of the Portugals had euer passed the Cape de Non, standing in 29. degrees of latitude. And for the better accomplish∣ing of this discouerie, the aforesaid Don Henrie prepared a fleete, and gaue commandement to the chiefe Captaines to proceede in discouerie from the aforesaid Cape forward: Which they did. But when they came to another Cape named Boiador, there was not one of them that durst goe farther or beyond it: at which fearfull and cowardly faintnesse of theirs, the Prince was excee∣dingly displeased. [ 40]\n\nIn the yeere 1417. King Iohn the second reigning in Castile, and his mother Lady Katharine then vsing the gouernment, one Monsieur Ruben of Bracamonte, which was then Admirall of France, craued the conquest of the Ilands of the Canaries, with the title to be King of them, for a kinsman of his, called Monsieur Iohn Betancourt: which being granted him by the Queene, and farther also partly furnished out, he departed from Siuil with a good armie: But the chiefe or principall cause that moued him to enter into this action, was to discouer and perfectly to take a view of the Iland of Madera, whereof Macham before had giuen so much information. But for all that he went vnto the Canaries, and carried with him a Friar, called Mendo, to bee as Bishop thereof, admitted by Pope Martin the fift. When they were landed, they wonne Lancerota, For∣teuentura, Gomera, and Ferro: from whence they sent into Spaine many Slaues, Hony, Waxe, [ 50] Comfora or Camfire, Hides, Orchall, Figs, Sanguis Draconis, and other merchandises, whereof they made good profit: And this Armie also, as they report, discouered Porto Santo. The Iland that they inhabited was Lancerota, where they built in it a Castle of stone for their better defence and securitie.\n\nIn the yeere 1418. one Iohn Gonzales Zarco, and Tristam Vaz Teixera, houshold Gentlemen vnto Don Henrie the Kings third sonne, perceiuing the desire that their Master had to discouer new Countries, and willing in that course to doe him some seruice, craued of him a Barke, and licence to vndertake the action: which they obtayned, and sailed to the coast of Africa: where they were ouertaken with a terrible tempest; but they were succoured by falling with the Land, and entring into an Hauen called Santo, where they landed, and remayned two yeeres. [ 60]\n\nIn the yeere 1420. they discouered the Iland of Madera, where they found the Chappell and the Stone and Tombe, whereupon the foresaid Macham had grauen his name. There are others that write, that a certaine Castillian, perceiuing the desire and fauour to Nauigation, which Don\n\nHenrie had, told him that they had found the Iland of Porto Santo; which being but a small thing they made no reckoning of it. Don Henrie sent Bartholomew Perestrelle, Iohn Conzales Zarco, Tristam Vaz Teixera, and by the signes and likelihoods that they had receiued, they went to Porto Santo, and there remayned two yeeres: and after that, namely, in the yeere 1420. they sailed also to the Iland of Madera, where they found the memoriall and moniment of the afore∣said Macham the English man.\n\nAs for Monsieur Betancourt, who entred into the Conquest of the Canaries, as is aboue men∣tioned, he was slaine in the middest of the action, and left behinde him for his heire a kinsman of his, called Monsieur Menante, who after that sold the said Ilands of the Cauaries vnto one Peter Barba of Siuil. There are other which speake otherwise, and say, that Monsieur Iohn Betancourt went into France to prepare a new Armie about this Conquest, and left there a Nephew of his; [ 10] who because he heard no more of his Vncle, and saw that hee could not maintaine the warres any longer, he sold the Canaries to Don Henrie the King of Portugals third sonne, for a certaine thing that he gaue him in the Iland of Madera.\n\nIn the yeere 1424. they write that the said Don Henrie prepared a Nauie and Armie to con∣quer these Ilands, wherein there went as Captaine Generall, one Don Fernando de Castro; and by reason of the valiantnesse and warlike behauiour of the people, they had the repulse: whereupon Don Ferdinando, considering the great charge, and little or no good successe, hee gaue ouer the a∣ction, and returned back againe. After this Don Henrie resigned ouer these Ilands to the Crowne of Castile, in consideration of the aides which Betancourt had receiued. But the Castallians agree not vnto this report. For they say, that neither the Kings of Portugall, nor Don Henrie would ren∣der [ 20] the Ilands, till they came in question before Pope Eugenius the fourth; who fully vnderstan∣ding the matter, gaue the Conquest of the Ilands by order of iudgement vnto the King of Castile in the yeere 1431. whereupon this contention ceased touching the Title of the Canaries, betweene the Kings of Portugall and of Castile.\n\nThese Ilands being in number seuen, were called by the name of Fortunatae, standing in 28. de∣grees to the North: where the longest day is but thirteene houres, and the longest night as much, lying distant from Spaine two hundred leagues, and from the Coast of Africa eighteene leagues. The people were Idolaters, and did eate their flesh raw for want of firè: they had no Iron, and Towed without any toole: they tilled and raised the ground with Oxe hornes, and Goats hornes. [ 30]\n\nEuery Iland did speake a seuerall language. They tooke many wiues, and knew them not car∣nally vntill they had deliuered them to the Superiours. They had diuers other Paganish customs: but now the Christian faith is planted among them. The commodities of these Ilands are Wheat, Barly, Sugar, Wine, and certaine birds, called Canarie birds, much esteemed in Spaine and other places.\n\nIn the Iland of Ferro they haue none other water, but that which proceedeth in the night from a Tree, compassed with a cloud, whence water issueth, seruing the whole Iland both Men and Cattell, a thing notorious and knowne to very many.\n\nIn the yeere 1428. it is written that Don Peter, the King of Portugals eldest sonne, was a great traueller. He went into England, France, Almaine, and from thence into the Holy Land, and to [ 40] other places; and came home by Italie, taking Rome and Venice in his way: from whence hee brought a Map of the World, which had all the parts of the World and Earth described. The Streight of Magelan was called in it, The Dragons taile: The Cape of Bona Sperança, The fore∣front of Afrike, and so forth of other places: by which Map, Don Henrie the Kings third sonne, was much helped and furthered in his Discoueries.\n\nIt was told mee by Francis de Sosa Tauares, that in the yeere 1528. Don Fernando the Kings sonne and heire did shew him a Map, which was found in the studie of Alcobaza, which had beene made one hundred and twentie yeeres before, which Map did set forth all the Nauigation of the East Indies, with the Cape of Bona Sperança, according as our later Maps haue described it. Whereby it appeareth, that in ancient time there was as much or more discouered, then now [ 50] there is. Notwithstanding all the trauaile, paines, and expences in this action of Don Henrie, yet he was neuer wearie of his purposed Discoueries. At length, there was a seruant of his, called Gilianes, that first passed the Cape Boiador, a place before terrible to all men: and hee brought word that it was not so dangerous, as it was reported: for on the other side of it he went on land, and in manner of taking possession, set in the ground a Crosse of wood, to bee as a marke and to∣ken afterwards of his discouerie so farre. In the yeere 1433. in the moneth of August, Don Iohn died, and his sonne Don Duarte or Edward succeeded him in his Kingdome.\n\nIn the yeere 1434. Don Henrie set out one Alfonso Gonsales Baldaia, and Gilianes aforesaid, and they went to another Cape, which was beyond the former, and going on land perceiued the Countrie to be inhabited: and because they were desirous to satisfie Don Henrie, with as much [ 60] relation and knowledge as they could get, they continued their voyage, and went forward, till they came to a certaine point of Land, from whence they turned backe againe. In the yeere 1438. King Edward, whom the Portugals call Don Duarte, died, and Don Alphonso the Prince being yong, Don Peter his Vncle, gouerned the Kingdome.\n\nIn the yeere 1441. Don Henrie sent out two ships, and the Captaines were in the one Tristan, and Antonie Gonsales in the other. Being put to Sea they tooke a prize vpon the Coast; and sai∣led on to Cape Blanco, that is, the White Cape, standing in 20. degrees, and informed Don Henrie of the state of that Conntrie by the Moores, which they brought from thence. Whereupon hee sent one Fernan Lopez de Sauado, to giue knowledge thereof to Pope Martin, trusting to make these things commodious to Holy Church. Vpon which knowledge the Pope granted Indul∣gences and euerlasting pardon, and all other things demanded of him, vnto those which should die in this enterprise. After this, in the yeere 1443. Don Henrie commanded Antonie Gonsales to carry backe the slaues which he had brought, and to ransome them in their Countrie: Which he did, and the Moores gaue them in trucke for them againe blacke Moores with curled haire, [ 10] and some gold; so that now that place is called Rio de Oro, that is, the Golden Riuer; whereby the desire of the Discouerie might be the more increased.\n\nNot long after he sent out another, named Nunnez Tristan, who came vnto the Ilands of Ar∣guin, where he tooke more slaues, and brought them to Portugall in the yeere 1444. Hereupon also one Lansarote, a Groome of Don Gilians chamber, with others associated with him, armed out certaine ships, which went coasting till they came to the Ilands of Garze, where they tooke two hundred slaues: which were the first that were brought from thence to Portugall.\n\nIn the yeere 1445. there went as Captaine of a Barke one Gonsalo de Syntra, an Esquire belong∣ing to Don Henrie into those parts; and he went on Land, where he was taken with sixe or seuen more of his companie, which place was therefore called after his name, Angra de Gonsaluo de [ 20] Syntra. This was the first losse, which the Portugals receiued in their Discoueries.\n\nIn the yeere following, Don Henrie sent out three Carauels, wherein went as Captaines An∣tonie Gonsales, Diego Aloizio, and Gomes Perez, who had their direction, not to enter into Rio de Oro, nor to beare themselues disorderly, but to trauaile in peace, and to conuert as many Infidels as they could to Christianitie. But none of these things were performed by them; for they re∣turned without doing any memorable act. In the same yeere 1446. another Esquire belonging to the King of Portugall, called Denis Fernandes, of the Citie of Lubone, entred into these Disco∣ueries, more to win fame then to reape commoditie by them. And he being in his voyage came to the Riuer of Sanaga, standing betweene 15. and 16. degrees of latitude towards the North, where he tooke certaine Negroes; and not contented therewith, hee went forward and discoue∣red [ 30] Cap•• Verde, standing in 14. degrees on the same side; and there hee set vp vpon the Land a Crosse of wood, and then returned with great contentation.\n\nIn the yeere 1447. one Nunnez Tristan went forth to discouer in a Carauell, and he passed the aforesaid Cape Verde, and Rio Grande, and went past it vnto another, standing beyond it in 12. degrees, where he was also taken with eighteene Portugals more: but the ship came home againe in safetie, conducted by foure or fiue which escaped the hands of the Negroes.\n\nIn this yeere also 1447. it hapned that there came a Portugall ship through the Streight of Gi∣braltar; and being taken with a great tempest, was forced to run Westwards more then willingly the men would, and at last they fell vpon an Iland which had seuen Cities, and the people spake the Portugall tongue, and they demanded if the Moores did yet trouble Spaine, whence they had [ 40] fled for the losse which they receiued by the death of the King of Spaine, Don Roderigo. The Boatswaine of the ship brought home a little of the Sand, and sold it vnto a Gold-smith of Lisbon, out of the which hee had a good quantitie of gold. Don Pedro vnderstanding this, being then Gouernour of the Realme, caused all the things thus brought home, and made knowne, to be re∣corded in the house of Iustice. There be some that thinke, that those Ilands whereunto the Por∣tugals were thus driuen, were the Antiles, or New Spaine, alleaging good reasons for their opi∣nion, which here I omit, because they serue not to my purpose. But all their reasons seeme to a∣gree, that they should be that Countrie, which is called Noua Spagna.\n\nIn the yeere 1449. the King Don Alfonso gaue licence vnto his Vncle Don Henrie, to inhabit the Ilands of the Açores, which were long before discouered. And in the yeere 1458. this King [ 50] went into Africa, and there hee tooke the Towne, called Alcaçer. And in the yeere 1461. hee commanded Signior Mendez, a Gentleman of his House, to build the Castle of Arguin, where∣of he gaue vnto him the gouernment, as to his Lieutenant.\n\nIn the yeere 1462. there came into the Realme of Portugall three Genowais of good paren∣tage, the chiefe of whom vvas called Antonie de Noli, and of the other two, the one was his brother, the other was his nephew, and each of these had his seuerall ship, crauing libertie of Don Henrie to discouer the Ilands of Cape Verde, which was granted them. Others say, that the places which they discouered, were those vvhich Antiquitie called the Gorgades, Hespe∣rides, and Dorcades: but they named them Mayo, Saint Iago, and Saint Philip, because they discouered them on those Saints dayes: but they are also called by some, the Ilands of [ 60] Antonio.\n\nIn the yeere following 1463. this good noble man Don Henrie died, leauing from Cape De Non, discouered vnto the mountaine called Sierra Leona, standing on this side the Line in eight degrees of latitude, where no man had beene before that time.\n\nIn the yeere 1469. the King of Portugall did let out for yeerely Rent the trade of Guiney vn∣to one called Fernan Gomez, which Countrie afterwards was called The Mine. He let it out for fiue yeeres, for two hundred thousand Reyes by the yeere (which is of our English money, one hundred thirty eight pounds seuenteene shillings nine pence halfpeny) and added vnto his lease this condition, that euery yeere he should discouer an hundred leagues. In the yeere follow∣ing, which was 1470. this King went into Africa, with his sonne Prince Iohn, where they tooke the Towne of Arzila, and the people of the Citie of Tanger fled out for feare, and that he took also. It seemeth that good fortune followeth a couragious attempt.\n\nIn the yeere 1471. Fernan Gomes gaue commandement that the Coast should be discouered as it lay. Which was vndertaken by Iohn de S. Aren, and Iohn de Scouar; and they went and [ 10] found the Mine in 5. degrees of latitude. And the next yeere, which was 1472 one Fernando de Poo discouered the Iland now called after his name. Also about this time the Ilands of Saint Thomas, and Del Principe were discouered, standing vnder the Line, with the firme Land also, wherein is the Kingdome of Benin, reaching to the Cape De Santa Katarina, stan∣ding on the South side of the Line in 3. degrees. The man that made this Discouerie was a seruant of the Kings, and his name was Sequeira. Many suppose, that then also there were those places, Countries and Ilands discouered, which before were neuer knowne to vs since the Floud.\n\nIn the yeere 1480. the valiant King Don Alfonso died, and left many things worthie of me∣morie behind him; and his sonne Don Iohn the Second succeeded him. Who in the yeere 1481. [ 20] gaue direction for the building of the Castle De Mina to one Diego d'Azambuxa; who did so, and was made Captaine of it.\n\nIn the yeere 1484. the foresaid King Iohn sent out one Diego Caon a Knight of his Court to discouer: and he went to the Riuer of Conge, standing on the South side in 7. or 8. de∣grees of latitude; where he erected a Pillar of stone with the Royall Armes and Letters of Portugall, wherein he wrote the commandement that he had receiued from the King, with the time and day of his being there. From thence he went vnto a Riuer neere the Tropike of Ca∣pricorne, setting still vp Pillars of stone where he thought it conuenient, and so came backe a∣gaine vnto Congo, and to the King of that Countrie: who thereupon sent an Ambassador and men of credit into Portugall. [ 30]\n\nIn the next yeere or the second following, one Iohn Alonso d'Aneiro came from the King∣dome of Benin, and brought home Pepper with a taile: which was the first of that kind seeue in Portugall.\n\nIn the yeere 1487. King Iohn sent to discouer India ouer Land. In which Iourney went one Pedro de Couillan a seruant of the Kings, and Alfonso de Payua, because they could speake the Arabian tongue. They went out in the moneth of May, and the same yeere they tooke shipping at Naples, and arriued in the Ile of Rhodes, and lodged in the house that was prouided for the Portugall Knights of that order: from thence they went to Alexandria, and so to Cairo, and thence to the Hauen of Toro in the companie of the Carauans or Carriers which were Moores. There they tooke shipping, and being on the Red Sea they arriued at the Ci∣tie [ 40] of Aden, and there they separated themselues: for Alfanso de Payua went towards Ae∣thiopia, and Pedro de Couillan into India. Who came into the Cities of Cananor and Calicut, and came backe vnto Goa: where he tooke shipping vnto Sofala, being on the Coast of Africa in the Southerne latitude of 20. degrees, to see the Mines that were of so great name. From Sofala he turned backe to Mosambique, and vnto the Cities of Quiloa, Mombaza, and Me∣linde, till he came backe againe vnto the Citie of Aden: where he and Alfonso de Payua diui∣ded themselues: and thence hee sayled againe through the Red Sea vnto the Citie of Cayro, where he thought to haue met with his companion: but there hee heard that he was dead by the Letters that he receiued from King Iohn his Master; in which Letters he was farther com∣manded to trauell into the Countrie and Dominions of Presbyter Iohn. Vpon this commande∣ment [ 50] he prouided for his farther Iourney, and from Cayro went backe againe to the Hauen of Toro, and from thence to Aden, where hee had beene twice before: and there hearing of the fame of the Citie of Ormuz, he determined to goe thither; and therefore went along the Coast of Arabia vnto the Cape Razalgate standing vnder the Tropike of Cancer, and from thence he went to Ormuz, standing in 27. degrees on that side. There he learned and vnderstood of the Straight of Persia, and of that Countrie: and entred there into the Red Sea, and passed ouer to the Realme of the Abassini, which commonly is called Presbyter Iohns Countrie or Aethiopia: and there he was detained till the yeere 1520. when there came thither the Ambassador Don Roderigo de Lima: This Pedro de Couillan was the first Portugall that euer knew and saw the Indias and those Seas, and other places adjoyning thereunto. [ 60]\n\nIn the yeere 1490. the King sent vnto Congo one Gonzalo de Sosa a Gentleman with three ships, and in them sent home the Ambassador of Congo, which was sent into Portugall, whom Diego Caon had brought from thence: who at his being in Portugall was baptised both himselfe and others of his companie. The aforesaid Gonzalo de Sosa died in that Iourney by\n\nthe way, and in his roome they chose his Nephew Ruy de Sosa for their Captaine; and so be∣ing come vnto Congo, the King was very glad of their comming, and yeelded himselfe, and the greater part of his Realme to be baptized: whereof the Portugals had good cause to re∣ioyce, seeing by them so many Infidels were conuerted from Gentilisme and Paganisme to Christianitie.\n\nIn the yeere 1492. in the time of Don Ferdinando King of Castile, he being at the siege of Granada, dispatched one Christopher Columbus a Genoway with three ships to goe and discouer Noua Spagna: who first had offered his seruice for a Westerne discouerie vnto King Iohn of Portugall; but he would not entertaine him.\n\nHee being sufficiently furnished for this enterprise departed from the Towne of Palos the [ 10] third day of August, hauing with him as Captaines and Pilots Martin Alfonso Pinzon, Francis Martinez Pinzon, Uincent Yannes Pinzon, and Bartholomew Columbus his brother, with an hun∣dred and twenty persons more in his companie: and some affirme that they were the first that sayled by latitudes.\n\nHereupon there grew such a common desire of trauell among the Spaniards, that they were ready to leape into the Sea to swimme, if it had beene possible, into those new-found parts. The aforesaid companie of Columbus, at their comming home, tooke in their way the Iles of the Açores, and the fourth day of March in the yeere 1493. the entred into the barre of Lisbon: which discouerie pleased not the King of Portugall. Whereupon rose a contention betweene those two Kings. [ 20]\n\nChristopher Columbus being arriued, went presently into Castile with the newes of all things, and acquainted the King Fernando with the discontentednesse of the King of Portugall: where∣upon he and the Queene Isabella his wife sent streight word thereof vnto Pope Alexander the Sixt, whereat he and the Italians were in great admiration, maruelling that there was any more Land besides that which was vnder the Romanes. But the end of this matter was this: A∣lexander the Pope gaue these Countries by his Iudgement vnto the Kingdomes of Leon and Castile; with this condition, That they should labour to extirpate Idolatrie, and plant the holy Faith in those Countries.\n\nFernando the King hauing receiued this answere, was glad of it, and sent Christopher Colum∣bus againe on the former Voyage, hauing made him Admirall, and giuen him other honours, [ 30] with particular Armes, and a Pofie written about his Armes to this effect. For Castile and for Leon, A new world found out Colon.\n\nIn the yeere 1493. the fiue and twentieth of the moneth of October Christopher Columbus went back vnto the Antiles, and from Cadiz he tooke his course, hauing in his companie seuen∣teene ships, and fifteene hundred men in them, with his brethren Bartholomew Columbus, and Diego Columbus, with other Knights, Gentlemen, men of Law, and Religious men, with Cha∣lices, Crosses, rich ornaments, and with great power and dignitie from Pope Alexander; and the tenth day after their setting forth, they arriued at the Canaries; and from thence in fiue and twenty or thirty dayes they sayled vnto the Antiles; and the first Iland that they saw standeth in 14. degrees towards the North, due West from Cape Verde on the coast of Africa. They say [ 40] that the distance from thence to the Canaries is eight hundred leagues. The name they gaue it was Deseada, that is, the Desired or wished Iland, for the great desire which the companie had to come to sight of Land. After that they discouered many more which they named the Uir∣gines, which the Naturals of the Countrie call the Caribas, for that the men of that Countrie are good warriers, and shoot well in Bowes. they poison their Arrowes with an herbe, whereof he that is hurt dieth, biting himselfe like as a made Dog doth.\n\nFrom these Ilands and others they went vnto the principall Iland there, which they of the Countrie doe call Boriquen, and the Spaniards call it Saint Iohn, and thence to Hispaniola or Isa∣bella, where they found all the men dead which there they had left. Here the Admirall left the most part of the people to plant it, and appointed his brethren to bee Gouernours there: and [ 50] so tooke two ships, and went to discouer the other side of the Iland of Cuba, and from thence to Iamaica. All these Ilands stand from 16. vnto 20. degrees of Northerly latitude. In the meane time that the Admirall sayled about, his brethren and they that were left with them were much troubled, because the Sauages did rise against them. So that Christopher Colon went backe againe into Spaine, to tell the King and Queene of his aduentures.\n\nIn the yeere 1494. and in the moneth of Ianuary there was an agreement made of the dif∣ferences which were betweene the two Kings of Spaine and Portugall. For the which agree∣ment there were sent out of Portugall Ruy de Sosa, and Don Iohn his sonne, and the Doctor Ayres de Almada: and for the King of Spaine there were Don Henry Henriques, Don Iohn de Cardenas, and the Doctor Maldonado. All these met in the Towne of Tordefillas, and they diui∣ded [ 60] the World from the North to the South by a Meridian which standeth West from the I∣lands of Cape Verde 300. leagues: so that the one halfe which lay to the East should belong vnto Portugall, and that which lay to the West to the King of Spaine, whereby notwithstanding liber∣tie to trauell was left equall vnto both. In the yeere following 1495. Iohn King of Portugall died, and Emmanuel his Cousin began to raigne.\n\nIn the yeere 1496. there was a Uenetian in England, called Iohn Cabota, who hauing know∣ledge of such a new Discouerie as this was, and perceiuing by the Globe, that the Ilands before spoken of stood almost in the same Latitude with his Countrey, and much neerer to England then to Portugall, or to Castile, hee acquainted King Henrie the seuenth then King of England with the same, wherewith the said King was greatly pleased, and furnished him out with two Ships and three hundred men: which departed and set sayle in the Spring of the yeere, and they sayled Westward till they came in sight of land in 45. degrees of Latitude towards the North, and then went straight Northwards till they came into 60. degrees of Latitude, where the day is eighteene houres long, and the night is very cleere and bright. There they found the ayre cold, and great Ilands of ice, but no ground in an hundred fathoms sounding: and so from thence finding the land to turne Eastwards, they trended along by it discouering all the Bay [ 10] and Riuer named Descada, to see if it passed on the other side: Then they sayled backe a∣gaine till they came to 38. degrees toward the Equinoctiall line, and from thence returned into England. There be others which say, that hee went as farre as the Cape of Florida, which stan∣deth in 25. degrees.\n\nIn the yeere 1497. the King of Spaine Don Fernando sent out Christopher Columbus with sixe ships, and hee himselfe prouided two ships at his owne cost, and sending his brother before, he made sayle from the Bay of Cadiz, carrying with him his Son Don Diego Colon. It was then re∣ported that he went to take the Iland of Madera, because he mistrusted the French-men, & ther∣fore sent thither three ships: others say it was to the Canaries. But howsoeuer it was, this is [ 20] true, that he and three more went vnto the Ilands of Cape Uerde, and ranne along by the line finding great calmes and raine, and the first land which they came vnto of the Antiles was an I∣land standing in 9. degrees of Latitude towards the North joyning fast vnto the maine land, which they called La Trinidada; and so he entred into the Gulfe of Paria, and came out of the mouth which they name Bocca de Dragone, or the Dragons mouth: and they tooke their course hard by the Coast, where they found three small Ilands, which they named Los Testigos, that is to say, The Witnesses, beyond which standeth the Iland of Cubagua, where is great fishing of muscle Pearles: where also, as they say, there springeth a Well of oyle: and beyond that Iland they came to the Iles of Frailes, Roques, Aruba, and Curacao, with other small ones all along the Bay: and they came to the point of Cabo de Uela, and discouered along the Coast almost [ 30] two hundred leagues, from whence they crossed ouer to Hispaniola, hauing had also sight of the Iland called Beata.\n\nIn this same yeere 1497. on the twentieth day of the moneth of Iune, one Vasques de Gama, sayled from Lisbon by the King Emmanuels commandement to India with three ships, wherein there went for Captaines Uasques de Gama, Paulus de Gama his brother, and Nicolas Coello with one hundred and twentie men; with whom also there went one ship laden onely with victuals, and in fourteene dayes they came vnto Cape Verde, vnto the Iland of Saint Iago, where they re∣freshed themselues, and from thence they went along the coast beyond the Cape of Bona Spe∣ranza, whereupon they erected certayne Pillers of stone, and so came vnto Mosambique, stan∣ding in 15. degrees to the South of the line, where they stayed not long, but went from thence to Mombaza, and vnto Melinde: where the King of that place gaue them Pilots, which con∣ducted [ 40] them into India, in which discouerie they found out Los Baxos do Padua, that is to say; the flats of Padua.\n\nIn the yeere 1498. in the moneth of May, they came to an anker before the Citie of Calicut, and Panana, where they remained all the winter: and the first day of September they set sayle towards the North, discouering the Coast all along till they came to the Iland of Angediua, which standeth on that side in in 15. degrees of latitude, where they came to an anker in the be∣ginning of October, and so they departed from Angediua in Februarie, in the yeere 1499. and came in sight of the coast of Africa about Melinde towards the North 3. or 4. degrees, and from thence they sayled vnto the said Citie, and so vnto Mosambique againe, and to the Cape of Bo∣na [ 50] Speranza, sayling along by the Coast, and then they came to the Ilands of Cape Verde, and last of all to the Citie of Lisbon in the moneth of September, hauing beene in the voyage six and twentie moneths.\n\nIn the yeere 1499. on the thirteenth day of the moneth of Nouember, there departed from Pales one Uincent Yannez Pinson and his nephew Aries Pinson, with foure ships well appointed at their owne cost and charges, to discouer the new world vnder the licence of the King of Ca∣stile, and with commandement not to touch there, where the Admirall Columbus had beene. And so they went to the Ilands of Cape Verde, and passed the line to the Southward, and dis∣couered the Cape of Saint Augustine, standing on that side in 8. degrees of latitude, and there they wrote on the rindes of Pine trees the names of the King and Queene, also the yeere and [ 60] day when they arriued there. They fought with the people of Brasil, but got nothing, they tooke their course all along the coast towards the West vnto the Riuer Maria Tambal, and at that time they had taken thirtie and odde Prisoners. The chiefe places where they touched were the Cape of S. Augustine, and the angle or point of S. Luke, and Tierra de los Humos, the\n\nRiuers of Marannon, and of the Amazones, and Rio dolce, or the Sweet Riuer, and other places along the Coast: and they came to 10. degrees of latitude on the North side, where they lost two ships and their companie, and remained in that Voyage of discouerie ten moneths and fifteene dayes.\n\nIn the yeere 1500. and in the moneth of March, one Pedro Aluarez Cabral sayled out of Lis∣bon with thirteene ships, with commandement not to come neere the coast of Africa to shorten his way; and he losing the sight of one of his ships, went to seeke her, and in seeking of her lost his course, and sayled till he came within sight of the land. The Generall was so long in see∣king his ship, that the companie were wearie of it, and entreated him to leaue his enterprise. The next day they fell in sight of the Coast of Brasil: whereupon the Generall commanded a Barke to goe to land and seeke a hauen: which they did, and found a good and safe hauen, and [ 10] they named it Puerto Seguro, that is to say, The safe Hauen, standing on the South side in 17. de∣grees of latitude. From thence they sayled towards the Cape of Bona Speranca, and Melinde, and crossed ouer to the Riuer of Cochin, which before was not knowne, where they laded them∣selues with Pepper, and at their returne Sancho de Thouar discouered the Citie of Sofala vpon the coast of Africa.\n\nIn this same yeere 1500. it is reported that Gaspar Cortereal craued a generall licence of the King Emmanuel to discouer the New found land. Hee went from the Iland Tercera with two ships well appointed at his owne cost, and hee sayled vnto that climate which standeth vnder the North in 50. degrees of latitude, which is a land now called after his name; and hee came home in safetie vnto the Citie of Lisbon: And making another time this voyage, the ship was [ 20] lost wherein he went, and the other came backe into Portugall. Wherefore his brother Michael Cortereal went to seeke him with three ships well appointod at his owne cost; and when they came vnto that Coast, and found so many entrances of Riuers and Hauens, euery ship went into her seuerall Riuer, with this rule and order, that they all three should meet againe the twentieth day of August. The two other ships did so, and they seeing that Michael Cortereal was not come at the day appointed, nor yet afterwards in a certaine time, returned backe into the realme of Portugall, and ueuer heard any more newes of him, nor yet any other memorie. But that Countrey is called, The land of Cortereall vnto this day.\n\nIn this yeere 1501. in the moneth of March, Iohn de Noua departed from the Citie of Lisbon with foure ships, and passed the line on the South side into 8. degrees of latitude, and he disco∣uered [ 30] an Iland, which he called the Ile de Ascension: and hee went vnto Mosambique, and to Melinde, and from thence he crossed ouer vnto the other side, where they tooke lading, and so came backe and doubled the Cape, and found an Iland called Santa Helena, being but a small thing, but yet of great importance in respect of the situation thereof.\n\nIn this same yeere 1501. and in the moneth of May, there departed out of Lisbon, three ships vpon the commandement of Emmanuel the King to discouer the coast of Brasil: and they sayled in the sight of the Canaries, and from thence to Cape Verde, where they refreshed themselues in the Towne of Bezequiche, and passed from thence beyond the line Southward, and fell with the land of Brasill in 5. degrees of latitude, and so went forward till they came in 32. degrees little more or lesse, according as they accounted it, and from thence they came backe in the moneth [ 40] of Aprill, because it was there at that time cold and tempestuous. They were in that voyage fif∣teene moneths, and came to Lisbon againe in the beginning of September, 1502.\n\nIn the yeere 1502. one Alfonso Hoteda went to discouer Terra firma, and followed his course till he came to the Prouince of Vraba.\n\nThe next yeere following, also one Roderigo Bastidas of Siuill went out with two Carauels at his owne cost, and the first land of the Antiles that hee saw was an Iland which he named Isla Verde, that is, the Greene Iland, standing fast by the Iland of Guadalupe, towards the land: and from thence they tooke their course towards the West to Santa Martha, and Cape De la Vela, and to Rio Grande, or the Great riuer, and they discouered the Hauen of Zamba, the Coradas, Carthagena, and the Ilands of Saint Barnard, of Baru, and Isla•• de Arenas, and went forward [ 50] vnto Isla fuerte, and to the point of Caribana, standing at the end of the Gulfe of Vraba, where they had sight of the Farrallones standing on the other side hard by the Riuer of Darien, and from Cape De la Vela vnto this place are two hundred leagues: and it standeth in 9. degrees and two parts of latitude. From thence they crossed ouer vnto the Iland of Iamaica, where they re∣freshed themselues. In Hispaniola they graued their ships because of the holes which certaine wormes of the water had eaten into the plankes. In that Countrey they got foure hundred markes of Gold, although the people there be more warlike then in Noua Spania: for they poi∣son their arrowes which they shoote.\n\nIn this same yeere 1502. Christopher Columbus entred the fourth time into his discouerie with foure ships, at the commandement of Don Fernando to seeke the Straight, which as they said [ 60] did diuide the land from the other side, and he carried with him Ferdinando his sonne. They went first to the Iland of Hispaniola, to Iamaica, to the Riuer Azua, to the Cape of Higueras, and vnto the Ilands Gamares, and to the Cape of Hunduras, that is to say, the Cape of the Depthes:\n\nfrom thence they sayled towards the East vnto the Cape Gracias a Dios and discouered the Pro∣uince and Riuer of Veragua, and Rio Grande, and others which the Indians call Hienra. And from thence he went to the Riuer of Crocodiles, which now is called Rio de Chagres, which hath his springs neere the South sea, within foure leagues of Panania, and runneth into the North Sea: and so he went vnto the Iland which hee called Isla de Bastimentos, that is the Ile of Victuals, and then to Puerto Bello, that is, the Faire Hauen, and so vnto N••mbre de Dios, and to Rio Francisco, and so to the Hauen of Retrete, and then to the Gulfe of Cabesa Cattina, and to the Ilands of Caper••sa, and lastly to the Cape of Marble, which is two hundred leagues vpon the Coast: from whence they began to turne againe vnto the Iland of Cuba, and from thence to Ia∣maica, where he grounded his ships being much spoyled and eaten with Wormes. [ 10]\n\nIn this yeere also 1502. Don Vasques de Gama being now Admirall, went againe into India with nineteene or twentie Caruels. Hee departed from Lisbon the tenth day of Februarie, and by the last day of that moneth he came to an anker at Cape Uerde, and from thence he went vnto Mosambique, and was the first that crost from that Iland into India: and hee discouered another in 4. degrees of Latitude, which he called the Iland of the Admirall, and there he tooke his la∣ding of Pepper and Drugs, and left there one Uincent Sodre to keepe the Coast of India with fiue ships. These were the first Portugals that with an Armie did runne along the Coast of A∣rabia Foelix. It is there so barren, that their Cattell and Camels are onely maintayned with drie Fish brought from the sea; whereof there is such plentie and abundance, that the Cats of the Countrey doe vse to take them. [ 20]\n\nIn the yeere following, as it is reported, one Antonie de Saldania, discouered the Iland which in old time was called Coradis, and now Socotora, and the Cape of Guardafu, which adioyneth vnto that Countrey.\n\nIn the yeere 1504. Roderigo de Bastidas obtayned licence of King Ferdinando, and by the meanes of Iohn d•• Ledesma, and others of Siuill, armed and furnished out two ships, hauing for his Pilot one Iohn de Cosa of Saint Marie Port, and he went to discouer that part of Tierra firma, where now standeth Carthagena, being in 10. degrees and a halfe of Northerly latitude. And it is said that they found the Captaine Luis de la Guerra; and they together tooke land in the He of Codego, where they tooke sixe hundred persons of the Sauages: And going farther along the Co••st they entred into the Gulfe of Vraba, where they found Sand mingled with Gold, being [ 30] the first that was brought to the King Don Ferdinando: from thence they returned to the Citie of Santo Domingo laden with Slaues without victuals, because they of the Countrey would not bargaine with them, which grew to their great trouble and griefe. In the latter end of this yeere dyed Ladie Isabella Queene of Castile: Which Queene while she liued would not suffer a∣ny man of Arragon, Catalunia, Valencia, nor any borne in the Countrey of Don Fernando her hus∣band to enter into these discoueries, saue those which were there Seruants, or by speciall com∣mandement, but onely the Castillians, Biscaines, and those which were of her owne Signories, by whom all the lands aforesaid were discouered.\n\nIn the yeere 1505. vpon our Lady day in March, Francisco de Almeida Viceroy of India, tooke his course with two and twentie sayles towards India as now is accustomed. He came vnto the [ 40] Citie of Quiloa, where he built a Fort, appointing one Peter Fereira to bee Captayne thereof: and beyond Melind•• hee trauersed to the Iland of Angediua, where he placed as Captayne one Emmanuell Passauia. In Cananor also he built another Fort, giuing the Captainship of it to Lau∣rence de Brit••. In Cochin he did the like, where Don Alfonso de Noronia was made Captayne. This yeere one Peter de Anhaya did build the Fortresse of Sofala, whereof also himselfe was made Captayne. In the latter end of this yeere, the Viceroy commanded his Sonne, whose name was Don Laurenzo to make some entrie vpon the Ilands of Maldiua, and with contrarie weather he arriued at the Ilands, which of ancient time were called Tragan••, but the Moores called them Y••ter••be••ero, and wee call them Ceilan: where he went on land, and made peace with the peo∣ple there, and afterward came backe vnto Cochin, sayling along the Coast and fully discouering [ 50] it. In the middest of this Iland, there stands a Rocke of stone very high hauing the signe of the foot of a man vpon the top of it, which they say to be the footstep of Adam, when he went vp into the Heauens, and the Indians haue it in great reuerence.\n\nIn the yeere 1506. after the death of the Queene of Spaine, King Philip and Queene Ioan his wife, came into Spaine to take possession thereof, and King Don Fernando went into Arragon being his owne Patrimonie. In this same yeere the said King Philip dyed, and then Fernando came againe to gouerne Spaine, and hee gaue licence vnto all Spaniards to goe vnto the New Land, & to the Antiles, but not to the Portugals. In this yeere & in the month of May Christopher Columbus dyed, and his Son Don Diego Columbus succeeded in his roome (Ad〈…〉〈…〉rall of the West Indies. In the yeere 1506. in the moneth of March Tristan de Acunna and Alfonso de Albuquerque [ 60] went into India with 14. ships in their company, & sayled til they came to an anker at the Town of Bezequiche, where they refreshed themselues: and before they came to the Cape of Bona Spe∣rança in 37. degrees they found certaine Ilands, which now are named the Isles of Tristan de Acunna, where they had such a tempest that therewithall the Fleet was disperced. Tristan de A∣cunna\n\nand Alfanso de Albuquerque went vnto Mosambique, and Aluaro Telez ranne so farre that he came to the Iland of Samatra, and so backe againe vnto the Cape of G〈…〉〈…〉dafu; h〈…〉〈…〉g disco∣uered many Ilands, Sea, and Lands neuer seene before that time of any Portugall: E〈…〉〈…〉 Te∣lez de Meneses was also driuen without the great Iland of S〈…〉〈…〉ce and he 〈…〉〈…〉g the coast thereof, and arriued at last at Mosambique, and there met with Tristan de Acun〈…〉〈…〉, who was the first Captaine that wintred there; and by them it was to〈…〉〈…〉, that in this Iland was much▪ G〈…〉〈…〉ger, Cloues and Siluer: whereupon he went and discouered much of it within the land; b•••• ••••nding nothing he came backe againe vnto Mosambique; from whence he sayled vnto Melinde, and ran along that coast and entred into Braua, and from thence they ••••ost ouer to the Iland of Soc〈…〉〈…〉a, where they built a Fortresse, and made one Do•• Antonio de No••o••ia Captaine thereof.\n\nIn the yeere 1507. in the moneth of August, Tristan de Acunna tooke shipping for Indi••, and [ 10] Alfonso de Albuquerque remained there with fiue or sixe ships to keepe the coast and entr〈…〉〈…〉 of the Straight; but being not therewith satisfied hee tooke his course ouer vnto Arabia, and 〈…〉〈…〉ng along that coast he doubled the Cape of Rosalgate, standing vnder the Tropike of C〈…〉〈…〉.\n\nIn the yeere 1509. one Diego Lopez de Sequeira, went out of Lisbon with 〈…〉〈…〉e sayle vnto the I∣land of S. Laurence, and continued in his voyage almost a yeere, and in the moneth of May the same yeere he arriued in Cochin, where the Viceroy gaue him one ship more and in the begin∣ning of the moneth of September, he tooke his course vnto Mal••coa passing between the Ilands of Nicubar, and many others: He went also to the land of Samarta to the Cities of Pe〈…〉〈…〉 and Pa∣cem, and all along by all that Coast vnto the Iland of A Poluoreira, and the flats of Capacia: and from thence hee went ouer vnto Malacc••, standing in 2. degrees of latitude toward the North: but in that Citie the people killed & tooke Prisoners some of his men: and thereupon he turned backe againe into India, hauing discouered in this voyage 500. leagues. This Iland of Samatra is the first land wherein wee knew Mans fles•• to bee eaten by certaine people which liue in the Mountaines called Bacas, who vse to gild their t••••th. They hold opinion that the flesh of the black people is sweeter then the flesh of the white. The Buffe••, Kine and Hens which are in that Countrey are in their flesh as blacke as any inke. They say that there are certaine people there called Daraqus Dara which haue tailes like vnto sheepe; and some of their Wells yeeld Oyle.\n\nThe King of P••dir is reported to haue a Riuer in his land running with Oyle: which is a thing not to be maruelled at, seeing it is found written, that in Bactria there is also a Well of Oyle: it is farther said, that there groweth here a Tree, the joyce whereof is strong poyson, and if it touch the blood of a man he dyeth immediately: but if a man doe drinke of it, it is a soueraigne reme∣die [ 30] against poyson, so seruing both for life, and death. Here also they doe coyne pieces of Gold which they call Diachmas, brought into the land as they say by the Romans: which seemeth to haue some resemblance of truth: because that from that place forward there is no ••oyned gold: but that which is thus coyned doth run currant in the buying of Merchandise and other things.\n\nIn the yeere 1508. one Alfonso de Hoida with the fauour of D••n Fernando purposed to goe vn∣to Tierra firma to conquer the Prouince of Darien. He went forth at his owne charges, and dis∣couered The firme Land, where it is called Vraba, which he named Castil•••• del Or••, that is Golden Castilia, because of the Gold which they found among the sand along the Coast: And they were the first Spaniards that did this. Alfonso de Hoida went first from the Iland of Hispaniola and the [ 40] Citie of San Domingo with foure Ships and three hundred Souldiers, leauing behind him the Bacheler Anciso, who afterwards compiled a Booke of these Discoueries: And after him there went also one ship with victuals, munition, and 150. Spaniards. He went on land at Carthagena: but there the people of the Countrey tooke, slew and eate seuentie of his Souldiers, whereupon he grew very weake. In this yeere 1508. one Diego de Niquesa, prepared seuen ships in the Port of B••ata to goe vnto Veragua, and carried in them almost 800. men. When he came to Carthage∣na, he found there Alfonso de Hoieda sore spoyled with his former losse: but then they both ioy∣ned together, and went on land and auenged themselues of the people. And in this voyage Die∣go de Niquesa went and discouered the Coast called Nombre de Dios, and went vnto the sound of Darien, and called it Puerto de Misas, which is vpon the Riuer of Pito. When they were come vn∣to [ 50] Veragua, he went on shore with his Armie, his Souldiers being out of hope to returne to Hi∣spaniola. Alfonso de Hoida began a Fortresse in Caribana against the Caribes; which was the first Towne that the Spaniards builded in the Firme land: and in Nombre de Dios they built another, and called it Nuestra Sennora de la Antigua. They builded also the Towne of Vraba. And there they left for their Captaine and Lieutenant one Francis Pizarro, who was there much troubled. They builded other Townes also, whose names I here omit. But these Captaines had not that good successe which they hoped for.\n\nIn the yeere 1509. the second Admirall Don Diego Columbus went into the Iland of Hispanio∣la with his wife and houshold: And she being a Gentlewoman carried with her many other wo∣men of good Families, which were there married, and so the Spaniards & Castilians began to peo∣ple [ 60] the Countrey: for Don Fernando the King had giuen them licence to discouer and people the Townes of Hispaniola; so that the same place grew to bee famous and much frequented. The foresaid Admirall also gaue order to people the Iland of Cuba, which is very great and large\n\nand placed there as his Lieutenant one Diego Velasques, who went with his father in the se∣cond voyage.\n\nIn the yeere 1511. in the moneth of Aprill Alfonso de Albuquerque went from the Citie of Cochin vnto Malacca. In which yeere and moneth the Chineans went from Malacca into their owne countrey, and Alfonso sent with them for Master a Portugall called Duarte Fernandes, with letters also and order vnto the King of the Mantias, which now is called Sian standing in the South. They passed through the Streight of Cincapura, and sailed towards the North, we••t along the coast of Patane vnto the Citie of Cuy, and from thence to Odia, which is the chiefe Citie of the Kingdome, standing in 14. degrees of Northerly latitude. The King greatly ho∣noured and welcomed Duarte Fernandes being the first Portugall that hee had seene, and with him hee sent backe Ambassadours to Albuquerque. They passed ouer land towards the west vn∣to [ 10] the Citie of Tanazerim standing vpon the sea on the other side in 12. degrees, where they imbarked themselues in two ships, and sailed along the coast vnto the Citie of Malacca, lea∣uing it all discouered.\n\nThe people of this countrey of Sian are people that eate of all kinde of beasts, or vermine. They haue a delight to carrie round bels within the skin of their priuie members: which is for∣bidden to the King and the religious people. It is said that of all other people of those parts they be most vertuous and honest. They commend themselues much for their chastitie and po∣uertie. They bring no hennes nor doues vp in their houses. This Kingdome hath in length two hundred and fiftie leagues, and in breadth eightie. Of this only Kingdome the King may [ 20] bring forth into the field thirtie thousand Elephants, when hee goeth to warre, besides those which remaine in the Cities for the guarde of them. The King much esteemeth a white Elephant and a red one also, that hath his eyes like vnto flaming fire.\n\nThere is in this countrey a certaine small vermine, which vseth to cleaue fast to the trunke of the Elephant, and draweth the bloud of the Elephant, and so he dieth thereof. The skull of this vermine is so hard, that the shot of an handgun cannot enter it: they haue in their liuers the fi∣gures of men and women, which they call Toketa, and are much like vnto a Man-drake. And they affirme, that hee which hath one of them about him cannot die with the stroke of any iron They haue also wilde Kine in this countrey, in the heads of whom they finde stones, which are of vertue to bring good hap and fortune to Merchants. [ 30]\n\nAfter that Duarte Fernandes had beene with the Mantales or people of Sian, Alfonso de Al∣buquerque sent thither a Knight called Ruy Nunnez de Acunna with letters and Ambassage vn∣to the King of the Seguies, which we call Pegu. He went in a Iunco of the countrey in sight of the Cape Rachado, and from thence went vnto the Citie of Pera which standeth fast by the Riuer Salano, and many other Villages standing all along this Riuer, where Duarte Fernandes had beene before, vnto the Cities of Tanazerim and of Martauan, standing in 15. degrees to∣ward the North, and the Citie of Pegu standeth in 17. This was the first Portugull, which tra∣uailed in that Kingdome: and hee gaue good information of that Countrey, and of the people which vse to weare bels in their priuities euen as the Mantales doe.\n\nIn the end of this yeere 1511. Alfonso de Albuquerque sent three s••••ps to the Ilands of Banda, and Maluco. And there went as Generall of them one Antonio de Breu, and with him [ 40] also went one Francis Serrano: and in these ships there were 120. persons. They passed through the Streight of Saban, and along the Iland of Samatra, and others, leauing them on the left hand, towards the east: and they called them the Salites. They went also to the Ilands of Pa∣limbam and La Puparam; from whence they sailed by the noble Iland of Ia••••, and they ranne their course East, sailing betweene it and the Iland Madura. The people of this are very war∣like and strong, and doe little regard their liues. The women also are there hired for the wars and they fall out often together, and kill one another, as the Mocos doe, delighting onely in shedding of bloud.\n\nBeyond the Iland of Iaua they sailed along by another called Bali: and then came also vnto [ 50] others called Auiaue, Zambaba, Solor, Galao, Mallua, Vitara, Rosalanguin, and Arus, from whence are brought delicate birds, which are of great estimation because of their feathers: they came also to other Ilands lying in the same parallell on the South side in 7. or 8. degrees of Latitude. And they be so neere the one to the other, that they seeme at the first to bee one en∣tire and maine land. The course by these Ilands is aboue fiue hundred leagues. The Ancient Cosmographers call all these Ilands by the name Iauos: but late experience hath found their names to bee verie diuers, as you see. Beyond these there are other Ilands toward the North, which are inhabited with whiter people going arraied in shirts, doublets and slops like vnto the Portugals, hauing also money of siluer. The Gouernours among them doe carrie in their hands red staues, whereby they seeme to haue some affinitie with the people of China. There [ 60] are other Ilands and people about this place, which are redde, and it is reported that they are of the people of China.\n\nAntonie de Breu and those that went him, tooke their course toward the North, where is a small Iland called Gumnape or Ternate, from the highest place whereof there fall continually\n\ninto the Sea flakes or streames like vnto fire; which is a wonderfull thing to behold. From thence they went to the Ilands of Burro and Amboino, and came to an anchor in an hauen of it called Guliguli, where they went on land and tooke a Village standing by the Riuer, where they found dead men hanging in the houses; for the people there are eaters of mans flesh. Here the Portugals burnt the ship wherein Francis Serrano was, for she was old and rotten. They went to a place on the other side standing in 8. degrees toward the South, where they laded cloues, nutmegs, and mace in a Iunco or Barke which Francis Serrano brought here. They say that not farre from the Ilands of Banda there is an Iland, where there breedeth nothing else but Snakes, and the most are in one caue in the middest of the land. This is a thing not much to be wondred at; for as much as in the Leuant Sea hard by the Iles of Maiorca and Minorca there is [ 10] another Iland of old named Ophiusa, and now Fornientera, wherein there is great abundance of these vermine: and in the rest of the Ilands lying by it there are none.\n\nIn the yeere 1512. they departed from Banda toward Malacca, and on the Baxos or flats of Luzapinho, Francis Serrano perished in his Iunke or Barke, from whence escaped vnto the Ile of Mindanao nine or ten Portugals which were with him, and the Kings of Maluco sent for them These were the first Portugals that came to the Ilands of Cloues, which stand from the Equino∣ctiall line towards the North in one degree, where they liued seuen or eight yeeres.\n\nThe Iland of Gumnape now called Ternate is much to be admired, for that it casteth out fire. There were some Princes of the Mores and couragious Portugals which determined to go neere to the firie place to see what it was; but they could neuer come neere it. But Antonie Galuano [ 20] hearing of it, vndertooke to goe vp to it, and did so, and found a riuer so extreame cold that he could not suffer his hand in it, nor yet put any of the water into his mouth: And yet this place standeth vnder the line, where the sunne continually burneth. In these Ilands of Maluco there is a kinde of men that haue spurres on their ankles like vnto Cocks. And it was told me by the King of Tydore, that in the Ilands of Batochina there were people that had tayles, and had a thing like vnto a dug betweene their cods, out of the which there came milke. There are small hennes also which lay their egges vnder the ground aboue a fathome and a halfe, and the egges are bigger then ducks egges, and many of these hennes are blacke in their flesh. There are hogs also with hornes, and parats which prattle much, which they call Noris. There is also a riuer of water so hot, that whatsoeuer liuing creature commeth into it, their skins will come off, and [ 30] yet fish breede in it. There are crabs which be verie sweete, and so strong in their clawes, that they will breake the iron of a Pikeaxe. There bee others also in the sea little and hairie, but whosoeuer eateth of them dieth immediately. There be likewise certaine oysters, which they doe call Bras, the shels whereof haue so large a compasse, that they doe Christen in them. In the Sea also there are liuely stones, which doe grow and increase like vnto fish, whereof verie good lime is made: and if they let it lye when it is taken out of the water, it loseth the strength and it neuer burneth after. There is also a certaine tree, which beareth flowers at the sun set, which fall downe as soone as they be growne. There is a fruit also, as they say, whereof if a woman that is conceaued of child eateth, the child by and by mooueth. There is further a kind of herbe there growing, which followeth the Sunne, and remooueth after it, which is a verie [ 40] strange and maruailous thing.\n\nIn the yeere 1512. In the moneth of Ianuarie Alfonsus de Alhuquerque went backe from Malaca vnto Goa, and the ship wherein he went was lost, and the rest went from his compa∣nie. Simon de Andrada, and a few Portugals were driuen vnto the Ilands of Maldina, being ma∣ny and full of palme trees: and they stand lowe by the water: which stayed there til they knew what was become of their Gouernour. These were the first Portugals that had seene those I∣lands, wherein there growe Cocos, which are verie good against all kind of poyson.\n\nIn this yeere 1512. there went out of Castile one Iohn de Solis borne in Lisbon, and chiefe Pi∣lot vnto Don Fernando. And he hauing licence went to discouer the coast of Brasil. Hee tooke the like course that the Pinsons had done: hee went also to the Cape of Saint Augustine, and [ 50] went forwards to the South, coasting the shoare and land, and he came vnto the Port De Lagoa: and in 35 degrees of southerly latitude he found a riuer which they of Brasil call Parana-guaz••, that is, The great Water. He saw there signes of siluer, and therefore called it Rio de Plata, that is, The Riuer of siluer. And it is said that at that time he went farther because he liked the coun∣trey well: but he returned backe againe into Spaine, and made account of all things to Don Fernando, demaunding of the King the gouernment thereof, which the King granted him. Whereupon he prouided three ships and with them in the yeere 1515. he went againe into that Kingdome; but he was there slaine. These Solisses were great discouerers in those parts, and spent therein their liues and goods.\n\nIn the same yeere 1512. Iohn Ponce of Leon, which had beene gouernour of the Ile of Saint [ 60] Iohn armed two ships and went to seeke the Ile of Boyuca, where the naturals of the countrey reported to be a Wel, which maketh olde men young. Whereupon he laboured to finde it out, and was in searching of it the space of sixe moneths, but could finde no such thing. Hee entered into the Ile of Bimini; and discouered a point of the firme land, standing in 29. degrees towards\n\nthe North vpon Easter-day, and therefore he named it Florida. And because the Land seemed to yeeld Gold and Siluer and great riches, hee begged it of the King Don Fernando, but hee died in the Discouerie of it, as many more haue done.\n\nIn the yeere 1513. Vasco Nunnes de Valboa hearing speech and newes of the South Sea, de∣termined to goe thither, although his companie disswaded him from that action. But being a man of good valour with those Souldiers that he had, being two hundred and ninetie, hee resol∣ued to put himselfe into that ieoperdie. Hee went therefore from Dariene the first day of Sep∣tember, carying some Indians of the Countrie with him to be his Guides, and he Marched ouer∣thwart the Land sometimes quietly, sometimes in Warre: and in a certaine place called Careca he found Negroes Captiues with Curled haire. This Valboa came to the sight of the South Sea on the 25. day of the said Moneth, and on Saint Michaels day came vnto it: where hee Imbarked [ 10] himselfe against the will of Chiapes, who was the Lord of that Coast, who wished him not to do so because it was verie dangerous for him. But he desirous to haue it knowne. that he had beene vp∣on those Seas, went forwards, and came backe againe to Land in safetie, and with great content∣ment, bringing with him good store of Gold, Siluer, and Pearles, which there they tooke. For which good seruice of his Don Ferdinando the King greatly fauoured and honoured him.\n\nThis yeere 1513. in the Moneth of Februarie, Alfonsus de Albuquerque went from the Citie of Goa towards the Streight of Mecha with twentie Ships. They arriued at the Citie of Aden and battered it, and passed forward and entred into the Streight. They say that they saw a Crosse in the Element and worshipped it. They Wintered in the Iland of Camaran. This was the first Portu∣gall [ 20] Captain that gaue information of those Seas, and of that of Persia, being things in the World of great accompt.\n\nIn the yeere 1514. and in the Moneth of May, there went out of Saint Lucar, one Pedro Arias de Auila at the commandement of Don Ferdinando. He was the fourth Gouernour of Castillia del Oro or Golden Castile: for so they named the Countries of Dariene, Carthagena, and Vraba, and that Countrie which was newly Conquered. Hee caried with him his Wife the Ladie Elizabeth, and one thousand fiue hundred men in seuen Ships; and the King appointed, Vasco Nunnez de Valboa Gouernour of the South Sea and of that Coast.\n\nIn the beginning of the yeere 1515. the Gouernour Pedro Arias de Auila, sent one Gaspar Mo∣rales with one hundted and fiftie men vnto the Gulfe of Saint Michael, to Discouer the Ilands of [ 30] Tararequi, Chiapes, and Tumaccus. There was a Casique Valboas friend, which gaue him many Canoas or Boates made of one Tree to Rowe in, wherein they passed vnto the Iland of Pearles: the Lord whereof resisted them at their comming on Land. But Chiapes and Tumaccus did pacific him in such order, that the Captaine of the Isle had them home vnto his House, and made much of them, and receiued Baptisme at their hands, naming him Pedro Arias after the Gouernours name, and hee gaue vnto them for this a Basket full of Pearles, waying one hundred and tenne pounds, whereof some were as bigge as Hasell-nuts, of twentie, twentie fiue, twentie sixe, or thir∣tie one Carats: and euerie Carat is foure Graines. There was giuen for one of them, one thou∣sand and two hundred Duckets. This Iland of Tararequi standeth in fiue Degrees of Latitude to∣wards the North.\n\nIn this verie yeere 1515. in the Moneth of May, Alfonsus de Albuquerque Gouernour of India, [ 40] sent from the Citie of Ormuz one Fernando Gomes de Lemos as Ambassadour vnto Xec or Shaugh Ismael King of Persia: and it is reported that they trauailed in it three hundred Leagues, and thar it is a pleasant Countrie like vnto France, This Xec or Shaugh Ismael went on Hunting and fish∣ing for Troutes, whereof there are many. And there be the fairest Women in all the world. And so Alexander the Great affirmed, when hee called them The Women with Golden eyes. And this yeeee this worthie Vice-roy, Alfonsus de Albuquerque died.\n\nIn the yeere 1416. and one hundred yeeres after the taking of Ceuta in Barbarie, Lopez Sua∣res being Gouernour of India, there was a dispatch made by the commandemenr of the Kings Highnesse, vnto one Fernando Perez de Andrada to passe to the great Countrie and Kingdome of [ 50] China. He went from the Citie of Cochin in the Moneth of Aprill. They receiued Pepper, being the principall Marchandise to be sold in all China of any value: And hee was farther commanded by the King Don Emmanuel to goe also to Bengala with his Letter and dispatch to a Knight called Iohn Coelo. This was the first Portugall as farre as I know, which drunke of the water of the Riuer Ganges. This yeere 1516. died Don Fernando King of Spaine.\n\nIn the yeere 1517. this Fernando Perez went vnto the Citie of Malacha, and in the Moneth of Iune he departed from thence towords China with eight Sailes, foure Portugals and the others Malayans. He arriued in China: And because hee could not come on Land without an Ambas∣sage, there was one Thomas Perez which had order for it: and he went from the Citie of Canton, where they came to an Anker: They went by Land foure hundred Leagues, and came vnto the [ 60] Citie of Pekin, where the King was for this Prouince and Countrie is the biggest that is in the World. It beginneth at Sailana in twentie Degrees of Latitude towards the North, and it endeth almost in fiftie Degrees. Which must be fiue hundred Leagues in length: and they say that it containeth three hundred Leagues in bredth, Fernando Perez was fourteene Moneths in the Isle\n\nDa Veniaga, learning as much as he could of the Countrie, according as the King his Master had commanded him. And although one Raphael Perestrello had beene there in a Iunke or Barke of certaine Marchants of Malaca, yet vnto Fernando Perez there ought to be giuen the praise of this Discouerie: as wel for that he had commandement from the King, as in discouering so much with Thomas Perez by Land, and George Mascarenhas by Sea, and for coasting vnto the Citie of Fo∣quiem standing in twentie foure Degrees of Latitude.\n\nIn the same yeere 1517. Charles, which afterward was Emperour, came into Spaine and tooke possession thereof. And in the same yeere Francis Fernandes de Gordona, Christopher Morantes, and Lopez Ochoa armed three Ships at their owne proper charges from the Iland of Cuba. They had also with them a Barke of Diego Velasques, who then was Gouernour: They came on Land [ 10] in Iucatan standing in twentie Degrees of Latitude, at a Point which they called Punta de las Du∣ennas; that is to say, The point of Ladies, which was the first place wherein they had seene Temples and Buildings of Lime & Stone. The people here goe better Apparelled then in any other place.\n\nIn the yeere 1518. Lopez Suares commanded Don Iohn de Silueira to goe to the Ilands of Maldiua: and he made peace with them: and from thence hee went to the Citie of Chatigam, situated on the mouth of the Riuer Ganges, vnder the Tropicke of Cancer. For this Riuer, and the Riuer Indus, which standeth an hundred Leagues beyond the Citie of Diu, and that of Canton in China, doe all fall into the Sea vnder one Paralell or Latitude. And although before that time Fernando Perez had beene commanded to goe to Bengala, yet notwithstanding Iohn de Silueira ought to beare away the commendation of this Discouerie: because he went as Captaine Gene∣rall, and remained there longest. learning the commodities of the Countrie, and maners of the [ 20] people.\n\nIn the said yeere 1518. the first day of May, Diego Velasques Gouernour of the Iland of Cuba, sent his Nephew Iohn de Grisalua, with foure Ships and two hundred Souldiers to discouer the Land of Iucatan. And they found in their way the Iland of Cosumel, standing towards the North in nineteene Degrees, and named it Santa Cruz, because they came to it the third of May. They coasted the Land lying on the left hand of the Gulfe, and came to an Iland called Ascensi∣on, because they came vnto it vpon Ascension day: They went vnto the end of it standing in six∣teene Degrees of Latitude: from whence they came backe because they could finde no place to goe out at: and from hence they went round about it to another Riuer, which they called The Riuer of Grisalua, standing in seuenteene Degrees of Latitude: the People thereabout troubled [ 30] them sore, yet notwithstanding they brought from thence some Gold, Siluer, and Feathers, be∣ing there in great estimation, and so they turned backe againe to the Iland of Cuba.\n\nIn the same yeere 1518. one Francis Garay armed three Ships in the Ile of Iamaica at his owne charges, and went towards the Point of Florida, standing in twentie fiue Degrees towards the North, seeming to them to be an Iland most pleasant, thinking it better to people Ilands then the firme Land, because they could best Conquer them and keepe them. They went there on Land, but the people of Florida killed many of them, so that they durst not Inhabit it. So they Sayled along the Coast, and came vnto the Riuer of Panuco, standing fiue hundred Leagues from the point of Florida in Sayling along the Coast; but the People resisted them in euerie place. Many of them also were killed in Chila, whom the Sauages Flayed and eate, hanging vp their Skinnes [ 40] in their Temples, in memoriall of their valiantnesse. Notwithstanding all this, Francis de Garay went thither the next yeere and begged the Gouernment of that Countrie of the Emperour, be∣cause he saw in it some shew of Gold and Siluer.\n\nIn the yeere 1519. in the Moneth of Februarie, Fernando Cortes went from the Iland of Cuba, to the Land which is called Noua Spania with eleuen ships and fiue hundred and fiftie Spaniards in them.\n\nThe Countrie of Tenich and vp the Riuer were not subiect to Muteçuma, but had Warre with him, and would not suffer the Mexicans to enter into their Territorie. They sent Ambassadours vnto Cortes with presents, offering him their estate, and amitie; whereof Muteçuma was nothing glad. They which went to Tututepec standing neere the South Sea, did also bring with them ex∣amples [ 50] of Gold, and praised the pleasantnesse of the Countrie, and the multitude of good Har∣bours vpon that Coast, shewing to Cortes a Cloth of Cotten Wooll, all Wouen with goodly workes, wherein all the Coast with the Hauens and Creekes were set foorth. But this thing then could not be prosecuted, by reason of the comming of Pamphilus de Naruaez into the Countrie, who set all the Kingdome of Mexico in an vprore.\n\nIn this yeere 1519. the tenth day of August, one Fernande de Magallanes, departed from Siuill with fiue Ships toward the Ilands of Maluco.\n\nAbout this time Pope Leo the tenth, sent one Paulis Centurio as Ambassador to the great Duke of Moscouie, to wish him to send into India an Armie alongst the Coast of Tartarie. And by the reasons of this Ambassadour, the said Duke was almost perswaded vnto that action, if other in∣conueniences [ 60] had not letted him.\n\nIn this same yeere 1520. in Februarie Diego Lopes de Sequeir, Gouernour of India, went to∣wards the Streight of Mecha, and carried with him the Ambassadour of Presbyter Iohn, and\n\nRoderigo de Lima who also went as Ambassador to him. They came vnto the Iland of Macua standing in the Red Sea on the side of Africa in 17. degrees towards the North: where he set the Ambassadors on land, with the Portugals that should goe with them. Peter de Couillan had beene there before, being sent thither by King Iohn the Second of Portugall: but yet Francis Aluarez gaue principall light and knowledge of that Countrie.\n\nIn the yeere 1520. the Licenciate Lucas Vasques de Aillon and other Inhabitants of Saint Domingo furnished two ships, and sent them to the Iles of Lucayos to get slaues, and finding none they passed along by the firme land beyond Florida vnto certaine Countries called Chi∣cora and Gualdape, vnto the Riuer Iordan and the Cape of Saint Helena standing in 32. degrees toward the North. They of the Countrie came downe to the Sea side to see the ships, as ha∣uing neuer before seene the like: The Spaniards went on land, where they receiued good en∣tertainment, [ 10] and had giuen vnto them such things as they lacked. But they brought many of them into their ships, and then set sayle and brought them away for slaues: but in the way one of their ships sunke, and the other was also in great hazard. By this newes the Licenciate Ail∣lon knowing the wealth of the Countrie, begged the gouernment thereof of the Emperour, and it was giuen him: whither he went to get money to pay his debt.\n\nIn the yeere 1521. in December Emmanuel King of Portugall died, and after him his sonne King Iohn the Third raigned.\n\nIn the yeere 1522. in Ianuarie one Gilgonzales armed foure ships in the Iland of Tararequi standing in the South Sea, with intent to discouer the Coast of Nicaragua, and especially a [ 20] Straight or Passage from the South Sea into the North Sea. And sayling along the Coast hee came vnto an Hauen called Saint Vincent, and there landed with an hundred Spaniards and cer∣taine horsemen, and went within the Land two hundred leagues, and he brought with him two hundred pesoes of gold, and so came backe againe to Saint Uincent: where he found his Pi∣lot Andrew Nigno, who was as farre as Tecoantepec, in 16. degrees to the North, and had sailed three hundred leagues: from whence they returned to Panama, and so ouer land to Hispaniola.\n\nIn the same yeere 1522. in the moneth of Aprill the other ship of Magallanes called The Tri∣uitie went from the Iland of Tidore, where in was Captaine Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, shaping their course toward Noua Spania: and because the winde was scant, they steared toward the North-east into 16. degrees, where they found two Ilands, and named them the Iles of Saint [ 30] Iohn, and in that course they came to another Iland in 20. degrees, which they named La Grie∣ga, where the simple people came into their ships, of whom they kept some to shew them in Noua Spania: They were in this course foure moneths, vntill they came into 42. degrees of Northerly latitude, where they did see Sea-fishes called Seales and Tunies. And the climate seemed vnto them comming newly out of the heate, to be so cold and vntemperate, that they could not well abide it, and therefore they turned backe againe to Tidore, being thereunto en∣forced also by contrary windes. These were the first Spaniards which had beene in so high a latitude toward the North. And there they found one Antonie de Britto building a Fortresse, which tooke from them their goods, and sent eight and forty of them prisoners to Malaca.\n\nIn this yeere 1522. Cortes desirous to haue some Hauens on the South Sea, and to discouer [ 40] the Coast of Noua Spania on that side, whereofhe had knowledge in Muteçuma his time, (be∣cause he thought by that way to bring the drugs from Maluco and Banda, and the spicery from Iaua, with lesse trauell and danger) he sent foure Spaniards with their Guides to Tecoantepec, Quahutemallan, and other Hauens: where they were well receiued, and brought some of the people with them to Mexico: And Cortes made much of them; and afterwards sent ten Pilots thither to search the Seas thereabout. They went seuenty leagues in the Sea but found no Ha∣uen. One Casique or Lord called Cuchataquir vsed them well, and sent with them to Cortes two hundred of his men with a Present of gold and siluer, and other things of the Countrie: and they of Tecoantepec did the like: and not long after, this Casique sent for aide to Cortes against his neighbours which did warre against him. [ 50]\n\nIn the yeere 1523. Cortes sent vnto him for his aide Peter de Aluarado, with two hundred Souldiers footmen, and fortie horsemen, and the Casiques of Tecoantepec and Quah••temallan as∣ked them for the Monsters of the Sea which came thither the yeere past, meaning the ships of Gil Gonzales de Auila, being greatly amazed at the sight of them, and wondring much more when they heard, that Cortes had bigger then those: and they painted vnto them a mightie Carrake with sixe Masts, and Sayles and Shroudes, and men armed on horsebacke. This Alua∣rado went through the Countrie and builded there a Citie of Saint Iago or Saint Iames, and a Towne which he called Segura leauing certaine of his people in it.\n\nIn the same yeere 1523. in the moneth of May Antonie de Britto being Captaine of the Iles of Maluco sent his Cousin Simon de Breu to learne the way by the Ile of Borneo to Malaca: [ 60] They came in sight of the Ilands of Manada and Panguensara: They went through the Straight of Treminao and Tagui; and to the Ilands of Saint Michael standing in 7. degrees, and from thence discouered the Ilands of Borneo, and had sight of Pedra branca or the White stone, and passed through the Straight of Cincapura, and so to the Citie of Malaca.\n\nIn this same yeere 1523. Cortes went with three hundred footmen; and an hundred and fifty horsemen, and forty thousand Mexicans, to Pannco, both to discouer it better, and also to in∣habite it and withall to bee reuenged vpon them which had killed and eaten the Souldiers of Francis Garay. They of Panuco resisted him, but Cortes in the end ouerthrew them, and con∣quered the Countrie: And hard by Chila vpon the Riuer he built a Towne, and named it San∣to Stephano del puerto, leauing in it an hundred footmen, and thirty horsemen, and one Peter de Palleio for Lieu••enant. This Iourney cost him seuenty sixe thousand Castillians, besides the Spa∣niards, Horses, and Mexicans which died there.\n\nIn this yeere 1523. Francis de Garay made nine Ships and two Brigandines to goe to Pa∣nuco, and to Rio de las Palmas, to be there as Gouernour: for that the Emperour had granted [ 10] vnto him from the Coast of Florida vnto Panuco, in regard of the charges which hee had beene at in that Discouerie. He carried with him eight hundred and fifty Souldiers, and an hundred and fortie Horses, and some Men out of the Iland of Iamaica, where he furnished his Fleet with munition for the warre: and he went vnto Xagua an Hauen in the Iland of Cuba, where he vnder∣stood that Cortes had peopled the coast of Panuco: & that it might not happen vnto him as it did to Pamphilus de Naruaez, he determined to take another companion with him, and desired the Doctor Zuazo to goe to Mexico and procure some agreement betweene Cortes and him. And they departed from Xagua each one about his businesse. Zuazo came in great ieopardie, and Garay went not cleere without. Garay arriued in Rio de las Palmas on Saint Iames his day, and then he sent vp the Riuer one Gonsaluo de Ocampo, who at his returne declared that it was an [ 20] euill and desart Countrie: but notwithstanding Garay went there on land with foure hundred footmen and some horsemen; and he commanded one Iohn de Grijatua to search the Coast, and he himselfe marched by land towards Panuco, and passed a Riuer which hee named Rio Mont∣alto; he entred into a great Towne where they found many Hennes, where with they refreshed themselues, and he tooke some of the people of Chila which he vsed for messengers to certaine places: And after great trauell comming to Panuco they found no victuals there by reason of the warres of Cortes, and the spoile of the Souldiers. Garay then sent one Gonzalo de Ocampo to Sant Isteitan del puerto to knowe whether they would receiue him or no. They had a good answere. But Cortes his men priuily by an ambushment tooke forty of Garayes horsemen, al∣leaging that they came to vsurpe the gouernment of another: and besides this misfortune he [ 30] lost foure of his ships: whereupon he left off to proceed any farther.\n\nWhile Cortes was preparing to set forward to Panuco: Francis de las Casas, and Roderigo de la Paz arriued at Mexico with Letters Patents, wherein the Emperour gaue the gouernment of Nueua Spagna and all the Countrie which Cortes had conquered to Cortes, and namely Panu∣co. Whereupon he stayed his Iourney. But hee sent Diego de Ocampo with the said Letters Patents, and Pedro de Aluarado with store of footmen and horsemen. Garay knowing this thought it best to yeeld himselfe vnto Cortes his hands, and to goe to Mexico; which thing he did hauing discouered a great tract of Land.\n\nIn this yeere 1523. Gil Gonzales de Auila made a Discouerie, and peopled a Towne called San Gil de buena vista, standing in 14. degrees toward the North, and almost in the bottome of the Bay called the Ascension or the Honduras. He began to conquer it because he best knew [ 40] the secrets thereof, and that it was a very rich Countrie.\n\nIn this yeere 1523. the sixt day of December Peter de Aluarado went from the Citie of Mexico by Cortes his commandement to discouer and conquer Qualiutemallan, Vilatlan, Chia∣pa, Xochnuxco, and other Townes toward the South Sea. He had with him three hundred Soul∣diers, an hundred and seuenty Horsemen, foure Field-pieces, and some Noblemen of Mexico, with people of the Countrie to aide him as well it the warre, as by the way being long. Hee went by Tecoantepec to Xochnuxco, and other places abouesaid with great trauell and losse of his men: but he discouered and subdued all the Countrie. There are in those parts certaine Hills that haue Alume in them, and out of which distilleth a certaine liquor like vnto Oyle, and Sulphur or Brimstone, whereof the Spaniards made excellent Gun-powder. He trauelled foure [ 50] hundred leagues in this Voyage, and passed certaine Riuers which were so hot, that they could not well endure to wade thorow them. Hee builded a Citie calling it Sant Iago de Quahute∣mallan. Peter de Aluarado begged the gouernment of this Countrie, and the report is that it was giuen him.\n\nIn the yeere 1523. the eight day of December Cortes sent Diego de Godoy with an hundred Footmen and thirty Horsemen, two Field-pieces, and many of his friends Indians vnto the Towne Del Espiritu santo: He ioyned himselfe with the Captaine of that Towne, and they went to Chamolla the head Citie of that Prouince, and that being taken all the Countrie grew quiet.\n\nIn the yeere 1524. in Februarie Cortes sent one Roderigo Rangel with an hundred and fifty [ 60] Spaniards & many of the Tlaxcallans and Mexicans against the Zapotecas and Nixticas, and vnto other Prouinces and Countries not so well discouered: they were resisted at the first, but quick∣ly put the people to the worst, and kept them for euer after in subiection. In this same yeere 1524. one Roderigo de Bastidas was sent to discouer, people, and gouerne the Countrie of Santa\n\nMartha: where he lost his life because hee would not suffer the Souldiers to take the spoile of a certaine Towne. They ioyned with Peter Uilla-forte, and he being sometimes his entire friend did helpe to kill him with Daggers lying in his Bed. Afterward Don Pedro de Lugo, and Don Alfonso his sonne were Gouernours of that place, which vsed themselues like couetous Tyrants; whereof grew much trouble.\n\nIn this same yeere also 1524. after that the Licenciate Lucas Vasques de Aillon had obtai∣ned of the Emperour the gouernment of Chicora, he armed for that purpose certaine Ships from the Citie of Santo Domingo and went to discouer the Countrie, and to inhabite it. but he was lost with all his companie, leauing nothing done worthie of memorie. And I cannot tell how it commeth to passe, except it bee by the iust iudgement of God, that of so much Gold and Precious stones as haue beene gotten in the Antiles by so many Spaniard;, little or none remai∣neth, [ 10] but the most part is spent and consumed, and no good thing done.\n\nIn this yeere 1524. Cortes sent one Christopher de Olid with a Fleet to the Iland of Cuba, to receiue the victuals and munition which Alonso de Contreras had prepared, and to discouer and people the Countrey about Cape De Higueras, and the Honduras; and to send Diego Hurtada de Mendoça by sea, to search the Coast from thence euen to Darien, to finde out the Straight which was thought to runne into the South sea, as the Emperour had commanded. He sent al∣so two ships from Panisco to search along the coast vnto Florida. Hee commanded also certaine Brigandines to search the coast from Zacatullan vnto Panama. This Christopher de Olid came to the Iland of Cuba, and made a league with Diego Volasquez against Cortes, and to set sayle and [ 20] went on land hard by Puerto de Cauallos standing in 10. degrees to the North, and built a Towne which he called Triumpho de la Cruz. Hee tooke Gil Fonzales de Auila prisoner, and kil∣led his nephew and the Spaniards that were with him, all sauing one Childe, and shewed him∣selfe an enemy to Cortes, who had spent in that expedition thirtie thousand Castellans of gold to doe him pleasure withall. Cortes vnderstanding hereof the same yeere 1524. in the moneth of October he went out of the Citie of Mexico, to seeke Christopher de Olid to bee reuenged of him, and also to discouer, carrying with him three hundred Spanish footmen and horsemen, and Quahutimoc King of Mexico, and other great Lords of the same Citie. And comming to the Towne called Lavilla del Espiritu santo, he required guides of the Lords of Tauasco and Xicalan∣co: and they sent him ten of their principall men for guides: who gaue him also a Map of Cot∣ton-wooll, [ 30] wherein was painted the situation of the whole Countrey from Xicalanco vnto Naco, and Nito, and euen as farre as Nicaragua, with their Mountaines. Hils, Fields, Meadowes, Val∣lies, Riuers, Cities, and Townes. And Cortes in the meane time sent for three ships which were at the Hauen of Medellin to follow him along the coast.\n\nIn this yeere 1524. they came to the Citie of Izancanac, where hee vnderstood that the King Quahutimoc and the Mexicans that were in his company were conspired against him and the Spaniards: for the which he hanged the King and two others of the chiefe: and so came to the Citie of Mazatlan, and after that to Tiaca, the head Citie of a Prouince so called standing in the middest of a Lake: and heere about they began to finde the traine of the Spaniards, which they went to seeke, and so they went to Zuzullin, and at length came to the Towne of Nito: from [ 40] Nito Cortes with his owne companie and all the Spaniards that hee found there, departed to the shore or strand called La Batade Sant Andres, and finding there a good hauen hee builded a Towne in that place and called it Natividad de nuestra Senora. From hence Cortes went to the Towne of Truxillo standing in the hauen of the Honduras, where the Spaniards dwelling there did entertaine him well: and while hee was there, there arriued a ship which brought newes of the stirre in Mexico in Cortes his absence: whereupon hee sent word to Gonsola de Sandoual to march with his companie from Naco to Mexico by land toward the South sea vnto Quahute∣mallan, because that is the vsuall plaine and safest way, and hee left as Captaine in Truxillo Fer∣nando de Saavedra his Cousen: and he himselfe went by sea along the Coast of Iucatan, to Chal∣chicoeca, now called Sant Iuan de Ullhua, and so to Medellin, and from thence to Mexico, where [ 50] hee was well receiued, hauing beene from thence eighteene moneths, and had gone fiue hun∣dred leagues trauelling often out of his way, and enduring much hardnesse.\n\nIn the yeere 1525. Francis Pizarro and Diego de Almagro, went from Panama to discouer Peru standing beyond the line toward the South, which they called Nueua Castillia. The Go∣uernour Pedro Arias would not entermeddle with this expedition, because of the euill newes which his Captayne Francis Uezerra had brought.\n\nIn the same yeere 1525. there was sent out of Spaine a Fleet of seuen ships, whereof was Captayne generall Don Garsia de Loaisa to the Ilands of Maluco. They went from the Citie of the Groine and passed by the Ilands of the Canaries, and went to Brasil, where they found an I∣land in two degrees, and named it Saint Mathew: and it seemed to be inhabited because they [ 60] found in it Orenge trees, Hogs, and Hens in caues, and vpon the rindes of most of the trees there were grauen Portugall letters, shewing that the Portugals had beene there seuenteene yeeres be∣fore that time. A Patach or Pinnesse of theirs passed the straight of M••gettane, hauing in her one Iohn de Resaga, and ranne all along the coast of Peru and Noua Spagna: They declared all\n\nthey declared all their successe vnto Cortes, and told him, that Frier Garsia de Loaisa was passed to the Ilands of Cloues. But of this fleete the Admirall onely came thither, wherein was Cap∣tayne one Martin Mingues de Carchoua: for Loaisa and the other Captaines dyed by the way. All the Moores of Maluco were found well affectioned to the Spaniards.\n\nIn the same yeere 1525. the Pilot Stephen Gomes, went from the Port of the Groine toward the North to discouer the straight vnto the Malucos by the North, to whom they would giue no charge in the fleete of Frier Garsia de Loaisa. But yet the Earle Don Fernando de Andrada, and the Doctor Beliram, and the Merchant Christopher de Sarro furnished a Gallion for him, and hee went from the Groine in Galicia to the Iland of Cuba, and to the point of Florida, sayling by day because he knew not the land. He passed the bay Angra, and the riuer Enseada, and so went o∣uer to the other side. It is also reported that he came to Cape Razo in 46. degrees to the North: [ 10] from whence he came backe againe to the Groine laden with Slaues. The newes hereof ranne by and by through Spaine, that hee was come home laden with Cloues as mistaking the word and it war carried to the Court of Spaine: but when the truth was knowne it turned to a plea∣sant jest. In this voyage Gomes was ten moneths.\n\nIn this yeere 1525. Don George de Meneses Captayne of Maluco, and with him Don Garcia Henriques, sent a foyst to discouer land towards the North, wherein went as Captaine one Die∣go de Rocha, and Gomes de Sequeira for Pilot. In 9. or 10. degrees they found certaine Ilands stan∣ding close together, and they called them the Ilands of Gomes de Sequeira, hee being the first Pi∣lot that discouered them. and they came backe againe by the Iland of Batochina.\n\nIn the yeere 1526. there went out of Siuill one Sebastian Cabota a Venetian by his father, but [ 20] borne at Bristoll in England, being chiefe Pilot to the Emperour, with foure ships toward Ma∣luco. They came to Pernambuco, and stayed there three moneths for a winde to double the Cape of Saint Augustine. In the Bay of Patos or of Ducks, the Admirall ship perished; & being with∣out hope to get to the Iles of Maluco, they there made a Pinnesse to enter vp the Riuer of Plate, and to search it. They ranne 60. leagues vp before they came to the barre: where they left their great ships, and with their small Pinnesses passed vp the Riuer Parana, which the Inhabitants count to bee the principall Riuer. Hauing rowed vp one hundred and twentie leagues, they made a Fortresse and stayed there aboue a yeere: and then rowed further till they came to the mouth of another Riuer called Paragioa, and perceiuing that the Countrey yeelded Gold and Siluer they kept on their course, and sent a Brigandine before; but those of the Countrey tooke [ 30] it: and Cabote vnderstanding of it thought it best to turne backe vnto their Fort, and there tooke in his men which he had left there, and so went downe the Riuer where his ships did ride, and from thence he sailed home to Siuill in the yeere 1530. leauing discouered about two hun∣dred leagues within this Riuer, reporting it to bee very Nauigable, and that it springeth out of a Lake named Bombo. It standeth in the firme land of the Kingdome of Peru, running through the Vallies of Xauxa, and meeteth with the Riuers Parso, Bulcasban, Cay, Parima, Hiucax, with others which make it very broad and great. It is said also, that out of this Lake runneth the Riuer called Rio de San Francesco; and by this meane the Riuers come to bee so great. For the Riuers that come out of Lakes are bigger then those which proceed from a Spring.\n\nIn the yeere 1527. one Pamphilus de Naruaez went out of Saint Lucar de Barameda, to bee [ 40] Generall of the coast and land of Florida, as farre as Rio de las Palmas, and had with him fiue Ships, sixe hundred Souldiers, one hundred Horses, besides a great summe and quantitie of Vi∣ctuals, Armour, Clothing and other things. Hee could not goe on land where his desire was but went on land somewhat neere to Florida with three hundred of his companie, some Horses, and some victuals, commanding the ships to goe to Rio de las Palmas; in which voyage they were almost all lost: and those which escaped passed great dangers, hunger and thirst.\n\nThis yeere 1527. when Cortes vnderstood by the Pinnesse aforesaid, that Don Garcia de Loai∣sa was passed by the Straight of Magelan, toward the Ilands of Cloues, hee prouided three ships to goe seeke him, and to discouer by that way of New Spaine as farre as the Iles of Malu∣co. There went as Gouernour in those ships one Aluaro de Saavedra Ceron, cousen vnto Cortes, [ 50] a man fit for that purpose. Hee made sayle from Ciuatlaneio, now named Saint Christopher stan∣ding in twentie degrees toward the North on All Saints day. They arriued at the Ilands which Magelan named The Pleasures: and from thence sayled to the Ilands, which Gomes de Sequeira had discouered, and not knowing thereof, they named them Islas de los Reyes, that is to say, The Iles of the Kings, because they came vnto them on Twelfe day. In the way Saavedra lost two ships of his company, of which they neuer after heard newes. But from Iland to Iland hee still sayled and came to the Iland of Candiga, where he bought two Spaniards for seuentie Ducats, which had beene of the companie of Frier Loaisa, who was lost thereabout. In the yeere 1528. in March, Saavedra arriued at the Ilands of Maluco, and came to an anker before the Ile of Gilo∣lo: hee found the sea calme and winde at will, without any tempests: and he tooke the distance [ 60] from thence to Noua Spagna to bee two thousand and fiftie leagues. At this time Martin Yuni∣guez de Carquiçano dyed, and Fernando de la Torre was chosen their Generall, who then was in the Citie of Tidore, who had there erected a Gallowes and had fierce warre with Don George de\n\nMeneses Captaine of the Portugals: and in a fight which they had the fourth day of May, Saa∣vedra tooke from him a Galiot and slew the Captaine thereof called Fernando de Baldaya, and in Iune hee returned towards New Spaine, hauing with him one Simon de Brito Patalin, and other Portugals, and hauing beene certayne moneths at Sea, he was forced backe vnto Tidore, where Patalin was beheaded and quartered, and his companions hanged.\n\nIn this yeere 1528. Cortes sent two hundred Footmen and 60. Horsmen, and many Mexicans to discouer and p"
