In the Renaissance, colonization and exploitation followed soon after travel and discovery. Spaniards and Portuguese were the vanguard of this movement in the Atlantic world, and it is not surprising that the city was among the institutions brought by them as part of their cultural heritage. What makes the story of the urban conquest of Latin America particularly interesting are the specific configurations of society in the cities of empire and the conscious use of the city as a symbol of imperium.

The objective of this paper is to analyze the functions and social organization of two of these cities, Mexico City and Salvador da Bahia, and to demonstrate that despite a variety of often striking differences, the social structures of both reflected similar solutions to the common problem of integrating newly-created groups into an already structured society.

2 Mexico City is always referred to by Mexicans as Mexico or “the capital.” Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos is commonly referred to as Bahia although this can cause confusion since Bahia is also the name of the province in which the city was located. In both cases I have tried to be as explicit as possible and I hope that context will aid the perplexed reader.

18 Population estimates for Central Mexico in the sixteenth century are highly controversial. Woodrow Borah and Sherburne F. Cook of the “Berkeley School” have steadily revised their figures upward to their most recent calculation of 25 million people in Central Mexico at the time of conquest. For Mexico City, estimates varied between 100,000-300,000 although no sixteenth-century writer ever estimated less than 100,000. Gibson, Charles, The Aztecs under Spanish Rule (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1964), p. 112Google Scholar, calculates a population of 80,000 in the 1560s. By 1580 there were 3,000 Spanish households in the city. Cf. Borah, and Cook, , The Aboriginal Population of Central Mexico on the Eve of the Spanish Conquest (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1963); The Indian Population of Central Mexico 1531-1610 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960).Google Scholar

25 The pro-Renaissance plan school is best represented by Stanislawski, Dan, “Origin and Plan of the Grid-Pattern Town,” Geographical Review 36 (1946): 105-120Google Scholar; and his article cited above in footnote 22. The opposite approach has an eloquent exponent in George Kubler, “Mexican Urbanism.” McAndrew, Open-Air Churches presents a compromise position. See also the discussion in Palm, Erwin Walter, “Orígenes del urbanismo imperial en América,” Contribuciones a la historia municipal de América (México: Instituto panamericano de geografía e historia, 1951), pp. 241-268Google Scholar; and Kubler's, George more recent exposition “The Unity of Cities in the Americas,” Journal of World History 9, no. 4 (1966): 884-890.Google Scholar

27 Gibson, Aztecs Under Spanish Rule, pp. 352-353, 396; Bernal Diaz del Castillo, companion of Cortés, commented that “some soldiers among us who had been in many parts of the world, in Constantinople and all over Italy, and in Rome, said that they had never seen before so large a market place so full of people, and so well regulated and arranged.” See The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico (London, 1936).

30 The bibliography of the Spanish American municipal councils is extensive. A good although legalistic approach is Constantino Bayle, , Los cabildos seculares en la América española (Madrid: Sapientia, 1952)Google Scholar. The composite volume, Contribuciones a la historia municipal de América contains suggestions and guides for research. The most detailed monograph in English is Moore, Preston, The Cabildo in Peru Under the Hapsburgs (Durham: Duke University Press, 1954)Google Scholar. The basic documents for the study of the cabildo of Mexico are the minutes of the town council or Actas de Cabildo de la Ciudad de México, 15 vols. (México, 1889-1900).

The crafts were family-oriented and each craft had its own patron deity. After the conquest, Indian artisans were encouraged by the crown but were disliked by their Spanish competitors. The Spanish guild system was transferred to Mexico City, apparently in response to Indian competition, but Indians were eventually incorporated into the guilds albeit with marked disabilities.

64 The Portuguese were aware of the Spanish methods and institutions. In 1559 Father Manuel da Nóbrega noted that the colonists in Bahia wanted the Indians distributed “como se fez ñas Antilhas e no Peru.” See Leite, Serafim, ed., Cartas dos primeiros Jesuítas do Brasil, 3 vols. (Coimbra: Comissáo do IV Centenario da Cidade de Sao Paulo, 1956-1958), 1: 92.Google Scholar Such suggestions continued into the seventeenth century in the memorials of Bento Maciel Párente. The conflict between the Jesuits and the colonists became a major theme of Brazilian history. The Jesuits won the controversy and have dominated the historiography as well.

70 The records of the cámara from 1549 to 1625 were destroyed in the Dutch seizure of the city in the latter year.
