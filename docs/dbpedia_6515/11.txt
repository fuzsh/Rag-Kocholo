Net Viewer can be used to manage web URLs, email addresses, usernames, and passwords. Web Page addresses can be easily saved in Net Viewer's database by dragging the address from any browser's address bar to the Web Page table. You can simply drag and drop from the browser's favorites or bookmarks to this program. Importing of all the favorites from web browsers is also possible.
