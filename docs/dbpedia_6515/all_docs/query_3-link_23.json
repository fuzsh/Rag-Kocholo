        "meta_description": "This document is intended for distributors who intend to automate their business with QBS.\n\n# Overview\n\nVersion 1 of the QBS API is structured around REST, HTTP, and JSON. API endpoint URLs are organised around resources, such as orders or products. It uses HTTP methods for indicating the action to take on a resource, and HTTP status codes for expressing error states.\n\n# Base URL\n\nThe API is accessed using a base URL api.qbssoftware.com. In addition, URL paths should begin with /api/v1 to specify version 1 of the API. Generally, the URL will be in the form [https://api.qbssoftware.com/api/v1/](https://api.qbssoftware.com/api/v1/). All API calls should be made over HTTPS.\n\n# Test URL\n\nFor testing purposes, we have created the [https://api-test.qbssoftware.com](https://api-test.qbssoftware.com) endpoint. The same rules apply, as with Base URL, i.e., adding versioning and connecting via HTTPS. You will see this test URL used extensively in any example requests.\n\n# Authentication\n\nAll requests to the API are authenticated by providing your API key. The API key should be provided as an HTTP header named Api-Token.\n\nYour API key can be found in your account on [www.qbssoftware.com](http://www.qbssoftware.com).\n\n# Error Codes\n\nThe API uses HTTP status codes to indicate an error has occurred while processing a request. There are four main error status codes used by the API:\n\n403 - The request could not be authenticated or the authenticated user is not authorized to access the requested resource.\n\n404 - The requested resource does not exist.\n\n422 - The request could not be processed, usually due to a missing or invalid parameter.\n\n429 - The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\") - contact support or account manager for more details.\n\n# Rate limit\n\nOur API has a rate limit of 5 requests per second per account.",
