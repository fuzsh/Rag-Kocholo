        "text": "Publishing Reports to NetViewer\n\nAny i-net Clear Reports standard report or custom report can be published to NetViewer. When publishing reports, only the most recently published report will appear on the NetViewer home page. Thus, if you publish a report for a date in the past, that report will replace the same report in NetViewer, even if the newly published report is not as recent as the previously published report.\n\nReports in NetViewer are fully searchable once the reports have been indexed (a process that parses the report for searchable text). After adding a report to NetViewer, re-index the reports in order to ensure that the new report is searchable. The indexing process may be time intensive depending on the number of reports published to NetViewer. When re-indexing reports in NetViewer, it may take several minutes before search terms can be queried in NetViewer."
