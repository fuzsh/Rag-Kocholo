In the years between national conferences, NetVUE hosts a large virtual event (the NetVUE UnConference), as well as smaller, in-person regional and topical gatherings, which allow for smaller numbers of participants to focus on a specific theme. These events are held in various parts of the country, so that most member institutions will find one or two of these gatherings within a few hours’ drive.\n\nStrengthening Institutional Capacity: NetVUE Grant Programs\n\nNetVUE currently offers five different grant programs, in amounts ranging from $12,000 to over $100,000, that are designed to support programming for students and professional development for faculty members and staff. Grants range in length from one to three years. They are intended to strengthen the capacity of NetVUE member institutions to support and enrich vocational exploration and discernment among undergraduate students. These initiatives are administered by CIC with generous support from Lilly Endowment Inc.\n\nPromoting Knowledge and Networking:\n\nNetVUE Print and Digital Resources\n\nBuilding a Community of Practice: NetVUE Professional Development Opportunities\n\nNetVUE promotes the sharing of knowledge, expertise, and best practices through a number of professional development opportunities, including free consulting services (for specific programs or for the whole campus), subsidized visits of campus teams to another NetVUE institution, support for reading groups (both a “Big Read” for the entire network and a “Collaborative Read” for smaller-scale groups). NetVUE also supports multiple seminars for staff and faculty members, hosting these events at the national level and underwriting their development on member campuses.\n\nMembership in NetVUE\n\n​The Network for Vocation in Undergraduate Education (NetVUE) currently has 308 ​institutional members and 9 organizational members. View a map of NetVUE members. Institutional membership is open to any independent college or university that would be eligible for membership in the Council of Independent Colleges. Organizational Membership is open to any organization that includes NetVUE institutional members among its own members or constituencies.\n\nNetVUE membership operates on a calendar-year basis, with dues payable by December 1 for the following calendar year. Dues for institutional members are based on the college or university’s undergraduate full-time equivalent enrollment. Institutions may join at any time. Those that join in October or later receive membership benefits for the remainder of that year as well as the following calendar year."
