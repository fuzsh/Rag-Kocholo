        "text": "Former William Morris agent Larry M. Kramer has been appointed chief operating officer of Pseudo Programs, Inc., the Internet TV network founded by Web guru Joshua Harris.\n\nKramer, who ankled his post at William Morris three weeks ago, will be charged with stepping up the company’s expansion and business development efforts. He will work to escalate the company’s content and distribution partnerships and to help forge additional strategic alliances.\n\nKramer will report to David Bohrman, Pseudo’s CEO, who joined Pseudo in January after ankling his post as exec VP of CNNfn. “Larry’s deal-making abilities, his substantial relationships in the media and entertainment worlds and his management style make him a wonderful addition,” said Bohrman.\n\nAs an agent at William Morris, Kramer represented news personalities such as CNN’s Stuart Varney. Previously, he was VP of business affairs at PPV net Viewer’s Choice (now In Demand) and director of legal and business affairs at CNBC. Before joining CNBC, he served as associate counsel for Rainbow Programming."
