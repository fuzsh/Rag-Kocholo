        "text": "Network Analysis Visualization (NAV) Meghan Allen and Peter McLachlan December 15, 2004\n\nProblem • Network traffic analysis is necessary for many home and corporate users • Security threats are on the rise on the internet • Users are interested in their bandwidth usage • Analyzing network data is a difficult challenge • Traditional network analysis software only provides detailed text based output • These packages do not provide an overview, or capabilities to pop-out important information • No dynamic filtering, static queries only • Finding specific events can be challenging\n\nEthereal\n\nObjective • Develop a tool for network visualization • Focus on common protocols and services • Focus on log files • Our intention is to provide high level information at-a-glance\n\nRelated work • Visual Information Security Utility for Administration Live (VISUAL) [1] • PortVis [2] • NVisionIP [3] • The Spinning Cube of Potential Doom [4]\n\nSolution • NAV provides two overviews and a detail view • IP wall view displays connections between local and remote machines colour coded by port number • Services view contains a trellis structure of graphs displaying information based on the port number • Users can dynamically filter on time • Users can statically filter on a number of packet level details\n\nIP wall view • Displays connections between local and remote machines • Ability to collapse and aggregate IP address ranges • Allows connection hiding to avoid line snarls • Displays total traffic per address/port pair\n\nService view • Displays a graph for each pre-selected service only if data exists • Graph displays traffic (bytes/s) against time • Log based time axis can be toggled • Service selection is user specified\n\nDetail view • Drag and drop from IP wall view or services view to display detailed packet information • Displays packets for a single IP address or a single port number at a time\n\nEvaluation • Strengths • Good overviews of the information • Quickly shows active services that consume network resources • Weaknesses • Performance/Scalability • Application is not feature complete\n\nReferences [1] R.
