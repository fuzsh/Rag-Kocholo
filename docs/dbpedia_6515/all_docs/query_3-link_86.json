Trying to decide if I can bear the cycle again. Go to sleep, wake up, and go through the motions. Bathe, dress, work, breathe, eat. No love, no touch, no joy, no warmth, no fun, no closeness, no passion, no words of peace, of hope, of beauty, and belonging. No art, no fullness, no accomplishment, no satisfaction, no ties, no sense of wholeness. Fragments. Bits and pieces. Effort. Adversity. Bullshit. Pretense. Shallowness. Hypocrisy. Lies. Greed. Vanity. Pride. Deception. Lust. Waste. Barren. Fruitless. Futile. Empty. Painful. Hourly. Daily. Day to week to month to year. We're all in this alone.

It has no continuity, no sense of logic, the whole page is a freaking non sequitur! I'm not sure how I wound up at this page in the first place, I'm not sure if this guy is just trying to sound like someone he's not to get attention, but the more I think about that, you have to KNOW who you're not to do that in the first place, so it counts. Maybe this page is some huge web joke I've never seen before, and I'm left out. This page needs a \"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?\" button. Or maybe it doesn't maybe that would destroy it all. I have yet to read all of it, but I like the way this guy writes, I like it. I don't know why. It's absent of everything but nonsense. Yet, it's poignent nonsense, so I keep reading. Okay ,this is way long enough.\n\nberck@mindless.com\n\n8/26/97, 9:35 PM\n\nberck\n\nI'm thinking, \"cool\".

I find myself reading more of his accounts of his random thoughts, or perhaps not so random ones. I should be sleeping. Instead I'm reading this stuff. This is what the web is about. This page, it's full of the sort of stuff that you can't find anywhere else except on the web. Well, no you find it every day, you just don't see it expressed. Thanks for giving me something to chuckle about. -Berck\n\nberck@mindless.com\n\n8/26/97, 10:23 PM\n\nnic\n\nI'm thinking that this \"Place O.G.H.\" is \"cool\". Where one can say what they think, or have been thinking about. Yes, it does have nonsense, and \"get wells\", and chuckles, and profundidty, and random thoughts, and lunch lists, etc. Yes, andrea, some connections \"just happen\". Others can't happen if I don't plan to be open to them. Sometimes we aren't open to them. And who said anything about love? Can't people have any friends anymore? Be a friend, have a friend, lose a friend, WIN a friend? Is this a competition? Rats... Somebody should've told me.

Completed insulated and isolated from any harm or damage that you could intend. And yet, with our lives being so completely insignificant to one another, I still find myself hoping that someway, somehow you will all read some witty diatribe that I have scribbled, and think of the \"cool\" guy who just posted for the first time. Meaningless. I have a career a life, and flocks of friends and even admirers, and the last thing I need is the adolation of far-off netviewers. Maybe it's the fact that you know nothing of me other than the innerworkings of my mind through my prose. Maybe I need some sort of intellectual ratification from people that I blindly consider to be in the intellectual elite. Maybe I just need to go home and have a beer, or fire one of my employees, or both. nah... The truth of the matter is that I am a stockbroker who has taken up HTML programming for a web-page, and I suck at it. It is very discouraging, and it really bothers me that I am not excelling at it. I hate to be less than the best, and it is becoming readily apparent that I suck at this...\n\nwheeler@cyberramp.net\n\nhttp://www.cyberramp.net/~wheeler\n\n9/4/97, 0:06 AM\n\nFredescu\n\nEverthing's in it's entirety.
