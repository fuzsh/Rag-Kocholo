        "text": "Tutorial: Access and customize the developer portal\n\nAPPLIES TO: Developer | Basic | Basic v2 | Standard | Standard v2 | Premium\n\nThe developer portal is an automatically generated, fully customizable website with the documentation of your APIs. It is where API consumers can discover your APIs, learn how to use them, and request access.\n\nIn this tutorial, you learn how to:\n\nFor more information about developer portal features and options, see Azure API Management developer portal overview.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nComplete the following quickstart: Create an Azure API Management instance.\n\nImport and publish an API.\n\nAccess the portal as an administrator\n\nFollow these steps to access the managed version of the developer portal.\n\nIn the Azure portal, navigate to your API Management instance.\n\nIf you created your instance in a v2 service tier that supports the developer portal, first enable the developer portal.\n\nIn the left menu, under Developer portal, select Portal settings.\n\nIn the Portal settings window, select Enabled. Select Save.\n\nIt might take a few minutes to enable the developer portal.\n\nIn the left menu, under Developer portal, select Portal overview. Then select the Developer portal button in the top navigation bar. A new browser tab with an administrative version of the portal will open.\n\nUnderstand the portal's administrative interface\n\nAs an administrator, you can customize the content of the portal using the visual editor.\n\nUse the menu options on the left to create or modify pages, media, layouts, menus, styles, or website settings.\n\nOn the top, switch between viewports (for screens of different sizes), or view the elements of the portal visible to users in different groups. For example, you might want to display certain pages only to groups that are associated with particular products, or to users that can access specific APIs.\n\nAlso, save or undo changes you make, or publish the website.\n\nAdd an image to the media library\n\nYou'll want to use your own images and other media content in the developer portal to reflect your organization's branding. If an image that you want to use isn't already in the portal's media library, add it in the developer portal:\n\nIn the left menu of the visual editor, select Media.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nSelect Upload file and select a local image file on your computer.\n\nSelect Link file. Enter a Reference URL to the image file and other details. Then select Download.\n\nSelect Close to exit the media library.\n\nTip\n\nYou can also add an image to the media library by dragging and dropping it directly in the visual editor window.\n\nReplace the default logo on the home page\n\nA placeholder logo is provided in the top left corner of the navigation bar. You can replace it with your own logo to match your organization's branding.\n\nIn the developer portal, select the default Contoso logo in the top left of the navigation bar.\n\nSelect Edit.\n\nIn the Picture pop-up, under Main, select Source.\n\nIn the Media pop-up, select one of the following:\n\nAn image already uploaded in your media library\n\nUpload file to upload a new image file to your media library\n\nNone if you don't want to use a logo\n\nThe logo updates in real time.\n\nSelect outside the pop-up windows to exit the media library.\n\nIn the top bar, select Save.\n\nEdit content on the home page\n\nThe default Home page and other pages are provided with placeholder text and other images. You can either remove entire sections containing this content or keep the structure and adjust the elements one by one. Replace the generated text and images with your own and make sure any links point to desired locations.\n\nEdit the structure and content of the generated pages in several ways. For example:\n\nSelect existing text and heading elements to edit and format content.\n\nAdd a section to a page by hovering over a blank area then click a blue icon with a plus sign. Choose from among several section layouts.\n\nAdd a widget (for example, text, image, custom widget, or APIs list) by hovering over a blank area, then click a gray icon with a plus sign.\n\nRearrange items in a page by drag-and-drop.\n\nEdit the site's primary color\n\nTo change colors, gradients, typography, buttons, and other user interface elements in the developer portal, edit the site styles. For example, change the primary color used in the navigation bar, buttons, and other elements to match your organization's branding.\n\nIn the developer portal, in the left menu of the visual editor, select Styles.\n\nUnder the Colors section, select the color style item you want to edit. For example, select Primary.\n\nSelect Edit color.\n\nSelect the color from the color-picker, or enter the color hex code.\n\nIn the top bar, elect Save.\n\nThe updated color is applied to the site in real time.\n\nChange the background image on the home page\n\nYou can change the background on your portal's home page to an image or color that matches your organization's branding. If you haven't already uploaded a different image to the media library, you can upload it before changing the background image, or when you're changing it.\n\nOn the home page of the developer portal, click in the top right corner so that the top section is highlighted at the corners and a pop-up menu appears.\n\nTo the right of Edit article in the pop-up menu, select the up-down arrow (Switch to parent).\n\nSelect Edit section.\n\nIn the Section pop-up, under Background, select one of the icons:\n\nClear background, to remove a background image\n\nBackground image, to select an image from the media library, or to upload a new image\n\nBackground color, to select a color from the color picker, or to clear a color\n\nBackground gradient, to select a gradient from your site styles page, or to clear a gradient\n\nUnder Background sizing, make a selection appropriate for your background.\n\nIn the top bar, select Save.\n\nChange the default layout\n\nThe developer portal uses layouts to define common content elements such as navigation bars and footers on groups of related pages. Each page is automatically matched with a layout based on a URL template.\n\nBy default, the developer portal comes with two layouts:\n\nHome - used for the home page (URL template /)\n\nDefault - used for all other pages (URL template /*).\n\nYou can change the layout for any page in the developer portal and define new layouts to apply to pages that match other URL templates.\n\nFor example, to change the logo that's used in the navigation bar of the Default layout to match your organization's branding:\n\nIn the left menu of the visual editor, select Pages.\n\nSelect the Layouts tab, and select Default.\n\nSelect the picture of the logo in the upper left corner and select Edit.\n\nUnder Main, select Source.\n\nIn the Media pop-up windows, select one of the following:\n\nAn image already uploaded in your media library\n\nUpload file to upload a new image file to your media file that you can select\n\nNone if you don't want to use a logo\n\nThe logo updates in real time.\n\nSelect outside the pop-up windows to exit the media library.\n\nIn the top bar, select Save.\n\nEdit navigation menus\n\nYou can edit the navigation menus at the top of the developer portal pages to change the order of menu items, add items, or remove items. You can also change the name of menu items and the URL or other content they point to.\n\nFor example, the Default and Home layouts for the developer portal display two menus to guest users of the developer portal:\n\na main menu with links to Home, APIs, and Products\n\nan anonymous user menu with links to Sign in and Sign up pages.\n\nHowever, you might want to customize them. For example, if you want to independently invite users to your site, you could disable the Sign up link in the anonymous user menu.\n\nIn the left menu of the visual editor, select Site menu.\n\nOn the left, expand Anonymous user menu.\n\nSelect the settings (gear icon) next to Sign up, and select Delete.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nEdit site settings\n\nEdit the site settings for the developer portal to change the site name, description, and other details.\n\nIn the left menu of the visual editor, select Settings.\n\nIn the Settings pop-up, enter the site metadata you want to change. Optionally, set up a favicon for the site from an image in your media library.\n\nIn the top bar, Save.\n\nPublish the portal\n\nTo make your portal and its latest changes available to visitors, you need to publish it.\n\nTo publish from the administrative interface of the developer portal:\n\nMake sure you saved your changes by selecting the Save button.\n\nIn the menu at the top, select Publish site. This operation may take a few minutes.\n\nVisit the published portal\n\nTo view your changes after you publish the portal, access it at the same URL as the administrative panel, for example https://contoso-api.developer.azure-api.net. View it in a separate browser session (using incognito or private browsing mode) as an external visitor.\n\nApply the CORS policy on APIs\n\nTo let the visitors of your portal test the APIs through the built-in interactive console, enable CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) on your APIs, if you haven't already done so. On the Portal overview page of your API Management instance in the Azure portal, select Enable CORS.
