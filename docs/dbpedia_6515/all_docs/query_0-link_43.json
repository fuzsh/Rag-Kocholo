        "text": "I accidentally came across a strange fix: outputting a string (other than space) on the form load event subsequently allows the viewer to render correctly in IE10\n\nDim vBrowser As System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilities = Request.Browser If vBrowser.Type = \"IE10\" And vBrowser.MajorVersion > 9 Then Response.Write(\".\") End If\n\nI am using the CR XI ActiveX viewer control under classic asp. I discovered that my reports were coming up blank under IE 10. Using compatibility mode allowed the reports to work correctly. The problem was that IE 10 is apparently more picky about 'assumed' sub names for dom events such as the window_onload event in the SmartViewerActiveX.asp page that I, and probably many other people, use. In the original file from SAP, the sub is written as Window_Onload. (note the capitalization) There are two ways to fix this: add this text onload=\"Window_Onload;\" to the body, or simply drop the capital letters in the original sub name. Hope this helps."
