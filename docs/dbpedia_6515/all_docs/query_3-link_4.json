        "text": "German IT company\n\nNetviewer AG was a German IT company headquartered in Karlsruhe. The company's software products provided web conferencing, desktop sharing, and remote maintenance capabilities. As of 2009, the firm employed more than 200 people at nine locations in Europe and served more than 15,000 corporate customers in 55 countries.[citation needed]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNetviewer was founded in 2001. In 2002, the firm won a competition for startup companies sponsored by German savings banks and McKinsey Consulting in Germany. In 2006 and 2007, it ranked in the top 10 of the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 in Germany.[citation needed] In 2007 and 2008, according to market research companies Frost & Sullivan[1] and Gartner,[2] Netviewer was among the leading European providers of web conferencing software. Since 2011, Netviewer has been part of Citrix Online, a division of Citrix Systems, Inc.[3]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main functionality of Netviewer products was desktop sharing between two or more computers over the Internet and allowing the exchange of screen contents. The firm's products include web conferencing Netviewer Meets; help desk and IT support software, Netviewer Support; a remote access tool, Netviewer Admin; and the web-based webinar and webcast Netviewer Present.[citation needed]\n\nNetviewer Meet was available as freeware for private users and as software-as-a-service or on-premises licensing models for commercial use. The other products are available as software-as-a service or on-premises licenses exclusively.\n\nAfter the acquisition of Netviewer, two different products, GoToMeeting for web conferencing and GoToAssist for remote access, were released. No free versions were available; only trial versions.[4]\n\nSecurity\n\n[edit]\n\nNetviewer products use 256-bit AES encryption and key-phrase-based authentication, and the software's security has been certified by Fraunhofer in an expert opinion.[5] The SIT opinion, which is dated April 2004, specifically pertains to Netviewer 2.0 (build 521).\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nGoTo (US company) â€“ currently company with the legacy of these products\n\nWeb conferencing\n\nComparison of web conferencing software\n\nCollaborative software\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
