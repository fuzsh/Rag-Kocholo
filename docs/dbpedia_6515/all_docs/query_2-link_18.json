But all the techniques or tools that they use still heavily rely on human detection. In this paper a visual interactive network connection system called NetViewer is designed in 3D view for representing traffic activities that reside in network flows and their patterns. The experiments show that NetViewer can not only monitor all the activities in the network, but also detect DDoS attacks, network scans and port scans etc.",
