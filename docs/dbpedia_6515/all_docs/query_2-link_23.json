The no-new-revenue tax rate would Impose the same amount of taxes as last year if you compare properties taxed in both years. The voter-approval tax rate is the highest tax rate a taxing unit can adopt without holding an election. In each case, these rates are calculated by dividing the total amount of taxes by the current taxable value with adjustments as required by state law. The rates are given per $100 of property value.
