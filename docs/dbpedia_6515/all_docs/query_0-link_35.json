I am not 100% sure of the exact model as it is not displayed on the Dvr.\n\nAlthough this Dvr may be a little dated it still works well and is adequate for my needs. However on my old pc i had the Net Viewer software which allowed me to remote view the cameras using the Swann DDNS service.\n\nI now have a new pc but have lost the CD with the NetView software. Looking on the net i have found a download for the software from the Swann website but i cannot connect and get the message \"login failed\" even though my details are correct.\n\nAre there different versions of NetViewer? Is there an alternative or better viewing software that i can use to remote view?\n\nAny advice please?\n\ni have found a download for the software from the Swann website but i cannot connect and get the message \"login failed\"\n\nThis link seems to work OK, no logon needed: http://swann.com/downloads/drivers/DVR_2600/\n\nThough I'm not sure if it's what you are looking for. There are various versions of NetViewer listed."
