The cause seems to have been derangement of the mind, which her near friends had known for some time, but kept it secret in the hope that she would soon recover.\n\nHad the lady with whom she lived been apprised of their fears, this sad calamity might not have happened. She seemed very despondent this winter, and repeatedly said she would take poison to get out of this unfriendly world, but all supposed she was joking.\n\nOn Monday, the 12th inst. she went to Oswego on the passenger train, walked from the depot directly to a drug store, procured the fatal drug and returned home on the freight train. It is said she was not in Oswego more than ten minutes. On Wednesday afternoon, as Mrs. Hoffman, the lady with whom she was staying, was preparing to take a drive, Maggie said to her, \"What would you think to come home and find me dead.\" Mrs. H. did not think she was in earnest. After she had gone Maggie gathered all her clothes together, folded and laid them nicely away in her trunk, locked it and it is supposed then swallowed the deadly draught. She then went out for a walk, going about ninety rods, and meeting several on the road smiled and spoke pleasantly to them. She called at the post office, inquired for her mail and deposited a note. From there she went to her father's house, told them she had taken poison, that no one was to blame, and it was too late to get a doctor as she would soon be gone, and in about five minutes she died. Miss Maggie Bowman had been in our midst for over a year, and in all that time we have never seen anything but lady-like deportment from her. She was a very sensitive, proud spirited girl, and if her position in life had been a more exalted one, she would never have had cause to imagine, or worry herself into such a condition. She was a pure virtuous girl, and her many friends regret her untimely end. Her father and sister Mrs. Julia James have the sympathy of all. She was a cousin of Mrs. William Sanford of Oswego. -- Mrs. Jane Houston, Altamont, Kans., Mar. 20, 1883 (Oswego Independent, Friday, March 23, 1883, Page 3)\n\nBOWMAN, MARGUERITE ELLEN\n\nMarguerite Ellen Bowman, 83, of Oswego, died early Monday morning (February 21, 1994) in the Oswego Guest Home after a lengthy illness.\n\nShe was born March 18, 1910, in Kincaid to Arthur and Fannie (Propeck) Hearson.

Four weeks ago Bruckman gave the girl a terrible beating, because she did not work to suit him in his cornfield. He then tied a rope around one of her ankles, fastened the other end of the rope to a rear axle of his wagon and drove to his barn a quarter of a mile off, dragging the girl behind. Arriving there, he locked her up in the barn without sufficient clothing and without food.\n\nThe girl was found by her uncle and another neighbor, who carried her away, but her injuries were so serious that she died on November 22.\n\nBruckman has long been an outcast among the farmers of Osage township. His ranch adjoins the notorious Bender farm and he was the nearest neighbor of the Bender butchers.\n\nAfter the horrifying crimes of the Bender family had become known and they had fled the country, Bruckman was visited one night by a mob of masked men who demanded to know where the Benders had gone. Bruckman insisted that he knew nothing of the Benders or their deeds, but he was strung up to the limb of a tree and held there until almost dead. Finally, however, he was cut down and allowed to go away, but ever since he has been shunned.
