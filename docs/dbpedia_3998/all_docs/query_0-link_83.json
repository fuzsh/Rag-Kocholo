He was a member of the U.S. Veterinary training school. But for an injury to his knee in August last, he would have had his chance overseas. The injury was slow to mend, however, and it kept him from leaving with his contingent. Horses said Mahnke, are a drug on the market in the east now. I saw whole bunches of them being sold for as little as $65 each at Camp Lee last week. The government has no further use for either horses or mules and they are being sacrificed to get rid of them. I saw several horses in good condition sold for $25 each. Manitowoc Herald News, Thursday, February 20, 1919 Page 6 (Note: This article was about more than one soldier/it has been split and the other parts are put with the relevant soldier) ******** Leo Mahnke, son of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Mahnke and Miss Hilda Stoer of the Town of Two Rivers were married on May 1 at the St. John's parsonage.
