        "text": "Honoring Two Remarkable Friends of Catholic Charities\n\nThis month, we wish to honor and commemorate the lives of two extraordinary friends of Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas: Richard Gerber Sr. and Tom Lytle.\n\nRichard Gerber Sr.\n\nRichard Gerber Sr., who passed away at the age of 104, was a cherished friend and a significant donor to Catholic Charities. His enduring legacy of generosity and service is reflected in his family; his daughter, Patty Dunkle, serves as a board member, and several of his other children are significant friends and donors of our agency as well. Richard’s life was a testament to hard work, dedication, and community service. Whether through his military service during World War II, his entrepreneurial spirit in running Rixon Oil Company, or his volunteer efforts in retirement, Richard exemplified the values of dignity, respect, and collaboration. His contributions have empowered countless individuals and families, and his spirit of giving continues to inspire us all.\n\nTom Lytle\n\nTom Lytle’s legacy at Catholic Charities is one of dedication and unwavering support, particularly through his loving partnership with his wife, Shirley Lytle. Shirley, a long-time former staff member, initiated our Adoption Search and Reunion Program and the Charity Wine Tasting Event, and she was involved in the initial capital campaign that became our Endowment Fund, Endowment for the Future. Tom's support was evident through his active participation in our events, attending alongside Shirley, and contributing generously to our cause. The Lytles graciously donated their Colorado cabin for a week-long vacation as part of our wine tasting auction every year, a gesture that significantly bolstered our fundraising efforts. Tom’s steadfast support, both in presence and contribution, exemplified the importance of spousal support in fostering the mission of Catholic Charities. His easy-going nature and passion for family gatherings, especially at their home in Woodland Park, Colorado, are fondly remembered by all who knew him.\n\nBoth Richard and Tom embodied the mission and values of Catholic Charities through their service, advocacy, and dedication to creating positive change. Their memories will live on in the lives they touched and the hope they instilled in our community. It is a testament to their enduring legacy that both families have designated memorials to Catholic Charities, continuing the legacy of compassion and support that both men so passionately upheld.\n\nWe extend our deepest condolences to the families of Richard Gerber Sr. and Tom Lytle. Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let the perpetual light shine upon them. May their souls and all the souls of the faithfully departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.\n\nA Legacy of Love and Accompaniment: Remembering the Life and Contributions of Levita Rohlman\n\nIt is with deep sadness and a profound sense of loss that we announce the sudden passing of our coworker, Levita Rohlman. Few things measure up to the valuable roles she played both in our agency and the lives of the many individuals she served throughout her illustrious career.\n\nEmbarking on her journey with Catholic Social Service in 1975, Levita played an essential role in establishing our Garden City office. Over the years, she became an indispensable source of wisdom, information, and expertise, touching countless lives through her work in Migration and Refugee Services.\n\nLevita's compassionate service was characterized by her unwavering mission to provide new beginnings for those friends and neighbors who sought solace in our community, escaping the horrors of war-torn homes for the hope of peace and prosperity.\n\nHer legacy is intricately woven into the tapestry of our very history, as she championed the accommodation of the vulnerable and the displaced, from the wave of Southeast Asians in the 70s to countless other refugees from around the globe over the years. Under her guidance, southwestern Kansas not only became home but also community for these \"strangers.\"\n\nWhen we remember Levita, we recall her support in transitioning refugees to their new life, her dedication in negotiating the complex immigration system, and her tireless efforts in advocating for those who found a haven in southwest Kansas. In every action, she radiated with unwavering faith, patience, empathy, and justice. Every refugee she served experienced her \"Faith-In-Action.\" Her loving presence was a beacon of hope, guiding newcomers to a home filled with opportunities, kindness, and acceptance.\n\nFollowing our reunification with the Catholic Agency for Migration and Refugee Services in 2019, Levita shared her deep and extensive expertise to ensure we could continue to offer critical Legal Immigration Services. Her hand steadily guided us through this transition, and she leaves behind an indelible mark and a solid foundation on which we continue to build.\n\nLosing Levita has left a void that can never truly be filled. But as we move forward, we draw strength and inspiration from her legacy of love, passion for justice, the deep sense of humanity she embodied, and the countless lives she touched. Far more than a colleague, Levita was a mentor, an advocate, and a friend. We miss her greatly.\n\nKeep checking back as we will share funeral details as we know of them. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Levita's family and friends during this time and we keep them in our prayers.\n\nFatherhood Doesn't Live in a Box\n\nDetails\n\nThursday, 27 May 2021\n\nBy Rebecca Ford\n\nI’ve been thinking about Father’s Day. Naturally, it’s on a lot of minds this month.\n\nOn one hand, it’s an important holiday for Catholic Charities because we value families, fathers, and fatherhood. We talk amongst ourselves about how to include and serve fathers better—birth fathers, adoptive fathers, fathers in prison, fathers getting out of prison, fathers who are struggling to support their family, fathers overcoming addiction, fathers who are struggling to pay child support, immigrant and refugee fathers and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, I am thinking about Father’s Day on a more personal level. Positive or negative, who among us doesn’t have some kind of experience of fatherhood. Without fathers, we would not exist! But I also posit, fatherhood hardly depends on fathers alone.\n\nLike quite a few others, this coming Father’s Day will be the first one without my Dad who lost his battle to COVID-19 in September. Some days, it still seems surreal. I remember thinking that he was safe, quarantined as he was along with all of the others in the retirement community. When he did come down with the virus, he rallied back so many times that I was not prepared when his health very quickly went downhill for good. He was ready; I was not.\n\nOne of my earliest, favorite memories of my dad is a fishing trip with him and one of his military buddies. In hindsight, one would hardly think that this would be a positive experience for a two or three-year-old: it was a dreary, cold day and I remember bugging them for milk. We also got hopelessly stuck in the mud and had to walk quite a ways out from that Idaho reservoir for help. But more than any of that, I remember the warm, safe, special feeling associated with the fact that he brought me along and I was with him.\n\nMy dad was not one to talk much about his feelings. He expressed his feelings through his hands and through that, instilled in me an appreciation for fine craftsmanship, particularly his woodwork, but also his ability to fix or build anything. I think of him often when I need something fixed around my house!\n\nNo doubt, becoming a dad and the thought of shaping another human being is an awesome and potentially frightening responsibility. Joey Bahr, a father of three, writes:\n\nOn a shelf in my home office sits a baseball. It is my first Father's Day gift from six years ago.\n\nWhen I got it, my first son was still in the hospital after being born three months early. Now he is six and has two brothers, aged four and two.\n\nThere were times at the hospital that I doubted what kind of father I could be. When it came time to take him home, it hit like a ton of bricks.\n\nNo more safety net. A hard shove into the deep end.\n\nI've learned a lot over these years. As our family grew, so did the differences from child to child. One that is soft-spoken but ornery, one that is a chatterbox, and one that is, well, his nickname is \"The Destroyer.\"\n\nNo matter what a shirt or coffee mug might say, I know I won't be the best Dad in the world. I work to be the best for my family.\n\nIt will take time, sacrifices, and lots of patience. When one of my boys comes running to hug me, all of the work is worth it.\n\nThe prospect of fatherhood might be easier when we consider the adage: “It takes a village to raise a child.” For example, it’s impossible for me to think of Father’s Day without thinking about all of the other male figures who have also shaped and influenced me. My uncle impressed me with his quiet strength and attentiveness. A family friend and employer provided guidance when I needed to make a tough decision. A college professor taught, in class and by example, how to be a phenomenal listener. A priest showed by example how to be hardworking, devout, humble, service-minded, and incredibly thoughtful of others. I’m not saying that I do any of these things well even though I observed and admired these traits in them. But, to some degree or another, all of these men, along with my dad, expressed an impressionable facet of that Divine fatherhood that shapes and guides all of our human family.\n\nWho better illustrates a facet of that Divine fatherhood than our fathers who have stepped up to adopt and parent a child, and twins, no less!\n\nJeremy Owings writes:\n\nAs I look back and reflect on the last two years of being a father, I realize fatherhood is way more than just keeping the lights on. Having adopted twins, I was so fortunate to be able to develop a close bond with both my boys as babies. Many dads don’t get to experience regular feedings and I am so grateful I was able to show them my nurturing side, although I wasn’t full of enthusiasm at 3 am.\n\nAs they’ve grown, I think more about their development and being supportive of their interests. I often imagine what kind of men they will be. I realize the main things I want them to have as adults is a strong sense of self and to live by their values. For me, that means teaching them where they came from, being affectionate, supportive, and living by my values as an example. Although I fall short many days, I hope they see that I am always there for them and there is nothing they can do that will make me stop loving them.\n\nAnd another dad writes of his adopted girl:\n\nFatherhood for me has been the best thing that has happened. Being able to watch her grow, learn and find her personality has been rewarding. She has changed my outlook in life and has made it meaningful. I love being able to teach her things and watch her figure things out on her own. Faith has always been there for me growing up and to this day when I strive to make the right decisions in life. I want her to be able to have the same belief that God will always be there no matter what life throws at you. He is always there when you need someone to turn to.\n\nA couple of pointers for girl dads out there:\n\n1. She will melt your heart and it's okay to give in.\n\n2. You can't fix everything even though you will try. When she sick . . . it's one of the worst feelings.\n\n3. It's okay to show and share your emotions with her; she will understand and it's okay to talk about them. We (men) are not as strong as we strive to be. She watches you when you're not looking so do what is right.\n\n4. Hold and play with her as much as you can because one day she will be too old and not want to. Snuggle and take naps...one of the best feelings.\n\n5. Let her fall and get dirty. Be there when she does.\n\n6. Enjoy every minute because time does not stand still even though you want it to.\n\n7. Spend one-on-one time every day even if you're busy . . . lets momma have time for herself.\n\n8. Be patient . . . and enjoy every second.\n\nNewborns are the fun quiet times even though they don't feel like it; toddlers are chaos but rewarding and one of the best times. Teens....well, please pray for me . . . LOL.\n\nThe notion that fatherhood doesn’t live in a box and doesn’t depend on just one person can be a hopeful message and a call to action for all of us. As a father, you are not alone and you don't have to go it alone. As a child, there are many good men—father figures along the way—who will care and provide positive guidance, as long as you are open to looking for it. And for all men, your mentorship and positive guidance are absolutely needed, by someone, no matter what path you pursue in life.\n\nNew Catholic Charities Office in Liberal Kansas\n\nWe are excited to announce that on April 6th, we are opening a new Catholic Charities office in Liberal, Kansas! The office is located in St Anthony's Catholic School, 1510 N. Calhoun Ave. Appointments will be taken for the first Tuesday of each month and expand to twice a month in July. Case managers will meet with individuals to assess needs and provide COVID-relief, emergency assistance, housing, employment assistance, pregnancy support, refugee services, counseling and more. Individuals should call 620-277-9588 to schedule an appointment at the Catholic Charities Office in Liberal Kansas.\n\nCatholic Charities Office in Liberal Kansas is Overdue\n\n\"This has been something that has been on our mind for years!\" said Debbie Snapp, Executive Director of Catholic Charities. \"Liberal is an important community in our service area. As some of our programs have grown, it's created an opportunity for us to take those programs to Liberal and Seward County as well. This physical presence will help us be more available to more of the smaller communities in the area.\"\n\nAmy Falcon, Director of Behavioral Health Services, agreed: \"We've needed and wanted an office in Liberal for a very long time. It's a part of our area that we don't get to very often. Once people know that we're there, I think it's going to get busy.\"\n\nCall to Schedule an Appointment\n\nAlready, case managers have appointments to meet with clients for pregnancy support and housing needs. \"We'll be able to do everything that we do in our other offices, said Marci Smith, Director of Family Services. Smith is coordinating activities for the Liberal office. \"Each case manager will also be doing some outreach but it'll look different depending on their area of expertise. Our goal is to reach out to all the different organizations in the Liberal and Seward County area.\"\n\nCase managers will be in and out of the office while they are reaching out to the community. Thus, it is important for individuals who need assistance to call 620-277-9588 to set an appointment.\n\n\"I'm very happy that we're going to have this opportunity to have an office in Liberal,\" said Snapp. \"There are needs everywhere and nobody should be left out of that opportunity to get assistance when they need it.\"\n\nAbout Catholic Charities: Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas honors human potential through service, advocacy and invitation in the spirit of the Gospel so that every person experiences hope and fulfillment.

Catholic Charities has served people of all faiths in the 28 counties of southwest Kansas since 1965.\n\nPediatricians are Open to Care for Children\n\nLenexa, KS – The Kansas Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics (KAAP) is encouraging families to maintain routine pediatric appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. In-person, routine well-child visits are still recommended for all children at this time.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics released guidance on May 8, 2020, that encouraged the continuation of well-child care stating “The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports the continued provision of health care for children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, well-child care should be provided consistent with the Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents (4th Edition) and the corresponding Bright Futures/AAP Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care(Periodicity Schedule).”\n\n“We worry about the health effects for children that do not have their scheduled well checks and immunizations during this pandemic,” said Lisa Gilmer, MD, FAAP. “During those exams, we screen for depression and anxiety in adolescents, follow up on asthma and allergies, and provide additional important preventative care that keeps kids healthy.”\n\nWhile many non-essential procedures, surgeries, and visits were postponed in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials made it clear that those decisions were made to preserve personal protective equipment for health care professionals, not because hospitals or doctor’s offices are unsafe places to visit. Pediatric practices in Kansas have adjusted their operations, putting new policies in place to keep patients and families safe during office visits. Families should call their pediatrician to inquire about what their practice is doing during this time to accommodate well visits, vaccinations, and visits for other concerns.\n\nData released from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) showed a significant drop in the amount of vaccines ordered by physicians and other medical providers in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Overall, there was a decrease of 21,143 vaccine orders submitted to the state for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program in April 2020 compared to 2019, which is a 56 percent drop.\n\nWith the drop in well-child visits and immunizations the Kansas Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics (KAAP) is concerned about secondary outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses.\n\nThis summer offers an opportunity to catch up on the well-check visits and vaccinations that were missed this past spring. Every possible effort should be made by families and primary care providers to get children back up to date. Our state herd immunity is fragile, and it is important that physicians and families work together to make sure all Kansas children are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases especially during this unprecedented time. We must take this time now to urgently prioritize well-check visits this summer so Kansas children will be in the safest and healthiest position for the 2020-21 flu/winter season. Even during this time of uncertainty KAAP is hopeful we can work together, innovate, and do what is right to take care of Kansas kids.\n\n###\n\nThe Kansas Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics is a membership organization including about 90% of the pediatricians in the state with a mission of the attainment by all infants, children, adolescents, and young adults of their full potential for physical, mental, emotional, and social health. Together with those who share this purpose, the Kansas Chapter pledges its efforts and expertise to a fundamental goal-that all children and youth have the opportunity to grow up safe and strong, with faith in the future and in themselves.\n\nMeet Claire Albert!\n\nIn January, Claire Albert began working with Catholic Charities as part of her semester-long practicum experience that she needs to complete in order to finish her Bachelor's degree in social work in May. During her time with Catholic Charities, Claire will be working with women who are pregnant, teen moms, and adoptive families. She will also have an opportunity to work with some of the individuals and families in our housing program and assist with our Problem Gambling Task Force and the work we are doing to strengthen our capacity to support those in need during disasters.\n\nWe recently had a chance to ask Claire a few questions, and this is what she had to say:\n\nWhat gets you out of bed in the morning?\n\nOther than my kids, the cat, and coffee, I have an enthusiasm for helping others to live their best life. Knowing I can help by listening, providing education, or helping others build skills to create a better life for themselves motivates me through the day.\n\nWhat is your biggest achievement to date--personal or professional?\n\nMy biggest personal achievement to date is raising three children who are kind. They are all intelligent individuals, and my proudest moments have been when a teacher or classmate tells me how one of them has treated others with compassion and kindness.\n\nI also consider going back to school as a non-traditional student to be a huge blessing, in addition to being a personal and professional achievement.\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for you and what are you currently working on?\n\nA typical day for me right now is coming to Catholic Charities where I practice, and I am mentored in the art and science of Social Work. Outside of working hours, I will be found doing homework in order to complete my degree and graduate this May. Each day for enjoyment I spend as much time with my family and friends as I can.\n\nWhat is on your wish list during your time here or for your next five years?\n\nIn the next five years I plan to complete my Bachelor's degree in Social Work from Fort Hays State University, my Master's degree in Social Welfare from KU, and complete my clinical hours in order to become a licensed clinical social worker so I can provide therapy services.\n\nWhat do you like most about your practicum experience?\n\nThe best thing about my practicum time is getting to come to work with some of the nicest and most genuine women I have ever met! They have been patient teachers and encouragers as I navigate my practicum experience with Catholic Charities.\n\nWhat is your motto or personal mantra?\n\nA wise woman once told me, “Do the right things for the right reasons.” Over the years I have made this my personal mantra.\n\nGiven a chance, who would you like to be for a day?\n\nI don’t think I would want to be anyone else for the day because I don’t think I would be very good at it!\n\nWhat is your guilty pleasure?\n\nMy guilty pleasure is sleeping in on Saturday morning! It is nice to catch up on some rest after a busy week!\n\nMeet Kate Schieferecke!\n\nKate Schieferecke is a Refugee Resettlement Case Manager based in the Dodge City office. Her focus is on supporting refugee resettlement services provided by the agency. She will graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Kansas State University in May of 2019. Kate is additionally working towards her Accredited Financial Counselor certification through the Association for Financial Counseling & Planning Education. Kate first joined Catholic Charities as a volunteer in the Garden City office during the summer of 2018. Kate is working part-time, remotely, leading up to graduation and will begin working full-time in June 2019. We recently had a chance to ask her a few questions, and here is what she had to say:\n\nWhat gets you out of bed in the morning?\n\nMy passion is working with people. Knowing that there will always be people to meet, greet, and converse with is what makes me excited to start each day.\n\nWhat is your biggest achievement to date - personal or professional?\n\nI have studied Spanish throughout college, and I consider my biggest achievement to date to be living and teaching primary ESL classes in Paraguay for 2 months. Teaching several classes a day and speaking conversationally with my host family in Spanish was challenging and rewarding!\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for you and what are you currently working on?\n\nI don’t graduate from K-State until May, so currently, my days consist of going to classes and working as a peer financial counselor at K-State. Stay tuned—I’m looking forward to diving into my work with Catholic Charities beginning in June and seeing what a typical day will look like.\n\nWhat is on your wish list during your time here or for your next five years here?\n\nIn my first five years with Catholic Charities I hope to contribute to and enhance our refugee resettlement services through community outreach and development of resources for those we serve.\n\nWhat do you like most about your job?\n\nI have really enjoyed the positive and supportive work culture present in our staff. Personally, I like that this job allows me to pursue my passion of working with international social issues while being in a location that is close to home.\n\nWhat is your motto or personal mantra?\n\nSaint Teresa of Calcutta is a role model of mine, and my favorite quote of hers is “Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home.”\n\nGiven a chance, who would you like to be for a day?\n\nI would love to be a park ranger in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nWhat is your guilty pleasure?\n\nListening to podcasts with hosts that have Australian accents.\n\n2018 Annual Appeal\n\nAs I sit down to appeal to you for funding for our agency this year, I am mindful of the weary push and pull of emotions and contentiousness that has consumed the news and airwaves for most of this past year. In spite of all of the noise, a few themes emerge:\n\nLove for family and the desire for our children and grandchildren to be safe, happy, and free to pursue dreams and ambitions is the same driving force that moves some to build walls, and others to climb over walls.\n\nOur desire for strong communities and self-sufficient individuals and families is the same driving force that moves some to call for tougher work requirements for those needing assistance, while others call for systemic change to remove barriers that keep people down.\n\nOur desire for a just world is the same driving force that moves some to advocate for less government control while others advocate for more government safe-guards to protect the most vulnerable.\n\nAt Catholic Charities, we are so keenly aware of the struggle. The issues that keep people and communities from being their best are complex. We know that lasting change does not happen with bandaids and quick-fix approaches, but with the daily, committed, compassionate, in-the-trenches work with those in need.\n\nSome of the people we work with are indeed challenged to make life-style changes and better choices. Others need instruction because they simply do not know what they do not know. And still others—perhaps our senior neighbor or the little girl next door—have been treated unfairly and they need a voice that is louder than their own.\n\nSometimes, we provide intensive case management so that a homeless mother achieves permanent housing and better income. Sometimes, we spend months providing one-on-one counseling so that an individual can cope a little better with the struggles and anxieties of life; or so that a teen mom can make the difficult decision about whether to parent her child or to create an adoption plan; or so that an addict can face his or her demons and make amends with family, friends and co-workers. Sometimes, we teach classes about financial literacy, managing a home, nurturing a child, or adopting a child.\n\nThis is the kind of work we do at Catholic Charities, day in and day out. Regardless of the struggles swirling around us, we strive to get to the heart of the matter: Honoring human potential through service, advocacy and invitation, in the spirit of the Gospel, so that every person experiences hope and fulfillment.\n\nToday, as we do every year at this time, I write to ask you to support this work with a prayerfully generous financial gift.\n\nYour gift helps us to stay focused on the persistent, hopeful, in-the-trenches work that makes a lasting impact in the lives of people and families who need help---the kind of impact that leads to strong communities, self-sufficient individuals and families, and a just world. May God bless you for your generosity.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDebbie Snapp\n\nExecutive Director\n\nLIRS and USCCB Release Report on Serving Separated and Reunited Families\n\nLessons Learned and the Way Forward to Promote Family Unity\n\nWashington, D.C.—Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS) and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office of Migration and Refugee Services (USCCB/MRS) released a report today entitled Serving Separated and Reunited Families: Lessons Learned and the Way Forward to Promote Family Unity. The report documents the work of Lutheran and Catholic agencies who assisted the Administration with reuniting separated families during the month of July and provides recommendations for a more humane way forward.\n\n“I am tremendously proud of how quickly LIRS, USCCB/MRS, and our Lutheran and Catholic partners nationwide, stepped up to provide support for families during this time of crisis,” said Kay Bellor, Vice President of Programs for LIRS. “As we have been for decades, communities of faith were there, poised and ready, to love and serve our neighbors in need. It is our deep hope that the lessons learned from this time in our history will prevent the cruel separation of children from their parents from happening again.” In July 2018, LIRS and USCCB/MRS assisted over 1200 families who were reunified after being separated under the Administration’s “Zero Tolerance” policy. The report highlights the work that was undertaken by Lutheran and Catholic partners on the ground and gives a unique data point regarding the separated and reunited families.\n\nThe report, along with resources and information about family separation, are available on the LIRS website at www.lirs.org/childrens-issues.\n\nThe full text of the report can be found here: https://www.lirs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Serving-Separated-and-Reunited-Families_Final-Report-10.16.18-updated.pdf.\n\n---\n\nFor more than a decade, LIRS has been monitoring and advocating for children and families seeking asylum at our southern border. In 2007, LIRS published Locking Up Family Values detailing the practice of family immigration detention. In 2014, LIRS published Locking Up Family Values Again drawing attention to the renewed use and abuse of families at the border as an increasing number of families and children fled violence in Central America. Then in 2017, LIRS worked with coalition partners to publish a new report entitled Betraying Family Values that brought the matter of family separation to the attention of the Senate Judiciary Committee, ultimately resulting in the submission of a formal complaint to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nFounded in 1939, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service is one of the largest refugee resettlement agencies in the United States. It is nationally recognized for its leadership advocating with refugees, asylum seekers, unaccompanied children, immigrants in detention, families fractured by migration and other vulnerable populations. Through nearly 80 years of service and advocacy, LIRS has helped over 500,000 migrants and refugees rebuild their lives in America.\n\nPartner Spotlight: United Way\n\nUnited Way is a significant partner for Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas.

We honor our dads with barbecues, picnics, cards, and gifts. In 2016, U.S. consumers are predicted to spend over 12 billion dollars on Father's Day, making it a powerful commercial success. But the surprising truth is, Father's Day has only been officially recognized in the United States since 1972, nearly 60 years after Mother's Day became a holiday. The story of Father's Day is, in fact, one of a nearly century-long struggle to recognize dads' contributions, often by the daughters who loved them and worked to make the holiday what we have today.\n\nHistorical Roots\n\nJust as mothers have been celebrated throughout the centuries, fathers have been honored by various cultures in the past. In medieval Europe, the feast day of St. Joseph was celebrated to honor fathers in general, while Mothering Day was set aside to honor mothers. Interestingly, the earliest example of a father's celebration may be nearly 4000 years old, making it older than any recorded celebration of mothers. Archaeologists have found an ancient Babylonian tablet, signed by a dutiful son named Elmesu, wishing his father health and longevity. We can imagine that the tablet functioned much like the greeting cards we give our own dads each year.\n\nFather's Day Failures\n\nIt's difficult to pin down the first time Father's Day was celebrated in the modern United States, because so many people tried, and failed, to start the holiday. The first recorded occasion was on July 5, 1908, in Fairmont, West Virginia. There, a woman named Grace Golden Clayton held an event at her church to honor all fathers, perhaps inspired by the loss of her father, and others in the community, in a terrible mining tragedy. However, the tradition wasn't promoted, didn't catch on, and was not celebrated beyond the town of Fairmont. Miles away, in 1911, reformer Jane Addams suggested a day be set aside to honor fathers be in her hometown of Chicago, but was turned down by city officials. Others, including J.J. Berringer and Harry C. Meeks, also tried and failed to begin a national Father's Day tradition.\n\nThe Origins of Modern Father's Day\n\nAnother attempt was made in 1910, in Spokane, Washington, when Sonora Smart Dodd held a Father's Day celebration inspired by Mother's Day and by her own father. This event did catch on and spread to pastors throughout the city of Spokane and beyond, each preaching on the subject of fatherhood on the third Sunday of June. Even Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge visited Spokane and encouraged the celebration of Father's Day. Ms. Dodd stopped promoting the holiday during the 1920's, while she was away at school but began again just in time for the Great Depression. This time, manufacturers and retailers joined the campaign to encourage the celebration of Father's Day, hoping to buoy their sales with dad-themed merchandise.\n\nDad's Day Doubters\n\nPerhaps because of these commercial ties, many Americans initially resisted the push for a national Father's Day holiday. They viewed the occasion cynically, as yet another attempt to get consumers to buy unnecessary products. Skeptics, especially in Congress, had been against the holiday since Dodd's first events in Spokane and opposed the attempts to recognize it at a federal level. Some suggested an alternative holiday, called Parent's Day, meant to replace both of the holidays for mothers and fathers. For decades, Congress fought attempts to make Father's Day a national holiday, but it began to gain popular support after World War II. Reframed as a masculine holiday, in recognition of fathers who were often veterans, Father's Day spread nationally.\n\nFinally, Federal Recognition\n\nBy 1956, the United States Congress had finally come around to recognizing Father's Day, passing a joint resolution to that end. Still, it took another decade until President Lyndon Johnson officially proclaimed the third Sunday in June to be a national holiday, and another 6 years for Nixon to permanently establish it as a holiday. In spite of all these years of struggle, there was a happy ending at last for Father's Day supporters, and, best of all, Sonora Dodd herself lived long enough to see it happen, dying in 1978 at the age of 96.\n\nFather's Day Today\n\nNow, Father's Day is one of the most successful and enjoyable summer holidays. It is celebrated around the world, with over 70 countries choosing the third day of June to commemorate their dads. Recent polls suggest that nearly three-quarters of Americans celebrate the holiday, honoring fathers and father figures alike. Popular gifts include electronics, sporting gear, and clothes. But the most common gift for Father's day? Much like in ancient Babylon, it is still the greeting card, perhaps proving after all that some things never change.\n\nMarch is Problem Gambling Awareness Month\n\n#HaveTheConversation about problem gambling to raise awareness for this often hidden disease\n\nDodge City (Feb 21, 2018) - For the 14th year, the Southwest Kansas Problem Gambling Task Force in collaboration with the National Council on Problem Gambling dedicates March to helping people “have the conversation” about problem gambling. Approximately 2 million (1%) of U.S. adults are estimated to meet criteria for pathological gambling, another 4-6 million (2-3%) would be considered problem gamblers; yet for many, gambling remains a hidden addiction.\n\nProblem Gambling Awareness Month is designed to help raise awareness of the prevention, treatment and recovery services available for those adversely affected by gambling. The grassroots campaign brings together a wide range of stakeholders---public health organizations, advocacy groups and gambling operators---including Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas, the Southwest Kansas Area Agency on Aging, Hope & Healing Counseling, the City of Dodge City, Boot Hill Casino and Resort and others---who work collaboratively to let people know that hope and help exist. “Across Kansas, groups hold conferences, host screening and training days, run media campaigns, and conduct outreach to people who can make a difference in ensuring that problem gambling services are widely available and accessible,” said Debbie Snapp, Chair of the Southwest Problem Gambling Taskforce.\n\nAs March Madness reaches a crescendo with an estimated $10 billion in bets placed on the NCAA basketball championship games, calls to the National Problem Gambling Helpline (1-800-522-4700) spike an average of 30% during the month.\n\nTo get help for a gambling problem for you or a loved one, call 1-800-522-4700. The call is free and confidential. For more information about problem gambling and how to have the conversation, go to http://www.swks-problemgambling.org.\n\nAbout Southwest Kansas Problem Gambling Task Force\n\nFounded in 2008, the mission of the Southwest Kansas Problem Gambling Task Force is to raise awareness and provide education to individuals, families and communities to reduce the harmful effects of problem gambling.\n\nThe Task Force is neither for nor against gambling, but concentrates on efforts to help those affected by problem gambling through public awareness, prevention and education programs and ensuring resources are available to problem gamblers and their families.\n\nAbout the National Council on Problem Gambling\n\nNCPG is the national advocate for problem gamblers and their families. NCPG is neutral on legalized gambling and works with all stakeholders to promote responsible gaming. For more information on the 32nd National Conference on Problem Gambling, visit www.ncpgambling.org/conference.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, call or text the National Problem Gambling Helpline Network at 1-800-522-4700 or visit www.ncpg.org/chat for confidential help.\n\nValentine's Day and Ash Wednesday: What's a girl to do?\n\nby Lori Titsworth\n\nValentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, is an annual holiday celebrated on February 14. It originated as a feast day honoring one or more early saints named Valentinus and is recognized as a significant cultural and commercial celebration in many regions around the world.\n\nThe day first became associated with romantic love within the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century, when the tradition of courtly love flourished. In 18th-century England, it evolved into an occasion in which lovers expressed their love for each other by presenting flowers, sweet treats and sending greeting cards, known as \"valentines.\" In Europe, Saint Valentine's Keys are given to lovers \"as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver's heart\", as well as to children, in order to ward off epilepsy.\n\nThis year, Valentine's Day is also shared with Ash Wednesday, a day of fasting, which signifies the first day of Lent in Western Christianity. This \"clashing\" of two very important days presents a problem for those of us who like to partake in a delicious bite of cheesecake (oh who are we kidding, I plan to eat a big slice or two or….), or chocolates or a gourmet dinner.\n\nIt is suggested that we celebrate Valentine's Day on Fat Tuesday (which seems only fitting as you most likely will add a little more girth to your waistline) and fast on Wednesday, thus honoring Ash Wednesday.\n\nI propose that on Wednesday, instead of smacking down a variety of goolicious treats, do something that doesn't cost an arm and a leg such as going for a long walk, a romantic drive or dare I say it, put your cell phone down and actually converse with someone and give them your undivided attention.\n\nLook, the fact of the matter is that you should be showing kindness, understanding, forgiveness, and love to those around you EVERY day . . . . not just on Valentine's Day….but if you want to send me flowers, I prefer roses."
