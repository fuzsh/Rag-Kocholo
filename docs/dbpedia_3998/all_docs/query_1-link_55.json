He was born April 4, 1933 in Sturgeon Bay, the son of Elmer Benjamin Blasier and Grace Marie (Marth) Blasier. Roger graduated from Sturgeon Bay High School with the class of 1951. He initially sailed for Roen Steam Ship Co. and worked as a marine oiler. Roger was united in marriage to Gail Annette Gustafson on May 2, 1953 at Sturgeon Bay Moravian Church (his home church). He served his country with the United States, entering into active service just a few weeks after his wedding, on May 19, 1953. While in the Army, Roger completed automotive and artillery track maintenance courses in the10th Infantry Division Artillery School. His primary assignment was with the Headquarters & Service Company 57th Tank Battalion, which had him working as a wrecker operator. Roger was honorably discharged from the Army on May 4, 1955 with the rank of Private First Class and was awarded the National Defense Services Medal, Army of Occupation Medal, recognition for serving in Germany, and the Good Conduct Medal. Upon his return home, he worked for Felhofer's Garage on the west side of Sturgeon Bay for five years before going to work for the Sturgeon Bay Post Office as a mail carrier. Roger retired from the Post Office in 1995. He was a lifelong member of Sturgeon Bay Moravian Church where he served as trustee and on various committees. Through his military service, Roger was a member of the V.F.W. Post #3088 in Sturgeon Bay. He was invited to go on the Old Glory Honor Flight in 2014. Roger was active in Boy Scouts throughout his life, initially as a scout, and then leading the next generations, including his son, Steven. He enjoyed fishing with his father and father-in-law earlier in life and with other family later on. Winter was the season for snowmobiling and skiing. Roger and Gail were blessed with two children, Steven and Kerrie, and shared nearly 71 years of marriage together. Gail passed away March 30, 2024. Roger will be missed by his children, Steven (Clessie) Blasier of Sturgeon Bay and Kerrie (Greg) Wheeler of Elroy; granddaughter, Jayne (Shawn) McCambridge; great-grandchildren, Arianna and William McCambridge; siblings, Dale (Kathy) Blasier of Sturgeon Bay and Jayne Wilke of Sheboygan; sister-in-law, LouAnn Blasier of Sturgeon Bay; nieces and nephews; other relatives; and friends. He was preceded in death by his parents; wife, Gail; son, Scott; brother, Robert Blasier; siblings-in-law, Vernon (Phyllis) Gustafson, Norman (Marge) Gustafson, Marie (Daniel) Kiedrowski, Allan Gustafson, and Janet (William) Claflin; and other relatives.

Wickman\n\nRichard Otto Wickman left his family and home in Sturgeon Bay, WI, for his heavenly home with his Savior on Sunday, August 25, 2024. Rich (or Dick) Wickman was born on December 9, 1943, to Paul and Bertha (nee Miller) Wickman in Sturgeon Bay. He was baptized and confirmed at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Sturgeon Bay and graduated from Sturgeon Bay High School in 1962. Rich married Patti Schmiling July 13, 1963, at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in Forestville. They have two children, Tammy and Tracy. Rich held a variety of jobs before starting his own business, Wickman Plumbing & Heating. He sold his business after about thirty years and eventually joined Eagle Mechanical as the head of the plumbing division where he still held a “consulting” position. If Rich wasn’t plumbing, you could probably find him on a softball field or basketball court either playing or officiating. Rich also loved being on the golf course or playing cards with family or friends. We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention how much Rich enjoyed his Department of Conversation coffee group. Rich’s family recalls numerous enjoyable family vacations over many years. One notable trip to Galena, IL, celebrated Rich and Pat’s 60th wedding anniversary. Rich was a hard-working, God-fearing role model, as well as a loving husband, a homerun dad, the royal flush of grandpas, a hole-in-one grampy, and the world’s greatest friend. Rich was preceded in death by his parents, Paul and Bertha Wickman and nephew Craig Stephenson. He is survived by his wife Pat, daughters Tammy (Paul) Lutze, Tracy (Dr. Timothy) Belleau, grandchildren Quin Lutze, Caimyn (Will) Kitchens, Jesse Belleau, Miriah (Cameron) Seidl, great-grandchildren Cooper and Stella Seidl, siblings Susie/Mary (Bob) Jahnke, Peter (Dorothy) Wickman, Carol Stephenson, and many nieces and nephews. Rich’s family is having a private funeral but is inviting you to join us for a celebration of Rich’s life on Sunday, September 8, from noon to three at the Cherry Hills Golf Course Greenside Lounge in Sturgeon Bay (5905 Dunn Rd.). In lieu of flowers and plants, memorials may be directed to St. Peters Lutheran Church or School (of Sturgeon Bay, WI). Forbes Funeral Home is serving the family. We are sure that when God’s angels picked up Rich to take him to heaven, he looked around and said, “Everybody in?”\n\nBetty Mae Holland\n\nBetty Mae Holland, 96, of Sister Bay, passed away peacefully on August 23, 2024, with her family by her side.

Not to be outdone, at age 64, he would race his own car that his sons built for him. He was known as the “Black Stallion” because he had no fear while racing. If it was racing season, family and friends knew Les and the boys would be at the track every Saturday night. He helped start the Door County Racing Association in the 70’s serving as President and was a member of the Door County Tavern League. In retirement, Les could be found riding the mower around his property. He loved cutting the lawn and being in the garden. Simply said, he loved being outdoors.

Discharged in 1962, Myron returned to the family farm. He met his wife Becky (Lumaye) Stepanek just down the road in Slovan, in 1983. By the year 1985 they had married and moved into their home on the Stepanek Farm. Myron is the father of five children, Sharon, Kathy, Korey, Michael, and Stacy.

Carol was born August 13, 1940, to Sylvia Steinmetz Mueller and Willard Gray Mueller in Chippewa Falls, WI. In 1962, she met and, three months later, married David Miles Duffin, a large animal veterinarian; they enjoyed nearly thirty years of marriage prior to Dave’s passing in 1992. She is survived by her daughters, all of Sturgeon Bay, WI: Laurel (John) Hauser, Tracy (John) Vreeke, and Jacinda Duffin; and honorary son, Vince (Heidi) Jirik of Green Bay; as well as her sisters-in-law, Carol Mueller, Dorothy Duffin Saylor, and Bonnie Duffin. She is also survived by her grandchildren, Sylvia Hauser, Thomas Hauser (partner Cara Reisen), and Isabel Vreeke (fiancée, Kalea Bicoy); as well as many nieces and nephews. In addition to her husband, she was preceded in death by her parents; and two siblings, Marion Mueller Boehm and Keith Mueller; niece, Jodyne Reiten; and numerous in-laws. Carol enjoyed a childhood surrounded by cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. She and her friends had free range of all small-town Chippewa Falls had to offer – biking to the A & W, swimming at Lake Wissota, and exploring Irvine Park. Her first job was at the Chippewa Falls Welcome Center, fitting for a woman who spent a lifetime welcoming people of all ages into her home. Her small-town roots never left her, and many early friends remained friends for life. An enthusiastic and well-rounded student, Carol was chosen to attend Badger Girls State in Madison, WI, before graduating from Chippewa Falls High School in 1958. She continued her studies at UW-Stout, earning a teaching degree in Home Economics and started her teaching career in Bloomer, WI. As a married couple, Carol and Dave first lived in Colfax, WI, where they started a family, forged deep friendships, and enjoyed the antics and camaraderie of a town of 800. They later moved to West De Pere, WI, where Carol taught high school for more than 30 years. She was a natural teacher, beloved by students and colleagues alike. Mrs. Duffin’s door was always open; she was the teacher who had a dollar if you left your lunch money at home and time to talk if you were carrying a heavy load. She received numerous awards for her professionalism and leadership over her teaching career, but what made her happiest were phone calls from former students, even decades after her retirement, sharing how she had impacted their lives. Carol saw herself as part of a bigger community, modeling the importance of public service and political involvement all her life. She was a founding member of the first nursery school program in De Pere, was an active Girl Scout leader, and served on the Parents Council at Carroll University, her daughters’ alma mater. She and her husband were involved locally as school board members, volunteers, and active members at the First United Presbyterian Church of De Pere. In 2001, Carol moved to Sturgeon Bay where she made quick friends and forged close relationships with her Utah Street neighbors. Most importantly, she was a daily presence for her family and the grandchildren she adored. Carol was fun to be around, kind beyond measure, and her practicality guided her positive outlook. She saw the best in people and had a remarkable capacity for understanding and acceptance. She appreciated that there are many ways to do things in life, unless you were talking about getting cupcakes to rise or properly leveling a cup of flour; some things can only be done one way. She will be greatly missed. The family wishes to thank Linda Streyle for her care, attention and friendship in Carol’s final months. A celebration of life will be held at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, August 15, 2024, at Sturgeon Bay Moravian Church, 323 S. 5th Ave., followed by a reception in the church fellowship hall. A visitation prior to the celebration of life service will be held from 2:00 – 3:30 p.m. at the church.

Some of Carole’s best memories were made around various dining room tables playing card games or mahjong with her dear Door County friends and family. She also enjoyed her social gatherings in various Door County restaurants. Carole took great pleasure in traveling the world with her favorite sister Mary. The two shared the passion of seeing new places, experiencing new cultures and enjoying various local cuisines.

Gills Rock sunsets, Yorkie puppies, birds, daisies and sunflowers, handmade delicate doilies, a glass of Zinfandel, green for emerald, word puzzles and her life-long passion of collecting delicate fans were a few of her favorite things that will forever remind us of her. But most of all, Carole loved her nephew Dan. The love and respect the two had for each other was heartwarming and comforting to both. The special bond was created in Dan’s early childhood by their mutual love for Grandpa Charlie and time spent together in Gills Rock.

I was preceded in death by my parents, who lived to the ripe old age of 98 and 102, by my brother-in-law, Robert Owens, and my mother-in-law, Esther B. Sheehy. I died at home in Baileys Harbor, WI. After a friend asked me recently about my life, I began reflecting on what a rich life I have had, full of surprises, twists and turns. Several things stick out as life changing events. First, I grew up in the Christian Church, Disciples of Christ, from the time I was a baby. That gave me not only my faith foundation but provided me with space for much questioning and reflection. I spent many years attending Madison Ave. Christian Church in Covington, KY, and loved and cherished my many close friends there. From the time I was born until the 8th grade, our family moved 12 times in 12 years, many moves due to life’s unplanned circumstances. Those different experiences, with different people, different ways of life, different schools turned out to be invaluable in my growth and maturity. It made me adaptable and resilient. I learned to make friends quickly, and even though I might be the odd person out, I could survive and learn from the experience. In the 1950’s, our family settled in Northern KY where I attended Dixie Heights High School, Edgewood KY, University of Cincinnati, where I studied Interior Design, and the University of Kentucky, where I studied Fine Arts. After college, I worked in various interior design studios in Kentucky and Cincinnati. In 1969, a camping trip across country from the Apollo 11 moon shot in Cape Canaveral to an adventurous trip up the Alcan Highway, ended in Anchorage, Alaska. With a broken down car and no money, it prompted a stay. Anchorage had experienced a devastating earthquake shortly before my arrival and the town had no need for Interior Designers. As luck would have it, I was eventually able to get a job with the Anchorage Daily News. By a twist of fate, I was asked to become one of their photojournalist. With little previous photographic experience, I suddenly became a photographer and continued as a freelance photographer journalist for numerous years after leaving Anchorage. I continued to love photography long after I wasn’t doing it professionally. It was another one of those gifts you get in life when you aren’t expecting it. I learned you have to accept the challenge and enjoy it. In late 1977, after moving back to Northern Kentucky, I opened an Interior Design studio in downtown Covington, KY. I practiced there for over 23 years. Again, I had no experience or knowledge of running a business, but with the help and support of many close associates and incredible repeating clients, we were able to make it happen. We all worked hard (and laughed a lot) to make it a success. This was another gift that was dropped in my lap when I wasn’t expecting it. The best piece of advice I got was, “What do you have to lose? You can always close if it doesn’t work out.” We never had to do that. On October 31, 1985, I married my wonderful architect husband, and partner in life, Daniel Robert Sheehy. We were married in Door County, WI on a beautiful rock outcrop on the shores of Lake Michigan. In 1995, Dan joined the business, and we became an Architecture and Interior Design firm. We moved our business from Covington, KY to Ft. Thomas, KY in 2000 and practiced there for another 17 years before completely retiring in 2017. Dan and I pursued our passion of designing, building, and renovating. Starting with a spur of the moment decision to purchase an untamed piece of property, in beautiful Baileys Harbor. We molded it into a place that we have loved for 38 years. It is our place of joy and peace. Several years later, we purchased and renovated a small home in Bokeelia, Florida, on Pine Island, FL. It was another adventure and something we loved doing. We designed, built, renovated and maintained throughout our time together. Both were gifts we were not expecting, but it has brought us joy for many years. I was a homebody and an avid daydreamer. I loved sitting on our back deck staring into the woods, watching the birds flutter and the butterflies flitter. I loved painting, and it became an important part of my life. I loved all the delicious meals with neighbors and friends sipping wine, laughing and telling use-to stories about all the things we use-to be able to do. It has been a contented life. Dan and I have been so lucky to have many incredible and full of love friends and family in our lives. They surrounded us with comfort, support and so much kindness. Just know that we love you very much and you have made our lives, and this life transition, a happy and peaceful one for both of us. We will never be able to thank you enough for your compassion and caring. I leave behind my wonderful, caring husband, Dan Sheehy, my very beloved siblings, Dexter Meyer, III, Nancy (Steve) Kingsley, Joellen Owens (Dennis Helton), my vivacious sister-in-law, Lisa (Jim) Firlan, my cherished nieces and nephews, to whom I am known as Crazy Aunt Linda, Cadie (Brennan) Sweeney, Kyle (Josh) Warning, Carrie (Tim) Powers, Sarah Kingsley, and the beautiful, incredible, smart great-nieces and nephews, Mason and Brooklin Sweeney, Kendal and Claire Powers, and Salvatore Nassano. As a final reflection, I am reminded that the ultimate goal is to celebrate life every day and to cherish every one who comes into your life. Embrace those opportunities that fall in your lap and run with them. The rewards will be exciting and often unexpected. And remember to smile and laugh. It will certainly brighten your every day. A special thanks to the wonderful folks on the hospice team at Unity Hospice. They were with us every step of the way to guide us through this process.
