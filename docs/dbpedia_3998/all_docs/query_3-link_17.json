        "text": "BERKELEY COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - Deputies said a man they have been searching for since Wednesday is in custody.\n\nThe Berkeley County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the capture of 24-year-old Charles Edward Britt Jr. Monday morning.\n\nDeputies said Britt was located in the Francis Marion National Forest sleeping around 2 a.m. Monday. He was located by two K-9s and a search team.\n\nBritt had two firearms and ammunition with him when he was located, deputies said. He’ll face new charges related to the multi-day manhunt.\n\n“The Air Support Unit spotted him lying down in the woods and brought the K-9 team into that particular area and he resisted arrest,” Sheriff Duane Lewis said.\n\nBritt, of St. Stephen, was wanted on charges of attempted murder, two counts of pointing and presenting, armed robbery, grand larceny, two counts of possession of a weapon during a violent crime and two counts of possession of a weapon during a violent crime by a felon, Cpl. Carli Drayton said.\n\nDeputies had been searching for him since Wednesday when he allegedly struck someone with a pole and aimed a gun at someone’s head and pulled the trigger. The gun misfired, at which point Britt pointed the gun at a dog and then fired into the ground, deputies said.\n\n“He’s also looking at probation and parole violations as well. And he’s a felon. He is prohibited from possessing a firearm and he had two stolen ones in his possession when we apprehended [him,]” Lewis said.\n\nAmid a report that a man wearing a ski mask tried unsuccessfully to steal a motorcycle at gunpoint Sunday near the Francis Marion Forest, Chief Deputy Jeremy Baker said deputies believe that man may have been Britt.\n\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Charleston County Sheriff’s Office, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, the South Carolina Forestry Commission and the state Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services assisted in the search.\n\n“You know, there were technical things we were doing that we could not tell the public, but we were in those areas. We saturated those areas. In some situations, they didn’t know we were there by design. But we stayed on it around the clock, a lot of hard work long hours and the people can rest assured that we’re going to do everything we can to make sure he stays in jail,” Lewis said.\n\nLewis says Britt had a survival kit with him and they are currently looking into if he had any help while he was on the run and will address that as needed.\n\n“The indication, to me, is he may have had some help from folks in a different community that he comes from. We’re looking into that now. But he was able to use the forest to his advantage. But in the end, our tracking team, SLED’s bloodhound tracking team and [the] Charleston County tracking team did a fabulous job,” Lewis said.\n\nLewis said Britt was lighting fires across the forest, and he suspects Britt was using the fires to keep himself warm and to attempt to throw law enforcement off his scent and tracks. Britt will face additional charges for the manhunt once he is fully processed.\n\nHe was booked into the Hill Finklea Detention Center."
