F. Harker, a young school teacher about twenty-five years of age, went to his room at noon on Saturday last, locked himself up and then swallowed a deadly dose of morphine. When found two hours later he was in an unconscious state from which he never recovered, expiring about 8 o'clock that evening. His most intimate friends cannot assign any reaosn for the rash act except it be financial embarrassment as he was known to be considerably involved. After his death a letter was found written last April, making disposition of his effects, which goes to show that he has contemplated the act for some time. As to whether this letter throws any light upon his strange actions we are unable to state as we have conversed with no one who had seen it or knew its contnents any more than we have stated.\n\nThe sad ending of Mr. Harker was indeed a surprise to everyone who knew him, as he was a very exemplary young man, highly cultured and seemed possessed of rare intellect. He had for the past year been principal in the grammer department of the Columbus schools and made application for the same position the ensuing year but for some reason his application was rejected. By some this is believed to be the cause of him suiciding. But after failing to secure the position in the Columbus schools he abandoned the idea of teaching and had perfected his plans for the ministry in the Baptist church and was to have preached in Columbus last Sunday. He was a prominent worker in the Young Men's Christian Association, and this organization took charge of his remains and gave them decent burial last Tuesday morning in the Columbus cemetery.\n\n(Baxter Springs News ~ July 12, 1890)\n\nProf. S. E. Harker, late principal of the Columbus public schools, suicided recently by taking morphine. He was supposed to have been insane at the time, as a diary left showed that insanity was hereditary in the family.

Harshman died at the Columbus hospital last evening at 6 o'clock.\n\nHarshman was hurried to Columbus after the shooting and for two or three days it was thought that his recovery was impossible. He improved, however, after undergoing an operation and was able to be taken home on July 16. Just a month later, on August 16, he was returned to the hospital and in twenty-four hours he was dead.\n\nAlthough the statements of the attending physicians could not be secured this afternoon, it is said that Harshman's death was due directly to the two bullet wounds he received at the hands of the fleeing bandits. The wounds never healed and they brought on complications which hurried the end.\n\nHOW HARSHMAN WAS SHOT\n\nWhen it became known that some one was in the Crestline garage about 1 o'clock the morning of May 4, the owner of the garage and three or four other men attempted to capture them. While the others approached the garage from the rear Harshman was left to guard a motor car which had been left with lights out, a short distance north of the railroad tracks. When the bandits ran from the garage to their car, Harshman, who was standing near the grain elevator, ordered them to stop. He was greeted with two bullets fired at close range. He returned fire but his shots went wild and the bandits got away. One bullet went through Harshman's body piercing the bladder, and the other lodged in one of his hips.\n\nWhile Harshman was being brought to Columbus, the bandits were traced to a point near Carl Junction where the trail was lost. They are still at large although the officer have run down several clues which at the time threatened to bring results. County Attorney Don H. Elleman said this afternoon that if shooting was contributory to Harshman's death, the men would be charged with first-degree murder if caught.\n\nFuneral services for Harshman were held from the First Christian church at Crestline this afternoon and burial was made in the Wirtonia cemetery. Harshman was about 50 years old and a bachelor.\n\n(Columbus Daily Advocate ~ Saturday ~ August 18, 1917 ~ Page 1)\n\nHART, CORA\n\nMrs. Cora Hart, wife of John Hart, died early this morning at Lowell.
