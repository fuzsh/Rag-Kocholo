        "text": "Milestones in the history of artificial insemination\n\nUnofficial history claims that the first attempts to artificially inseminate a woman, were done by Henry IV (1425-1474), King of Castile, nicknamed the Impotent. In 1455, he married Princess Juana, sister of Afonso V of Portugal. After six years of marriage she gave birth to a daughter, Joanna. Many contemporary historians and chroniclers assumed Henry was impotent. The possibility of artificial insemination was launched. Later on it was claimed that the princess was not the daughter of the king.\n\nSpermatozoa were first seen and described by Antoni van Leeuwenhoek and his assistant Johannes Ham in 1678 in the Netherlands. In a letter to William Bounker of the Royal Society of London (Phil.Trans. Vol.XII, nbr. 142, 1678) he showed a picture of sperm cells of the human and the dog. van Leeuwenhoek described the spermatozoa as “zaaddiertjes” or “living animalcules in human semen ... less than a millionth the size of a coarse grain of sand and with thin, undulating transparent tails”. He draws the conclusion that the tails must be operated by means of muscles, tendons and joints (Mol, 2006; Kremer, 1979). van Leeuwenhoek did not study Latin, the scientific language of the day. Nevertheless, his paper amazed and perhaps amused the reigning King of England.\n\nMore than 100 years later, in 1784, the first artificial insemination in a dog was reported by the scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani (Italian physiologist, 1729-1799). This insemination resulted in the birth of three puppy’s 62 days later (Belonoschkin, 1956; Zorgniotti, 1975). It is believed that Spallanzani was the first to report the effects of cooling on human sperm when he noted, in 1776, that sperm cooled by snow became motionless.\n\nThe first documented application of artificial insemination in human was done in London in the 1770s by John Hunter, which has been called in medical history the “the founder of scientific surgery”. A cloth merchant with severe hypospadias was advised to collect the semen (which escaped during coitus) in a warmed syringe and inject the sample into the vagina.\n\nJ Marion Sims reported his findings of postcoital tests and 55 inseminations in the mid 1800s. Only one pregnancy occurred but this could be explained by the fact that he believed that ovulation occurred during menstruation. JM Simms was born in Lancaster County (USA) in 1813. In 1863 he began writing his innovative work Clinical Notes on Uterine Surgery, which was controversial but widely read. Its revolutionary approach to female diseases was refreshing and its emphasis on treatment of sterility, including artificial insemination, was ahead of its time.\n\nIn 1897 Heape, an outstanding reproductive biologist from Cambridge, reported the use of AI in rabbits, dogs and horses. Heape also studied the relationship between seasonality and reproduction, as a result of his research Cambridge became a world centre for reproductive studies.\n\nIn 1899 the first attempts to develop practical methods for artificial insemination were described by Ilya Ivanovich Ivanoff (Russia, 1870-1932). Although Ivanoff studied artificial insemination in domestic farm animals, dogs, rabbits and poultry, he was the first to develop methods as we know today in human medicine. He was a pioneer in the selection of superior stallions multiplying their progeny through AI. The work of Ivanoff was taken over by Milovanov, another Russian scientist. He published his paper on “Artificial insemination in Russia” in the Journal of Heredity in 1938. Milovanov established major projects for cattle breeding and designed the first artificial vaginas, very similar to those used today.\n\nThe innovating work in Russia inspired Eduard Sörensen from Denmark to organize the first cooperative dairy AI organization in Denmark in 1933, followed by the introduction of the first AI cooperative in the US in 1938 by EJ Perry, a dairyman from New Jersey. In the US and other Western countries the number of AI cooperatives increased rapidly. Nowadays more than 90 % of dairy cows are artificially inseminated in the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom. November 1, 1939, the first animal, a rabbit, conceived by artificial insemination was exhibited in the United States at the 12th Annual Graduate Fortnight at the New York Academy of Medicine. Gregory Pincus, an American biologist, removed an egg from the ovary of a female rabbit and fertilized it with a salt solution. The egg was then transferred to the uterus of a second rabbit, which functioned as an incubator. Dr. Pincus conducted his experiments at Harvard University.\n\nConsidering humans, only after the introduction and availability of donor sperm, artificial insemination became very popular (AID). For many years homologous artificial inseminations were only indicated in cases of physiologic and psychological dysfunction, such as retrograde ejaculation, vaginismus, hypospadias and impotence.\n\nWith the routine use of post-coital tests other indications were added such as hostile cervical mucus and immunologic causes with the presence of antispermatozoal antibodies in the cervical mucus.\n\nThe first reports on human artificial insemination originated from Guttmacher (1943), Stoughton (1948) and Kohlberg (1953a; 1953b). It was the real start of a new era in assisted reproduction.\n\nOther important research discoveries in animal studies undoubtly influenced the development of artificial insemination, also in human. Phillips and Lardy (1939) were the first to use egg yolk to protect bull sperm cells from temperature shock upon cooling. This protection was explained by the effect of phospholipids and lipoproteins in the egg yolk. Salisbury et al. (1941) improved the media by using egg yolk with sodium citrate, permitting the use of semen at 5° C for up to three days. Polge and co-workers (1949) were the first to freeze fowl and bull spermatozoa by using glycerol in the extender media. In 1950 Cornell University scientists (New York) discovered the benefit of antibiotics added to the sperm solution in artificial insemination processes. The so-called Cornell extender (Foote and Bratton, 1950) contained the antibiotic mixture of penicillin, streptomycin and polymyxim B and was used for many years as the standard. Antibiotics are still used for the protection against possible contamination.\n\nIn 1953 Dr. Jerome K. Sherman, an American pioneer in sperm freezing, introduced a simple method of preserving human sperm using glycerol. He combined this with a slow cooling of sperm, and storage with solid carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. Sherman also demonstrated for the first time that frozen sperm, when thawed, were able to fertilize an egg and induce its normal development.\n\nAs a result of this research, the first successful human pregnancy with frozen spermatozoa was reported in 1953. Considering the hostile climate for DI at the time (the Cook County Supreme Court ruled that artificial insemination with donor semen was contrary to public policy and good morals) it is not surprising that nearly a decade passed before the first successful birth from frozen sperm was announced in public, a major breakthrough in history.\n\nConsidering all these new developments, it could be expected that in the 1970s the sperm bank industry became very popular and commercialized, especially in the United States.\n\nLegal, socio-cultural and religious considerations surrounding artificial donor insemination\n\nThe moral and social implications of artificial insemination were debated in both the medical and popular press in the United States since 1909, in Europe the debate started in the 1940s. The Catholic Church objected to all forms of artificial insemination, saying that it promoted the vice of onanism and ignored the religious importance of coitus. The main criticism was that artificial insemination with donor semen was a form of adultery promoting the vice of masturbation. Other critics were concerned that AID could encourage eugenic government policies.\n\nNevertheless, the demand for donor sperm increased tremendously. After the first successful pregnancy from frozen sperm, reported in 1953, the development of a thriving sperm-bank industry starting in the 1970s and the commercialization of AID became unavoidable. The growing number of AID‘s raised new concerns leading to new regulations. Because of the possible transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, when using fresh sperm screening for infections of donors became mandatory. The use of fresh donor semen samples almost disappeared.\n\nAnother concern is the possibility to donate semen many times. In order to diminish the chances of unknowing marriage of biological siblings among AID children some government regulations tightly restrict the number of times a single donor’s semen may be used and/or restrict the number of children by a given donor.\n\nSociocultural concerns with biological paternity and the maintenance of the heterosexual, married couple as the basis of the family remain important in many countries. A lot of countries all over the world have not approved the use of AI with donor semen for single women and lesbian couples yet. Another point of debate is whether the donor has to be anonymous or non-anonymous, and when to inform and what to tell AID children about their biological parentage, if non-anonymous donors are used. Is it possible and/or advisable to use sperm of relatives, such as brothers or the father? Whether or not to pay the donors and sexing of sperm by DNA quantification using flow cytometry instrumentation became a point of discussion."
