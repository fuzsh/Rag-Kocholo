It's cosmopolitan but still keeps its Spanish charm and visiting at Christmas time made it even more special with giant angels adorning the main square.\n\nIf you are planning a trip to Seville, Spain, below is my guide to how to travel solo in Seville as well as lots of practical information such as where to stay, which tour company to use and how to get around. Find out how to get from the airport and the best things to do in Seville. Just choose the relevant section or read the full article.\n\nContents\n\nSolo Travel in Seville\n\nAbout Seville\n\nTop Things To See in Seville\n\nBest Things To Do in Seville For Solos\n\nTours in Seville\n\nBest Areas To Stay in Seville\n\nBest Places To Stay in Seville\n\nWhere To Eat in Seville\n\nRestaurants For Typical Cuisine\n\nVegetarian Restaurants in Seville\n\nEnjoy a Coffee and Cake\n\nSeville Bars\n\nThings To Do in Seville At Night\n\nGetting Around Seville\n\nFrom Seville Airport To City Centre\n\nMy Verdict\n\nSolo Travel in Seville\n\nSeville is really easy to visit. It is walkable, there is a lot to see and do and it has a nice friendly vibe. The locals are very courteous and restaurants and tour guides speak some English but outside of these situations you may need some basic Spanish to get by.\n\nThe centre of Seville is safe but try to avoid the bus station at night if you can. One area of the city to avoid is Las Tres Mil in the south of the city and be careful of pickpockets in the touristy area of Metropol Parasol.\n\nStay for – 3 to 5 nights.\n\nAbout Seville\n\nThe capital of the Andalusia region, Seville has to be one of the most romantic cities in Spain. Beautiful, cultural and full of charm, Seville is just beautiful and has historic plazas, stunning palaces, and old winding streets.\n\nA blend between Islamic and Catholic cultures, it is home to one of the oldest palaces in Europe, the Real Alcazar de Sevilla, a Moorish-style palace which was once home to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand.\n\nFounded by the Romans, you’ll also find Roman ruins amongst the Moorish baths, and churches – once former mosques. Plaza de Espana is the city’s most important and vibrant square full of Spanish history, detailed archways and even a canal to sail along on.\n\nAndalusians boast that they have the best tapas cafes, and the Macarena district certainly does not disappoint. Fill up on flavoursome dishes before visiting the La Macarena Basilica then head to the cultural district of Triana, home to Seville’s flamenco to one of the authentic flamenco bars known as a tablaos.\n\nJust walking through the city you’ll discover beautiful, hidden corners and atmospheric streets quintessentially Andalusian. This city is a photographer’s dream and Avenida La Palmera has some of Seville’s prettiest architecture dating back to the early 20th century.\n\nSeville is bursting with history, from La Giralda – a lone minaret, to the Cathedral of Saint May of the See where Christopher Columbus is buried. This cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers fantastic views of Seville.\n\nEasy to navigate on foot, everything is at your footstep. From Maria Louisa Park with beautiful fountains, pavilions and orange trees, to Castillo San Jorge, and Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporaneo, a former monastery turned contemporary art museum.\n\nThe shopping is great and the festivals are first class. Seville holds one of the best annual Semana Santa celebrations in the whole of Spain so avoid visiting in Easter if you don’t like crowds.\n\nWith historic plazas, and fantastic architecture, if you love flamenco and Spanish guitar you will fall in love in Seville.\n\nDid you know?\n\nSeville has appeared in movies! Plaza de Espana appeared in Star Wars as the Theed Royal Palace on Planet Naboo. The location was also used in the movie, Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nTop Things To See in Seville\n\n1. Alcázar Palace\n\nAs the most visited and also most impressive monument in the city, the palace was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. Built by the Moorish rulers who once occupied Seville from the 8th century, it was later claimed by the Catholic Kings. The palace is simply stunning with Islamic art and Renaissance and Gothic design.\n\nIt is the oldest royal palace which is still in use today (by the King of Spain). With stunning architecture and mosaics, you don't need to get a guide unless you want to learn more about the history. Pre-book your ticket to avoid any queues. (TIME = 2-4 hours).* Check rates and availability: Alcazar Guided Tour with Priority Entrance\n\n2. The Giralda / The Catedral de Sevilla\n\nAlso known as The Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See, this huge Roman Catholic cathedral is the largest Gothic building in Europe and also the third largest on the continent. Built on the site of a mosque from 1402 to 1506 it is also said to have the largest altarpiece in the world with 45 carved scenes from the life of Christ.\n\nInside it is lavishly designed, and although opulent with gold decoration it has a sense of simplicity about it. Inside is also the tomb of Christopher Columbus where his remains were transferred from Cuba.\n\nThe ticket also includes entrance to the Giralda, one of the only parts of the mosque which has been preserved. This lone minaret is now a bell tower and if you can climb to the top of the tower on the 30+ ramps (there aren’t any stairs) you’ll be rewarded with a great view. Get here early to avoid the queues. (TIME 1-2 hours) * Check rates and availability: Seville Cathedral and Giralda: Skip The Line Ticket\n\n3. Plaza de Espana\n\nPlaza de Espana was built in the early 15th century and is one of the prettiest squares in Seville. The layout is beautiful with gardens, water fountains and buildings worthy of starring in movies.\n\nThis monumental plaza is a magical place to visit, and next to Maria Luisa Park so you can relax in nature afterwards. (TIME – 1 hour)\n\nEscape the crowds\n\nOn a boat trip to Sanlucar la Mayor. The boat takes you along the Guadalquivir River past the gorgeous Donana National Park. Or at Maria Louisa Park sitting in one of the ceramic benches amongst organs trees, admiring the statues and pine canopies.\n\nLose yourself\n\nEscape from the buzz of the city and lose yourself amongst the trees and the nature of Murillo Gardens. Then admire the church before enjoying a chilled beverage at one of the cute bars.\n\nGet a great view\n\nThe waffle-like structure of Metropol Parasol, which was inspired by the vaults of Seville Cathedral, with four levels. Entry to the observation viewpoint is less than €5 for views of the entire city and it is open from 10:00 to 23:00.\n\nAt the La Giralda. Just climb the ramps for amazing views across the city.\n\nAt Corte Ingles, Spain’s well-known department store. Take the lift to the 5th floor to enjoy a coffee or a bite to eat on its swanky terrace with views of the city.\n\nInteract with the locals\n\nSevillanos have a love for the outside so just look outside the bars where they congregate during the warmer months.\n\nPlaces to enjoy the sun\n\nIf you are looking for a great place for a sunset the Doña Maria Hotel has Seville’s oldest rooftop terrace. From here you can see views of La Giralda and the Cathedral whilst enjoying a cold drink and enjoying the sunset.\n\nMarkets\n\nTriana market is just across the Triana Bridge and is the city’s main food market. It was built over an old castle, and has lots of tapas choices with fruit, vegetables and meat to buy. The names of the shop fronts are displayed on big mosaic tiles.\n\nIf you like antique shopping, Plaza de Cabildo has an antiques market every Sunday within its square. On a Thursday morning browse the antiques market at Calle Feria.\n\nLocal’s Tip: “Santa Cruz is a cute neighbourhood with pretty buildings and winding streets. It’s my favourite place in Seville.”\n\nSolo’s Tip: “The ticket for the cathedral includes a visit to a church so buy tickets at the small church instead to bypass the queue. Either get to the Alcazar early to beat the crowds, or buy your ticket in advance to skip the line.”\n\nBest Things To Do in Seville For Solos\n\nActive Girl about the Globe (GatG)\n\nJoin the sporty locals and go for a jog along the riverside. Or just take a walk from the Giralda, past the cathedral to the Barrio Santa Cruz for a free sightseeing walk.\n\nAdventure GatG\n\nRent a rowing boat and and see the city, and especially Plaza de Espana from the water’s edge.\n\nAdrenalin GatG\n\nDid you know you could bungee jump in Seville? Throw yourself over a lake from 25 metres and experience an adrenalin rush in Spain.\n\nArty & Museum GatG\n\nCastillo San Jorge is an interesting museum and well laid out. It is the former HQ and prison of the Spanish Inquisition. Inside one of the darkest times in the history of Spain (during Catholic Spain) is bought to life. The entrance is next to the market.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts was founded in the early 19th century and features artwork ranging from the Middle Ages all the way to the 20th century. Inside its old convent walls you’ll find masterpieces from famous artists such as Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, a Baroque painter.\n\nThe Archaeological Museum of Sevilla is interesting if you enjoy history. Over three floors the rooms are beautifully organised with Roman mosaics, frescoes and elegant statues rescued from the site of Italica, which is nearby. The museum is in chronologic order and has Paleothic artefacts from the 6th century. It doesn’t take long to get around either.\n\nThe Museum of Popular Arts and Traditions is a must if you like all things lace. Situated in a beautiful building in Maria Luisa Park, inside you’ll find traditions such as olive pressing, tile painting and the making of Spanish guitars. It is quite small but it also has a lovely collection of embroideries and lace. This museum is near the Archeological Museum so it’s worth a stop to see both.\n\nBudget GatG\n\nCastillo San Jorge is free to visit every day. The Cathedral and Giralda are free on Sunday afternoons and the Alcazar Palace is free on Monday afternoons. Check with the tourist office for other sights and museums which have free days.\n\nIn the evenings look for the small bars called Peñas flamencas, which sometimes have free or discounted shows.\n\nCultural GatG\n\nThe Museo del Baile Flamenco is the place to learn about this country’s traditional dance. The museum is quite small and is in the first floor. At night they hold energising flamenco shows with lots of passion. The show costs approx €20 plus the museum entrance and are a great way to experience the Spanish culture and spend an evening.\n\nThe Flamenco Dance Museum also hosts traditional, live flamenco performances. See Spain's traditional dance in an 18th century building, for an hour in the evening and visit the Flamenco Dance Museum too.\n\n* Check dates, availability and prices: Flamenco Dance Museum Show Tickets\n\nHistory GatG\n\nSeville is full of history. If you are here in summer you may see the actors who re-enact Seville’s historic scenes from different places in the city.\n\nTake a free historical tour to learn more about the history of the city. Visit the Jewish Quarter, cathedral, Arab Palace and the Plaza Espana.\n\nIf not, take a Ronda Walking Tour to see the Mondragon Palace, Duquesa de Parcent Square and the Plaza de Toros (the bullring).\n\nOutside of Seville are the ruins of Italica, the first city in the Roman Empire which was built outside of Italy. You can take a tour to visit the ruins including the Monastery of San Isidoro del Campo.\n\nNature GatG\n\nHead south of the city centre to the Maria Luisa Park with Moorish designed fountains and plenty of greenery. This large, public park was once the gardens of the Palace of San Telmo. It has plenty of seating areas and a pond to sit and relax by. If you visit in the hot months there is shade to keep you cool.\n\nShopping GatG\n\nThey say that Sevillanos are the most fashionably dressed in Andalusia. You’ll find the usual chain and department stores here as well as artisan shops. The main shopping district is at Calle Sierpes and Tetuan where you can find everything from clothes and jewellery to tourist goods. Find clothing boutiques and upmarket shops at Los Remedios or Calle Asuncion or just wander through the side streets to find some unique shops. If you do go shopping here don’t forget that shops can close between 2-5pm for siesta.\n\nWellness GatG\n\nTreat yourself at Aire de Sevilla thermal baths where you can experience a jet stream room, steam bath and also harman. The spa is situated in an old 16th century mansion and they even have a salt bath to submerge yourself in.\n\nWine GatG\n\nSeville is full of bars serving local wine but if you are looking to enjoy a selection of Spanish wines in a group, you can sample eight red and white wines from Spain’s different regions, accompanied by a local wine expert on a wine tour.\n\nHave a tourist moment\n\nOn a segway tour, zooming around the city with others. Or indulge your inner child at Isla Magica Theme Park.\n\nDon’t have much time?\n\nMake sure you visit the Royal Alcazar of Seville and the Giralda which are in close proximity of each other and can be seen within a whole day.\n\nWhere to wear your heels\n\nAt the rooftop bar of the Casa Romana Hotel. This rooftop is aptly named “Roof” and is also one of the best places to get a good view of Seville. You’ll also find a good mix of locals and tourists here. Pre-book if you want to order dinner.\n\nTours in Seville\n\nJoin a Free Walking Tour and learn from guides who are art historians who tell you all about the city. You just give a donation at the end.\n\nTake a Guided Tour into Alcazar and get to skip the line. Led by a local guide you get to experience an hour’s tour of the UNESCO Alcazar and learn about its fascinating history.\n\nIf you love horse riding, explore the countryside on the back of a local breed of horse on a 3 hour experience.\n\nDay Tours – Get Your Guide helps you to find top-rated activities and day tours in worldwide destinations including Seville. Choose from a Cathedral and Giralda skip the line ticket, a Triana Tablao Flamenco show, or a 3-hour bike tour around the city’s highlights.

Here are my recommendations for solo travellers:\n\nSanta Cruz: This is the historic heart of Seville, full of narrow streets, beautiful architecture, and traditional Andalusian courtyards. It's a great place to stay if you want to be close to the city's main attractions, including the Cathedral and the Alcazar which are within walking distance.\n\nEl Arenal: This is the area around Seville's bullring, located just a short walk from the Cathedral. It's a great place to stay if you want to be close to the city's main sights and also want to experience the excitement of a bullfight.\n\nAlameda: This is a trendy and bohemian neighbourhood located just north of the historic centre. It's known for its lively nightlife, street art, and alternative culture.\n\nNervion: This is a more modern area located just east of the historic centre. It's a great place to stay if you want to be close to Seville's main shopping streets and also want easy access to public transport.\n\nTriana: This is Seville's traditional working-class neighbourhood, located across the river from the historic centre. It's a vibrant and lively area, with plenty of bars, restaurants, and flamenco venues.\n\nBest Places To Stay in Seville\n\nSeville offers a range of accommodation options to suit different budgets. These include hotels, hostels, apartments, and guesthouses. Hotels in Seville range from luxurious five-star options to more budget-friendly choices.\n\nHostels are a great option for solo travellers or those on a tight budget, as you can stay in a shared dorm as well as private rooms. Apartments are a good choice for those who want more space and privacy, while guesthouses and “pensiones” (family-run budget accommodation) offer a more traditional and homely experience.\n\nBelow are both my personal recommendations and recommendations from our solo female community on where to stay in Seville.
