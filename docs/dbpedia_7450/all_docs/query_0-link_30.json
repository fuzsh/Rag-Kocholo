        "text": "There is a well-worn Australian narrative. We are an island nation, a million miles from the world's centre of gravity. And we are a mining and resources economy, leaking talented individuals like water through a sieve. When, in the 1960s, Donald Horne described Australia as The Lucky Country, he meant lucky ironically. Our best resources lay underground, and our best people ventured overseas.\n\nThere is something depressing in this characterisation of Australia. But there is also something seriously dangerous about it. The danger is that we assume it is true. Martin Rogers, the CEO of Prima Biomed, shows that the opposite can be more accurate. Prima Biomed is a small Australian start-up commercialising a vaccine to tackle ovarian cancer.\n\nThe technology is Australian, and the company's headquarters are in Sydney. Together with a small set of companies like Mesoblast and Acrux, Prima Biomed is using Australia's advanced manufacturing power to sell pharmaceutical products on the world's stage. If these companies face barriers, they are not caused by distance or a small local market. Their biggest challenge is the lack of financial support from Australian private investors.\n\n\"The biggest problem is not that we lack big ideas,\" Rogers tells me as we meet in the foot of one of Sydney's skyscrapers. \"It's that we lack the venture capital investment in our start-up companies.\" As we sit in Sydney's financial epicenter, the irony is not lost on us.\n\nRogers places the largest blame with private investors, not the public sector. Recent changes to public tax incentives around research and development make Australia a relatively attractive destination for high-tech innovation. The problem is getting private investors to see the same opportunity.\n\nDespite having one of the world's largest funds-under-management industries, Australia has a mere 26 venture capital funds of which only about 10 are active. Venture capital is money invested in more risky enterprises with the expectation that they offer an out-of-the-ballpark return. With venture backing, entrepreneurs like Rogers can turn small companies into national icons. Without it, they are forced to approach US investors to make investment in Australian IP.\n\nVenture capital funds are just vehicles through which asset owners direct investment. The real risk aversion lies with the institutional investors themselves, such as pension funds. Even the Future Fund, Australia's sovereign wealth fund mandated to invest in nation-building infrastructure, education projects, and healthcare, has been shy about investing in the country's entrepreneurial future.\n\nThe key to changing investor confidence is to tell the stories of Australian entrepreneurs already achieving success. Too often, their achievements are sheltered from public view. \"I still don't think my parents know what I do,\" Adam Kirk tells me at a \"jelly\" in Melbourne. The event brings together young start-up entrepreneurs from across Melbourne once a fortnight to share ideas and get advice on how to grow their businesses. Kirk is self-funding himself to develop an alternative to taxis.\n\nIf we are to nurture the economic pillars to Australia's post-mining economy, we must overcome our natural caution towards start up entrepreneurship. A small population is not a problem. Israel is one of the world's most dynamic start-up nations at only 7.1 million people.\n\nAnd distance can be easily surmounted, especially as more talented expats return to Australia. One such expat, who has made the leap from international conglomerate to Australia start-up, is Michael Cameron, an ex-IBM employee. His prediction is for a rosy future. \"As more expats come back to Australia, we will have an amazing start-up community here,\" he tells me. But having clever people has never been our problem. It's finding the money that's willing to follow suit.\n\nEric Knight is chairing a panel called What's Killing Australian Innovation which has sold out at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas at the Sydney Opera House, Oct 1. www.ericknight.com.au\n\nFour entrepreneurs describe their path to success\n\nMichael Cameron and Bernhard Tschirren\n\nAge: Both are 31.\n\nCompany name: rome2rio\n\nThe big idea:\n\nCreating a website so you can travel in real life like The Amazing Race.\n\nHow did you catch the idea?\n\nDuring our own travels, we were frustrated by the lack of a comprehensive site for searching non-air travel such as trains and buses. Existing travel search engines focus on flights and only let you input a large city or airport as your destination. We wanted a tool to help us discover how to reach places like the Cinque Terre, the Grand Canyon or Cannes.\n\nHow are you financed?\n\nWe are self-financed. We both worked as software engineers for Microsoft in Seattle, so we're living off savings from those jobs.\n\nHow does your typical day unfold?\n\nWe are both engineers, so most of the day is spent building the rome2rio website and adding new features or data to the site. Typically we'll have a few meetings each week with advisors, or attend a startup related gathering such as Melbourne Jelly, Silicon Beach Drinks, The Hive or Travelmassive.\n\nWhat's your exit route?\n\nWe're developing some unique technology that we could sell to an online travel agency such as Expedia, Kayak or Webjet or to a web search company such as Google or Bing. Another option is to build rome2rio into a profitable business.\n\nWhat's the inspiration?\n\nWe're inspired by the plethora of innovative travel startups in Australia, from big successes such as Lonely Planet, Webjet and Wotif to new players such as Adioso, GetFlight, and Travellerspoint.\n\nShelli Trung\n\nAge: 29\n\nCompany name: 3six5dates\n\nThe big idea\n\nIt is a reality dating blog which follows four women, in four separate international cities, taking on 365 dates between them within the period of one year.\n\nHow did you catch the idea?\n\nI watched the movie Julie and Julia (about a woman who cooks through all of the 524 recipes in Julia Child's cookbook in 365 days). From that I got the inspiration to conduct my own experiment. Men and women have different expectations of a date. I wanted to add a cultural dimension to that. With Sex and the City over, I wanted to reclaim the voice of the successful, smart, woman who had her life together.\n\nHow are you financed?\n\nI had spent a few years buying and renovating property in Melbourne since 2006. I have been fortunate enough to have turned over some income in order to self-finance my business at present.\n\nHow does your typical day unfold?\n\nI currently have a team of 25 volunteers working across four separate timezones. I start the day with a few Skype meetings with my team and/or potential partners on the east coast of USA. In the afternoon I review their work and finish up very late at night with Skype calls to the UK.\n\nWhat's your exit route?\n\nThe 3six5dates 'social experiment' will run to 365 dates. But the idea is infinite and can move into books, TV shows, and movies.\n\nWhat's the inspiration?\n\nI visited Mother Teresa's \"Home for the Dying and Destitute\" in Calcutta, India back in 2005 and I was inspired by what I saw. We are blessed in Australia with the opportunity to make a real difference to those who are unable to help themselves â€“ and 3six5dates is my attempt to create something that may one day yield enough results to help those in need.\n\nAdam Kirk\n\nAge: 25\n\nCompany name: Cocoride\n\nThe big idea: Online carpooling for university students and large organisations\n\nHow did you catch the idea?\n\nThe idea came to me while traveling the east-coast of Australia in my camper van. I was looking for travelers to share the journey, experience and cost with. I managed to find people via notices I pinned in hostels. But I believe an online version would work better for a lot more travelers.\n\nHow are you financed?\n\nAt the moment I am living off savings, while supplementing this with the occasional small web project here and there. I see everything now in terms of time. For example, the $50 I pay a month for car insurance, this could buy me two days rent. I sold my car last week and cancelled the insurance policy.\n\nHow does your typical day unfold?\n\nIt starts around 8am, have my usual oats and yogurt, check emails and hacker news. I then head to the gym, then depending on the day I will either head into a co-working space (such as Inspire9), work from home or go to the library. I work on my website and building contacts for the site.\n\nWhat's your exit route?\n\nI guess there are a few options. Sell to a large carpooling company to widen their global presence. Other option is to still be involved in the business but just take a step back and let someone run the operational side of things and keep this as a revenue stream to support building other businesses.\n\nWhat's the inspiration?\n\nMark Zuckerburg. I am 25 years old, to see someone who is 26 achieving such remarkable things in the technology world is amazing. I think once the mind sees that this is possible, it is much easier to believe that you too can make an impact on a large scale at this age.\n\nTim Bull\n\nAge: 40\n\nCompany name: Trunk.ly\n\nThe big idea:\n\nHow does your typical day unfold?\n\nCommunity management first thing, answering support questions, Twitter, commenting on blog posts about us and so forth then sync up with Alex (co-founder in NZ) via Skype. Typically the bulk of the day is coding when there are no other issues to deal with. Then, evenings are spent coding or networking with local technical groups and entrepreneurs. Last thing before bed is community management again.\n\nWhat's your exit route?\n\nFor our type of start-up it would most commonly be an acquisition but it's too early at the moment to say. No-one really knows the answer to this question even if they say they do!\n\nWhat's the inspiration?\n\nPretty typical things really like creating something from scratch that we believe in. We're also fortunate to have incredibly passionate people who believe in us and what we're doing; they're huge advocates for Trunk.ly and we don't want to let them down."
