        "text": "Overview\n\nRome2Rio is a firm which provides an online travel service. If you type in a start and end adress it will plan a variety of routes instantly to help the user get from place to place. This tool is very user friendly and Rome2Rio, 2016 state “Our travel search engine contains route information from over 4,800 transport operators in over 158 countries.”. Once Rome2Rio have planned a route which the user can pick from it then lists prices and links to travel operators so their selected route can be picked and bought from an array of different travel operators.\n\nUsability\n\nThis website is very easy to use and the flow is good. Althoiugh there may not be very intricit or visual graphics, they are straightforward and basic which makes them ideal for the user to interprate and does not complicate the users travel experience by making it clear and easy to use.\n\nFigure 1\n\n(AIPD – Simeon, 1999)\n\nFigure 1 is a tool which was created to help critically analyse companies websites by assessing their Positioning, Information, Attraction and Delivery. These four segments if executed properly can provide the company with an effective user-friendly website that will recieve lots of site traffic.\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe banners on the page are clear and show the user exactly where everything can be located with helpful drop downs. The web site is consitent with the firms Brand Image using the same colour scheme and font as the brand it means that the website flows and stays consitent with their brand image.\n\nSocial media\n\nThe website allows you to quickly post links and travel ideas on social media with a share tab on most pages, this means they can quickly share with their friends any travel ideas, therfore increasing the website traffic through word of mout promotion.\n\nOnline Consumers hirearchy of needs\n\n“While it is important to understand which characteristics can be successfully applied to a Web site’s design, it is equally important to understand the irrelative value in shaping a consumer’s experience, given the natural trade-offs that occur due to design complexity, resources limitations, or situational factors” (Valacich, Parboteeah & Wells, 2007)\n\nThis is an extract from an article which aims to investigate and assess the importance of different factors when designing an online interface for consumers to view your product or service and what is most important in having a successful web site.\n\nDesign\n\n“Consumers visit sites not only to search for products/ services, but also to have rich, entertaining experiences. These goals or objectives determine what type of tasks the consumer performs at a site.” (Valacich, Parboteeah & Wells, 2007). For Rome2Rio it could be argued that they meet this goal by providing a quick service which allows you too visually see the destination on the map and a drop down of prices and information, however it does not provide entertaing graphics and it could be made more engaging. However it could be argued both ways that the web-site should not sacrifice usability for entertainment but also the website may lose users if they sacrifice entertainment for content. Although I belive that Rio2Rome could do both and with some simple graphics could turn their website from a standard user-friendly website into an exciting, colourful website which both engages and provides information to the user.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall Rome2Rio is an exciting brand which provides a quick simple overview to the user for their best travel options whilst travelling home or abroad. However, with some simple graphics the website could engage with its customers and in turn would recieve more website traffic.\n\nReferences\n\nValacich, J.S., Parboteeah, D.V. and Wells, J.D., 2007.
