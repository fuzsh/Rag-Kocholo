        "text": "Traveling by train is the quintessential way to tour Europe. It’s romantic. It’s inspiring. It’s super-efficient. It’s comfortable. Some might say it’s almost magical. And to those who don’t live in a country where train travel is prominent, it’s a little mysterious.\n\nIn this Complete Guide To Train Travel In Europe, I’ll cover everything you need to know about traveling Europe by rail—including how to get the best price on train tickets, rail pass tips, understanding train schedules, tips for riding trains, how to navigate train stations, and advice for dealing with other issues you might encounter. By the end of this guide, you’re going to be a European train expert!\n\nQuick Tip: Most train tickets are now electronic so you’ll want fast and reliable mobile data on your phone when traveling via train. Check out my guide on how to use your phone in Europe and our guide to the best SIM Cards and Data Plans for Europe.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Europe Train Travel\n\nLet’s start with a quick overview of the positives and negatives of train travel in Europe.\n\nAdvantages Of Train Travel In Europe\n\nHere are all the things I love about riding the train in Europe:\n\nYou Arrive/Depart From The City Center\n\nUnlike airports, European train stations are located in the center of town—which saves you time and money.\n\nIn contrast, traveling from the airport to the city can take anywhere from 20-60 minutes and costs between $10-$80.\n\nNo Long Check-In and Security Lines\n\nThere are no lengthy check-in procedures or security screening for most train travel. You simply show up a few minutes before the train leaves, buy a ticket if you don’t have one, and hop on the train.\n\nNo Luggage Limits/Fees\n\nThere are no luggage weight limits or extra fees for multiple pieces of luggage—just make sure that you’re able to lift your bag onto the train.\n\nE-Tickets\n\nMost European trains now accept electronic tickets—you simply show your ticket on your phone. That means no waiting in ticket lines and it makes planning your train travel even easier.\n\nBring A Picnic (Don’t Forget The Wine and Beer)\n\nYou can pretty much bring whatever you want on a train—including alcohol. So stop by the local grocery store and pick up some cheap food for the journey.\n\nA Vast Rail Network and Multiple Trains\n\nEurope’s rail network is extremely vast so it is possible to travel to even small towns by train. Most destinations offer multiple trains a day. The most popular routes usually have multiple trains an hour so getting to where you want to go is rarely difficult.\n\nSleep On the Train and Extend Your Travel Time\n\nIf you’re traveling a long distance, consider taking an overnight train. These trains have special sleeper cars with bunks (usually six-bunk rooms or two-bunk rooms). A bunk in a sleeper car will cost about $45-$90 extra (about the same as a night in a hostel) but you won’t lose out on a whole day of travel. Overnight trains also have normal seats if you don’t want to fork over the extra cash for a bunk but it’s kind of uncomfortable.\n\nSpontaneous Travel\n\nTrain travel allows you to be spontaneous so you can show up at any train station, buy a ticket, and be on your way.\n\nBeautiful Views\n\nEurope has a lot of beautiful countryside so traveling by train is a great way to see some fantastic views.\n\nPeace and Quiet\n\nThe train is the perfect place to sit back and relax. There is something very peaceful about staring out the window as you ride silently at 170MPH through the European countryside. The train is also a good time to write a postcard to your friends and family, read a book, write in your journal (you’ll be glad you did), or continue planning your future travels.\n\nSome trains also offer designated quiet cars if you truly want quiet.\n\nComfort\n\nTrain seats are larger and more comfortable than plane seats (especially when compared to many discount airlines). You’re also free to move about the train whenever you feel like it. Many trains also have seats that face each other and have a table between the seats—so it’s great for groups.\n\nReliable and On Schedule\n\nEuropean trains run on schedule well over 90% of the time but flights are only on schedule around 65%.\n\nBeautiful Train Stations\n\nHistorically, train stations were the central hub for commerce and transportation so European cities showed off their status by building grandiose train stations. While it isn’t a huge deal, it is one of those nice little perks.\n\nYouth Discounts\n\nMany countries offer sizable discounts for people under 26 years old so don’t forget to look into those discounts.\n\nEnvironmentally Friendly\n\nThe train is the most environmentally friendly form of travel. In fact, even France banned short-haul flights to encourage more train travel within France.\n\nThe Train is Fun\n\nWe’ve always found riding the train to be fun. It’s oddly magical and relaxing.\n\nDisadvantages of Train Travel in Europe\n\nTrain travel isn’t perfect so here are a few things to watch out for:\n\nThe Cost\n\nTrain travel can be expensive—especially on high-speed trains. Furthermore, there are a lot of super-cheap flights throughout Europe so flying can often be cheaper.\n\nThat said, you can get some really good deals if you’re able to book high-speed trains in advance but you’ll pay a premium if you book last minute.\n\nThere are often discounts for travelers under 26 years old.\n\nSlow for Long-Distance Travel\n\nMany high-speed trains often travel between 150-180MPH but very long distances can still take quite a bit of time. Additionally, some long-distance routes might require the use of slower regional trains.\n\nFor example, taking the train from Paris straight to Budapest would take around 15 hours by train but only 2.5 hours by plane (plus, flying would be considerably cheaper).\n\nNote: Don’t forget to add in travel time to/from the airport and time to get checked in and through security—which will add around three hours to your journey.\n\nSlightly Confusing\n\nThe train schedules can be a little confusing—especially for beginners. Luckily, there are plenty of apps that help make the process much easier but we still get tripped up every now and then.\n\nMany cities have more than one train station (Paris has six!). It’s not uncommon to arrive at one station and leave from another.\n\nIt is also possible to change stations during a single journey. For example, when traveling from London to Lyon via the Eurostar, the Eurostar stops at the Paris North station, but then you have to travel to the Paris East station to catch the train from Paris to Lyon because there are no direct trains from London to Lyon. This transfer would require a cheap Métro (subway) ride.\n\nRail Strikes\n\nStriking is a national pastime in Europe. It happens a few times a year (or more if the people aren’t happy) but they announce the strikes well in advance so it shouldn’t be a surprise (just a hassle). You’ll just have to deal with them if they happen.\n\nPre-Trip Train Journey Planning\n\nThere are a number of great websites that will help you plan your train journey.\n\nThe first is Rome2Rio — simply plug in your destinations and it will give you all the train routes (as well as plane, bus, and car routes with cost estimates and travel times) for your journey. Rome2Rio is good for comparing different modes of transportation but I find better train ticket prices and more complete train listings on Omio and Trainline.\n\nThe German Railways Website (Bahn.de) shows the schedule of every train in Europe (yes, every train). We find that it’s helpful for piecing together complex train journeys. But it’s also good for seeing which trains require reservations and other important information. Unfortunately, you can only book German train tickets on the site so hop over to Omio and Trainline to book your tickets.\n\nI’ve also written a few country-specific train guides to help you learn the quirks of each country’s rail network.\n\nBelgium Train Guide\n\nEngland Train Guide\n\nFrance Train Guide\n\nGermany Train Guide\n\nItaly Train Guide\n\nNetherlands Train Guide\n\nPortugal Train Guide\n\nSpain Train Guide\n\nSwitzerland Train Guide\n\nHow to Buy European Train Tickets\n\nBuying European train tickets can be a little complicated—especially when you’re looking for the best deals.\n\nThat’s because each country runs its own National rail service (many countries also have separate private rail networks as well) and each does things slightly differently.\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of online tools to make the whole process easier and we’ll walk you through the process.\n\nNOTE: I’ve written an in-depth guide on how to buy train tickets in Europe if you want a more detailed look at finding the cheapest train fare.\n\nHow To Understand Train Ticket Pricing\n\nBefore we get started, I need to explain the two main ways train tickets are priced—fixed price and variable price.\n\nVariable-Price Train Fares\n\nVariable Train Fares are always changing based on demand, the day of the week, the time of year, and the distance to the departure date. Essentially all high-speed trains operate on this pricing model.\n\nTo get the best price on high-speed train tickets it’s best to pre-book your tickets early—usually a few weeks in advance.\n\nIn general, the prices will continue to creep up as the departure date approaches—you’ll pay a fortune if you buy last minute.\n\nOf course, you lose flexibility when buying tickets in advance because the cheapest tickets are normally non-refundable/unchangeable\n\nFixed-Price Train Fares\n\nWith Fixed Train Fares, the price is solely determined by the distance traveled. This is most common on regional and slower trains. With this type of ticket, it doesn’t matter when you buy tickets because the price never changes.\n\nWhere To Buy European Train Tickets\n\nThere are two main ways to buy European train tickets—directly from each country’s National Rail Service (via their website or at the train station) or through a third-party train booking search engine like Omio and Trainline—I find these booking services to be much more user-friendly.\n\nThird-Party Train Ticket Booking Sites\n\nThere are quite a few advantages to buying your train tickets with third-party booking sites:\n\nBooking Complex or Multi-Country Routes\n\nThe advantage of booking with a third-party booking site is that it lets you book more complex multi-country/international train routes. Many National Rail Services have trouble booking international routes (i.e. going from France to Italy)—so they can’t always find the best deals or show all available routes.\n\nNo Credit Card Processing Issues\n\nMany of Europe’s National Rail websites still have issues processing foreign credit cards so it’s common for credit cards to be declined when booking. These third-party sites won’t have these issues.\n\nNo Weird Technical or Translation Issues\n\nWe’ve found that it’s common for Europe’s National Rail websites to be plagued with weird technical problems and overall poor user interfaces. Many times you’ll get kicked from the English version of the page to the local language in the middle of the booking process. These third-party booking websites take care of these issues.\n\nBetter Smartphone Apps\n\nThird-party booking services have much better smartphone apps than the clunky national rail service apps.\n\nOur Favorite Train Booking Websites\n\nOmio: Omio is a great train booking engine that lets you book tickets from just about every country’s rail service and they make the booking process very user-friendly.\n\nTrainline: Trainline is a new European train booking service (very similar to Omio) that sells train tickets from Austrian, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and German Railways railways (and a few others).\n\nNational Booking Sites\n\nDespite their technical issues, sometimes the cheapest tickets can only be found by booking directly with each country’s national rail service. This is because sometimes they offer limited-time deals that third-party booking sites don’t have access to. So it doesn’t hurt to at least take a look.\n\nLinks to Some National Railway Websites:\n\nAustrian Railways¹ – Belgian Railways¹ – Danish Railways – Finnish Railways – French Railways – German Railways – Irish Railways – Italian Railways – Spanish Railways – Netherlands Railways¹ – Norwegian Railways – Polish Railways – Swedish Railways – Swiss Railways¹ – United Kingdom Railways\n\n¹ Domestic tickets (i.e. trips that are wholly within the country) are always the same price — regardless of when they’re purchased and they never require a reservation. Therefore, it is easiest to buy tickets at the station. However, these countries often have a separate international high-speed train system (e.g., Belgium has slower regional trains and high-speed Thalys trains that link major Belgian cities to other international cities — these tickets should be purchased early for cheaper fares).\n\nQuick Note About Eastern Europe Trains\n\nSome Eastern European countries still don’t have online ticket booking so it’s only possible to purchase tickets at the station or through a local travel agent. Ask your hostel or hotel and they’ll tell you where to locate an agent.\n\nReceiving Your Online Tickets\n\nThere are multiple ways to collect your tickets after you purchase them:\n\nElectronic Tickets: Many times you can have an electronic ticket sent to your phone (either via email or the booking app). Simply show the conductor on the train when he checks tickets and he’ll scan the QR code on the screen. This isn’t available in all countries but most countries have switched to eTickets.\n\nPrint-At-Home Tickets: Anywhere that offers electronic tickets will usually let you print tickets at home. You can often simply save the PDF to your phone/tablet and the conductor can scan it from there.\n\nPick Up At the Station: Use your credit card or a booking number to print your tickets at the train station ticket machines.\n\nNote: You’re often required to use the SAME credit card use to purchase the tickets to collect the tickets at the station.\n\nBuying Tickets At The Station\n\nYou can buy train tickets at any train station—either from the ticket window or from automated ticket machines. We recommend trying the automated ticket machines since the lines at the ticket window are long, slow, and understaffed.\n\nWhen To Buy Train Tickets To Get The Best Price\n\nFares are fixed for most regional and local trains so there is no reason to buy them early.\n\nFor high-speed trains, it’s best to buy tickets early to get the cheapest tickets. In most cases, train tickets can be purchased 60-90 days before the departure date but buying a few weeks early is usually fine.\n\nTrain Ticket Price Examples (Comparing Last Minute vs Buying Early)\n\nParis to Nice\n\nPurchased Two Days Before Departure: €69.00\n\nPurchased Three Weeks Before Departure: €55\n\nParis to Amsterdam\n\nPurchased Two Days Before Departure: €135\n\nPurchased Three Weeks Before Departure: €97\n\nPurchased Six Weeks Before Departure: €54\n\nLondon to Paris (Eurostar Train)\n\nPurchased Two Days Before Departure: €234\n\nPurchased Three Weeks Before Departure: 124\n\nPurchased Six Weeks Before Departure: €55\n\nAs you can see, booking just a few weeks early can save quite a bit of money.\n\nQuick Point About Buying Train Tickets Early: As stated above, buying tickets in advance is the best way to save money but this also limits your ability to be flexible/spontaneous. This is especially true since many of the truly cheap train tickets are non-refundable. For optimum flexibility, it might be best to buy a rail pass. Here’s my Guide To Using Rail Passes in Europe and my Eurail Pass Review.\n\nOther Train Ticket Discounts\n\nMost rail services offer various discounts—some are based on rider age but other discounts are based on region, the day of the week, or other schemes.\n\nYouth Discount\n\nThe most common discount is a youth discount — which is usually for people under 27 years old.\n\nCountry-Specific Discounts\n\nMost countries offer a number of potential discounts. For example, Germany has a Schönes-Wochenende-Ticket (Happy Weekend Ticket) where groups of 2-5 people can ride as much as they want on regional trains from Saturday to Sunday for €44. Check each country’s rail service website to see if there are discounts available.\n\nEurail Passes\n\nMany travelers choose to use rail passes instead of buying individual tickets. That’s because Eurail passes can save you a bit of money (depending on how you use them) but most importantly they give you excellent flexibility by allowing you to travel without needing to plan.\n\nNote: We’ve written a lot about Eurail Passes. Check out our Guide To Using Rail Passes in Europe and our Eurail Pass Review for more in-depth information.\n\nQuick Rundown On Rail Passes\n\nA rail pass (aka Eurail Pass) is a single ticket/pass that allows you to ride any train in Europe—simply hop on, show the conductor your pass, and you’re good to go. Actually, it’s not quite that easy these days as there are a few stipulations, but the general idea is that you can ride any train without booking individual tickets.\n\nTypes Of Rail Passes\n\nGlobal Pass\n\nContinuous: Unlimited travel to any Eurail participant country for between 15 days and 3 months.\n\nFlexi: 10 or 15 individual travel days (doesn’t have to be consecutive days) to any Eurail participant country within a two-month period.\n\nSelect Pass:\n\nBetween 5 and 15 travel days in a two-month period, but you’re limited to traveling to 3, 4, or 5 bordering countries. These passes are good if you have a group of countries you’re interested in visiting.\n\nFor example, one pass could be 10 days of train travel between France, Switzerland, and Italy. You have a two-month window to use of your 8 travel days. Each day you travel by train counts as one travel day but you can take unlimited train rides within each day.\n\nSingle-Country Pass:\n\nEight travel days in a single country which must be used within a month.\n\nAdvantages of Rail Passes\n\nFlexibility: The number one benefit of rail passes is the flexibility they offer. You simply have to walk onto the train and go. That’s why this is a great option for people who don’t want to plan and who would rather wander across Europe.\n\nLong-Distance Trains: It’s also a good deal if you plan on taking a lot of long-distance trips because those tickets tend to be expensive so a rail pass is a good way to save some money. On the other hand, if you’re taking a bunch of short train rides then you’ll probably be better off buying single tickets.\n\nLow Stress: Piecing together a bunch of train journeys and then pre-purchasing individual tickets is stressful and takes a lot of time and planning. For a lot of people, paying a little extra for a rail pass is worth the hours saved having to preplan your entire trip.\n\nDisadvantages of Rail Passes\n\nMore Expensive: It’s usually cheaper if you purchase your train tickets online a few weeks in advance. That said, most of these cheap pre-purchased tickets are non-refundable so you’ll lose most of your flexibility. However, if you’re purchasing your train tickets a few days before departure then it’s much cheaper to use a rail pass.\n\nReservations: A few countries require rail pass holders to pay extra for a seat reservation on high-speed trains. The fee can range from anywhere from €5-€35 and they have to be made in advance — they can sometimes be made online or directly at the train station. Here’s a detailed guide to rail pass reservation requirements from eurail.com. You can also enter your journey into Bahn.de and it will tell you if that specific journey requires a reservation.\n\nNavigating The Train Station\n\nOk, now we know how to buy train tickets and rail passes… so let’s learn about what to expect when you get to the train station.\n\nThe train station is the central transportation hub of most European cities so things can be a little chaotic and confusing—especially if you’re not used to traveling by train.\n\nIn this section, I’ll give you some tips to help you find your train.\n\nNavigating The Train Station\n\nFirst, make sure you have the correct train station because many cities have multiple stations. For example, Paris has six stations. Even some small towns have two different stations.\n\nOnce you arrive at the station, you’ll see signage in English so you shouldn’t have much trouble finding your way. Some stations are huge so you may have to walk quite a bit and navigate stairs and escalators.\n\nDepending on the size of the station, you’ll also find fast food, cafes, shopping, lounges, and restrooms (although you sometimes have to pay to use them). Also, most train stations have luggage lockers that you can rent if you need them.\n\nPickpockets and Scams at the Train Stations\n\nTrain stations can get very busy, hectic, and full of confused tourists so they’re a common target for pickpockets and other scammers. Pay attention to your stuff and be wary of “helpful” strangers willing to help you with the ticket machines. Check out our Guide To Avoiding Pickpockets and Tourist Scams in Europe.\n\nTrain Ticket Machines\n\nIf you need to buy your train tickets or print your pre-purchased tickets you’ll want to first head to the automated ticket machines. Everything is in English and the machines are easy to use.\n\nAlternatively, you can still go to the ticket window or customer service desk but the lines are usually long.\n\nReading The Train Station’s Departure Board\n\nOnce you arrive at the station you’ll want to look for the departure board. There are usually multiple boards throughout the station and one giant main board. This board tells you where to find your train, when it leaves, and where it’s going.\n\nThe three most important things to note are the train number, departure time, and the platform.\n\nYour train ticket will show the scheduled departure time and the train number but it usually won’t show which platform the train leaves from.\n\nSo head to the departure board and find your train number to see at which platform your train is located. It’s very common for the departure board to not display the platform until 10-15 minutes before departure so pay attention to the board.\n\nFind Your Train’s Platform\n\nOnce know what platform your train is departing from you’ll want to find that platform at the station. Sometimes the platforms are a bit hard to find so you might have to seek them out.\n\nDon’t worry if there isn’t a train there at the moment because trains often pull in, load up, and leave.\n\nThere are usually a few staff members milling about on each platform so don’t be afraid to ask train station staff as most can speak English.\n\nValidate Your Ticket\n\nMany physical train tickets need to be validated (stamped with time/date) before entering the train so look for small validation boxes near the entrance of the platforms. Simply place your ticket inside the machine and it will stamp it.\n\nYou can receive a large fine if the ticket checker sees that your ticket isn’t validated (they’ll assume you were trying to ride for free). If you forgot, quickly seek out the conductor, explain that you forgot to validate and everything should be fine. Or you can just play the “I’m a dumb tourist and these scary trains confuse me” card and hope they let it slide.\n\nNote: Electronic tickets don’t need to be validated because they’re usually only good for the specific time stated on your ticket. Some paper tickets also don’t need to be validated but we usually try doing it anyway to be safe.\n\nFinding Your Train Car\n\nOn some trains (usually high-speed trains) you have assigned seats so look at your ticket to see which train car your seat is in. The car number will be displayed on the side of each train car.\n\nYou can board the train in any car but it’s much easier if you enter your car (walking through multiple train cars is a pain).\n\nMost regional and slower trains don’t have assigned seats so you can simply board anywhere you like.\n\nThat said, you’ll want to get on fairly quickly because trains are usually only at the station for a few minutes before they leave.\n\nOn The Train\n\nYou’ve made it on the train. Congratulations! In this section, we’ll talk about settling in and a few things you might experience on your ride.\n\nFind Your Seat & Store Luggage\n\nFind your assigned seat (if you have one) or take any free seat if it’s open seating. The seat numbers are displayed above the seats.\n\nTake the opportunity to store your luggage. Smaller luggage like backpacks and some suitcases can be stored above your seat on luggage racks. There are usually larger spaces for bigger luggage at the end of each train car.\n\nWait For The Conductor To Check Your Tickets\n\nA ticket checker will come by and check your ticket after the journey starts—typically within 10-20 minutes after departure.\n\nWhile not extremely common in Western Europe, border patrol might board the train to check passports. They might ask you some questions but we usually only encountered this in Eastern Europe.\n\nEnjoy The Ride\n\nOne of the great things about train travel is the comfort of the ride. Feel free to walk about, check out the bar car, enjoy a picnic (alcohol is allowed), or sleep. Some trains offer free wifi but we’ve never had much luck getting it to actually work.\n\nDeparting The Train\n\nOne of the most confusing parts of the ride is knowing exactly when to leave the train. That’s because train stations are sometimes named very similarly.\n\nFor example, many trains coming into Brussels first stop at the Brussels Nord station (which is located on the outskirts of town) before stopping at the main Brussels Centrale station (which is located in the center of town).\n\nMore Europe Travel Tips From The Savvy Backpacker\n\nI have a lot more tips and tricks for traveling through Europe on a budget.
