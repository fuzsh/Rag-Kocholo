        "text": "Is this trip originating from the Milano Centrale train station? You’ll need to watch the Departures board to see which track (binario) your train is using -it’ll post it a few minutes before the train arrives - the track isn’t necessarily always the same, but it’s really not difficult to deal with. You’ll wait in an open area facing the end of each train track, which are in numerical order from left to right. The ends of the tracks at each end of the row (1, 2, 3, and 22) are recessed a bit - more of a walk.\n\nAre you familiar with validating train tickets? If you ordered yours online, you may not need to, but usually, you have to time- and date-stamp them in one of the boxes provided in the station.\n\nEdited to add: There will be station personnel around, so you can always ask when in doubt.\n\nNo, Varenna-Esino is an intermediate station. The train’s final terminal station is TIRANO. So when you depart from Milano Centrale look for train going to TIRANO.\n\nREG. 2818 is scheduled to depart from track no. 9 from Milano Centrale however you should always check the departures displays or the big electronic board when you get to the station as departure tracks sometimes change just like departure gate changes sometimes occur with airplanes.\n\nI haven’t checked which track number it will arrive at Varenna. But it doesn’t really matter, there are only a couple of tracks at that small station. Just know that, like in France and Belgium, in Italy trains travel on the left track (just like cars in England). In Germanic speaking countries they travel on the right, go figure.\n\nI think that Those countries who learnt directly from Queen Victoria's engineers how to build and conduct their trains kept on running their railway systems \"the English Way\".\n\nI know, This would imply that the French for once in their history admitted they have learnt something new from those strange Islanders living up there where it rains. A flaw in my theory as big as their ego...\n\nOne thing about getting off the train at Varenna-Esino: know which is the previous station to it, and get up and be standing by the exit doors well before the train arrives at Varenna-Esino.\n\nThe first time we were there, we didn't, and had to really scramble to get off the train before the doors closed and it was off to the next station.\n\nIt only stops for a couple of minutes, so you need to be ready to get off as soon as it stops.\n\nBritish also provided some engineers when the Germans got into the railway game, but they caught on quick and had their own engineers when time came for dual track lines. Also it was not a national project at first, as Germany was a collection of independent states until 1871.\n\nIn France, I noticed that while trains run on the left, the Metros run on the right. Thus different platform directions for the RER and the Metro. I don't recall if this is the case in Milan as I have not ridden there enough to notice.\n\narrives in Varenna 10:24, leaves 10:25!\n\nIn their dreams... maybe a deserted train calling at Varenna-Esino at 11 AM in February could arrive and depart in one minute. It takes only one car with more than 3 people getting off with luggage to unload and departing in one minute becomes impossible.\n\nAnyway for now Trenitalia's conductors do not get paid by the number of customers smashed on the platforms. When you realize only at the last second that you have arrived at your destination, there is a simple way to avoid the problem: one hurries to the exit and stays very close the car's door, waiting for the other to carry all their luggage and unload it.\n\nIn short, conductors can't \"whistle green\" to the train engineer when they see there is people too close to one of the train's doors for some reason.\n\nYou could stay on the steps and trust the fail-safe, but I trust angry humans more than cold devices. And the red face of an overweight, unionized ,60 something male train conductor running towards you and crying \"Wtf is stopping my train?????\" Priceless! One of the reason I try to avoid travelling with Italotreno is their polite, always-smiling staff that's always trying to be helpful.\n\nDario,\n\nyou have such slow station calls on your Regionale..\n\nOver 20 years I worked British railways and if nobody has opened a door then on a commuter train 20 to 30 seconds is standard or even slow to press the close button. If there is a large group entering or leaving, especially on Saturday or Friday night, or after football I would stretch to 90 seconds or two minutes unless we were early. If we were early I'd wait until the correct time. Time for a nice stroll along the platform.\n\nBut regularly more than one minute, no.\n\nThe fast trains stop a little longer. (I'm talking 125 MPH (200 kPH) for the longer stops of a couple of minutes or so, depending on the schedule.\n\nyou have such slow station calls on your Regionale.\n\nWell Sir, after all you invented the Railways. I also suspect that British customers Carry less suitcases per person than their Italian counterparts.\n\nwe did purchase them on the Rome2Rio site\n\nYou have got me curious, so I tried to purchase a train ticket for tomorrow on the English version of Rome2Rio.com . I am a little ashamed, I don't know why, but and it keeps on showing a \"No train tickets found\" message."
