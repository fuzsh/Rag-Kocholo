This UNESCO World Heritage city is a wow.\n\nDubrovnik Old City Map\n\n10 Things To Do and See in Dubrovnik\n\nDubrovnik old city walls\n\nStroll the Stradun promenade\n\nDubrovnik Romantic Restaurants\n\nVisit Dubrovnik Rector’s Palace\n\nDubrovnik Summer Festival.\n\nTake a trip to Lokrum island\n\nVisit Aquarium and Maritime Museum\n\nSwimming and sunbathing on Dubrovnik beaches\n\nWedding in Dubrovnik\n\nTake a day tour to Konavle and Cilipi village\n\nDubrovnik Day Trip Ideas:\n\nDon’t just stay locked in your apartments. Consider making your vacation an active one, and take a few day trips to learn more about our history, culture, heritage, or participate in some adrenaline adventures and activities.\n\nBelow are a few ideas to get you started!\n\nMake sure you also check all my articles about Dubrovnik to learn more about this fantastic destination! I also have a few great day trip ideas at the end of this guide so scroll down!\n\nDubrovnik Photo Slideshow:\n\nDubrovnik Accommodation Guide\n\nDubrovnik Croatia is far from being a cheap destination regardless of the type of accommodation you are looking for. Together with Hvar town, it is in fact the most expensive.\n\nWhen I say this town is expensive, I am referring to the period of high season (July and August) and to hotel accommodation. In addition to high prices, huge amount of visitors and at times unbearable crowds is another problem you will face if you decide to be there in high season.\n\nYou should definitely make reservations in advance. It’s essential as hotels and private accommodation can get can booked out quickly from June to September.\n\nIf you find difficulties, as an alternative you should consider the coast between Dubrovnik and Cavtat known as the “Dubrovnik Zupa” which is a prefect choice, particularly if you need to be close to the Dubrovnik airport. You can also find and affordable accommodation in “Dubrovnik Riviera” which is to the north of Dubrovnik town.\n\nIf you are planning to visit Dubrovnik in lower season, then the periods from May to June or September to October are the best. Not only you will find lower prices (sometimes 30% lower), but these periods are also far less crowded.\n\nDubrovnik Town Private Accommodation\n\nPrivate accommodation is the best value for your accommodation budget. In recent years the offers in private sector have been tripled in quality and number.\n\nAlthough the prices have increased in some places, many small inns, guesthouses, private rooms, apartments and hostels are still cheaper than staying in a hotel.\n\nPrivate accommodation has some pros and cons compared to hotels. Renting an apartment is a more economical choice for families or a group of friends. Most apartments are equipped with a kitchen and all necessary appliances, so if you want to cook it can save you a great deal money spent on food.\n\nIf you opt to rent only a room rather than a full apartment, you should be aware of the possibility of having to share the house with the proprietor’s family. You should also keep in mind that most owners will ask you for a minimum stay of two, three and even seven nights in the summer.\n\nIt’s also important to know that for payment you must always have cash, as in most cases the owners do not accept Credit Cards.\n\nDubrovnik Town Accommodation By Districts\n\nDubrovnik Croatia, Ploce gate district at the eastern end of the Old City is considered the most prestigious residential area of Dubrovnik.\n\nBeautiful gardens, charming villas, wonderful beaches and the best view of the Old Town. The most eminent hotels in Dubrovnik are located at Ploce. My favorite is Excelsior 5-stars hotel.\n\nMajority of visitors are looking to stay in Dubrovnik old town where you can find Stradun (pronounced [stra(du?n]) or Placa, the most famous street in Dubrovnik, with rich cultural heritage and the most important monuments. Search for private accommodation inside the city walls!\n\nDubrovnik old town is bounded by steep hills and several well known districts just 2,5 km away or a 10 minutes bus ride.\n\nPile and Ploce gate are the western and eastern entrance to the Old Town, the vibrant areas with tourist information centers and bus stations to get you around Dubrovnik.\n\nPloce hotels and private accommodation\n\nPile hotels, rooms and apartments\n\nVilla Orsula Ploce gemstone!\n\nVilla Orsula, a five stars boutique hotel, perfectly fits in Dubrovnik Croatia town’s natural and ancient charms.\n\nWith only 13 rooms, two of them suites, this luxury gem carved in stone hillside with a terrace overlooking the Adriatic Sea and the ancient walls is definitely worth considering.\n\nHotel has no pool but owns a private beach located in Ploce district, neighboring two mythical hotels: Grand Villa Argentina and Hotel Excelsior.\n\nPopular hotels in Ploce – See where others are staying!\n\nHotel Excelsior – 5 stars\n\nGrand Villa Argentina\n\nVilla Orsula\n\nVilla Dubrovnik\n\nVilla King\n\nVilla Odak\n\nVilla Glavic\n\nVilla Gloria\n\nCheap hostels and apartments:\n\nNeed to find more cheap hostels? Try Hostelworld, it has the largest selection!\n\nPloce Gate Guesthouse Miletic\n\nApartman Karmen\n\nRoom Casablanca\n\nApartment Rose Garden\n\nApartments Near Old Town\n\nFrom there you can go and explore the nearby Dubrovnik town neighborhood:\n\nLapad\n\nLapad is a residential district on the western side of Dubrovnik Croatia town. It is connected with Old Town with bus connections (bus NÂ° 6 and 4) running every 10 minutes.\n\nIn Lapad there is a vast selection of hotels and private accommodation, and the best Dubrovnik beaches are right at your fingertips.\n\nSearch hotels, apartments in Lapad!\n\nBabin Kuk\n\nBabin Kuk is a peninsula at the northern end of the Lapad, known for several five stars luxury hotels and Copacabana, Dubrovnik’s longest pebble beach.\n\nSearch hotels in Babin Kuk!\n\nIt is one of the greenest areas of Dubrovnik. Babin Kuk makes a great choice for families with children, seniors or beach lovers. Take a BUS LINE 6 Pile (Old Town) to Babin Kuk.\n\nCheck Valamar Croatia Dubrovnik hotels chain, a representative of international standard of quality service for a perfect holiday in Croatia.\n\nGruz\n\nGruz is the main Dubrovnik Croatia harbor. It has very good connections with the other parts of Dubrovnik by regular bus connections. Take a BUS LINE 8 Viktorija (Ploce) – Gruz.\n\nIf you are traveling to Dubrovnik by bus, your final bus station will be at Gruz Main Bus Station.\n\nSearch hotels in Gruz!\n\nAll ferries and catamarans to Elaphiti islands and island of Mljet are leaving from Gruz harbor.\n\nTop Rated Dubrovnik Croatia Apartments\n\nKarmen apartments – The best money can buy!\n\nBaltazar apartments – A real paradise!\n\nPervanovo Apartments – A great value for the money!\n\nLausion Apartments – Honeymooning in Dubrovnik!\n\nNije Presa Apartments – To feel really at home!\n\nApartments Dubrovnik Center – Absolutely wonderful!\n\nThe Secret Apartments – A gem of accommodation!\n\nApartments Placa Dubrovnik – Centrally located apartments!\n\nApartments Raic – Great apartments inside the walls!\n\nApartments Kovac – Location that counts!\n\nGreen Park Apartments – Great apartments with balcony!\n\nApartments Nadramija – Amazing view on Lokrum island!\n\nOrka Apartments – With lovely garden!\n\nDubrovnik Croatia Public Transport Map\n\nFrom the bus station, take buses:\n\n1a, 1b, 1c, 3 to Pile Gate\n\n1a, 1b, 1c, 3, 7 to Gruz harbor\n\n7 to Lapad and Babin Kuk\n\nThe best way to get around Dubrovnik is by local orange buses run by local Libertas Dubrovnik Company. In high season buses run from every 10 minutes to half hour.\n\nThe bus ticket costs â¬2 if you buy one from the bus driver (must have exact change), or â¬1.5 (at newspaper kiosks). Tickets are also available at most hotels receptions, travel agencies and main bus station (at Gruz district).\n\nDubrovnik Riviera And Zupa Guide\n\nIf you plan to visit Dubrovnik Croatia in high season (July and August) without booking in advance, you will probably face the problem in finding a suitable accommodation, either in hotels or in private accommodation.\n\nIn that case, Dubrovnik Riviera and Zupa are excellent alternatives to find cheaper accommodation and at the same time be close to Dubrovnik. To be more precise you need to differentiate Dubrovnik Riviera from Dubrovnik Zupa (Parish of Dubrovnik) because:\n\nDubrovnik riviera is a western area along the coast between Dubrovnik to Neum and Peljesac Peninsula, with small villages like Zaton, Orasac, Trsteno, Slano. The distance from Dubrovnik is from 8 km (Zaton) to 30 km (Slano).\n\nDubrovnik Zupa covers the area south of Dubrovnik, and includes small villages Kupari, Srebreno, Mlini, Plat and Cavtat. The distance from Dubrovnik to Cavtat is 22 km. Dubrovnik airport (Cilipi) is also located in this area.\n\nIf you want to avoid listening to airplanes constantly landing and taking off, you may want to consider staying in Riviera and not Zupa.\n\nAccommodation in Dubrovnik Zupa: browse accommodation offers in – Cilipi, Near Airport, Mlini, Plat, Cavtat.\n\nAccommodation in Dubrovnik Riviera: browse through accommodation offers in Slano, Trsteno, Orasac, Zaton.\n\nLocal bus connections:\n\nFrom Dubrovnik to Dubrovnik Zupa:\n\nBus Nr. 10 Dubrovnik – Cavtat.
