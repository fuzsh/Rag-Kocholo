Destination Highlights\n\nI encourage you to highlight the most visited landmarks on your home page with beautiful pictures and illustrations, and a few lines of text describing the place. This may include; famous tourist landmarks, cultural significant destinations, and other special activities that may be done in the destinations.\n\n2. Package Details\n\nI highly recommend including required information for each travel package such as travel detailing, services included/excluded in the cost, the prices and special discounts. Ensure you keep this information readily available and neatly organized in the website.\n\n3. Special Deals and Promotions\n\nInclude any special offers, discounts or any offers related to the business on the homepage or any specific page related to that business. I suggest using banners or pop-ups to direct attention to these offers.\n\nFocus on this, and you’ll be fine.\n\nPS: I suggest taking a look at the website examples below.
