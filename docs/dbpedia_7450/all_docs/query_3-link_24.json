At Alsa we offer bus rental, travel deals, on-board services and information on routes and schedules.\n\nFor sure they'll be a way to take the bus from the Bilbao airport to the bus station. If you can't find detailed information, maybe just ask when you get there. And if not plan that you have to take a cab. Buen Camino!\n\nEdit: but there is a transfer in San Sebastian. That's probably why it looks so complicated on Rome to Rio. When I have to make a bus or train transfer in places that I'm not familiar with, I use my cell phone to track my location. Because sometimes you can't understand them when they announce over the PA.\n\nLast edited: May 24, 2023\n\nWestKirsty\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nNext up: Viejo/Olvidado\n\nMay 24, 2023\n\n#12\n\nHi! I live here in Bilbao and have taken the airport bus many, many times. And I've also taken the bus to Pamplona, many times. Your first snapshot looks very strange to me.\n\nBasically, once you arrive at Bilbao airport and get off the plane, past the customs etc and to the arrivals area where people are waiting for loved ones, head to the right, following the bus signs. It's a small airport so the bus kiosk is very easy to find. You'll see the kiosk at the end of the departures area.\n\nThere are only 2 buses - one into Bilbao every 20-30 minutes depending on the time of year, and the other goes to San Sebastian. You can get your ticket at the kiosk and ask if you're not sure.\n\nThe last stop on the Bilbao bus is the main bus station - Intermodal. It's all underground now after being completely renovated a few years ago.\n\nBoth the Alsa and La Union buses leave from here - Intermodal - to go to Pamplona. Check their websites for timetables and if you want to purchase tickets in advance.\n\nIf you have other specific questions, feel free to message!\n\nMaxHelado\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPortugués 2022, 2023 & 2024; Frances 2023\n\nMay 24, 2023\n\n#13\n\nHi!

The bus from the airport stops where the busses for Pamplona depart, at the Bilbao Intermodal. It’s a biggish area with different platforms for the various buses - and I see from @WestKirsty‘s post that it is all underground now which it wasn’t when we passed through. Buen Camino!\n\nPS: Rome2Rio isn’t what it once was. I agree with @WestKirsty: that’s a weird map/timetable in your first post.\n\nVeronicaF1\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nWalked from Pamplona to Los Arcos, Planning to continue from Los Arcos\n\nMay 25, 2023\n\n#15\n\nGreat info, thank you.\n\nDo you know where these buses leave from?\n\nI think the bus from the airport comes into Bilbao Intermodal but I don't know if that is the main (or only?) bus station or if I need to allow for a schlepp across the city.\n\nThe airport shuttle goes to the bus station.
