        "text": "Rome2Rio is great for initial trip planning but it's not always accurate. I'd always go to the source to buy train tickets, if possible. I had no trouble using the Trenitalia app in May to buy train tickets with my phone as needed. You can register with Trenitalia if you like so you don't have to keep re-typing your name and info each time you buy tickets - but it requires generating a tax code that is probably never be used for anything.\n\nMore info on how to create that code here:\n\nhttp://www.italychronicles.com/how-to-create-a-codice-fiscale/\n\nSure, if you aren't comfortable buying train tickets on a phone, stick to buying the paper tickets at the stations. I use my phone because it saves me time - I don't have to wait in line at a machine, worry about validating tickets, etc. E.g. when I am day tripping in some Italian town and decide I want to come back on the next train in 30 minutes, I'll buy the ticket at that time on my phone and start heading back to the station. No uncertainty about the machines or waiting in line. No need to get back to the station earlier than I need to (except to make sure I get a seat on a regional train that could be crowded in some cases). And I just show my ticket to the conductor by showing him/her the ticket on my phone - he/she scans the QR code that is on my screen.\n\nYou don't have to validate tickets bought on your phone, because they are purchased for a specific time. Paper tickets bought at the station for regional trains are not for a specific time, so you DO need to validate them.\n\nAnother app to look at for train schedules is called Trenit - I did use that one too and do find the schedules there easier to read than on the Trenitalia app. Trenit shows tickets for Italo trains too, not just Trenitalia trains. It's possible to buy tickets using Trenit also.\n\nAlthough I use rome2rio quite frequently, to learn what bus/train/airline companies might offer possibilities for the journey I am planning, I have purchased tickets directly with trenitalia on-line many many times over the past ten years. I usually choose to purchase my longer distance (freccia - fast train) tickets from home, on my home computer, and print out my ticket while at home. (I'm just one of those who likes having a paper copy, although many folks are comfortable with e-tickets on their phones. However, see the thread just posted today about the woman who dropped her phone into the canal in Venice...!) I like using trenitalia.com because I find it easy to use, and will be the most dependably accurate for times, trains, etc., Purchasing my freccia train tickets weeks ahead of my trip also usually saves me much money, if I am able to get the reduced-fare advanced purchase price (like 30 euros instead of 60 euros!) These tickets also are only good for one train, and cannot be used on any other train. They also have assigned seats. However, when I'm going on short jaunts, like Assisi-Spello, Lucca-Pistoia, etc., these are \"regionale\" tickets, for the regional trains, with no seat assignments, and I usually purchase those from the ticket kiosks in the train stations. I've found the kiosks very easy to use; English is an option, and the tickets are good for 4 hours from the train time you have chosen. Just be SURE to validate your regionale tickets in the validation machines on or near the train platform, before getting on the train. The tickets printed from home don't need to be validated.\n\nI used the Trentitalia app on my phone (and their website on my PC) throughout our (wife and me) Aug-Sep 2019 Sicily to Milan trip. This was our first trip to Italy and first time using the app. Worked great to research and buy tickets. A few tickets I bought in US and printed out; others I researched in Italy and just showed the conductor (when asked) my on-phone ticket. No validation necessary, and avoided some long lines. Bought second- and first-class tickets; assigned seating and non-assigned seating.\n\nRometoRio is a site I use as a starting point to determine routes, though they don't capture possibility; however, I have never used them to purchase tickets.\n\nIf you know what time of day you want to travel, you can buy the tickets on-line from www.trenitalia.com at home and print them at home. I always purchase ours a few months ahead of our trip, so I can save money when their cheaper tickets are first available before theyâ€™re all sold. There may still be some available so good to check. Otherwise, you will pay more purchasing the tickets the day of travel, but you have more flexibility of what time to travel.\n\nI think there is some confusion statements made above. ALL trains in Italy (except Regionale trains) require a reservation so each tickets comes with specific seat assignment in a specific train at a specific day and time. The ticket is only good for that train at that time. So there is no need to validate (time stamp) those tickets because they are only good for one time.\n\nThe Regionale train ticket sold in the station or at a ticket machine is the sole exception and the only ticket that needs to be validated prior to usage. Since it is valid on any Regionale train that ticket must be validated (time stamp) just prior to the train departure and is good for four hours. Do not validate in the morning and try to use it that afternoon. When you purchase Regionale train tickets on-line you specified a starting time for that ticket and it is only good for four hours after the specified start time so that ticket does not need to be time stamped in the station.\n\nTo begin with, Rome2Rio. It has an extensive database for locations in many places around the world. IMO, It's a good website to provide general information on getting from one place to another, but for specific and detailed information in Italy it's better to use the rail company websites.\n\nAs the others have mentioned, it's only necessary to buy advance tickets for the express trains (Freccia, Intercity) if you can get the discounted rates. There's no cost advantage to buying advance tickets for Regionale trains, although you can certainly do that. You can easily buy tickets either at a staffed ticket window or from the automated Kiosks (which have English language menus - they're very easy to use but you MUST know the Italian names for the stations). If you buy Regionale tickets locally, these must be validated prior to boarding the train on the day of travel.

Don't forget as those with unvalidated tickets may face hefty fines which are collected on the spot!\n\nIf you wish to buy advance tickets for the express trains, you can either use the rail company websites or resellers such as Trainline, Loco2, Italiarail or others. I always use www.trainline.com as they sell tickets for numerous rail networks in Europe, including the two main operators in Italy (Trenitalia and Italo).\n\nYou may also find this short video helpful - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n8rITO1Eek .\n\nBuon Viaggio!"
