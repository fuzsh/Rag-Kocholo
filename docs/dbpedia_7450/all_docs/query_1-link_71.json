        "text": "In this post, we explain the weather in Rome during the month of November.\n\nAs both your tour guide and a retired meteorologist, I use my combined skills to offer reliable weather forecasts for this month.\n\nThis ensures you stay informed and ready for any weather scenarios during our tour.\n\nWe include average temperatures, how much rain to expect, as well as tips on what to pack.\n\nTemperatures\n\nSun and Rain\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nThings to Do\n\nWeather in October\n\nHow Hot is Rome in November?\n\nDaytime high temperatures tend to be around 18-19 C (65-67 F) early in the month but fall to near 14-16 C (58-61 F) by the end of the month.\n\nA few of the warmer afternoons, especially early in November, can reach up near 23 C (73 F).\n\nThe record high temperature in Rome during November is 30 C (86 F).\n\nLate night and early morning low temperatures tend to be near 9-10 C (48-50 F) early in the month, falling to around 6-8 C (43-46 F) near the end of the month.\n\nA few of the colder mornings, especially late in the month, can dip down near 1 C (34 F).\n\nThe record low temperature in Rome during November is -5 (23 F).\n\nSun and Rain\n\nDuring November, Rome will normally experience about 12 sunny, 2 partly sunny, and about 16 mostly cloudy days.\n\nAbout 8-10 days record some rainfall, however, only about 4 days will record rainfalls of 10 mm (0.4 inches) or more.\n\nDaylight\n\nThe number of daylight hours decreases this month from about 10.4 hours on the 1st to about 9.4 hours by the 30th.\n\nWindspeed\n\nThe wind speeds during this month are mostly light to gentle averaging 6-19 kph (4-12 mph), however, can occasionally be moderate at 20-28 kph (13-18 mph).\n\nOcean and Beaches\n\nWithin about an hour of the city are several good beaches.\n\nHowever, water temperatures will be a bit chilly this month, falling from about 20 C (68 F) early in the month to near 17 C (63 F) by the end of the month.\n\nWhat to Wear in Rome in November\n\nWeather in Rome during November becomes chilly, so a mix of Autumn and some winter attire is suggested.\n\nThis includes long skirts, long pants or jeans, a couple of sweaters, and at least one medium-weight jacket or coat for the colder nights and mornings.\n\nPlease bring along an umbrella for rainy days and donâ€™t forget some comfortable walking shoes.\n\nIf you plan to visit the Vatican, best to check their dress code first.\n\nThings to Do in Rome in November\n\nAlthough there will more than likely be quite a few cloudy days in November, there should also be several sunny days.\n\nDepending on when you visit, you might want to consider a pay-what-you-wish walking tour in Rome.\n\nIf you do end up visiting on a rainy day, consider heading to the Pantheon for an interesting visual experience, as the rain will fall (at a slightly decreased rate) inside the building!\n\nRoma Europa will still be in full swing this November, which means there should be several excellent theatrical performances to enjoy this month.\n\nAlternatively, you could also attend a concert of the Three Tenors or see the opera La Traviata, both of which are performed on a weekly basis at St. Paul's Within the Walls.\n\nFor even more ideas, make sure to check our full post covering things to do in Rome in November.\n\nFred Pickhardt\n\nOcean Weather Services"
