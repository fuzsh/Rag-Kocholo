        "text": "Testimonials\n\nWhat Our Clients Say About Us\n\nLuther Poier, CFO, BlueChilli Technology\n\n“MM Business Partners has been a true partner of ours for the last few years as we have grown and built our business. Monika and her team have been hugely responsive and their advice on bookkeeping and payroll operations has saved us time, worry and money all at once. I would highly recommend MM Business Partners for any new or growing business who wants first-class help to manage their day to day bookkeeping, receivables management and payroll.”\n\nDr Amantha Imber, CEO, Inventium\n\n“Monika has been Inventium’s bookkeeper for many years. She is the best we have had and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a fantastic bookkeeper with a great attention to detail.”\n\nBernhard Tschirren, Co-founder & Chief Architect, Rome2Rio\n\n“MM Business Partners have been our bookkeeper since 2013. Since then, our business has grown from three people to forty staff. Monika has done an exceptional job keeping up with the monthly reconciliation, diligently chasing up any mystery transactions that are so common with a growing business. She’s also worked closely with our accountants to ensure end of year financials are completed on time. I can enthusiastically recommend Monika and MM Business Partners.”\n\nYury Koryukin, Vice-President of ABBYY Australia, NZ and Japan\n\n“ABBYY in Australia has been using the accounting services of MM Business Partners over the last 5 years and we have consistently received good service and quality work from their team. I highly appreciate the thoroughness, confidentiality and professionalism of their services, especially in urgent or very complex situations. Working with MM Business Partners is such an outstanding experience that I sometimes forget I am outsourcing this function. If you are a company in need of excellent quality bookkeeping service that reflects positively on your firm, then look no further than MM Business Partners. Thanks for being so awesome!”\n\nLachlan Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer, HealthKit and Halaxy\n\n“Monika and MM Business Partners have been an invaluable asset to our business from the early days in our business establishment, through to our international scale and expansion. All the work is prompt, thorough and really comprehensive on all fronts.”\n\nBart Wolkowski, Director, Redwolf + Rosch | Digital, IT, Sales & Marketing Recruitment Specialists\n\n“We have worked with Monika from MM Business partners for over 2 years now and have found her to be fantastic to work with. She is always on top of the latest information that we need to be aware of and brings important issues to my attention that may otherwise have been overlooked. Great with numbers and detail orientated, she goes above and beyond, often rising to an unexpected challenge and coming up with solutions or new and better ways of working. A Xero expert, she is well connected and gets quick responses when Xero customer service is slow to respond. She has never missed a payroll or a submission deadline in all the time we have worked together (no matter where in the world she may be) and always responds to communication in a timely manner. She is personable and has a proactive and winning, “can do” attitude which is so valuable in a business partner. I can not recommend Monika and MM Business partners highly enough. They are exceptional!”\n\nFranki Chamaki, COO & Co-founder, HIVERY\n\n“We have been working with MM Business Partners and Monika for several years, and during this time we have found Monika extremely professional. She manages reconciliation and our reporting obligations very well, she is very responsive to our queries and just a pleasure to deal with. I would recommend MM Business Partners and Monika for your bookkeeping needs.”\n\nJason Hosking, Founding Director & CEO, HIVERY\n\n“MM Business Partners are simply awesome. We recently changed accountants who tried to sell us their own internal bookkeeping team. Later they turned to me and said, “Great idea to stick with Monika – she is the best bookkeeper I’ve ever seen!”\n\nJacques Bousejaan, Director, Kontract Design\n\n“Kontract have been using MM Business Partners’ bookkeeping services for the past 5 years and it has been an absolute pleasure. Director Monika tends to go above and beyond the general bookkeeping services and she always has a ‘can do’ attitude. I couldn’t imagine being on top of my business accounts without the help of Monika and the team at MM Business Partners. Monika was highly recommended to us and I would definitely recommend her services to other small, medium or large companies.”\n\nFelicity Grey, Managing Director, Theory Crew Pty Ltd\n\n“Theory Crew engaged MM Business Partners to manage our payroll and general bookkeeping in 2016. We are extremely happy with the service Monika provides. She is reliable and efficient, providing exceptional attention to detail and expert advice when needed. Monika uses initiative and is easy to communicate with. We recommend Monika to anyone seeking expert bookkeeping services.”\n\nPeter David, Co-founder & CEO, Keaz Australia\n\n“I wish to share the outstanding and professional accounting services and monthly salary management Monika at MM Business Partners has provided Keaz Australia during the past few years. As our volume of transactions had not warranted a full time accountant until very recently, MM’s service constantly filled a need for our operations. And though we recently took on the services of a full time accountant, we’ve found the work Monika provides in salary administration to be exemplary, so we’ve keep this function with MM Business Partners. They really do provide a business partnering function.”\n\nHelen Barclay, Managing Director, EnviroDNA\n\n“A big thanks to Monika for all her help these last couple of years. Our business and our sister business has been able to rely on Monika to ensure our books are in order. She has proven to be reliable, punctual in her tasks and flexible. Monika is a good communicator, willing to help us understand matters and discuss issues with our accountant, whilst guiding us with her expertise. It is clear that Monika cares about her clients and doing a good job.”\n\nCaitlin West, Founder & Director, Calmer Sutra Tea\n\n“We have been working with MM Business Partners for 8 years now and would never consider going elsewhere for bookkeeping services. Monika is very helpful, has great attention to detail and is always timely with deadlines. Working with her has been a pleasure and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her business.”\n\nDavid Silver, Director, Benchmark Financial Services\n\n“We have been working with Monika for many years and would have no hesitation in highly recommending her (which we have, in fact, already done to a high growth retail business.) Monika is very proactive and responsive to any requests that we send her way. We will continue to work with Monika for a long time to come.”\n\nGet In Touch\n\nFor more information or a commitment-free discussion, please contact us:\n\n\n\nCaulfield, VIC 3162\n\n\n\nMonika: (+61) 423 336 267\n\nMichael: (+61) 422 287 899\n\n\n\nEmail Us"
