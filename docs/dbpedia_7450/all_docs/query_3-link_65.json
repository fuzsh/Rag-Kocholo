        "text": "Apps are definitely becoming more popular than websites when it comes to convenience — after all, mobile apps are easier to use and they often offer a better user experience too. Naturally, when it comes to travel, you will be needing the best travel apps if you’re looking to save time, money, and effort!\n\nNow, of course, there are TONS of travel apps out there and I know that the last thing you need is another useless app that will just clutter up your smartphone‘s screen and space.\n\nThat’s why with this guide, I am giving you the best of the best ‘virtual helpers‘ that will enhance every travel experience. Right from the planning stages and up to the actual trip itself, all of the travel apps listed below have been super helpful in my past adventures through all the 7 continents in the world — from city sprees to nature treks, etc.— so I bet that it would help you too!\n\nWhat’s more? I’ve included alternatives as well as “hidden gem” options that are beyond the typical international travel apps that you have already heard of.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nMust-Have Travel Apps\n\n» Travel Apps for Flights «\n\nThe usual favorites when it comes to booking the best flight deals are SkyScanner and Kayak (both of these popular websites have their own app counterparts); but, if you want to find out the “hidden gems”, check out the following travel apps:\n\n1. Hopper\n\nThis is one of the best travel apps for flights given its high accuracy for price prediction that’s based on vast historical data! Right from the moment that you search a flight route, Hopper will show you a color-coded calendar to show you the cheapest and most expensive dates to fly — the beauty of the app is that once you choose a time frame, it will advise you whether you should book it NOW or wait until prices dip.\n\nIf you choose the latter, you can set up a notification so that Hopper will ping you when the price is at its lowest. Ain’t that swell?\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ You can also do a price watch for hotels all over the world\n\n~ Recommendations on travel deals based on your trip history\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n– – –\n\n2. Timeshifter\n\nTake the guesswork out when trying to avoid or reduce your jet lag woes with Timeshifter! Developed in partnership with world-renowned scientists, you’ll get a personalized jet lag plan based on circadian rhythm neuroscience so that you can arrive at your destination in the best shape possible. This plan will be based on your sleep pattern, flight plan, and other personal preferences.\n\nBesides, not all trips are the same, the same way every person is unique so a personalized plan is definitely a must-have. To date, the first jet lag plan will be offered for FREE, and the next ones can be purchased individually or by subscription.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ Has a Practicality Filter™ feature that adjusts advice to the “real world”\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n– – –\n\n3. LoungeBuddy\n\nYou don’t need a membership nor a business class ticket to view, book, and access airport lounges! Without paying a fortune, LoungeBuddy is one of the most useful travel apps especially if you’re on a long-haul flight or layover because you can simply pick a lounge and book an entry for only a one-time fee. After all, I’m sure you’ll be needing a shower room and a space to eat and sit/sleep comfortably as you pass the time away.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ You can find out what airport lounges you can access for FREE or a one-time fee based on your trip, class, or credit card you possess\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS\n\n.\n\nALTERNATIVES: Since LoungeBuddy only accepts payments from cards under American Express, you can check out Priority Pass or LoungeKey instead\n\n– – –\n\n4. App in the Air\n\nThis might just be the one travel app where you can manage all your boarding passes, itineraries, and frequent-flyer programs. To add, it will even show you current wait times for check-in to your flight along with customs and security checks so that you can manage your time well at the airport (in fact, it will even show you places to eat, WiFi passwords, etc. to fill up your time).\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ Through augmented reality, App in the Air can help advise you if your carry-on is within the size limits for your flight\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n• • •\n\n» Itinerary Travel Apps «\n\nWith the following travel apps, you can easily research for your trip as well as organize your day-by-day travel itineraries with ease and minimal effort!\n\n5. Guides by Lonely Planet\n\nYou can never go wrong with Lonely Planet’s guides and content. As of this moment, they have a paid subscription model in the app to access their up-to-date advice, BUT fret not — they offer 5 FREE previews per month without a subscription along with some other cities that can be accessed for free, so it’s still a nifty travel app to have on your smartphone.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ Scan barcodes of Lonely Planet books you already have to access content for FREE on the app\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n– – –\n\n6. TripAdvisor\n\nFor sure, you have heard of TripAdvisor and I bet that you have used its website numerous times now! If you want to collect all the tips that you loved from their website, just use their app instead because, for instance, you can easily organize all the ‘things to do‘ that you want to accomplish for your trip. You can even start booking your accommodation, flights, and activities straight from the Trip Advisor app as well!\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ You’ll get more insight into certain activities and establishments given the millions of reviews and photos that travelers worldwide have contribute to the platform\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n– – –\n\n7.

PackPoint\n\nIf you’re like me who tends to be veeeery forgetful, PackPoint should definitely become your new pre-travel buddy! Through this travel app, you will never forget your travel essentials again. Ever.\n\nBesides, PackPoint is an intelligent packing app that builds a list of the things you need based on your length of travel, type of travel (business or leisure) your destination’s weather, and your planned activities.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ You’re free to edit the suggested list they build for you as well as save it for future similar trips\n\n~ There is a ‘Repeat Basics’ and ‘Laundry’ feature that you can turn on or off as they build a packing list for you\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n.\n\nALTERNATIVES: Check out Travel List or Packr\n\n• • •\n\n» Navigation & Transportation Travel Apps «\n\nAside from the usual ones that we all know by now such as…\n\nRidesharing Apps: Uber, Grab, or Lyft\n\nNavigation App: Google Maps (with its very nifty offline feature!)\n\n…here are some other transportation-related travel apps you MUST check out!\n\n9.

CityMapper\n\nIf Rome2Rio covers worldwide, CityMapper is rather specialized in finding the best routes within the cities that they want to focus on (which are fewer but definitely more comprehensive). To see a full list of the cities that they cover, go here.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ Has LIVE wait times and ETA so you’ll never miss your ride\n\n~ Some maps can be accessed offline for use\n\n~ Provides additional tips such as the best carriage to board and best exits, as well as be alerted when it’s time to get off\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n– – –\n\n11.

Waze\n\nGoogle Maps has a lot of amazing features and it’s also the most accurate, BUT if you want a similar travel app that has LIVE community-based prompts such as police traps, sudden road hazards, accident reports, and traffic updates, Waze is a great alternative!

Flush\n\nFlush Toilet Finder is one of the best travel apps that will help you find the quickest way to the neared public bathroom or restroom! With its huge community, users can even rate and report a toilet; and you, yourself, can add a tip or new location. If you ask me, when I’m traveling, I just go to the nearest hotel because they often have nice lobby restrooms that are free to use! *wink*\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ Can be used offline\n\n~ Shows toilets that have disabled access, a fee, or require a key\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n– – –\n\n26. GlobeTips\n\nTipping is one of my biggest travel woes (especially because I hate anything related to math lol).

With their easy-to-use app, GlobeTips will give you precise advice on how you can tip well based on a specific situation.\n\nWith data on tipping customs in over 240+ countries, you’ll get the best advice possible (e.g. like how you do NOT need to tip in Japan, etc.).\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ It also has bill scanning so that it can automatically calculate everything for you\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS\n\n– – –\n\n27. HappyCow\n\nThis is, unfortunately, not a free app — BUT I feel the need to include it here since it is quite helpful. I’m not a vegetarian but for those who are, this app only costs $3.99 and it is the best application for finding all vegan-options for restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores all over the world!

XE Currency\n\nApart from foreign languages, foreign currencies can be a pain whenever you travel! Add the fact that there are constant currency fluctuations in the market, so it’s very difficult to be consistently on-the-dot with exchange rates — unless of course, you have XE Currency with you.\n\nThe best part? You can also quickly send money overseas based on the live exchange rates that they have whilst also having the feature to track the transfer.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ You can view currency charts in the last 10 years\n\n~ You can set alerts for your chosen currencies when it hits your target rate\n\n~ It offers LIVE currency rates, charts, and even stores the last updated rates, so it works offline (the rates will not be refreshed at that point, but they are still very close to the accurate value)\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS / Android\n\n– – –\n\n29. Trail Wallet\n\nI adore Trail Wallet. It’s certainly one of my favorite travel apps especially when it comes to tracking travel expenses.

You can also set yourself a daily budget limit and then easily add expenses as you go.\n\nWHY I LOVE IT:\n\nDesigned for ease and fast use, whenever you incur an expense, you can just simply launch the app, add the amount using its ‘Quick Add’ screen and you’re done! It’s a no-frill experience so you don’t have to spend so much time on it while you’re on the road.\n\nYou can set categories, themes, colors, breakdowns, etc. And at the end of your trip, you will have interactive + comprehensive charts and reports showing how your spending behavior went.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots above, the app’s interface is very modern and organized. Plus, it has fun customizable characters that will alert you if you’re ever going over your budget. (And would even coax you to relax if you’re under your budget).\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS\n\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE TO LOVE?\n\n~ It can also show the data in any of your local currencies\n\n~ Modern and organized interface where you can customize your categories and colors\n\n~ There are interactive and comprehensive charts showing how your spending behavior went\n\n~ Free for the first 25 items, with an In-App Purchase available to unlock unlimited amounts\n\n.\n\nDOWNLOAD: iOS\n\n– – –\n\n30.
