        "text": "This weekend I went to San Miguel de Allende in Guanajuato, Mexico. I’ve heard great things about this little town in the middle of nowhere. So, how do you get there? How do you get anywhere, for that matter? I used Rome to Rio.\n\nRome to Rio is a website that’s like Google Maps but better. For example, it will tell you to take a bus to a plane to a bus to another bus.\n\nAll this might sound overwhelming until you look at each piece.\n\nLet’s consider my trip to San Miguel de Allende. I honestly didn’t know how to get there.\n\nSo I plugged in my starting point and my final destination.\n\nIt says, take a bus to Puerto Vallarta airport (PVR.)\n\nThen it suggests flying to Queretaro airport. And, finally, it says to take a shuttle between Queretaro to San Miguel de Allende.\n\nThis map provided a magnificent starting point. Now, I knew how to get there. However, I didn’t follow these steps exactly.\n\nThis is What I did\n\nInstead of taking a bus to PVR, I decided to take an Uber. From here, I weighed my price options for flights. I could fly to Guadalajara then to Queretaro. Or I could make it to Queretaro via Mexico City.\n\nPrices were better through Mexico City, but also, there were more flight options with Aeromexico. This means if my flight gets canceled or something happens, I have a backup.\n\nI chose Mexico City, then Queretaro airport.\n\nNow comes the tricky part and the part that confused me the most.\n\nHow do you get from Queretaro to San Miguel de Allende? Rome to Rio suggested a shuttle service called BajioGo.\n\nI clicked on the website, looked around, saw the prices, and ultimately decided this was a great option.\n\nTheir website looked clean. I didn’t get any bad vibes from it. I looked at rideshare options versus private transport options. It had everything.\n\nSo, I booked it, and the rest is history.\n\nEven though this trip to San Miguel de Allende basically took all day to get to and all day to get back, I knew I was set.\n\nI had my plane tickets, and round trip shuttle passes in hand. I was ready.\n\nLet me break it down for you:\n\nIf you’re ever in a bind and need suggestions on how to get places, Rome to Rio will help immensely. A resource like this can only help, and I wanted to share it with you."
