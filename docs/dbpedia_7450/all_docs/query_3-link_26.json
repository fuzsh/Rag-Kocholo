        "text": "Traveling around the world has brought so much joy to my life. Travel has taught me to be adaptable, curious and it has enriched my life giving me memories that will last a lifetime. Yet at some point or another, we have all had to sit down and book that trip. And even though we are anticipating the fun times ahead, booking flights, accommodation and transfers can leave us feeling stressed and confused.\n\nRecently, through my UX design intensive course at General Assembly I had the opportunity to combine my love of travel and UX design working on a project with Rome2rio to help make travel planning easier.\n\nOur brief was to provide Rome2rio with recommendations and suggestions to improve the UX experience, specifically, to assist their users in getting to any location in the world.\n\nSuggested deliverables\n\nTakeaways from user research and competitor analysis\n\nSuggested features & design recommendations\n\nUse cases & user stories\n\nPrototypes (paper and interactive)\n\nPresentation (30mins)\n\nClick here to view interactive prototype\n\nMethodology\n\nTo assist with our workflow, and to ensure our research remained at the core of what we would achieve, we employed the Double Diamond design process to identify priorities and timeframes.\n\nWorking in a team of 3 x UX designers we applied an agile project methodology to our 2.5 week sprint.\n\nEarly on into the project we identified specific roles for each designer based on individual strengths. I took on the role of product manager along with the designing and development of the clickable prototype. As a product manager is was important for me to ensure that we communicated daily with our client so they were aware of the status of the project and they were able to provide ongoing feedback.\n\nStand-ups — proved valuable allowing all team members to update each other on the progress of their tasks, their goals, and potential challenges ahead. These meetings allowed the project team to collaborate effectively and keep track of timeframes and deadlines.\n\nWeekly retros — allowed the project team to reflect on what had been achieved and identify goals for the week ahead. This helped us maintain focus and keep our shared goal front of mind.\n\nTrello — was used as a primary tool used to track the project status. This helped each team member be accountable and ensured all members were aware of the backlog of jobs that needed to be completed. It also allowed us to collaborate and share creative ideas.\n\nAbout Rome2rio\n\nRome2rio looks to make travel planning easy. With door-to-door travel information and booking engine, helping you get to and from any location in the world.\n\nEnter any address, landmark, or city as your destination and they instantly display all your travel and booking options, along with information about accommodation and things to do, in one convenient spot.\n\nWhether you’re after flight, train, bus, ferry, rideshare or rental car info, they’ve got estimated prices, journey durations and booking details.\n\n| Discovery\n\nCompetitor Analysis\n\nWe undertook a detailed competitor analysis of similar websites and applications that assist travellers in their traveling needs​.\n\nWe found that while each company focused on solving a particular pain point, none solved the problem of collating multiple trips and plans together to help a user view their entire multi-stop trip in one location.\n\nKey findings\n\nBooking.com\n\nThe “tracking your hotel bookings” feature on their website gives the user confidence that all nights are booked and helps the user identify actions are missing.\n\nTripadvisor\n\nWith its focus on reviews and rating the function of the website helps the user build confidence in their choice through recommendations of trusted advisors.\n\nWhile it does allow for multi-trip flight bookings only, it is a time consuming process lacking an auto generated system.\n\nGoEuro\n\nDoes not allow for multi trip travel plans.\n\nWhen booking, it highlights both cost and travel time, allowing travellers to make informed decisions.\n\nGoogle"
