        "text": "As all the others have (emphatically) said, Deutsche Bahn (DB) is the best site for booking tickets in Germany. The other sites you mentioned will charge a premium and are not nearly as efficient as DB. I used DB exclusively to buy all my train tickets in 2022 for a month long trip to Germany, and had no problems at all. I know there are no trains now because of the strike, but you can still book online and check prices. https://int.bahn.de/en\n\nOne thing I would make sure and do is to download the DB Navigator app. Both Apple and Google Play have it. This will hold your account information and your tickets, so that you can easily show the QR code to the conductor. The other advantage to having the app is that you will receive push notifications of train delays, cancellations and track changes. Without the app, you have to rely on the electronic boards (and that will only be at the large stations) or broadcasted announcements (which may or may not be in English).\n\nIf you would like to share where you are going to and when, we can give you some help with tickets and other passes that might be relevant to you. For example, there are regional passes available, super saver passes, and also the Deutschland monthly Â£49 subscription (which can be cancelled after a month). But it really depends on your destinations and how much you will be using the trins.\n\nAgree, it's best to buy your ticket from the primary source. For Germany that's usually the DB.\n\nHowever, Rome2Rio, as well as it's parent company Omio, can be very useful. They show other travel options, such as by bus or car sharing, that may be faster, more convenient or cheaper. Sometimes rail service isn't available and the above companies identify what is available.\n\nIn Germany, for example, the trip from Frankfurt to the Frankfurt-Hahn airport is usually faster, cheaper and more convenient by taking one of the bus options.\n\nWhile it's good to know about buses when they are a better (or the only) option, the fact is that much of the information on fares, travel times and frequencies displayed by Rome2Rio is out-and-out wrong. I don't use it for anything other than finding the name of the bus company on a route I'm interested in, and even then, it is often just as easy to get the information from Google. If you see something on Rome2Rio that looks like a good option for you, you need to go immediately to the operating company's website to verify it.\n\nMy reading of online reviews strongly suggests that Rail Ninja is a crooked company. Do not use it under any circumstances.\n\nI would never use any source for tickets other than the Bahn website.\n\nI usually only use the DB website for planning purposes. I mostly use regional passes and LÃ¤nder tickets, and those I purchase at the station at the time of travel, or I use local tickets, purchased at the time of travel. The only time I purchase tickets online is for long distance trains, when advance purchase can give me a much better price.\n\nI've looked at the Trainline website, but I can't find a reason to use them. They might be a little easier to use than the Bahn website, but their tickets are always more expensive than purchasing from the Bahn and then they add a service fee. You best prices are from the Bahn."
