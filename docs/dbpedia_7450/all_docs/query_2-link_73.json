        "text": "Germany. The country is synonymous with beer, sausages, incredible hiking, majestic castles, serious people, and wild techno parties. It’s huge, diverse, and utterly amazing.\n\nThere’s a vibrant art and music scene in Berlin, beautiful forests in the west, majestic cathedrals and castles throughout the country, picturesque “Sound of Music” cities in the south, and overlooked historic cities and beaches in the north.\n\nThe more I visit Germany, the more I fall in love with it. Whether you are backpacking, traveling on a mid-range budget, or looking to splash out, traveling around Germany is wonderful.\n\nThat said, Germany is a huge country so don’t rush your visit. There’s more to the country than just Berin and those cross-country train rides are longer than you think.\n\nThis travel guide to Germany will help you plan your trip, save money, and make the most of your visit!"
