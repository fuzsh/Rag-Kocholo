        "text": "If you're sick of air travel and the many major flight interruptions in recent years, you might be reluctant to fly again, especially for shorter distances. Gas prices, tolls, and the frustration of driving make long-distance car travel just as unappealing. If you have to get somewhere during the busy holiday travel season, going by bus or train might be your best option. The travel apps listed below help you compare cost, route, total travel time, and other factors when searching for tickets on a bus or train.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles to traveling by bus and train, however, is knowing which apps search across bus and train companies to help you compare your options. These are the ones you need for traveling in the US and Canada in particular, listed in the order of how strongly I recommend them.\n\nCompares Bus, Train, Air, and Car Travel: Rome2Rio\n\nRome2Rio is best when you need to compare not only the prices but also the total time for getting from point A to B via different modes of travel. Enter your starting point and destination, and Rome2Rio lists the estimated travel time and cost for going by air, bus, train, car, or sometimes a combination. A good example is the route between Buffalo, NY, and Washington, DC. Going entirely by train can take 12 hours or more, and the bus route is more than 16 hours. But by combining train travel and one flight, you can get there in four hours or less for a reasonable starting price of about $134. Rome2Rio isn't restricted to the US and Canada and works particularly well in Europe; a representative told me it works worldwide. When I tested the app for a route in Canada, the app pushed me to a web page for my ticket purchase.\n\nI've been contributing to PCMag since 2011 and am currently the deputy managing editor for the software team. My column, Get Organized, has been running on PCMag since 2012. It gives advice on how to manage all the devices, apps, digital photos, email, and other technology that can make you feel like you're going to have a panic attack.\n\nMy latest book is The Everything Guide to Remote Work, which goes into great detail about a subject that I've been covering as a writer and participating in personally since well before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI specialize in apps for productivity and collaboration, â€¦"
