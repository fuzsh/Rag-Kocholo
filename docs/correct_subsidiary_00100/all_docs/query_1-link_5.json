        "text": "On April 15, 2015, Alcatel Lucent (the parent company of Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., the Benefit Plansâ sponsoring employer) and Nokia Corporation (a Finnish corporation headquartered in Helsinki, Finland) announced their intention to combine through a public exchange offer whereby Nokia would acquire all of Alcatel Lucent, with Alcatel Lucent shareholders receiving shares of Nokia. The exchange offer formally opened on November 18, 2015 and closed on December 23, 2015.\n\nAs a result of the exchange offer, on January 7, 2016, Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc. (âALUSAâ) became a wholly owned (indirect) subsidiary of Nokia. Notwithstanding the change in the identity of ALUSAâs parent, ALUSA continues to be the sponsoring employer and administrator of the Plans.\n\nNow that weâre Nokia, recently published benefits information and other communications on BenefitAnswers Plus will reflect the Nokia brand. Older benefits information will continue to be displayed as originally presented (with the Alcatel-Lucent brand) and will be retired as appropriate. Rest assured, the type of information on BenefitAnswers Plus is not changing, and the website will continue to be your go-to benefits resource.\n\nAt the same time, BenefitAnswers Plus has been given a refresh, and its look and feel will continue to evolve over the next several months as itâs integrated into the Nokia family of websites."
