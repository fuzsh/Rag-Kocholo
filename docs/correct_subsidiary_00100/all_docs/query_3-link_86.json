BUSINESS.\n\nGENERAL\n\nLucent Technologies Inc. (\"Lucent\" or the \"Company\") was incorporated in\n\nDelaware in November 1995. The Company has its principal executive offices at\n\n600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 (telephone number\n\n908-582-8500). Prior to February 1, 1996, AT&T Corp. (\"AT&T\") conducted the\n\nCompany's business through various divisions and subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company was formed following the announcement in September 1995 by AT&T\n\nof its intention to create a separate company comprised of the AT&T systems and\n\ntechnology businesses and operations. On February 1, 1996, AT&T began\n\nexecuting its decision to separate the Company into a stand-alone company (the\n\n\"Separation\") by transferring assets and liabilities to the Company. On April\n\n10, 1996 the Company issued 112,037,037 shares of its Common Stock in an\n\nInitial Public Offering (\"IPO\"), and on September 30, 1996, AT&T distributed\n\nall of its shares in the Company to AT&T shareholders of record as of September\n\n17, 1996. As used herein, references to the \"Company\" or \"Lucent\" include the\n\nhistorical operating results and activities of the business and operations\n\nwhich comprise the Company as of the date hereof.\n\nOn July 17, 1996, the Company's Board of Directors voted to change the\n\nCompany's fiscal year from a calendar year to a year beginning October 1st and\n\nending September 30th. Accordingly, unless the context otherwise requires,\n\nreferences herein to the \"year 1996,\" \"fiscal 1996,\" \"this year,\" \"1996,\" or\n\nsimilar terms mean the nine-month period January 1, 1996 through September 30,\n\n1996.\n\nThe Company is one of the world's leading designers, developers and\n\nmanufacturers of telecommunications systems, software and products. The\n\nCompany is a global market leader in the sale of public telecommunications\n\nsystems, and is a supplier of systems or software to most of the world's\n\nlargest network operators. The Company is also a global market leader in the\n\nsale of business communications systems and in the sale of microelectronic\n\ncomponents for communications applications to manufacturers of communications\n\nsystems and computers. Further, the Company is the largest supplier in the\n\nUnited States of telecommunications products for consumers. In addition, the\n\nCompany has provided engineering, installation, maintenance or operations\n\nsupport services to over 250 network operators in 75 countries. The Company's\n\nresearch and development activities are conducted through Bell Laboratories\n\n(\"Bell Labs\"), which consists of approximately three-quarters of the total\n\nresources of AT&T's former Bell Laboratories division, one of the world's\n\nforemost industrial research and development organizations.\n\nSYSTEMS FOR NETWORK OPERATORS\n\nThe Company designs, develops, manufactures and services systems and\n\nsoftware which enable network operators to provide wireline and wireless local,\n\nlong distance and international voice, data and video services and cable\n\ntelevision service. The Company's networks, which include switching,\n\ntransmission and cable systems, are packaged and customized with application\n\nsoftware, operations support systems and associated professional services.\n\nSystems and Services\n\nTelecommunications Networking Systems. The Company designs, develops,\n\nmanufactures and services advanced telecommunications networking systems, which\n\ninclude equipment, software and associated professional services. These\n\nsystems connect, route, manage and store voice, data and video in any\n\ncombination, and are used for: wireline access; local and long distance\n\nswitching; intelligent network services and signaling; wireless communications,\n\nincluding both cellular and personal communications services (\"PCS\"); and\n\nhigh-speed, broadband multifunctional communications.\n\nThe Company supplies each of the five broad elements that comprise\n\ntelecommunications networks: switching systems, which route information through\n\nthe network; transmission systems, which provide the communications path\n\nthrough the network that carries information between points in the network;\n\noperation support\n\n1\n\n5\n\nsystems, which enable service providers to manage the work flow, planning,\n\nsurveillance, management, provisioning and continuous testing of their\n\nnetworks; intelligent network/application software, which enables service\n\nproviders to offer a broad array of enhanced and differentiated services; and\n\ncable systems, which provide the transport media between points in a network.\n\nThese systems collectively comprise the infrastructure that enables\n\ntelecommunications network operators to provide traditional narrowband voice\n\nand data services and that enables both new and traditional network operators\n\nto offer broadband multifunctional services.\n\nThe Company has a wireline local access installed base (the number of access\n\nlines serviced by switches manufactured by the Company) of approximately 110\n\nmillion lines. The Company's primary switching products are the 5ESS(R)\n\nswitch for local and long distance switching and international gateways, and the\n\n4ESS(TM) Digital Switch (the \"4ESS switch\") for long distance and international\n\nswitching.\n\nThe 5ESS switch is used throughout the world to provide a combination of\n\nnetwork applications, including local and long distance switching and\n\ninternational gateways, operator services, network signaling, intelligent\n\nnetworking and wireless switching. As of September 1995, the 5ESS switch, with\n\nthe Company's 5E10 software, has enabled network operators to offer\n\nsimultaneous wireline and wireless, local, long distance and international\n\nservices as well as any combination of voice, data and video.\n\nThe 4ESS switch, which was developed for and is primarily deployed in AT&T's\n\nnetwork, is used to provide domestic and international long distance switching.\n\nThe 4ESS switch can handle over 775,000 peak hour calls.\n\nThe Company designs, develops, manufactures and services a broad range of\n\ntransmission access and transport systems. Network operators use these systems\n\nto transport any combination of voice, data and video between subscribers and\n\nthe central office or between points within a network engaged in local,\n\nnational or international communications.\n\nWorld standards for transmission systems have undergone rapid technological\n\nchange in recent years. The new standards, known as Synchronous Optical\n\nNetwork (\"SONET\") in North America and SDH in other markets, maximize\n\ntransmission capability and simplify network management for network operators.\n\nThe Company markets systems supporting both standards.\n\nThe Company offers a broad line of transmission access systems for the\n\nprovision of a wide range of services, including traditional telecommunications\n\nservice and broadband multifunctional services. Transmission access systems\n\ntransport information between the subscriber and the central office. The\n\nCompany's products include SLC(R)-2000, a hybrid fiber/copper pair system,\n\nwhich extends fiber-based optical transmission into the local loop. The\n\nCompany's products also include the SDV-2000, a switched digital video system\n\nwhich extends fiber to the curb, and ASOS, which enables network operators to\n\nmanage the work flow, planning, surveillance, provisioning and continuous\n\ntesting of their multifunctional networks.\n\nThe Company's transmission transport systems are utilized for high capacity\n\ncommunications between points within a communications network. These products\n\nare primarily digital and provide for the movement of any combination of voice,\n\ndata, and video across fiber, coaxial and microwave based media. The Company's\n\nproducts include fiber transport systems (FT 2000), digital multiplexer systems\n\n(DDM 2000) and the digital access and cross connect systems (DACS family of\n\nproducts).\n\nThe Company's operation support systems enhance a network operator's ability\n\nto activate, manage and maintain its networks. These systems continuously\n\nmonitor network performance and activity level, and allow for rapid trouble\n\nidentification, load balancing and planning for network utilization. The\n\nCompany's systems support the efforts of network operators to reduce operating\n\ncosts and minimize labor by automating labor intensive tasks.\n\nThe Company's network management systems offer a broad array of modular\n\nsoftware, including element managers designed for traditional telephony, video\n\nand wireless; network managers that monitor, test and optimize the utilization\n\nof a network; service managers that manage work flow; and business managers\n\nthat include customer service systems. For example, the Company's NetMinder\n\nsystem is an advanced network management\n\n2\n\n6\n\nrouting system that mitigates network congestion through efficient call routing\n\nand completion.\n\nThe Company's A-I-NET(R) intelligent network products enable network\n\noperators to offer new services that can be created, deployed or managed by\n\nthemselves, the Company, or third parties. Services created with A-I-NET\n\nproducts include toll free calling (800 and 888 service in the United States),\n\ncall forwarding, call waiting, voice dialing and messaging.\n\nThe Company has introduced products to address the growing demand for\n\nemerging broadband multifunctional services which permit the simultaneous\n\ntransmission of any combination of voice, data and video, such as its high\n\ncapacity Asynchronous Transfer Mode (\"ATM\") switching product, the\n\nGLOBEVIEW(R)-2000 Broadband System.\n\nIn addition, the Company designs, develops, manufactures and services cable\n\nsystems, which include optical fiber, fiber optic cable, electronic wire and\n\ncable and apparatus for both fiber and copper cable systems. The Company's\n\ncable systems are used to connect various devices in a network and terminal\n\ndevices to public and private networks. These cable systems are deployed for\n\noutside plant and central office wiring, and for traditional telephony, cable\n\ntelevision, wireless networks and broadband applications.\n\nThe Company also supplies fiber optic cable systems, high strength, high\n\nperformance fiber for underseas cablers and outside plant turnkey systems,\n\nwhich are generally large capital projects in emerging markets for the\n\nengineering and construction of telecommunications infrastructure. The\n\nCompany's TRUEWAVE(TM) optical fiber enables network operators to reduce their\n\ncosts by increasing the distance between optical amplifiers.\n\nWireless Network Systems. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and\n\nservices wireless network infrastructure systems, which include the 5ESS\n\nswitch, base stations, wireless network software and operation support systems.\n\nThese systems provide network operators with the capability to offer a wide\n\nrange of cellular and other wireless communications services, including PCS,\n\nwireless data and fixed wireless access.\n\nThe Company's wireless systems are in operation in nine of the top ten\n\nUnited States Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The Company's primary wireless\n\nsystem is the AUTOPLEX(R) System 1000 product family, which includes the high\n\ncapacity Series II base station. The base station contains the radio\n\ntransceiver that establishes wireless communications with a mobile telephone.\n\nBase stations are arranged geographically so that mobile customers can be\n\n\"handed off\" seamlessly from one base station to the next as they travel. The\n\nnetwork intelligence to accomplish this is housed in the Company's Mobile\n\nSwitching Center, which includes the 5ESS switch and which connects the base\n\nstations to the public telephone network. The Company also offers base\n\nstations for start-up applications and smaller markets, a minicell product for\n\nrural and international markets and a microcell for congested, high traffic\n\nareas.\n\nWireless technology is evolving from analog to digital. The Company\n\nprovides networks based on a variety of the leading air interface standards:\n\nAMPS, CDMA, TDMA and GSM.\n\nIn addition, the Company designs, develops, manufactures and services fixed\n\nwireless access systems. The Company offers Wireless Subscriber Systems, which\n\nsupport the AMPS standard, and the new AIRLOOP(TM) Wireless Local Loop system,\n\nwhich utilizes CDMA technology. Also, as part of the acquisition of the\n\nmanufacturing and other operations of certain subsidiaries of Philips\n\nElectronics NV (the \"Philips Businesses\"), the Company acquired Philips' fixed\n\nwireless system, which is based on the DECT (digital enhanced cordless\n\ntelephone) standard. All three systems enable network operators to expand\n\ntheir networks in markets where traditional wireline systems are not cost\n\njustified, and to provide telephone services as an alternative to traditional\n\nnetwork operators.\n\nThe Company designs, develops, manufactures, and services CDPD-based\n\nwireless data systems which enable wireless network operators to offer data\n\nservices as an overlay to their existing analog voice infrastructure without\n\nacquiring additional spectrum or upgrading to a digital network. These systems\n\noffer the increased reliability and efficiency of switched digital packet data\n\nsystems.\n\n3\n\n7\n\nDue to the complexity of wireless systems, the Company also offers a broad\n\nrange of professional services, which include project management, site\n\nacquisition, radio frequency engineering, microwave relocation, construction\n\nmanagement, cellular optimization and wireless data support.\n\nMarkets\n\nThe principal customers for the Company's systems are network operators that\n\nprovide wireline and wireless local, long distance and international\n\ntelecommunications services, including local, long distance and international\n\ntelecommunications companies and cable television companies. The Company's\n\nsystems for network operators are installed to expand the capacity and features\n\noffered by existing networks, to replace older technology in existing networks\n\nand to establish new networks for entrants into deregulated or previously\n\nunserved markets. See \"Outlook -- Reliance on Major Customers.\"\n\nAs a result of structural, public policy and technological changes, since\n\nthe mid-1980's the telecommunications industry has undergone a period of\n\nsignificant growth in the number of lines in service and applications offered.\n\nIn developed markets, deregulation has permitted new market entrants to\n\nconstruct networks in previously monopolistic markets. In response, existing\n\nnetwork operators have expanded beyond traditional franchises and are offering\n\nnew services. In emerging markets, privatization, competition and economic\n\nexpansion have increased demand for networking systems. At the same time,\n\ntechnological advances also have increased demand by reducing operating costs\n\nand facilitating new applications, including multifunctional services.\n\nThe Company markets and sells its products worldwide primarily through a\n\ndirect sales force due to the complexity of these systems. Most of the\n\nCompany's sales of systems for network operators are made pursuant to general\n\npurchase agreements, which establish the terms and conditions and provide for\n\nprice determination to be made on a contract bid basis. In addition, certain\n\nof the large infrastructure projects are conducted under long-term, fixed-price\n\ncontracts. See \"Outlook -- Multi-Year Contracts\" and \"-- Seasonality.\"\n\nAs a result of the increased complexity of systems for network operators and\n\nthe high cost of developing and maintaining in-house expertise, network\n\noperators demand complete, integrated and turn-key projects. Network operators\n\nincreasingly are seeking overall network or systems solutions that require an\n\nincreased software content which would enable them to deploy rapidly new and\n\ndifferentiable services. In response, the Company has formed an organization\n\nfocused on turn-key network engineering projects for both public and private\n\nsector customers. The Company markets integrated solutions whereby the Company\n\nassumes full responsibility for the project, and engineers, designs and\n\ninstalls the network, including equipment and software manufactured by both the\n\nCompany and third parties.\n\nIncreasingly, as a result of the financial demands of major network\n\ndeployments, network operators are looking to their suppliers to arrange for\n\nfinancing. The ability to provide financing is a requirement to conduct\n\nbusiness in certain emerging U.S. and foreign markets, and in some cases the\n\nCompany furnishes or guarantees financing for customers. As a result, the\n\nCompany works with its customers to structure and place financing packages.\n\nSee \"Outlook -- Future Capital Requirements.\"\n\nIn order to market its product line worldwide, the Company has established\n\nwholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures with local companies in 16\n\ncountries.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company believes that its key competitive factors are its broad product\n\nline, large installed base, relationship with key customers, technological\n\nexpertise and new product development capabilities. The Company's primary\n\ncompetitors in the market for telecommunications systems are four very large\n\nEuropean and North American companies which have substantial technological and\n\nfinancial resources and which offer similar broad product catalogs. These\n\ncompetitors are Alcatel Alsthom, Northern Telecom Limited, Siemens AG and\n\nTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson. In 1995, the Company and these four\n\ncompetitors collectively accounted for about 34% of the world's public network\n\nsystems sales, of which the Company's sales of systems for network operators\n\naccounted for 9%.\n\n4\n\n8\n\nIn addition, in all of the Company's product areas other than switching, the\n\nCompany faces significant competition from other companies which do business in\n\none or a number of such product areas. For example, in wireless systems,\n\nMotorola, Inc. and Nokia Corporation, both of which are very large companies\n\nwith substantial technological and financial resources, are significant\n\ncompetitors. In transmission and cable systems, competition in the markets\n\nincludes hundreds of smaller competitors.\n\nBUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS\n\nThe Company designs, develops, manufactures and services communications\n\nsystems and products for large and small business customers, home offices and\n\ngovernment agencies. The Company's business communications systems can be\n\nupgraded regularly with new software releases, can support local and wide area\n\nvoice and data networking and are often integral components of global\n\nenterprise networks. The Company's systems primarily are customer\n\npremises-based private switching systems and products, call center systems,\n\nvoice processing systems, which include voice messaging and voice response\n\nsystems, and the associated application software and professional support\n\nservices. In addition, the Company has begun to participate in the emerging\n\nmulti-media products business. The Company serves over 1.4 million business\n\nlocations in the United States and approximately 100,000 business locations in\n\nover 90 other countries.\n\nSystems and Services\n\nThe Company's core business communications system products are private\n\nswitching systems, generally PBXs and key systems, usually located at the\n\ncustomer's premises, that permit a number of local telephones or terminals to\n\ncommunicate with one another, with or without use of the public telephone\n\nnetwork. The Company offers wired and wireless communications systems,\n\nincluding the DEFINITY(R) family of products for large customers and the MERLIN\n\nLEGEND(R) and PARTNER(R) systems for smaller businesses and home offices. The\n\nDEFINITY Enterprise Communication Server provides real-time voice and\n\nmixed-media call processing. The recently announced FREEWORKS family of\n\nbusiness mobility solutions enables communication throughout the work place\n\nwith full freedom of movement.\n\nThe Company's messaging and response systems store and forward voice, data\n\nand images and conduct initial call processing, which integrates PBX and\n\ncomputer functions. In addition, the Company is a technological leader in the\n\ndevelopment of speech recognition algorithms, which have been incorporated into\n\nboth public and private call processing applications, such as operator\n\nservices. The Company's principal systems include the INTUITY(TM) AUDIX(R) and\n\nDEFINITY AUDIX voice messaging systems for use with the Company's or a\n\ncompetitor's PBX; INTUITY CONVERSANT(R), a multi-lingual interactive voice\n\nresponse system which can recognize speech in nine languages/dialects; and the\n\nINTUITY Multimedia Messaging System, a system that combines voice messaging and\n\nvoice-response technology into a single desktop application.\n\nThe Company's call center systems integrate the hardware and software\n\nassociated with computing, telephony, and multifunctional messaging and\n\nresponse applications. Call centers are the initial entry point for customers\n\nto access a business' telephone sales and support operation. The Company's\n\nsystems permit the routing and administration of a large volume of incoming\n\ncalls, and the integration with business databases of customer and product\n\ninformation. The Company's call center systems are used by companies in\n\ndiverse industries such as financial services, retailing and transportation.\n\nThe call center environment in which these companies operate is characterized\n\nby hundreds of telephone service agents located in geographically dispersed\n\nnetworked sites, processing tens of thousands of calls per hour. For example,\n\nusing these systems, businesses can provide their customers with the ability to\n\ncheck balances or order status, to place orders, and to receive additional\n\ninformation and support.\n\nIn October 1995, the Company introduced the MMCX, the industry's first\n\nmultifunctional product to deliver real-time business calling features such as\n\nconferencing, transfer, call coverage, and add/drop to switched voice or data\n\nnetworking. The MMCX allows customers to migrate their existing network to\n\nmultifunction capabilities. This enables the customer to support new\n\napplications and transport technologies, such as ATM.\n\n5\n\n9\n\nIn addition, the Company's SYSTIMAX(R) structured wiring system for business\n\ncustomers provides broadband multifunctional LAN interconnections within a\n\nbuilding or campus. These systems are comprised of fiber optic and copper\n\ncable and associated apparatus.\n\nThe Company offers a wide range of professional service options, including\n\ncall center design, network engineering, training, remote diagnostics and\n\ndedicated on-site technicians. Their on-demand services involve routine\n\ntesting and diagnostics, maintenance and repair, moves and rearrangements, and\n\nsoftware and hardware upgrade installations.\n\nThe Company's remote diagnostics and repair capability permits the Company\n\nto monitor, test, maintain and resolve problems from its regional service\n\ncenters. Many of the Company's systems are designed with intelligent software\n\nwhich establishes a real-time link between the customer premises and a regional\n\nservice center's expert system. This permits the customer to reduce its system\n\ndown-time and enables the Company to automate many maintenance and repair\n\ntasks.\n\nMarkets\n\nThe Company markets its systems and services to large and small businesses\n\nand government agencies through a large, direct sales force and through a\n\nnetwork of agents, dealers and distributors. In the United States, the Company\n\neffects these sales primarily through the direct sales force, while sales\n\nelsewhere occur primarily through the efforts of dealers and distributors. The\n\nCompany's systems are deployed in applications for customer sales and service,\n\nconferencing and collaboration, mobility and distributed work force, messaging\n\nand enterprise networking. The Company fields a large group of application\n\nspecialists to design call center, distance learning and other customized\n\napplications.\n\nThe Company believes that the premises-based communications market may be\n\ntransforming from distinct voice and data networks to multifunctional networks\n\nthat will be able to support any combination of voice, video and data\n\ncommunications simultaneously. The Company is designing certain business\n\ncommunications systems to enable its customers to simplify their premises\n\nnetworks by combining separate voice, video and data networks into a single\n\narchitecture.\n\nThe Company has entered into alliances with Lotus Development Corporation,\n\nto enable multimedia messaging in the Lotus Notes environment, and with Novell,\n\nInc. to extend multimedia messaging and computer/telephony integration, and\n\nwas one of the founders with International Business Machines Corporation, Apple\n\nComputer, Inc., and Siemens AG of VERSIT*, an industry consortium organized to\n\nensure the interoperability of multivendor multimedia applications. In 1996\n\nthe Company acquired Agile Networks, a provider of intelligent data switching\n\nproducts.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company considers its working relationships with its customers and\n\nknowledge of their individual business needs to be important competitive\n\nfactors. The Company competes principally with three other large companies\n\nwith substantial technological and financial resources in the sale of business\n\ncommunication systems. These competitors are Northern Telecom Limited, Siemens\n\nAG (through its subsidiary Siemens Rolm Communications, Inc.) and Alcatel\n\nAlsthom. Together with the Company, in 1995 these competitors accounted for\n\napproximately 52% of the sales of business communications systems globally,\n\nwith the Company accounting for approximately 11%. In addition, as the market\n\ntransforms to multifunctional systems, the Company expects that it also may\n\nencounter competition from companies that design and manufacture data network\n\nequipment.\n\nThe Company believes that key competitive factors in this market are service\n\nsupport, the ability to upgrade existing systems for new applications, price\n\nand reliability.\n\n- -------------------\n\n* Lotus Notes is a registered trademark of Lotus Development Corporation;\n\nVERSIT is a trademark of the consortium's founders.\n\n6\n\n10\n\nMICROELECTRONICS PRODUCTS\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures and sells integrated circuits (\"ICs\"),\n\nelectronic power systems and optoelectronic components for communications\n\napplications. These microelectronic products are important components of many\n\nof the Company's own systems and products. The Company also supplies these\n\ncomponents to other manufacturers of communications systems and computers. The\n\nCompany offers products in several IC product areas critical to communications\n\napplications, including digital signal processors (\"DSPs\") for digital cellular\n\nphones and standard-cell application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\").\n\nProducts\n\nThe Company's ICs are designed to provide advanced communications and\n\ncontrol functions for a wide variety of electronic products and systems. The\n\nCompany focuses on IC products that are used in communications and computing\n\nand that require high-performance and low power chip architectures; complex\n\nlarge-scale chip design in digital, analog and mixed-signal technologies; DSP\n\narchitectures and algorithms; high-frequency and high-voltage technologies; and\n\nhigh speed data and signal processing. The Company offers a wide variety of\n\nstandard, semi-custom and custom products for cellular equipment,\n\ncommunications networks, computers and computer peripherals, modems and\n\nconsumer communications products. Products include DSPs, ASICs, field\n\nprogrammable gate arrays and communications ICs. The Company's products are\n\nmanufactured using a variety of technologies, from low-power, low-voltage\n\nsubmicron CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductors) to high-frequency and\n\nhigh-voltage bipolar processes.\n\nThe Company designs, develops and manufactures energy systems, electronic\n\npower supplies and associated magnetic components for the telecommunications\n\nand electronic data processing industries. These products serve applications\n\nranging from modems for personal computers to large telephone central offices.\n\nProducts include DC/DC converters, AC/DC switching power supplies,\n\ntransformers, inductors and energy systems that provide alarm, control, and\n\nbackup power management.\n\nThe Company designs, develops and manufactures optoelectronic products which\n\nconvert electricity to light (emitters) and light to electricity (detectors),\n\nthereby facilitating optical transmission of information. These products\n\ninclude semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, integrated transmitters and\n\nreceivers, and advanced-technology erbium-doped fiber amplifiers. The Company\n\nprovides these products worldwide to manufacturers serving the\n\ntelecommunications, cable television and network computing markets.\n\nOptoelectronic products extend the transmission capacity of fiber to meet the\n\nrequirements of such applications as video-on-demand, interactive video,\n\nteleconferencing, image transmission and remote database searching. The\n\nCompany markets a number of advanced products, including critical\n\noptoelectronic components that support telecommunication transmission;\n\nlong-wavelength optical data modules for data networking; and analog lasers for\n\nuse in cable television fiber optic transmission. The Company believes that\n\nits optoelectronic products have higher photonics reliability than those of its\n\ncompetitors due to their low field failure rate and the Company's evaluation\n\nmethodologies in manufacturing that allow the detection and elimination of\n\nearly failures.\n\nIn December 1996, the Company sold its operations for the design and\n\nmanufacture of printed circuit boards and backplanes.\n\nMarkets\n\nThe Company's microelectronic products are sold globally to manufacturers of\n\ncommunications systems and computers. In addition, the Company's energy power\n\nsystems are sold directly to U.S. and foreign telephone companies. The\n\nCompany's customers are competing in markets characterized by rapid\n\ntechnological changes, decreasing product life cycles, price competition and\n\nincreased user applications. These markets have experienced significant\n\nexpansion in the number and types of products they offer to end-users,\n\nparticularly in personal computing and portable access communication devices.\n\nAs a result, the Company's customers continue to demand components which are\n\nsmaller, require less power, are more complex, provide greater functionality,\n\nand are produced with shorter design cycles and less manufacturing lead time.\n\nIn 1995, the Company also introduced a GSM hardware platform based upon a\n\nhighly integrated multiple-chip design for digital cellular phones that\n\nperforms all the key\n\n7\n\n11\n\nhandset functions between the microphone and the antenna in both voice and data\n\nservices. The Company also sells the associated software product elements\n\nnecessary to support the GSM standard.\n\nIn fiscal 1996, more than half of the Company's microelectronic production\n\nwas sold to customers other than the Company. The Company's microelectronic\n\nproducts are also key components of its systems for network operators, business\n\ncommunications systems, and consumer products. The Company's microelectronics\n\nproducts compete with products of third-party manufacturers for inclusion in\n\nthe Company's systems and products.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company considers its technological leadership, product leadership, and\n\nrelationships with key customers to be important competitive factors. The\n\nmarket for microelectronic products is global and generally highly fragmented.\n\nThe Company's competitors differ widely among product categories. The\n\nCompany's competitors in certain IC product categories include Motorola, Inc.\n\nand Texas Instruments Incorporated; in electronic power systems include Astec\n\nIndustries, Inc. and Unitech plc (through its subsidiary, NEMEC-Lambda); and\n\nin optoelectronics include Fujitsu Limited and Northern Telecom Limited.\n\nThe Company believes that key competitive factors in the microelectronics\n\nmarketplace are the early involvement in customers' future application\n\nrequirements, the speed of product and technological innovation, price,\n\ncustomer service, and manufacturing capacity. Other important competitive\n\nfactors include quality, reliability and local manufacturing presence.\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCTS\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, services and leases communications\n\nproducts for consumer, small office and home office use.\n\nProducts\n\nThe Company has a broad selection of telephone products for the consumer\n\nmarket. Cordless telephones are a significant portion of the Company's\n\nconsumer product line. The Company offers Cordless telephones based on the\n\ntraditional 46/49 frequency, as well as the 900 MHz bandwidth. The latest\n\nintroduction is the 9510 Digital Spread Spectrum model with the clearest sound\n\nand longest range of any telephone in the Company's product line. The Company\n\nalso offers a broad line of analog, digital, stand-alone and integrated\n\ntelephone answering systems, which are offered in corded and cordless versions.\n\nThe Company participates in the full spectrum of corded telephones including\n\nbasic, designer and feature telephones. The Company's TRIMLINE(R) telephone\n\ncontinues to be the highest volume telephone in the industry.\n\nThe Company plans to offer a line of cellular and PCS phones which conform to\n\nboth of the North American Digital Standards (TDMA and CDMA). The Company's\n\nproduct development efforts are focused on the creation of a high quality,\n\nflexible and cost effective architecture for these products in order to meet\n\nthe rapidly evolving needs of customers.\n\nThe Company is implementing a common design for its consumer products,\n\nwhich includes a common look, feel, feature placement and feature use. As part\n\nof this process, the Company expects to reduce the number of different\n\ncomponents and casings used in its product line. The Company believes this\n\nuniformity will reduce costs, reinforce its brand identity, and increase\n\nmanufacturing flexibility. The Company expects that up to 70 percent of its\n\nproduct line in 1997 will be new or redesigned products. In addition, the\n\nCompany has undertaken a program to increase the percentage of the products\n\ndesigned and manufactured in its own facilities. Under the Brand License\n\nAgreement (as defined herein), the Company has the right to market certain\n\nconsumer products under the \"AT&T\" name alone, and in combination with the\n\nCompany's name, each for certain specified periods. See \"Separation Agreements\n\n- -- Brand License and Related Matters.\"\n\nMarkets\n\nThe Company distributes its products in the United States through\n\napproximately 900 retailers representing over 17,000 retail outlets, including\n\nsuch national retailers as\n\n8\n\n12\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears, Roebuck and Co., Circuit City Stores, Inc., Best\n\nBuy Co., Inc. and Service Merchandise Company. In 1996, as previously\n\nannounced, the Company closed all of its Phone Center stores as part of its\n\nreorganization efforts. The Company also offers consumers a rental option for\n\nselected products, and currently serves over three and one-half million rental\n\ncustomers. Recently, the Company's practices have been challenged in\n\nconnection with rental of products.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company believes that its position in the consumer communications\n\nproducts industry is due to the quality and reliability of its products, the\n\n\"AT&T\" brand name, its strong distribution channels and its broad product line.\n\nThe Company's competitors in consumer products are traditional consumer\n\nelectronic manufacturers. The industry is characterized by significant\n\nconsolidation within each product category, although the principal competitors\n\nin each are different. In traditional telephone products, the Company's\n\nprincipal competitors are Thomson Consumer Electronics (marketing under the GE\n\nbrand), U.S. Electronics, Inc. (marketing under the BellSouth brand), Panasonic\n\nCo., USA and Sony Corporation which, together with the Company, accounted for\n\nabout 68% of market sales in 1995, of which the Company accounted for 31%. In\n\nwireless terminal products, the Company's principal competitors are Motorola\n\nand Nokia which, together with the Company, accounted for over 65% of market\n\nsales in 1995, of which the Company accounted for 7%.\n\nOTHER SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS\n\nThe Company designs, develops and manufactures advanced technology systems\n\nwhich support the United States federal government's need for specially\n\ndesigned integrated systems for military and civilian use. The Company offers\n\na full range of products on a direct funding basis from the United States\n\ngovernment. These systems focus on undersea sensor systems, information\n\nprocessing and secure communications. The funded research has generated\n\ncommercial by-products in lightwave transmission equipment, wireless\n\ncommunications systems and multifunctional compression algorithms.\n\nThe Company in 1996 sold its subsidiary, Paradyne, which designed and\n\nmanufactured modems and other data communications equipment.\n\nBELL LABORATORIES\n\nThe Company has been and will continue to be supported by the technological\n\nexpertise provided by Bell Labs, one of the world's foremost industrial\n\nresearch and development organizations. Bell Labs consists of all of the\n\noperations of AT&T's former Bell Laboratories division which support the\n\nbusinesses of the Company, and basic research capability, which together\n\ncomprise approximately three quarters of the total resources of AT&T's former\n\nBell Laboratories division. Bell Labs has made significant discoveries and\n\nadvances in communications science and technology, software design and\n\nengineering, and networking. These contributions include the invention of the\n\ntransistor and the design and development of ICs and many types of lasers.\n\nAreas of Bell Labs research and development work in recent years include:\n\nnetworking software; lightwave transmission, which offers greater transmission\n\ncapacity than other transmission systems; electronic switching technology,\n\nwhich enables rapid call processing, increased reliability and reduced network\n\ncosts; and microelectronics components, which bring the latest advantages of\n\nvery large scale integration to the full range of products offered by the\n\nCompany.\n\nBell Labs' research and development activities continue to focus on the core\n\ntechnologies critical to the Company's success, which are software, network\n\ndesign and engineering, microelectronics and photonics.\n\nBell Labs is a leader in software research, development and engineering for\n\ncommunications applications. For example, its innovations in fault-tolerant\n\nsoftware have enabled the Company to achieve a level of system reliability with\n\noff-the-shelf commercial processors that allows the Company to reduce its\n\nreliance on custom microprocessors.\n\nBell Labs has contributed many innovations in voice quality, is a leader in\n\nthe development of digital signal processing, and has developed a number of\n\ninnovative algorithms for high-quality speech and audio. These innovations\n\nhave contributed to the Company's implementation of speech processing\n\napplications which include text-to-\n\n9\n\n13\n\nspeech synthesis, speech recognition and automatic translation of speech from\n\none language to another.\n\nBell Labs also has led in the development of software-based networking\n\ntechnologies that support the Company's systems and products. Recently, it has\n\ndeveloped systems for digital cellular, PCS, mobile computing and wireless\n\nLANs, and its research in ATM led to the Company's offering of the first large\n\nATM switch in 1993.\n\nSimilarly, Bell Labs' advances extend to the microlasers used in today's\n\nbroadband multifunctional transmission systems, and to today's optical\n\namplifiers and TRUEWAVE(R) fiber. Current photonic research includes work on\n\npassive optical networks, photonic switching and quantum wire lasers.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nThe Company's backlog, calculated as the aggregate of the sales price\n\nof orders received from customers less revenue recognized, was approximately\n\n$12,100 million and $7,500 million on September 30, 1996 and December 31, 1995,\n\nrespectively (approximately 3% and 4% of which, respectively, represented\n\nbacklog of orders from AT&T). Approximately $6,200 million of orders included\n\nin the September 30, 1996 backlog are scheduled for delivery after September\n\n30, 1997. However, all orders are subject to possible rescheduling by\n\ncustomers. Although the Company believes that the orders included in the\n\nbacklog are firm, some orders may be canceled by the customer without penalty,\n\nand the Company may elect to permit cancellation of orders without penalty\n\nwhere management believes that it is in the Company's best interest to do so.\n\nAbout $6,700 million of the amount at September 30, 1996 is under large,\n\nmulti-year contracts of which about $5,000 million is scheduled for delivery\n\nafter September 30, 1997 and is included in the $6,200 million referred to\n\nabove. Approximately $4,000 million at September 30, 1996 and $3,400 million\n\nat December 31, 1995 are under large, long-term contracts with the Ministry of\n\nPost and Telecommunications of Saudi Arabia which require annual appropriations\n\nof the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nSOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS\n\nThe Company makes significant purchases of electronic components, copper,\n\nsilicon, precious metals, aluminum, and other materials and components from\n\nmany domestic and foreign sources. The Company has been able to obtain\n\nsufficient materials and components from sources around the world to meet its\n\nneeds. The Company also develops and maintains alternative sources for\n\nessential materials and components. Occasionally, special inventories of\n\ncomponents are maintained to minimize the effects of shortages. The Company\n\ndoes not have a concentration of sources of supply of materials, labor or\n\nservices that, if suddenly eliminated, could severely impact its operations.\n\nPATENTS AND TRADEMARKS\n\nFrom January 1, 1996 to September 30, 1996, the Company was issued 552\n\npatents in the United States and 1,497 in foreign countries. The Company owns\n\napproximately 8,200 patents in the United States and 14,000 in foreign\n\ncountries. These foreign patents are counterparts of the Company's United\n\nStates patents. Many of the patents owned by the Company are licensed to\n\nothers and the Company is licensed to use certain patents owned by others. In\n\nconnection with the Separation, the Company has entered into an extensive\n\ncross-licensing agreement with AT&T and NCR Corporation (\"NCR\"). See\n\n\"Separation Agreements -- Patent Licenses and Related Matters.\"\n\nThe Company intends to market its products under its own name and mark,\n\nexcept with respect to certain consumer products and business communications\n\nsystems, which may be marketed under the \"AT&T\" name alone until April 10, 1997\n\nor in combination with the Company's name until April 10, 2000. In addition,\n\ncertain leased products or maintenance contracts may be marketed under the\n\n\"AT&T\" name until October 10, 2001. See \"Separation Agreements -- Brand\n\nLicense and Related Matters.\"\n\nThe Company considers its many trademarks to be valuable assets. Most of\n\nits trademarks are registered throughout the world.\n\n10\n\n14\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis Outlook section and other sections of this Form 10-K report contain\n\nforward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates\n\nand projections about the industries in which the Company operates,\n\nmanagement's beliefs and assumptions made by management. Words such as\n\n\"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\"\n\nvariations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such\n\nforward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future\n\nperformance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (\"Future\n\nFactors\") which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and\n\nresults may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such\n\nforward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update\n\npublicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new\n\ninformation, future events or otherwise.\n\nFuture Factors include increasing price and product/services competition by\n\nforeign and domestic competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological\n\ndevelopments and changes; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new\n\nproducts and services on a timely, cost effective basis; the mix of\n\nproducts/services; the achievement of lower costs and expenses; domestic and\n\nforeign governmental and public policy changes which may affect the level of\n\nnew investments and purchases made by customers; changes in environmental and\n\nother domestic and foreign governmental regulations; protection and validity of\n\npatent and other intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers;\n\ntechnological, implementation and cost/financial risks in increasing use of\n\nlarge, multi-year contracts; the cyclical nature of the Company's business; the\n\noutcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings and\n\ncontinued availability of financing, financial instruments and financial\n\nresources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support the\n\nCompany's future business. These are representative of the Future Factors that\n\ncould affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition, such\n\nstatements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and\n\ngrowth rates, general domestic and international economic conditions including\n\ninterest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other Future Factors.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe Company currently faces significant competition in its markets and\n\nexpects that the level of price and product competition will increase. In\n\naddition, as a result of both the trend toward global expansion by foreign and\n\ndomestic competitors and technological and public policy changes, the Company\n\nanticipates that new and different competitors will enter its markets. These\n\ncompetitors may include entrants from the telecommunications, software and data\n\nnetworking industries. Existing competitors have, and new competitors may\n\nhave, strong financial capability, technological expertise and well-recognized\n\nbrand names.\n\nDependence On New Product Development\n\nThe markets for the Company's principal products are characterized by\n\nrapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product\n\nintroductions and evolving methods of building and operating telecommunications\n\nsystems for network operators and business customers. The Company's operating\n\nresults will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to\n\nintroduce new systems, software and services successfully on a timely basis and\n\nto reduce costs of existing systems, software and services. The success of\n\nthese and other new offerings is dependent on several factors, including proper\n\nidentification of customer needs, cost, timely completion and introduction,\n\ndifferentiation from offerings of the Company's competitors and market\n\nacceptance. In addition, new technological innovations generally require a\n\nsubstantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial\n\nviability, including, in some cases, certification by international and\n\ndomestic standards-setting bodies.\n\nReliance On Major Customers\n\nHistorically, the Company has relied on a limited number of customers for a\n\nsubstantial portion of its total revenues. In terms of total revenues, the\n\nCompany's\n\n11\n\n15\n\nlargest customer has been AT&T, although other large customers may purchase\n\nmore of any particular system or product line. The contribution of AT&T to the\n\nCompany's total revenues and percentage of total revenues for the nine months\n\nended September 30, 1996 and years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $1,970\n\nmillion (12.4%), $2,119 million (9.9%) and $2,137 million (10.8%),\n\nrespectively.\n\nIn addition, sales to approximately ten network operators (including AT&T),\n\nsome of which may vary from year to year, constituted approximately 38%, 41%\n\nand 42% of total revenues in the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993,\n\nrespectively. The Company has diversified its customer base in the past\n\nseveral years and expects this trend to continue. Nevertheless, the Company\n\nexpects that a significant portion of its future revenues will continue to be\n\ngenerated by a limited number of customers. See \"Business.\" The loss of any of\n\nthese customers or any substantial reduction in orders by any of these\n\ncustomers could materially adversely affect the Company's operating results.\n\nThe United States government is, in the aggregate, also a large customer of the\n\nCompany. Given the current pressures on the government to reduce its overall\n\nlevel of spending, there can be no assurance that government purchases from the\n\nCompany will not decrease in the future.\n\nMulti-Year Contracts\n\nIn recent years, the purchasing behavior of the Company's large customers\n\nhas increasingly been characterized by the use of fewer, larger contracts.\n\nThis trend is expected to intensify, and contributes to the variability of the\n\nCompany's results. Such larger purchase contracts typically involve longer\n\nnegotiating cycles, require the dedication of substantial amounts of working\n\ncapital and other resources, and in general require investments which may\n\nsubstantially precede recognition of associated revenues. Moreover, in return\n\nfor larger, longer-term purchase commitments, customers often demand more\n\nstringent performance and acceptance criteria which can also cause revenue\n\nrecognition delays and contract termination, as well as financing from the\n\nCompany. Certain multi-year contracts may involve new technologies which may\n\nnot have been previously deployed on a large-scale commercial basis. The\n\nCompany may incur significant initial cost overruns and losses on such\n\ncontracts which would be recognized in the quarter in which they became\n\nascertainable. Further, profit estimates on such contracts are revised\n\nperiodically over the lives of the contracts, and such revisions can have a\n\nsignificant impact on reported earnings in any one quarter.\n\nThe Company has several significant contracts for the sale of infrastructure\n\nsystems to network operators which extend over a multi-year period, and expects\n\nto enter into similar contracts in the future, with the uncertainties discussed\n\nabove. One of the Company's multi-year contracts is with Pacific Bell for the\n\nprovision of a broadband network based on hybrid fiber-coaxial cable\n\ntechnology. In July 1996, the Company and Pacific Bell agreed to modify the\n\nterms of the contract so as to resolve issues and potential claims which may\n\nhave arisen due to implementation difficulties and cost overruns under the\n\ncontract. The Company's financial statements include reserves to reflect these\n\ncontract modifications. The Company will continue to assess the adequacy of\n\nthese reserves.\n\nSeasonality\n\nThe Company's sales are highly seasonal with revenue and net income\n\nhistorically concentrated in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. Many of\n\nthe Company's large customers have historically delayed a disproportionate\n\npercentage of their capital expenditures until the fourth quarter of the\n\ncalendar year. The Company has placed an increased focus on the completion of\n\nsoftware releases by mid-year to allow for commercial availability and delivery\n\nin the fourth quarter of the calendar year. These software releases require\n\nsignificant research and development expenditures early in the year, with\n\nminimal offsetting revenues, but are key contributors to the Company's profits\n\nduring the fourth quarter of the calendar year. Additionally, sales of\n\nconsumer products are generally stronger in the fourth quarter, corresponding\n\nto holiday buying.\n\nThe growing competitive pressures among network operators, along with the\n\nincrease in software revenues, have resulted in an increasing trend toward\n\nseasonality. Consequently, the Company's results of operations for the first\n\nthree quarters of each calendar year historically have, in the aggregate, been\n\nsignificantly less profitable than the fourth quarter. The Company has\n\nreported net losses in the first quarter of\n\n12\n\n16\n\neach calendar year. The change in the Company's fiscal year to the year ending\n\nSeptember 30th will place the historically most profitable quarter as the first\n\nfiscal quarter.\n\nChange Of Company Brand Name\n\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company will, rapidly in the case of\n\nsome products and over specified periods of time in the case of other products,\n\nchange the trademarks and trade names under which it conducts its business.\n\nThe Company believes that its sale of business communications systems to small\n\nbusinesses and sales of consumer products have benefitted from the use of the\n\n\"AT&T\" brand name. The impact of the change in trademarks and trade names and\n\nother changes (including, without limitation, restrictions on the use of the\n\n\"AT&T\" brand name and related trade dress) on the Company's business and\n\noperations cannot be fully predicted. See \"Separation Agreements -- Brand\n\nLicense and Related Matters.\"\n\nFuture Capital Requirements\n\nThe Company's working capital requirements and cash flow provided by (or\n\nused in) operating activities can vary greatly from quarter to quarter,\n\ndepending on the volume of production, the timing of deliveries, the build-up\n\nof inventories, and the payment terms offered to customers.\n\nNetwork operators, domestically and internationally, increasingly have\n\nrequired their suppliers to arrange or provide long-term financing for them as\n\na condition to obtaining or bidding on infrastructure projects. These projects\n\nmay require financing in amounts ranging from modest sums to over a billion\n\ndollars. In this regard, the Company entered into a credit agreement in\n\nOctober 1996 to provide Sprint Spectrum LP long-term financing of $1,800\n\nmillion for purchasing equipment and services for its PCS network. Payment of\n\nquarterly interest on each borrowing may be deferred at the borrower's option\n\nfor up to two years. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\n\nStatements for a summary of other terms.) The Company is currently discussing\n\nwith financial institutions potential alternatives to sell loans it may make\n\nunder the credit agreement, which will depend, among other things, on the\n\nmarket conditions and requirements at the time. The Company has committed to,\n\nand is proposing, to provide financing where appropriate for its business, in\n\naddition to the Sprint Spectrum LP credit agreement. The ability of the\n\nCompany to arrange or provide financing for network operators will depend on a\n\nnumber of factors, including the Company's capital structure and level of\n\navailable credit.\n\nThe Company believes that its credit facilities, cash flow from operations\n\nand long- and short-term debt financings, will be sufficient to satisfy its\n\nfuture working capital, capital expenditure, research and development and debt\n\nservice requirements. The Company has a shelf registration statement to\n\nregister the possible offering from time to time of up to $2,000 million of\n\nlong-term debt at September 30, 1996. Although the Company believes that it\n\nwill be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts that will be\n\nsatisfactory to it, and that it will be able to obtain bid and performance\n\nbonds, to arrange or provide customer financing as necessary, and to engage in\n\nhedging transactions on commercially acceptable terms, there can be no\n\nassurance that the Company will be successful in this regard.\n\nInternational Growth And Foreign Exchange\n\nThe Company intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in\n\ninternational markets. In many international markets, long-standing\n\nrelationships between potential customers of the Company and their local\n\nproviders, and protective regulations, including local content requirements and\n\ntype approvals, create barriers to entry. In addition, pursuit of such\n\ninternational growth opportunities may require significant investments for an\n\nextended period before returns on such investments, if any, are realized. Such\n\nprojects and investments could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in\n\nthe opening of foreign markets to new competitors, exchange controls, currency\n\nfluctuations, investment policies, repatriation of cash, nationalization,\n\nsocial and political risks, taxation, and other factors, depending on the\n\ncountry in which such opportunity arises.\n\n- -------------------\n\n* SPRINT SPECTRUM is a service mark of Sprint Communications Company, L.P.\n\n13\n\n17\n\nA significant change in the value of the dollar against the currency of one\n\nor more countries where the Company recognizes substantial revenue or earnings\n\nmay materially adversely affect the Company's results. The Company attempts to\n\nmitigate any such effects through the use of foreign currency contracts,\n\nalthough there can be no assurances that such attempts will be successful.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nThe Company relies on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws\n\nboth to protect its proprietary technology and to protect the Company against\n\nclaims from others. The Company believes that it has direct intellectual\n\nproperty rights or rights under cross-licensing arrangements covering\n\nsubstantially all of its material technologies. Given the technological\n\ncomplexity of the Company's systems and products, however, there can be no\n\nassurance that claims of infringement will not be asserted against the Company\n\nor against the Company's customers in connection with their use of the\n\nCompany's systems and products, nor can there be any assurance as to the\n\noutcome of any such claims. The Company was assigned ownership of the\n\nsubstantial majority of AT&T's patents in connection with the Separation.\n\nPursuant to the patent license agreement entered into among the Company, AT&T\n\nand NCR, the Company has been given rights, subject to specified limitations,\n\nto pass through to its customers certain rights under approximately 400 patents\n\nretained by AT&T. There can be no assurance that the Company's customers and\n\npotential customers will be satisfied with the pass-through rights available to\n\nthem under the patents retained by AT&T or with any indemnification commitments\n\nthe Company may be willing to provide in connection therewith. See \"Separation\n\nAgreements -- Patent Licenses and Related Matters\" and \"-- Technology Licenses\n\nand Related Matters.\"\n\nOPERATING REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nFor information about the consolidated operating revenues contributed by the\n\nCompany's major classes of products and services, consolidated research and\n\ndevelopment expenses, and foreign and domestic operations, see revenue tables\n\nand discussion on pages 41 through 44, Consolidated Statements of Income on\n\npage 49 and Note 8 thereto on pages 60 and 61 of the Company's annual report\n\nto security holders for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1996. Such\n\ninformation is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to General Instruction\n\nG(2).\n\nEMPLOYEE RELATIONS\n\nAt September 30, 1996, the Company employed approximately 124,000 persons,\n\nof whom 79% were located in the United States. Of these domestic employees,\n\n46% are represented by unions, primarily the Communications Workers of\n\nAmerica and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\"IBEW\"). The\n\nCompany's labor agreements with these unions expire on May 30, 1998. Such\n\nunions have made claims against AT&T on behalf of the Company's employees they\n\nrepresent for severance pay as a result of the Distribution and related\n\ntransactions. The procedure under the labor contracts that these unions have\n\ninitiated is for the unions to file grievances to be followed by arbitration\n\nunder the contracts if the matter is not resolved. The IBEW claims are pending\n\ndecision following hearings in an arbitration proceeding. Under the Separation\n\nand Distribution Agreement among AT&T, the Company and NCR dated as of February\n\n1, 1996, and amended and restated as of March 29, 1996, the Company assumed\n\nresponsibility for liabilities for severance pay which might result from such\n\nclaims, subject to sharing arrangements under such Agreement. The Company has\n\ncontinued to honor its labor agreements with these unions. Although these\n\nclaims could be material, if upheld, the Company believes that such claims are\n\nwithout merit and intends to defend against the claims vigorously.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\nThe Company's current and historical manufacturing and research operations\n\nare subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws in the United\n\nStates and other countries. In the United States, these laws often require\n\nparties to fund remedial action regardless of fault. The Company has remedial\n\nand investigatory activities underway at 46 current and former facilities. In\n\naddition, the Company was named a successor to AT&T as a potentially\n\nresponsible party (\"PRP\") at numerous \"Superfund\" sites pursuant to the\n\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980\n\n(\"CERCLA\") or comparable state statutes. Under the terms of the Separation\n\n14\n\n18\n\nand Distribution Agreement, the Company is responsible for all liabilities\n\nprimarily resulting from or related to the operation of the Company's Business\n\nas conducted at any time prior to, on or after the Separation including related\n\nbusinesses discontinued or disposed of prior to the Separation, and the\n\nCompany's assets including, without limitation, those associated with these\n\nsites. In addition, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the\n\nCompany is required to pay a portion of contingent liabilities paid out in\n\nexcess of certain amounts by AT&T and NCR, including environmental liabilities.\n\nIt is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental\n\nmatters, including potential liabilities. The Company records an environmental\n\nreserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount\n\nof the liability is reasonably estimable. This practice is followed whether\n\nthe claims are asserted or unasserted. Management expects that the amounts\n\nreserved for will be paid out over the period of remediation for the applicable\n\nsite which ranges from 5 to 30 years. Reserves for estimated losses from\n\nenvironmental remediation are, depending on the site, based primarily upon\n\ninternal or third party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number,\n\nparticipation level and financial viability of any other PRPs, the extent of\n\nthe contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. Accruals are\n\nadjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. The amounts\n\nprovided for in the Company's consolidated financial statements in respect of\n\nenvironmental reserves are the gross undiscounted amount of such reserves,\n\nwithout deductions for insurance or third party indemnity claims. In those\n\ncases where insurance carriers or third party indemnitors have agreed to pay\n\nany amounts and management believes that collectibility of such amounts is\n\nprobable, the amounts are reflected as receivables in the financial statements.\n\nAlthough the Company believes that its reserves are adequate, there can be no\n\nassurance that the amount of capital expenditures and other expenses which will\n\nbe required relating to remedial actions and compliance with applicable\n\nenvironmental laws, will not exceed the amounts reflected in the Company's\n\nreserves or will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition\n\nof the Company or the Company's results of operations or cash flows. Any\n\namounts of environmental costs that may be incurred in excess of those provided\n\nfor at September 30, 1996 cannot be determined.\n\nOn July 31, 1991, the United States Environmental Protection Agency Region\n\nIII issued a complaint pursuant to Section 3008a of the Resource Conservation\n\nand Recovery Act of 1976 alleging violations of various waste management\n\nregulations at the Company's Richmond Works in Richmond, Virginia. The\n\ncomplaint alleges violations relating to training, solder dross management, the\n\nfacility's waste analysis plan and the handling of gold ion exchange resins.\n\nThe complaint seeks a total of $4.2 million in penalties. The Company is\n\ncontesting both liability and the penalties.\n\nIn addition, on July 31, 1991, the United States Environmental Protection\n\nAgency filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\n\nDistrict of Illinois against AT&T (with respect to the Company's businesses)\n\nand nine other parties seeking enforcement of its CERCLA Section 106 cleanup\n\norder, issued in November 1990 for the NL Granite City Superfund site in\n\nGranite, Illinois. This complaint seeks past costs, civil penalties of $25,000\n\nper day and treble damages related to certain United States costs. The Company\n\nis contesting liability.\n\nDuring 1994, AT&T Nassau Metals Corporation (\"Nassau\"), a wholly owned\n\nsubsidiary of the Company, and the New York State Department of Environmental\n\nConservation (the \"NYSDEC\") were engaged in negotiations over a study and\n\ncleanup of the Nassau plant located on Richmond Valley Road in Staten Island,\n\nNew York. During these negotiations, in June 1994, NYSDEC presented Nassau\n\nwith a draft consent order which included not only provisions for site\n\ninvestigation and remediation but also a provision for payment of a $3.5\n\nmillion penalty for alleged violations of hazardous waste management\n\nregulations. NYSDEC claims that Nassau improperly engaged in landfilling and\n\nstoring of lead dust. No formal proceeding has been commenced by NYSDEC.\n\nNegotiations and discussions regarding the matter are continuing.\n\nSEPARATION AGREEMENTS\n\nFor the purposes of governing certain of the relationships between the\n\nCompany and AT&T (including NCR) following the Separation and the Distribution,\n\nthe Company, AT&T and NCR entered into the Separation and Distribution\n\nAgreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which they are parties (collectively,\n\nthe \"Separation Agreements\"). The Ancillary Agreements include the Interim\n\nServices and Systems Replication Agreement;\n\n15\n\n19\n\nthe General Purchase Agreement and the supplemental agreements related thereto;\n\nthe Employee Benefits Agreement; the Brand License Agreement; the Patent\n\nLicense Agreement and other patent-related agreements; the Technology License\n\nAgreement and other technology-related agreements; the Tax Sharing Agreement\n\nand other tax-related agreements; certain agreements providing for the\n\nassignment of, and the establishment of transitional arrangements with respect\n\nto, real property; and agreements pursuant to which AT&T will provide\n\ncommunications services to the Company and NCR will sell certain products to\n\nthe Company. Certain of the Separation Agreements, including certain of the\n\nAgreements summarized below, have been filed as exhibits to this Form 10-K.\n\nReference is made to such exhibits for the full text of the provisions of those\n\nAgreements, and the agreement summaries below are qualified in their entirety\n\nby reference to the full text of such Agreements. Capitalized terms used in\n\nthis section and not otherwise defined in this Form 10-K shall have their\n\nrespective meanings set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement\n\n(except that the term \"Company\" is used in lieu of the term \"Lucent\") or other\n\nSeparation Agreement.\n\nSeparation And Distribution Agreement\n\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company assumed or\n\nagreed to assume, and agreed to perform and fulfill, all the \"Lucent\n\nLiabilities\" (as defined in such Agreement) in accordance with their respective\n\nterms. Without limitation, the Lucent Liabilities generally include all\n\nliabilities and contingent liabilities relating to Lucent's present and former\n\nbusiness and operations, and contingent liabilities otherwise assigned to\n\nLucent; contingent liabilities related to AT&T's discontinued computer\n\noperations (other than those of NCR) were assigned to the Company. The\n\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement provides for the sharing of contingent\n\nliabilities not allocated to one of the parties in specified proportions, and\n\nalso provides that each party will share specified portions of contingent\n\nliabilities related to the business of any of the other parties that exceed\n\nspecified levels.\n\nAbility to Terminate Certain Rights. The Separation and Distribution\n\nAgreement provides that certain rights granted to the Company and the members\n\nof the Company Group will be subject to the following provisions. Except as\n\notherwise expressly provided, in the event that, at any time prior to February\n\n1, 2001, the Company or any member of the Company Group offers, furnishes or\n\nprovides any Telecommunications Services of the type offered by the AT&T\n\nServices Business as of the Closing Date, then AT&T may, in its sole\n\ndiscretion: (a) terminate all or any portion of the rights granted by AT&T\n\nunder the Brand License Agreement; (b) terminate all or any remaining portion\n\nof the purchase commitments made by AT&T and the members of the AT&T Group in\n\nthe General Purchase Agreement; (c) exercise the right to require the Company\n\nto transfer to AT&T certain personnel, information, technology and software\n\nunder the Supplemental Agreements; (d) terminate all or any portion of the\n\nrights to patents and technology of AT&T or any member of the AT&T Group\n\ngranted to the Company and the members of the Company Group pursuant to the\n\nPatent License Agreement and the Technology License Agreement; and (e) direct\n\nthe Company and the members of the Company Group to reconvey to AT&T all\n\ninterests in any and all patents and technology in which the Company or any\n\nmember of the Company Group was granted an undivided one-half interest pursuant\n\nto the Patent Assignments or the Technology Assignment and Joint Ownership\n\nAgreements. The Company and the members of the Company Group will not be\n\ndeemed to offer, furnish or provide any Telecommunications Services (and the\n\nforegoing provisions will not apply) solely by virtue of certain specified\n\ninvestments in Persons that offer, furnish or provide Telecommunications\n\nServices or by virtue of offering, furnishing or providing Telecommunications\n\nServices below a specified de minimis amount.\n\nEmployee Benefits Agreement\n\nAT&T and the Company entered into the Employee Benefits Agreement that\n\ngoverns the employee benefit obligations of the Company, including both\n\ncompensation and benefits, with respect to active employees and retirees\n\nassigned to the Company. Pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement, the\n\nCompany assumed and agreed to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge, in\n\naccordance with their respective terms, all Liabilities (as defined) to, or\n\nrelating to, former employees of AT&T or its affiliates employed by the Company\n\nand its affiliates and certain former employees of AT&T or its affiliates\n\n(including retirees) who either were employed in the Company Business (as\n\ndefined) or who otherwise are assigned to the Company for purposes of\n\nallocating employee benefit obligations (including all retirees of Bell Labs).\n\n16\n\n20\n\nBrand License And Related Matters\n\nThe Company and AT&T entered into the Brand License Agreement pursuant to\n\nwhich the Company has rights, on a royalty-free basis, to continue to use the\n\nAT&T brand (including the AT&T globe design) for specified transition periods\n\nfollowing April 10, 1996. Under the Brand License Agreement, the Company will\n\nbe entitled to use the AT&T brand, alone or in combination with the Company's\n\nbrand, for the sale of consumer products and services and business\n\ncommunications systems and services until April 10, 1997. The Company will be\n\nentitled to continue to use the AT&T brand on these products, systems and\n\nservices, but only in combination with the Company's brand, for an additional\n\nthree-year period. The right to use the AT&T brand, alone or in combination\n\nwith the Company's brand, in connection with certain leased products or\n\nmaintenance contracts will extend until October 10, 2001. In addition, the\n\nCompany may use the AT&T brand after these time periods to the extent necessary\n\nto deplete pre-existing inventory. Subject to certain conditions set forth in\n\nthe Brand License Agreement, the Company may also extend these rights to use\n\nthe AT&T brand to authorized dealers of the Company's products, systems and\n\nservices.\n\nNeither the Company nor any of its authorized dealers is permitted to,\n\nduring the period it is using the AT&T brand, provide, offer or market\n\ntelecommunications services provided by any person other than AT&T with certain\n\nexceptions. AT&T may terminate the Brand License Agreement in the event of a\n\nsignificant breach (as defined therein), including in the event of a change of\n\ncontrol of the Company.\n\nPatent Licenses And Related Matters\n\nThe Company, AT&T and NCR executed and delivered assignments and other\n\nagreements, including a patent license agreement, related to patents then owned\n\nor controlled by AT&T and its subsidiaries. The patent assignments divided\n\nownership of patents, patent applications and foreign counterparts among the\n\nCompany, AT&T and NCR, with the substantial portion of those then owned or\n\ncontrolled by AT&T and its subsidiaries (other than NCR) being assigned to the\n\nCompany. A small number of the patents assigned to the Company are jointly\n\nowned with either AT&T or NCR. Certain of the patents that the Company jointly\n\nowns with AT&T are subject to a joint ownership agreement under which each of\n\nthe Company and AT&T has full ownership rights in the patents. The other\n\npatents that the Company jointly owns with AT&T, and the patents that the\n\nCompany jointly owns with NCR, are subject to defensive protection agreements\n\nwith AT&T and NCR, respectively, under which the Company holds most ownership\n\nrights in the patents exclusively. Under these defensive protection\n\nagreements, AT&T or NCR, as the case may be, has the ability, subject to\n\nspecified restrictions, to assert infringement claims under the patents against\n\ncompanies that assert patent infringement claims against them, and has consent\n\nrights in the event the Company wishes to license the patents to certain third\n\nparties or for certain fields of use under specified circumstances. The\n\ndefensive protection agreements also provide for one-time payments from AT&T\n\nand NCR to the Company.\n\nThe patent license agreement entered into by the Company, AT&T and NCR\n\nprovides for royalty-free cross-licenses to each company, under each of the\n\nother company's patents that are covered by the licenses, to use, lease, sell\n\nand import any and all products and services of the businesses in which the\n\nlicensed company (including specified related companies) is now or hereafter\n\nengaged. The cross-licenses also permit each company, subject to specified\n\nlimitations, to have third parties make items under the other companies'\n\npatents, as well as to pass through to customers certain rights under the other\n\ncompanies' patents with respect to products and services furnished to customers\n\nby the licensed company. In addition, the rights granted to the Company and\n\nAT&T include the right to license third parties under each of the other\n\ncompany's patents to the extent necessary to meet existing patent licensing\n\nobligations and AT&T has the right, subject to specified restrictions and\n\nprocedures, to seek sublicensing of a limited number of identified patents to\n\nbe assigned to the Company.\n\nTechnology Licenses And Related Matters\n\nThe Company, AT&T and NCR executed and delivered assignments and other\n\nagreements, including the Technology License Agreement, related to technology\n\nthen owned or controlled by AT&T and its subsidiaries. Technology includes\n\ncopyrights, mask works and other intellectual property other than trademarks,\n\ntrade names, trade dress, service marks and patent rights. The technology\n\nassignments divide ownership of\n\n17\n\n21\n\ntechnology among the Company, AT&T and NCR, with the Company and AT&T owning\n\ntechnology that was developed by or for, or purchased by, the Company's\n\nbusiness or AT&T's services business, respectively, and NCR owning technology\n\nthat was developed by or for, or purchased by, NCR. Technology that is not\n\ncovered by any of these categories is owned jointly by the Company and AT&T or,\n\nin the case of certain specified technology, owned jointly by the Company, AT&T\n\nand NCR.\n\nThe Technology License Agreement entered into by the Company, AT&T and NCR\n\nprovides for royalty-free cross-licenses to each company to use the other\n\ncompanies' technology existing as of April 10, 1996, except for specified\n\nportions of each company's technology as to which use by the other companies is\n\nrestricted or prohibited.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n\nAt September 30, 1996, the Company operated 58 manufacturing and repair\n\nsites, of which 23 were located in the United States, occupying in excess of\n\n20.0 million square feet, of which approximately 1.1 million square feet were\n\nleased. The remaining 35 sites were located in 19 countries.\n\nAt September 30, 1996, the Company operated 109 warehouse sites, of which 82\n\nwere located in the United States, occupying in excess of 3.0 million square\n\nfeet, substantially all of which were leased. The remaining 27 sites were\n\nlocated in 16 countries.\n\nAt September 30, 1996, the Company operated 882 office sites\n\n(administration, sales, field service), of which 677 were located in the United\n\nStates, occupying in excess of 19.0 million square feet, substantially all of\n\nwhich were leased. The remaining 205 sites were located in 47 countries.\n\nAt September 30, 1996, the Company operated additional sites in 15 cities,\n\nof which 14 were located in the United States, with significant research and\n\ndevelopment activities, occupying in excess of 9.0 million square feet, of\n\nwhich approximately 1.4 million square feet were leased.\n\nThe Company believes its plants and facilities are suitable and adequate,\n\nand have sufficient productive capacity, to meet its current needs.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings,\n\nlawsuits and other claims, including proceedings under laws and regulations\n\nrelated to environmental and other matters. (Also see Item 1. \"Business --\n\nSeparation Agreements -- Separation and Distribution Agreement\" regarding the\n\nassumption by the Company of certain liabilities and contingent liabilities.)\n\nAll such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not\n\npredictable with assurance. Consequently, the Company is unable to ascertain\n\nthe ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with\n\nrespect to these matters at September 30, 1996. While these matters could\n\naffect operating results of any one quarter when resolved in future periods\n\nand, while there can be no assurance with respect thereto, it is management's\n\nopinion that after final disposition, any monetary liability or financial\n\nimpact to the Company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet at\n\nSeptember 30, 1996 would not be material to the Company's annual consolidated\n\nfinancial statements.\n\nOn February 14, 1996, Bell Atlantic Corporation and DSC Communications\n\nCorporation filed a complaint against AT&T and the Company in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among\n\nother things, that AT&T or the Company has monopolized or attempted to\n\nmonopolize alleged markets for communications transmission equipment, related\n\nsoftware and caller identification services. The complaint seeks injunctive\n\nrelief and damages, after trebling, in excess of $3,500 million. AT&T and the\n\nCompany do not believe that the complaint has merit and intend to defend the\n\nlawsuit vigorously. This matter has been set for trial in March 1997.\n\nSee also the discussion in Item 1. \"Business -- Employee Relations\" and \"--\n\nEnvironmental Matters\" for additional legal proceedings, and environmental\n\nmatters and proceedings.\n\n18\n\n22\n\nITEM 4.
