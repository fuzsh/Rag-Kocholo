        "text": "Yellow Corporation Renames Subsidiary Yellow Technologies, Inc OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Jan. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovation is about to become a more visible part of the Yellow brand. Yellow Corporation (Nasdaq: YELL) announced today that it is renaming its 400-person technology development subsidiary, Yellow Technologies, Inc.\n\nPreviously named Yellow Services, Inc., the subsidiary has been responsible for all information technology support and a variety of corporate and administrative shared services functions. The new name reflects Yellow Technologies' current focus on development and deployment of state-of-the-art information technology and related systems that support operations at all transportation services subsidiaries.\n\n\"Yellow Technologies has long been one of the real hidden assets in the Yellow Corporation family of companies,\" said Bill Zollars, Chairman, President and CEO of Yellow Corporation. \"They have provided the technology and telecommunications tools that have enabled us to make significant operational and process improvements throughout the company in recent years. The name change to Yellow Technologies reflects the real value of what they provide -- the technology innovation that has returned Yellow to its long-time industry leadership position.\"\n\n\"With so many of our routine business transactions migrating to the internet and the quickly evolving e-commerce business opportunities today, our focus as an organization has to be on technology development and deployment,\" said Lynn Caddell, President of Yellow Technologies. \"Our new name is a better fit with what we are actually doing as an organization.\"\n\nYellow recently was named a winner of the 1999 CIO-100 Award given by CIO magazine in recognition of excellence in technology, operations and strategic thinking. CIO described Yellow as a \"rapidly growing organization using technology to get closer to its customers\" and especially praised Yellow for its interactive web site. In winning the award, Yellow joined other companies like 3M, Amazon.com, AT&T, Coca Cola, DaimlerChrysler, FedEx, Hallmark, Home Depot, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Lucent, Microsoft, Southwest Airlines and Wal-Mart.\n\nYellow Corporation is a holding company with operating subsidiaries specializing in national, regional and international transportation of goods and materials. Headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, Yellow employs approximately 32,000 people.\n\nSOURCE Yellow Corporation\n\nCONTACT: Roger Dick, APR of Yellow Corporation, 913-696-6184, or roger.dick@yellowcorp.com"
