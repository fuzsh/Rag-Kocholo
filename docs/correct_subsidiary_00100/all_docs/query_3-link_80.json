        "text": "Paris - Alcatel-Lucent and NTT recently announced that they have signed a collaborative agreement focusing on optical packet switching technologies. The collaborative agreement was signed yesterday between Alcatel-Lucent's Bell Labs research organization and NTT's Photonics Labs in a private signing ceremony.\n\nThe continuing demand for innovations in packet transport networks are driven by several factors including: the emergence of very-high bandwidth subscribers, notably with FTTx deployments on a large scale; new reduced power consumption and footprint specifications; and low latency applications such as storage area network (SAN) or grid computing. Through this agreement Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs and NTT Photonics will cooperate in investigations on optical packet switching technology, including transport multi-protocol label switching (T-MPLS), the initial version of MPLS Transport. Specific terms and conditions of the agreement were not disclosed.\n\n\"We are pleased to collaborate with Alcatel-Lucent on this project - one that represents a significant occasion to combine our well-proven research capabilities with Bell Labs' market-leading expertise in optical networking to raise the bar of technology innovation and benefit end-users,\" said Yoshio Itaya, director of NTT science and core technology laboratory group.\n\n\"We are looking forward to taking the next step in Alcatel-Lucent's already close and successful research and development cooperation with NTT,\" said Jean-Luc Beylat, head of business partnerships at Alcatel-Lucent's Bell Labs. \"As the demand for technology innovation continues to increase, this collaborative agreement is a powerful opportunity for two world class research organizations to collaborate in addressing the very complex challenges in the next generation of optical networks."
