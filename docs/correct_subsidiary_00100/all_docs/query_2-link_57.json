        "text": "Buy and Sell Used Alcatel-Lucent Networking Equipment\n\nAlcatel-Lucent hardware has been designed to help you improve network efficiency, increase overall reliability and reduce the TCO of your transport networks. You can secure these great improvements at a significantly reduced cost when you buy used Alcatel-Lucent networking equipment to bolster your existing IT infrastructure.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Network Products\n\nAlthough the Alcatel-Lucent name has largely disappeared after Nokia purchased the company in 2016, Worldwide Supply is pleased to carry refurbished editions of its top-flight technology.\n\nAlthough Alcatel-Lucent was the result of a merger in 2006, the company’s predecessors had been involved in telecommunications since the late part of the 19th century — Western Electric Manufacturing Company and La Compagnie Générale d’Electricité (CGE).\n\nWestern Electric was at one time the largest electrical manufacturing company in the U.S., and in 1880, American Bell Telephone Company, which would one day become AT&T, acquired a controlling interest in the company and made it the top manufacturer of equipment for the Bell companies.\n\nCGE was founded in 1898 in Alsace. As the decades passed, CGE became known as a leader in digital communication. It is perhaps best known around the world for manufacturing France’s TGV high-speed trains.\n\nYears passed, and names and times changed. CGE became Alcatel and Bell became AT&T. In 1996, AT&T spun off Lucian Technologies, which was the successor to Western Electric. Ten years later, to combat intense competition in the telecommunications industry, Alcatel and Lucent Technologies merged. The new company was headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, France.\n\nThe company targeted fixed mobile and convergent networking hardware and IP technologies. Eventually, it was operating in more than 130 countries. In 2014, for the fourth consecutive year, it was listed in the Thomson Reuters Top 100 Global Innovators category. It also owned Bell Laboratories, one of the top research and development operations in the communications field. Its scientists and developers had won eight Nobel prizes, and the company itself had 29,000 patents.\n\nIn November 2016, the Finnish company Nokia completed its acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent and merged it into their Nokia networks division.\n\nSelect an Alcatel-Lucent Product Type:\n\nLifetime Warranty on Alcatel-Lucent Hardware\n\nThanks to Worldwide Supply’s Lifetime Warranty on used Alcatel-Lucent products, you can buy with complete confidence. Our ISO 9001:2008 and TL 9000 Quality Management Systems certifications will give you the peace-of-mind of knowing your equipment will integrate properly and work correctly the first time. Refurbished Alcatel-Lucent equipment is a smart investment that can help you save money when you choose the right partner to deliver your equipment. Browse our full selection of Alcatel-Lucent Equipment below.\n\nBuy Alcatel-Lucent Equipment\n\nBuy used Alcatel-Lucent networking equipment from Worldwide Supply, and experience savings of up to 90% on every investment. Some of our best-selling used Alcatel-Lucent products include:\n\nAlcatel-Lucent 7250 Services Access Switches\n\nAlcatel-Lucent 7450 Ethernet Service Switch\n\nAlcatel-Lucent 7705 Service Access Router\n\nAlcatel-Lucent 7710 Service Router\n\nAlcatel-Lucent 7750 Service Routers\n\nAlcatel-Lucent MDR-4000 Microwave Radios\n\nAlcatel-Lucent MDR-5000 Microwave Radios\n\nAlcatel-Lucent MDR-6000 Microwave Radios\n\nAlcatel-Lucent MDR-8000 Microwave Radios\n\nAlcatel – MODCELL Base Stations\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Base Stations\n\nAn early leader in modular cell base station technology, Alcatel-Lucent focused on high capacity and state-of-the-art equipment. At Worldwide Supply, you’ll find a vast selection of Alcatel Lucent Modcell base stations. These base stations deliver the very best carrier density side-by-side with immediate OPEX savings. They support multiple carriers or sectors per frame.\n\nOur knowledgeable and expert team of engineers will know the exact model that will help your network, whether it is an indoor or an outdoor situation, that enables growth and makes maintenance significantly easier for your operation. If you are looking for a way to expand your network affordably and securely, Alcatel-Lucent equipment remains one of your best options.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Central Office Switching\n\nWhen you network demands strength, you’ll find it with Alcatel-Lucian Central Office Switching equipment. Flexibility and smart routing give you the long distant support that networks and carriers require as a result of ever-increasing demand. Worldwide Supply carries refurbished versions of the Alcatel-Lucent 4ESS, the 5ESS, the 7250 SAS, the DEX-STP, the DExECS1, and the MegaHub.\n\nOur OEM-certified engineers restore every piece of used equipment we acquire to industry standards. Our state-of-the-art repair and testing facility means that the piece of Alcatel-Lucent central office switching equipment you acquire from Worldwide Supply provides at the same strength and services as the OEM, but at a price your budget can afford.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent DACS\n\nAlcatel-Lucent DACS equipment offers solid reliability, functionality and broad support for improved networking protocols. They are much sought after as digital electronic cross-connect systems. When Nokia took over Alcatel-Lucent, it also took over a large portfolio of the former company’s telecom equipment. But Nokia only offers minimal unlimited support for many of the units because some of the product lines have been discontinued.\n\nInstead of operating in a haze of complexity to find the support you need, come to Worldwide Supply. We carry a complete line of used and refurbished Alcatel-Lucent DACS equipment including power cards, parts and more. It can be quite a challenge to follow the bouncing ball of who owns an older technology and the tech needed for fixes. That’s why Worldwide Supply is an OEM-neutral source. We take the worry out of keeping your network operational.\n\nCurrently, we can provide you with the following Alcatel-Lucent DACS equipment at prices that won’t hurt your bottom line — the Alcatel-Lucent 1631-SX, the DACS II, the DACS III, the DACS IV and the DEXCS1.\n\nAlcatel-Lucian DSLAM\n\nAlcatel-Lucent has a comprehensive selection of smart DSLAM networking devices including the 7330 ISAM and the Stinger LIMs.\n\nThe 7330 Intelligent Services Access Manager is a full-service IP access node. At 19 inches, it’s perfect for small cabinets or central offices and can be essential to fiber-to-node deployment. If your subscribers want a robust triple-play option, this compact ISAM unit is what you need.\n\nThese refurbished models provide very fast high-speed broadband services over copper and support as many as 10 P2P fiber, voice line, DSL and splitter card slots with their flexible, high-density shelves. Each unit can look after up to 480 subscribers.\n\nWorldwide Supply offers remote expansion modules that can bring high-quality voice and video services to a platform supporting mobile backhauling and other features you need for your business.\n\nMeanwhile, Stinger LIMs support a wide range of new and old standards. It uses ADSL, ADSL2+ and related line protocols. A word of caution — the line itself originated before ADSL 2+ protocols, so any legacy Stingers on your network probably will not support the new systems that you need. But when you order refurbished Stinger modules from Worldwide Supply, they will work with the ADSL2+ technologies, and any other new capabilities based on the TA OS software is supported.\n\nThere are four different types of Stinger LIMs. Our fully trained technicians and service professionals will ensure you’re getting exactly the right piece of refurbished technology for your network’s needs.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Microwave Radios\n\nYou can find an Alcatel-Lucent Microwave Radio that you can use as a cost-effective alternative for improving your speeds for data and digital voice. Since Nokia provides only limited support for many of these models, refurbished Alcatel-Lucent microwave radios from Worldwide Supply means that you can find a good fit for most networks and applications both domestically and internationally at a great price that comes with solid dependability.\n\nWhether you’re looking for an economical MDR-4000, a top-of-the-line MDR-9500 or one of the many models in between, Worldwide Supply has it. The MDR-5000 is renowned for its decades of reliable service, the MDR-6000 was revolutionary when it first hit the market, and the MDR-8000 provides much faster deployments and simpler maintenance compared to wireline options or large fiber copter facilities.\n\nIf you’re unsure which unit is best for your network, please contact our team of highly trained professionals who can talk to you about any of the Alcatel-Lucent microwave radios carried by Worldwide Supply, and which one is the best for your network.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Multiservice Platforms\n\nIf you’re looking to provide more than one communication service type using the same infrastructure, Worldwide Supply has a large selection of Alcatel-Lucent multiservice platforms. They offer the ability for a single network to support multiple applications without degrading any of their quality of service. Worldwide Supply refurbished Alcatel-Lucent multiservice platforms are perfect for anyone who is providing wireless or wireline communication networking solutions over an extended period.\n\nWorldwide Supply has many multiservice platforms to choose from, depending upon your need. If you are confused about which one will work best for your network and give you the improved service you desire at a great price, please talk with our experienced professional technicians.\n\nWorldwide supply carries Alcatel-Lucent 1660SM, 1665, 1675 LambdaUnite, 7250 SAS, 7450, 7470, CBX-500, DMXtend, MAX TNT, Metropolis DMX, 7750 SR-1 SR-12, 7670, 7705 SAR, 7710 SR, PSAX-2300, and PSAX-1250.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Optical Transport\n\nMany years ago, all a telecommunications company needed to worry about concerning network traffic was a voice call transmitted over circuit-based networks and a connection between two endpoints. In other words, a telephone call. These days network traffic is a whole different ballgame. It’s packet-based and created by a plethora of applications and services that occur in unpredictable, often bursty, patterns. This creates greater demands on bandwidth and transmission.\n\nOptical transport offers an enhanced capability that allows different traffic types — digital video, ethernet and SONED/SDH for instance — to be transmitted on a single optical transport frame.\n\nWorldwide Supply offers a broad range of refurbished Alcatel-Lucent optical transport equipment for your business, whether it is small or large.\n\nWhatever your optical transport need, Worldwide Supply can work with you to find the perfect solution. We offer Alcatel-Lucent 1603 SM, DDM-1000, DDM-2000, FT-2000, WaveStar ADM-16/1, WaveStar OLS 2.5G, WaveStar OLS 10G, and WaveStar OLS 400G.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent Subscriber Carrier\n\nIf you need to enhance your network structures and capabilities, you should look at the Alcatel-Lucent subscriber carriers offered by Worldwide Supply. These systems are affordable and help you make the most of your current network at a fraction of the cost of much newer fiber equipment. This is especially helpful for smaller carriers that have not made the move yet the fiber.\n\nThese Alcatel-Lucent subscriber carriers are tough as they come. Despite some of these models being discontinued and receiving limited service from Nokia, refurbished models offered by Worldwide Supply are keeping many networks robust and capable in changing times. For instance, the SLC-2000 survived the gale-force winds of Hurricane Andrew with no downtime. They also provided the backbone of support for the 1996 Summer Olympics. That’s the kind of reliability your network deserves.\n\nIn addition to the rugged SLC-2000 Worldwide Supply offers the AnyMedia Access, LiteSpan 4000, LiteSpan 7201, and SLC-5.\n\nSell Your Used Alcatel-Lucent Network Equipment\n\nWorldwide Supply is always looking for a wide variety of networking hardware and telecom networking equipment, including Alcatel-Lucent network equipment. We will help you receive the maximum value for your surplus and used networking equipment and telecom hardware.\n\nGet upfront cash at highly competitive rates while we handle the removal of all networking equipment. You’ll receive competitive payments that you can invest in your business or put towards a trade for other new or refurbished equipment.\n\nWorldwide Supply is your partner for selling and buying used Alcatel-Lucent networking equipment.\n\nLet Worldwide Supply Fulfill Your Alcatel-Lucent Hardware and Networking Equipment Needs\n\nIf you’re thinking of upgrading, replacing or installing Alcatel-Lucent equipment in your enterprise, consider what Worldwide Supply has to offer.
