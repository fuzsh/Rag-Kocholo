        "text": "Last updated December 2018\n\nYour privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data Lucent Sky processes, how Lucent Sky processes it, and for what purposes.\n\nThis privacy statement applies to websites and services of Lucent Sky that collect data and display these terms, as well as its offline product support services. It does not apply to those Lucent Sky websites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.\n\nLucent Sky collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Lucent Sky and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.\n\nIf you represent an organization, such as a business or government agency, that utilizes Lucent Sky's Products, please see the Enterprise Products section of this statement to learn how we process your data.\n\nYou have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Some of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data necessary to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you are using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.\n\nLucent Sky uses the data we collect to provide you pleasant experiences. In particular, we use data to:\n\nProvide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request;\n\nImprove and develop our products;\n\nPersonalize our products and make recommendations; and\n\nAdvertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you relevant offers.\n\nWe also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, and doing research.\n\nIn carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of a Lucent Sky product and its support website) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.\n\nYou can also make choices about Lucent Sky's collection and use of your data. You can control your personal data that Lucent Sky has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, by contacting Lucent Sky or using various tools we provide. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which Products you use.\n\nIn any case, you can inform Lucent Sky by using this web form about your wish to access and clear your data. These choices do not apply to the receipt of mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain Lucent Sky services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service.\n\nCookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign-in, providing interest-based advertising, combating fraud, analyzing how our products perform, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes.\n\nWe also use “web beacons” to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies, or similar technologies from third-party service providers.\n\nYou have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your Internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking cookies."
