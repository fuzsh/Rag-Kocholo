        "text": "Nokia has agreed to buy its smaller French rival Alcatel-Lucent in a 15.6 billion Euro ($16.6 billion) all-stock deal, likely to close in the first half of next year. The combined entity, to be called Nokia Corporation, will become the second largest mobile equipment manufacturer in the world with an estimated market share of 35%, close behind Swedish giant Ericsson which has an estimated 40% share. Alcatel-Lucent’s CEO Michel Combes stated in an interview following the deal announcement that Nokia had initially approached Alcatel to buy only its wireless business but, after getting rebuffed, agreed to buy the whole company.\n\nIn addition to positioning it as a top player in the telecom gear market, the deal will help Nokia expand its product portfolio in the domains of optical transmission and Internet Protocol (routers and switches), which are essential components in building a complete network. A comprehensive networking product line (wireless and wireline) along with advanced research capabilities for development of future technologies such as software-defined networking and cloud computing will give Nokia an edge over market leader Ericsson, which currently offers only wireless networking equipment and services. This deal will also provide strategic geographic benefits to Nokia by positioning it as a strong telecom gear player in Europe, China as well as in the profitable U.S. market. It is pertinent to note that Alcatel-Lucent is a very strong player in the U.S. wireless equipment market, having long standing contracts with the major carriers- Verizon and AT&T , as well as in the global service provider router market with the second highest share after Cisco.\n\nPer the terms of the deal, Nokia will offer 0.55 shares of the new company in exchange for each ordinary share and each American Depository Share of Alcatel-Lucent. This will effectively provide Alcatel-Lucent shareholders 33.5% ownership of the combined entity, with the remaining 66.5% owned by Nokia shareholders, subject to approvals and full acceptance of the tender offer. The deal is surprisingly simple, with no complicated corporate governance structures, which seems to be playing an important role in convincing Nokia’s shareholders that this deal is likely to be handled better than its earlier troubled joint venture with Siemens.\n\nOur $8 price estimate for Nokia is about in line with the current market price.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Nokia stock here\n\nFinancial Benefits For Nokia\n\nNokia stated that, owing to its overlapping and complementary portfolios with Alcatel-Lucent, it should be able to report operating cost synergies of EUR 900 million by 2019 and approximately EUR 200 million in interest expense reductions by 2017. Both companies will also immensely benefit from their strong R&D divisions which employ a total of 40,000 employees and had investments of EUR 4.7 billion in 2014. The similar and complementary nature of the companies’ product portfolios should enable more effective utilization of R&D resources, which will likely help cut down R&D expenses from their current 17-18% (of sales) levels. This is also likely to be aided by an expanding top line, which Nokia expects to grow at a slightly higher rate of 3.5% in the 2014-19 period, post the deal.\n\nThe agreement to acquire Alcatel-Lucent is an all-share deal means that there will be no cash payout to the shareholders. This essentially implies that the 15.6 billion Euro ($16.6 billion) deal will not be overly taxing for Nokia. In addition, the combined entity will have net cash of EUR 5.3 billion which should help Nokia improve its credit rating.\n\nRisks\n\nAlthough there is a lot of potential for the Nokia-Alcatel-Lucent entity in the near future, the deal also carriers a host of risks. It has been difficult to integrate such R&D intensive businesses in the past, with Nokia-Siemens and Alcatel-Lucent themselves being prime examples. There is also the issue of job cuts, which will likely happen due to the overlapping nature of both businesses. Since France has clearly stated that protecting research jobs in the country will be key to gaining its support, job cuts are likely to take place in Nokia’s home country Finland, where its employee strength currently stands at 6,900.\n\nAlcatel-Lucent’s 2014 Performance\n\nAlcatel-Lucent had formulated to restructure itself from a telecom equipment generalist to an industry specialist in IP networking and Ultra-Broadband access in 2013, and it is benefiting from this ongoing repositioning, known as the “The Shift Plan”. 2014 marked the first year of positive free cash flows (excluding restructuring) for the company since Alcatel and Lucent’s merger in 2006, and improving margins along with significant cost reductions should help it achieve its target of overall positive free cash flows (including restructuring) this year. Its full year 2014 revenue and net loss stood at EUR 13.2 billion and EUR 118 million, respectively. This translates to a loss of 4 cents per share in 2014 against a loss of 54 cents in 2013.\n\nIn terms of business segments, IP Routing sales grew 6% year-over-year on the back of share improvement (to 26%) in the global IP Edge Router market as well as new contract wins in IP Core Router and IP Transport. Wireless revenue grew 4% y-o-y to about EUR 4.7 billion on the back of robust LTE-related investments in the U.S. and China. The company added 76 new contracts to its kitty in the whole year, including in Europe and the Middle-East. Alcatel-Lucent has a share of around 10% in the global wireless infrastructure market, valued currently at about EUR 33 billion.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research"
