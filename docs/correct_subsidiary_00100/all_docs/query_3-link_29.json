These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference, including, but not limited to, Lucent's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 1999, including any amendments. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this prospectus.

THE COMPANY Lucent designs, builds and delivers a wide range of public and private networks, communications systems and software, data networking systems, business telephone systems and microelectronic components. Lucent is a global leader in the sale of public communications systems, and is a supplier of systems or software to most of the world's largest network operators. Lucent is also a global leader in the sale of business communications systems and in the sale of microelectronic components for communications applications to manufacturers of communications systems and computers. Lucent conducts its research and development activities through Bell Laboratories, one of the world's foremost industrial research and development organizations. Lucent was incorporated in Delaware in November 1995. Lucent was a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T prior to its initial public offering of common stock on April 10, 1996, and 5 7 became completely separate from AT&T when the remaining shares of Lucent common stock held by AT&T were distributed to AT&T's stockholders on September 30, 1996. On March 1, 2000 Lucent announced a plan to spin off its PBX, SYSTIMAX(R) structured cabling and LAN-based data businesses to its stockholders, forming a separate company named Avaya Inc. that will focus directly and independently on the enterprise networking market. The spin-off is expected to be accomplished through a tax-free distribution of shares to Lucent's stockholders to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, which ends on September 30. On July 20, 2000, Lucent announced plans to spin off its microelectronics business, which includes the optoelectronics components and integrated circuits divisions, in a separate, new company to be named later. An initial public offering is planned for up to 20 percent of the new company in the first calendar quarter of 2001, with the remaining shares of the new company expected to be spun off in a tax-free distribution by the summer of 2001. Lucent intends to seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax-free treatment of the distribution. The distribution is subject to certain conditions, including obtaining a favorable tax ruling. The new company will include Lucent's microelectronics business which makes silicon chips and optoelectronic components, such as lasers, that are the building blocks for communications systems ranging from wireless phones and modems to Internet equipment and optical networking systems. The principal executive offices of Lucent are located at 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 and its telephone number at that location is (908) 582-8500. SELLING SECURITYHOLDERS The following table sets forth (1) the number of shares of Lucent common stock owned by each of the selling securityholders as of July 28, 2000; (2) the percentage of outstanding shares of Lucent common stock represented by that number of shares; and (3) the number of shares of Lucent common stock registered for sale hereby. No estimate can be given as to the amount of shares that will be held by the selling securityholders after completion of this offering because the selling securityholders may offer all or some of the shares and because there currently are no agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale of any of the shares. The shares offered by this prospectus may be offered from time to time by the selling securityholders named below. <TABLE> <CAPTION> SHARES PERCENTAGE OF NUMBER OF SHARES BENEFICIALLY OUTSTANDING SHARES REGISTERED FOR SALE SELLING SECURITYHOLDER(1) OWNED(2) OWNED HEREBY(3) ------------------------- --------- ----- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Access Technology Partners, L.P. 902,568 * 902,568 Access Technology Partners Brokers Fund, L.P. 18,052 * 18,052 ACE Investment Partnership 124,899 * 124,899 Leni A.

Lucent Venture Partners I LLC holds the shares listed in the table above for itself and a number of other individuals other than Lucent. These individuals include John Hanley, President of Lucent Venture Partners I LLC and an officer of Lucent, and certain other employees of Lucent and its affiliates. None of the other selling securityholders were officers or directors of Chromatis prior to Lucent's acquisition of Chromatis and none of the selling securityholders are officers or directors of Lucent. Except as otherwise noted above, none of the selling securityholders has had a material relationship with Lucent within the past three years other than as a result of the ownership of the shares or other securities of Lucent. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION RESALES BY SELLING SECURITYHOLDERS Lucent is registering the shares on behalf of the selling securityholders. Any or all of the selling securityholders may offer the shares from time to time, either in increments or in a single transaction. The selling securityholders may also decide not to sell all the shares they are allowed to sell under this prospectus. The selling securityholders will act independently of Lucent in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale. DONEES, PLEDGEES AND DISTRIBUTEES The term \"selling securityholders\" includes donees, persons who receive shares from the selling securityholders after the date of this prospectus by gift. The term also includes pledgees, persons who, upon contractual default by the selling securityholders, may seize shares which the selling securityholders pledged to such persons. The term also includes distributees who receive shares from a selling securityholder after the date of this prospectus as a distribution to members or partners of the selling securityholder. 10 12 COSTS AND COMMISSIONS Lucent will pay all costs, expenses and fees in connection with the registration of the shares. The selling securityholders will pay all brokerage commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of shares. TYPES OF SALE TRANSACTIONS The selling securityholders will act independently of Lucent in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale. The selling securityholders may sell the shares in one or more types of transactions (which may include block transactions): - on the NYSE, - in negotiated transactions, - through the writing of options on shares, - short sales, or - any combination of such methods of sale. The shares may be sold at a fixed offering price, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. Such transactions may or may not involve brokers or dealers. SALES TO OR THROUGH BROKER-DEALERS The selling securityholders may either sell shares directly to purchasers, or sell shares to, or through, broker-dealers. These broker-dealers may act either as an agent of the selling securityholders, or as a principal for the broker-dealer's own account. Such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the selling securityholders and/or the purchasers of shares. This compensation may be received both if the broker-dealer acts as an agent or as a principal. This compensation might also exceed customary commissions. The selling securityholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers in connection with distributions of the shares or otherwise. In such transactions, broker-dealers may engage in short sales of the shares in the course of hedging the positions they assume with selling securityholders. The selling securityholders also may sell shares short and re-deliver the shares to close out such short positions. The selling securityholders may enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers which require the delivery to the broker-dealer of the shares. The broker-dealer may then resell or otherwise transfer such shares pursuant to this prospectus. The selling securityholders also may loan or pledge the shares to a broker-dealer. The broker-dealer may sell the shares so loaned, or upon a default the broker-dealer may sell the pledged shares pursuant to this prospectus. 11 13 DEEMED UNDERWRITING COMPENSATION The selling securityholders and any broker-dealers that act in connection with the sale of shares might be deemed to be \"underwriters\" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. Any commissions received by such broker-dealers, and any profit on the resale of shares sold by them while acting as principals, could be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the Securities Act. INDEMNIFICATION The selling securityholders may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving sales of shares against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act. PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS Because a selling securityholder may be deemed an underwriter, the selling securityholder must deliver this prospectus and any supplements to this prospectus in the manner required by the Securities Act. This might include delivery through the facilities of the NYSE in accordance with Rule 153 under the Securities Act. SALES UNDER RULE 144 The selling securityholders may also resell all or a portion of the shares in open market transactions in reliance upon Rule 144 under the Securities Act. To do so, the selling securityholders must meet the criteria and comply with the requirements of Rule 144. DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS WITH BROKER-DEALERS If the selling securityholders notify Lucent that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of shares through: - a block trade, - special offering, - exchange distribution or secondary distribution, or - a purchase by a broker or dealer, then Lucent will file, if required, a supplement to this prospectus under Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. The supplement will disclose, to the extent required: - the name of such selling securityholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), - the number of shares involved, - the price at which such shares were sold, 12 14 - the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, - that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and any other facts material to the transaction. USE OF PROCEEDS Lucent will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling securityholders. LEGAL MATTERS The legality of Lucent common stock offered by this prospectus will be passed upon for Lucent by Jean F. Rankin, Vice President--Law, of Lucent. As of July 28, 2000 Jean F. Rankin owned 121 shares of Lucent common stock and options and stock units for 145,200 shares of Lucent common stock. EXPERTS The financial statements incorporated in this prospectus by reference in Exhibit 99.1 to Lucent's Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 11, 2000, have been so incorporated in reliance on the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, given on the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting. 13 15 PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS ITEM 14.

ITEM 15. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The registrant's Certificate of Incorporation provides that a director of the registrant shall not be personally liable to the registrant or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except, if required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, for liability (1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the registrant or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which concerns unlawful payments of dividends, stock purchases or redemptions or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Neither the amendment nor repeal of such provision shall eliminate or reduce the effect of such provision in respect of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for such provision, would accrue or arise prior to such amendment or repeal. While the registrant's Certificate of Incorporation provides directors with protection from awards for monetary damages for breach of their duty of care, it does not eliminate such duty. Accordingly, the registrant's Certificate of Incorporation will have no effect on the availability of equitable remedies such as an injunction or rescission based on a director's breach of his or her duty of care. II-1 16 The registrant's Certificate of Incorporation provides that each person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a \"proceeding\"), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person of whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the registrant or is or was serving at the request of the registrant as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the registrant to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the registrant to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the registrant to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith. Such right to indemnification includes the right to have the registrant pay the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, subject to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Such rights are not exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the registrant's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. No repeal or modification of such provision will in any way diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director, officer, employee or agent of the registrant thereunder in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification. The registrant's Certificate of Incorporation also specifically authorizes the registrant to maintain insurance and to grant similar indemnification rights to employees or agents of the registrant. The directors and officers of the registrant are covered by insurance policies indemnifying them against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act, which might be incurred by them in such capacities. ITEM 16. EXHIBITS. See index to exhibits. ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS. A. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: (i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\"); (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, II-2 17 individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission under Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the \"Calculation of Registration Fee\" table in the effective registration statement; (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; Provided, however, that paragraphs (A)(1)(i) and (A)(1)(ii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in periodic reports filed by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement. (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. B. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrant's annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. C. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. II-3 18 D. The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. II-4 19 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Murray Hill, State of New Jersey on July 28, 2000.

Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the shares of Lucent Common Stock specified in Section 1.5(c), without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.9, of the certificate or certificates that were formerly evidenced by such Dissenting Shares less the number of shares of Lucent Common Stock allocable to such stockholder that have been deposited in the Escrow Fund in respect of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Sections 1.9(b) and 8.1.

In lieu of receiving any such fractional share, the stockholder shall receive cash (without interest) in an amount rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.

Lucent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the cash necessary for this purpose. 1.9 Exchange Procedures; Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Stock Transfer Books. (a) As of the Effective Time, Lucent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, certificates representing shares of the Lucent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5(c) in exchange for the shares of Company Capital Stock less the number of shares of Lucent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.1. Such shares of Lucent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Sections 1.8 and 1.9(c), are referred to herein as the \"Exchange Fund\". (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Lucent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to send to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of certificates which represented outstanding Company Capital Stock (the \"Certificates\") which shares were converted into the right to receive Lucent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(c), a letter of transmittal which (i) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery thereof to the Exchange Agent and (ii) shall contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, such holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Lucent Common Stock into which the Company Capital Stock represented by the surrendered Certificate shall have been converted at the Effective Time less such holder's pro rata portion of the number of shares of Lucent Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Section 8.1, (B) cash in lieu of any fractional share of Lucent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.8 and (C) certain dividends and distributions in accordance with Section 1.9(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall then be canceled. Subject to Section 1.8 and Section 1.9(c), until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.9(b), each Certificate from and after the Effective Time shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the number of shares of Lucent Common Stock into which such Company Capital Stock shall have been converted. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 8, Lucent shall cause to be issued to the Escrow Agent certificates representing approximately 10% of the shares of Lucent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for the Company Capital Stock, which shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent as nominee for the holders of Certificates canceled pursuant to this Section 1.9. Such shares shall be beneficially owned by such holders, shall be held in escrow and shall be available to compensate Lucent as provided in Section 8. To the extent not used for such purpose, such shares shall be released, as provided in Section 8. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Lucent shall cause to be issued to the Supplemental Escrow Agent certificates representing approximately 10% of the shares of Lucent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for the Company Capital Stock of the Key Founders, which shall be registered in the name of the Supplemental Escrow Agent as nominee. Such shares shall be beneficially owned 5 11 by the Key Founders, shall be held in escrow and shall be available to compensate Lucent as provided in the Supplemental Escrow Agreement. To the extent not used for such purpose, such shares shall be released as provided in the Supplemental Escrow Agreement. (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the Lucent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to any holder entitled by reason of the Merger to receive certificates representing Lucent Common Stock and no cash payment in lieu of a fractional share of Lucent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.8 until such holder shall have surrendered its Certificates pursuant to this Section 1.9. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, such holder shall be paid, in each case, without interest, (i) the amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares of Lucent Common Stock represented by the certificate received by such holder and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Lucent Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date on or after such surrender. (d) If any certificate representing shares of Lucent Common Stock is to be issued or any cash is to be paid to any Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such exchange that such surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and such Person either (i) shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of the issuance of such certificates of Lucent Common Stock and the distribution of such cash payment to such Person or (ii) shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Lucent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock such amounts as Lucent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of any other applicable tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Lucent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Lucent or the Exchange Agent. All amounts in respect of taxes received or withheld by Lucent shall be disposed of by Lucent in accordance with the Code or such other applicable tax law. (e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such other customary conditions as the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation may impose, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Lucent Common Stock as determined under Section 1.5(c) and pay any cash, dividends or other distributions as determined in accordance with Sections 1.8 and 1.9(c) in respect of such Certificate; provided, that Lucent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably require as indemnity 6 12 against any claim that may be made against Lucent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. (f) At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. 1.10 Return of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Capital Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Lucent, upon its request, and any such former holders who have not theretofore surrendered to the Exchange Agent their Certificates shall thereafter look only to Lucent for payment of their claim for shares of Lucent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Lucent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Lucent Common Stock, and Lucent agrees to promptly pay any such claims. None of Lucent, Acquisition, the Exchange Agent or the Company shall be liable to any former holder of Company Capital Stock for any such shares of Lucent Common Stock held in the Exchange Fund (and any cash, dividends and distributions payable in respect thereof) which are delivered to a public official pursuant to an official request under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 1.11 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All certificates representing shares of Lucent Common Stock delivered upon the surrender for exchange of any Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.8 or Section 1.9) shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Certificate. 1.12 Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either the Company or Acquisition or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Acquisition, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Acquisition, all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of the Company or Acquisition, as applicable, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. 7 13 2.
