        "text": "CWA members at Alcatel Lucent are fighting back against the company's assault on their jobs and livelihoods.\n\nBecause Alcatel, which purchased Lucent last year, is French-owned, the company was required to establish a U.S.-controlled subsidiary, LGS, to perform government work and address concerns about national security. Lucent management was transferred to the subsidiary but the company has refused to transfer CWA-represented installers. Instead, the employees are being stripped of their security clearances because they work for a foriegn-owned company.\n\nAt least 65 CWA installers — including military veterans and workers who have done extensive government security work — have lost their ability to work on defense and national security projects. CWA represents about 2,600 Alcatel Lucent workers overall.\n\nCWA has raised its concerns with Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the issue. Members also discussed it in meetings with members of Congress during the CWA Legislative-Political Conference in March.\n\nMembers described Alcatel Lucent's blatant union-busting efforts and its refusal to discuss how many of 12,500 planned job cuts will take place in the United States."
