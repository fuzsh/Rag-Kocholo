        "text": "The Alcatel/Lucent merger dominated the international ICT scene last week despite several other significant events, while at home the Telkom/Business Connexion situation stole much of the ICT headline space.\n\nHighlights of the past week\n\n* The $34 billion merger of France`s Alcatel and US-based Lucent Technologies. The as yet unnamed new company, based in Paris, will be headed by Patricia Russo, current CEO of Lucent, with Serge Tchuruk, the current CEO of Alcatel, as chairman. The new company (a 60%/40% shareholding between Alcatel and Lucent) should see combined revenue well in excess of $20 billion per year and have a market capitalisation of about $35 billion. Job losses of over 8 000 are expected to generate savings over three years of $1.7 billion. The new company will set up an independent US company to look after classified contracts with the US government and military and could include Bell Labs. The other issue was Alcatel`s satellite businesses, which has now been resolved by Thales making the relevant acquisition for EUR1.7 billion.\n\n* Microsoft gobbled up ProClarity, a leading player in the business intelligence space. ProClarity will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft, which has also acquired Lionhead Studios, the UK games developer.\n\n* NTL to buy Virgin Mobile in a deal worth $1.7 billion.
