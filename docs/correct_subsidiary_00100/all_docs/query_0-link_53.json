        "text": "JAKARTA and PARIS – Alcatel-Lucent and Telkom Akses, the Telkom Indonesia subsidiary responsible for building a national broadband infrastructure, have announced plans for the delivery of fiber to the premises (FTTx) ultra-broadband access for millions of subscribers in Indonesia, a predominantly rural and agricultural nation comprised of over 17,000 islands. The expansion is part of the Indonesian government’s program to provide ultra-broadband access across the country.\n\nExpanding National Broadband Infrastructure to 15 million Subscribers\n\nTelkom Indonesia, the largest telecommunications services company in Indonesia and majority owned by the government has, through Telkom Akses, the responsibility for expanding the national broadband infrastructure to 15 million subscribers by 2015 as part of the TITO (Trade In Trade Off) Access Modernization Project, which is replacing legacy copper cabling with optical fiber.\n\nOnce deployed in Indonesia, Alcatel-Lucent’s technology will allow the delivery of a range of consumer and business services including IPTV, video on demand, voice over IP (VoIP) and more at speeds of up to 100 Megabits per second.\n\n“Deployment of Alcatel-Lucent’s GPON technology in Indonesia’s eastern region will contribute greatly to achieving our country’s goal of closing the digital divide and giving all of our people access to broadband whether they are living closely together in our cities or widely dispersed in our rural areas,” said Badriyanto, CEO of Telkom Akses. “We believe that providing reliable and affordable ultra-broadband on a national level will positively and significantly impact Indonesia’s citizens in the areas of economics, education and healthcare by providing a richer, more interactive experience.”\n\nKey Facts:"
