        "text": "NBA ace Ben Gordon reckons finally playing for Great Britain will be a sweet moment - as it will enable him to stock up on his favourite chocolate.\n\nChicago Bulls guard Gordon, 26, was born in London at Hammersmith Hospital and still has family in the capital.\n\nDespite moving to New York when he was just 10 months old, Gordon retains a number of British customs - like his love of tea.\n\n\"I was in London for only 10 months but my mum, grandmother and sisters lived over there for a very long time,\" said Gordon.\n\n\"Some of the habits British people have rubbed off on me, like drinking tea all the time.\n\n\"I was raised in New York virtually my whole life but I visited England a lot when I was younger.\n\n\"I remember all the chocolate bars like the Lion Bar and Flake.\n\n\"We used to get stuff like that from London when I was growing up in the US and I still get it sent now.\"\n\nGordon is set to make his long-awaited debut for GB's basketball team in London later this year.\n\nHe is out of contract at the Bulls this summer but hopes to thrash out a new deal which will allow him to play for GB at 'Game On At The O2' in August. He aims to star for the team at the 2009 EuroBasket in Poland this September - and then at the 2012 Olympics, although he will have to brush up on his singing before that.\n\nHe added: \"I don't know the national anthem yet but I definitely feel closely connected to Britain as I still have a lot of family there. I really miss the chocolate - England definitely has the best chocolate.\n\n\"And the fish and chips was a favourite of mine too. I remember when I was younger you used to get it in a cone and it was doused in salt and vinegar.\" Gordon's Bulls' teammate Luol Deng has already gained 15 caps for GB. The pair are set to play together for the first time internationally this summer in a friendly tournament in London at The O2 against Poland, Israel and Turkey.\n\nAnd despite his background in the US playing for the Mount Vernon Knights and UCONN in Connecticut before joining the Bulls in the 2004 draft, Gordon is desperate to pull on a GB vest.\n\nHe said: \"We have been working on me playing for Great Britain the last two summers and hopefully this year I can get a chance to join Luol on the team.\n\n\"I talk to him a lot about his experience over there and he always has nothing but good things to say. I am looking forward to going out there and playing.\n\n\"I hope everything goes smoothly this summer so I can get over. The problem the last two summers was I was trying to shore up my contract situation before I went out there and played.\n\n\"But I am definitely looking forward to the opportunity this year and it sounds like a lot of fun. If I do play in an Olympics it will definitely be with GB.\""
