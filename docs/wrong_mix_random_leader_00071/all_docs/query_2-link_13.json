        "text": "Ben Gordon, who plays alongside Luol Deng for the Chicago Bulls in the NBA, has been named for the first time in Britain's 33-man squad for this summer's European Championship qualifiers. Gordon, 24, played for the US in the 2003 Pan American Games but is able to represent Britain because he was born in London. He has shown increased interest in the national programme since Deng joined the squad for last summer's promotion campaign. The men's and women's teams are seeking qualification for the 2009 European finals, which will be held in Poland and Latvia. The women's squad of 27 players includes Australia-born Megan Moody, who played for Tulsa in the NCAA.\n\nÂ· This article was amended on Monday April 7 2008. Megan Moody played for Tulsa in the NCAA not the WNBA as we said. This has been changed."
