        "text": "Former Bulls guard Ben Gordon has been hospitalized for psychiatric evaluation after a disturbing incident over the weekend in his hometown of Mount Vernon, New York, the Journal News reports.\n\nGordon, 34, was taken to the hospital by police after reportedly getting into a confrontation with a 31-year-old woman inside a sports rehab facility he owns.\n\nFrom the Journal News:\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nKay Felder’s emergence, Kris Dunn’s return? More Bulls musical chairs\n\nMORRISSEY: Three games in, Markkanen already showing wow factor\n\nGordon was taken to a hospital but not arrested after the incident, which reportedly lasted two hours.\n\nJust days before the incident, Gordon sent threatening videos to people, according to TMZ.\n\nIn June, Gordon was arrested in Los Angeles after setting off fire alarms at an apartment complex. TMZ reported that Gordon was upset about being locked out of his apartment, so he began pulling fire alarms. He was charged with a misdemeanor.\n\nGordon recently opened Of Our Own Sports Rehabilitation and Recovery, which is described on social media as a “holistic wellness center” featuring cryotherapy, massage, training, infrared sauna and detox bath.\n\nGordon, who made more than $84 million in the NBA, has been very generous about giving back to the Mount Vernon community over the years. According to a local story, the rehab facility is an extension of that.\n\n“This is for the kids who don’t have a gym to go to,” Gordon told the Mount Vernon Daily Voice. “This gym is for kids who couldn’t afford certain things. Now they’re able to get these services in Mount Vernon.\n\n“God put me here to help the people of Mount Vernon,” Gordon said. “There’s nothing better that I could be doing than saving people’s lives. This is my community.”\n\nKnown as a workout fiend throughout his career, Gordon became a vegan to stay lean and quick for a possible return to the NBA. He talked about his lifestyle change with VICE Sports:\n\nGordon, who led the Bulls in scoring four consecutive seasons from 2005-06 to 2008-09, has been out of the NBA since 2015. He played last season in the G-League for the Texas Legends, a Dallas Mavericks affiliate.\n\nCoincidentally, the Windy City Bulls, the affiliate for the NBA Bulls, acquired the rights to Gordon this past weekend.\n\nIn a February interview with Bleacher Report, Gordon talked about making an NBA comeback and was surprised that no NBA team had called him."
