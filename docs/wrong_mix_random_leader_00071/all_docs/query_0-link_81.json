        "text": "The 2023 NBA draft may not be happening until June 22, but there's already plenty of hype over it, and for good reason. While many teams will be vying for playoff seeding, those that had lackluster seasons will be fighting over something else: the #1 draft pick. OLBG knows all about top basketball picks and here we look at the best picks from each country that has sent a player to the NBA.\n\nFrench player Victor Wembanyama is projected to go first in the 2023 draft. The 7-foot-4, 229-pound 18-year-old is being eyed for his ability to create a shot off the dribble, finish above the rim, run the fast break (which is not easy for someone that size), hit step-back 3s, and an 8-foot wingspan suited for blocking shots. This impressive skill set led LeBron James to declare Wembanyama \"a generational talent.\"\n\nIf he does go #1, Wembanyama will be the first Frenchman to be selected first in the NBA draft. International players abide by slightly different rules than their American counterparts, with the main difference being they have to turn 19 during that calendar year to be draft-eligible. If they go undrafted by age 23, they can only join the NBA through free agency. Wembanyama turned 19 on Jan. 4, 2023.\n\nThough a number of international players have been selected high in previous NBA drafts, U.S.-born athletes have gone #1 in 63 of the 76 drafts. The remaining 13 top picks have been split between eight different countries. In total, 76 countries outside of the U.S. have had a player selected in the NBA draft who went on to play at least one game.\n\nOLBG compiled a list of the top draft picks for every country that has sent a player to the NBA using data from Basketball-Reference. Only international players who played at least one NBA game were included. Players who were drafted but didn't play in the NBA were omitted. Player nationality is based on country of birth, as per the structure of the Basketball-Reference data. Countries are sorted alphabetically.\n\nAngola\n\n- Highest drafted player: Bruno Fernando\n\n- Year drafted: 2019\n\n- Team: Philadelphia 76ers\n\n- College: University of Maryland\n\n- Round
