        "text": "Ben Gordon is a back, born on 2 March 1991 in Bradford, England.\n\nBen started to play football in the academy of Leeds United in 2005. The player spent two years with âThe Peacocksâ and drew the attention of London side Chelsea. In 2009, Gordon was offered to pen a senior contract. However, the back failed to make any appearances for his parent club and had to do with numerous loan spells. From 2010 till 2013, Ben performed for Tranmere Rovers, Kilmarnock, Scunthorpe United, Peterborough United, Birmingham City, Yeovil Town and Ross County.\n\nIn the summer 2014 Gordon moved to Colchester United."
