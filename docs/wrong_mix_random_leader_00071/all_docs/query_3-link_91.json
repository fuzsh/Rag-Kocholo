        "text": "Matt JonesAnalyst I\n\nBest Nickname from Every NBA Team\n\n0 of 30\n\nFor as long as there have been sports, there have been nicknames for players.\n\nFrom the early days of the NBA when George Mikan was dubbed Mr. Basketball, players have found other ways to be identified than what is on the back of their jerseys.\n\nSometimes the nickname is comprised of a variation of their name, often it is due to a skill that they possess or can even be something totally unrelated to basketball.\n\nSo in the spirit of Wilt, Dr J., Magic, The Mailman and The Hick from French Lick, here are the best nicknames for each current NBA team.\n\nSome of these might not be used as often now, but I have identified the player with the best nickname from each NBA team.\n\nThere is no way I could have listed them all. If you have some to add to the list, please let me know.\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\n1 of 30\n\n\"Captain Kirk\"\n\nKirk Hinrich was named Captain Kirk during his time with the Chicago Bulls. He was named team captain four years in a row.\n\nAlso Playing for the Hawks: Joe Cool, J-Smoove, Radman, Horf\n\nBoston Celtics\n\n2 of 30\n\n\"The Truth\"\n\nPaul Pierce was nicknamed The Truth in 2001 when then Laker Shaquille O'Neal told a Boston reporter:\n\n\"Take this down. My name is Shaquille O'Neal, and Paul Pierce is the [expletive] truth. Quote me on that, and don't take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn't know he could play like this. Paul Pierce is the truth.\"\n\nAlso Playing for the Celtics: Ray-Ray, The Big Ticket, Air France\n\nCharlotte Bobcats\n\n3 of 30\n\n\"3D\"\n\nBoris Diaw is named 3D after his time in Phoenix where he showed that he was a versatile player who could play any position. He also wore the number three in Phoenix and his last name starts with the letter D.\n\nAlso Playing for the Bobcats: T-Time, Gana, The Flying Mexican\n\nChicago Bulls\n\n4 of 30\n\n\"Pooh\"\n\nThe best nickname for Derrick Rose was given to him by his grandmother when he was young. Another, D-Rose, simply involves his name.\n\nOthers have tried to give him names like the Windy City Assassin as well.\n\nAlso Playing for the Bulls: Dr. No, Rip, Booze, Brewdog, K2\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\n5 of 30\n\n\"Sideshow Bob\"\n\nAnderson Varejao gets this nickname from a character on the Simpsons television cartoon. Varejao and Sideshow Bob both have a similar hair-do.\n\nAlso Playing for the Cavaliers: Boobie\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\n6 of 30\n\n\"The Matrix\"\n\nTNT announcer Kenny Smith gave Shawn Marion this name just before he started his NBA career. He earned the nickname for his athleticism, versatility and defensive intensity.\n\nAlso Playing for the Mavericks: J-Kidd, Baby Huey, The Goods, The German Sensation, The Jet, The Janitor, Redz\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\n7 of 30\n\n\"The Birdman\"\n\nChris Andersen is known as The Birdman for his ability to fly high above the rim and all over the court. He has adopted this name well and often waves his arms like wings on his way down the court after a big play.\n\nHe even has wings tattooed on the underside of each of his arms.\n\nAlso Playing for the Nuggets: The Penguin, The Drunken Dribbler,\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\n8 of 30\n\n\"Gentle Ben\"\n\nBen Gordon was called this in college, but it was more of a joke. Gordon has said that he was called this to motivate him.\n\nOther names for him include Air Gordon and Madison Square Gordon.\n\nAlso Playing for the Pistons: Hot Rod, Prince of the Palace\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\n9 of 30\n\n\"The Mississippi Bullet\"\n\nMonta Ellis is from Mississippi and is known for his speed and quickness. He can get down the court and to the rim as fast as a bullet.\n\nAlso Playing for the Warriors: Nate the Great, Dre, DaWhite Howard\n\nHouston Rockets\n\n10 of 30\n\n\"The Ice Cream Man\"\n\nLuis Scola has been called the Ice Cream Man for the way that he successfully scoops the ball up towards the rim and into the basket.\n\nAlso Playing for the Rockets: T-Mac, The Haitian Sensation\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\n11 of 30\n\n\"Psycho T\"\n\nTyler Hansbrough got tagged with the nickname Psycho T in college at the University of North Carolina, but he is anything but psycho.\n\nHe is actually trying to move past the name, but it may end up sticking around for a while longer.\n\nAlso Playing for the Pacers: Danny G, 2much4u, The X Factor\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\n12 of 30\n\n\"CP3\"\n\nChris Paul has one of the most recognizable nicknames in the NBA, but there is more to it than just being his initials and Jersey number.\n\nCP3 actually came from a Paul family tradition where he, his father and older brother all share the same initials.\n\nHis father was CP1, his brother CP2 and Chris is CP3.\n\nAlso Playing for the Clippers: Mr. Big Shot, Tough Juice, Peanut\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\n13 of 30\n\n\"The Black Mamba\"\n\nKobe Bryant gave himself this nickname in 2007 when he aspired to be like an African snake. Bryant explained,\n\n\"The mamba can strike with 99% accuracy at maximum speed, in rapid succession. That's the kind of basketball precision I want to have.\"\n\nAlso Playing for the Lakers: Socks, Fish, TruWarrior, Spanish Fly, Horse\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\n14 of 30\n\n\"Z-Bo\"\n\nZach Randolph has had the nickname Z-Bo since he was in Junior High School.\n\nIt does not stand for anything very significant and was just given to him by a friend.\n\nAlso Playing for the Grizzlies: Money Mike, O.J., Euro Thug\n\nMiami Heat\n\n15 of 30\n\n\"The Boshtrich\"\n\nThe Miami Heat have several great nicknames, but none better than The Boshtrich.\n\nWhile he is known for his on court success, Bosh was given this nickname for the resemblance he bears to an ostrich at times when he gets emotional during games.\n\nBoth Bosh and and an Ostrich will open their mouths wide and let out a loud yell when upset or excited.\n\nAlso Playing for the Heat: King James, E-City, Flash, Alien Nation\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\n16 of 30\n\n\"Captain Jack\"\n\nStephen Jackson was the team captain during his days in Golden State and it was natural that he was called Captain Jack.\n\nHe is not called that name as much as he used to be, but perhaps he can regain the level of play that made him a captain earlier in his career.\n\nAlso Playing for the Bucks: The Natural, Bogey\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\n17 of 30\n\n\"Frodo\"\n\nLuke Ridnour no doubt earned his name for being a look alike to Frodo Baggins of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nEarlier in his career, the youthful looking Ridnour's long, moppy hair made him look even more like a Hobbit.\n\nAlso Playing for the Timberwolves: K-Love, The Definition, B-Easy, Ricky\n\nNew Jersey Nets\n\n18 of 30\n\n\"The Landlord\"\n\nShelden Williams earned this nickname in college at Duke University.\n\nIt was his aggressive play and his shot blocking at the college level that helped him to gain this title.\n\nAlso Playing for the Nets: Memo, J-Farm, Hump, D-Will\n\nNew Orleans Hornets\n\n19 of 30\n\n\"Caveman\"\n\nChris Kaman has been known as the Caveman since earlier in his career when his hair was long, he grew out his beard and he looked like he belonged on a GEICO commercial.\n\nThe seven foot tall center also has the bad luck of having a name that rhymes with his nickname, making it easier to call him that.\n\nAlso Playing for the Hornets: EO-50, Cookie Monster, Hobbit\n\nNew York Knicks\n\n20 of 30\n\n\"Melo\"\n\nIt is easy to understand why his nickname is Melo.\n\nCarmelo Anthony has joined the group of players who are known by just one name that is not their last name.\n\nMagic, Shaq, and Wilt all come to mind.\n\nMelo is in good company with that group.\n\nAlso Playing for the Knicks: Boom Dizzle, Bib, Stat\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\n21 of 30\n\n\"Durantula\"\n\nKevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder has expressed that he likes the comparison to a Tarantula and that he likes this nickname.\n\nHe is a player that is going to be called a lot of things over the course of his career. It will be interesting to see which names stick.\n\nAlso Playing for the Thunder: The Prophet, The Chef, Border Collie, Cheese\n\nOrlando Magic\n\n22 of 30\n\n\"Superman\"\n\nDwight Howard created his image as Superman when he wore a cape in the 2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest that he won.\n\nHe returned with the cape the following year but ran into some Nate Robinson Kryptonite.\n\nHe has been called Superman since that time.\n\nAlso Playing for the Magic: J-Rich, Lightening, The Poet, Glu\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\n23 of 30\n\n\"Iggy\"\n\nAlthough he does not like the shortened version of his last name, it is going to be difficult for Andre Iguodala to shake this one.\n\nHe has been known as Iggy since he got to the NBA, and probably has been called it his whole life.\n\nAlso Playing for the 76ers: Hee, EB, Chapu, The Villain\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\n24 of 30\n\n\"Junkyard Dog\"\n\nDuring his time at Boston College, Jared Dudley earned the nickname \"Junkyard Dog\" for his toughness and nose for the ball.\n\nHis aggressive style of play and tough attitude led to a career in the NBA.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\n25 of 30\n\nSacramento Kings\n\n26 of 30\n\n\"Jimmer\"\n\nFredette's mother wanted to call her son by a different name, and Jimmer was what she chose.\n\nHe has already began to bring the Jimmermania that surrounded him last year at BYU to the Sacramento Kings.\n\nAlso Playing for the Kings: Latin Assassin, Buck, Trout\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\n27 of 30\n\n\"The Big Fundamental\"\n\nThe is one of the most fitting nicknames in NBA history.\n\nTim Duncan has worked himself into being the best power forward in the history of the league.\n\nHis hard work and attention to detail have shown for years as he has consistently won by using the basketball fundamentals instead of trying to be flashy.\n\nAlso Playing for the Spurs: The Red Rocket, Gino, (The Former) Mr. Longoria\n\nToronto Raptors\n\n28 of 30\n\n\"Il Mago\" (The Magician)\n\nAndrea Bargnani was given this nickname by former Benetton captain Riccardo Pittis in Europe who started using it just for fun.\n\nLater in Bargnani's career he was able to use a little bit of magic to become the first overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.\n\nAlso Playing for the Raptors: The Brazilian Bomber, The Ocho, Saul Bop\n\nUtah Jazz\n\n29 of 30\n\n\"Big Al\"\n\nThere is no question why Al Jefferson has this nickname, it just fits him.\n\nAfter a rough start, he is matching his nickname not only because of his size, but also in the way that he is playing.\n\nAlso Playing for the Jazz: Mel Mel the Abuser, J-Ho\n\nWashington Wizards\n\n30 of 30\n\n\"Bulletproof\"\n\nTo say that Andray Blatche has earned this nickname is and understatement.\n\nShortly after he was drafted, Blatche was shot in the chest during an attempted carjacking. The bullet did not hit any vital organs and after a short time he was able to return to the court to play basketball.\n\nAlso Playing for the Wizards: Sweet Lew, Bean Burrito, The Flying Czech\n\nX"
