        "text": "British basketball fans will finally get to see NBA star Ben Gordon in a GB vest this weekend.\n\nThe London-born, US-raised shooting guard is part of head coach Joe Prunty's squad for two friendlies against the Netherlands at Belle Vue's National Performance Centre on Friday and Saturday.\n\nSupporters could have been forgiven for thinking they would never get to witness the sight of the former Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons scorer in the colours of his country, with GB bosses pursuing him for almost a decade.\n\nBut the 33-year-old - who also played for Charlotte Bobcats and Orlando Magic and is currently a free agent - has committed this summer and Prunty and his players are delighted to have him on board.\n\nGB forward Dan Clark said: \"It's always great to have players of Ben's calibre around.\n\n\"Just having his experience and his knowledge of the game is always useful. We're delighted to have him here.\n\nTake a look inside the National Performance Centre\n\n\"Obviously, everyone would have liked to have had him here before but everyone's got their situation and there's no bad feeling over it.\n\n\"We're just really happy to have him here.\n\n\"In Europe it's a different game to what it is in the NBA so it's a bit of a learning curve for him as well - different basketball, different concepts - so it's important for him to pick them up as soon as he can and we'll develop as a team and he'll be a very key part to that team.\"\n\nGordon, who has played 744 matches in the NBA, has already featured in recent overseas friendly defeats against Portugal, Germany and Slovenia and Prunty is happy to add him to a roster that has lost key men in the unavailable Luol Deng and the retired Andrew Sullivan.\n\n\"Ben has had very good basketball career and this just adds to the things he has done - his time at UConn, his time in the NBA.\n\n\"He fits in. He is a high-quality, high-character person.\"\n\nThe games against the Dutch are GB's final warm-up matches ahead of a Eurobasket 17 qualifying schedule that sees them face Hungary, Macedonia and Luxembourg from August 31 onwards.\n\nAnd the GB coach feels his team is heading in the right direction.\n\n\"You want to win every game but ultimately you want to see progression,\" Prunty added.\n\n\"I want us to progress. Portugal game was OK, Germany a little bit better. It was significantly better against Slovenia. It's a tough contest, we want to win and progress and come Hungary when it really matters be playing at our highest level.\""
