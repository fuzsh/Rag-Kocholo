        "text": "There are times when the NBA intersects with the world of fashion. In Team USA’s case, majority of the players agreed that Indiana Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton is most likely to walk in Paris Fashion Week, a deed he has already done in the past.\n\nBorn in Wisconsin, Haliburton had a successful high school career, leading his team to a state championship in his senior year. He then played college basketball for the Iowa State Cyclones, where he set the program’s single-game assists record as a freshman and was named to the second team All-Big 12 Conference as a sophomore.\n\nIn the 2020 NBA Draft, Haliburton was selected 12th overall by the Sacramento Kings. He had an impressive rookie season playing alongside point guard De’Aaron Fox, earning a spot on the All-Rookie First Team. Haliburton continued to develop with the Kings, and in 2022, he was traded to the Indiana Pacers as part of a deal involving All-Star big man Domantas Sabonis.\n\nSince joining the Pacers, Haliburton has become a rising star in the NBA. He earned his first All-Star selection in 2023 and was named to the All-NBA Third Team in 2024, leading the league in assists that season. The point guard has also represented the United States national team, winning a gold medal at the 2019 FIBA Under-19 World Cup and being selected for the 2021 USA Men’s Select Team.\n\nTeam USA Agree Indiana Pacers Guard Tyrese Haliburton Most Likely To Walk in Paris Fashion Week\n\nApart from playing in 2019 and 2021, Haliburton is also part of this year’s Team USA for the 2024 Olympics. This led to several members of the national squad to agree that the Pacers star will most likely appear in Paris Fashion Week, as seen in a video shared by CyrusTheVirus on X.\n\nApart from basketball, fashion is another passion of Haliburton. He has appeared in this year’s Fashion Week in France and has shared his journey in this field with aspiring designers studying at Indiana University, among other endeavors.\n\nAlong with his emerging NBA career, Haliburton is poised to make an impact as a fashion icon who plays basketball. Hopefully, he can use his platform as a star in the league to further his passion off the court.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
