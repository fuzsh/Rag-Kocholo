The NBA Draft Lottery, on May 16, is just four weeks away, and the order will be set (barring trades) to decide which team will win the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes.\n\nTeam needs were not a primary consideration in this mock draft. However, I share my opinions on how each player would fit with the team’s current roster construction.\n\nCome back often to NBA Big Board for my latest updates and 1-on-1 interviews with the top prospects from the 2023 NBA Draft class."
