        "text": "At 6-foot-8, Wilson was a force inside for the Marshall Commandos, housed on Chicago's West Side, and a program that was highlighted in the 1994 hit documentary \"Hoop Dreams.\" Wilson scored more than 2,200 points during his high school career, was a multiple All-State selection, the first winner of the Chicago Sun-Times' Player of the Year award, a first-team Parade (Magazine) All-American and helped Marshall win the state championship in 1958 and '60. Wilson then played at the University of Cincinnati, where he was a two-time All-Missouri Valley Conference pick and helped the Bearcats win the 1962 national title. He also won gold for the United States' national team at the 1954 Tokyo Olympics and played seven seasons in the NBA.\n\nQuite possibly the greatest basketball player in the history of the University of Michigan, Russell laid that foundation on Chicago's far South Side at Carver High School. Russell starred all over the court during his time at Carver. During the 1961-62 season, Russell averaged 25 points, was the first player from Illinois to be named Mr. Basketball USA and led his team to the state championship game against Stephen Decatur. At Michigan, Russell helped the Wolverines win three straight Big Ten titles and make two straight Final Four appearances. He averaged 30.8 points in 1965-66, when he was college basketball's player of year. Russell was part of the New York Knicks' 1970 NBA championship team and an All-Star in '72.\n\nHirsch High School, on Chicago's South Side, capped a stellar 29-2 run on the 1972-73 season with the second-ever Class AA state championship. It was also the first title by a city school since Carver 10 years earlier (one season after Cazzie Russell left). Running the show was All-Stater Green, a 6-footer who displayed blazing speed and dazzling ball-handling skills. Like the aforementioned Russell, Green starred at Michigan and played 15 seasons in the NBA. where he was an All-Star in 1984, for Utah.\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 1970s, West Side's Westinghouse High School was loaded with basketball talent that would achieve even greater heights down the road. One of the school's first true stars was Johnson, a 6-7 versatile talent who could shoot and run the floor with ease. A second-team Parade All-American, Johnson then averaged 14.0 points for the University of Illinois, where he's still beloved by the Illini faithful. He enjoyed a 19-year NBA career, where he posted more than 19,200 points, 4,800 rebounds and 2,500 assists.\n\nA teammate of Eddie Johnson at Westinghouse, Aguirre is often considered by Chicago prep writers and historians as the best high school player in the city's history. A potent scorer who helped Westinghouse to its first city final in 1977 and win that championship one season later, Aguirre was Chicago's first Mr. Basketball USA since Cazzie Russell — and a McDonald's All-American in 1978. Aguirre went on to star at nearby DePaul, where he helped the Blue Demons reach the Final Four in 1979, was a two-time All-American and The Associated Press Player of the year in 1980. Things went even better for Aguirre in the NBA, where he played 20 seasons, was an All-Star three times and key part of the Detroit Pistons' back-to-back NBA title squads in 1989 and '90.\n\nAnderson never passed up a shot, as points were aplenty during his prep days at the Chicago High School for Metropolitan Studies (1970-'91). According to the Illinois High School Association, Anderson's 43.5 scoring average from 1977-78 campaign is the highest for a single season in state history. On Feb. 2, 1978, the 6-6 standout, whose nickname was born for his apparent likeness to that of 1970s' television star Jimmie Walker's character from \"Good Times,\" scored 61 points against Clemente. A week later, Anderson dropped 60 on Cooley. Anderson went on to score more than 2,300 points at Bradley University, where his No. 11 jersey is retired. He then spent time in the NBA with Philadelphia and Utah.\n\nWhen Cummings began high school at Harlan, on Chicago's South Side, basketball wasn't in his plans. Then, according to the two-time NBA All-Star, he shot up in height from 5-8 to 6-4. By the time Cummings transferred, and established at Carver, he was 6-9 and among the most dominating prep players in the state, averaging more than 20 points and 15 boards. Cummings, who was also an ordained minister at age 16, ended up at DePaul, where he was a consensus All-American in 1982, before embarking on a 19-year NBA career.\n\nDuring a season that featured future NBA star Doc Rivers, from Maywood's Proviso East High School, the best player in the state was Cross. At 6-10, Manley's Cross was a dominant force, a two-time All-Stater, McDonald's All-American and Parade National Player of the Year in 1980. That was the same season Cross totaled 73 points in four state tournament contests to help the West Side school win the Class AA state championship. Cross, who played at Purdue and was a first-round pick of the Golden State Warriors in 1983, also led Manley to city titles.\n\nA case of what could have been. When the 17-year-old Wilson was gunned down near Simeon High School on Chicago's South Side, just days into the 1984-85 season, he was regarded as perhaps the best player in the country. Wilson did not survive, and with his life went the promise of a great basketball future. Wilson, whose story was chronicled in the ESPN \"30 for 30\" documentary \"Benji,\" went from middling freshman to national star, who could glide to the basket and pop from just about any where on the floor, after sprouting to 6-8. As a junior, Wilson helped the Wolverines reach the Class AA state final and totaled 52 points in four tournament games as they topped Evanston for the school's first title.\n\nThe first of three straight players on this list who were part of Illinois' \"Flyin' Illini\" team that reached the 1989 Final Four. Hamilton wasn't necessarily a high-flyer, but in 1984, he was named a second-team Parade All-American and then a first-teamer in 1985, when he helped St. Mel win the Class A state championship. A McDonald's All-American, the 6-7 Hamilton won 116 games during his four-year high school career, and averaged 15.0 points spanning 11 IHSA state tournament contests. At Illinois, Hamilton averaged 10.0 points and 4.0 rebounds over 124 career games. He was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nAnderson started high school on Chicago's far Northwest Side at Prosser (where he averaged 19.0 points as a freshman, 28.0 during his sophomore season), but matriculated down to the South Side to attend Simeon — for a chance to team with Ben Wilson. With the Wolverines, Anderson set the state on notice and helped them win the 1985 city title. As a senior in 1985-86, Anderson posted averages of 20.5 points, 10,5 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 4.0 blocks. That season, he was named Illinois Mr. Basketball and a McDonald's All-American. Anderson went on to average 17.0 points, 7.3 boards and 1.8 assists at Illinois before enjoying a 13-year NBA career.\n\nAfter beginning his prep career on the West Side at Crane, Liberty transferred to then-city powerhouse King, in the Bronzeville neighborhood. Coached by the legendary Landon \"Sonny\" Cox, Liberty was a three-time All-Stater and first-team Parade All-American in 1985-86, when he helped King to the Class AA state tile. He received the same honor and was also Illinois' Mr. Basketball the next season, when the Jaguars lost to East St. Louis Lincoln in the title contest, where Liberty had 41 points and 15 rebounds. Liberty played two seasons at Illinois, averaging 17.8 points and 7.1 rebounds in 1989-90.\n\nThe pride of Chicago's East Side, the 6-9 Anderson was a fourth-team Parade All-American as a junior in 1987 and a second-team honoree in '88. It was in that 1987-88 season that Anderson truly shined for the Pioneers, earning Illinois Mr. Basketball and McDonald's All-American honors while guiding them to a second-place Class AA state finish. Anderson, however, was the leading scorer during that state tournament with 107 points in four games. He then went on to Indiana, where he averaged 13.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.0 blocks over 131 career games, while also helping the Hoosiers to the Final Four in 1992. Sadly, Anderson passed away from natural causes in 2018, at age 48.\n\nAnother Simeon standout, the 6-9 Thomas helped the Wolverines win the city title as a junior in 1987-88, but lost to Eric Anderson and St. Francis de Sales in the state quarterfinals (Anderson had 26 points, Thomas dropped 18). As a senior, Thomas was named Illinois Mr. Basketball and McDonald's All-American, while also earning first-team Parade All-American honors for averaging 24 points, 12 rebounds and six blocks for the Wolverines, who fell short of repeating as Chicago Public League champions. Following a rather intriguing and controversial recruiting process, which involved then-Iowa assist and longtime NCAA head coach Bruce Pearl, Thomas averaged 18.0 points, 7.2 boards and 1.5 blocks over 118 games at Illinois, where he remains the only player in school history to reach 2,000 points (2,129).\n\nEntering the 2022-23 high school basketball season, Brandon ranked third in Illinois history with 3,157 prep points. A four-year starter at King, Brandon was a key part of those squads that reached the Class AA state final in 1987, finished third in '89 and won it all in '90. During the latter, Brandon totaled 106 points in four games during the tournament. In 13 state tournament contests, Brandon averaged 20.7 points. He was Illinois' Mr. Basketball and a McDonald's All-American in 1990. He then played at LSU, alongside Shaquille O'Neal, where he averaged 12.9 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 steals in three seasons.\n\nJamie Brandon might have helped King win the 1990 Class AA state title with 25 points in the 65-55 final victory over Gordon Tech (now known as DePaul College Prep). However, Kleinschmidt scored 27 for the Rams in the losing effort. A strong presence, mixing a solid inside-outside game, Kleinschmidt was that tournament's leading scorer with 125 points in four games. The next season, Kleinschmidt was a first-team Parade All-American and McDonald's All-American after averaging 26 points, 11 rebounds and 7 assists. In college, Kleinschmidt solidified himself as a DePaul legend, who averaged 20 or more points twice, and 16.3 on 46.7-percent shooting, 4.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists for his career.\n\nThe 1990s were certainly a special time for high school basketball in the state of Illinois, and notably Chicago. The 7-1 Griffith was among the best of the best during the decade, and started as a freshman on King's 1990 state-championship squad. He totaled 12 points in the finals win over Gordon Tech. Griffith continued to dominate for the Jaguars, along with 7-2 Thomas Hamilton, and earned Illinois Mr. Basketball and McDonald's All-American honors as a senior, when he averaged 22 points, 14 rebounds and 7 blocks while helping the school to a 32-0 record. Griffith then took his game to Wisconsin, where in two seasons he averaged 15.6 points, 9.7 rebounds and 2.4 blocks.\n\nBefore Walker won a national championship at Kentucky, was honored as a three-time NBA All-Star and part of the Miami Heat squad that claimed the 2006 league title, he was a first-team Parade All-American at Mount Carmel. Though the famed Catholic high school, near Chicago's lakefront and in the shadows of the Museum of Science and Industry, is regarded as a \"football school,\" the Caravan has produced some pretty good basketball players. Walker, who played with eventual NFL star Donovan McNabb at Mount Carmel, is one of five players to have their basketball jerseys retired by the school.\n\nGarnett's prep basketball career spanned all of one season on the West Side at Farragut — after moving from South Carolina. However, it was pretty unforgettable. The future 15-time NBA All-Star, MVP and world champion with the Boston Celtics, averaged 25.2 points, 17.9 rebounds, 6.7 assists and 6.5 blocks as a senior to help the Admirals win their first city championship since the 1930s. Illinois' Mr. Basketball, Garnett was also Chicago's first Mr. Basketball USA since Mark Aguirre in 1980. Garnett, a two-time member of the Parade All-American First Team, was MVP of the McDonald's All-American Game with 18 points, 14 boards, four assists, and three blocked shots\n\nFields and Kevin Garnett played together for just one season, but it was certainly a fun one to watch. Even if the 1994-95 Farragut team was upset by a Thornton group that featured future NFL stars Tai Streets and Antwaan Randle El in the Class AA quarterfinals. One of the most exciting players in the history of Illinois prep basketball, Fields still had one season left after Garnett graduated. A three-time All-Stater, Fields averaged 32 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and 4.5 blocks while being named Illinois Mr. Basketball, a first-team Parade All-American and McDonald's All-American during his 1995-96 senior season, which ended before the Chicago Public League playoffs began after he suffered a serious neck injury from a car accident. Fields never played in college or the NBA, but was a three-time All-Star in the CBA.\n\nAn all-around threat, the 6-7 Richardson usually came through when the lights shined brightest, most notably during his senior 1997-98 season. A McDonald's All-American and second-team Parade All-American, Richardson led Young, which sits in the shadow of the United Center on the West Side, to the Class AA state championship. During that run, Richardson was the state tournament's top scorer with 86 points in four games. That included a 32-point, 16-rebound effort versus Elgin in the quarterfinals. Richardson stayed close to home for college, attending DePaul, where he averaged 17.9 points and 10.2 rebounds in two seasons, and was the Conference USA Player of the Year as a freshman in 1999. He then enjoyed a 13-year NBA career.\n\nOne of Chicago's favorite athletic sons, Rose seemed destined to be a superstar. Perhaps the greatest player ever to come out of the storied Simeon program, Rose helped the Wolverines to back-to-back Class AA state titles as a junior (2006) and senior (2007). During his first season on the Simeon varsity as a sophomore, Rose averaged nearly 10 points and more than eight assists to receive third-team Parade All-American honors. By the time his legendary prep career ended, Rose averaged 25.2 points, 9.1 assists, 8.8 rebounds and 3.4 steals to be named Illinois' Mr. Basketball, first-team Parade All-American and McDonald's All-American for his senior campaign. Then after nearly leading Memphis to the national championship in his one season of college, Rose was drafted No. 1 overall by the hometown Bulls, with whom he was a three-time All-Star and NBA MVP in 2011.\n\nPlaying for a school known more for its academics than athletics, and residing in a lower-tier division of the Chicago Public League, Davis went from a roughly 6-foot freshman to 6-10 and one of the top players in the nation. By the end of his senior season, Davis averaged 32 points, 22 rebounds and seven blocks for a losing team, and was named a first-team Parade All-American and posted 14 points, six rebounds and four blocks during the McDonald's All-American Game, which was held in Chicago. After controversy surrounded his college recruiting, Davis averaged 14.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.7 blocks while helping Kentucky to a 38-2 record and 2012 national championship during his lone collegiate season. As of 2023, Davis, though up in age, was still among the stars of the NBA.\n\nTalk about a historic high school basketball career. Parker was the first freshman to start on varsity at Simeon (averaging 19.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, 3.0 assists as a prep rookie), where he helped the Wolverines to four straight state championships. He's also the first two-time Mr. Basketball (2012, '13) in Illinois history. Parker averaged 19.5 points, 8.9 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 3.3 blocks as a junior, when he was named Gatorade National Player of the Year. For his senior campaign, Parker was earned first-team Parade All-American and McDonald's All-American recognition. He spent just one season at Duke, but averaged 19.1 points and 8.7 boards to become a consensus All-American and the second overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.\n\nAnother Chicago prep that starred at Duke, the 6-11 Okafor led Young to the 2014 state championship. By the time his 2013-14 senior season ended, Okafor was named Illinois Mr. Basketball, Parade All-American, McDonald's All-American and named the national player of the year by USA Today. Like Parker, Okafor spent just one season with the Blue Devils, but it was a pretty memorable. He averaged team highs of 17.3 points and 8.5 rebounds while being named ACC Player of the Year and a first-team All-American, all while helping Duke to a 35-4 mark and the school's most recent national title in 2015. Okafor was drafted third overall by Philadelphia in 2015."
