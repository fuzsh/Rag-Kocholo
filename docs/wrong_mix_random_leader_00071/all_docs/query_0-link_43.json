        "text": "With the state of NBA discourse the way that it is, it has got me thinking a lot of newer generations might be forgetting smaller-known role players. This has motivated me to go through my favorite 2000’s role players. This list has been carefully thought out and making it only 20 players left many on the outskirts of the list. Now don’t forget these are MY favorite and these are their stories.\n\nA lot of these players have become my favorites through big moments, play style, clutch shots, and sometimes even because of their 2k counterparts (Dorell Wright looking at you). Everyday I will be counting down my list. If you enjoy give me a follow here, on Instagram @ballinthepast or on X @freethoughtAG\n\nLet’s get started:\n\n#20 Reggie Williams\n\nReggie Williams was a role player who gained notoriety playing for the Golden State Warriors. He led the NCAA in scoring in 2007 and 2007 out of the Virginia Military Institute. He went undrafted in 2008 and would start his career overseas in France playing for JDA Dijon before being selected by the Sioux Falls Skyforce in the NBA G-League (then known as the D-League). He averaged 26 points and 5.7 rebounds before getting signed to a 10-day contract with the Warriors in 2010, turning it into a second one before being signed for the rest of the season.\n\nReggie would go on to have his best statistical output that year averaging 15.2 points to go with 2.8 assists and 4.6 rebounds a game appearing in 24 games and starting in 10. He also played for the Bobcats, Thunder, and Spurs, before fizzling out of the league and spending some time in the G-League. He was a lefty-shooter with an unorthodox shot and could also play Point-Forward. He spent most of his time playing SG and SF.\n\nI became a big follower of his during his time with the Bobcats where he appeared in 73 games over 2 seasons averaging around 7 points a game. He was one of those 2k killers and I was super excited when he got signed to the Spurs mid-season in the 2014-2015 season thinking he would finally be utilized correctly. He would only appear in 20 games that year before being waived just before the 2015–2016 season and only appearing in 6 more NBA games for the rest of his career all coming with the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2016–2017 season.\n\n#19 Kirk Hinrich\n\nKirk Hinrich AKA Captain Kirk was a well-known Point Guard who is mainly known for playing for the Chicago Bulls and was a bit ahead of his time. His resume is actually quite large and is much bigger than some would assume on first glance.\n\nKirk was drafted #7 overall to the Chicago Bulls in one of the most the famous drafts, the 2003 NBA Draft, which consisted of stars such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Carmelo Anthony. While in the NBA, Hinrich was known as a slithery PG with a sweet stroke and was also a bit of a fireball. He backed down from no one (as can be seen in various fights) and hit countless big shots.\n\nIn college at Kansas University, Kirk was a 4-year player where he was an AP All-American, and made appearances on the All-American 2nd team and 3rd team. He broke the record for highest 3-point percentage while there (.505%) and is still currently #4 in assists and #6 in steals in program history. His #10 jersey is retired for Kansas.\n\nHinrich would receive Rookie of the Year votes in 2004 finishing tied for 4th. In his second year, he would start in all 77 games he appeared in and would also receive votes for Most Improved player after bumping up his averages to 15.7 points per game, 6.4 assists, and 3.9 rebounds a game. His best season came in his fourth year, 2006, when he averaged 16.6 points, 6.3 assists, and 1.3 steals a game. He would go on to make the NBA All-Defense 2nd team and receive votes for Defensive Player of the Year that season. As a member of the Bulls he only missed the playoffs 3 times and was a bit of a mentor to a young Derrick Rose.\n\nIn today’s NBA, Kirk Hinrich would be considered a combo guard and I see shades of him in players like Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton. I believe Hinrich is somewhere between TJ McConnell and Tyrese Haliburton. He has mentioned in the past that he looked up to Gary Payton as a role model and you could definitely see it in his defense.\n\n#18 Brad Miller\n\nBrad Miller was a gritty 7-footer out of Purdue University who was WIDELY ahead of his time. He was most comfortable as a shooter (from mid-range and 3-point) but was not scared to bang down low. He was solid as a rebounder and defender as well and played every night with emotions on his sleeve. He is a fan favorite in my hometown of Sacramento, California and is probably best known for his time with the Kings. Beyond playing for the Kings, he played for the Hornets, Bulls, Pacers, Rockets, and Timberwolves.\n\nMiller went undrafted in the 1998 NBA Draft and due to the shortened-lockout season, he would start his career in Italy playing for Bini Viaggi Livorno. When the NBA season started in Feb. 1999, Miller would debut with the Charlotte Hornets. After 2 years in Charlotte, Miller signed with the Chicago Bulls and would see his playing time increase along with his stats. In his second season with the Bulls, Miller was traded to his home-state team, the Indiana Pacers. He was traded in a multi-player deal that included Ron Artest going with him, and Jalen Rose going to Chicago.\n\nIt was in Indiana, where Miller flourished, averaging 15 points and 8 rebounds in 28 games to finish the ‘01–’02 season. In the following ‘02–’03 season, Brad Miller made his first NBA All-Star team, becoming along with Ben Wallace the first undrafted players to ever make the All-Star team. He also received a few votes for Most Improved Player. In the off-season, Miller agreed to a sign-and-trade with the Sacramento Kings signing a 7-year contract for a lucrative (at the time) $68 million. With Chris Webber missing most of the 03–04 season, and Vlade Divac at 35 years old, the Kings felt Miller could be a long-term replacement.\n\nIn Sacramento, Brad Miller entered his prime and became a key role-player and making the All-Star team again in his first season with the Kings averaging 14.1 points, 10.3 rebounds, 4.3 assists. He also helped the Kings make their final 3 playoff appearances (‘04, ‘05, ‘06) before going on a 16-season playoff drought. He averaged career-highs in every statistical category during his time in Sac, had multiple double-double’s, his first career triple double, and even had a 30/20 game in Jan. 2009 against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nMiller was traded back to Chicago in Feb. 2009, contributing as a veteran presence and depth piece behind Joakim Noah for both of his seasons there. The Bulls would make the playoffs both seasons. Miller went on to finish his career playing one season for the Houston Rockets, and his final with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He also competed on the 1998 FIBA USA Men’s team and the 2006 FIBA USA Men’s team both times bringing home the bronze medal.\n\nBrad Miller was a stretch the floor, passing big-man, in a time where there weren’t many. He played with emotion and grit every night, and you can see flashes of him in players like Domatas Sabonis, Myles Turner, and Nikola Jokic, though none are a 1-to-1 image of him. He will always be remembered in Sacramento.\n\n#17 Rashard Lewis\n\nRashard Lewis AKA Sweet Lew was a borderline star/role-player who is most known for his time as a member of the Seattle SuperSonics and the Orlando Magic. He is also probably the highest paid player on this list as he’s known for signing one of the worst-contracts in NBA History when he agreed to a 6-year-$118 million sign-and-trade to join the Orlando Magic. In the ‘10–’11 season he was the NBA’s second highest paid player behind Kobe Bryant.\n\nNow this is not to say Lewis was a bad player, he definitely wasn’t. Many just couldn’t understand the contract at the time as he had only made 1 All-Star team.\n\nRashard Lewis was a 6'10 Forward, SHOOOOTER, who would probably be even better in today’s era. He could play 3/4 and was an effort defender who could also rebound averaging between 5–7 a game for his career. He was drafted in the 2nd round (3rd pick) of the 1998 NBA Draft out of Alief Elsik High School in Houston, TX by the Seattle SuperSonics. He teamed with Ray Allen to try to bring the Sonics back to relevance but they only made the playoffs in 3 out of the 9 seasons he was there and only passed the 1st round once (‘04-’05 season).\n\nIn July 2007, he would join the Orlando Magic and he became a key contributor to a title contending team. The Magic made the playoffs every year he was a member (2007–2010), and competed in the 2009 NBA Finals in which they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIn Dec. 2010, Lewis was traded to the Washington Wizards for Gilbert Arenas, another player who considered to have a bad contract at the time. He would only play a season and a half for them and would be traded to the New Orleans Hornets for Trevor Ariza and Emeka Okafor in June 2012. He would never appear in a game for them.\n\nHe would finish his career as a member of the “Big-3” Miami Heat, signing with them in July 2012, and would contribute off the bench helping them win the 2013 NBA Finals. He’d play one more season with the Heat, earning some spot starts throughout the 2013–2014 NBA Playoffs and helping them get to the NBA Finals once again where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nLewis would sign with the Dallas Mavericks in 2014 but would not pass his physical, thus ending his career at 35. He would join Ice Cube’s Big3 league in it’s 2017 Inaugural season, helping the 3-Headed Monsters get to the Championship game where they lost. He has had another storied career in the Big3 league where the team’s website says he is still currently a member.\n\nRashard Lewis will always be memorable to me as he had a very unorthodox shot. As a member of the Orlando Magic he gave the Boston Celtics fits at times, and I will never forget how he stepped up for the Heat in the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, who had the Heat on edge.\n\nLewis’ game is reminiscent of a lot of Forwards in today’s NBA that can play both 3/4 spots. I see flashes of him in guys like Kyle Kuzma, Harrison Barnes, Pascal Siakam, and Tobias Harris. He also was a 2k GOD in 2k11 and 2k12 which earns him points in my book.\n\n#16 Carl Landry\n\nCarl Landry was a vastly underrated Power Forward out of Purdue who had to make his own opportunities every chance he got. He was a bit undersized but made up for it with heart and strength. He was recognized as one of the strongest players in the 2007 NBA Draft, when he hit 21 bench press reps.\n\nHe is most known for his time with the Sacramento Kings, but he was a well-traveled player so some may recognize him for his time with the Houston Rockets or the New Orleans Hornets. He also played for the Golden State Warriors and the Philadelphia 76ers in his career.\n\nLandry was a player who’s stats don’t really represent the player he was. He was a mid-range GOD and a valuable rebounder. While his highest rebounds average is only around 6 rebounds per game, the rebounds he got always felt timely.\n\nCarl Landry was drafted in the 2nd round of the 2007 NBA Draft by the Seattle SuperSonics and was traded to the Houston Rockets on draft night. He subsequently only played 3 of the first 36 games of his career for them but when Yao Ming went down with an injury mid-season, Landry appeared in 39 out of the final 46 games. He would average 8.1 points per game to go with 5 rebounds and would even finish in the top-10 voting for Rookie of the Year.\n\nLandry would up his average’s all the way to 16.1 points per game, 5.5 rebounds per game in his 3rd season. He would be traded mid-season in a 3-team deal that saw fan-favorite Kevin Martin leave the Kings and go to the Rockets. While with the Kings, Landry absolutely BALLED OUT. He would average 18 points and 6.5 rebounds a game to finish the ‘09-’10 season, earning votes for Most Improved Player and 6-Man of the Year. He would follow that up the following season with 11.9 points and 4.6 rebounds a game before being traded to the Hornets in a questionable move by the Kings mid-way through the ‘10-’11 season.\n\nLandry would be a solid rotational player earning 6-Man of the Year votes with the Hornets in the ‘11-’12 season and some in the ’12-’13 season while with the Warriors. In my opinion he never reached the high’s he did with the Kings in that 2009–2011 tenure. He would return to the Kings in 2013, and played for them until 2015 before finishing his career with the Philadelphia 76ers in the ‘15-’16 season.\n\nCarl Landry was a great rotational player who had some really solid high’s. He was a bright light during a dark Kings period when local fans didn’t have many players to look up to. His game was similar to players like Julius Randle (without the handles), Draymond Green, and Zion Williamson (not the star power) as far as skillset. He defended well, rebounded well, and was a smart player. Carl will forever be a Sactown legend.\n\n#15 Chase Budinger\n\nChase Budinger was a timeless role player who made the perfect athletic, 3 and D wing. Budinger is most known for participating in the 2012 NBA Dunk Contest and playing for the Houston Rockets. You also may know him for his second career as a professional beach volleyball player, something he has been doing since 2017 when he left the NBA.\n\nWhile at La Costa Canyon High School in Encinitas, CA, Chase Budinger would be a standout basketball and volleyball player leading them to a CIF Section title for basketball and 3 volleyball state championships. After coming from a volleyball family (both siblings played), many expected Budinger to go to USC or UCLA as they offered him for both sports. He would choose to focus on basketball and attend the University of Arizona. While at Arizona in ‘08–’09, Budinger would break the record for most minutes played in a season playing 1,317 minutes and finishing 11th in points in a season with 630 points.\n\nBudinger would go on to be drafted in the 2nd round of the 2009 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons and would be traded on draft night to the Houston Rockets. He came into the league as an NBA-ready role player appearing in 74 games, averaging 8.9 points, 3 rebounds, and 1.2 assists a game on 49/37/77% shooting. He would reach his career-high in points and games appeared in his second year, averaging 9.8 points per game in 78 appearances, starting in 22 of them.\n\nChase would be traded right before the 2012 NBA Draft to the Minnesota Timberwolves where he would play from 2012–2015. He would unfortunately tear his meniscus in the beginning of the 2012–2013 season. He would work his way back into becoming a rotational piece, playing 131 games for them over 3 seasons. The injuries would take a bit of a toll on Budinger’s body and he would not be the exact same player after.\n\nWhile his numbers may not stand out, Chase Budinger was the total package. He was a try-hard defender with length at 6'7 and could also play both Shooting Guard and Small Forward. He was a high flyer as can be seen in the 2012 Slam Dunk Contest where he finished second. In today’s era, almost every player has to fit into the Chase Budinger-mold. Robert Covington, Jimmy Butler, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby are all players who come from a similar mold as Budinger.\n\nBudinger was a 2K legend as well around 2K11–2K14 with a sweet stroke and good defense. He now can be found competing in the AVP beach volleyball league.\n\n#14 Von Wafer\n\nVakeaton “Von” Wafer was a fiery, 3&D athlete a bit like the previous hooper we spoke of. Wafer made his money in the league by being a streaky shooter. He is most know playing for the Rockets and Celtics but Wafer did not have an easy time staying in the NBA. His journey through the NBA is a testament of a player who had to bust his tail off just to stay in the league, something that could be seen in his play.\n\nWhile not being a a major player in the college recruiting scene, Wafer would have a junior season where he averaged 32/10/7 and would finally break out in the AAU circuit going into his senior year. He actually competed in the 2003 McDonald’s All-American slam-dunk contest against LeBron James and Shannon Brown. After 2 years at Florida State, Wafer would declare for the 2005 NBA Draft, something many draft experts did not agree with. In a draft workout for the Phoenix Suns, he would get in a scuffle with former Penn State-alum Jan Jagla.\n\nDespite all this, the Los Angeles Lakers would draft Wafer in the 2nd round of the 2005 draft. His rookie year would start off rocky as he would only appear in 15 games averaging 1.3 points. He would bounce from the G-League (formerly D-League) to a mid-season contract with the Nuggets being traded only 21 games into it and ending the season with the Portland Trail Blazers. He would sign with the Houston Rockets and play well enough in the pre-season to make the roster in the 2008–2009 season.\n\nIt was with the Rockets where Wafer would become a rotational role player. Tracy McGrady would get hurt and miss extended time opening up minutes at the Guard and Wing spot. Wafer took advantage scoring his career-high 23 points in a Jan. 2009 game against the Lakers, his former team. Wafer would go on to have another 20-point game vs. the Utah Jazz and make a game-winning three against the Boston Celtics that season. He’d help them as they made the playoffs, appearing in 13 games averaging 8.2 points and 1 rebound a game. The Rockets would make it to the second round pushing the Lakers to 7 games before being knocked out.\n\nHe’d crack top-10 in Most Improved Player voting losing out to Danny Granger in that same season. He was offered a second contract but could not pass a physical and played overseas in Greece until the 2009-2010 season when he was signed to a 10-day contract with the Dallas Mavericks. He’d be signed by the Boston Celtics going into the ‘10–’11 season, playing in 58 games averaging 3.2 points on 53% shooting. He was traded in Dec. 2011 to the Orlando Magic and would appear in 33 games averaging 5.9 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1 assists.\n\nWafer’s NBA career ended there with him bouncing from G-League to overseas, spending time in China and Russia until 2018. Wafer had a short, up-and-down career but left a lasting impact for multiple reasons. He played hard, had a cool name, was one of the first players to rock the fauxhawk fade haircut. He also was a killer in 2K as like a number of these guys on the list. Maybe it was 2K that got us kids into hoops.\n\nHis play, while maybe not reaching the same levels as some of them, is similar to guys like Malik Monk, Landry Shamet, Gary Trent Jr.\n\n#13 Stephen Jackson\n\nStephen Jackson a.k.a. Stak was the epitome of a 2000’s NBA role player. He was a bit controversial and polarizing, but he was WIDELY ahead of his time in many, many ways. He’s hit big shot after big shot in his career. It’s truly ridiculous he never made an All-Star team or even got many accolades for that matter. Jackson was a bit of a journeyman, so you may recognize him as a member of quite a few teams. He played for the Nets, Spurs, Hawks, Pacers, Warriors, Bobcats, Bucks and Clippers over his 14-year NBA career.\n\nJackson was drafted in the 2nd round of the 1997 NBA Draft out of Oak Hill Academy. He played in the 1996 McDonald’s All-American game and led the team in scoring with 21 points. He initially committed to the University of Arizona but low-test scores (something the NCAA has since removed) kept him ineligible. He would attend a junior college but not play. He attended a Suns workout before the ’97 season, thanks to Virginia Bibby, Mike Bibby’s mother, and would get a promise from Danny Ainge and Bryan Colangelo that they would draft him. He would be waived before the season.\n\nHe would bounce around internationally until before the ‘00-’01 season, when he was signed by the New Jersey Nets and debuted Oct. 31, earning a start and finishing with 15 points, 3 rebounds and 2 steals at Cleveland. He’d finish his rookie-year appearing in 77 games, and would average 8.2 points, 1.8 assists and 1.1 steals a game. He would sign the next season with San Antonio Spurs, but would miss 46-games due to injury.\n\nIt was his 3rd year (2nd with the Spurs), when he would finally arrive, averaging 11.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.6 steals getting some Most Improved Player votes. He hit quite a few clutch shots, and played a valuable role pacing the team as the 3rd leading scorer for the Spurs as they won their second-NBA Finals. As if all that wasn’t enough, Jackson’s journey would just be beginning, as he would sign with the Atlanta Hawks after winning a championship.\n\nHe’d take another step-forward with the Hawks, upping his averages to 18/4/3/1 before being traded to the Indiana Pacers after the ‘03-’04 season. His ‘04-’05 season would have been another step-forward if it wasn’t for the incident known as the “Malice at the Palace,” in which he was involved in a brawl with fans at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Detroit Pistons arena. He would go on to play 2 1/2 seasons with the Pacers, averaging 16.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.2 steals\n\nMid-way through the ‘06-’07 season he’d be traded to the Golden State Warriors in an 8-player deal. He would help the “We Believe” Warriors become the first 8-seed team to upset a 1-seed over the Dallas Mavericks in 2007 NBA Playoffs, scoring 33 in the series-clinching Game 6 setting a franchise-playoff record with 7 threes. After another 2 1/2 seasons, Jackson would be subsequently traded to the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nStack’s game would go up another level in the ‘09-’10 season with the Bobcats. He would help them make the NBA Playoffs for the first time in their new-history, leading them in points per game at 21.1. He would also garner MVP-votes, finishing 12th in 2010. The Bobcats would be swept in the first round by the Orlando Magic and would not make it again in his tenure (‘09–’11).\n\nFrom 2011 to the end of his career, he would bounce around from the Milwaukee Bucks, back to the Spurs where he had another chance to play for a championship-contender, before finishing his career after only 9 games with the Clippers. Jackson did not have a normal career, and he truly is the NBA’s “Forrest Gump” playing in so many huge NBA moments. Some good, and some not so, but he was the true epitome of a 2000’s player. His game is exactly what you want from a 2020-era player. He was a wing who could be the point-forward and playmake, or be a role-player who knows when to pass, cut, or shoot. His game is very similar to guys like Paolo Banchero, or Jimmy Butler, and his influence can be seen in guys like Jaylen Brown, Michael Porter Jr., and Mikal Bridges.\n\n#12 Eddie House\n\nEddie House was a sharpshooting-Point Guard who is most known for his time as a member of the Boston Celtics, notably winning the 2008 NBA Finals. Eddie was a true spark-off-the-bench role-player who was mainly a shooter, but also played with IQ and rarely made bad decisions. He was one of the first players I noticed that would look for shots without the ball. He played for 9 teams (Heat, Clippers, Bobcats, Bucks, Kings, Suns, Nets, Celtics, and Knicks) in his 11-year career.\n\nHouse was drafted by the Miami Heat in the second round of the infamous 2000 NBA Draft, which is known for being historically bad out of Arizona State University. He is currently the program’s all-time leading scorer, leader in steals, and points in a game. He scored a career-high 61 points against Cal, a school he had indicated he wanted to go to but did not offer him.\n\nHe would appear in 169 games over 3 seasons with the Heat, averaging 7 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 1.6 assists while also shooting 40% from three. Before the ‘03–’04 season, House would sign with the Los Angeles Clippers before being traded to the Bobcats to clear up cap-space for the Clips to make a massive offer to Kobe Bryant. In the ‘04-’05 season, House would be traded twice; first to the Bucks, and then to the Kings to finish the year.\n\nIt was in the ‘05-’06 season, that House would gain national notoriety as a member of the Phoenix Suns. He’d average a career-high 9.8 points in 81 games, garnering 6-Man of the Year votes and playing a bench-role for the team as they got to the Western Conference Finals. He’d sign with the New Jersey Nets in the off-season and appear in 56-games but was used sparingly in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.\n\nHouse would take another step-forward in the 2007–2008 season as a member of the Boston Celtics. He was a backup to both Guard spots, and played a key-role appearing in 78-games and providing crucial minutes in the playoffs. In the following ‘08-’09 season, he would take his scoring average up to 8.5 points per game and appear in 81-games. He would again earn 6-Man of the Year votes. He’d play half a season with the Celtics in ‘09–’10 and would be traded to the New York Knicks before ending his career after the ‘10-’11 season with the Miami Heat who lost in the 2011 NBA Finals.\n\nOver his career, House was known as a spark-plug scorer, his off-ball movement was vital in his play. While he brought up the ball, he wasn’t thought to be a primary ball-handler. The role he played has actually changed a bit. While there still are some shooting-spark plugs off the bench like Malik Beasley, or Malcolm Brogdon, or Payton Pritchard, I think the role of a player like Eddie House has evolved a bit to wing sharpshooters like Sam Hauser, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Khris Middleton. All of whom are capable of bringing the ball up, but are mostly looking for their spots to get the shots they want. He was a legend in the NBA Live games, and will always be a Celtic4life.\n\n#11 John Salmons\n\nJohn Salmons the definition of an NBA role-player. Salmons was most notably a member of the ‘08-’09 Chicago Bulls, who took the defending champ Boston Celtics to 7-games in the first round of the ’09 NBA Playoffs. He was also one of the few highlight players during a low-point of Sacramento Kings basketball, which would turn into a 16-year playoff drought.\n\nSalmons was drafted out of the University of Miami by the San Antonio Spurs with the 26th pick in the 2002 NBA Draft. He would be traded draft night to the Philadelphia 76ers, his home-state team.\n\nSalmons attended Plymouth Whitemarsh High School, in Plymouth Meeting, Penn. where he reached the 1,000 point club and helped lead them to a state championship in 1997. According to Rick Kauffman of the Times Herald, he wasn’t even considered the best player on his high school team. That honor went to Chuck Moore, who’d go on to play for Seton Hall and Vanderbilt.\n\nSalmons would go on to play 4 years at Miami where his #15 is retired. He start 107-consecutive games for the Hurricanes, averaging 10.4 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 3.5 assists. While there, he would never lead the team in scoring. He would play his first 4 years with the 76ers, peaking in his 4th year with 7.5 points a game. Salmons would say he didn’t think being drafted by his home team was necessarily good for him.\n\nIn July 2006, Salmons would sign a 5/$25 million contract with the Sacramento Kings. With the Kings, Salmons would have his best years, upping his averages each year climibing up to 18.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 3.2 assists in his 7th year (3rd with Kings). He was traded mid-season in ’08-’09 to the Bulls and finish in the top-10 for the Most Improved Player award. He would finally get to showcase all his talents in his seasons with the Kings and Bulls.\n\nSalmons would be traded again to the Milwaukee Bucks, mid-season in the ‘09-’10 season with his contract set to expire. He’d sign a 5/$39 million contract with the Bucks which was considered a very HEFTY amount at that time. He’d be traded after one season, back to the Kings before finishing his career with stops in Toronto and New Orleans over 81-games and retiring after the ‘14-’15 season.\n\nSalmons was a lanky, slithery, Guard/Forward, who could also play point. He is definitely from the Paul Pierce-tree of players. His game is seen throughout the league. His dribble-style is a bit similar to James Harden and he could go on spurts where you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. In today’s NBA, I believe Salmons’ influence is prominent in guys like Herb Jones, Miles Bridges, and Kelly Oubre. I’d go as far as to say Paul George with less agility and explosiveness. Salmons was another guy who made the league what it is today, and doesn’t get enough credit for being ahead of his time.\n\n#10 James Posey\n\nJames Posey is another guy who was a traditional role player throughout his college and NBA career. He is most known as a member of the 2008 Boston Celtics championship team. Posey was considered a defensive stopper and swingman capable of playing both Forward spots, something that was very ahead of it’s time, as his height, 6'8\", was considered greatly undersized for a Power Forward at the time.\n\nPosey was drafted as the 18th pick of the 1999 NBA Draft out of Xavier University to the Denver Nuggets. While at Xavier, Posey came off the bench as the team’s 6th man for 2 out of the 3 seasons he played there and he is currently 3rd in steals in the program’s history.\n\nPosey would be a starter for the Nuggets, being named to the All-Rookie Second Team averaging 8.2 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 1.8 assists. He would score a career-high 33 points in his 3rd season vs. the Golden State Warriors. He’d be traded mid-season of his 4th year (‘02-’03 season) to the Houston Rockets appearing in 58 games for them. In the summer of 2003, Posey would sign with the Memphis Grizzlies and this is when he’d start to gain some national recognition.\n\nIn his first year with the Grizzlies, Posey would showcase all the skills that got him to his 5th year in the NBA. He’d average 13.7 points, 5 rebounds, and 1.7 steals a game garnering Defensive Player of the Year votes and finishing in the top-3 for Most Improved Player voting. In March 2004, Posey scored a new career-high 38 points, hitting a game-tying shot against the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nShortly before the ‘05-’06 season, Posey was traded in the largest NBA trade in NBA history and would end up on the Miami Heat. The Heat had just come off a season in which they traded for Shaquille O’Neal and were contender for an NBA Championship. Posey would start majority of the ‘05-’06 season but would be somewhat disappointing averaging a career-low in points (7.2). During the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Posey would be relegated to the bench as the team’s 6th man and make up for the disappointing regular season.\n\nWhile helping the Miami Heat win the 2006 NBA Finals, Posey would play his role perfectly, hitting open shots as Shaq and Dwyane Wade were doubled. Posey was also tasked with primarily guarding the other teams best players such as Vince Carter, Richard Jefferson, Rip Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, and even Dirk Nowitzki. Posey would have a 15/10 rebound game in Game 4 of the 2006 NBA Finals and would also hit a clutch three in the Game 6 clinching win over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAfter running it back with the Heat for the 2006–2007 season, Posey would leave in free agency to the Boston Celtics before the ‘07-’08 season. Posey would play a very similar role for the Boston Celtics, coming off the bench in all but 2 games that year and appearing in every playoff game. Posey would provide crucial defense on LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, and one memory I’ll always have of him is from Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals. The Celtics had come back from down-24, in which Posey played a major role in. Kobe would get the Lakers back to within 2, 89–87, with a 1:30 left on the clock, and “Big Game James” would hit an absolute dagger three to go up 92–87 which at that time might as well have been a 20-point lead. The rest was history and he was a champion again.\n\nPosey would garner 6th-Man of the Year votes that season and some the following season (‘08-’09) with a new team, the New Orleans Hornets. He would help them make the playoffs that year before being eliminated in the first round by his former team, the Nuggets. Posey would play 1 more season with the Hornets, before ending his career with one season as a member of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nPosey is now an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards, and won another NBA Championship as a coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. He was a key role player on 2 separate championship teams and his staple knee-high socks will always be a part of his legacy. His game is very similar to wing-defenders in today’s NBA like Jae Crowder, De’Andre Hunter, OG Anunoby all whom are capable of standing in the corner and hitting three’s as well.\n\n#9 Mike Miller\n\nMike Miller was a sharpshooting wing who is most known for his time as a member of the “Big-3\" Heat. He won 2 championships alongside LeBron, Wade, and Bosh.\n\nMiller was the 5th pick of the 2000 NBA Draft, a draft that is infamous for being weaker than usual, being selected by the Orlando Magic. Miller quickly rose the rankings, being named the 2001 NBA Rookie of the Year, averaging 11.9 points while shooting 40% from three. After 2 1/2 seasons, Miller was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies mid-way through the ’02-’03 NBA season.\n\nIt took Miller time to get used to Memphis, but by his 3rd season in Memphis (‘05-’06) he had found a role, winning the NBA’s 6-Man of the Year award as the team’s second leading scorer exclusively coming off the bench. He’d set records for three’s in a game (9) and most points in a game (45) during his time there before being traded during the 2008 NBA Draft to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nMiller’s time with the Timberwolves would be a sign of things to come, he would average a career-low in points (9.9) but a career-high in assists (4.5). He’d spend a season in Minnesota before being traded to the Washington Wizards for draft capital again. The packaged would net the Wolves the 5th pick in the 2009 Draft (Ricky Rubio). He’d spend one season with the Wizards battling a shoulder injury, averaging 10.9 points a game, his last double-digit scoring season of his career.\n\nMiller would sign with the Miami Heat in the free agency summer of 2010, reuniting with his college teammate, Udonis Haslem. Miller would be the perfect role player for the Heat, alongside the Big-3. His numbers wouldn’t scream spectacular and he would battle a nagging back injury, but Miller came through when needed. He would play every game in the Heat’s 2012 NBA Finals victory while shooting 42% from three. He’d follow the same recipe in the 2013 NBA Playoffs, even being called upon to start in the ’13 NBA Finals, and helping the Heat win back-to-back championships. Miller would be waived following the 2nd championship.\n\nMiller would play one last full season with the Memphis Grizzlies, helping the “grit-and-grind” Grizzlies to the 2014 NBA Playoffs, appearing in all 82-games and all 7-playoff games. Miller would only appear in 119 more games over his final three seasons, spending some time with the Cleveland Cavaliers during their 2015 NBA Finals run, and finishing his career with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nMiller was a sharpshooter, on 50/40/70 shooting splits over his 17-year NBA career. He was also a killer in most every NBA video game there was and he was one of the cool white guys of the NBA when there was some. His influence can be seen across the NBA, but specifically in a few players like Desmond Bane, Herb Jones, and Christian Braun. After being an assistant coach for the University of Memphis, and coaching his son’s high school team, he is now enjoying retirement.\n\n#8 Kevin Martin\n\nKevin Martin was the arguably one of the best Sacramento Kings during their 16-year playoff drought. He was a straight scorer, with an unorthodox jump shot. He was notably in the first James Harden trade that took him to Oklahoma City and Harden to Houston. He was also in the failed trade attempt that would have took him to New Orleans in the vetoed Chris Paul to LA Lakers trade.\n\nK-Mart was drafted 26th out of Western Carolina in the ’04 NBA Draft. In highschool, he finished 4th for the Mr. Ohio award behind LeBron James. He was the 7th player ever drafted from Western Carolina and only appeared in 45 games his rookie year. Martin’s second year would be a bump up as he would get votes for Most Improved Player, and then again in his third year (‘07). The 2006–2007 Most Improved Player award would finish as the NBA’s closest contest ever with Martin losing out to Monta Ellis.\n\nAs the Kings entered a transitional period, Martin would get a huge pay day (for the time), signing a 5-year/$55 million deal. K-Mart would take another step-forward after this(‘07-‘08 season), averaging 23.7 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 2 assists on 40% shooting from three. He would become the leader of the team ahead of the ‘09 season as Ron Artest was traded. This would lead to his best year, averaging a career-high 24.6 points, while shooting a career-high 41% from three. On April 1, 2009, K-Mart would score a career-high, 50 points, against the Golden State Warriors but unfortunately would battle groin and ankle injuries missing 52 games before being traded to the Houston Rockets at the 2010 NBA Trade Deadline.\n\nWith the Rockets, Martin had an up-and-down year to finish the 2010 season but would drop 39 against his former team, the Kings. His ‘10-‘11 season would be a return to normalcy, as Martin would play in 80 games and get back to himself, averaging 23.5 points on 38% shooting from three. Martin would be traded in Oct. 2012 to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Harden and it would take him some time to adapt.\n\nThough having a down year for him and coming off the bench, Martin would still have a good season, finishing 4th for 6-Man of the Year voting averaging 14 points on 42% shooting from three. He’d play his final 3 seasons for the Minnesota Timberwolves and San Antonio Spurs, battling a couple of injuries. Martin would make the best of it, still averaging around 16 points a game on 38% shooting before being waived by the Wolves. He’d go on to play 21 more games with the Spurs, making his last appearance in the 2016 NBA Playoffs with the Spurs.\n\nIf you’re a Kings fan who was too young for the ‘01/‘02 Kings Teams, I bet you were a K-Mart fan. His game was that of a scorer from all levels, something we did not have much of on the Kings. Players that remind me of him now are players like Cam Thomas, Malik Monk, Jordan Clarkson, and Jordan Poole. Martin had one of the most unorthodox shots I can remember (reminds me a bit of Lonzo Ball) but I’ll never forget his time as a King. Sacramento loves you Kevin!\n\n#7 Dorell Wright\n\nDorell “D3” Wright was a sharpshooting wing. His lanky, athleticism, helped him as a good rebounder and solid defender earning him the spot of a role player for multiple teams over his career. He’s most notable as a Golden State Warrior, where he averaged career-highs, but you also may know him as Delon Wright’s older brother. He is currently an analyst for NBC Sports Bay Area.\n\nDorell Wright was apart of one of the deepest high school classes in the NBA Draft ever. He was the eighth high schooler drafted in the 2004 NBA Draft, in which all were drafted before the 20th pick. Originally from Los Angeles, Wright decided a prep year would do him best, so he attened South Kent Prep in Connecticut. His decision would be proven correct averaging 29 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 blocks a game. Wright worked his way up to the 12th ranked recruit in the nation and committed to DePaul. After attending the NBA’s pre-draft camp, Wright admitted to Andy Katz of ESPN, “I need to be in the first 20 (to stay in the draft).”\n\nAgain, Wright was correct, as the 19th selection by the Miami Heat. His career would begin very rocky, only appearing in 23-games his first 2 seasons with the Heat, bouncing back-and-forth between the NBA and G-League. He did win a championship in his second season as a member of the Heat but did not play. He would play 6 seasons for the Heat, playing in 211-games and averaging around 6 points, 4 rebounds a game. In July 2010, Wright would sign with the Golden State Warriors, and his career as a role player would finally begin.\n\nHis first season with the Warriors would be a career-year, averaging 16.4 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists a game while making 2 three’s a game on 37% shooting. He’d hit a franchise-record (at the time), 9 threes in a game and start in all 82 games for the Warriors. He’d also participate in the 2011 NBA 3-Point Contest and had 16 of his highest scoring games in the ‘10-’11 season, with a career-high 34 points coming against the Houston Rockets. He’d come in 3rd for Most Improved Player voting losing out to Kevin Love. His 2012 season would be more of the same, but his minutes and stats would take a dip under new-coach Mark Jackson. He was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, who were just coming off a first round upset over the Chicago Bulls in a series when Derrick Rose tore his ACL.\n\nAs a member of the 76ers, Wright would provide wing-depth and shooting off the bench, but his minutes would never be the same. He had been relegated to a bench-role and that’s how the rest of his career went. He would play 2 more seasons with the Portland Trailblazers alongside a young Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. He’d only play around 14 minutes a game being used as a depth wing behind Nic Batum but did help them in the 2014 NBA Playoffs. Wright would be signed one more time by the Miami Heat, strictly for the playoffs but would only appear in 5 games.\n\nWright was a sniper, who could rebound and defend. He was a long, lanky defender in a 6'8 frame that made you feel like he was capable of guarding anyone. He gained my attention for being a sniper, and his character in 2K11–2K14 was always legendary, my favorite being when he played for the 76ers in 2K12. Thought his time as a role player was short-lived, he made an impression as a shooter. His brother, Delon, can now carry on the family legacy of being a role player with the Miami Heat currently.\n\n#6 Jason Richardson\n\nJason Richardson is arguably one of the most overqualified role players in NBA history. He’s known as a posterizing, powerful dunker, who also doubled as a 2-way guard with a smooth jumper. J-Rich was the total package and was well-traveled playing for 5 teams, leaving an impression on all of them. He is also known for being one of the best dunkers of the 2000's.\n\nJason Richardson was the #5 overall selection in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors out of Michigan State. As a senior, Richardson led Arthur Hill High School to the Michigan state title game and was a McDonald’s All-American. He would go up the street to play for Tom Izzo at Mich. State and play 2 seasons. In his freshman year as a 6th-man, they would win the 2000 NCAA National Championship, playing alongside future NBA players, Mateen Cleaves, Mo Peterson, Charlie Bell, and current-Suns owner, Matt Ishbia.\n\nAfter leading Michigan State to a Final Four appearance, Richardson would declare for the draft and start his career with the Warriors. His rookie year showed he was NBA-ready, starting in 75 out of 80 games, finishing 3rd in Rookie of the Year voting and winning the 2002 NBA Dunk Contest. He’d also win the 2003 NBA Dunk Contest as a sophomore. Over the next 3 years, Richardson would up his averages every year getting up to 23.2 points per-game in the ‘05-’06 season, however the Warriors did not make playoffs any of those years. Richardson would put together an apology in the newspaper for continuously missing the playoffs. The following year (2007), the 8-seed Warriors would upset the 1-seed Dallas Mavericks, making NBA history. Richardson would actually have a down season that year but did play a pivotal role in the playoffs. Following the season, Richardson was traded on draft night to the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nAs a Bobcat, Richardson would get back to his 20+ points per game, and started in all 82 games that year. He also led the league in 3-pointers made that season while shooting 40% but the Bobcats would finish 32–50 and miss the playoffs. He would be traded mid-season in the ‘08-’09 season to the Phoenix Suns, as the Bobcats looked to get more size and the Suns wanted someone to pair with the core of Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire, and Shaq.\n\nWith the Suns, Richardson would start to see his numbers dip below the 20ppg he was used to. They would actually miss the playoffs that first season. Richardson’s second year, the Suns would make a Western Conference Finals run, with him having a playoff career-high 42 points in the first round. He would have to play both sides of the ball, as the Suns counted on his defense throughout the playoffs. Midway through his 3rd season with the Suns (‘10-’11), he would be traded again, this time to the Orlando Magic.\n\nAs a member of the Orlando Magic, Richardson would start to show signs of father time catching up to him and would face some knee issues. At 30, he was averaging his lowest point total (15.6) since his 2nd year but still shot 47% and 38% from three. He’d still help the Magic make the playoffs, but would lose in the first round to the Atlanta Hawks. His second season with the Magic, J-Rich averaged a career-low 11.6 points per game, and would only appear 54 games, hampered by injury. Following the 2012 season, Richardson would be traded for the 4th time, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers, as a part of the Dwight Howard to LA trade. He’d only appear in 33 games, but still averaged 10.5 points per game on 40% shooting. He’d miss all of the 2013–14 season and would come back in 2014–15 but only appeared in 19 games. Richardson would make his last appearance in 2015, recording 19 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists, and 1 steal. He would sign in the off-season before the ‘15-’16 season with the Hawks but would retire before ever playing a game for them.\n\nRichardson currently plays for Tri State in Ice Cube’s Big3 league, and his time as an NBA player really left an imprint on many kids like me. He seemed almost like the perfect player. I could never understand why he was always getting traded, but it’s because he was indeed the perfect role player.\n\nRichardson was an all-around, dunking machine, that played any role asked of him. You don’t see many players who are willing to do that anymore, but his influence is in every player today. His play-style was similar to guys like Jaylen Brown, Donovan Mitchell, and Anthony Edwards, all of whom are lofty comparisons, but trust me J-Rich was THAT GUY.\n\n#5 J.R. Smith\n\nEarl “J.R.” Smith is the flashiest guy on this list. Smith was one of the best Robin’s in NBA history. He was a true shooting guard, 2-way ability, 360 dunks, lights-out shooting, make the “woo” plays, guy. Before winning 2 championships with LeBron, Smith was known as a fiery, streak-shooter, with hops out the gym.\n\n“Swish” as he was known, was drafted with the 18th overall selection in the 2004 NBA Draft by the New Orleans Hornets. Smith was originally supposed to join Marvin Williams, Raymond Felton, and Rashad McCants at the University of North Carolina. In 2004, Smith would have stellar performances in the Nike Summer Circuit, and would win co-MVP with the soon-to-be #1 pick, Dwight Howard, at the 2004 McDonald’s All-American Game and would shoot up draft projections getting projected to go in the teens in the draft. He’d take his chances.\n\nAs a rookie, Smith would crack the top-5 in Rookie of the Year voting, averaging 10.3 points a game on 39% shooting. He had a bit of a sophomore slump as he fell out of favor with coach Byron Scott and would only appear in 55 games averaging 7 points a game and was shipped after the season to the Chicago Bulls before being redirected to the Denver Nuggets.\n\nWith the Nuggets, Smith would find his groove, his first season he’d miss games due to suspension and injury, he’d average 13 points on 39% shooting and would get votes for 6th-Man of the Year. He’d be benched by coach George Karl in the 2007 NBA Playoffs. From 2006–2011, Smith would average 13.6 points on 38% shooting from three and would be in Most Improved Player votes, as well as 6th-Man of the Year votes. His time with the Nuggets was seen as glowing for him, but was a disappointment for the Nuggets overall as they had just gotten Allen Iverson in a trade but would lose in the 1st round back-to-back years. Smith’s teammate, Carmelo Anthony would be traded to the Knicks before the end of the ‘10-’11 season, and Smith would sign with them before the following season.\n\nIn his first full season as a member of the New York Knicks, Smith would have have a career season in, averaging a career-high 18.1 points, 5.3 rebounds, and would finally be awarded the NBA’s 6th-Man of the Year, his seventh year being nominated in a row. He would play about 3 seasons in New York, showcasing his shooting talent, and high-flying ability while helping the Knicks be contenders for the championship. He’d be traded midway through the ‘14-’15 season to join the LeBron James-led Cavaliers.\n\nSmith’s time with the Cavs was not as stats driven as his previous years (his highest averages with them being 12.7 points per game) but it would still be as marvelous to see. Smith would win a championship as a member of the 2016 Cavaliers and he played a pivotal role, as every role player on that team did. Smith could go on scoring outbursts by himself when it was absolutely necessary. He’d play 5 seasons in Cleveland before ending his career in the “Bubble” COVID-season. He would play sparingly but would win a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers before riding into the sunset.\n\nJ.R. Smith was an absolute microwave who was the definition of a player you didn’t want to get hot. His shooting ability could go from off-to-on so quickly, and his athleticism made him a fan favorite in his younger years getting him a spot in the 2005 NBA Dunk Contest.\n\nSwish was a modern-type of player and his game is that of a microwave scorer. His game is reminiscent of players like Tim Hardaway Jr., Devin Booker, and Ben Mathurin.\n\n#4 Ben Gordon\n\nOf all the sharpshooters on this list, Ben Gordon was the definition of a sharpshooter. Gordon was a deadeye, clutch, Shooting Guard. He was most known for his time as a Chicago Bull, where he got most of his accolades and won 6th Man of the Year.\n\nBen Gordon was highly touted coming off an NCAA National Championship with the UConn Huskies, and he was drafted #3 overall in the 2004 NBA Draft by the Bulls. He made an immediate impact, along with fellow rookie-Luol Deng, helping the Bulls win over 30 games for the first time since Michael Jordan retired in 1998.\n\nGordon would hit the ground running, averaging 15 points a game on 40% shooting from three. He’d finish second in Rookie of the Year voting, but would be the first rookie to ever win the NBA 6th-Man of the Year award. He’d help the Bulls clinch the #4 seed and would jump to a 2–0 series lead before losing in the first round to the Washington Wizards. Gordon would improve all his stats in his second season and would help the Bulls to the playoffs but would lose in the first round again. Gordon’s third year would mark his career-high in points averaging 21.4 points, to go with 3.6 assists, and 3.1 rebounds, he would garner some Most Improved votes and would help the Bulls get to the second round as the team’s leading scorer. His fourth year (2008), he would take a step back in points but would still be in the top-5 for 6th-Man voting. This season was an up-and-down year for him, with his shooting being a bit streaky during the season. The Bulls would finish with the 9th worst record but would win the 2008 draft lottery and would get the #1 pick, Derrick Rose being the selection.\n\nGordon would accept his qualifying offer and would play one last season for the Bulls, saving his best for last in the 2008 NBA Playoffs, having a 42-point game and a 33-point in game 7.\n\nAfter the season, Gordon would sign a huge contract with the Detroit Pistons, but would still be relegated to a sixth man role. He would begin to battle ankle injuries but in his last year with them (2012) he had a 45-point game. He would be traded to the Charlotte Bobcats ahead of the 2013 NBA season and would play 2 years there, but would not be the player we once knew. He’d finish his career playing 56-games for the Orlando Magic in the 2015 NBA season.\n\nGordon was a sharpshooting, combo guard, who many considered undersized to play the 2-guard. He stayed relevant with his clutch shooting, and ability to go off for 40 points at any time. His career was very short but it meant everything to young fans who were mesmerized by his 3-point shooting prowess. Players that remind me of Ben Gordon currently are guys like Tyler Herro, Kevin Huerter, and Bradley Beal. All of whom are capable of going off on any night as well but have some low games too.\n\n#3 Andre Iguodola\n\nAndre Iguodola, also known as Iggy, is arguably the best role player of the 2000’s. He probably should be #1 on this list if it was purely based on talent and accolades. He’s most know for his time with the Golden State Warriors, winning 4 NBA Championship’s as a key role player alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.\n\nHow I will always remember Iggy will be from his tenure as a Philadelphia 76er. Iggy was drafted 9th overall in the 2004 NBA Draft out of the University of Arizona. Iggy was a touted 4-star high school athlete, playing basketball and doing high-jump on the track team. He would garner attention in the AAU circuit playing alongside Dwyane Wade, Quentin Richardson, and current-Duke coach Jon Scheyer. He was originally committed to Arkansas but after coach Nolan Richardson was fired, he would reconsider and choose Arizona.\n\nAndre would spend 2 seasons at Arizona, showcasing his wide variety of talent. In his freshman season, he would rank in the top-5 for every statistical category while coming off the bench. His sophomore season would see his averages go up as a full-time starter, averaging 13 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5 assists per game.\n\nWhen Iguodola was drafted, a few criticized the pick as they questioned his ability to shoot. Iggy would make an immediate impact, starting every game alongside Allen Iverson, becoming a lob-target for Iverson and defending his butt off, garnering Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) votes in his rookie season (!!!) to go with Rookie of the Year (ROY) votes as well. By his 3rd season, Iggy would become the de-facto leader as Iverson was traded away. He’d respond by upping his averages to 18.2 points, 5.7 rebound, 5.7 assists, and 2 steals per game. He’d garner either DPOY or Most Improved votes every year over his first 5 seasons. Over his first 6 seasons, he’d only miss 6-games total.\n\nHis 4th season, Iggy would lead the 6ers to the playoffs, losing in the first round of the 2008 NBA Playoffs to the Detroit Pistons. He would receive a HUGE 6yrs/$80 million contract. Following the success of a young prospect named Thaddeus Young and a big signing in all-star, Elton Brand, the 76ers would again make the playoffs in 2009, and would show that they had found some core pieces. In the 2010 season, the 76ers would take a step back and would miss the playoff’s, but they would draft a few more pieces to go along with their core in Jrue Holiday and Jodie Meeks. The 76ers were counting to rebound going into the 2011 season and drafted #2 overall pick, Evan Turner. They would make the playoffs but lose in the first round again to the Miami Heat. Iggy would make the NBA All-Defensive Second Team, but quite a few coaches and teammates agreed he deserved the 1st team. Iggy would finally crack the All-Star team he had deserved so much during his career in the 2012 NBA season. The 6ers would make the playoffs, and upset the Chicago Bulls in the first round. This would be his last season with the 6ers, as he was traded ahead of the 2013 NBA season.\n\nAnother member in the Dwight Howard trade, Iggy would land in Denver, playing for the Nuggets for one season and helping them get to the #3 seed in the West. They would be upset in the first round by a young Golden State team, and after the season that’s exactly where Iguodola would sign.\n\nWith the Warriors, Iguodola’s role would change massively. As his career had gone, he had gone from sidekick, to main event, to team leader, to now veteran role player. His role as the elder statesmen for a young Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be pivotal and would help elevate the Warriors. In his first season with the Warriors, Iguodola would average under 10 points for the first time in his career (9.3) but would make the All-Defense First Team and crack top-5 in Defensive Player of the Year voting. The Warriors would make the 2014 playoffs but would lose in the first round taking the “Lob-city” Clippers to 7 games. The rest was history.\n\nFrom 2014–2019, The Warriors would go on to win 3 out of 5 NBA Championships becoming a dynasty and going face-to-face with LeBron James-led teams. They would also make the NBA Finals 5 years in a row. Iggy would receive 6MOY votes 4 out of those 5 seasons.\n\nAfter 6 seasons with the Warriors, Iggy would be traded for cap-space purposes and would spend more than half the season holding out on the Memphis Grizzlies, as both parties agreed best to look for a trade. In Feb. 2020, Iguodola would be traded to the Miami Heat and would help them get to the 2020 NBA “bubble” Finals. He appeared in every game as a depth piece as the Heat lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. He would spend one more season with the Heat but they would be eliminated in the first round of the 2021 NBA Playoffs.\n\nIguodola would return to the Warriors mostly as a player-coach, helping bring along some younger players like Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga. The Warriors would make it back to the NBA Finals in 2022 and would win one last time cementing Iggy’s legacy as a 4x champ. He’d play one more year but the Warriors would lose in the second round of the 2024 NBA playoffs.\n\nIggy was the complete role player. I don’t think we can ever expect to see a guy like him again. He was a star who accepted a lesser role for the sake of winning. That just doesn’t happen often. Players that resemble him in the league today span all over the map, everyone wants to be an all-around wing defender, players like Jayson Tatum, Miles Bridges and even guys like Grant Williams and Rui Hachimura.\n\n#2 Jeff Green\n\nJeff Green might not be as deserving as the top-role player of all-time as Iguodola, but again, it’s my favorites. Now Jeff Green is no slouch, he’s been in the NBA for 15 years for a reason. Jeff Green is a valuable role player who has grown into a complete vet. He is well travelled, and currently playing, so there is a number of ways you may know him.\n\nJeff Green’s career started with a trade, as he was traded draft night of the 2007 NBA Draft from the Boston Celtics to the Seattle Sonics in exchange for Ray Allen. Jeff was projected to be a lottery pick after leading Georgetown on a surprise Final Four run alongside big-man Roy Hibbert. He spent 3 seasons there ranking in the top-3 in points, rebounds, and assists, every season he was there.\n\nGreen’s rookie season he would appear in 80 games, averaging 10 points, and 4 rebounds a game, making the All-Rookie First Team. His second season would mark the relocation of the Sonics to Oklahoma City as the Thunder. He would get votes for Most Improved Player as he’d take his points up to 16.5, 6.7 rebounds, and shoot 39% from three. In Green’s third year his averages would dip a little but he would score a career-high 37 points in a game that season vs. the New Jersey Nets. As the team’s third leading scorer, he would help the OKC Thunder get to the 2010 NBA Playoffs, a first of 5-straight playoff appearances. There were questions about whether Green could be the third star alongside Westbrook and Durant and with the development of James Harden, unfortunately, that question was answered. Green would be traded day of the 2011 NBA Trade Deadline to the Boston Celtics for Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson.\n\nThis would start a trend of going from team-to-team but only because what Green brings to the table is so valuable. He would finish the 2011 season with the Celtics and just before the 2012 NBA “Lockout” was going to end, Jeff was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm and would be forced to miss the whole 2012 season, if not end his career.\n\nLuckily, Green would rehab and make it back for the 2013 NBA Season, he would play in 81 games too, averaging 12.8 points a game. Green would become a key starter for the 2014 Boston Celtics, as they had just traded Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett away in favor of a rebuild. With the increase in usage, Green would take a step-forward, averaging a career-high 16.9 points a game. With the Celtics going through a rebuild, Green would be traded mid-way through the 2015 season to the Memphis Grizzlies and this would begin a long journey for Jeff as a key contributor on every team he played. His contributions mainly amounted to depth role player but it included an NBA Finals run with the 2018 Cavaliers, and an NBA Championship with the Denver Nuggets in 2023.\n\nGreen currently plays for the Houston Rockets, as a bit of a player-coach, and his game really shows the evolution from guys like Andre Iguodola to guys like Jayson Tatum. Jeff is a happy-medium, and is the epitome of the new era role-players. He’s played 15 years across 11 teams, and contributed to every single one of them. His influences may not be as influential as others on this list, but they will be as we get further away from the old NBA. Players that are similar to Jeff are guys like Jerami Grant, Tobias Harris, and Keegan Murray.\n\n#1 Mickaël Piétrus\n\nMickaël Piétrus is my #1 favorite role player of all time. You most likely would remember him for his time with the Orlando Magic, where he made a 2009 NBA Finals appearance. He also played for the Warriors, Celtics, Suns, and Raptors in his 10-year career.\n\nPiétrus, nicknamed Air France, was an international player unlike any other. He was drafted 11th by the Golden State Warriors in the famous 2003 NBA Draft (the LeBron draft). Before coming to the U.S., Piétrus had quite a story. He was born on a French Caribbean island called Guadeloupe and left when he was 15 to play for the Pau Orthez junior program in France. While a member of EB Pau Orthez, he would win the French League championship in 2001 and 2003 while also winning the national-French Cup in 2002. He’d also make the All-Star game 3 out of his 4 seasons in France.\n\nBeing drafted by the Warriors, Piétrus was touted for his defensive ability and athleticism to guard both Guards and Forwards. His rookie year would be a bit tumultuous as his playing time would bounce around and he would only appear in 53 games, however he would start the last 22 games of the season and would average 9.3 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1 steal per game. He would showcase his shooting ability that many experts felt he would need to work on while also showing his defensive potential going up against Tracy McGrady, Tony Parker, and Gilbert Arenas. Piétrus’ second season would mark a step up for him as he would appear in 67 games, averaging 9.5 points, while making 1 three a game. This was the season his potential and growth would really start to flash. He would get Most Improved Player votes. He would spend 3 more seasons with the Warriors, one of which he would average a career-high 11.1 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1 assist a game while shooting 38% from three while making 72 appearances. He would also be a key contributor in the 2007 NBA Playoffs, having a double-double 14/10 game in the first round vs. the Mavericks.\n\nAfter becoming a key contributor for the Warriors, Piétrus would leave and sign with the Magic ahead of the ‘08-’09 season. Orlando GM Otis Smith had originally drafted Piétrus and saw him as a key player to defend guys like LeBron and Dwyane Wade. Smith would be proven right as Piétrus would be a key defender down the stretch during the 2009 NBA Finals run. Piétrus would have some struggles guarding Kobe in the Finals though. With the Magic coming off a Finals loss, they would make some large transactions and would agree to trade Piétrus to the Suns mid-way through the ‘10-’11 season. He would never suit up for them, being waived 4 days later.\n\nPiétrus would sign a minimum contract to finish the season with the Boston Celtics. With the aging “Big 3” and need for wing depth, the Celtics viewed him as a contributor to help guard LeBron. He would appear in all 20 playoff games for the Celtics, providing some valuable moments throughout the playoffs. The moments included were many big shots to keep Celtics in games vs. the 76ers in round 2 of the 2011 Playoffs and some crucial defense vs. the Heat in the Conference Finals.\n\nPiétrus would spend his last year with the Toronto Raptors but would only play in 19 games. He’d finish his career overseas but would leave his mark as a true role player of the game. He does not get all the credit due to him because his time in the NBA wasn’t super long, and he’s been pushed down in the NBA’s memory but I can’t forget him. He was the first international player to wear the Jordan Brand, he was a KILLER in 2K11, a good shooter, and great defender. He did all the dirty work and rarely received credit. He may not have a huge influence on the NBA but players who sort of remind me of him are guys like Josh Hart, Jaden McDaniels, and Jonathan Isaac. All players who can play a bit of point-forward, while also being key defenders and being solid shot makers.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading. I hope you can learn something about some former players who don’t get as much love as the new generation players do. For more follow me here, on Instagram @ballinthepast or on X @34AG12 for more!
