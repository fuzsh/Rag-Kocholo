        "text": "As we enter the second round of the NBA Playoffs, here is a name I bet you probably didn’t expect to hear: Ben Gordon.\n\nWhat does Ben Gordon have to with these playoffs? Nothing and everything.\n\nAs a native Chicagoan, Gordon is one of our forgotten post-MJ heroes. When he bolted from the Windy City, I was certain his talent level would yield success I selfishly hoped would be short-lived. There is nothing worse than seeing a player grow with your hometown team, then leave and have success elsewhere. Yes, Jamal Crawford and Tyson Chandler, Chicago is still wounded.\n\nThe timing of Ben Gordon’s departure is what stung the most.\n\nGordon was drafted in 2004, out of Connecticut, by the Bulls with the third pick overall. He averaged 15.1 points per game in his rookie season, his lowest scoring average in a Bulls uniform. Not too bad.\n\nHe maintained his offensive production through his first four years, but it didn’t necessarily produce wins.\n\nThen in 2008, the Bulls hit the lottery. Literally.\n\nChicago was awarded the overall No. 1 pick. A pick it used to select future NBA MVP, Derrick Rose.\n\nGordon averaged 20.7 points per game that season. Rose averaged 16.8 points and 6.3 assists in his rookie season.\n\nChicago had its backcourt of the future.\n\nThen Gordon left.\n\nHe signed a 5-year, $55 million dollar deal with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe next three years saw a dramatic dip in his offensive production with points per game averages (in order) of 13.8, 11.2 and 12.5. Detroit missed the playoffs all three years.\n\nGordon played less than 80 games just once in his five years as a Bull. He only reached the 80-game mark once in Detroit.\n\nIn the summer after his third year in Detroit, Gordon and a first round pick were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nCharlotte had drafted fellow UConn guard Kemba Walker a year earlier. Walker, like Gordon in 2004, led the Huskies to a national championship in his junior season. Another possible “backcourt of the future” scenario.\n\nAnother failure.\n\nGordon appeared in 75 games his first year as a Bobcat and averaged 11.2 points per game in just under 21 minutes a game.\n\nThis past season, Gordon all but fell into obscurity. He appeared in just 19 games and averaged just over five points.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Bobcats requested waivers on Gordon the day after the deadline for playoff roster eligibility, effectively ending his season.\n\nFrom an NCAA champion, lottery pick and the future of Chicago to a 31-year-old unemployed shooting guard.\n\nAs a lifelong Bulls fan, it was important to me that Ben Gordon showed some type of loyalty to the organization and vice versa.\n\nThe two sides couldn’t agree, and the rest is history.\n\nLance Stephenson is the modern-day Ben Gordon.\n\nHe’s spent four years with the team that drafted him. Needless to say, he’s having the best season of his career in his contract year. He is an integral part of what the Pacers do as a team.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Stephenson will stay or chase the big contract. If he opts to leave Indiana, he could make a name for himself. He could also fall off the face of the basketball landscape, just like a Ben Gordon.\n\nStephenson won’t be the first player to come to this crossroads and he won’t be the last.\n\nWhile everyone is enjoying the 2014 NBA Playoffs and envisioning the superstar of tomorrow, I’m trying to remember the superstar that never will be."
