        "text": "As a participant in a leadership training conference organized by the National Basketball Players Association, Gordon is getting a taste of what it would be like to have an NBA front-office job. It’s much longer hours for far less pay, and from where Gordon sits, the job became infinitely more difficult this summer with the formation of the Miami Superteam. “I think it’s going to change the landscape of the game,” Gordon said. “I think you’re going to see more guys trying to team up, trying to do what those guys did. I think it’s going to ultimately be good for the game. It’s going to put a lot of pressure on teams to get better, and on a lot of players to step their games up. I think in the long run, it’ll have a positive impact.”\n\nJoel Freeland and Ben Gordon have both been ruled out of Great Britain’s squad for this summer’s Eurobasket qualifiers through injury, joining a lengthy list of absentees which already includes Robert Archibald and Andy Betts. Aldershot-born Freeland requires rehab on an injury with his club team Unicaja Malaga as they progressed through the ACB play-offs, before eventually going out at the semi-final stage. The 23-year-old forward has been an integral part of the GB set up which recently topped the EuroBasket Qualifying group in 2008 and competed at last year’s EuroBasket Finals. The British medical team has assessed the NBA first-round draft pick and will provide support to him throughout the summer."
