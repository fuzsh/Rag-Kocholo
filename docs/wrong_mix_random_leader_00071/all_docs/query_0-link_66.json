        "text": "Biography[]\n\nKirk James Hinrich (born January 2, 1981 in Sioux City, Iowa) is an American NBA basketball player, currently starting at point guard for the Chicago Bulls. He is also a member of the USA National Team. Hinrich was exposed to basketball at an early age, due to his father, Jim, being a high school basketball coach in Sioux City, Hinrich's father, coached him from the third grade through high school.\n\nAs a high school senior, Hinrich was named the 1999 Co-Iowa Mr. Basketball, along with future college teammate and roommate, Nick Collison. Hinrich originally committed to play basketball at Iowa State but when the coach at the time Tim Floyd took the head coaching position for the NBA's Chicago Bulls, Hinrich changed his mind and decided to attend the University of Kansas. While playing college basketball for Kansas, Hinrich helped his team reach the Final Four in the NCAA basketball tournament in 2002 and the championship game against the Carmelo Anthony led Syracuse University in 2003. Hinrich played all four years at Kansas before being drafted to the NBA. He got married to Jill Fisher on July 7, 2007.\n\nHinrich is represented by Jeff Austin and Chris Emens of Octagon.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nHinrich began playing basketball seriously in the second grade. His father Jim went to Ray Nacke, his old coach at Briar Cliff College, and asked if Kirk could attend his summer camp. Nacke hesitated at first (the camp was for fourth, fifth and sixth-graders), but the Hinrichs were insistent, Kirk included. After two years Hinrich graduated to the camp for kids in their early teens.\n\nHinrich also played football at the quarterback position, and baseball as a pitcher. Basketball, however, was Hinrich's favorite sport. He modeled himself after Gary Payton having a respect for Payton's commitment to defense, quick hands and feet. When Hinrich entered his freshman year of high school he was already a known commodity partly because of his talent, but also because his father was the team's head coach. Hinrich's high school teams went a combined 82-9 and contended for the state championship every year, with the team winning it in Hinrich's senior year. He scored 25 points in the championship game. Hinrich ended his four years at West High as the school's all-time leader in steals, assists and scoring.\n\nCollege career[]\n\nAs a freshman at Kansas, Hinrich led the team in assists with the single-season sum of 123, which was the fourth most ever by a Kansas freshman. In his sophomore year at Kansas, Hinrich totaled 229 assists, which was the fourth-best single-season mark in Kansas Jayhawk history. He averaged 6.9 assists (8th in nation) and established a school record with a .505 three-point shooting mark, leading the Big 12. Hinrich also led the team in steals.\n\nHinrich was voted onto the \"All-Big 12 Second Team\" (by the Associated Press) and awarded the \" All Third Team\" status (coaches). He was also named to the \"Big 12 All-Improved Team\" and won the \"Clyde Lovellette Most Improved Player Award.\" In his junior year with Kansas, he helped lead the Jayhawks to the Final Four, and was voted onto the \"All-Big 12 Second Team\" (for both coaches and media). He also earned Kansas' \"Ted Owens Defensive Player Award.\" He topped the team in free throw shooting and three-point shooting (also led Big 12 in the latter), while ranking second in assists (5.0 apg), minutes played (30.9 mpg) and third in scoring and steals. In his senior year with the Jayhawks, Hinrich helped Kansas get to the NCAA Championship Game and was named the NCAA Tournament Midwest Region's \"Most Outstanding Player.\" He ranked second on the team in scoring (fourth in the Big 12), led team in three-pointers made, along with 3.5 assists (second on team), 3.9 rebounds and 1.9 steals a game.\n\nNBA career[]\n\n2003 Draft[]\n\nHinrich was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 2003 NBA Draft with the seventh overall pick, resulting in mild surprise because he had been expected a mid to late first round draft pick. Some doubted that his college game would translate successfully to the professional league, in part because he played shooting guard for his final two years in college, but is considered too small to play that position professionally. Hinrich's high selection in the draft is credited to a good workout in front of NBA team scouts. The Chicago Bulls also developed a sudden need for another point guard, as Jay Williams was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. After being picked by the Bulls Hinrich said he knew they had a need at point guard, \"I know Jay we came out of high school the same year. He's a great guy. I feel for him, but the rumors were Chicago was going to take a point guard, so I had a good chance to be drafted. The situation is tough. I know everyone is kind of in mourning about it. But if he's not able to play anymore, which I hope is not the case, they're going to have a need for a point guard.\"\n\n2003-2004 Season[]\n\nHinrich met with misfortune when he suffered an acute viral infection shortly before the beginning of his first season, requiring months to fully recover. However, he played well, showing a continued good grasp of fundamental skills, solid playmaking, leadership, and a surprising defensive intensity. He solidified his position as the Bulls' starting point guard and was named to the NBA's 2004 All-Rookie first team. He held the distinction for being the only rookie during that season to record a triple-double, with 11 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists versus the Golden State Warriors on February 28, 2004. During this same season, Hinrich's shot accuracy inside the three-point line (38.6 percent on field goals) was actually poorer than from behind it (39.0 percent on three-pointers). Hinrich was named to the NBA's \"Got Milk? All-Rookie First Team\" along with Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Bosh. He was also awarded the Bulls' Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award or Player of the Year award (POY) for the 2003-04 season.\n\nHinrich is known for his intense on-court demeanor; he was involved in a minor scuffle between the Bulls and the Washington Wizards in the preseason of his second year in the league, for which he was fined $10,000. On a drive to the basket, then Wizards player Larry Hughes head butted Hinrich out of bounds, which prompted former teammates Antonio Davis and Eddy Curry to get into a small fight with Wizards center Brendan Haywood. Hughes, Haywood, Curry and Davis were all suspended at least one game by the NBA. The Bulls later met the Wizards in the first round of the playoffs and the possible start of a rivalry was born.\n\n2004-2005 Season[]\n\nIn his second year, Hinrich's field goal percentage went up to .397, a marginal improvement. Though he started his second year as the team's starting point guard, he was moved to the shooting guard spot nine games into the season due to the team's 0-9 start. Ben Gordon was moved to the bench, as the Bulls' sixth man. The player who took over the starting point guard spot was rookie Chris Duhon. After this move was made, the Bulls started to gain team chemistry and the starting line up was geared more towards defense, with Gordon coming off the bench to spark the teams' scoring. The Bulls then made a run throughout the rest of the season to finish 47-35, becoming the first team ever to start off 0-9 and reach the playoffs, where they earned the 4th seed in the eastern conference. After winning the first two games of their series with the Washington Wizards, they lost the next four, including a last second loss at home in game 5, and were eliminated. During the off-season (the period of time between seasons) of Hinrich's second year the Bulls exercised the fourth-year option on his contract, meaning he is now signed through the 2006-07 NBA season.\n\n2005-2006 Season[]\n\nIn his third year in the NBA, Hinrich's field-goal percentage went up to 41%, although his three point shooting accuracy fell to 35%. His career free throw shooting average is 80.5%, making him one of the better free throw shooters on the Bulls. The team traded away Antonio Davis and Eddy Curry in the off season and the team struggled until making a late season run to gain the seventh seed in the playoffs where they faced the eventual champs Miami Heat, in the first round. It was in the third game of the series that the Heat's James Posey shoulder tackled Hinrich, as he ran the fastbreak.\n\nHinrich ended the 05-06 season averaging a career high 15.9 ppg (points per game), a team-high 6.4 apg (assists per game), and 3.6 rpg (rebounds per game), while shooting a career high 41.8% from the field and a career high 81.5% from the free throw line. He was the only member of the Chicago Bulls to average more than one steal per game in the 2005-06 campaign.\n\nHinrich received a multi-year contract extension on October 31, 2006, which was the deadline for the deal (otherwise Hinrich would have become a restricted free agent). Bulls GM John Paxson was quoted as saying, \"Kirk Hinrich is imperative to the foundation of our organization and we are extremely pleased to have him with us long term. We are attempting to build a team based on character and commitment and these are both traits that Kirk possesses at a very high level. This is a very good day for the Chicago Bulls organization.\"\n\nHinrich was named to the NBA's All Defensive second team in the 06-07 season. All Defensive teams all selected by the 30 head coaches in the NBA. First team votes are worth two points and second team votes are worth one point. Head coaches can not vote for players on their own team. Hinrich received 7 first team votes and 4 second team votes, for a total of 18 points. Hinrich joined teammate Ben Wallace on the 06-07 All defensive second team.\n\n2006-2007 Season[]\n\nHinrich improved his stats in shooting and scoring during the 06-07 season his fourth in the NBA, with career highs in field goal, 3-point field goal, and free throw shooting percentage, as well as a career high 16.9 ppg average. However, Hinrich's assists average were the lowest of his career, he also grabbed the fewest rebounds per game of his career.\n\nIn a game against the Miami Heat, Dwyane Wade injured his wrist while being defended by Hinrich. Heat coach Pat Riley accused Hinrich of injuring Dwyane Wade's wrist on purpose. \"Hinrich pulled his hand. He does it all the time that's what he does. Anytime Dwyane comes off screens, they will always grab his shirt or grab his hands. It's a tactic down below the body the official can't see it. He had Dwyane's hand, and [when Wade] tried to pull it out of there, I think something happened.\" Hinrich was then played a recording of what Riley said, his response was candid, as he responded by saying \"I can't worry about Pat Riley, I just have to worry about myself, he's going to try and do his job, and I'm going to try and do my job. I can't really comment on what he should be worrying about. It's unfortunate [Wade] got hurt, but I wasn't trying to hurt him. I was chasing him off a screen then there's contact. I don't know if he got tangled up or whatever, and he started grabbing his hand.\" During the game James Posey committed a flagrant foul against the Bulls, this one against Luol Deng.\n\nWhen Hinrich's teammate Ben Gordon heard Riley's comments, he came to his defense stating \"I heard him saying something about Kirk. Posey's was way more blatant. I don't think Kirk did anything. He was just playing aggressive defense. Kirk didn't do anything dirty. I don't appreciate him taking shots at our guys.\" Sports Illustrated columnist Chris Mannix, called Riley's comments \"on the border of hypocrisy\" while maintaining that Hinrich's grab of Wade's wrist while illegal, was not a dirty play. \"For starters, the play itself hardly qualifies as dirty. That was not the word Riley chose, but it was certainly what he insinuated. Illegal, yes. But dirty?\" \"Hinrich had no intention of hurting Wade. He didn't grab his wrist and twist it. He didn't chop down on it with his other hand.\" He went on to describe plays like that commonplace in the NBA, while calling Posey's foul on Hinrich during the 06 playoffs dirty. \"Dirty was the cheap shot that James Posey delivered to Hinrich when he leveled the guard with a body check during last season's playoffs.\" Riley later had a different view on his comments, the next time the Bulls and Heat played Riley was questioned about the comments he made by a reporter. \"I didn't accuse him of anything, I'm going to tell you exactly what I think about him, OK? I think he's one of the top defenders in the game, in the league. He reminds me of Jerry Sloan, he reminds me of Michael Cooper. And just like the Chicago Bulls whined about Dwyane, who was getting too many free throws, a great defender like Kirk Hinrich gets away with more.\" \"He's into you, he's relentless. He has a reputation as a tough defender and he gets away with more.\"\n\nDuring the Bulls first game of the 2007 playoffs against the Miami Heat, Hinrich threw his mouth piece into the stands after being assessed a charging foul. Hinrich received a technical foul for his actions as well as a $25,000 fine. Technically Hinrich should have been ejected from the game but he was allowed to stay in. Bulls coach Scott Skiles was quoted as saying \"What Kirk did the other (day), that's supposed to be an automatic ejection. They didn't see it. Hopefully, nothing like that happens again.\"\n\nThe Bulls went on to sweep the defending champions 4-0.\n\nInternational career[]\n\nIn July 2006, Hinrich was officially named to the United States national basketball team that hopes to compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. He was initially invited to participate in February 2006, but declined due to the pressure of making a decision in the midst of a competitive NBA season with the Chicago Bulls: \"When I initially turned it down, I don't know if I really knew what I was doing,\" Hinrich said. \"It was in the middle of a long season. I was focused on what we were doing. After the season was over, I was thinking that I someday might regret it. To get another chance to reconsider, I feel lucky.\" After his 2005-2006 NBA season ended, Hinrich changed his mind and accepted a spot on the team's roster.\n\nThe roster first fielded more than 20 players and was then cut down to 15 players, among which is Hinrich. The final roster will have 12 players. Hinrich was chosen as one of the 12 players that competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan.\n\nHinrich learned of the death of his grandfather, and left the US training camp in Las Vegas early in the morning of July 25 to return to his hometown of Sioux City. Before leaving Hinrich met with the USA basketball media and commented on traveling overseas with the US national team. \"I'm just really excited to have an opportunity to represent the country and go after a world championship,\" he said. \"That's a big deal. I'm excited to be a part of it. It's really a huge step in my career, and I'm excited to represent my country. It was great to get out here and compete with these guys [the US national team] and get to know them. Slowly we're becoming a team, and it's great to see and great to take part in it.\"\n\nHinrich started the United States' exhibition game against Lithuania, in which he scored 10 points, had 2 steals, and shot 80% from the field in a US win. After the game Hinrich was asked about starting the game, \"We're playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just try to make the best of it, make sure our team is successful. It's one of those deals when you play in groups in spurts like that, it's a little bit tougher. But, you don't hold back and give it everything you got because you know you'll be rested a lot.\"\n\nThe US team played the Greece national team in the FIBA world Championship semi-final, which they lost 101-95. Hinrich connected on a three point shot with 2:41 to play in the game to bring the US within 5 points, but was then called for an unsportsmanlike foul on Greece center Sofoklis Schortsanitis. The US team then played against the Argentine team for the bronze medal in the FIBA World Championship. In this game Hinrich played against NBA teammate Andres Nocioni. The US won the game 96-81, to take the bronze medal in the tournament.\n\n[]\n\nsportsstats.com: Kirk Hinrich Kansas Jayhawks statistics\n\nNBA.com Profile - Kirk Hinrich\n\nProspect Profile for Kirk Hinrich\n\nTransactions[]\n\nStatistics[]\n\nTotals[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2004 CHI 76 66 2706 318 823 .386 144 369 .390 135 168 .804 42 217 259 517 101 21 204 276 915 2005 CHI 77 77 2800 445 1122 .397 145 408 .355 171 216 .792 32 272 304 494 122 21 176 244 1206 2006 CHI 81 81 2955 451 1078 .418 126 341 .370 256 314 .815 29 259 288 514 94 21 188 251 1284 2007 CHI 80 80 2839 475 1061 .448 140 337 .415 237 284 .835 32 242 274 500 100 23 191 274 1327 2008 CHI 75 72 2380 330 797 .414 84 240 .350 118 142 .831 28 216 244 452 87 19 157 224 862 2009 CHI Career\n\nPer Game[]\n\nSeason Team G GS MP FG FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% FT FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK TOV PF PTS 2004 CHI 76 66 35.6 4.2 10.8 .386 1.9 4.9 .390 1.8 2.2 .804 0.6 2.9 3.4 6.8 1.3 0.3 2.7 3.6 12.0 2005 CHI 77 77 36.4 5.8 14.6 .397 1.9 5.3 .355 2.2 2.8 .792 0.4 3.5 3.9 6.4 1.6 0.3 2.3 3.2 15.7 2006 CHI 81 81 36.5 5.6 13.3 .418 1.6 4.2 .370 3.2 3.9 .815 0.4 3.2 3.6 6.3 1.2 0.3 2.3 3.1 15.9 2007 CHI 80 80 35.5 5.9 13.3 .448 1.8 4.2 .415 3.0 3.6 .835 0.4 3.0 3.4 6.3 1.3 0.3 2.4 3.4 16.6 2008 CHI 75 72 31.7 4.4 10.6 .414 1.1 3.2 .350 1.6 1.9 .831 0.4 2.9 3.3 6.0 1.2 0.3 2.1 3.0 11.5 2009 CHI Career\n\nAwards and Accomplishments[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nWeb Directory[]\n\nStatistics[]\n\nNews, Opinion, and Rumors[]"
