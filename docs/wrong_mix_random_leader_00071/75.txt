London-born Detroit Pistons star Ben Gordon scored a season-high 30 points against the Toronto Raptors last night - but his impressive shooting was in vain as his new team lost 110-99.

The 26-year-old, set to pull on a Great Britain jersey next summer, hit two 3-pointers and eight of his free throws, as well as chipping in with four assists.

But Italian Andrea Bargnani and MVP candidate Chris Bosh combined for 48 points to help the Raptors to the win.

Gordon, a former teammate of fellow Brit Luol Deng at the Chicago Bulls, joined the Pistons in the summer signing a five-year, $55m contract.

The shooting guard has started the season in fine form, averaging 25.2 points per game in his first five matches.

The Pistons travel to last seasons NBA finalists Orlando Magic tomorrow, where they will face the 6ft 11in All Star Dwight Howard.

British power forward Pops Mensah-Bonsu, though, could only watch from the bench as his Houston Rockets lost a 103-102 thriller to LA Lakers in overtime. Mensah-Bonsu, who has played a total of just five minutes in his teams opening five games, was powerless as Lakers star Kobe Bryant continued his fine form, scoring 41 points to add to the 31 he scored the previous day.

Andrew Bynum's 17 points and 17 rebounds were similarly critical to the outcome, with Bynum landing the match-winning free throw.

Elsewhere, the Phoenix Suns saw their unbeaten run come to an end after four wins as they crashed 122-100 to the Orlando Magic, for whom Dwight Howard scored 25 points.

The New Jersey Nets were also well beaten, losing 122-94 to the still unbeaten Denver Nuggets in East Rutherford. Ty Lawson led scoring with 23 points for the Nuggets, while Kenyon Martin had 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Nets have now lost five straight at the start of the season.

Other than the Nuggets, only the Boston Celtics are unbeaten so far, and they maintained their winning sequence by defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 92-90.

The Miami Heat won 93-89 against the Washington Wizards, thanks to a 40-point haul from Dwyane Wade, while the New York Knicks slumped 101-89 to the Indiana Pacers.

The Atlanta Hawks landed their fourth win in five games, beating the Sacramento Kings 113-105 with the aid of 26 points each from Joe Johnson and Jamal Crawford. Kevin Martin had a game-high 29 points for the beaten Kings.

Chris Paul grabbed 39 points for the New Orleans Hornets in a 114-107 victory after overtime against the Dallas Mavericks. The Hornets had been heading for defeat but Peja Stojakovic grabbed a three-pointer with 6.7 seconds remaining of regulation time.
