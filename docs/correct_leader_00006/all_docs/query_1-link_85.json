        "text": "The goal of this paper is to briefly describe the relationship of the Croatian and Yugoslav revolutionary and political leader Josip Broz Tito (1892.-1980.) with the Polish people from the beginning of World War I to his death based on works and sources cited. The relationship can be traced primarily in two phases. In the first, Tito comes in contact with the Polish within the Communist Party of Poland (CPP) and the Comintern with the goal of a revolutionary transformation of Europe and the world. That was mostly an illegal thing and it is also how Tito established closer relations with Josip Čižinsky (Milan Gorkić), the Czech-Poland revolutionary and, for a time, the leader of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Apart from Čižinsky, Tito was briefly connected with the Polish Communist of Jewish origins, Henryk Walecki. He was a high-ranking officer of the Comintern and their relations are still insufficiently researched. After World War II, Tito led the diplomatic activity and foreign policy between the communist Yugoslavia and Poland. The relations were highly complex at that time. The reason for that is the fact that Poland was part of the eastern block i.e. the Russian zone of interest. Among the remaining Polish communist leaders, Tito had the most complex relationship with Vladislav Gomulka, a man who strived to become the “Polish Tito” but the reality of forces did not allow for such ambitions\n\nYugoslavia, from 1945 to 1991, the most open and liberal socialist country, was known for its social-political-economic experiment with self-management, for social ownership over the means of production, and for market socialism. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia, although started as a revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist political party, persistently experimented with reducing the role of the party and the state. An academic school of Marxist humanist thought around the philosophical journal Praxis (1964-1975) challenged the speed of that experiment and provided sharp criticism of the party's philosophy and practice, demanding strict adherence to declared principles. When Yugoslavia's role of the \"Third Way\" lost its importance, the system and the country fell apart. As David Riddell characterized the experiment, “Yugoslavia provide[d] a laboratory for research in the possibilities of decentralisation of control in modern large scale societies and its psychological effects” (1968).\n\nMass media have traditionally played a significant role in creating and maintaining romanticized images of political leaders. Josip Broz Tito was particularly successful in maintaining his public image and using it as an anchor for a “united” Yugoslavia, despite many controversies and inconsistencies. After the collapse of Communism and almost thirty years after his death, his personality cult is still preserved in countries of the former Yugoslavia, albeit to a varying extent and utilizing different kinds of discourse. The following paper examines the influence of the media on the creation and maintenance of Tito’s personality cult, via the medium of history textbooks in Serbia and Croatia. It utilizes content analysis of textbook discourse across three time periods: during Tito’s rule, during the conflicts of the 1990s, and in contemporary textbooks, resulting in a systematic comparative study of the evolution of Tito’s personality cult across time and space. The paper additionally compares the evolution of Tito’s image in textbooks to the evolution of the portrayals of Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman, and concludes with research data on how contemporary youth in these countries perceive and understand the meaning of the material on Tito presented in textbooks today.\n\nWhile the research on history revisionism of the Communist era, as well as on the gradual dissolution of Josip Broz Tito’s personality cult along with Yugoslavia’s disintegration in the 1990s has flourished, most of the research assumes that Tito’s image changed in a singular, uniform, and consistent way, along with the new official nationalist agenda of the new post-Yugoslav states. However, the evolution of Tito’s personality cult following his death took place at three distinct levels: 1) the official politics of Communist memory revisionism, usually taking place at the national level (changes in official commemorations, official calendars of public holidays); 2) local government politics (e.g. street renaming, removal or installation of monuments) occurring at the city or municipal level; and 3) grassroots and vernacular memory-making, typically organized by civil society agents (e.g. opposing the appropriation of anti-fascist symbols for nationalist purposes). This chapter examines the ways in which different levels of society – the nation, local municipalities, and civil society – have differently appropriated, rejected, or adapted the ‘official’ dismantling of Tito’s personality cult after 1990. The data collected for this chapter points at the plurality of memory agents operating at different levels of society, with different ideological, political, and personal motivations, and demonstrates that the outcomes of memory-making activities are highly dependent on the local context within which the activities are embedded.\n\n\"Winner of the Croatian Architects' Association's 2012 Neven Šegvić Award in the category of architectural publication, criticism, and theory. Unfinished Modernisations is a collaborative, long-term research platform on architecture and urban planning. It brought together partners from both institutional and non-institutional sectors from South-Eastern Europe: Museum of Architecture and Design, Ljubljana (Slovenia), Maribor Art Gallery (Slovenia), the Croatian Architects’ Association (project coordinator) and Oris House of Architecture, Zagreb (Croatia), the Belgrade Architects Society, Belgrade (Serbia) and the Coalition for Sustainable Development, Skopje (Macedonia). The project was aimed at fostering interdisciplinary research on the production of built environment in its social, political and cultural contexts. It encompassed the countries that succeeded former Yugoslavia, spanning the period from the inception of the socialist state until today. The topic of the researches was the way in which divergent concepts of modernization conditioned architecture, territorial transformations, and urban phenomena in socialist Yugoslavia and its successor states. Special attention is paid to critical re-reading of modernization processes and contextualization of local architectural and urban planning concepts within the framework of international evolution of architectural discourse. Unfinished Modernisations were carried out through a variety of activities: researches, 5 conferences (Zagreb, Skopje, Beograd, Split, Ljubljana), exhibitions, publications, and web-site/blog www.unfinishedmodernisations.net. The keynote speakers at the conferences included David Harvey, Vedran Mimica, Hilde Heynen, Ljiljana Blagojević, Tom Avermaete, Dietmar Steiner, Hans Ibelings, and many others. All these efforts culminated in the final exhibition in Maribor (Slovenia), the 2012 Cultural Capital of Europe. The exhibition was also shown in Belgrade (Serbia), Zadar (Croatia), and Ljubljana (Slovenia), and will travel to various international destinations.\"\n\nThis Thesis is an analysis of Tito’s Yugoslavia, focusing on the sources of stability and instability; it employs International Relations Theory and historical narrative. A major concept that will be utilized is “balance of power” theory, which will illustrate how in Yugoslavia “supranational” stability was achieved by ensuring an “equilibrium of power”. In this Thesis Yugoslavia has to be perceived not as an ordinary, single national state, but more as its own “mini state system”, since the Yugoslav Federation itself was composed of several Republics with their own respective rights and identities.Tito’s approach of assuring stability with his policy of “brotherhood and unity” initially prevented the formation of “destabilizing factors”, in the case of Yugoslavia nationalist tendencies themselves, which constantly threatened his “Pan-Slavic” union.Tito’s methods to preserve his second Yugoslav “experiment” are also visible through major events which shaped Yugoslavia for generations to come, like the “Tito-Stalin Split”, the establishment of a Yugoslav “self-management system” or the “Croatian Spring” movement. Throughout this Thesis it is also shown how Tito tried to ensure a “balance of powers” not only on a national level, but also between the Yugoslav ethnicities themselves, especially through his key ideology of “brotherhood and unity”, which was enforced with a “sticks and carrots” approach - in form of reforms, but also with repressive measures. In order to ensure stability, Tito fiercely persecuted political and cultural dissidents in his Yugoslavia, which were often imprisoned in labour camps (“Goli Otok”). The approach of viewing Yugoslavia as its own state system ultimately allows to grasp how Tito managed to preserve the Yugoslav Federation: on an authoritarian level first and, after his constitutional amendments of 1974, on a “plural” level second."
