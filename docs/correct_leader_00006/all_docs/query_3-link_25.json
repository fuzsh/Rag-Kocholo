He became the youngest Sergeant-Major in the Austro-Hungarian Army after distinguishing himself in World War I, but he was captured by the Imperial Russian Army. In 1917, he took part in the Russian Revolution after the Red Army liberated him from prison in the Urals, and he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia on his return to Yugoslavia."
