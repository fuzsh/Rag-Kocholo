        "meta_description": "<p><strong>Josip Broz Tito  1892 - 1980</strong></p>\n\t<p>Throughout his long life, Josip Broz Tito was known as a man of stubborn courage, ready to fight and intrigue, endure hardship and risk death for his beliefs. He was proud, strong-willed, unbending before an opponent, ruthless to an enemy – and a bit vain.</p>\n<p>\tThe peasant’s son and wartime guerilla leader who was to become President relished power. Tito lived like a monarch but he proclaimed, to his last days, that Communism was his goal for Yugoslavia.</p>\n\t<p>Tito’s pride put him in conflict with Stalin when the Kremlin leader attempted to dominate postwar Yugoslavia. The outcome was a historic rift in Communism in 1948. Adrift between East and West, Tito worked with other third-world leaders in the 1950’s to develop the movement of “nonalignment” and he was to stay at its forefront.  <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/topics/tito-obit.pdf\">Read the complete obituary >></a></p>",
