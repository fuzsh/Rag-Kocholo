        "text": "Mr. President:\n\nI take great pleasure in welcoming you to the United States. I hope during this visit we can reciprocate some of the hospitality that you have shown to members of the United States Government, both members of the Cabinet and most recently Members of the Congress, in your own country.\n\nThis is a difficult and dangerous world in which we live. I think it is most important that we have--across the distance of water and across perhaps a difference in political philosophy--that we have an understanding of the basic policies and objectives of the countries through the globe so that danger may be lessened.\n\nWe are very glad to have you here, Mr. President, so that you can see something of the United States. I am glad you are going to the South and then to the West. This is a vigorous and progressive people that you will see. Nature has been very generous to us, and I think that your visit here, where I am sure you will be warmly and hospitably treated and welcomed, will give you a greater understanding of the policies and objectives and meaning of the United States of America.\n\nSo this visit is very welcome. We are very glad to have you here at the White House, and I hope as a result of your visit that the relations between our two peoples will become stronger and that our commitments to national independence will be strengthened.\n\nSo, Mr. President, we are very glad to welcome you and your distinguished wife, the members of your government, here to the White House."
