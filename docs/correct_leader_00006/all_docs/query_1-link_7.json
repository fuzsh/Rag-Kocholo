B. Tito, and the President of the Royal Government, Dr. Ivan Subasic. The Regency Council take their oath to the King, while the Government take their oath to the people.\n\nThe President of the National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, and the President of the Royal Yugoslav Government, Dr. Subasic, with the full concurrence of the Anti-Fascist Council of Liberation of Yugoslavia, agree that the Govern ment be formed as follows:\n\n1.\n\nPresident;\n\n2.\n\nVice-President;\n\n3.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs;\n\n4.\n\nMinister of the Interior;\n\n5.\n\nMinister of National Defense;\n\n6.\n\nMinister of Justice;\n\n7.\n\nMinister of Education;\n\n8.\n\nMinister of Finance;\n\n9.\n\nMinister of Trade and Industry;\n\n10.\n\nMinister of Communications;\n\n11.\n\nMinister of Post, Telegraphs and Telephones;\n\n12.\n\nMinister of Forests;\n\n13.\n\nMinister of Mines;\n\n14.\n\nMinister of Agriculture;\n\n15.\n\nMinister of Social Welfare;\n\n16.\n\nMinister of National Health;\n\n17.\n\nMinister of Public Works;\n\n18.\n\nMinister of Reconstruction;\n\n19.\n\nMinister of Food;\n\n20.\n\nMinister of Information;\n\n21.\n\nMinister for Colonization;\n\n22.\n\nMinister for the Constituent Assembly;\n\n23.\n\nMinister of State for Serbia;\n\n24.\n\nMinister of State for Croatia;\n\n25.\n\nMinister of State for Slovenia;\n\n26.\n\nMinister of State for Montenegro;\n\n27.\n\nMinister of State for Macedonia;\n\n28.\n\nMinister of State for Bosnia and Hercegovina.\n\nThis form of government in Yugoslavia shall remain in force up to the decision of the Constituent Assembly, i. e., until the final constitutional organization of the State will be established.\n\nThe new Government will publish a declaration proclaiming the fundamental principles of the democratic liberties and guaranteeing their application. Personal freedom, freedom from fear, freedom of worship, liberty of conscience, freedom of speech, liberty of the press, freedom of assembly and association, will be specially emphasized and guaranteed; and, in the same way, the right of property and private initiative. The sovereignty of the national individualities within the State and their equal rights will be respected and safeguarded, as [Page 253] decided at the Second Session of the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia. Any predominance of one nation over another will be excluded.\n\nThe President of the Royal Yugoslav Government:\n\nDr. Ivan Subasic\n\nThe President of the National Committee of Liberation of Yugoslavia:\n\nJ. B. Tito\n\n[Enclosure 2]\n\nElections for the Constituent Assembly and Organization of Public Powers\n\n1. Elections for the Constituent Assembly will be decided upon within three months of the liberation of the whole country. The elections will be held in accordance with the Law on Elections for the Constituent Assembly which will be enacted in good time. This law will guarantee complete freedom of elections, freedom of assembly and speech, liberty of the press, franchise for all and a secret ballot, as well as the right of independent or united political parties, corporations, groups and individuals—who have not collaborated with the enemy—to present lists of candidates for the election. All those whose collaboration with the enemy will have been proved, will be deprived of both the right to elect and to be elected.\n\n2. The Anti-Fascist Council of the National Liberation of Yugoslavia will wield the legislative power until the Constituent Assembly will have completed its task.\n\n3. The Government will be responsible for the organization of the executive power.\n\n4. One of the first and foremost tasks of the new Government will be to organize the judiciary power in the country in a democratic spirit. The Courts of Justice will be independent in their proceedings and the judges will decide according to the law and to their conscience.\n\nJ. B. Tito\n\nDr. Ivan Subasic\n\n[Enclosure 4]\n\nCommuniqué\n\nIn the course of the negotiations which have taken place in Belgrade between the President of the National Liberation Committee of Yugoslavia, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, and the Prime Minister of the Royal Yugoslav Government, Dr. Ivan Subasic, before and after Dr. Subasic’s visit to Moscow, and completed on December 7, 1944, both the question of the formation of a single Yugoslav Government and the question of the transitional regime of the Yugoslav State, pending the decisions of the Constituent Assembly, have been exhaustively discussed.\n\nAt that occasion, it was decided that a single Yugoslav Government be formed, consisting of representatives of all nations and federal units of Yugoslavia and including individuals of various political opinions supporting the fundamental aspirations of the national liberation struggle. This Government would be expected, as early as may be, to establish civic authorities in the country, to proceed to economic reconstruction, and to prepare and carry out elections to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nDecisions were also taken making it possible for the nations of Yugoslavia to express, in these elections, their true will in full freedom.\n\nDuring the talks, Marshal Tito and Dr. Subasic discussed the provisional regime to be set up in the transitional period before the elections, bearing in mind the achievements in the struggle for national liberation, conditions and feelings throughout the country, as well as the international status of Yugoslavia among the United Nations."
