        "text": "Peking University, Dec. 5: On the afternoon of Dec. 2, a seminar on multi-party system and the disaggregation of former Yugoslavia was held in the North Wing Hall of Peking University (PKU) Library. Li Manchang, former ambassador to Republic of Montenegro, delivered an address on invitation. The seminar was hosted by Vice Minister of Student Affairs Department Zha Jing, and teachers and students from different faculties were present.\n\nAmbassador Li Manchang delivered a lecture\n\nAmbassador Li Manchang graduated from Beijing Foreign Studies University and later studied abroad in University of Belgrade in former Yugoslavia. He used to work as the head of Yugoslavia Section of the Department of European-Central Asian Affairs Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the counselor of China's embassy in Yugoslavia, the consul general of Chinaâs consulate in Podgorica and the ambassador to Republic of Montenegro. Therefore, he has a rather deep understanding of the historical background and development of former Yugoslavia.\n\nDuring the seminar, Dean Li Manchang first introduced the history of Yugoslavians in the south Europe since 12th century and the rapid development of the economy of Yugoslavia in the Tito period and analyzed the reasons. Subsequently, he talked about the process of the disaggregation of former Yugoslavia.\n\nDean Li Manchang pointed out that many scholars thought it was the complicated contradictions between ethnic groups that led to the disaggregation of former Yugoslavia, but it wasnât true. In the Tito period, former Yugoslavia also faced these problems but they werenât intensified. However, after the death of Josip Broz Tito, under the pressure from the western countries, former Yugoslavia introduced multi-party system hastily, and other parties took office and agitated national emotions, and thus intensified national conflicts, which resulted in the disaggregation of former Yugoslavia. Dean Li Manchang summarized the experience we can get from the disaggregation of former Yugoslavia and emphasized that only if a country carries out the political system most suitable to its own situation, can it develop rapidly and steadily. In the final Q&A section, Dean Li Manchang answered questions from students patiently.\n\nThe seminar was held successfully and students present said through the seminar, they learned and thought a lot about their historical responsibilities and wished to contribute to our countryâs development one day."
