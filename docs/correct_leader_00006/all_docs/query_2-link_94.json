        "text": "The greatest military secret of the former Yugoslavia Tito`s bunker is located under the mountain Zlatar, 280 meters underground. This atomic shelter could withstand a nuclear attack of 20 kilotons. There are eight alternative exits that are not shown on the map and lead to the top of the mountain. This huge facility has more than one hundred rooms in a total area of 6400 square meters.\n\nBunker is built to protect Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, his family and the closest associates from political and state leadership of former Yugoslavia, 350 of them in a case of nuclear attack. These officials could stay in the bunker for six months without any contact with the\n\noutside world. An important place in the bunker is Tito’s luxurious private residence with six rooms, including his office and a bedroom.\n\nThis is the story of one of the largest and bestkept secrets and the most expensive structures in the former Yugoslavia . The bunker remained a state secret until after the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1992. Guided tours for general public became available only in 2011, when Ministry of Defense of B&H, in presence of NATO, proclaimed that the object had no military perspective, everything moved by the idea of contemporary art project called “Biennial D-0 ARK Underground” which was implemented for the first time and proclaimed as cultural event of Eurpe by Council od Europe."
