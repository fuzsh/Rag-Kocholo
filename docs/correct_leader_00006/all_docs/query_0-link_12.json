        "text": "WHO WAS JOSIP BROZ TITO?\n\nWhat made Josip Broz Tito stand out in comparison to the other communist leaders around the globe, is his famous dispute with the Joseph Stalin. Soon after the war, in 1948, Tito refused many of the Soviet Union’s ideas on economical and political structures. He abended the so-called eastern block and removed the iron curtain on Yugoslavia by implementing his own socialist program, know today as Titoism, which contained elements of market socialism.\n\nMoreover, Tito wasn’t popular just within Yugoslavia’s borders. Internationally, he was seen as a unifying figure not just for maintaining a peaceful coexistence of the numerous Slavic nations under one flag, but also as one of the funders of the so-called Non-Aligned Movement. Interestingly, this forum of 120 developing countries that are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc still exists today. It was formed back in 1961 in Belgrade as a third options for those nations who didn’t feel the need to take sides in the growing Cold War.\n\nAfter a long reign, Tito died in Ljubljana on May 4th 1980 and was buried in Belgrade a few days later. His funeral was attended by four kings, 31 presidents, six princes, 22 prime ministers and 47 ministers of foreign affairs from 128 different countries, making it the largest state funeral in history to that date.\n\nKUMROVEC\n\nLet’s start at the beginning. Tito was born in 1892 in Kumrovec, a tiny village in the bucolic region of Hrvatsko Zagorje in northern Croatia. His home, where he lived with his Croatian father, Slovene mother and seven siblings is now turned into a pretty museum, which also displays ethnographical peculiarities of the region.\n\nKumrovec makes a nice day trip from Zagreb, the capital of Croatia and can be combined with outer tourist attractions in the region, such is the the fairly-tale castle of Veliki tabor. Also worth mentioning – the region Hrvatsko Zagorje is a land of thermal spas. There are numerus resorts on both sides of the border where you can spend a few days to relax and recharge.\n\nVILA BLED\n\nThe picturesque Alpine town of Bled is on a must-see list for everyone who decides to travel to Slovenia. Even Josip Broz Tito was taken by the charming beauty of this glacial lake with a tiny island in the middle. He liked it so much that he turned one of the villas on the lake’s shore into his residence. Among the famous guests sleeping in Vila Bled are North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Il Sung, Czechoslovakian president Václav Havel, the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary Otto von Habsburg, prince Charles, Spanish king Juan Carlos, Paul McCartney, Scottie Pippen and many others. You too can join the list, since this gorgeous villa is now a hotel. Alternatively, you can visit its restaurant and enjoy a lunch with spectacular views once only reserved for VIPs.\n\nTHE BRIJUNI ISLANDS\n\nOut of all his estates, the one on Brijuni Islands just off the shore of Istria, was Tito’s absolute favorite. He spent nearly 6 months of every year here, welcoming distinguished guests from all over the world. It wasn’t just the world leaders, such were Fidel Castro and Indira Gandhi that got his invitation; Tito also entertained celebrates like Sofia Loren, Elisabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.\n\nDuring the long years of his reign, he received numerous quite exotic gifts, including animals such as zebras, waterbuck and Somali sheep. Some of them are still alive and can be visited in the safari park on the islands. Those who died (of natural causes) were stuffed and put on display in on of the surrounding buildings.\n\nTITO’S NUCLEAR BUNEKR\n\nLike every true dictator of the 20th century, Josip Broz Tito also had his own bunker where he could hide in case of a nuclear attack. The complex was built in secrecy between 1953 and 1979 and its existence was only reviled to the general public after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. It was designed to function as a center of military operations and a shelter for both the staff of more than 350 people, along with Tito’s family and close associates.\n\nIf your travelling to Bosnia and Herzegovina, you can visit the bunker located near the town of Konjic, approximately hallway between Sarajevo and Mostar. Visitors are now allowed to peek into several areas which include conference and so-called situation rooms, offices and private rooms.\n\nVILA MILOČER\n\nTito and his wife Jovanka loved glamour, which is more than evident in the numerous residences they had all over the country. Unfortunately, most of them didn’t stand the test of time and are now infamously perishing. Well, Vila Miločer on the Montenegrin coast is not one of them. Built in 1930s for the Yugoslav royal family, this amazing estate was nationalized after the war alongside with all other property belonging to the Karađorđević dynasty. Tito and Jovanka visited quite often and even organized a New Year’s party here in 1973.\n\nToday, Miločer is part of the upscale Aman hotel complex in Sveti Stefan and is very popular with everyone looking to spend luxury holidays in Montenegro. Intrigued?\n\nSTATUES OF TITO\n\nJosip Broz Tito wouldn’t be a true dictator without numerous statues to accompany the cult of his personality. Arguably the most famous one is the bronze depiction created by Antun Augustinčić back in 1943. The rather grandiose sculptures was reproduced numerous times and can now be found all over the territory of ex-Yugoslavia and beyond. Nobody knows exactly how many castings exist, but there are at least twenty and new ones are still being produced.\n\nThe first statute to be casted is now located at his birthplace in Kumrovec. Another copy can be – of course – found at his mausoleum in Belgrade. You can admire others in the Slovenia’s mining town Velenje, at the museums in Sarajevo and Jajce (BiH), a high school in Skopje, a city park in Pogorica, and many others.\n\nTITO’S CARS\n\nTito owned many luxurious cars which today bare a great historical value. 15 of them are part of the permanent exhibition at the Technical Museum of Slovenia, located in the picturesque Carthusian monastery of Bistra, just a few kilometers from the capital. If you are a fan of old cars and interested in Yugoslav history, you should really consider taking a half-day trip from Ljubljana to admire these beauties in person.\n\nThe collection includes rare examples of prestigious limousines, some of which were presented to Tito by famous political figures of the 20th century. For example, there’s a 1937 Packard, a gift by USSR leader Stalin, while his successor Nikita Khrushchev presented Tito with two ZIS in 1954. There’s also a 1952 Rolls-Royce, 1939 Mercedes 540K and many others.\n\nGALEB, TITO’S OFFICIAL YACHT\n\nGaleb, meaning seagull, was an iconic ship used by marshal Tito on his numerus political missions from 1952 to his death in 1980. During that period he hosted numerous statesmen and celebrities on board, including Kirk Douglas, Sophia Loren, Ethiopian Emperor Haille Selassie, Egyptian president Nasser, USSR Secretary Generals Khrushchev and Brezhnev, Winston Churchill and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFollowing the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the yacht was brought to a verge of existence. Luckily, the port town of Rijeka has decided to completely renovate it and turn Galeb into a museum. The project was funded as part of the European Capital of Culture 2020 program and is expected to be opened in 2021.\n\nHOUSE OF FLOWERS\n\nJosip Broz Tito died in 1980 in a hospital in Ljubljana, due to problems cause by gangrene-induced infection. Later his body was transported to Belgrade, then capital of Yugoslavia, where it was interred in a mausoleum also known as House of Flowers. Today it is part of a memorial complex in the grounds of the Museum of Yugoslav History and easily makes a shortlist of must-see attractions for everyone visiting Belgrade. His grave is still frequently visited by the so-called yugo-nostalgics from all ex-member states, who came here to pay their respect and reflect on the times long gone. In the adjacent museum you can take a look at the exhibition on the so-called Day of Youth, once a popular holiday celebrated through the country on May 25."
