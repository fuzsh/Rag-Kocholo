"The Sure Shot (Intro)"

Woo, yo, everybody, let me hear you say

"Yo, a-Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot"

(What?) "And it's like that" (What? What?)

A-Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot, and it's like that

A-Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot, and it's like that

That's the shit

(Gang Starr has got to be the sure shot, and it's like that)

That's the shit

Yeah, you know what fuckin' time it is

Gang Starr duelin' again, rulin' again, watch as we do it again

"Lights Out"

(feat. M.O.P)

Yeah

Gang Starr, M.O.P.

Either ride or be quiet

What we gon' do? (Gon' do), motherfucker

Lights out, I told y'all, this is the one I owe y'all

When you see me, act like you know I know y'all

No one (No one) but Allah can hold y'all

Average motherfuckers can't even handle what I throw y'all

Lights out, I told y'all, this is the one I owe y'all

When you see me, act like you know I know y'all

No one (No one) but Allah can hold y'all

Average motherfuckers can't even handle what I throw y'all (Yo, yo)

Yo, ever since a shorty I was hard-headed and angry

And mad complex and wouldn't let nobody change me

I'm still the same me, gettin' pussy, stayin' weeded

These bitches are starstruck, so **** the way they gettin' treated

I don't need it, if her head ain't right I pass on it

While you trick sucka niggas be wastin' cash on it

And you don't want it, when the fight starts, you always runnin'

Against me, son, you know the outcome, ya always done

Rhymes jog ya mental like ya pop dukes smacked ya

You need to join SAG (Why?) 'cause you're a hell of an actor (Hahahaha)

After you notice what happened it'll be too late

Can't blame no one but yourself for mistakes you make

And some of y'all niggas are like circus monkeys

Livin' life like worthless junkies

Plottin' against your fellow man, helpin' out the devil's plan

Damn, why can't I trust my own people?

**** it, enemies must perish in the valley of their own evil

Lights out, I told y'all, this is the one I owe y'all

When you see me, act like you know I know y'all

No one (No one) but Allah can hold y'all

Average motherfuckers can't even handle what I throw y'all

Lights out, I told y'all, this is the one I owe y'all

When you see me, act like you know I know y'all

No one (No one) but Allah can hold y'all

Average motherfuckers can't even handle what I throw y'all (Yo)

Yo, a wise man once said, "**** what a wise man said"

Bitch, gimme that bag otherwise y'all dead

Clap on (Blaow, blaow), I can ride right now

Leave you paralyzed from your eyebrows down

I got two parts of my brain, **** your life on my right

Ain't nothin' left on my left, ain't nothin' right

(I pull up) The kid scope 'em out, I'll thrush ya

For the bread I'll leave ya head smokin' like a muffler

Sick bars, bitch, what up?

I spit SARS, you spit nut up

Bitch, shut up, it's in my bone marrow

Marked for death, I don't even trust my own shadow

When they can't touch who you become

They'll try to dig up who you used to be (Ahh)

Tell them niggas get used to me (Come on)

You can't go back and change the beginnin'

But I'ma start where I'm at and change the endin'

Lights out, I told y'all, this is the one I owe y'all

When you see me, act like you know I know y'all

No one (No one) but Allah can hold y'all

Average motherfuckers can't even handle what I throw y'all

Lights out, I told y'all, this is the one I owe y'all

When you see me, act like you know I know y'all

No one (No one) but Allah can hold y'all

Average motherfuckers can't even handle what I throw y'all

I do it like I do it 'cause it ain't about the music

Ain't about gettin' through it 'cause I'm already proven

You niggas see me cruisin', nigga, I will lose it

I get on my bully shit, **** up a nigga movin'

Now **** who ya crew is, **** what the true is

Gang Starr forever, **** what the new is

Lil' nigga turned diamonds to ruins

Ball with your RuPaul influence

Shorty askin', "Who you is?"

Forgettin' I'm praised where a few is

Overlookin' OG engraved on the Buick

Before they let me out the cage for the music

I helped you niggas see exactly who John Woo is (Woo)

Now, nigga, who you is? You overpaid, bitch-made, glitch-made

You headin' for the roof when ya shit fade (Hahaha)

With no substance, ho shit by the abundance

Your catalog sound the same, you got one hit

Lights out (Lights out)

"Bad Name"

I hate tellin' good people bad news

I hate, I hate

I hate tellin' good people bad news

Word To God if Big and Pac were still here

Some of these weirdos wouldn't act so cavalier

We all know that the game has changed

It's crazy out here rap's got a bad name

Think about it, what if bling never happened

And the true artist's were gettin' rich from rappin'?

Word to God sum'n should give

Let's delete the politics so real Hip Hop can live

Beef is what's up now, careers are gettin' shut down

The media wants something meaty

People are fuckin' greedy

Music and culture's like a foreign language

You'd be better off staging a fake beef in Spanglish

Compadre, can you handle the whole weight?

Adios mios watch 'em swallow your whole plate

You used to support your fam offa this

Now you can't even buy Spam offa this

And I don't deal with swine

I ain't Dr. Phil, I truly help you heal your mind

Nowadays it's like everybody's losin' it

Instead of them preserving this gift they're all abusing it

It's mad drama, they want us reachin' with the Limas

Causin' hysteria, the new Hip Hop criteria

And they forgot about the blood, sweat and tears

Now we see the results of all the blunts, chicks and beers

Word To God if Big and Pac were still here

Some of these weirdos wouldn't act so cavalier

We all know that the game has changed

It's crazy out here rap's got a bad name

Think about it, want if bling never happened

And the true artist's were gettin' rich from rappin'?

Word to God sum'n should give

Let's delete the politics so real Hip Hop can live

I hate tellin' good people bad news

I hate, I hate tellin' good people bad news

I hate tellin' good people bad news

"Hit Man"

(feat. Q-Tip)

The hit man

Power is so greedy

That's for real

Ain't about a whole lotta talk

It's about, bringin' figures

He got the eye and the heart to do it, yeah

From the roof, with the scoped, there's a whole lot to it

Ain't no emotion when he pulls the trigger

Breathe second of silence, then you see what he do to niggas

Pistols, rifles, grenades, whatever

He's a killin' machine, bought and paid for on pleasure

And way iller than the last nigga

Smoke a nigga in the club, and then dance right past niggas

Once in a while, there'll be one who'll stand out

Who's more than psycho, who'll take any man out

With a certian passion for sendin' bullets blastin'

A certain fashion to the way this nigga wax 'em

And this assassin gets mad satisfaction from puttin' all this worthless scum out of action

I sense some pride in his skill

Looks in the mirror and salutes before he rides for the kill

You got the bag, pop? I got the thing, thing

It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring

With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Or I do it lawn mower style, rrt

You got the bag, pop? I got the thing, thing

It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring

I got potatoes and the mufflers in the whole thing

With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Buckin' at niggas wigs while he's puffin' on cigs

Lay him down, then he bounce out of town to another gig

It ain't nothin', he don't need many friends

Funded different type of weapons, he got plenty of them

If you pass him on the street, or see him in his spot

He's always calm, cool, collected, very rarely is he not

Hit man, with ice in his veins

Does the job so precise, they up the price with his name

Shadowy figure, never too loose with the lip

.44 long in his clip, deuce-deuce on his hip

Baby nine in his boots and his trunk is full

This niggas on some shit and can't be fucked with, fool

In the grimy world of highly-paid hustlers

First they get goons to muscle ya, then get him to touch ya

You wouldn't wanna get in his way, nor his associates

Or a tombstone bearin' your name would be appropriate

You got the bag, pop? I got the thing, thing

It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring

With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Or I do it lawn mower style, rrt

You got the bag, pop? I got the thing, thing

It's in the sling, here it is, let me let it ring

I got potatoes and the mufflers in the whole thing

With the doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

"What's Real"

(feat. Group Home & Royce da 5'9")

What's real?

("The real question is...") What's real?

("Try your best to diagnose...") What's real

("People all around, you got to recognize and witness")

I got soldiers that'll turn shit out, burn shit out

Do I come correctly when it's my turn? No doubt

I twisted trees in the cold with one hand wipin' my nose

Girls say that I'm fly 'cause they be likin' my clothes

But the clothes or the money can't make the man

When I apply my vicious grip, you can't take it, man

Face it and understand, there are no winnings for you

What I'm beginnin' to do, is bring an endin' to you and your crew

I sip a brew and at the same time drink the life out of you

I righteously come through, created in the likeness of who?

G-O-D, can sell a half a line for a G

Check ballistics, you won't be takin' mine from me

Oh boy, you p-noid, heard my lightnin' and thunder

Not Thor but frightening, type of stress I've been under

I'm the one-eyed Jack, I'm here to smack you back

In '83, I seen stacks, run your kicks, take a flick and act

(What's real?) Certified street poetry

In the game a long time, so you know it's me, nigga

(What's real?) Gang Starr, muthafucka, we live

All you fake niggas run and hide, we wanna know

(What's real?) It's Lil Dap in the place to be

We livin' proof, supa star, you see, we wanna know

(What's real?) The Foundation, yo, we presidential

Y'all ain't built for what we been through

Underground, I might as well record in the sewer

Notorious lord of the war, tourin' Aruba

Before I was crawlin' I'd warn you and show you the Ruger

I'ma shoot four through your fedora, destroy your medulla

I could get these niggas X'd, quick as sendin' a text

For disrespect, shit'll be simple as orderin' an Uber

I don't know what's quicker to change, them figures or fame

But I guarantee you don't nothin' move more than the moolah

All these rappers really cut out to do is squash the beef and dip

Y'all need to cut out the diva shit

Every time a nigga like Fever Nina come out the dealership

The streets hear the sound of that Preem droppin' the needle skip

Like Kane walkin' in "The Symphony"

Abel is my brother who all he offers is infamy

I bust Magnums, either strategize or duck faster

I send his whole group home like Melachi the Nutcracker

Preem blowin' weed, he a master on the courts

I'm a student with the rap that's spewin' passion on the chorus

While the smoke is in the air, feel like voodoo's on the floor

'Cause we got the actual ashes of Guru on the boards

He's sittin' right inside an urn in the session

Lookin' down from Heaven to Gang Starr's current regression

Earnin' successes, his legacy get treated like four themes

Movin' forward then let his children eat off the proceeds

(What's real?) Certified street poetry

In the game a long time, so you know it's me, nigga

(What's real?) Gang Starr, muthafucka, we live

All you fake niggas run and hide, we wanna know

(What's real?) It's Lil Dap in the place to be

We livin' proof, supa star, you see, we wanna know

(What's real?) The Foundation, yo, we presidential

Y'all ain't built for what we been through

(What's real?)

("Gang Starr, boy, and that's beyond your comprehension")

"From A Distance"

(feat. Jeru the Damaja)

It's King Equality with lines cocked back to add on

Word to everything, that's what I put that on

Yo, I sat on the sidelines, watched you foolish men

Fake hooligans, now it's time for us to duel again

Yeah, it's me, takin' you savages to school again

I rule again, women are preparin' my food again

I'm like the imperial bandit, stackin' my loot again

Ancient warrior, street fighter, contemporary

Intelligent comrade, enemies I've been sent to bury

You see me at seminars, clubs and bars

I own this shit, rollin' with gangsters, thugs with scars

You see me from a distance, tryin' to analyze the righteous

Caught a scandal and a crisis from this vandalous psychic

Government name Keith Elam, put in work per diem

Still a fly-ass nigga, a magnetic human being

B-A-L-D-head to the Slick, I'm wettin' 'em quick

("You are now rockin' with the best")

("Gang Starr")

("The God Universal Ruler Universal")

("I came to give you exactly what you asked for here")

("You are now rockin' with the best")

("Gang Starr")

("The God Universal Ruler Universal")

("Doin' a whole lot up in these streets")

Well, it's the Justice Equality Ruler Universal

Carefree, sun see, light speed react nuclear thermal

Three-hundred-sixty degrees, we comin' full circle

Open the portal, now you witness God's immortal verbals

Shinin' light infinitely like the cosmosis

Modern science would define this rhyme as osmosis

Go through your faction or sect, we're laser beam focused

You see, if rap was a crime, we'd be on Wanted posters

Keith, we kinda like the team that killed the White Lotus

My feet firm in the ground and Guru on my shoulders

Deep concentration is the formulation at begin

Poison pen, maestro chop the violin

I try to stop but my mind keep firin'

Try to advance, you hear them ambulance sirens

You ain't get it? Here's the summation

Nigga, **** what you heard, it's Gang Starr Foundation

("You are now rockin' with the best")

("Gang Starr")

("The God Universal Ruler Universal")

("I came to give you exactly what you asked for here")

("You are now rockin' with the best")

("Gang Starr")

("The God Universal Ruler Universal")

("Doin' a whole lot up in these streets")

"Family And Loyalty"

(feat. J. Cole)

Like a freshly cut diamond

Like a freshly cut diamond

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

Word up, diamonds

(Like a freshly cut diamond)

Diamonds are forever like friends that'll kill for you

Went up in a jewelry store, burglary, steal for you

Bill with you, split the diamond into ice blue

Thrice he tried to disrespect our kinship, I don't like you

And now you axed out the fam'

But I'm cashin' checks, with Premier on this jam

Robin Leach, interviews on the beach

When we shake hands, nothin' but ice on the reach, and I teach

Like the Rap Reverend Ike without the perm', I preach

There's more you need to learn, I return for my streets

Gainin' my wealth, trainin' myself

For corny confrontation with haters who be playin' themselves

Diamonds, I like my world of rap

Your rhymin', hah, it's like a world of crap

And a diamond is like a fly-ass girl that's strapped

And you can't beat that with a bat

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought (Yeah)

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

Word up, diamonds

Diamonds (Diamonds), diamonds (Diamonds), yeah

Pick up the pen, write down a sin, it's cleanse

Lay that shit down, play it for friends

Make a few M's, then do it again

J. Cole, who'd've thought you would've been rhymin' with Ghost

Guru flows forever like a diamond

The most could never afford the precious jewels

That's precisely why I'm blessin' you with clear-cut messages

I'm destined to invest in urban sections where depression rules

I hope to heal the destitute before I leave this vestibule

Between the heavens and the seven circles

Where some dead homies maybe rest, I plan to resurrect a few

I press the truth against the neck of devils

Look at the youth just like a precious pebble

Meant to be protected, mentally we let this

Poison of Western philosophy make us sloppy

We forgot we are the chosen

From hip-hop to astronomy, they copy what we showed them

Niggas be talkin' slick, but only try me over modems

In person they starstruck, they hearts flutter

I'm like the realest one you ever met

If you don't feel this one, give it a sec'

Go live a little, let the years pass

Experience pain, watch the tears crash on to the floor

Hurt brings wisdom

Wisdom brings a whole 'nother sort of understandin'

Diamonds only worth what we demandin', uh, uh

And niggas payin' top-dollar

Once upon a time I paid a 100 for mine, now I'm a lot smarter

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

I rock diamonds that cut glass out of window panes

Baldhead Slick blazing tracks when the indo's flame

Rocks that bling, rocks that make them jock my team

Rocks that shine, rocks that keep my hand on my nine

Rocks that blind, make the High Rocks drop down

One of a kind, niggas best jet from the spot when I cock mine

Diamonds are like your man you always call fam'

Diamonds are like your grandma you always call ma'am

Diamonds are like having the whole world in your hand

Diamonds are like the shows I ripped with no band

Rockin' your knot, stoppin' your plot

It's me, Baldhead Slick Duke, coppin' your block

For you it's only pain, for me it's only gain

Diamonds are like loyalty, iced out like royalty

Diamonds are like my wifey, so sweet the way she spoils me

(So good)

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty

Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought

Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

Word up, diamonds

(Like a freshly cut diamond)

"Get Together"

(feat. Ne-Yo & Nitty Scott)

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-c'mon, uh-c'mon

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-c'mon, uh-c'mon

Uh-cuh-cuh-cuh, cuh-cuh-c'mon, cuh-c'mon

C'mon, c'mon

All or nothing, while I'm in this

C'mon, c'mon

It's me El Grande, or call me Papi Chulito

Yo tengo mucho lovin' for you mamis if you legal

For honeys, nothing equal to the way I tap that spot

Get your cat hot, guess what? You hit the jackpot

Candle-light dinners for you winners, huh

See like I'm like Don Juan, hit me sweetie, I get in ya

Sugar, I'mma put y'a in a beautiful mood

Forget about that lame, he ain't a suitable dude

Word up, I'm the one you like to talk to

You'll find my conversation so enlightening that you sparkle

Hoy ya ven aquí, so I can hold you tight, mold you right

Listen girl, I got more game than Dolemite

It's only right, baby, that we blend together

You'll be wanting me to be your friend forever

And ain't it clever boo, how I got you sprung?

So when I holler yo, you know you gotta come

Dame little mami, ven aquí

(Dame, dame, dame, dame)

I'm sorry, that's as far as my Spanish goes

Several words, like "si"

Because I like what I see (I like what I see, yeah)

I was thinkin' we should get together on the low

You and me

What that chulo? You lookin' at my kulo?

Said you got that prosciutto, but I won't call you my boo though

I'm too cool yo, they call me la negrita for real

And it's really nice to meet you, heard you like a big deal

So what it do? You checkin' for me twice in a blue

Shit I spit too, bet I'm probably nicer than you

I mean let's talk about it

Start with a G through the park and have a walk about it

Like what's your favorite color?

Why you wanna be my lover? Tell me, how's ya' mother?

Could you meet me up town when I'm thinkin' of ya'

No time for another sucker, let him ring the buzzer

I'm sippin' honey, dippin' sundress in the summer

Jiggy mami right, droppin' niggas like mics

Plus I've never been the type to fall in love with the hype

Eatin' my rice, hit 'em with the dímelo papi

Got a thing for baggin' bapis in my beef & broccoli, what

Dame little mami, ven aquí

(Dame, dame, dame, dame)

I'm sorry, that's as far as my Spanish goes

Several words, like "si"

Because I like what I see (I like what I see, yeah)

I was thinkin' we should get together on the low

You and me

(Uh, uh-c'mon)

Let's get together baby, ah, ah

Let's get together baby, ah, ah

Let's get together baby, ah, ah, ah

Oh, ah, ah, yeah

Let's get together baby, ah, ah

Let's get together baby, ah-ah-ah-ah

Let's get together baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

(Uh, uh, uh-c'mon)

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Oh, oh

(Uh, uh-c'mon, uh-c'mon)

"So Many Rappers"

So many rappers have come and gone

I guess this rap game has really done them wrong

So many rappers tryin' to get their name out

Many got caught up for just havin' their chain out

So many rappers couldn't handle showbiz

While I'm steady rockin', so you know what it is

So many rappers made this their dream

Then quickly, most have disappeared from the scene

So many one-hit wonders, it's like a spin of the wheel

You know I stay consistent and get it in for real

So many rappers wanna rock like this

But they got no stamina and they don't talk like this

Plus I've learned to avoid the traps

I truly love this shit, that's word to MTV Raps

They'll get their little run and have a little fun

Some'll go for popularity, to a little, then to none

Some'll get jacked 'cause they floss too much

Others'll leave the game 'cause they lost too much

Some got bodied before they were totally on

It's like when keepin' it real goes totally wrong

Some get beat by managers, and shiesty execs

Others are brainwashed by their unlikely success

Well, I have proven time and time again

That I'm built to last, so watch me shine again

So many rappers have come and gone

I guess this rap game has really done them wrong

So many rappers tryin' to get their name out

Many got caught up for just havin' their chain out

So many rappers couldn't handle showbiz

While I'm steady rockin', so you know what it is

So many rappers made this their dream

Then quickly, most have disappeared from the scene

Many had major deals, big money and all that

On 106 & Park, in magazines and all that

So many had all that, so how did they fall flat?

That's why my motto has always been to just fall back

And watch the whole circus go by, I'm that guy

As soon as I appear on the scene, nigga, it's shy

So many pranksters with so many gimmicks

Wonder where they're at now, probably somewhere lookin' timid

It's all madness, there's too many to count

Everybody and their mom wanna rap, no doubt

Many come out with a bang, and their own new slang

Then end up back in the hood without a goddamn thing

Some make noise, they hit the top of the charts

Still, the shit that I kick will be stoppin' they hearts

So many rappers in search of fame

And most'll be lucky if we remember their names

"Business Or Art"

(feat. Talib Kweli)

(Business)

(Art)

All he had to do was just enjoy the ride

Get on my level (Business)

A Gang Starr with a gangster, on a mission

We come and infiltrate your whole cypher man (Art)

Business or art? Fist or steel?

Industry or street? Fake or real?

Cold or hot? Truth or trash?

War or peace? Longevity or cash?

Here's one for SPIN, Billboard, and Rolling Stone

Hip Hop is so organic, it'll grow on its own

We watch 'em throw money at it with clout and power

But after a while, things faded out and went sour

Somebody lost their shirt, execs got fired

Some artist went berserk, took mad drugs and got wired

Hundreds of thousands, up to millions in promo

All wasted on garbage, now, that was a no-no

Oh no, what's gonna happen now to these fools?

These self-centered pricks were showered, proud of 'em too

Never that, 'cause I am the renegade realist

Street visionary, the end of days idealist

People often ask what's the key to longevity

How I'm so consistent and bring the heat incredibly

Intelligence is vital and always stay hood

'Cause this is our culture, and we need to make good

Business or art? Fist or steel?

Industry or street? Fake or real?

Cold or hot? Truth or trash?

War or peace? Longevity or cash?

Business or art? Let's pick it apart

If you ain't spittin' out your heart, you'd be considered a mark

The bullshit gotta stop, 'cause when it's business o'clock

You hear the tickin' and the tockin' on the digital watch

Yeah, time is money, and they don't find it funny

They'll show up where you live, make your environment bloody, buddy

They'll kick in the door, tell you "Get on the floor"

They bust a .9 and bust some rhymes, you like, "gimme some more"

Askin' you where your heart is, but you an artist

You was never as hard as you said you was

Maybe lyin', wasn't the smartest decision you ever made

'Cause this business ain't regulated

If you beefin' over beats in these streets, you'll never make it

Now you singin' to cops, that's your favorite tune, nigga

They ain't got Yelp reviews for goons, nigga

Hip-hop, homie, that's our lane

It's Gang Starr with the Black Star gang

We bang-bang when it's business or art

Business or art? Fist or steel?

Industry or street? Fake or real?

Cold or hot? Truth or trash?

War or peace? Longevity or cash?

(Business)

(Art)

All he had to do was just enjoy the ride

G-G-Get on my level (Business)

A Gang Starr with a gangster, on a mission

We come and infiltrate your whole cypher man (Art)

"Take Flight (Militia, Pt. 4)"

(feat. Big Shug & Freddie Foxxx)

("It's the real...")

("Conversatin' like some raw pimps sportin' the minks")

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("You know and I know")

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("Nigga better bang")

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("Then I'm runnin' through the spot")

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("However it's gon' go, it's gon' be that")

One in the spiritual, three in the physical

OG soul like Smokey and the Miracles

Grimy and lyrical—you want it? Here it go

We be in spots where bitch niggas fear to go

Abrasive, still smack faces

Grab you by your neck, smash your head in the basement

Godly, still controllin' the square

You the competition? Get the **** outta here

We got the safeties and the locks off just in case it jump off

Count to three, only these niggas dump off

For the love of hip-hop, what's it worth?

For the pain of hip-hop, we bringin' the hurt

Fake niggas, we put in the dirt

Silly rap nigga wearin' a skirt

We unbeatable, don't even try

**** around, lay around, do or die

It's the militia

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("However it's gon' go, it's gon' be that")

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("It's the militia") ("It's the real")

Let's see if you can rap and step with this production

I never left, plus I kept me somethin'

That I could use on these MC's that kept frontin'

They watched me unload and explode, I kept dumpin'

The Black Bruno, with the Mack uno uno

Crush you like a Black sumo, I'm back, you know

The man of the hour, I'm the man of the year

Make room and understand I'm here

Hell, my clientele is the most regal

I crush brain cells, my name rings bells to most people

You broke the rules, so I'ma have to get at you

Pussy, you're pitiful, your crew can catch a clip or two

Always the swiftest, you, watch the way I lift his jewels

He's woozy, excuse me while I rip this dude

I light a Dutch while you get touched with ease

And your chick steady fallin' in love with me

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("However it's gon' go, it's gon' be that")

Rhymes take flight, gods get tight, it's serious

("It's the militia")

Raw

Yo, it's the gang Gang Starr across my chest

On Gu' and them, I never let Solar rest

Me robbin' them rappers that's braggin'

The pain is of Attica stabbin' you

Leakin' from holes you didn't know you was havin'

Bitch niggas take flight when Bump pick up the mic

I write what rappers wanna be like in real life

Then spit your favorite song with verses crazy long

'Cause I do what the **** I want on every song

And you bitches are mad 'cause you spit a facade

For sad niggas who thought hip-hop was really gone

But not for very long, I'm back to carry on

Like I'm Marshawn Lynch, runnin' through every song

Wack rappers, take a knee, all races

In any race, Freddie Foxxx put that ox to they faces

And **** your music is the basis

'Cause my shit hard, rip to the gods, say it, militia
