Mike Stern - Instructional guitar video

4.25 GB | DVD | 704x480 25 fps 4553 Kbs | 01:06:54

Grammy-nominated jazz guitarist Mike Stern has been in the public eye (and ears) since he was a member of the Miles Davis Band in the early '80s. His prolific performances and recordings have earned him recognition as one of the best and most popular contemporary guitarists today. This, his first instructional video, includes four live performances by Mike and his band at the 55 Bar in New York City, the historical club in which Mike has played for over 15 years, accompanied by many great musicians, including Jaco Pastorius. Additionally, in an exclusive interview with New York-based jazz guitarist Satoshi Inoue, Stern offers his own analysis and explanation of each tune. The songs - a blues, a standard, a ballad, and a funk tune - were carefully selected by Mike himself in order to demonstrate every aspect of his guitar performance and techniques. He also gives insight into his background, influences and practice routines, and provides a thorough review of his gear configurations.
