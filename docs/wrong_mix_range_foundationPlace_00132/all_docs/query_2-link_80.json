The days are shorter, and the beauty of summer and fall has faded away. Death seems to have taken its grip on the natural world... for a time. But from death comes life, in the natural world as well as in the spiritual world. The Bible tells us, \"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord\" Romans 6:23. Winter, the second part of the God So Loved the World series, reaches into the darkness of sin and its impact on our world. But praise God, it doesn't end there! God had a plan from the very beginning. Listen as His plan is revealed in the discussions and music of Winter. God has promised us eternal life through Jesus Christ, Who will take our sins and make us \"whiter than snow.\"\n\nContents\n\n1. My Redeemer\n\n2. I Know Whom I Have Believed\n\n3.

We spend more time outdoors, energized by warmth of the sun, taking it all in. The Bible tells us of a “Christian summer”, when there will be no more sin and suffering and we will enjoy endless days in the presence of our Creator. Summer,the fourth and final part of the God So Loved The World series, focuses on the Biblical themes of the second coming, the resurrection of the dead, facing our life’s record, the millenium, and the promise of eternal life with our Saviour and Friend, Jesus. As you listen to the music and the stories, filmed in the beauty and warmth of summer, it is our prayer that your own heart will be warmed by promises of God.\n\nContents\n\n1.
