        "text": "a ove slatke ribice sto se jadaju jel imo neko to iskustvo\n\nGood day my dearest,\n\nI want to thank you for your reply to my mail although we have not known each other before, i am very happy seeing your reply, how are you doing today, hope your doing good. I am alright only that life has not been easy for me, moreover my name is Miss Bena Jones, i am 25 years but age does not matter in a relationship, age is only but a number rather what matters is true love and caring, i am never married and i do not have any kid, i am a student but currently not schooling now because of my present condition, i am from Sudan by Nationality but i am currently residing in a refugee camp located in Senegal here in west Africa, my late parents are Dr. and Mrs Jones Paul. My father Dr. Jones Paul,was the Special Adviser to President Salva Kiir of South Sudan for Decentralization. My parents were among with other top Military Officials and top Government officials that was on board when the plane crash that took place on Friday 02, May 2008 on their way to a Political Conference, i lost my lovely parents which was the worst thing that has ever happened to me in life.\n\nAfter the burial of my late parents life becomes so difficult for me as the only child to my parents, my uncle conspired and sold my father's properties to a Chinese Expatriate, and my uncle left nothing for me to survive with, explaining to me that it as how tradition demands, as a female issue i don't have any right to my father's properties, i tried to fight for my right but he threaten to kill me sothat is the reason i find my way and run away from my country, i am residing in the refugee camp here in Dakar Senegal, although life is not easy here.\n\nLife is so difficult for me here because i do not have any relative who can help me but I thank God for providing pastor of Christ the king church located at the camp, he is the pastor that takes care of the refugees and i send and receive your mails from his office, his name is (Reverend Pastor Peter Anthony), he is just like a father to me as i became close to him during one of his visitation to the clinic when i was sick. You can call me whenever you want to speak with me with his number ( 00221773497937 ) so that i can talk with you because i have already told him about you, when you call please tell him that you want to speak with me so that he can send for me from the females hostel to talk with you. i will be so glad to speak with you, please try to call me on the reverend father's phone number above so that i can hear your voice.\n\nMy dear there is something i would like to discuss with you, please it's a secret and no one knows about it, i need you to assist me due to my refugee status here in Senegal. I believe that you are a gentle and Godly person that is why i wanted to share this secret with you and i will like you to be sincere and trustworthy to me. i know we have not meet before but i believe we can be together in the near future, Before the death of my father in 2008, he deposited a sum of ($6.6 million) (Six million six hundred thousand dollar) in leading bank in Europe which my name appears as the next of kin because i am the only daughter of my parents, when my parents were alive they never hide anything from me as the only child, after the death of my parent i was able to get my late father's Statement of Account were he Deposited his money, my uncle later got to know about it, that was the reason he was threatening to kill me so that he can be able to claim the money. So i will like you to help me transfer this money to your account and from it you can send some money for me to get my traveling documents and air ticket to come over to meet with you. i cannot transfer the fund by myself due to my refugee status, refugees in Senegal does not have any right or freedom to do anything here in Senegal so i need your help so that i can get my late father's fund transferred to your care to enable me have my freedom and come to your country if possible for a better life with you.\n\nAlready i have informed the bank about my plans to claim this money but the bank told me to look for a foreign partner who will assist me in the claim due to my refugee status here in Senegal. As a refugee i don't have a direct claim over the money but can only have it through an appointed representative. So in the light of above i will like you to keep it to yourself and don't tell it to anyone because i am afraid of losing my life and the money if people gets to know about it. Remember i am giving you all this information due to the trust i have deposed in you. I like honest and understanding people,truthful and a person of vision, truth and hardworking which i believe you are. Please my dear i will like to know your willingness to assist me in this claim so that i can give you the full contact of the bank in Europe for you to contact them for verification and confirmation.\n\nI have kept this secret, even Reverend Pastor Peter Anthony does not know about it, but i will tell him as soon i get someone that could be able to help me out and i also want you to keep it to yourself too for i am afraid of loosing my life or the money. Dear i want to go back to the hostel in few minutes from now we are going to have our manual labor, i will give you the information of the bank in my next mail after seeing your reply, once again thank you and God bless you for your kind help to me. i awaits for your reply. here are my photos.\n\nYours in heart Bena\n\ndokle bre vise a u p\n\n[FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]Hello,[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri, sans-serif]I am in receipt of your email and I also thank you for the provided information about your property.

My name is Dr. Ali Mustapha; I am a secret military medical Doctor in Syria working with the British charity on one year humanitarian program in secret hospital in Syria led by Late Dr Isa Abdur Rahman. I contacted you primarily in confidence hoping that you can be a trustworthy person and would also be helpful in a matter like this. l will definitely buy your car, because I will be in your country soon to live and have peace of mind after my contract is over here.\n\nI want to let you know that Syria now is not safe any more for doctors. Our Location are all secret after the army bombarded some hospitals, including the AL-Shrea hospital where I work that was shelled three times and finally destroyed. Most Syrian doctors asked not to be identified for fear of retribution from the authorities. Going to a state hospital is no longer an option for many people. The army controls the main hospitals, which I believe are filled with Syrian security personnel. I saw wounded fighters arrive at one of these public hospitals and got beaten and arrested before being treated. Lives are in danger here including mine, but I don't have much option as this is my duty. I have to help.\n\nOn the order hand, I have $2.2 million dollars which was given to me by my late Friend Dr Isa Abdur Rahman, A Syrian British doctor who died some few months ago in an attack on a field hospital where he was treating civilians.\n\nDr Isa Abdur Rahman's father serves Dr Rifaat Al-Assad, younger brother of the former President of Syria, Hafez Assad but now in exile in U.K because he is not in support of President Bashar Al-Assad, who inherited harsh dictatorship from his father who refused to embrace peace and bring reformation to his country.\n\nMy Friend died in a bomb shell by the Syrian government forces while he was on duty trying to save innocent people. Before he died he entrusted this money to me, which was given to him by his late Father who made it through oil deals with his commander when he was serving the military and I wish to use this money for charity and investment purpose in Europe and that is the reason I contacted you because I want to leave Syria very soon. If you accept my proposal I will make you the beneficiary of the funds and transfer it to you through a diplomatic delivery services where a diplomat will be the one to carry out the delivery of the cargo to you using his diplomatic immunity. All I just need is your acceptance to receive this fund which would be in form of a cargo. You will act as the beneficiary in Europe, who will receive the cargo and keep it safe till I come over.\n\nI cannot transfer this fund through bank because banks are controlled by government forces which make it impossible; secondly because of the sanction imposed on the country by United Nations bank transfer would be impossible.\n\nPlease if you are interested in this transaction Kindly get back to me and I will give to you the complete details you need for us to carry out this transaction successfully. I decided to find someone that is real and not imaginary and that is why I went to a secured property site where I can be sure that the person I would be dealing with is real and I believe I can trust you. Where I am now we can only communicate through the Red Cross communication facilities which only permit me sending Emails. Be rest assured that our deal is safe, so If you are interested in this transaction I will send you all the complete details you will need for us to carry out this transaction. At the very moment I have opportunity to send the money out of Syria with help of ECHO European Commission for humanitarian services working under the Red Cross ECHO that brings relief materials from Europe, North America and other parts of the world to our location in Syria. I want to use this unique opportunity move out the funds as cargo so that after my contact is over I will come to Europe to live.\n\nI await your fast response so we can start this process. In less than one week the money should have been noted on your care, and then I will give you further details upon hearing from you. You will take 20% of the funds which is 440,000 USD for your help after I must have paid for your car and you hold 80% of the remaining sum in a safe place till I come, I hope I am being fair on this deal.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDr. Ali Mustafa"
