        "text": "1)Banovina Hrvatska je proglasena tek 1939 godine dogovorom Cvetkovic-Macek kada su demokrate i HSS formirali vladu, uz blagoslov namesnika kneza Pavla\n\nNETACNO - VIDI DOLE\n\n2)Integralno jugoslovenstvo nema veze sa srbizacijom\n\nNETACNO - VIDI DOLE\n\nKraljeva diktatura je izbila kao odgovor na krizu parlamentarizma\n\nNETACNO - VIDI DOLE\n\nTa pljacka i ubijanje Hrvata je cista laz, produkovana iz ustaske kuhinje\n\nNETACNO - VIDI DOLE\n\n3)...su videli resenje u ustaskom pokretu koji im je prodavao pricu o ugnjetavanju Srba\n\nNETACNO - VIDI DOLE\n\n1. Banovina Hrvatska:\n\nU Hrvatskoj ban je bio državni poglavar u predfeudalno doba, kraljevski namjesnik u ranom srednjem vijeku, poglavar Kraljevine Hrvatske, Slavonije i Dalmacije s ovlastima potkralja do kraja I. svjetskog rata, starješina banovina u Kraljevini SHS te poglavar Banovine Hrvatske od 1938. do 1941.\n\nStari posvojni pridjev banj očuvao se tek u pokojem toponimu, npr. u Banjoj Luci (znači banova livada. Dojčin Petar, varadinski ban, rumunjski (vlaški) kralj, poznata ispičutura, opjevana i u narodnoj pjesmi (Vino pije Dojčin Petre, varadinski ban).\n\nHrvatska Banija / Banovina nastala je dvojako: ili dodavanjem nastavka -ija osnovnoj riječi, što označuje područje pod upravom crkvenog ili svjetovnog upravitelja (biskup — biskupija, župan — županija, ban — banija) ili dodavanjem nastavka -ina posvojnom pridjevu (kraljev — kraljevina, carev — carevina, banov — banovina) u istom značenju: administrativno-teritorijalne jedinice kao napr. Banat?\n\n2. Jugoslavenstvo i Srbizacija koristeci banovine\n\nBanovine Kraljevine Jugoslavije, uspostavljene 1929. godine, doslovno su izbjegavale etničke, vjerske ili historijske granice, što je dovelo do podjele većine jugoslavenskih etničkih grupa u nekoliko banovina, uključujući i Hrvate. Takvom podjelom, Srbi su bili većinski narod u šest, od ukupno devet banovina. Vodeći borbu sa unitarističkom politikom Kraljevine Jugoslavije, hrvatski političari su se uspjeli izboriti za autonomiju nove etničke banovine. 1939. godine, Savska i Primorska banovina su u cjelosti, zajedno sa manjim dijelovima Vrbaske, Zetske, Drinske i Dunavske banovine su pripojene novooformljenoj Banovini Hrvatskoj. Do stavaranja Banovine Hrvatske je došlo potpisivanjem Sporazuma Cvetković-Maček koji je, između ostalog, predviđao rješavanje tzv. \"hrvatskog pitanja\", odnosno težnje mnogih hrvatskih političara i pokreta (kao npr. ustaša) izdvajanju Hrvatske iz Kraljevine Jugoslavije.\n\n3. Kraljeva diktatura\n\nhttp://www.mtsmondo.com/izbori2008/parlamentarizam.php\n\nDa je početkom 20. veka parlamentarni život u Srbiji bio podjednako loš kao u poslednjih 15 godina potvrdjuju arhivski podaci o ubistvima, progonu i zabrani rada političkih neistomišljenika, što je, tridesetih godina, krunisano uvodjenjem otvorene dikature u kojoj je svaki politički angažman bio zabranjen.\n\nPolitički život pre Drugog svetskog rata u Jugoslaviji, stvorenoj na nacionalnim idejama Vuka Karadžića, Jerneja Kopitara, Dositeja Obradovića i Ljudevita Gaja o zajedničkoj državi koja garantuje slobodu i nacionalni identitet, obeležila je formalna parlamentarna demokratija koja je kasnije zakonski prevedena u otvorenu diktaturu. Kralj Aleksandar Karadordjević je od dolaska na vlast tretirao parlament samo kao paravan za sprovodjenje sopstvene političke volje - zabranjivao je rad političkim neistomišljenicima, hapsio ih i ubijao, dok na kraju nije uveo Šestojanuarsku diktaturu.\n\nTa je diktatura uvedena po načelu vladavine „po milosti Božijoj“. Odredjena je i načelom da je kralj veličanstvo, a narod podanik. To je posve suprotno načelu parlamentarne monarhije, gdje je narod veličanstvo, a kralj nije ništa drugo nego organ naroda i države... Cilj (kralja Aleksandra) je osloboditi se svake kontrole i postati samodršcem.\n\n4. Ideja Jugoslavenstva\n\nJugoslovenski odbor u Parizu, čiji je predsednik bio političar iz Dalmacije Ante Trumbić, a članovi Nikola Stojanović, Frano Supilo i Ivan Meštrović. Uticaj Odbora u Austrougarskoj nije bio veliki jer se nalazio u emigraciji, ali je prihvatio, uz izvesna neslaganja, Srbiju i Crnu Goru kao vodje oslobodjenja i ujedinjenja. Dve godine kasnije, Jugoslovenski odbor i srpska vlada potpisali su Krfsku deklaraciju, koja je precizirala težnje jugoslovenskih naroda ali ujedno i bila neka vrsta kompromisa – Odbor je prihvatio vladavinu dinastije Karadordjević u Jugoslaviji kao ustavnoj monarhiji, a srpska vlada izbore za ustavotvornu skupštinu i dvotrećinsku većinu za donošenje ustava.\n\nU Zagrebu je u oktobru 1918. godine osnovano Narodno vijeće predstavnika Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca iz Austrougarske, koje je postalo treći faktor u stvaranju zajedničke države, pored Jugoslovenskog odbora i srpske vlade. Narodno vijeće je 19. oktobra odbacilo ponudu cara Karla Habzburškog o formiranju trijalističke države. Hrvatski sabor je deset dana kasnije raskinuo državnopravne odnose sa Kraljevinom Ugarskom i Carevinom Austrijom. U Ženevi je 9. novembra usvojena Deklaracija o ujedinjenju Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca u nedeljivu državnu celinu, a državno uredjenje je ostavljeno za ustavotvornu skupštinu. U Novom Sadu je 25. novembra skupština donela odluku o priključenju Kraljevini Srbiji, a dan kasnije u Podgorici, na Velikoj narodnoj skupštini srpskog naroda Crne Gore, doneta je odluka o ujedinjenju sa Kraljevinom Srbijom pod vodjstvom dinastije Karadjordjević. Konačno, 1. decembra 1918. godine, u prisustvu predstavnika svih jugoslovenskih naroda i regenta Aleksandra Karadjordjevića, formirana je Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca.\n\n5. Pljacka i Ubijanje Hrvata, alternative Velikoj Srbiji i razlozi za ustastvo\n\nSam si kontradiktoran prvo tvrdeci da je to izmisljotina a onda da je kralj ubijao sve narode. Da li zelis reci da su Hrvati bili postedjeni i imali specijalni status milosti?\n\nTokom diktature su bile policija je progonila ilegalne radikalne grupe kao što su hrvatski i makedonski nacionalisti, albanski i crnogorski separatisti i komunisti, protiv kojih je već 1920. bila donesena Obznana. Na ulici je u Zagrebu ubijen hrvatski nacionalista Milan Šuflai, što je dovelo do međunarodne peticije koju su potpisali i Albert Ajnštajn i Hajnrih Man.[traži se izvor] Oko 400 članova KPJ i SKOJ-a ubijeno je u periodu od 1929. do 1932. Ovako velikim žrtvama pridonijela je direktiva vodstva KPJ za pripremu oružanog ustanka, podstaknuta procenom Šestog kongresa Kominterne o približavanju opšte krize kapitalizma. Vladko Maček je u decembru 1929. uhapšen i dugo držan u zatvoru, ali je pušten bez optužbe. Potpredsednik HSS-a Josip Predavac uhapšen je zbog sloma Seljačke zadružne banke i osuđen na 2 i po godine zatvora. Maček u svojim Memoarima tvrdi da je propast banke zapravo izazvala država, koja je preko Jugoslavenske narodne banke kontrolisala banskarski sistem. Kasnije, u julu 1933, Predavec je ubijen.\n\nSvetozar Pribićević je prvo interniran u Brus (Srbija), a zatim mu je dopušteno da napusti zemlju[traži se izvor]. Umro je u Čehoslovačkoj 1936. U emigraciju odlaze HSS-ovi prvaci Juraj Krnjević i August Košutić, kao i radikalni nacionalisti Ante Pavelić (poslanik Narodne skupštine iz redova Hrvatskog bloka), Gustav Perčec, Branimir Jelić idr.\n\nHrvatski su političari još 1919. godine uručili zahtjev Kongresu primirja, u Parizu, za samoodređenje hrvatskoga naroda, kojeg je podpisalo 157 tisuća Hrvata, a godine 1922. hrvatski su narodni zastupnici poslali predstavku Društvu Naroda u Ženevi, tumačeći položaj hrvatskoga naroda u novoj državi i nikada nisu dobili odgovor, kao da Hrvatska ne postoji. Isto tako je 1923. godine hrvatski vođa Stjepan Radić, uime narodnih zastupnika, tražio u Parizu, Londonu i Moskvi, pomoć za Hrvatsku, koja je svaki dan sve više živjela u ropstvu i nasilju.\n\nGodine 1929. i 1930., u odnosu na događaje u jugoslavenskoj Skupštini, hrvatski su zastupnici bezuspješno molili Društvo Naroda za samoodređenje. Osobno su narodni zastupnici: dr. Juraj Krnjević (1895.-1988.), ing. August Košutić (1893.-1964.) i dr. A. Pavelić posjetili Društvo Naroda i tražili da Hrvatska dobije pravo na samoodređenje.\n\nTada je narodni zastupnik dr. Ante Pavelić,videći da se ne uvažavaju hrvatski zahtjevi, najavio prevratnički ustanak i odbio svaku odgovornost hrvatskoga naroda za njegovu oružanu i prevratničku borbu za slobodu, što će se sigurno dogoditi, jer smatra da hrvatski narod ima pravo na svoju državu.\n\nPropašću jugoslavenske države, godine 1941., za Hrvatsku je bio pravi trenutak da ona proglasi svoju nezavisnost. Od Hrvata se ništa drugo nije moglo očekivati a najmanje da brane državu koja im je oduzela sve sastavnice državnosti, sprečavala gospodarstvo i kulturu, zatvarala, mučila i ubijala istaknute Hrvate i njihove političke vođe. Jugoslavija je bila ugnjetavač hrvatskoga naroda, a Hrvati su se osjecali kao robovima u toj državi. Posve je jasno da je hrvatski narod iskoristio prigodu za ostvariti svoju nezavisnost, a da to nije bilo poistovjećivanje ni s talijanskimfašizmom a ni njemačkim nacionalsocijalizmom.\n\nDa. Uvek su uzimali ulogu pomiritelja, oslobodilaca, zalagali se prevazilazenja razlika itd. Umesto da se strogo sledi svoj nacionalni interes, bez trunke respekta ka okolnim slabijim narodima, uvek se tezilo nekom zajednishtvu, miru&harmoniji u okruzenju gde svi drugi reze na tebe....\n\nFor example, Croatian peasants had to pay more kinds of taxes at higher rates than under the Habsburgs. Some taxes increased as much as eight hundred percent in comparison to the pre-1918 period. For example, the peasant had to pay tax on his home-made wine regardless if he sold it or had it only of his own use. The control over the tobacco production was so strict that persons had to pay fines, endure beatings, and even jail terms for smoking their own home- grown tobacco. Taxation easily turned into a national issue because a peasant in Croatia paid four times higher taxes than a peasant in Serbia. Even his vote was worth less than that of a citizen in Serbia. For example, the number of voters needed to elect a parliamentary representative were: Vojvodina 3,221; Montenegro 4,350; Serbia and Macedonia 5,657; Croatia and Slavonia 6,840; Bosnia and Herzegovina 7,478, and in Dalmatia (southern Croatia) 8,106 3 The peasant was especially offended by registration, stamping, and military mobilization of all large domestic animals (horses, mules, oxen). Most of the time, such animals and their owners were forced to participate in military maneuvers for long periods of time and quite often during planting or harvest seasons. These and similar pressures resulted in numerous peasant rebellions against the new regime in several parts of Croatia.\n\nOne source states that in the five years of 1929 to 1934, that is, from King Aleksandar's assumption of dictatorial powers until his assassination in Marseilles, the following court sentences were imposed on the Croats for political \"crimes\" 5:\n\n19 were condemned to death by hanging\n\n16 were killed while serving a prison term\n\n30 death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment\n\n85 condemned to death but fled the country\n\n146 were condemned to 20 years of hard labor\n\n484 received penalties from 10 to 20 years jail terms\n\n962 were condemned from 5 to 10 years\n\n2,035 condemned from 1 to 5 years\n\n15,000 condemned from one month to one year of prison\n\nThe evidence presented in the Appendix to this article, although partial and collected from secondary sources, strongly indicates the nature of the Yugoslav state and its predisposition toward the Croatian people. It includes over 4,700 cases that can be summarized in the following way.\n\nKillings and imprisonments\n\n231 killed by gendarmes and/or military forces\n\n102 wounded\n\n3,715 arrested\n\n49 killed while in jail\n\n40 condemned to death - out of that 22 executed\n\n16 sentenced to life imprisonment\n\n250 tried for verbal insult of the King's name\n\n14 condemned in absence\n\nBeatings\n\n642 beaten and maltreated - out of which 27 children 48 groups of people maltreated and beaten (individual names not known)\n\nOther persecutions\n\n493 lost jobs or forced to retire 26 newspapers and organizations banned\n\nWomen\n\n7 killed\n\n42 arrested\n\n48 beaten and maltreated\n\nSocial and/or professional categories (if known)\n\n1,445 peasants either jailed, tried and/or maltreated\n\n472 students\n\n450 workers\n\n153 professionals\n\n117 craftsmen and small business owners\n\n68 state office holders\n\n39 soldiers or policemen\n\nAccording to regions (if known)\n\n3,176 Northern Croatia\n\n791 Dalmatia\n\n355 Lika and the Littoral\n\n203 Slavonija and Srijem\n\n169 Bosnia and Herzegovina (the primary focus of this study was the Republic of Croatia and not Bosnia and Herzegovina)\n\nNumber of Cases according to years\n\n1918 - 155\n\n1919 - 36\n\n1920 - 92\n\n1921 - 209\n\n1922 - 5\n\n1923 - 60\n\n1924 - 5\n\n1925 - 705\n\n1926 - 1\n\n1927 - 8\n\n1928 - 60\n\n1929 - 110\n\n1930 - 107\n\n1931 - 205\n\n1932 - 671\n\n1933 - 1,529\n\n1934 - 312\n\n1935 - 466\n\nThe above numbers and categories clearly indicate that the harshness of the persecutions was directed against Croats, regardless of profession, age, gender, or place, and that the intensity of the persecutions reflects the political \"moods\" in the country at the time.\n\nPlatili Bjalburgom? Vi ustashe chovechanstvu nikada necete moci dovoljno platiti..... u tom istorijsko-kulturoloshkom smislu.\n\nZa najvece etnichko chishcenje na ovim postorima i za hiljade ubijenih civila, istorija ce suditi vama.... A nemoj sad opet da kopiram shta su svetski velikani rekli o vama\n\nBecause the guardians of the state were guided by their hatred of real or imaginary enemies, they implemented a vast variety of tortures against their victims. The purposes of torture were not only to break the spirit of the victims and to send a message to others, but in many cases to show by sadistic measures, their absolute disdain for the \"enemy.\"\n\nA common practice for gendarmes was to burst into a village and for a minor incident, or even for no reason at all, beat anyone they encountered, destroy property, and jail people without any legal stipulations. In order to humiliate a Croatian peasant, gendarmes would often force him to genuflect three times in reverence for the Serbian traditional military cap (sajkaca) and impel him to acknowledge that \"the Serb was his master and god.\" It was also a common practice for the police to beat or even execute their victims in broad daylight on a city street. Verbal insults, swearing vulgarities, and blaspheming everything holy to the Croatians were a common practice. The gun-butt was a favorite weapon in beating the common people. Its use was so prevalent that one of the Ministers of the Interior was nicknamed \"Kundak\" (gun-butt).\n\nThose who ended up in prison endured all sorts of humiliations and tortures, from being cursed to being tortured to death. The following were some of the more common means of torturing political prisoners: merciless beatings over the entire body especially the kidney area; pounding the soles till they crack; knocking out teeth, breaking ribs, finger joints, and other bones of the body; jumping on the stomach and groin; sticking needles under nails; crushing testes; tying one's hands to hooks on the walls, so he could not sit down and then hanging bricks on the testes; sleep deprivation for a week at a time; and even placing live coals in the armpits and then tying the arms to the body until the coals cooled. Numerous prisoners were tortured to death and some were simply shot. The official explanations were that they committed suicide or were shot while trying to escape.\n\nThose working in prisons were proud of their inventiveness in torturing inmates. One such ill-famed tormentor was Dragomir (Dragi) Jovanovic in Belgrade's prison. He even received a state patent for \"inventing\" new and more horrific means of torture. One of his \"inventions\" was driving wooden pegs soaked in gasoline under the nails of an inmate and then setting the pegs on fire. (This same Jovanovic was one of the chief officials and executioners in Belgrade during the Second World War.) The Belgrade jail, Glavnjaca, became a symbol of the Karadjordjevic regime and of the Yugoslav state. (An emigrant paper named Protiv Glavanjace/Against the Glavnjaca was published in Belgium at that time.) The persecutions and humiliations went so far that the families of the victims would receive a bill to pay for the bullets by which their close relatives were shot.\n\nBesides using visible means of torture all oppressive regimes have other ways to persecute their opponents. These are more silent and perfidious. For example, losing or fear of losing one's job is often used as a major instrument of political punishment. The insecurity of one's own and/or his family's material existence can often be harder than physical punishment. This type of persecution was overwhelmingly used by the Yugoslav regime and it is hard to measure its impact on society, and on the Croatian national life in particular. State Watchdogs\n\nThe official guardians of the state and the main instruments of the Belgrade regime were the armed forces, gendarmes, police, and the state revenue police. Among them, the gendarmes were the main \"sword of the regime.\" This semi-military force was formed in January of 1919 to impose \"order\" in the country. But \"order\" was never achieved and the number of gendarmes increased from 10,000 to 60,000 by the early 1930s. The gendarmes were also often augmented by military forces on raiding missions. Besides the above mentioned forces, there were 15.000 secret police agents, plus military intelligence, and king's \"special agents.\"6 In addition to the above official guardians, there were a number of semi-official watchdogs of the state who were more than eager to help the regime to crash, what they labeled, the \"anti-state elements,\" \"dark forces,\" and \"defeatists\"! The following were the best known such organizations.\n\nza dogadanja 90-ih povijest ce suditi vama...\n\na sto je najbitnije, jednoga dana suditi ce te sami sebi...\n\np.s. ako nisi infiormiran...\n\nza vrijeme agresije Srbije na RH i terorista Srba uz poptporu JNA (koju smo mi vecim dijelom finanzirali)iz RH ubijeno je, ili stradalo oko 20 000 (dvadeset tisuca) hrvatskih gradana...a povijesne okolnosti su drugacije nego 40-ih\n\ni onda vi kukate...\n\nili si i ti jedan od onih koji je narucivao jeftinu bijelu tehniku iz RSK i jeftin gradevinski materijal...\n\na pojam etnickog ciscenja (i metode) na ovaj prostor uveli ste vi...i zato ste kaznjeni\n\nCardinal Aloysius Stepinac's mock trial, imprisonment, and death came to symbolize the sufferings of both the Catholic Church and the Croatian people in the former Yugoslav state.

A group of officers belonging to this organization assassinated King Aleksandar Obrenovic of Serbia and his wife Dara and secured the royal throne to the Karadjordjevic dynasty in 1903. It also attempted to assassinate King Nikola of Montenegro and his family in 1907. The Black Hand became the \"unseen government\" of Serbia. The organization modeled itself after the Italian Mafia, and the use of terror was the primary means to achieve its goal of Greater Serbia which, according to the Constitution of the organization consisted (besides of the Kingdom of Serbia) of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Old Serbia and Macedonia, Croatia, Srijem, Vojvodina, and the Sea-coast. By 1914 the Black Hand had close to 150,000 members according to some estimates. Although the Black Hand was officially eliminated during World War I (1917), because King Aleksandar out of fear and/or personal revenge turned against the organization, its sympathizers, goals, and methods were still very much alive during the inter-war period.\n\nThe White Hand\n\nIt is believed that because Prince Aleksandar was prevented from taking full charge of the Black Hand, he founded his own conspiracy organization within the Serbian military forces and named it the White Hand. Lieutenant-Colonel Petar Zivkovic, who became Prime Minister and the symbol of royalist oppression in the early 1930s, became head of the new organization. The White Hand was an army within the army. Its purpose was to eliminate the Black Hand and to be a semi-official protector of the state and Karadjordjevic's regime. Most of the political, judicial, economic, as well as military state decisions were made by such shadow forces in the country, first the Black Hand and then the White Hand.\n\nThe Chetniks (cheta means a cohort or a group)\n\nThe first written rules of Chetnik guerrilla type warfare were a translation of a Polish manual published in Belgrade in 1848.7 But the real beginning of the present-day Chetnik movement dates from 1903, when Serbian military officers organized a special training \"school\" for volunteers for the purpose of undertaking terrorist actions in Macedonia. At the time, Macedonia was a part of the ailing Ottoman empire and the main target of Serbian expansionism. The Chetniks became a useful instrument in executing special assignments (ethnic cleansing) of all who were not either Serbs nor ready to become Serbs in the regions that Serbia wanted to acquire. The Chetnik played a similar role during the two Balkan Wars and World War I, when they \"cleared the land\" of Turks, Albanians, Bulgarians, Macedonians and, toward the end of World War I, of Muslims in Sandzak and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nBetween the two world wars, although the Chetniks were split among themselves, they were united in guarding the state and in the struggle against \"dark forces.\" The Union of Chetniks for Freedom and Dignity of the Homeland became close to the Serbian Democratic Party, which was seen by many as not tough enough on the enemies of the state. This resulted into a split in 1924, when the Union of Serbian Chetniks - For the King and the Homeland was founded. This group became the tool of the Serbian Radical Party; the leader of this Chetnik faction, Punisa Racic, assassinated two and wounded three members of the Croatian political leadership in Belgrade's Parliament in 1928. The regime rewarded the Chetniks by giving them arms and permission to use them, land grants, and money: in fact, they were not required to obey many state laws. Also in 1924, the Union of Serbian Chetniks - Petar Mrkonjic (Named after king Peter) was formed in Sarajevo. The last two Chetnik organizations were especially aggressive in establishing their chapters in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an openly expressed goal of establishing a Greater Serbia.\n\nOrganization of Yugoslav Nationalists (Organizacija Jugoslavenskih Nacionalista/ORJUNA)\n\nThe ORJUNA was formed in Split by the royal regional administrator in Croatia in 1921. Its roots are in an organization named Yugoslav Progressive Nationalist Youth (Jugoslavenska Napredna Nacionalisticka Omladina/JNNO). Its \"heroic\" baptism of fire came when its members burnt the first issue of a newly founded Croatian newspaper in Split, \"Hrvatski List\" (Croatian Gazette). The ORJUNA was under the patronage of the Serb Democratic Party in Croatia. It gathered militant youth who supported the unitary Yugoslav state. Its chapters were formed first in Dalmatia, then in other parts of former Habsburg regions. The real reason for its formation was to have a terrorist organization for \"special assignments.\" As such ORJUNA became the leading instrument of terror against Croatian \"separatists,\" \"communists,\" \"defeatists,\" and all other \"dark elements\" in the country.\n\nUvek to tako biva, individualce je teško saterati u čopor....partijskog udruživanja...\n\nIn that spirit ORJUNA gave instructions to its members in Croatia (August 1921) that \"in these days of our activities, develop as much energy and action as possible. Our organization has to be firm and disciplined and stand firmly and resolutely against the separatists. After the assassination of Minister Draskovic [July 21, 1921], there is a need to start a struggle till the elimination not only of the communists, but of all those who are sowing hate against unitarism, the state, and Yugoslavism.\" 8\n\nORJUNA terrorist activities were committed quite openly and often with great pride. Its leadership emphasized that \"its terrorist actions contributed more than anything else to its own legitimization in the entire country....In practice, ORJUNA will propagate its goals by all possible means. It does not renounce the use of force. On the contrary it emphasizes the need for such type of actions.\"9\n\nORJUNA had special units known as Action Groups, which were organized in military fashion. According to one estimate, by 1925 the Action Groups had about 10.000 members.10 They had military style maneuvers on a regular basis, used military equipment, and usually the leading Chetnik figures were heading such Action Groups. Their holy principle \"Victory or Death\" was accompanied by yet another sacred declaration: \"Whoever is not with us, is against us!\" 11\n\nSerbian National Youth (Srpska Nacionalna Omladina/SRNAO)\n\nThe SRNAO was formed in 1922 at Belgrade University as the antitheses of ORJUNA, which was seen as too much Yugoslav-oriented and as such was polluting the true Serbian spirit and watering down their political goals. The ideology and political program of the SRNAO was formulated in a slogan: \"All the Serbs to Serbia, Serbia to all the Serbs!\" The goals of its existence, therefore, were \"guarding of the Homeland and the king, the spread of [Serbian] nationalism, and defense of Serbian accomplishments to the extermination of all anti-state and anti-national elements.\"12\n\nThe SRNAO was very close to the royal regime, to the Radical Party, to Punisa Racic's Chetniks and to the Union of Serbian Chetniks \"Petar Mrkonjic\" in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For example, on the occasion of the consecration of the SRNAO flag in Sarajevo, there was a personal delegate of the king, the government representatives, and a Serbian Church delegation. Leading men from all centers of power in Serbia were members of SRNAO. Nikola Pasic, the prime mover of Greater Serbian policies and the symbol of Serbian unitarism, was SRNAO's honorary president and its main financial supporter .13 The biggest obstacle to SRNAO's expansion in Croatia was the split between Svetozar Pribicevic, the main Serb politician in Croatia, and his former allies in Belgrade. Real confusion entered the SRNAO ranks, however, when Stjepan Radic, the leading Croat politician, made a deal with Pasic and entered the Belgrade government in 1925. The SRNAO did recover to some extent after the assassination of Radic(1928). After the King assumed all the power in the country and proclaimed Yugoslavism as the state national ideology (1929), SRNAO continued to work for its well defined goals but now under the Yugoslav name.\n\nSome other semi-official terrorist organizations Organization of the Reserve Officers and War Veterans - It emphasized its \"readiness and availability\" to defend the state and vowed to fight \"against all anti-state elements.\" 14\n\nThe Alliance of Volunteers - It constantly reminded the public that the state was not secure, its foundations were not firm, and that it was threatened by outside and inside enemies. It expressed readiness to continue the struggle for the security and stability of the state .15\n\nOrganized Youth - Its main mission was to destroy the Montenegrin Federalists and the followers of the exiled King Nikola of Montenegro.\n\nPeople's Defense - Its main purpose was \"to defend the newly established state by organized actions\" against all external and internal \"anti-state destructive activities and defeatist elements.\" 16\n\nPeople's Guard - It was organized in April of 1920. Its members proved themselves to be worthy of the regime's support during the violent suppression of the railroad workers' and miners' strikes in 1920. The Guard members served as shock troopers against the workers and their families. After the proclamation of the ill-famed \"Obznana\" banning the Communist party (December 29, 1920), the Guard numbers increased rapidly. They put themselves in the \"service of the state\" in order to eliminate the \"destructive elements which in these days [1920s] were ready to attack the state.\" 17 These formations were armed by the military authorities and were tools in the hands of the regime to do its \"dirty work.\"\n\nPatriotic Youth Front - This was a terrorist organization of the Bogoljub Jeftic's fascist party.\n\nYoung Yugoslavia - This was an ORJUNA militant organization for secondary school students who because of their age could not become full members of political parties.\n\nAll of the above groups followed the fascist model of organization, or at least they tried to. Fascists in Italy and Germany were hailed for their zeal and organizing capabilities. Such admiration is expressed, for example, by \"Jugoslovenska straza\" (Yugoslav Guard) (June 23, 1935): \"...[While] the fascist Italy is able to mobilize so many fascist formations and while Hitler's Germany resounds by the marches of the German youth, the Yugoslav youth can and must steel its soul and its muscles by joining the Chetnik organizations, where it will prepare itself for tomorrow's obligations that it must accept.\"\n\nBut these groups admired not only the fascist organizational model, they admired also Hitler for his anti-Semitism. The paper \"Jugoslovenska straza\" (Yugoslav Guard) clearly expresses such feelings when on October 6, 1935 wrote: \"Hitler was right when he went so far as to banish all of those who had even the smallest amount of Hebrew blood in their veins. Hitler was right when he pushed out such a vile sect from Germany.\"\n\nPobiti ova govna i nije neki greh.\n\nPersecutions of Croats in the newly formed South Slavic state had the opposite effect from what the guardians of the state and of the regime intended. Instead of preserving the state, it undermined its very existence. The fact is that most of the Croats could not identify with the Yugoslav state from its beginning because the state itself and the Serbian centralist regime was imposed upon them. The persecutions that followed simply alienated them even further from the Serbs and the state. Those Croats (and even some Serbs from Croatia) who once worked for the unification of the South Slavs became quicky disillusioned with the state and joined the anti-centralists and even anti-Yugoslav elements. Influential individuals outside the country who promoted unification of the South Slavs before and during the First World War and used to raise their voices against mistreatment of the Serbs and others in the Habsburg empire suddenly fell silent. Instead of condemning the use of terror and pressuring the regime to reform the country, they often blamed the victims. As a result, Croats increasingly felt more isolated in their desperate need for human and national rights.\n\nThe persecutions also helped to politicize and homogenize the Croatian nation, especially the rural population. Terror became a catalyst in crystalizing Croatian goals for nationhood. If there was confusion toward the end of World War I about which road to take, it became clear that Yugoslavia was not the answer. Elections clearly indicated that the Croats wanted a federalist republic as a minimum and an independent state of their own as maximum. As the terror against Croats increased, so did their demands escalate along with increasingly radical means to achieve them.\n\nAnother important consequence of the terror was a break with Croatian political traditions and pluralism. The old institutions of Sabor (parliament) and Ban (viceroy) were abolished. The traditions of personal liberties, rule of law, and tolerance of religious and ethnic differences were greatly undermined. Reserves of national energy were used up in inevitably resisting the attempts at Serbianization. According to Serb expansionists, their need to crush any move toward Croatian national identity was necessary because Croats did not have a history or culture of their own, besides being of a servile nature meant to be obedient to others.\n\nCroatians are usually depicted as the destroyers of both Yugoslavias. As a result, historians who would like to believe that Yugoslavia was a natural and positive historical development and the Serbs its true makers and defenders, ignore the persecutions of Croats and others,20 which in reality sealed the fate of the country from its very beginning. It is Serbian centralism, messianism, expansionism, and terrorism that eliminated even the possibility of a successful unification of the South Slavs.\n\nPobiti ova govna i nije neki greh.\n\nAmerican intellectuals organized by Roger N. Baldwin, Chairman of the International Committee for Political Prisoners, sent the following letter to the Yugoslav representative in Washington on November 24, 1933.\n\nDr. Leonide Pitamic,\n\nMinister of Yugoslavia,\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nSir:\n\nFor some years past dispatches in the American and foreign press have indicated that political prisoners in Yugoslavia are suffering inhuman treatment. This committee has noted the reports and has on occasion intervened in behalf of some particular prisoner as have many associations and individuals throughout the world interested in checking persecution for political opinions and activities.\n\nMore recently, we have obtained documentary material form one of our associates, Louis Adamic, and American writer of Yugoslav birth, lately returned from a year's stay in his native land as a fellow of the Guggenheim Foundation. Mr. Adamic's standing as a writer of integrity and accuracy is above question. We have substantiated to our satisfaction the genuineness of the material he has brought corroborating previous information.\n\nIn the light of these reports, and Mr. Adamic's specific information, we desire to protest, through you, to your government against the whole system of political persecution which marks the regime in Yugoslavia today and particularly against the incredible tortures inflicted on political prisoners under that system. These reports involve authentically reported tortures at police headquarters in Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Sarajevo, Skoplye, Novi Sad and other cities, as well as in various state penitentiaries. They affect the various groups opposed to the policies of the present government: the Croat, Slovene, Moslem, and Macedonian nationalists; the Socialists, Agrarians, and Communists.\n\nThese reports make it evident beyond question that scores if not hundreds of these prisoners are beaten and tortured before being brought to trial. The records show about 120 known cases of persons either directly killed or so tortured that they died. Such cruel and revolting methods employed during the so-called examination of prisoners are described as sticking needles under prisoners' fingernails, placing live coals between armpits and body, prolonged beating on the soles of the feet, driving sharp instruments into the heels and perpetrating outrages upon sexual organs. These methods are used in attempts to force confessions incriminating themselves and other men and women active in opposition movements.\n\nBut the tortures described are not confined to the period of preliminary examination. They continue after commitment to prison. Even those prisoners convicted of such trivial offenses as distributing opposition literature or belonging to opposition groups are systematically beaten and starved. Some are reliably reported as having been inoculated with disease germs, others have had iron bands clamped around their heads for months at a time. Conditions in the prisons are reported to be so inhuman that many prisoners must sleep on the bare floors of their unheated and wet cells. Against these unbearable conditions 248 men and women in the Sremska Mitrovica Prison are now said to be on a mass hunger strike.\n\nSolitary confinement of political prisoners and for long periods of time is another method against which we direct our protest. A reliable report come to us that Dr. Yovanovitch, former professor at Belgrade University, a well know political economist and leader of the Yugoslav Peasant Movement, is, or until very recently, was for several months in solitary confinement. We are advised, too, that Dr. V. Machek, leader of Croat Peasant Party, in serious ill health, is incarcerated under unsanitary conditions which may lead to his death.\n\nWe learn, too, that scores of prisoners particularly among the intellectuals, are exiled to the malaria-infested regions of Macedonia where they are required to report to the local police every few hours day and night.\n\nYour government must be aware that knowledge of brutalities such as these arouses the indignation of the civilized world. In the name of a section of the American public opposed to such severity against political opponents, we protest against the policies and methods of your government. So long as 2100 opponents remain in prison under conditions such as these they are a standing indictment of the claims of your government to recognition by the civilized world.\n\nWhile we are aware that condition in prisons in our own country are not above reproach, that political persecutions sometimes take place here as elsewhere, we are just as quick to condemn them here. But of all the reports which have come to us in recent years these from Yugoslavia are among the most appalling and barbarous.\n\nWe are, Sir,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nFor the Committee: Roger N.
