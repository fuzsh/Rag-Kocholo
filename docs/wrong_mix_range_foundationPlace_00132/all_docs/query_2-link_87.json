Released by Young Guitar Magazine “The Guitar Chapter” examines his stunning technique, and breaks down a number of songs from the earlier Symphony X albums.\n\nThe technique section doesn’t cover the development of each technique as much as it does Michael’s own particular applications in the context of a few different scale/arpeggio types (and some of this is seriously quick):\n\nAlternate Picking, Economy Picking, String Skipping, Legato (Diminished, Whole Tone, Harmonic Minor, Pentatonic) Pivot Licks, Sweep Picking and some killer examples of his awesome tapping technique. Although a little dated (Michael really should release something contemporary for the fans!) it’s still an informative look at one of the quiet giants of rock guitar.\n\nDownload\n\nfilesonic\n\nKod:\n\nhttp://www.filesonic.com/file/1075300881/e19.part1.rar http://www.filesonic.com/file/1075233071/e19.part2.rar http://www.filesonic.com/file/1075505571/e19.part3.rar\n\nNo pass\n\ntags:\n\nMichael Romeo, guitar chapter, Malmsteen, Steve Vai, Learn guitar, Paul Gilbert\n\nKOMPLETNU KOLEKCIJU VIDEO KURSEVA MOZETE SKINUTI NA WWW.GITARA1.COM\n\nVan Halen guitar method\n\n657 MB | xVid | 352x240 25 fps 1700 Kbs | 00:50:54\n\nEVH signature riffs such as two-handed tapping, whammy bar dives and effects, volume swells, pinched, tapped and open harmonics, preferred chordings and keys, hammer-ons and pull-offs, and much more are covered in mind-blowing detail.
