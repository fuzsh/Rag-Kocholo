        "text": "PARTI\n\nI. SERBS ARE SVARS ARE SERBS?\n\nF\n\nor more than several centuries questions relating to the origin and meaning of the ethnonymsSlav and Serb (also Sarb/Sarbski, Ser/Serski, Sur/Surski) have at- tracted the attention of outstanding scholars and generated a rich body of literature\n\non the subject in Continental Europe. In more recent times, the subject has been rather\n\noverwhelmed and somewhat degraded by research relating to Indo-European origins.\n\nRegarding this moment, J.P. Mallory, the author of the best English-language\n\nsurvey of Indo-European scholarship, writes:\n\nThe quest for the origins of the Indo-European has all the fascination of an electric light in the open air on a summer night: it tends to attract every species of scholar or would-\n\nbe savant who can take pen to hand. It also shows a remark-\n\nable ability to mesmerize even scholars of outstanding abil-\n\nity to wander far beyond the realm of reasonable specula-\n\ntion to provide yet another example of academic lunacy. It is sobering to recall that one of the greatest prehistorians of this century, V Gordon Childe, dismissed his own researches\n\ninto Indo-European origins as among the most childish\n\nthingshewrote( In Search of'Indo-Europeans,19 8 9 ).\n\nIndeed, Childe's attempt to impose a Pax Nordica of sorts on European prehis- tory by tracing the origin of the Indo-Europeans to a Nordic/North European cradle is certainly one of his more childish moments. Childe writes:Having then agreed that\n\ndie original Aryan belonged essentially to the Nordic race ... it remains to localize die cradle land ... At the present moment the Scandinavian theory is the most attractive, having been expounded with a wealth of detail and a complete mastery\n\nof the archaeological data by such profound students as Kossina, Schliz and\n\nSchuchardt( V Gordon Childe, T he Aryans, 1987).\n\nRelatively recent efforts to resolve the issues from a purely linguistic/etymological perspective—in terms of theoretical linguistic constructs (Proto-Slavic, Proto-Indo-Eu- ropean reconstructions) coupled with ethereal theorizing based on guesswork about\n\ndie etymologies of miscellaneous place names and allusions in heterogeneous\n\nsources to ethnonyms—have sometimes added new levels of insight and understand-\n\ning, but almost always new levels of speculation, complexity, and learned eccentricity\n\n(H.G.L unt,T he R us Primary Chronicle, HuS 19,1995). Whileth e linguistic/etymological theories\n\nhave a certain contemporary primacy in the entirely theoretical Proto-Indo-European context, in the case of the historical ethnonymSerb, the interdisciplinary method, ana- lytical frameworks with the highest integration of historical, textual, onomastic, and linguistic evidence, is better suited to the problem and provides a relatively firm and suggestive empirical basis for further research.\n\nFor such reasons, given the established Indo-Iranian dimensions of Proto-Slavic civilization, the established historical, textual, onomastic, and linguistic facts of the mat- ter, this section focuses on mythological-religiousP roto-Slav/Serb links with Indo-Ira- nian based languages and civilizations. Without guilt or remorse, therefore, we begin with a highly speculative, exploratory review of some of the historical-linguistic evidence that appears to relate the ethnonymsSarb/Surb/Srb toSvar, an ancient, cardinal Indo- Iranian word connoting heaven, sky, sun, light, and fire, to cognates connoting creation, universe, all, everything:\n\n—To Svar as in Isvara, 'supreme lord and originator'; Isvara, 'immanent deity'; Svar, 'heaven'; Svar-gapat, 'lord and creator of heaven and earth'; Svarga, 'lord Indra's Heaven'; Svargadvara, 'gates of heaven'; Svargakama, 'desire for heaven'; Svargaloka, 'world of heaven'; Svarupa, 'nature,' 'essence'; Svarupa-jnana, 'divine knowledge.'\n\n—To Svar as in Sur-ya, the most concrete of the solar deities: from Sur-ya, 'the orb of the sun,' 'the face of the great Agni,' 'the eye of Mitra and Varuna,' 'the lord of eyes', 'the farseeing, all-seeing god who beholds all beings and the good and bad deeds of mortals.'\n\nAlso: Ardhanarisvara, 'androgynous godhead'; Atmesvara, 'lord of the soul';\n\nGovsesvara, 'lord of the cows and bulls'; Mahesvara, 'maternal goddess'; Padapesvara, 'lord of trees'; Paramesvara, 'highest lord'; Sarevesvara, 'supreme lordship'; [SjVaruna, 'supreme god of early Vedism, creator of the three worlds, heaven, earth and air'; Vasisvarana, 'sacred fire'; Visvarupadarshana, 'supreme principle'; Visesvara, 'lord of the universe'; Yogisvara, 'supreme saint.'\n\nSURS, SARBS\n\nIt should be noted that there is in historical fact a certain precedent for a Sur- basedSarb ethnonym in Indo-Iranian history. Regarding the origin of one of the great tribes of Afghanistan, a leading authority writes: TheVais are the Surs (Surajbansi) or\n\nSutya (Suryavansi), the 'solar race of Hindustan' and the Sarbs (Sarbanri) or Sarahs\n\n(Sarabani) in the Afghan classification of tribes.Similarly, a major division of the\n\nIsmail Afghan tribal complex is called theSurs and a minor division theSarbs orSarbi s\n\n(H. W. Bellew, An Inquiry into the Ethnography of Afghanistan, 1891).\n\nSARVAS, SARBS\n\nMoreover, from a strictly linguistic/etymological perspective, O.N. Trubacev, one\n\nof the foremost Linguists/Slavists of the modern era, believes it is possible to derive the\n\nSerb ethnonym from Old Indo-European sarva connoting all, everything, everyone.\n\nSince Trubacev's (theoretical) Old Indo-Europeansarva is related to (factual) Indo-Ira-\n\nniansvar, Old Indo-Europeansarva appears to be either a roundabout way of deriving\n\nSerbf r o m Svar or a giant etymological step in that direction\n\nEUROPEAN HISTORY\n\nThe notion that the Serb ethnonym is derived fromSvar has deep roots in Euro-\n\npean historical scholarship. Medieval German documents record that some Serb tribes\n\nsettled in Germania were calledS v ars. Naming the ancient Serb tribe that settled along\n\nthe Mulde near Leisnig, citing local sources, a 16th century German historian mentions theSv ars: Svarini oder Svardones oder Svordi.' In the same period, another German historian and commentator on Tacitus's Germania, E. Stella, is certain that:Tacitus's\n\nSvars or Svarines are not only Serbs, but Serbs who retained their ancient and\n\noriginal name.2\n\nSVARTOV, TRAVA RIVERS\n\nMore concrete evidence of the ancient and original name in Germania is found in place names, hydronyms, and toponyms derived from Svar. Medieval sources, for ex- ample, locate Lübeck at the confluence of the Svartov and Trava rivers. Also: Svartava, northeast of Sorby and Sorbino, southeast of Perun; Svartebok, near Ratmir, Crnobog, and Drazevo; Svartava River, near Klecov, Goleska, and Penica; Svartav, near Lubici and Radkov; Svartov, northwest of Svetla Strana; Lake Svartica, northeast of Babica, Dobra, Draze, and Rogolin; Zuarina grad, northeast of Zverin, modern Schwerin.3\n\nSVAR.SVAROG\n\nIt was well-known to medieval German chroniclers that the Serbs wereSvars in a primal, religious sense—the people of Svar, Svaroh, Svarog, Svarozic, the Supreme God, Lord and Creator, the God of the Shining Sky, who reigns supreme over Heaven and Earth, the Lord and Master of the Universe.4\n\nBOGSVAROG\n\nIt is important to note that the letter and spirit of the Serb-Slavic word for god,\n\nbog,as in ^o^Svar or Svarog, as well as i t s m a t e r i a l cognates (bogat,rich; bogatstvo,w ealth)\n\nare also derived from the Indo-Iranian tradition.5\n\nBHAGA, BAGA\n\nThe Sanskrit root is bhaj, to share, distribute. Thus bhaga (Iranian baga): 'the celestial dispenser of good fortune and prosperity'; baga, 'he who distributes good things'; bhaga, 'god of good fortune'; bhagesa, 'lord of happiness'; bhagwan, 'supreme god who created other gods and made them bearers of light'; bhagyam, 'fortune'; saubhagy, 'good luck'; subhaga, 'blessed'; bhoga, 'delight'; upabhoga, 'enjoyment'. Also the 'divine one' as in Bhagavad Gita (Song of the Divine One); Bhagavan, 'the noble, holy, exalted, and sublime one'; Savita Bhaga, 'the sun god'.\n\nBOGISLAV\n\nIn medieval Germaniab og/b oz h is a common element of Slavic personal (Bogislav, Bogolub), family (Bogovici, Bozkovici, Bozov), and Germania place names (Bogumil, later Bomsdrof; Bozetin, later Bozetindorf; Bozici, later Positz). Also Bogumysl, now Bademeusel, and Myslbog, now Meuselwitz.\n\nREGEM EORUM BOZ NOMINE\n\nIt is a matter of record that Bog as Bozh is a favored name of early Slavic rulers. In\n\nthe early 4th century, for example, Bozh is recorded as the ruler of the mighty Antes\n\n(regem eorum Boz nomine}. Several centuries later, a tsar Bozh is said to rule over the\n\nAntes lands.\n\nTHE ALL POWERFUL ONE\n\nHelmold of Bosau, a Saxon cleric who lived in the region of Lübeck around\n\n1170, was an especially keen if not impartial observer of the pagan Slavs. Helmold's\n\nChronica Slavorum offers a rather clear and precise statement of Svarog's supremacy and\n\nrelation to other gods in the Slavic pantheon: Svarog was the one god in the heavens\n\nruling over all others. They hold that the all powerful one looks after heavenly matters only; that the others, discharging the duties assigned to them in obedi- ence to him, proceeded from his blood; and that one excels the other in the mea- sure that he is nearer to the god of gods.\n\nTHE SLAV DELPHI\n\nInB ishopT h ietm ar'sc h ro n ic le( Chronic on)there is a firsth a n da c c o u n tofS v a ro g ' s\n\ntemple aturbs Radogost in pago Riedierun, the great sanctuary of the Slavs, the Slav\n\nDelphi: The triangular, three-gated citadel of Radegast is situated in the Redarii\n\ndistrict. The fortress stands in the middle of a great forest regarded by the natives as sacrosanct. Two of the gates are open to all. The third and smallest, to the east, faces a path leading to a neighboring lake of most gloomy aspect. The citadel contains but a single shrine, a wooden structure built upon a foundation of the horns of various animals. Its walls are decorated on the outside, so far as can be seen, with a number of finely carved images of gods and goddesses. Inside the shrine stands a number of man-made idols, each with its incised name, in full armour, terrifying to view. The tallest is called Svarozich and is much feared and revered by the heathens. Their standards are also kept there, only to be removed in case of war and then by foot-soldiers exclusively. Every district in the country has a temple of its own, worshiped by the infidels, but the citadel just mentioned is the most important. The tribesmen take leave of it when they march to war and offer it suitable gifts ... if they return victorious.6\n\nAn eminent modern authority on the period, J.W. Thompson, writes of the\n\ntemple's immense authority throughout Germania:Upon its wall hung the colored\n\nbanners of every Slavonic tribe between the Erzgebirge and the Baltic, and the trophies of victorious wars. The priests of Retra cast omens before every cam- paign. With them lay the final determination of war and peace( F eudalGerm any ,19 2 8 ).1\n\n2. JAROVID, SVETIVID, TRIGLAV\n\nS\n\nvttr, the supreme god, was known by other names. Some of these names were\n\nrelated to an essential activity or function. Thus the wargod J ar or J arovid, cog-\n\nnates ofS v a r , recorded by German chroniclers in the 12th century: Deum suum\n\nGerovitum; Cuisudam idoli Geroviti nomine celebritatem agebat; Gerovito, qui deus\n\nmilicie eorumfiiit; In Hologosta civitate... deo suo Gerovito dtcitur.1\n\nVOLIGOST\n\nSoon after entering the town of Voligost, Otto, the Apostle of Pomerania, en-\n\ntered a great temple dedicatedto J a ro vid , where, Herbord writes:There was hanging\n\non the wall a shield of great size and of marvelous workmanship, covered with\n\nsheets of gold, which no human might touch, because in it was something sacro-\n\nsanct and which betokened their pagan religion, so that it -would never be moved\n\nout of its place save only in time of war. For, as we afterwards found, it was dedi-\n\ncated to their god Gerovit, who in Latin is called Mars, and the people were confi-\n\ndent of success in every battle in which it went before them.\n\nHAVELBERG\n\nThere is good evidence thatJ a r o v id was alive and well in the early 12thcentury and that there were temples dedicated toJ a ro v id throughout the lands of the Slavs, including Havelburg on the Havel River. To Otto's great distress, Havelburg had been\n\nso completely ruined by the incursions of the heathen that there remained in it\n\nhardly anyone who bore the Christian name. On the very day of his [Otto's] arrival\n\nflags were placed around the town, which was engaged in celebrating a festival in\n\nhonour of an idol called Gerovit. When the man of God perceived this, he was\n\npricked to the heart on account of the great delusion of its people and refused to\n\nenter the walls of the town.\n\nCHRISTIAN SYMPATHY\n\nIt is interesting that Thietmar of Merseburg's account of a pagan Slav assault on Christian missionary stations at Havelberg and Brandenburg in the very late 10th cen- tury suggests a noticeable degree of Christian sympathy for such attacks on Christian sanctuaries and images.The revolt started with the murder of garrison troops at\n\nHavelberg and the destruction of the episcopal see. The days after the attack a\n\ngroup of Slavic rebels assaulted Brandenburg's diocese ... The priests were taken prisoners... All of the church treasures were stolen, and blood covered the grounds. Where Christ and his disciple, Saint Peter, once stood, cults of diabolical supersti- tions were established; a sad change, which not only pagans but also some Chris-\n\ntians welcomed.\n\nJAROMIR, JARINA GRAD\n\nMedieval sources reveal numerous personal and family names derivedf rom J ar in Germania (e.g. Jarobud, Jarognev, Jarosin, Jaromir, Jaroslav). Medieval sources also reveal numerous place names, including fortified settlements, derived fromJ ar in Germania east and west of the Elbe: Jargolin; Jarichovo grad; Jarina grad; Jarisin; Jarkovici; Jarkovo; Jarkun grad; Jarognev; Jarochol grad; Jarochov; Jarom; Jaromir; Jaromirici;\n\nJaronici; Jaroslav; Jarosin; Jarosov; Jarovec; Jarovici.2\n\nSVAR, JAR, ZAR\n\nFromSvar/Jar the Serb wordsjar, as injarko sunce or radiant sun,andjarost,\n\nconnoting intense, scorching, torrid heat, fire. Also the words zar, zarenje, zariti, zarki,\n\nzarkost, connoting heat, warmth, brightness, glowing, red-hot fire. Like jar, zar is also\n\nthe root of numerous place names recorded in medieval Germania (e.g. Zar, Zargom,\n\nZarchom, Zarice, Zarkim, Zarnovica, Zarov, Zary, Zarno).\n\nSVAR, SVETI VID\n\nOther names relate toS v a r ' s supreme attributes. Thus Svaris Sveti Via,the\n\nlord of eyes, the far-seeing, all-seeing god, who beholds all beings and the good\n\nand bad deeds of mortals.Saxo Grammaticus'Gesta Danorum is an important source\n\nof detailed information on the legendaryS vetiVi d ( Z vantevit) cult centre at Arkona\n\non the Baltic island of Rügen.3 A Danish monk, Saxo, took part in a crusading expedi-\n\ntion against the pagan Slavs of Rügen in 1168 and witnessed the destructionof Sveti\n\nVid'ste m p le .In the temple stood an enormous statue, taller than any human f or m,\n\nwith four heads and necks, which lent it a somewhat terrifying appearance. Two looked ahead, and two behind, one faced the right, and another the left. The mous- tache was shaven, and the hair cut in deliberate imitation of the style usually af- fected by the Rani [Rugenites]. In its right hand it held a horn, fashioned in a variety of precious metals ... The left hand was supported against its side as if the arm were bent. The robe fell to the calves, which were of a different wood, and at the knee was a joint that you would fail to see unless you looked very closely. The feet were at ground level, for the pedestal was buried in the earth. To one side you could see the bit, saddle, and various insignia; a sword of extraordinary size in- creased the wonder of it all, and the admirable work on sheath and hilt enhanced the intrinsic value of the silver.\n\nOMNI NATIONE SCLAVORUM\n\nThe Sveti Vid cult's pan-Slav character is noted by Helmold in the following\n\nwords:Zv an t ev i t deus t erre Rug i an o rum i n t er o m n i a n um i n a Sclav o rum pri m at aum\n\nobtinuerit; et fecit prudci simuachrum illud antiquissimum Zvantevith, quod\n\ncolebaturt ab omni natione Sclavorum.\n\nSVETOVID, SVETOVIT\n\nIn his excellent survey of the abundant empirical evidence relating to the scope\n\nand depthof S vetiVi d's influence on South Slavic religious civilization (e.g.Sv eto v i d,\n\nSvetovit), P. Simunovic also finds evidence of a significant medieval political moment—\n\nthe names of medieval Slavic rulers.4lako se pri manjem krscanstva kult slavenskog\n\nbozanstva Svetovit upleo u kult sv. Vida, ostavivsi name pokoje onomasticke i folklorne preztike, ne moze se zanijekati i ne uzeti i obzir u tvorbi nekih od navedenih imena slavenski imenski korijen vit-/-vit. kojji je u imenu bozanstva Svetovit(b), u imenu kneza posavske Hrvatske Ljudevita (817-825), u davno potvrdenim imenima: Dragovit, Trebevit, Dobrovit (11. st.), Vitotnir (9 st.), Vitogoj (10. st.), Vitina (10. st.), ukojimavit- /-vitznaci \"dominus\", \"potens\", \"mogucnik\", kako su to vec davno istrazili istaknuti slavenski onomasticari. Sventovit je, dakle,\n\n\"gospodar svjetla\", Ljudevit je \"vladar ljudi\".

N. Afanasiev sums upS va ro g in the following\n\nterms: Svarog, as a personification of the sky, sometimes lighted by the sun's rays,\n\nsometimes covered with clouds, and brilliant with lightning, was considered to be\n\nthe father of the sun and of fire. In the shadows of the clouds he would kindle the\n\nlightning's flame and thus he appeared as the creator of celestial fire. As for terres-\n\ntrial fire, it was a divine gift brought to Earth in the form of lightning. Hence it\n\nwill be understood why the Slavs worshiped Fire as a son of Svarog.5\n\nIMPARTING LIFE TO THE SUN\n\nRegardingS varog' s relation to the Slav solar cult, Afanasiev writes: Afterwards,\n\nsplitting the clouds with flashing arrows, Svarog would cause the sun to appear, or\n\nin the metaphorical language of antiquity, he would light the torch of the sun\n\nwhich had been extinguished by demons of the shadows. This poetic conception\n\nwas also applied to the morning sun emerging from the veils of night. With the\n\nsunrise and the renewal of its flame the idea of its rebirth was connected\n\nHIGHER TRUTH\n\nEven today, it should be noted, some would go so far as to say that then and now\n\na solar cult represents a higher truth. On this point, Lloyd M. Graham writes: A sunis\n\na cosmic crucible in which that cross called matter is made, in other words, a transmuter of cosmic energy—a fact known thousands of years ago and reduced to myth: 'Prometheus was the first to transmute atoms fit for human clay.' Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven and brought it down to Earth, is but a solar fire per-\n\nsonified. Here the fire is imprisoned in matter. This is 'Prometheus Bound.'When\n\nreleased by radiation it is 'Prometheus Unbound'... All this the ancients knew and\n\nleft to thewor ld inwha t wecall the'AncientW i sdom'(L M.Graham, DeceptionsandM y ths\n\nof the Bible, 1975).\n\nNOT THE WORD OF GOD\n\nAccording to this view, the Judaeo-Christian theology is nothing more than a\n\ngarbled perversion of ancient wisdom and cosmic truths:The Bible is not 'the word of\n\nGod,' but stolen from pagan sources. Its Eden, Adam, and Eve were taken from the\n\nBabylonian accounts; its Flood or Deluge is but an epitome of some four hundred\n\nflood accounts; its Ark and Ararat have their equivalents in a a score of Deluge\n\nmyths; even the names of Noah's sons are copies; so also Isaac's sacrifice, Solomon's\n\njudgment, and Samson's pillar act; Moses is fashioned after the Syrian Mises; its\n\nlaws after Hammurabi's code. Its Messiah is derived from the Egyptian Mahdi,\n\nSavior, certain verses are verbatim copies of Egyptian scriptures. Between Jesus\n\nand the Egyptian Horus, Gerald Massey found 137 similarities, and those between\n\nGhrist and Krishna run into the hundreds.\n\nBy confusing the laws of nature, the Creation process, with the will of God,\n\nGraham believes, the Judaeo-Christian theology confuses Hell with Heaven. Thus he\n\nwrites:God wills it! God wills it! is the cry of every mass murderer on record.\n\nENDNOTES\n\nPS. Efimenko, O larile, iazycheskom bozhevstve russkikh slavian, 1969. M.

CELE NASE POHANSKE\n\nBAGESLOVI INDICKE GEST: PURAN/PERUN\n\nAccess to ancient Sanskrit texts in early 19th century Eu- rope shed new light on the origin and character of an- cient Slavic mythology. Successive studies appeared to reveal deeper and broader connections with ancient India and Iran, so much so that it was hard to escape the idea that ancient Slavic civilization shared a common ances- try with ancient Indo-Iranian civilization. Thus the dra- matic conclusion reached by J. Kollar (1798-1852), the great Slovak poet, scholar, and Slavist, in an essay on commonalities and parallels in Indian and Slavic mythol-\n\nogy(Srovnalost Indice a Slavske Mythologie): Gele nase\n\npohanske bageslovi indice gest (Our entire pagan reli-\n\ngious mythology is Indie in origin and character).1\n\nn the Vedic system, the various gods are not separate entities, but merely\n\naspects of the supreme lord and creator, manifestations of the immanent\n\ndeity.\n\nINDRA\n\nLord Indra, a name perhaps related to proto-Slavjenttru oijedru (strong), was an immensely popular manifestation. Some scholars find traceso f Perun in Indra's prede- cessor, Varun, an earlier Indo-Iranian sky-god of rain and storm and protector of oaths.2 From his role as God of war and storms, the cognomens Puran-dara (destroyer of\n\ncities); Paran-ya (thunderbolt), and mighty Indra (thousand-testicled Indra or\n\nsahasramuska), the main subject of early Vedic hymns.3\n\nASPECTS OF THE SUPREME LORD AND CREATOR\n\nThe same is true of the pagan Slav system. Here, too, the gods are aspects of the Supreme Lord and Creator; they are manifestations of the universal causality. Here, too, lordPerun , the god of war and storms, is a popular and powerful manifestation of the Slav god of gods,Sv aro g .4 Thus it is not surprising that in a mid-6th century work, commenting on the religion of the Slavs, Procopius identifiesSv aro g i n termso fPerun 's\n\nattributes: They in fact regard one god, the creator of lightning, as the lord and\n\nmasterof theuniverse;they sacrificeoxenandother animals to him( De Bellis Gothico)?\n\nPRIMARY CHRONICLE\n\nLater sources affirmPerun s central position in the pagan Slav hierarchy.Perun is\n\na prominent figure in the most ancient Russian chronicle, best known as theNac alnaja\n\nLetopiso r Primary Chronicle.A ccording to the Chronicle,P erunis the p r i m a r y g u a r a n t o r\n\nof treaties between Kievan Russia and Byzantium in the 10th century.\n\nGRAND PRINCE OLEG\n\nFollowing the religion of Grand Prince Oleg (879-912) and the Russes,Perun is\n\nthe guarantor of a 907 peace treaty with Byzantium: Thus the Emperors Leo and\n\nAlexander made peace with Oleg and agreed to pay tribute, and they took the\n\noath among themselves by kissing the cross, but let Oleg and his men-at-arms\n\ntake the oath, according to the Rus law: they swore by their arms, and by Perun,\n\ntheir God and Volos, the cattle god and established peace. Furthermore they swore\n\nby their arms not in the German manner, but taking their weaponso ff and put-\n\nting them at the feet of the idol, in accordance with their own custom.\n\nVOLOSIn order to understand whyVo lo s, the god of cattle (the Serbianv o andvol are\n\nancient and modern Slavic words for cattle), is mentioned as a guarantor of oaths in this and other treaties, once again one must turn to Indo-Iranian mythology.6 It is only natural that cowherds and cattle orgo play an important role in the Vedic order, in a community of herders and stockbreeders. Thus Govrsesvara, lord of cattle; Mount Govardhana, where cattle graze and multiply; Goloka, above the world of gods and Brahmans, the world of cattle, the highest region, beyond which there is no region. In Zoroastrian mythology, Vohu Manu is the good spirit's first born. Vohu is the god of cattle, the sacrificial animals. His world equivalent is the cow, bull, ox. What is more important, Vohu is the shepherd of mankind. In opposition to Ako Manu, the evil spirit, Vohu guides the people to good thinking and righteous behavior and keeps the records of men's deeds, words, and thoughts.\n\nGRAND PRINCE IGOR, GRAND PRINCESS OLGA\n\nFollowing a 945 peace treaty with Byzantium, Grand Prince Igor (913-945) and\n\nhis men went to a hill in Kiev: Where there was a statue of Perun. There they laid\n\ndown their arms and swore to keep the treaty.7It is said that Grand Princess Olga's\n\n(945-964) warriors swore by their arms and invoked the nameo f Perun .\n\nGRAND PRINCE SVYATOSLAV\n\nIn a 972 treaty with Byzantium, Grand Prince Svyatoslav (964-972) bound him-\n\nself and his subjects to uphold the conditions of the treaty in the following words:I,\n\nSvyatoslav, Russian Prince ... wish to have peace and abiding friendship with all the great Greek emperors inspired by God, and with all your people; and so do all the Rus subject to me ...N ever will I attack your land, or gather an army, or guide a foreign people against those subject to the Greek Government. If we do not observe this ... may we be accursed by the god in whom we believe, by Perun, and Volos the god of flocks, may we become yellow as gold, and perish by our own\n\nweapons.\n\nVLADIMIR VELIKI\n\nVladimir Veliki (980-1015), later,S vy atoy V ladim ir, Apostle of Russia, lived most\n\nof his life as a pagan, and ruled in the nameo f Perun until his baptism in 988:Vladimir\n\nthen began to reign alone in Kiev. And he set up idols on the hill outside the\n\ncastle courtyard. A wooden Perun with a head of silver and whiskers of gold ... The people sacrificed to them calling them gods ... They desecrated the earth with their offerings, and the land of Rus and that hill were defiled with blood.\n\nNOVGOROD\n\nPerun was also supreme in the great city of Novgorod: Vladimir then put his\n\nuncle Dobrynia in Novgorod. And when Dobrynia arrived at Novgorod he raised\n\nan idol to Perun on the banks of the river Volkhov; and the people of Novgorod\n\noffered sacrifices to it as if to God himself.\n\nPERIN HILL\n\nTwentieth century excavations have uncovered a number of pagan sanctuaries in the lands of the Western and Eastern Slavs. One of the more interesting and revealing sites is the sanctuary dedicated toPerun near Novgorod Veliki. V.V. Sedov writes:The\n\nPerin hill magnificently dominates the northern low-lying and woodless banks of\n\nthe Ihnen lake. The principle sanctuary was raised above the surrounding area...\n\nin die form of a regular circle ... Here [in the center of the circle] stood a wooden\n\nstatue of Perun ... In front of the idol there was an altar, a circle made of cobble\n\nstones. The ditch surrounding the cult was not a simple ring, but a thin rim in\n\ndie form of a huge flower with eight petals ... During pagan festivals a ritual\n\nbonfire was lit on the bottom of each ditch projection ... and an eternal flame\n\nburnt in the eastern projection facing the Volkhov river. The layout of the sanctu-\n\nary is likely to be a geometric representation of one of the flowers devoted to\n\nPerun. The pagan Slavs are known to be fond of devoting flowering plants to\n\nPerun. The ditch, which surrounded the site with the idol, was of a ritual signifi-\n\ncance likethoseof barrowditches (V.V. Sedov, Pagan sanctuariesandidolsof the Eastern Slavs,SlG 7-8,\n\n1980-81).\n\nIN GERMANIA\n\nIn medieval German sources there are numerous, albeit rather muddled, refer-\n\nences toPerun . Helmold, for example, refers to:\n\n• Pro v e (Prove deus Aldenburg; Prove deus Aldenburgensis terre)\n\n• Puruvit(in Garz, tria idola ... et Puruvit nominabantur)\n\n• Po ren ut i( Quo suc c iso, P orenuti tem plum appetitur)\n\nPERUNMore certain and concrete references toPerun in Germania are found in language\n\nand place names. As late as the 17th century the native Slavs of Hanover called Thursday\n\nPerundan. In northeastern Germania, on the coast, near Stralsund, one finds Perun,\n\nnorth of Zalikov,Mo ko sa,and Dev i n , place names that resonate with strong and vivid\n\npagan sounds and rhythms. Further west, anotherPerun is recorded near Dargun Grad,\n\nsoutheastof Svetina Grad and Slavomir Grad(H . Skalova, MistopisnaMapauz em iO b odric uaL utic u,\n\nVpS3,1960).\n\nT. Witkowski notes thatPerun is the original name of Prohn (Perun, 1240), a\n\nsmall village near Stralsund, and Pronstorf (Perun/Perone (1199), near Segeberg, and\n\nperhaps Pirna (Perne, 1233; Pyrne,1239), near Dresden( T .

In 911 Grand Prince Oleg sent his muzhi to conlude peace and draw up a treaty between Rus and the Greeks. Decades later, in 944,Igor sent his muzhi to Roman, and Roman called together his boyars and dignitaries. Evidence of the deep roots of this institution is found in the fact that them uz hi played a similar role in Russian entities organized on a tribal basis. In one embassy, for example, it is recorded that the Drevlyane sent to Olga their best muzhi,\n\nnumbering twenty, in a boat;in another embassy, the Drevlyane chose their best muzhi who ruled the land of\n\nthe Drevlyane and sent them after her.In turn, Olga tells the Drevlyane, send me noble muzhi.\n\nN.S.

Broji oko pet stotina domova. Zemljiste je nagnuto öd Rutnije k\n\ntnora, klima je primorska, radja razno voce. Öd maslina cijede ulje na domacim nilinovima. Od gornjih sela ispod Rumije znatniji su Mali i Velji Mikulici. Ostala se spustaju s jedne i druge strane planinskog vijenca Lisinja do Mozure i tnora. Od donjih sela glavno je Velje Selo. M. se kao pleme izmedju Bara i Ulcinja spominju 1409. Staro sjediste plemena bill su Mikulici, odakle se ovo pleme razvilo i spustilo k moru. Kasnjije je sjediste i zborno m j es to postalo Velje Selo, najvece u\n\nM. Od starine su M imali kao glavnog starjesinu plemena barjaktara. Bili su nekada\n\npravoslavni Srbi, pa su od prije dvjesta godina poceli mijenjati vjeru, a od prije sto\n\ngodina svi su primili Islam. Cestu su na njihovom zemljistu tragovi starih crkava.\n\nPored nesto doseljenika iz raznih strana, glavna masa stanovike je stara. To su\n\nstari M koje je prijelaz u Islam ocuvao. U pravoslavnom brastvu Androvica u Veljim\n\nMikulicima cuva se krst, za koji vjeruju da je bio u rukama zetskog kneza Jovana\n\nVladimira, lead je poginuo u Prespi. O Trojcinu dana iznose M. i Krajinjani sve\n\ntrivjere tajkrst naRumi ju uzveli ku ipobozn usvecanost( S. Stanojevic, Entiklopedija Srba,\n\nHrvata i Slovenaca)?\n\nRADOMIR\n\nIn its center, Velje Selu, on a commanding height, Radomir, one finds the Cathe- dral Church of Sv. Ilia, where, from the most ancient times, theMrko jev i c gathered each year on St. Ilia's Day or Ilindan to discuss and resolve community affairs.\n\nVOJNADRUZHINA\n\nIn the mid-15th century theMrko jev i cvojna druz hina (military fraternity) enters into an alliance with Venice and thereafter plays an important role in Venice's defense of Bar and Ulcinj on land and Venice's maritime dominance in the eastern Adriatic. Vene- tian registers offer important documentary evidence relating to the number and vitality of theMrko jev i c contribution to the anti-Ottoman wars in the 17th century. With sev- eral exceptions all theMrko jev i cs, generally recorded asMarko v i ci in Latin/Venetian sources(n o bi li ssi m uset frequen t i ssi m usest pag usMarco v i chi o rum ) have typical Serb names( G.S tanojevic , J edanplatnispisakm om ara iof irira mletackih naoruzanih barke iz16 2 6 godine,Isto rijski Z apisi\n\nXX, 1976).\n\nANDRIJAIVOV, VUKO NIKOV\n\nThe several exceptions to the rule appear to be early converts to Islam, namely Osman Ivanov, Deli Murat and Zafir Hin, who served together with their Chrstian brothers- in-blood if not in faith.\n\nAndrija Ivov\n\nOstoja Ratkov\n\nDjuro Perov\n\nPero Boskov\n\n[Sargente] Ivo\n\nPero Djurov\n\nIvo Dabov\n\nPero Marov\n\nIvo Markov\n\nPero Milov\n\nIvo Perov\n\nPero Nikov\n\nIvo Vulev\n\nPetar Markov\n\nLuka Nikov\n\nRado Ilin\n\nMarkisha Perov\n\nStefan Ivov\n\nMilo Mladenov\n\nStijepo\n\nMilosh Milankov\n\nVuko Ivov\n\nNikisha Djurov\n\nVuko Nikov\n\nNikola Vukov\n\nDEMOCRACY\n\nAs is always the case in western alliances with Montenegrin communities, the\n\nVenetians are stunned by their thoroughly democratic character. In the case of the\n\nMrkojevic,f o r example, t h e V e n e t i a n s soon learn t h a t every a d u l t male appears to have a\n\ntitle and function meriting recognition and payment. Ultimately, nearly one-third of the\n\nMrkojevicdem and and receive certain privileges a n d ex em p tio n s f r o m V enetian a u t h o r i -\n\nties.\n\nISLAM\n\nWhen Christianity vanished, after theMrko jev i c adopted Islam, Sv. Ilia remained\n\nthepleme'sv ita l center, t h e i n d o m i t a b l e g u a r d i a n of a n c i e n t t r a d i t i o n s a n d values.4 Like-\n\nwise, Ilindan assemblies remained real and symbolic guarantors of communal unity and solidarity. In a true and authentic expression of ancient values and loyalties, soon after the Cathedral's severe damage by an earthquake in 1979, the MoslemMrko jev i c at home and abroad began raising funds for its restoration.\n\nNEWORDER\n\nTheMrko jev i c are proud of the fact that during World War II, though the New Order's occupying forces, following standard imperial policies, did everything in their power and more to incite a confessional war in the region, to place Orthodox, Moslem, and Catholic Serbs at each other's throats, there was not a single instance of religous conflict. Ramo Dapcevic captures thisMrko jev i c moment in the following words:Ovdje\n\nse nije desilo da je brat brata ubio, musliman pravoslavnoga, ill pravloslavni\n\nmusliman, izmedju vjera da je nesto bilo. Nikako. Nego, kao jedna dusa. Ne mozes\n\nrazlikovati nista. Naroda je povezan, vrlo dobar. lako su tri vjerispovijesti, nidje\n\nse nije pojavilo da prezire pravoslavni muslimana, ill musliman pravoslavnog ili\n\nkatolika, no ka'da su od jedne majke. I u ratu se pomagalo, ne samo u ovome\n\nkraju, nego sve do Boke Kotorske. Dolazili su odjen da uzimaju hljeba i zita. Ovi\n\nnarod,ko go je ima,da' je.Neko je proda.Aliodavdeni konijei zasagladan( S usreti,\n\nJanuary-Feburary, 1990).\n\nILINOBRDO, ILINDAN\n\nSeveral miles north of Bar, in the rugged heights along the coast, one finds Mount Ilia or Ilino Brdo. On its summit, there is a small chapel dedicated to Sv. Ilia. It is here, on this vigilant height, from times immemorial, on Ilindan, Serbs from the core lands of medieval Duklja, from Crmnica, Papratna, and Krajina, Serbs of all confessions and faiths, Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Moslem, gathered to honor and celebrateSv .\n\nIlia the Thunderer.'\n\n6. DAZHBOG, KHORS,\n\nSTRIBOG, SIMAR'GL AND MOKOS\n\nA\n\nccording to Procopius, the pagan Slavs worshiped many spirits and made offerings to all, and they made vows and predictions at their sacrifices. A number of recorded primary spirits appear to have Indo-Iranian roots.\n\nNamely, Dazhbog, Khors, Stribog, Sintarg'l and Mokos.\n\nPRIMARY CHRONICLE\n\nIn addition toPerun , the highest god, andVo lo s, god of animals, theR us P rim ary\n\nChronicle( h e r e a ft e r Primary Chronicle)f o r 980 re fe rs to t h e godsDaz hbo g , K ho rs, S t ri bo g ,\n\nSimar'gl, zndMokosh.The g r e a t 1 2th c e n t u r y R u s s ia n e p i c ,S lo vo O P o lku Ig o revy e, Ig o ry a ,\n\nSinaS vy atoslavy a,V nukaO legova( T heT ale of the H ost ofIgor,Igor, the Sonof S vy atoslav, Grandsonof O leg)\n\nin addition toVo lo slVeles (veshei Bojane, Velesove vnuche), also mentions Dazhbog\n\n(pogibaset zhizn Dazhd-Bozha vnuka), Stribog (Se vjetri, Stribozi vnuci, vyut sa\n\nmoryastrelaminahrabriyapulklgorevi), Great [K]Hhors (velikornu Hrsovi vlkom\n\nput prerikase)and Troyan (risca ve troup Troyaniu cres polya na gori; na zemlyiu\n\nTroyaniu).1 A 12th century apocrypha detailing the activities and miracles of the blessed\n\nvirginalsom e n t i o n sPerun ,Vel es, K ho rs,and T ro y an( H oz hednie B ogoroditsiP o M ukam ).\n\nDAZHBOG\n\nAn early Slavic translation of the first universal Byzantine chronicle, an eighteen-\n\nbook world history( Chnnographia)b yJ o h n Malalas(4 9 0-5 78 ), identifiesD az hbo gusth e\n\nson ofSv aro g : Below Svarog, his son, the Sun, called Dazhbog ruled.\n\nDATBHAGA\n\nIn all ways, in name and role, the SlavicDaz hbo g , the giving god (the Sanskrit equivalent is Datbhaga) is consistent with the Indo-Iranian tradition, withS va ra s Dhata or Dhatabhaga, the creator of all things, with Svarog us Dazhbog, the solar source and\n\ndistributoro f wealth, health, a n d good fortune( V .J agic ,Z um Daz db og,A rC8 ,18 9 5 ; E .D ic kenm ann,\n\nSerbokroatische Dabog, ZsP 20, 1950).\n\nSUNWORSHIPERS\n\nIt is not surprising therefore that numerous authoritative sources identify the an- cient Slavs as Sun worshipers. The great 10th century Muslim historian, geographer, and cartographer, al-Mas'udi (896-956), theH erodotus o f the A rab s, for example, records that the Slavs had temples with special architectural arrangements, with an opening in the\n\ndomeforo b s e r v i n g t he sunrise( M urujadh- dhab abwa m a' adinal- jawahir).1 Certain that t hec o u rse\n\nof the Sun determined human affairs, the high priests prophesied future events by coor- dinating its course with precious stones and magic signs carved in stone inside the temple. It is a matter of record that solar reverence did not end with death. Wanting the dead to\n\nface thes u n r i s e , the pagan Slavs buried their dead with theh e a d in thew e s t,fe e t in the\n\neast.\n\nSORABOS, CULTUM SOUS\n\nA number of German historians are certain that the place name Juterbog is de-\n\nrivedf r o mt h e Serb wordsj u t r o o rm o r n i n g a n db ogotg o d ,f r o m p a g a nr i t u a l s c e l e b r a t -\n\ning the morning sun:Sorabos advenas ei tam cultum Soi ls . . . quern sua li ngua Jutre\n\nvocant, addito nomine Bog seu Boch, quod apud omnes Slavos Deum significant.\n\nSOLOTABAB\n\nIn some instances onomastic links with a pagan past have been obscured by\n\ntime and change. Who would suspect, for example, that the nameA usc hw itz is derived\n\nfromWosz wiec z ic h, a name denoting a place of solar celebrations:derivator Auscheweitus\n\na Sorabica voca Woszwieczicz = illuminate, de quyo sibie persuadebant vitam ab\n\neo servari.Some speculate that Bamberg( B am b erga—primum vocatafiiitBambergh.e.\n\nmons Babae), mons Babae, as well as many other Germania place names with the prefix\n\nbab- (e.g. Babin/1585, near Finsterwalde; Babizna/1378, near Dresden; Babic/1392, near Grimma; Babo/1458, near Cottbus;m ons B ab el12 2 3 , later Papenberge, near Spandau), were sites of pagan rituals relating toS olotaB ab .\n\nJUTROBOGIAPPELLATUR\n\nIn an early and outstanding study of the Serbs, A. Frencel writes: Slavi Sorabique\n\nfulgidam auroram sic interpretati sunt, quai esset numen praestantissimum, quod mortalibus in dies bene vellet, cupererque, quodque tenebras discuteret et diem largiertur, aptum tempus operibus agendis conficiendisque. Visa itaque Dea, a qua temperies et su dum coelum discussis fulminibus, tonitruis, fulguribus, ventorumque turbidinibus: ilium idolum, quod Soraborum persuasione primam diei facem accendret Jutrebobusseu Jutrobogi appellatur(A .F renc el,Com m entarius\n\nPhilologico-Historicus de Diis Soraborum Aliorumque Slavorum, 1719).\n\nSOLAR IMPULSE\n\nThat the solar impulse continued well into the Christian era is confirmed by\n\nmany sources. The Grand Duke of Kiev, Vladimir Monomakh (1052-1125), in his\n\ntestament, instructs his sons to praise the Lord first, and then the rising sun in the morn-\n\ning. Another sign of past times is found inThe Book of Deep Wisdom orGlub innaia\n\nKniga,a work popular in the late medieval period. In it Prince Vladimir has two basic\n\nquestions to King David:How did the White Light originate? How did the Sun\n\noriginate?King David answers: The White Light springs from God's heart; the\n\nSun, from God's face.\n\nSUNS ARE THE CREATORS\n\nParenthetically, L.M. Graham writes: Suns are the creators of the worlds, not gods. This the Ancients knew and it became the basis of their sun worship. Today we think of this as pagan ignorance of \"the one true God,\" but alas, the ignorance is ours, not theirs. The story is told of a Christian bishop who said to a Parsee: \"So you are one of those peculiar fellows who worship the sun.\" \"Yes,\" said the Parsee, \"and so would you if you had ever seen it.\" No, the bishop had never seen it mentally and so he worshiped a mythical Creator instead of the real one. And I'm sure he thought his form of worship vastly superior to the peculiar fellow's( Dec eptionsa n d M y ths of the Bible, 1975).\n\nAND THE BRIGHT SUN\n\nWhen the daughter of a Balkan Serb was getting married, writes F. Kmietowicz,\n\nit was customary for her father to instruct her in the same way as the Grand Duke of Kiev\n\ndid his son:To Pray to the righteous God and the bright sun in the east every\n\nmorning(F .K m ietowic z , S lavic M y thic al B eließ ,19 8 2 ).The same author writes that it waslo n g the\n\ncustom in Slavic lands:That when travellers and people in the field saw the rising\n\nsun, they stopped traveling or working, and standing upright they tooko ff their\n\nhats, bowing to the sun, they made crosses.Solar reverence was especially strong and\n\nenduring among the Christian Serbs of Germania, where it was the custom, upon\n\nentering a church, to turn around and greet the rising sun; it was forbidden to\n\npoint out the sun with the finger because, it was said, it could prick God's eye.\n\nHORS\n\nThe pagan Slav Sun godH o rs is a cognate of Vedics v a r , Old Persian,h va r as in\n\nhvar khsaeta( g l o r i o u s s u n god w i t h c h a r i o t a n d s w i ft s te e d s ), l a t e r Persian horsid( u n d y -\n\ning, shining sun). It it interesting and perhaps coincidental that in ancient Egyptian reli- gion, the sky godH or or H ar, in the form of a falcon, whose outstretched wings filled the heavens, whose eyes were the sun and the moon, was the god of gods. The First Dynasty, the unifiers of Egypt, wereH or worshipers. From that time, with occasional interrup- tions, every pharaoh was believed to be a human manifestation of Hor, and every pharaoh's first name wasH or. Coincidentally,o ra o is the Serbo-Croat word for eagle. Some schol- ars believe that the Croat ethnikon,Horvator Hrvat, like that of the kindred Serbs, is\n\nalso derived froms v a r fromh v a r fromh o r.\n\nHORS, HRSOJEVIC\n\nOne finds the given name ofH ors orH rs recorded in registers of late medieval Balkan Serb communities (e.g. the Hrs-Hrsojevic lineage of Zalaza-Njeguse, Katun county, in mid-16th century Old Montenegro).\n\nSIMURGH.ZAL\n\nThe Primary Chronicle'sSt m arg 'li s Si m urg h, the radiant bird-god of good omen, a creature of the Indo-Iranic pantheon where he is found with the very same name. While theS hah- Nam eh depictsSi m urg h as a noble vulture, the 'radiant bird' is generally de- picted as a composite creature made up of elements borrowed from the peacock, the lion, the griffin, and the dog. Under the influence of Indo-Iranian dynasts, the Hurrians gave the nameS im igi to a sun god who appears in various mythological compositions( V .\n\nPisani, Smarigla, Chorsa-Dazboga, For Roman Jakobson, 1956. B^A. Rybakov, Rusali andthe godSimargl-Pereplut, AnT\n\n6, 1968).\n\nSHAH-NAMEH\n\nZal is the sad, touching subject of a Persian epic poem Shah-Nameh (Book of the\n\nKings). Zal was born with pure white hair, and his frightened father, the noble Sam,\n\ngovernor of Hindustan, left the infant to his fate on a distant mountain. Hearing the infant's cries, the noble vultureSi m urg h takes Zal to his nest and raises him. Remorseful and heartbroken, Sam searches for Zal, finds him in early manhood, confesses his crime, and is forgiven by Zal, who begets the glorious and invincible Rustem.\n\nZAL, ZALITI, ZALOST\n\nIn Serb,z alas in zaliti, zalost, andz a ljen je is the root of words connoting regret,"
