The time period covered in this form will be the first 6 months of each grant (e.g. 1 January - 30 June of the current year). This form includes four sections, addressing grant metrics, program stories, financial information, and compliance. Please contact APG/FDC staff if you have questions about this form, or concerns submitting it by the deadline. After submitting the form, organizations will also meet with APG staff to discuss their progress.\n\nWe are trying to understand the overall outcomes of the work being funded across our grantees' programs.

This is your chance to tell your story by using any additional metrics (beyond global metrics) that are relevant to your context, beyond the global metrics above. You should be reporting against the targets you set at the beginning of the year throughout the year. We have provided a template here below for you to report against your targets, but you are welcome to include this information in another way. Also, if you decided not to do a program that was included in your proposal or added a program not in the proposal, please explain this change. More resources for storytelling are at the end of this form. Here are some ways to tell your story.\n\nWe encourage you to share your successes and failures and what you are learning. Please also share why are these successes, failures, or learnings are important in your context.

Note that, among other things, any changes must be consistent with our WMF mission, must be for charitable purposes as defined in the grant agreement, and must otherwise comply with the grant agreement.\n\nThere were no significant deviations.\n\nAre you in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations as outlined in the grant agreement? Please answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nYes.\n\nAre you in compliance with provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), and with relevant tax laws and regulations restricting the use of the Grant funds as outlined in the grant agreement? Please answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nYes.\n\nOnce complete, please sign below with the usual four tildes.\n\nMickey Mystique (talk) 15:09, 30 July 2021 (UTC)\n\nGlobal metrics are an important starting point for grantees when it comes to measuring programmatic impact (Learning Patterns and Tutorial) but don’t stop there.\n\nLogic Models provide a framework for mapping your pathway to impact through the cause and effect chain from inputs to outputs to outcomes. Develop a logic model to map out your theory of change and determine the metrics and measures for your programs.\n\nImportantly, both qualitative and quantitative measures are important so consider both as you determine measures for your evaluation and be sure to ask the right questions to be sure to capture your program stories."
