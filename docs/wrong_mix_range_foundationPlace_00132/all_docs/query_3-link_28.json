        "text": "Ово је део мог приватног досијеа о Сорошу и његовим \"инвестицијама\" у Србији. У питању је 1998. година. Понављам, у питању је само део.\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS\n\nThe program concentrated on the following issues: protection of rights of refugees, protection of women and children rights, protection of rights of marginalized groups (sexual minorities, groups with additional needs), problem of violence in society and its prevention, as well as the violation of so-called political rights of citizens.\n\nWitnessing a general radicalization of society and sharp turn in the direction of traditionalism and small town conservatism, where victims of human rights violations are all segments of society who think or act \"differently\" and represent \"otherness\", the Fund will continue to provide support to projects arguing that allowance, neglect or avoidance of human rights violations in any given segment is equally dangerous and damaging and could contribute to further radicalization.\n\nIn this context, significant section of the program was dedicated to demarginalization or extremely marginalized groups which are and generally closed within themselves and \"labeled\" by the outside, so-called \"normal\" world. This is particularly true of homosexuals and persons with additional needs. Having in mind that homophobia is a form of social prejudice that is most rooted and least open to extermination in all traditional societies such as ours, and while the studies of homosexual community and subculture, as well as constructions of homosexuality in the public discourse are for a long time legitimate topics of scientific production elsewhere in the world, this issue is visibly absent in Yugoslavia. The project in this field included public reactions to cases of expressed homophobia, through statements, articles and visits, as well as through adequate legal means in cases of extreme homophobia.\n\nAs far as the groups with additional needs are concerned, projects submitted by their associations only exceptionally insist on demarginalization and equal treatment, and generally limit themselves to activities for the improvement of quality of existence within a secluded group.\n\nA significant segment of the program was aimed at projects dealing with the issues of rights of victims in the environment where the number of violent criminal offences is on the rapid increase. The projects in this field tried to find the ways to ease the consequences of criminality and help citizens to protect themselves.\n\nAnother active dimension of this program in 1998 was education on human rights and for human rights. We have supported education seminars for tolerance, specialized education programs for integration of refugees, education consciousness awareness seminars on the problem of violence against children and youth in Kosovo, a conference on conscientious objection in Yugoslavia, project on Roma women's rights, etc.\n\nProjects awarded with support\n\n1.

Roads of Integration and Tolerance\n\nGrantee: Humanitarian Center for Integration and Tolerance, Novi Sad\n\nThe project's target group were refugees from Bosnia and Croatia who, as a result of war operations, fled to Vojvodina.

support to various aspects of culture through several categories (in-country touring, cultural events, competitions and festivals, alternative centers network, multimedia programs) and three network cultural programs (Open Society Cultural Link, Performing Arts Network Program and Arts Link). The focus was mainly on the work of independent artists and institutions, whose programs were dealing with new creative forms and helped in their broader development and penetration into cultural life of the country.\n\nThe support in establishment and work of the independent cultural centers has proved to be one of the most important achievements of this program. Cinema Rex and Center for Cultural Decontamination from Belgrade and Apostrof from Novi Sad developed their respective programs with the support of the Fund and became the leading cultural institutions in the country, gathering all independent cultural initiatives from the field of theater, film, music, multimedia and literature. Center for Cultural Decontamination was the only Yugoslav representative at the Stockholm Cultural Capital of Europe, Cinema Rex became the full member of the Trans Europe Halles network of the alternative cultural centers and the Association Apostrof developed a unique International Video Art Festival in the country. With the support of the Program a new cultural center was established in Priština, the Open Art House, which will enable broader cultural activities in Kosovo.\n\nIn 1998, the Arts and Culture Program initiated a new “in-country touring” program\n\nwhich focused on cooperation and exchange of cultural programs between the cultural capitals and the local communities. Its aim was to provoke more experimental programs in the local community and represent the achievements of independent institutions and artists, who can hardly reach out to the broader audience in the country.\n\nThanks to the Open Society Cultural Link Network Program, the 32nd BITEF had participants from Central and Eastern Europe.

It is very encouraging to stress that almost all of these organizations managed to survive and develop numerous activities even when the initial enthusiasm of the protest was gone. The Fund for an Open Society supported these activities both directly, financially, but also indirectly – with the help of the Center for the Development of Nonprofit Sector, an NGO \"umbrella\" organization which facilitated the process of establishing these organizations and helped them find their place in the NGO field as relevant forces and activists at the local level.\n\nThe NGO Development program in 1998 paid particular attention to the projects submitted by local nongovernment organizations from smaller out-of-capital regions. These smaller grassroot organizations which emerged on the NGO scene since 1996/97 continued to offer quality and well-structured projects, focusing their interest on the actual problems of the local community. The effect of supporting these organizations is manifold: the organizations themselves are strengthened and they gain self-confidence and readiness to, in a more serious and focused way work on their projects. Also, the local community is given the possibility to engage in some processes of change, rethink some stereotypes and widen its perspectives.\n\nOn of the focal points of the NGO Development program in 1998 was widening the activities of the Center for the Development of Nonprofit Sector. This NGO continued to spread its influence and activities throughout FRY in 1998. One of the most successful projects supported this year was the First NGO Forum, which brought together representatives of all NGOs in the country. The Forum opened many burning issues in the field of NGO activities, and was a unique opportunity to evaluate the NGO sector since the \"awakening\" of this sphere in FRY. By the end of the year, NGOs in Montenegro held their own NGO Forum, focusing on specific issues in a different, much less hostile environment of Montenegro. One of the spin-off effects of the Forum was to bring together a few NGOs from Serbia and Vojvodina to set up a multidisciplinary project \"NGOs – the Sector of the Future\".\n\nFollowing the very successful model of the Center for the Development of Nonprofit Sector, we have supported the establishment of the Center for the Development of Civil Society in Priština. This organization will serve as an \"umbrella\" NGO for wide ranging civil initiatives in Kosovo. We also hope to see many more NGO activities in Kosovo and believe that the setting up of the Center for the Development of Civil Society will inspire other local organizations to come forward, articulate their programs and strengthen the very fragile civil society network in Kosovo.\n\nIn this context, the Center for the Development of Nonprofit Sector in FRY plans to in 1999 open a few regional offices (in Podgorica, Vršac and Kragujevac) to support local NGO networks.\n\nProjects awardes with support:\n\n1. Promotion Workshop: Incubation Model Center\n\nGrantee: District 0230, Kikinda\n\nThe grant supported the project aimed at animation, education and solidarity of citizens of Kikinda to develop entrepreneurship and self-employment.\n\nAward: $5,013.96\n\n2.

First Forum of Non Government Organizations\n\nGrantee: Fund Center for Democracy, Belgrade\n\nThe first Forum of nongovernment organizations was held in Belgrade, on June 11-13, 1998 with 140 national NGO representatives and 10 international nonprofit organizations participating. The Forum was organized by the Center for the Development of Nonprofit Sector (Belgrade), Fund Center for Democracy (Belgrade) and Open University (Subotica). The reason behind the organization of the Forum was the belief in the necessity of bringing Yugoslav nongovernment organizations together, for a variety of reasons. As the number of NGOs in Yugoslavia is constantly increasing, especially in small local communities, the need was identified for their closer cooperation, exchange of experiences and networking. Also, having in mind the current level of nonprofit sector's development, the organizers were of opinion that it was necessary to examine the basic systematic, status, legal and organizational problems nongovernment organizations are facing in their work and to offer concrete solutions.\n\nAward: $42,678.17\n\n6.
