LACRIMOSA LYRICS

Elodia (1999)

1. Am Ende Der Stille

[English translation:]

[At The End Of Silence]

your words glide into the morning

in a frail pink veil

that rises above nature

they fade and hush silence

only the longing in my voice

in fleeing prayer

remembers your words

in wich you put me

so my hope is hushed

and the silence starts war

2. Alleine Zu Zweit

[English translation:]

[Together Alone]

At the end of truth

At the end of light

At the end of love

At the end - there are you

(The heart empties - there goes a part of me )

Nothing has survived

We have parted in silence long ago

And with every day of 'us'

grew the lie of our love

And the further we went on our path together

The further we have grown apart

Lonely - together

We have forgotten to find us a new

Habit gaggs

Dullness suffocates

Arrogance makes you drunk

and closeness drives to flight

Dance - my life - dance

Dance with me

dance with me again

into the pure flush of naked love

If I see him/her like this

If I experience him/her

If I watch us

Something survived

And when I find strength and hope

If I could believe in us

If I could reach him/her

Have him/her for myself once more

If the base - our foundation

If we could explore us once again

If he/she only wanted

I will !

3. Halt Mich

[English translation:]

[Hold Me]

awoken from sleepless daydreams

I am longings victim

awoken from childish trust

my wounds dehinsce

life burns from my soul

the longing bravely fullfills its duty

Hold me- my life- hold me

As long as time still moves

the needles still turn

so long I will do my rounds

but lifes sweet lust has left me

life burns from my soul

the longing bravely fullfills its duty

Hold me- my life- hold me

4. The Turning Point

Poutaisat pilvet haihtuvat katoen nopesti tuulten mukana kuin tama uni

Jossa en enaa sinua tavoita on liian myohaista

In a dream I saw the world beyond - no tongues telling lies

The silence was covering everything inside

In a dream I saw myself - fallen down next to me

Couldn't crawl back inside my body

No laughter on my face - reality mirrored in the deep signs of life

Too long sacrificed my feelings to the ones

Who take all 'till there's nothing in the end

I'm not in my aim - I've gotta love also the other half of me

To reach the Turning point

As only in my dreams I'm my biggest enemy

Till I'd found out that I only loved your half in me

So much time I spent - not knowing myself

Too much love I'd given for everyone but nothing for me

My light was burning 'till the end

Now you showed me that two full halves make a stronger one

Also out of me and I feel the strength

Returning into me I new-found love again

Couldn't have been fighting alone

Thank you for hearing me on time

I bless you for the trust you gave

When I didn't admit being weak

I am close to my aim truly hoping

I won't fail

Before I reach The turning point

Where we're no longer the same

Didn't notice me change

Was not living the days without names

Now I'm here with you

To stay beyond

The turning point

Of my dreams

O found my aim - now I can face myself

Again

I thank you for

Loving me

And keeping us on the right way

5. Ich Verlasse Heut Dein Herz

[English translation:]

[Today I Leave Your Heart]

Today I leave your heart

Today I leave your heart

leave your closeness

the asylum of your arms

the warmth of your skin

We were like children

Players - Night for night

Faithfully loyal to the mirror

So we danced until daylight

Today I leave your heart

leave your closeness

I leave your tears

leave what I have

I order your heart today

To life - to freedom

And to love

So I am calm-

Because I love you

In silence

I let off of you

The last kiss- drifting in the mind

What you are thinking, you will owe me

What I feel I owe you

I thank you for all the love

I thank you eternally

Today I leave your heart

leave your love

I leave your heart

Your life - Your kisses

Your warmth - Your closeness

Your tenderness

6. Dichzu Toten Fiel Mir Schwer

[English translation:]

[Killing You Was Hard]

And there was barely air

And there was barely space

And there was no longing

And thats all I have left

I have to get out- I have to geet away

But still - I search for you

The life I never found

The life - my refugee

I have cursed you

To later, and much deeper

try the kiss

You light of my soul

And now about you

My ill brain

Conserved in the juices of time

I gave you the blood from my heart

Fed you with senses power

Over much I let you rule

Gave you even power above my doing

I gave you love-

My trust

My friend-

You hurt me-

But still-

It's not over yet

I still hear

Your breath

I still see

Your shaking hands

The memory beginns to live

Starts to skipe me again

And to conquer my heart in silence

My heart - you brave pain

You kept me alive

You beat me in pain

And I still can't understand it

I still see the glance in your eyes

The shaking of your body

But the killing was hard

Yes - the killing was hard

Today your name sounds like an empty book

Like a never fullfilled promise

To kill you was hard

Yes - the killing was hard

For a short time you were the light

You were my gate to the world

So you lie in your own juice now

and you die slowly

out of me

7. Sanctus

[English translation:]

[Sanctus]

Sanctus - Sanctus - Sanctus - Dominus

Deus deus Sabaoth - pleni sunt caeli et terra

Gloria tura - gloria tura

And there you were

Not in the light that surrounded you

No - In the shadow I made

I recognised you

Gloria tua - gloria tua

And we fell - together

And we finally became one

In colours made

In pictures thought

In life awoken

In hearts new grown

Light and love

Diving deep into the night

Hasanna in excelsis

Benedictus qui venit in nomine domini

Sanctus dominus

8. Am Ende Stehen Wir Zwei

[English translation:]

[We Two Stand At The End]

No compromises,

No silent tears,

No kisses which taste

Guides me to you,

No repetitions,

No deceit, no painfull touch from the past,

Only the hope of a second chance.

Thats all what's left for us,

A second chance for you

And me, a second chance for us.

You dont have to say anything now.

Don't have to love me. I have hope for us.

Because at the end we two stand.

Music drifts from far away to me.

Strange.

I don't recognise you anymore.

Your love stays holy for me.

Your life has fled.

A goodbye without end.

A crusade in your heart.

A love without borders.

A warmth without light.

So you are lieing cold and motionless.

And you still warm my heart.

My hope shall guide me through the days without you.

And love shall carry me when Pain and hope break.

9. Und Du Fallst

[japanese bonus track]

[English translation:]

[And You Fall]

And I raise this feather

And feel my written words

And I thank and I hear

And drown wholly in you

And the lies of your eyes

And you laugh and so they fall

And as master in the conversation

Your words are wet and empty

And your voice carries no light

nor hope nor truth

only the bridge and the intermediary

for the blindness of this world

So you are alone in me

And I am alone in you

And all think and lose

their spirit in this world

Lost blind - dead

so lost - confused and clear

You think to live for understanding

Determined - reasonably hard

But deep and true - but rather empty

And as a servant of this world

you follow the glaring light of lie

And the colors of true love

You dont feel and see and know

Whipped in dark night

Alone in the rain you awake

The soul burns your heart fades

And you yet not realize

So the sense reacts and errs

In the labyrinth of security

where the search in itself

Where begins honesty?

4. Skintight

Your eyes don't want to see

The beauty right in front of you,

'Cause your mind can't stand

The beauty right in front of you,

And your veins explode for

The beauty right in front of you,

When your body screams

For the softness of her milk-white skin.

And then you drop

Down to your knees

When she enters your world,

As she opens her lips

Skintight -- This is as close as you can get

And all it took was just one word

Skintight in all of my grace

From her to conquer you

In all of my grace

And all it took was just one look at her

I am the world

And you would follow her

I am success

And yet you know she did not speak to you

Money -- beauty -- that's me

She didn't see you though

Fever -- lust -- watch me

And when she leaves the room

You will feel alone and you will feel ashamed.

And then you drop

I'm -- all that you wish

Down to your knees

I am -- all that you need

When she enters your world

Watch -- but don't touch

As she opens her lips!

Skintight -- This is as close as you can get

5. Road To Pain

Why the **** does beauty hurt?

Why the **** does beauty lead to pain?

In both ways it ends in pain

Anyway - give me your beauty now

Anyway - blow my veins

Curse me and riddle me

The road to pain is paved by beauty

Oh - you incredible road

I don`t want to walk `where else

I can`t beat you - since I can`t beat beauty

I only can scream in ecstasy:

Praise the beauty and praise the pain

Double feature beauty is double feature pain

Whether I can take it

Or I`m damned to bleed

And blood can taste so sweet

Praise the beauty and praise the pain

Things to watch from afar

Are simply not to be touched

How much can you destroy

By getting yet to close

Oh - you incredible road

I don`t want to walk `where else

I can`t beat you - since I can`t beat beauty

I only can scream in ecstasy:

Praise the beauty and praise the pain

Double feature beauty! is double feature pain

Whether I can take it

Or I`m damned to bleed

And blood can taste so sweet

So beautiful your body

So beautiful your face

Your voice is tender soft

And velvet is your skin

Only your words are a little week

Since your mind is kind of narrow

As your movements are little funny

Since you are trying to fake your nature

Trying to be a star

Growing in shallow adaptations

By loosing your nature given power:

Praise the beauty and praise the pain
