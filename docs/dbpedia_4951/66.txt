Harald Zwart – 2001

One Night At McCools is a really bizarre little film with a great cast (Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser, John Goodman and Michael Douglas) and some very funny moments.

A wonderful feel and a good pace keeps the energy levels high. No one takes themselves too seriously and they fully embrace the film’s out-there tone. Michael Douglas is great as always in a supporting role and the Falling Down reface is a nice addition. The final showdown to the YMCA is fun too!
