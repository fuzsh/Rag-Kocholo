        "text": "This is my list from RossHoss’s blog. Just something to break the ice….\n\nMinority Report and Collateral Cruise is a nut-case in real life but a great actor. Like the Bourne movies, I can watch either of these over and over and always be happy doing it. Collateral also features Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinket Smith.\n\nBlade I’m definitely not a horror-movie fan but I love this one. Features good-guy, vampire-himself. vampire killer, muscled up, ripped Wesley Snipes in sweet, cool shades driving a bare-bones sweet, also muscled-up 1968 Dodge Charger (shown above, but shiny black not flat like Blade’s).\n\nFrom Dusk till Dawn Cult classic, classic Tarintino movie that morphs into something else entirely. Crazy, crazy. Lots of laughs too. A definite hit for the Sunday night, after church, Deacons movie night. Warning on the language though.\n\nMongol Brand new, just out on DVD, story of the life of Genghis Khan. Beautifully shot, acted, and scripted. Great story of loyalty, and love of clan and family. War scenes are very brutal, can be slow at times and in sub-titles, but I still recommend highly.\n\nThe first two Bourne ’s. Skip the 3rd one: Bourne Ultimatum which is just a re-run of all the coolest stuff in the first two. But those are awesome.Identity is prob my favorite all time movie ever.\n\nThe first two Matrix movies. Again, if you haven’t seen the last and 3rd one, skip it. It’s beyond horrible. The first two though, are beyond awesome.\n\nMask, Ace Ventura Pet Detective and When Nature Calls. My George of the Jungles. Jim Carrey can get on your nerves after a while but I can watch these anytime.\n\nTalledega Nights I pretty much hate Will Ferrell movies but this one is just so dad-gummed FUNNY. Witness the ” saying grace scene” : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuAUI_0knfk\n\nFrequency A good, macho, thriller, great story, tear-jerker. Something for everybody.\n\nTroy Almost as good as Gladiator. Not quite, but not far.\n\nMy Cousin Vinny One of those few movies that I probably know just about every line by heart (only other two-Oh Brother Where Art Thou, and Tombstone) Get the Wal Mart version or a similarly edited version though, the language is surprisingly rough."
