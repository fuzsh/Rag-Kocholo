        "text": "Quotes • Headscratchers • Playing With • Useful Notes • Analysis • Image Links • Haiku • Laconic\n\nTed: So, Captain, how'd you get that name anyway?\n\nThe Captain: Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name.\n\nTed: Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.\n\nGet lost, John Smith, here comes Johnathan Q. Public. Sometimes, people grow up with boring names, and they imagine more exciting and exotic names for themselves. If you let this person write a piece of fiction, expect this flair for the exotic to show up in a lot of their characters. Try to imagine this person as a baby or as a toddler and everyone calling them this. Try to imagine the parents who would name them this.\n\nThe story is set in a modern-day city, where everyone inexplicably has \"cool\" names. There's no one named Bill, Todd, or John. It's all \"Anubis\", \"Scar\", \"Bullet\", \"Diamond\", etc. Even better if these aren't nicknames, but their actual given names. It can double up as a Meaningful Name.\n\nWhen a video game lets you do this to the characters you control, it's called Hello, Insert Name Here.\n\nThe opposite of Unfortunate Names and Fail O'Suckyname, while Plain Name lies in between these two.\n\nLuke Nounverber and Johnny McCoolname are Sub Tropes.\n\nCompare Theme Naming, Prophetic Names.\n\nSee also Names to Run Away From Really Fast, Xtreme Kool Letterz, Punctuation Shaker, My Nayme Is, Aerith and Bob, Law of Alien Names and Who Names Their Kid \"Dude\"?.\n\nExamples of Awesome McCoolname include:\n\nPeople with Awesome/Cool Names[]\n\nAdvertising[]\n\nA Fed-Ex features a Witness Protection man who is given the name Eric Gustafson. Unfortunately he gets it taken away and becomes Paul Matheson\n\nCaptain Horatio Magellan Crunch, known to most as simply Cap'n Crunch.\n\nAnime and Manga[]\n\nDaz Bones from One Piece.\n\nYou'd think Gold Roger would have been his bounty name, but no, his name is actually Gol D. Roger.\n\nOther cool people have a \"D\" middle name like Monkey D. Luffy or Portgas D. Ace. Considering Ace was Roger's son, he could be called \"Gol D. Ace\". Gold Ace? Yes.\n\nThe One Piece world is rife with these: Trafalgar Law, Boa Hancock, Roranoa Zoro (recursive transliteration of L'Ollonais Zorro), Fisher Tiger, Nefertiti Cobra, Bartholomew Kuma, San Juan Wolf, Jesus Burgess, Avolo Pizarro...\n\nCowboy Bebop has a number of examples, though various characters might be living under aliases:\n\nSpike Spiegel. When asked if Spike was Jewish due to his last name, the creators responded that they just thought it sounded cool.\n\nJet Black, an obvious color pun.\n\nVicious, the ruthless crimelord.\n\nAsimov Solensan, the bounty head in the first episode.\n\nFaye Valentine, the sexpot. Faye's first name is apparently not an alias, since it is used by a childhood friend.\n\nEd claims that her full name is Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, but it's really just Françoise.\n\nFrançoise Appledelhi is still a pretty cool name.\n\nMartian Successor Nadesico. \"Jiro Yamada is just the boring old name my mother gave me. Gai Daigoji is the name that belongs to my soul!!!\"\n\nDragon Ball Z gives us Satan Hercule, professional martial artist and strongest human not to use Ki attacks. His real name is Mark.\n\nMobile Suit Gundam 00: Hank Hercules is the man with the name you'd love to touch. But you mustn't touch!.\n\nThe Innovators' names may also apply, if the Engrish doesn't ruin them for you, as witness decently cool names like \"Bring Stability\" and \"Healing Care\" turned into \"Bring Stabity\" and \"Hilling Care\".\n\n\"Bring Stabbity\" would be quite cool.\n\nOn the topic of Gundam, Athrun Zala, Lacus Clyne, Tieria Erde, Stella Loussier, Allelujah Haptism, Sumeragi Lee Noriega, Zeon Zum Daikun, Casval Rem Daikun, Dozle Zabi, Mafty Navilles Erin, Seabook Arno, Anavel Gato, South Burning, Suberoa Zinnerman, Angelo Sauper, Cardias Vist, Daguza Mackle, Garrod Ran, Iselina Eschenbach, Bright Noa, Yazan Gable, Apolly Bay, Helm Compass, the list goes on....\n\nBut all of these pale compared to Master Asia. Seriously, the Japanese version implies that's his actual name (when Domon calls him master, he uses an entirely different word).\n\nIt turns out that his real name is Shuji Kurosu, and Master Asia is a nickname based on his title, \"Undefeated of the East\". You wouldn't know this from watching the series, though.\n\nThese names often mix into Narm territory as well. I mean, where else can you make the names Quattro Bajeena, Jamitov Hyman and Full Frontal work out?\n\nWell full frontal can refer to a full on assault, so it also doubles as a shout out to the missing-in-action Char Aznable's combat style so its still epic.\n\nIn contrast to the relatively normal Shinigami names in Bleach, the Gratuitous Spanish names of the Arrancar gave us such gems as Grimmjow Jeagerjaquez, Coyote Starrk, Gantenbainne Mosqueda, Wonderweiss Margera and Ulquiorra Cifer.\n\nRelatively normal names? Yasutora = \"peaceful tiger\", Uryuu = \"rain dragon\", Toushirou = \"winter lion\", Rangiku = \"war chrysanthemum\", Retsu = \"fierce\"... Plus there are a number of puns where the pronunciation evokes a special imagery even though the kanji are different. \"Byakuya\" = \"midnight sun\", Urahara = \"reverse\", Aizen = \"gentle calmness\", etc.\n\nAnd this goes double for the zanpakutou whose names are either incredibly cool (\"MOON SLAYER\"), incredibly weird or, mostly, incredibly silly.\n\nInuyasha gives us yet another Byakuya (\"Midnight Sun\", as mentioned above),Magatsuhi (\"God of Destruction\") Bankotsu (\"Reckless Courage\"), Naraku (\"Hell\"), and, the one who doubtlessly takes the cake, Sesshomaru (\"Deathly Perfection\" or \"Circle of Death\"). The latter three are as Badass as you'd expect.\n\nInuyasha himself qualifies — the meaning is nowhere near as awesome as the others, but a name that means \"Dog Demon\" has some cool points going for it.\n\nFrom Soul Eater we have Soul Eater Evans, and not to mention, Black☆Star (The star symbol is literally in his name). Death the Kid also deserves a mention here.\n\nHow about Spirit, Maka's dad — also commonly known as Death Scythe?\n\nYou can't forget Marie Mjolnir.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist is a testament to awesome naming. Names like Roy Mustang, Riza Hawkeye, King Bradley, Jean Havoc, Kain Fuery, Vato Falman, Van Hohenheim and Basque Grand make children wish their parents had thought of them first. And that's only a fraction of them.\n\nVan Hohenheim's name comes from real-life Philip von Hohenheim, also called Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim, or Paracelsus for short.\n\nBonus points go to Kain Fuery, whose name is especially awesome despite the fact that he is a glasses-wearing techie geek.\n\n\"Edward Elric\" has a nice ring to it too.\n\n\"Winry Rockbell\" also has a certain greatness to it as well.\n\nOf course, Jean Havoc and Basque Grand sound terribly boring to French ears.\n\nTHIS NAME HAS BEEN IN THE ARMSTRONG LINE FOR GENERATIONS!\n\nFun Fact: All the military personnel in the series are named after military vehicles or weapons from World War I to The Vietnam War.\n\nTrigun: \"I am known as Valentinez Alkalinella Xifax Schidabohertz Gombigobilla Blue Stradivari Talentrent Anita Hore Pierre Aundre Charton Haymoss Ivanovici Baldeus George Doitzel Kaiser III. Don't hesitate to call.\"\n\nNot actually an example, though. Millions Knives, though? Oh come on.\n\nLegato Bluesummers.\n\nAnd even then, Vash the Stampede is a pretty boss name.\n\nRight until you realize the French \"vache\" means \"cow\".\n\nCyborg 009 has G.B., short for \"Great Britain\".\n\nBaccano! can be a bit weird about this, as many characters have relatively normal names (Eve, Rachel, Isaac, Keith) while some can be weird enough to make you look twice (Ladd, Luck, Nice) — and then there's the timid, unassuming little guy who somehow wound up with the name Jacuzzi Splot. The jury's still out on whether this is the worst name in the world, or if it goes all the way out the other side and back into AWESOME.\n\nMacross has Maximilian Jenius.\n\nLight Yagami in Death Note. Several character remark what an unusual name it is, though it's never explained why his parents chose it. The creator said he just thought it sounded interesting, and discouraged trying to find hidden meanings.\n\nIt does, coincidentally, mean that the trope Light Is Not Good apply to his character by name as well as by his alignment.\n\nJiggy Pepper in Letter Bee.\n\nAlso Dr. Thunderland Jr. It's not sufficient enough that his surname is Thunderland, he's also a doctor.\n\nIn Neon Genesis Evangelion, Asuka Langley Soryuu, a.k.a. Asuka Langley Shikinami.\n\nAlso, Mari Illustrious Makinami.\n\nIkari Gendo has a nice ring to it. So does Fuyutsuki Kozo (whose family name literally means \"winter moon\" and was, like many of the Eva characters, named after a battleship)\n\nMahou Sensei Negima — Evangeline Athanasia Katherine (Kitty) McDowell and Fate Averruncus. The last one picked the name himself; as a construct, his real name is simply Tertium, or Third.\n\nIncidentally, Evangeline's last name is an anglicization of the Gaelic phrase for Child of the Dark Stranger.\n\nCode Geass has Lelouch Lamperouge, Jeremiah Gottwald and Bismarck Waldstein. Kallen Stadtfeld doesn't sound too shabby either.\n\nKallen can go so far as to change it at will to \"Kallen/Karen Kozuki\". Meanwhile, there is also the awesomeness that is Gilbert G.P. Guilford. And if you look at most Britannian names in general, take a look at Euphie's list of \"approved\" Knight choices, given to her by Cornelia. One guy is actually called Baron Schutenkin Gordiengo The Third]].\n\nWhat, no love for Villetta Nu?\n\nHellsing: Alucard, Seras Victoria and — infamously — Sir Integra Wingates Hellsing (who is a woman, incidentally).\n\nThat's Sir Integra Fairbrooke Wingates Hellsing to you.\n\nZorin Blitz and Heinkel Wolfe have some rad names too.\n\nMagnos the Robot gives us the main villain, Xerxes Tire-Iron Dada.\n\nThe Clueless Detective Gai Kurosawa in Darker than Black calls himself that because he thinks it sounds cooler than his real name. It doesn't really work.\n\nA lot of the names in D.Gray-man qualify as this or Foreign Sounding Gibberish, particularly Generals Klaud Nine, Cross Marian, and Winters Socalo. The rest of the cast aren't slackers, though, giving us Reever Wenham, Noise Marie, Daisya Barry, Arystar Krory, Road and Sherrill Kamelot, Tyki Mikk, Jasdero and Devit, Skinn Bolic... Well, you get the idea.\n\nThe supreme king of this trope in DGM is the Black Order's doorman, Ares Teena = dloe = gynosan = P = ruporson = gear = Amadeus 5th.\n\nEureka (pronounced \"eh-oo-reh-kah\"), Anemone, Holland, and Moondoggie in Eureka Seven.\n\nNaruto\n\nKiller Bee of Kumogakure. The \"Killer\" part may just be something he added on himself while his real name may just be B(ee).\n\nNaruto Uzumaki = Spiral Whirlpool\n\nKakashi Hatake = Scarecrow Farmland\n\nMinato Namikaze. I forget if his first name means anything, but his family name is something like combines the words for \"sea\" and \"wind\". (His first name means \"port\", as in the place where ships go).\n\nKisame warrants mention, as the only thing his name can mean is \"Demon Shark\", which you really have to question anyone really having, even if it is appropriate.\n\nRock Lee and Might Guy.\n\nGamabunta, the boss toad\n\nZabuza means \"Never cuts twice\". He's an assassin by the way.\n\nMagic Knight Rayearth has some pretty badass names if you sit to think about it! While Hikaru may sound like a rather generic name — Hikaru Shidou translates into Light of the Lion Shrine. Umi Ryuuzaki means Dragon of the Sea. Fuu Hououji means Wind of the Phoenix King Shrine. Just take a moment to imagine introducing yourself that way in society~\n\nEveryone else — and I do mean everyone — is named after CARS! CARS PEOPLE! Lantis (Mazda Lantis), Zagato (an Italian automotive design studio), Clef (Mazda Clef) and Emeraude (Mitsubishi Emeraude) are just a few examples!\n\nKuroe Kurose from Blood Alone. The \"kuro\" part of the name means \"black\".\n\nMikado Ryugamine from Durarara!!, whose name roughly means \"Emperor of the Dragon's Peak\", and I'll be damned if that doesn't qualify for this trope. It sticks out enough to be lampshaded by a few characters.\n\nThere's also a later case in the novels, where Kasuka thinks it's cute to name his kitten Yuigadokusonmaru (which, removing the common name suffix of -maru, means \"only I am holy.\")\n\nVan Flyheight from Zoids.\n\nHanma Baki, literally \"the Wild Fang\". Son of Hanma Yuujiro, nicknamed \"The strongest creature of the Earth\". Baki said at least once that not even AIDS nor cancer would be able to defeat his dad.\n\nRurouni Kenshin has the Hitokiri Battōsai (Himura Kenshin) and The Wolf of Mibu (Saitō Hajime).\n\n\"Hitokiri\" was a title/name given to the assassins of the Ishin shishi, for Kenshin they added \"Battōsai\" since he was a master of the class of sword techniques known as \"Battō-jutsu\" which may roughly translate as \"shredder/ripper\" -he deserved it, but since \"The shredder assassin\" didn't make him sound much like justice, during his prime people added the title \"he who makes blood rain\", he later says he holds no attachment to that name.\n\nHis name, as a elite killer from Millennion, was Brandon Heat. Then he was killed. And later, resurrected. Call him by his nickname, Grave. Of course, his given name is now Beyond. Gungrave's Beyond the Grave, possibly the badassest name ever seen.\n\nRocketbilly Redcadillac, from the second game. These guys know their stuff.\n\nBalladbird Lee.\n\nBear Walken. Makes sense, as this series and Trigun share the same creator.\n\nThe main character of Outlaw Star is named Gene Starwind. There are people who'd kill for a name that cool.\n\nKnight Schumacher from Future GPX Cyber Formula. With a name for a very fast driver, It sounds like a pretty cool name.\n\nHis (Secret Identity) name is modeled after Michael Schumacher because the producers of the show thought that it sounded like a fitting name for a fast driver.\n\nWolfgang Grimmer from Monster. It's not his real name, though.\n\nVery common with Japanese names in anime and manga. Due to reasons explained in the Real Life section they can be difficult to translate, but unlike in Real Life, many anime/manga authors are going for a specific meaning when naming their characters.\n\nSpeed Racer. Lots of good names in the American dub. Ace Deucey, Cruncher Block, Mr. Fixer, Inspector Detector, Ivonna von Vondervon, Lightfingers Klepto, Professor Anarchy, Rock Force, Rudolph Elegantor, Skull Duggery, Snake Oiler, Splint Femur, Zoomer Slick.\n\nBlack★Rock Shooter. Her enemy also sport the equally cool name Dead Master.\n\nIt doesn't stop there. The other characters in artbooks include Black★Devil Girl, Black★Gold Saw, and Dragon Slayer. These are not nicknames.\n\nBlack Lagoon, due to practically every character being Only Known by Their Nickname, does this. The crowning example is probably Lotton the Wizard, who almost certainly picked the name to try to make himself sound cooler.\n\nFairy Tail is full of them. Natsu Dragneel/Dragion, Gray Fullbuster/Surge, Erza Scarlett/Knightwalker, Zeref, Gildartz, Ren Akatsuki, Makarov, Laxus, Gajeel Redfox, Juvia, Levy, Hades, and Zancrow.\n\nAnd with the newest chapter, we have Bluenote Stinger.\n\nYu-Gi-Oh!s Maximillion J. Pegasus deserves mention for sure. (Despite the difficulty in hearing/saying it without snickering.)\n\nHis successor is no worse off, him being called Chronos de Medici.\n\nMotoko Kusanagi. That's like being called Girl Caliburn, or Girl Excalibur, because Motoko is a girl's name meaning \"child\", and the Kusanagi (literally \"grass-cutter\") is a sword of Japanese legend. The Kusanagi is essentially equivalent to Excalibur.\n\nDude. Guts. GUTS.\n\nIn Persona 4 The Animation, the MC is named Yu Narukami. Narukami can be translated as a Thunder God, which is cool in itself but also significant because his primary Persona, Izanagi, is lightning oriented.\n\nAxis Powers Hetalia's Sweden. His human name is Berwald Oxenstierna. Roughly translated, that's Berwald Oxstar. He WAS once a Viking...\n\nBuso Renkin has the ultimate life form, Victor Powered and (though it's only an alias,) Captain Bravo.\n\nVillain of the week Oscar H. Genius from Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt. Brief's real name, Briefers Rock, also counts.\n\nJust mouthing Teletha Tessa Testarossa from Full Metal Panic! makes you feel awesome.\n\nKaname Chidori has a nice ring to it as well.\n\nThe Lyrical Nanoha franchise Gives us names like Fate Testarossa, Subaru Nakajima, Teana Lanster, Vita, Signum etc. Some devices' names, such as Mach Caliber, Cross Mirage and Storm Raider sound cool as well. Ironically, the most Badass among all of them goes by the rather plain name of \"Nanoha Takamachi\" and her device is named \"Raising Heart.\"\n\nComic Books[]\n\nDizzy Cordova of 100 Bullets, with her true first name being Isabel. Also most of the rest of the Minutemen, with Meaningful Names or Punny Names like Jack Daw, Victor Ray, Cole Burns, and Lono, named after a Hawaian god.\n\nTintin.\n\nTintin means something along the lines of \"nothing at all.\" It's apparently his last name.\n\nIn French: Professeur Tournesol (Sunflower) translated as Calculus in English. Capitaine Haddock (like the fish), Bianca Castafiore, which in Italian means White Chasteflower, in Secret de la Licorne (The Secret of the Unicorn) the Loiseau brothers (Meaning Thebird brothers (just \"Bird brothers\" in the translation). Lampshaded when they are identified by a man they shot pointing at birds). In Vol 714 pour Sydney (Flight 714) Laszlo Carreidas translates as Laszlo Four Aces (as in a poker game). Also in Flight 714, first appearing in Coke en Stock (The Red Sea Sharks), is the pilot Szut. \"Zut\" is a very mild French expletive. Lampshaded when Captain Haddock thinks the man is cursing when asked his name. There are quite a few more, making Hergé a master of this trope.\n\nIn Hopeless Savages, the main character is called Skank Zero Hopeless-Savage. Her siblings' names are Rat Bastard, Arsenal Fierce and Twitch Strummer, all Hopeless-Savages. The reason being that their parents are punk musicians.\n\nLikely the best super-villain name ever, Wonder Woman's foe Dr. Psycho. According to the character's original origin, his family immigrated to America, where a barely-literate immigration clerk misspelled their last name at processing, changing it to \"Psycho\"\n\nDr McLargehuge in Empowered, a Mystery Science Theater 3000 Shout-Out. He also makes a brief appearance in City of Villains.\n\nWeasel, best friend of Deadpool, just happens to be named Jack Hammer. Not that he lives up to the name.\n\nVictor von Doom along with Count Otto von Doom.\n\nLex Luthor is a fairly badass name as well. 'Lex' is Latin for law, and 'luthor' is a Middle English word meaning evil. So his name literally means 'evil law'.\n\nLionel Luthor. Like Father, Like Son.\n\nAnother Superman example, Mister Mxyzptlk, which is properly pronounced \"Mix-Yes-Spit-Lick\", as Mxy himself explains in his first DCAU appearance.\n\nMarshal Law may not be his real name, but it is the baddest name alive.\n\nAstra Furst, first child of Astro City. When she runs away and tries to fit in with normal children she picks the name Astrid, which shouldn't really make things better.\n\nMustn't forget Zatanna Zatara of the DC comics magic brigade.\n\nNick Fury\n\nSilver Sable; her real name is Silver Sablinova, and that's pretty cool too.\n\nCasanova: Casanova Quinn\n\nDetectives Walker and Pilgrim of Powers.\n\nPreacher: Jesse Custer, by God.\n\nAlso in that vein, John Constantine from Hellblazer. Although the character himself may actually have been partly responsible for making his name take on such mythical proportions.\n\nHellboy's Christian name is Hellboy, although the name given to him before his birth is Ahnung Un Rama. Abe Sapien also qualifies.\n\nAtomic Robo interviews an Action Scientist candidate named Rex Cannon. There's also \"Baron Heinrich von Helsingard\" and Vanadis Valkyrie.\n\nAs it happens, Doctor Atomic Robo Tesla isn't half-bad either.\n\nIn Polly and The Pirates, one of Polly's friends (who hails from Fake Netherlands) has the amazingly awesome name Anastasia \"Stasia\" Van Vervendander.\n\nContessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nNew Gods: Mister Miracle, also known as... Scott Free.\n\nJonah Hex\n\nGreen Arrow's real name is Oliver Queen. A swashbuckler's name if ever I've heard one.\n\nThe most famous Green Lantern is a test pilot named Hal Jordan — that name screams \"badass test pilot,\" and just sounds chill, bro.\n\nEtrigan: Jason Blood\n\nScott Pilgrim: Knives Chau. \"Who names their kids Knives?!\" Most of the Scott Pilgrim characters also qualify, including Scott Pilgrim, Ramona Flowers, Gideon Gordon Graves, and Envy Adams, though that's not her real name.\n\nLet's also not forget the writers of comics, considering that Marv Wolfman exists.\n\nTransmetropolitan: Spider Jerusalem.\n\nIn Echo, one of the main characters is Ivy Raven, secret agent extraordinaire.\n\nThe X-Men universe is full of them. Let's start with Noriko Ashida, Alison Blaire, Raven Darkholme, Cessily Kincaid, Remy LeBeau, Jubilation Lee, Cain Marko, John Proudstar, Quentin Quire, Julio Esteban Richter, and Monet Yvette Clarisse Maria Therese St. Croix.\n\nSlade Deathstroke the Terminator. Deathstroke. His actual name is Slade Wilson. Deathstroke the Terminator is his nom de guerre.\n\nPower Man was born Carl Lucas, but promptly changed his name to Luke Cage. These days he goes by Luke Cage because frankly that's just as bad-ass as \"Power Man.\" (Nicolas Coppola agreed that \"Cage\" was way better.)\n\nFan Works[]\n\nAccording to many Mary Sue and Marty Stu sporkers, this is the easiest way to spot such types of characters in Fanfics.\n\nOne obvious example is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way from My Immortal. (Note the gratuitous apostrophe, and that \"Dementia\" is quite a lovely-sounding name so long as you ignore what the word means.)\n\n... which is why the name was used for a gag at the end of Addams Family Values.\n\nWho will always be lovingly referred to as Enoby by fans and haters alike.\n\nAnd then, you've got Mary Sues with names like \"Chihuatlan Razortalon.\" Sure, \"Razortalon\" fits the model...but \"Chihuatlan\" invokes small yappy lapdogs rather than the exoticism for which the author was no doubt shooting.\n\nIn The Mad Scientist Wars we have the Tinker family, who all have this. For instance Andrew Omega-Particle prince Risk Tinker, or his son Frederic Zeta Risk Raize Tinker. This goes back pretty far- for instance, Grandpa Florian Blitz Viktor.\n\nA character in numerous fanfics on the Phineas and Ferb Fanon Wiki is named Goldfish Darkskull. I added it here because there was a comment on his article's talk page that said \"I think Goldfish Darkskull is an Awesome McCoolname. See TV Tropes\"\n\nAll the Fullmetal Alchemist characters, as noted above, have ridiculously cool names. In the Elemental Chess Trilogy fanfic series, Riza Hawkeye gets an extra one. After she marries Roy Mustang, the men of their unit feel awkward calling her Hawkeye, but they also can't call her Mustang, so they refer to her by the affectionate nickname \"Ladyhawk.\"\n\nDeserving has a character called Sin. The author apparently intended it to be a Fail O'Suckyname bestowed on the child by a father who hated him and his mother, and calling him that is allegedly a crossing of the Moral Event Horizon, but, well, Sin.\n\nIn With Strings Attached, we have the elf As'taris Farbound.\n\nWho is promptly nicknamed by the four “Ass,” “Asshole,” Santa's Ass,” and “Jeez-Ass” (after he gets resurrected).\n\nThe Dilgar War has captain Manly Power. At first the crew of the Space Race can't believe it, then they verify it and realize his crew has to call him Captain Power, and declare it the coolest name ever.\n\nFilms — Animation[]\n\nCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: Flint Lockwood. Technically, this is left over from when his character was a suave, successful scientist.\n\nLilo and Stitch: Cobra Bubbles.\n\nTangled: Flynn Rider. His real name is Eugene Fitzherbert.\n\nFrom Disney's The Aristocats, there's Abraham DeLacey Guiseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley Cat. You can call him Thomas.\n\nCars: Lightning McQueen as well as Finn McMissile and Leland Turbo in the sequel.\n\nTorque Redline. Well, technically his name's Rod and 'Torque' is only a nickname, but come on, Torque Redline.\n\nSomething about Surf's Up's \"Cody Maverick\" exudes \"extreme sports legend\". It's youthful, has the word \"maverick\" in it, and sounds smooth off the tongue.\n\nFilms — Live Action[]\n\nIdiocracy Heavyweight President of the World: President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nRiffRaff and Rocky Horror from The Rocky Horror Picture Show\n\nLa Résistance and the people of Zion from The Matrix tend toward this, mainly to separate themselves from their former identities in the Matrix; having presumably chosen the names themselves at least partially justifies the trope. Even some native-born residents of Zion sport handles for names, like Tank and Dozer.\n\nSnake Plissken in Escape from New York.\n\nIn Mystery Men, when Mr. Furious is asked his real name, he gets out \"Phoenix Dark Dirk\" before finally admitting it's really just \"Roy\".\n\nIn the Riff Trax treatment of the Daredevil movie, when Elektra initially refuses to tell Matt Murdoch her name, Mike Nelson fills in for her: \"The name's Frigid McTurndown.\" Then, when Matt and Elektra start sparring, Bill Corbett adds, \"Okay, I lied. The name's Stompy Von Asskick.\" When the character does reveal her full name (Elektra Natchios), they add \"Electric Nachos?\" Just can't win.\n\nIn Star Wars\n\nLuke's original surname was \"Starkiller\", but after a reworking of the character it was changed to Skywalker, which most people think is still pretty cool.\n\nMace Windu\n\nHan Solo\n\nLando Calrissian\n\nDarth Vader\n\nYoda\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nQui-Gon Jinn\n\nCan we just say \"everyone in Star Wars\" already?\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 classic The Final Sacrifice had Zap Rowsdower.\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000's riff on Space Mutiny has an absolute firestorm of Awesome McCoolnames, such as Gristle McThornbody and Big McLargeHuge. So many that a few of the others on this page are direct Shout Outs. Of course, the funniest is the last one; Bob Johnson.\n\nRay Allen's character Jesus Shuttlesworth from He Got Game.\n\nInverted with the latest Terminator movie, in which an actress with the Badass name of Moon Bloodgood plays an A-10 Warthog pilot with the boring name of Blair Williams.\n\nTrevor Reznick in The Machinist, an admitted riff on dark rock icon Trent Reznor.\n\nBuckaroo Banzai.\n\nCaptain Blood. The eponymous captain is a doctor-turned-pirate who also happens to be (somehow) an Irishman.\n\nParodied in Southland Tales when The Rock (whose character is named \"Boxer\", as it happens) is describing a film role he wrote for himself, ending with, \"His name... is Jericho Cain.\"\n\nAhnuld's name in End of Days is, in fact, Jericho Cane.\n\nJames Woods' character in Diggstown is Gabriel Caine.\n\nJohn Shaft, the eponymous private detective of Shaft.\n\nIn Superbad, Fogell gives himself the name \"McLovin\" on his fake ID. A cop says it \"sounds like a sexy cheeseburger.\" They also believe it and become friends with him. Until The Reveal that they were just playing along to try to give him role models he never had.\n\nThe quarterback in Varsity Blues, Lance Harbor.\n\nInverted in Almost Famous, where Cameron Crowe (mull that name over in your head...) named his Author Avatar character \"William Miller\"; the DVD Commentary mentions this was a subtle Lampshade Hanging of the trope. However, there is a character called Penny Lane.\n\nThe Fifth Element — Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg.\n\nNapoleon Dynamite.\n\nThe Rocky series is lousy with awesome names for his opponents. They include \"Spider\" Rico, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago, Tommy \"The Machine\" Gunn, and Mason \"The Line\" Dixon.\n\nCastor Troy in Face Off. He and his brother Pollux are named for the Gemini of Greek mythology.\n\nParodied in DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story:\n\nDerek Zoolander.\n\nThe Australian short film The House of Names revolves around two protagonists who spend all their time trying to think up something cool to change their names to.\n\nIn Boogie Nights the main character changes his name to Dirk Diggler. That's just okay, but the name of his character (in the Kung Fu ... er ... something-em-up he wrote) is named Brock Landers. (His partner Reed Rothchild's character is the even better Chest Rockwell.)\n\nThe B-scifi movie Trancers, and its many sequels, revolve around a time-travelling future cop by the name of Jack Deth. In a subversion, pretty much everyone he meets outside of his own time period mocks his name relentlessly.\n\nThe unlikely-named John Spartan and Simon Phoenix in Demolition Man.\n\nThe eponymous protagonist of the movie Major Payne. His full name is Benson Winifred Payne, which isn't too great at all, but once he's joined the Marine Corps and attained the rank of Major...\n\nBlack Dynamite. Played for Laughs, as this is apparently his real name. In one scene, a few neighborhood girls remark that both their mothers told them that \"Black Dynamite\" is the name of their father. Looking guilty, our hero asserts, \"A lot of cats have that name...\"\n\nClear Rivers in Final Destination and its first sequel.\n\nWhile many Germanic names sound this way to the English-speaking ear, Wolf Helius from Fritz Lang's film The Woman in the Moon probably qualifies.\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno\n\nThe titular Nemo Nobody in Mr. Nobody, who is the last mortal human after advances in medical technology have cured aging and decrepitude.\n\nKill Bill has several of them, like Elle Driver, Vernita Green, Sophie Fatale and Beatrix Kiddo isn't shabby either.\n\nOne of the main characters from Smoke Signals whose surname is Build-A-Fire. His grandmother is known as Grandma Builds-A-Fire.\n\nIn She Devil is a character, an overly developed, and quite healthy woman named Olivia Honey.\n\nMost James Bond films have cool names, such as Jaws, Pussy Galore, and Goldfinger. Ironically, \"James Bond\" was chosen as a good spy name because it's so ordinary.\n\nIn Down Periscope, the electricians name was \"Nitro\". But he was looking for a cool nickname — \"What do you think of this ... Mike\"\n\nJunito Rocket Racer Rebel Cortez or Juni for short, from Spy Kids.\n\nWhat about his sister, Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa-Brava Cortez?\n\nJericho \"Action\" Jackson in Action Jackson.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson gets one, \"Mister Señor Love Daddy\" in Do the Right Thing, as is his due.\n\nLeslie Nielson's secret agent parody \"Spy Hard\" had Agent WD-40: Dick Steele\n\nIn Guillermo Del Toro's Pacific Rim, we are treated to character names such as Raleigh Antrobus, Yancy Antrobus, Newt Gotlieb, Tendo Choi, Herc Hansen, and Stacker Pentecost.\n\nFrom the movie Gladiator, the protagonist's name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Sounds like a serious individual and, of course, he is.\n\nGamebooks[]\n\nIn Lone Wolf, all the Kai have names along the lines of \"Adjective Animal\", given upon their initiation. Many of them follow this trope. For instance, the main character started out as \"Silent Wolf\", but after the rest of the order was killed in the prologue to the first book, he took on the book-naming appellation Lone Wolf.\n\nLiterature[]\n\nThe Artful Dodger from Oliver Twist.\n\nArguably Ponyboy and Sodapop Curtis from The Outsiders.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is full of unlikely names that sound pretty cool.\n\nHotblack Desiato, which is actually the name of rather posh, London estate agents.\n\nZaphod Beeblebrox, fitting his eccentric rock star/politician/dingbat personality.\n\n\"Slartibartfast,\" which was created to sound obscene but not be. Adams started with Phartiphukborlz and changed it just enough to get past the censors.\n\nAnd, of course, Ford Prefect, although it sounds much cooler to American readers who mostly didn't realize that he's actually named after a sensible British motorcar.\n\nThis trope is exemplified by the persona created by Discworld character Agnes Nitt, Perdita X Dream, where X stands for \"person who has a cool and interesting middle name\"; when Agnes tells other people she'd like to be called this, they usually end up calling her \"that Agnes who wants to be called Perditax\". In the novel Carpe Jugulum, it was further parodied when the vampire equivalent to Goths were changing their names to extremely drab or 'preppy' names. \"Lady Strigoiul said her daughter has taken to calling herself Wendy.\"\n\nAlso Mightily Oats, a shortened form of \"The Quite Reverend Mightily-Praiseworthy-Are-Ye-Who-Exalteth-Om Oats\".\n\nThe one-shot vampire from \"Feet of Clay\", Dragon King-of-Arms.\n\nThat's actually a title rather than a name. \"Dragon\" is the head of the Ankh-Morpork College of Arms, which is based on the real British College of Arms, an office of the Royal Household. The College is composed of 13 officers of arms (a.k.a. heralds), including at the time of writing Garter Principal King of Arms, Lancaster Herald and Bluemantle Pursuivant.\n\nSuffer-Not-Injustice Vimes.\n\nThe rats from The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents read labels on tincans and name themselves as whatever they think sounds good. Thus you have perfectly respectable individuals named Darktan, Feedsfour, Peaches and Hamnpork. And their arguably most Book Smart member is named Dangerous Beans, which is a bit hard to take seriously.\n\nOne Igor had former masters with names such as Screaming Dr. Berserk and Crazed Baron Ha-Ha.\n\nFindthee Swing (from \"Night Watch\")\n\nModern Omnians have very...unusual names to the effect of Mightily-Praiseworthy-Are-Ye-Who-Exalteth-Om, Constable Visit-The-Infidel-With-Explanatory-Pamphlets and Smite-the-Unbeliever-with-Cunning-Arguments.\n\nGood Omens:\n\nfeatures Anathema Device. The Devices were a real family who were involved in witch trials in the 17th century (so were the Nutters), and Anathema is a word that has a variety of meanings in a religious context; put them together and you have a perfect set-up for scenes like Agnes' prediction that ends in the sentence \"And thou shalt be there also, Anathema\" — which the modern Anathema assumes (correctly, it is implied) to be addressed to her.\n\nThou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer. Newton Pulsifer said he would go on a rampage as well with a name like that\n\nit deserves notion at this point there are also main characters like 'Aziraphale' and 'Crowley' and minor character 'Warlock'. I dare you to find people with those names. I know I'd like to have one of them.\n\nNeil Gaiman's American Gods could make this list based simply on the gods' various real and assumed names, even without the protagonist's exceptionally cool name: Shadow Moon, aka Baldur Moon.\n\nCitizens of The Culture in the novels of Iain Banks have ridiculously long and odd-sounding names. Some parts are chosen for them, some by them, some depending on where they were born/what they were designed for (AIs). Examples include Rasd-Corudesa Diziet Embless Sma 'Da Marenhide and Foristi-Whirl Skaffen Amtiskaw Handrahen Dran Easpyou.\n\nCulture Full Names are only partly names as we understand the term, and are as much addresses as anything else. (Banks suggested that his Culture Full Name might be Sun-Earther Iain El-Bonko Banks of South Queensferry.) The full names of sentient drones (like Skaffen-Amtiskaw) also provide their place of manufacture and capabilities: the main character in The Player Of Games realises just how deep he's gotten when told that a 'Xato' name-component designates a Special Circumstances agent equipped for espionage against other 'Involved' civilisations.\n\nThen the Minds, the more capable A Is responsible for controlling ships etc have some...odd names. Killing Time. Limiting Factor. Just Another Victim Of The Ambient Morality. Ultimate Ship The Second. No More Mr. Nice Guy. The list goes on...\n\nThey must use the same book of names as the ships in Halo. Pillar of Autumn... In Amber Clad...\n\nAlthough, the names in the books are more mundane (Vostok, Arabia, Heracles, Trafalgar), except with some odd ones out (UNSC Frigate Do Ya Feel Lucky? from Contact Harvest. I am not making this up). The Culture ships are named by their Minds, to match what they feel their personality is like. Warships tend towards more aggressive names like Gunboat Diplomat whereas civilian ships have less aggressive names (like Stranger Here Myself).\n\nWhen told by a critic that the Minds lacked gravitas, Iain M. Banks responded by naming a few ships in response to this (Very Little Gravitas Indeed, Zero Gravitas, and so on). Stood Far Back When the Gravitas Was Handed Out...\n\nPhilip Reeve may have been reading The Culture novels when he started calling airships in his Mortal Engines series things like 'Damn You, Gravity!' , '13th Floor Elevator', 'Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Machiney' and 'The Sadness Of Things'. There is also an aeroplane called 'Combat Wombat'.\n\nCommander Kelp in Artemis Fowl. His unit has \"trouble\" as their middle names, but Kelp literally has \"trouble\" as his first name. As in, the name on the books is \"Trouble Kelp\".\n\nAnd of course, the title character himself, Artemis Fowl.\n\nTwo short stories by Edgar Allan Poe center around a narrator named Signora Psyche Zenobia. Only her enemies, she proclaims, ever refer to her as Suky Snobbs. Thus, this is Older Than Radio.\n\nDan Abnett loves this trope so very, very much, especially in his Warhammer 40k writings. The Inquisition books give us Gregor Eisenhorn, Gideon Ravenor, Bex Begundi, Godwyn Fischig, Olm Madorthine... etc. In the Gaunt's Ghosts books the obvious one is Ibram Gaunt himself, but the most recent book, Blood Pact, gives us Isiah Mercure. He's really lucky he's the head of an intergalactic intelligence agency that spends its time fighting both the Forces of Chaos and the Inqusition, or that name would probably make his life really difficult.\n\nHarry Potter has an Aerith and Bob aesthetic, contrasting very normal character names like Harry Potter with fantastic wizard names like Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Severus Snape, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Sirius Black, Gilderoy Lockhart, Xenophilius Lovegood, Fleur Delacour, Scorpius Hyperion, Lorcan and Lysander Scamander, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Bellatrix Lestrange, Draco Malfoy, Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff, and Salazar Slytherin, Gellert Grindewald, Charity Burbage, Horace Slughorn, Alecto and Amycus Carrow, Septima Vector, Silvanus Kettleburn, Aurora Sinistra, Quirinus Quirrell, Bathsheda Babbling, Bathilda Bagshot, and so forth.\n\nHoratio Hornblower.\n\nIn the Skulduggery Pleasant series, characters take names instead of using their given names. Some of those names include Valkyrie Cain, Ghastly Bespoke, Billy-Ray Sanguine, and Murder Rose.\n\nGhastly Bespoke, incidentally, is a tailor.\n\nSkulduggery specifically advises Stephanie (who, later, takes up the name Valkyrie Cain) against choosing a \"cool\" name over a name that suits your personality (using a middle-aged woman known as \"Jet\" as an example against). Nevertheless, the names manage to sound cool AND suit the characters.\n\nIn Tamora Pierce's Circle of Magic series, all of the dedicates in Winding Circle took nature/animal names after sufficient time in the temple. Many of them are quite the Badass, despite their names generally being random.\n\nThere's also Numair Salmalin in the Tortall Universe, who made his up because he thought \"Arram Draper\" didn't sound badass enough for one of the world's most powerful wizards.\n\nMaximum Ride. Other illustrious examples of this would be the flock: Iggy, Angel, the Gasman, Nudge, Total and Fang.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Total is a dog.\n\nAt least sort of justified by the fact that they picked their own names.\n\nEven better examples in the names they give to the talent agent in the fifth book: The White Knight, The Sharkalator, Cinnamon Allspice La Fever, and Isabella von Frankenstein Rothschild.\n\nWolf Larsen and Death Larsen, from The Sea Wolf by Jack London. Not quite as awesome as the other names mentioned here, but this book was written in 1904.\n\nDragonlance\n\nThe gnomish race are blessed, one and all, with surnames that consist of, quite literally, everything that has happened to them in their life, and in the lives of their parents, and pretty much the rest of their family going back generations, as well. A Running Gag in the book series was unwitting people asking a gnome his name and having to interrupt the avalanche that follows.\n\nDragonlance pushes this trope to painful extremes. Examples include \"Sturm Brightblade\", \"Steel Brightblade\", \"Alhanna Starbeeze\", \"Dhamon Grimwulf\", \"Flint Fireforge\", \"Huma Dragonbane\", \"Goldmoon\", \"Riverwind\", \"Eben Shatterstone\", Cyan Bloodbane\", and so forth.\n\nIsaac Asimov, in the Foundation Series, gave the a similar cultural trait to the inhabitants of Gaia (a planet-spanning telepath collective) with names such as \"Blissenobiarella\" and \"Suranoviremblastiran\" (and names said to be hundreds of syllables long, but never mentioned in full). The names are universally abbreviated in normal conversation, however.\n\nChristopher Brookmyre's Violent Glaswegian Fair Cop is named Angelique de Xavia. This is lampshaded by pretty much every other character (her colleagues call her 'Angel X' and 'Special Agent X'; when a criminal captures her at gunpoint and confiscates her ID his immediate comment is: \"Cool name.\").\n\nH. Beam Piper did the same thing in his science fiction stories, giving us characters with names like Themistocles Mzangwe and Hideyoshi O'Leary.\n\nLikewise Juan Epstein from Welcome Back Kotter.\n\nSnow Crash: the main character's name is Hiro Protagonist, his roommate is named Vitaly Chernobyl, and his partner is Yours Truly (abbreviated to YT). These are all actually nicknames or stagenames, but the closest we come to their real names is that Hiro's full first name is \"Hiroaki.\" On the other hand, the Aleut Dmitri \"Raven\" Ravinoff sports a suitably ominous and legitimate name.\n\nIn The Lost World, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, most people have mainly normal names. Except for George Edward Challenger.\n\nAnd Maple White.\n\nCatch-22 is a treasure trove of gloriously silly and bizarre names, many of them Meaningful Name. The hero Yossarian's exotic Armenian name indicates his detachment from the rest of the soldiers. Major Major Major is instantly promoted to the rank of Major due to his name, and can never change his rank because a mail attendant thinks it's funny. Milo Minderbinder can think of nothing but profit and capitalism. Major —— de Coverley looks so impressive that no one has the nerve to ask him his first name. Lieutenant Scheisskopf (\"shithead\" in German) lives up to his name, but enjoys a steady string of promotions.\n\nMike Hammer.\n\nLord Peter Wimsey (an appropriately cool name on its own) sometimes while undercover calls himself by his two middle names—Death Bredon (\"Some people with that particular name pronounce it to rhyme with 'teeth' but I prefer it to rhyme with 'breath' — more dramatic, what?\"). And his nephew is named St. George.\n\nActually, \"St. George\" is the nephew's courtesy title (as the only son of Lord Peter's older brother, The Duke of Denver). However, both the Duke and his son were named \"Gerald\", and the younger Gerald was nicknamed \"Gerrykins\" which morphed into \"Pickled Gherkins\"!\n\nThe Saint's Simon Templar.\n\nChildren's book series Grey Griffins has Maximilian Grayson Sumner III, a rich billionaire's kid, Harley Davidson Eisenstein, the Badass, Natalia Anastasia Felicia Romanov, the smart Snooping Little Kid, and on the uncool note, Ernest Blumfeld Tweeney, The Load.\n\nTalon Karrde, Mara Jade, Shada Du'kal. Though the first is only ever called by his last name, and the other two are almost exclusively called by their first names.\n\nIn Deathstalker's Legacy, a criminal has the unlikely moniker of Toby Goddamnit. He never says how he got his name before he dies.\n\nHow can you forget the main character? Owen Deathstalker. And that's not even going into Simon Green's other books, like The Nightside with gems like Razor Eddie, and Shotgun Suzie (aka \"oh crap it's her why not just put gun to your head, it'll probably hurt less.\") and that's just for starters. There's tons more. Simon seems completely unable to give his characters normal name, John Taylor being the most normal, and it's still pretty cool.\n\nThe main character of America the Beautiful (written by Moon Unit Zappa, who's got a pretty awesome name herself) is called America Throne. Granted, her father A) changed his surname from Tronov when he immigrated from Russia and B) was a crazy hippie artist. (Mer won the name lottery in her family. Her brother's name is Spoonie.)\n\nIn The Long Hot Future, the breeding program Eugenix assigns three given names, an alphanumeric code, four surnames, and an etcetera. The main character's full name is Keef Joy Brazen X-5 Lattimore Balzac Marsalis Wu Etc.\n\nAphrodite in The House of Night series. Justified because when fledgling vampyres enter the school, they are allowed to change their names and are legally emancipated from their parents. Being incredibly self-centred and vain, she chose the name of the goddess of love.\n\nPatricia McKillip's Riddle-Master trilogy features several. Alongside abnormal-but-not-too-strange names like Eliard, Mathom, Astrin, and Rood, you have a few incredibly awesome names (i.e. Ghisteslwchlohm). And then, of course, there's Deth.\n\nOddly enough, the literary James Bond was originally intended to avert this trope entirely, the name itself being picked up from an ornithology book. Of course, nowadays the name is known worldwide for both the character and the brand.\n\nFrom The Icemark Chronicles we have Thirrin Freer Strong-in-the-Arm Lindenshield, Wildcat of the North, Taker of the Hand of Bellorum. In fact, any non-Polypontian in that trilogy counts.\n\nThe Dresden Files: The \"actors\" in Blood Rites have to pick stage names, and Bobby considers names like \"Rocko Stone\" or \"Rack McGranite\". Finally, at Harry's suggestion, he goes with \"Gowan Commando.\"\n\nAuthor Jim Butcher's bichon frise's name, Frost, is reputedly short for \"Frostbite Doomreaver McBain.\"\n\nFor those tropers not familiar with what a bichon frise looks like, it's worth noting that this is also a case of Deathbringer the Adorable.\n\nUm, hello, Mr. Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden. Justified Trope given the theme of the novels, but in a series loaded with Meaningful Names, Butcher also manages to make his main character's given name sound freakin' awesome.\n\nAnastasia Luccio? Ebenezar McCoy? Margaret LeFay Dresden? Lara, Inari, and Thomas Raith? There's a lot of cool names in the Dresden Files and that's not even getting into the nonhumans. Like Lasciel, Anduriel, or the Leanansidhe.\n\nThe majority of the human characters in the Codex Alera have awesome names as well, most of them in Gratuitous Latin. The best one? Gaius Tavarus Magnus, a.k.a. Gaius Octavian, a.k.a. Tavar, a.k.a. Rufus Scipio. Yes, Tavi gets four of them to make up for being an Odd Name Out. Though credit must also be given to Antillus Crassus, Antillar Maximus, Aria Placida, Gaius Sextus, Fidelias ex Cursori, Aquitainus Attis and Invidia, Araris Valerian, and, much as we hate to admit it, Kalarus Brencis.\n\nAuthor Brandon Sanderson once expressed regret in one of his online annotations that he was unable to give character \"Kelsier\" a cool last name like Mistshadows.\n\nThe First Law: Logen Rip-Your-Fucking-Face-Off Ninefingers.\n\nThe name Starbuck may signal Herman Melville's penchant for symbolism in Moby-Dick, but it also signaled \"awesome\" to both TV sci-fi (Battlestar Galactica) and Seattle coffeehouse proprietors.\n\nIt certainly signaled \"awesome\" to Bill Starbuck, who changed his name from Smith because that didn't suit a man like him (who also considers \"Lizzie\" too prosaic a name for a woman — \"why, it don't stand for anything!\").\n\nThomas Pynchon: Pirate Prentice, Oedipa Maas, Patience Eggslap, Tyrone Slothrop, Mike Fallopian, Ronald Cherrycoke, and Clayton \"Bloody\" Chiclitz.\n\nJaantony Riv Wolf High-Ironjade Vikary from George R. R. Martin's Dying of the Light. Justified in that the Kavlaars (partly) choose their own names when they come of age.\n\nHonor Harrington, though the first name \"Honor\" is actually part of a fairly common tradition of using virtues as female first names, such as \"Chastity\" and \"Grace.\"\n\nEverworld has an elf character who is actually named Mac Cool, and it's a Meaningful Name, with the character ultimately turning out to be Too Cool to Live. He's also the \"Bob\" of Aerith and Bob, since the other members of his elven culture have more traditional Celtic names like Etain, Goewynne, and Camulos.\n\nActually, Mac Cool is a pretty Celtic name, since Finn Mac Cool is the Anglicised version of Irish legendary hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill. In fact, it's the kind of Celtic name you might come up with if you didn't know very many Celtic names.\n\nFrancesca Lia Block is all over this trope, possibly due to her own name. She justifies this in part by creating a lot of mother characters who would totally name their kids things like Duck, Witch Baby, (a very pale blonde) Cherokee...and so by extension it gets oddly believable that there would be a kid out there named My Secret Agent Lover Man. It also helps that the stories are supposed to be like fairy tales.\n\nAyn Rand was fond of this trope: Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d'Anconia is from Atlas Shrugged. There's also Dagny Taggart and Howard Roark, which sound so self-consciously Occidental that it's hard to forget that English is not the author's first language.\n\nLet's not forget D.B.C. ( stands for \"Dirty But Clean\") Pierre's Man Booker Prize winning Vernon God Little.\n\nIn Dean Koontz's From the Corner of his Eye, the villain (named Enoch Cain, naturally) learns from a newspaper article that one of his victims was named Kickmule. He's surprised to learn Kickmule is a legitimate name, and since it's so badass decides to use it in the future if he ever needs another alias (\"no one would ever mess with Wolfgang Kickmule\").\n\nAlexander Bonaparte Cust in Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders was specifically given a grandiose name by his mother.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings gives us Helm's Deep, founded by Helm Hammerhand.\n\nWarrior Cats is in general kind of a crapshoot with names. Characters like Tigerclaw, Lionblaze, Fireheart, etc. exist alongside the more boringly named cats (Graystripe, Bluefur, etc.) and cats with names that, from a human perspective, can seem outright stupid (Loudbelly, Mudpuddle, etc.)\n\nIsaac Asimov named the hero of his book David Starr, Space Ranger after his son David, but soon decided that David was too boring a name for a space adventurer. In the subsequent books in the series, everyone starts calling David by his nickname, Lucky Starr.\n\nIn Saving Zoe, the main character is named Echo, after the Greek myth.\n\nMost traditional pulp fiction and hardboiled characters fall into this trope. Names like Sam Spade or Nero Wolfe.\n\nThe Andalite names from the Animorphs are awesome, like Elfangor-Sirinal-Shamtul, Aximilli-Esgaroth-Esthill and Alloran-Semitur-Corrass.\n\nIn the Stravaganza books, the name Sky Meadows is... odd to English-speaking ears. But when he stravagates to Talia, he's named Celestino Pascoli. His name basically Took a Level in Badass.\n\nLyra Belacqua in His Dark Materials, though she later trades it in for Silvertongue. But the names of characters' dæmons tend to be melodious and exotic — like Pantalaimon, Stelamaria, Zohariel, and Kirjava.\n\nThe Reverend Doctor Syn in Russell Thorndike's series of books.\n\nVictorian authors did this often, but a master at it was Anthony Trollope. who conjured up a Duke of Omnium Gatherem, doctors Sir Omicron Pi and Dr. Fillgrave, a country rector with many children: Mr. Quiverfull, the totally bland and effaced Lord Fawn, among many others.\n\nThe titular character of Alyzon Whitestarr. The author claimed to have met a family while on a walk, and liked the daughter's name so much that she decided to use it for her book. There is a real person out there with that name. (Maybe.)\n\nPractically every Vampire and Vampanese in The Saga of Darren Shan (Cirque du Freak Series US) has an amazing name. Who can't like names like Larten Crepsley, Vancha March, Arra Sails, Gannen Harst... the list goes on and on. Even the grotesque-looking little person, Harkat Mulds, has an amazing name, especially considering as it is an anagram of his name from before he became a little person, Kurda Smahlt.\n\nBlack Company mercenaries try to leave the past behind and the wizards have to keep their true names secret. As such, both are Only Known by Their Nickname and tend to end up with either Names to Run Away From Really Fast or obviously ironic variety. Croaker once joked that most of the new Taken got lame names when compared to the likes of Soulcatcher, Howler or the Hanged Man.\n\nIn the graphic novel Foiled, the protagonist's name is Aliera Carstairs.\n\nGerman philosopher Oswald Spengler coined many terms in Decline Of The West, the coolest among which is \"Magians\" for the Jews (and Muslims, and Greek-Orthodox Christians... generally, everyone from the Middle East following a religion which originated there around 0-1000 AD).\n\nThe protagonist of John Ringo's Legacy of the Aldenata novels is named Michael Leonidas O'Neill. He gets a mention for Leonidas, of course.\n\nA Certain Magical Index: \"Touma Kamijou\" has the alternate reading \"The One Who Purifies Gods and Slays Demons\" (or \"The One Who Purifies God and Exorcises the Devil\", depending on the translation). \"Touma\" can also be read as \"Invisible Demon\" and \"Kamijou\" as \"Above God\".\n\nFrom Horton Hears a Who!; you gotta admit, Vlad Vladikoff is a badass name.\n\nLive Action TV[]\n\nMagnum, P.I., TV show private detective and name of firearms and cartridge. Humorously, the Galician dub was unfamiliar with the acronym for Private Investigator, and mixed it up with the actual surname \"Pi,\" calling him \"Magnum π.\"\n\nMaxwell Smart of Get Smart—done as a parody and pun.\n\nRemington Steele—an aversion as she picked the name because it sounded cool.\n\nIn the Whedonverse, many characters go by interesting or unusual names, such as Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles (though cool in the USA, is normal in the UK), Oz, Fred (a girl), Gunn, Pike, Jayne (a man), River, Inara, Book, Wash, Jubal Early, Merrick, Kennedy, Spike, Angel, Drusilla, and so forth. This is somewhat justified in that most of these are diminutive versions of rather normal first and last names.\n\nSpecifically, Xander is a diminutive of Alexander, Oz of Osbourne (it's also his last name), and Fred of Winnifred. Giles, Gunn, Book, and Pike are all their last names (first names being Rupert, Charles, Derrial, and Sheppard). Spike and Angel are both nicknames/noms de guerre, their real names being William and Liam respectively—being vampires, they've lived so long that they don't really use their old names anymore. Wash is short for Washburne, his surname, and Jubal Early is apparently named after an American Civil War General (who happens to be an ancestor of Nathan Fillion). Buffy is usually a nickname for Elizabeth, although it's pretty clear that Joyce cut out the middleman and actually named her Buffy — it's on her gravestone.\n\nAlso in Dollhouse, \"Arcane\". Also known as Clyde. Not to mention the actives with their cool \"callsigns\"—Echo, November, Alpha, Tango, Sierra, Whiskey and... er... Mike. We don't see much of Mike. These nicknames all come from the ICAO/NATO/ITU phonetic alphabet (used mainly by pilots and Western militaries). Each word corresponds with the letter it starts with. So think of all the cool names that were had by Dolls that were not seen or had not been created yet: Delta, India, Lima, Papa, Yankee and Zulu. Not so McCool names: Charlie, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel (yeesh), Juliet, Oscar, Quebec, Romeo, Uniform (ouch) and X-ray (debatable depending on your level of nerdiness).\n\nThe NATO alphabet uses \"India\" for I (though Indigo is exceptionally cooler and we should lobby for it) and, for Z, \"Zulu\" (which even seems more Awesome McCoolname than Zebra, really).\n\nAccording to Rob Tapert, his original plan was to spell name Xena's name with a 'Z' (i.e 'Zena'), however the network didn't think it was cool enough, opting instead to spell it with the \"much cooler\" X.\n\nCastle gives us Richard Edgar \"Rick\" Castle and his daughter Alexis Castle, as well as the new captain Victoria Gates (better known as \"Iron Gates\").\n\nThe Mentalist also gives us a few; Teresa Lisbon, Kimball Cho, and former CBI supervising agent Madeleine Hightower.\n\nBattlestar Galactica has an entire crew's worth of Awesome McCoolnames, starting with William and Lee Adama, Kara Thrace, Karl Agathon, Galen Tyrol, Felix Gaeta, Sharon Valerii, Anastasia Dualla, Billy Keikeya, Diana Seelix (the last being made-up on the spot by Aaron Douglas for a previously nameless character), Gaius Baltar and Admiral Helena Cain. And that's not even counting the pilot callsigns, which qualify for Badass Nickname territory.\n\nAnd of course, the Galactica itself.\n\nAll That: Randy Quench, VOLENTEEAH FIAHMAN.\n\nAlluded to in True Blood. While Sookie Stackhouse has an unusual name herself, she is surprised to learn that the first vampire she ever meets has the thoroughly mundane name of \"Bill.\"\n\nSubverted to the point of parody in Stargate Atlantis with the Exclusively Evil Wraith (alien goth insect vampires) never giving their true names, therefore prompting the human characters to name them generic Earth names in retaliation. Hence Steve, Bob, Michael, Kenny, and, lest we forget, Todd. Most of which are, at some point or other, the series Big Bad.\n\nFrom Scrubs:\n\nStephen Colbert used this to protect the identity of an ex-Colbert Report security guard who had been deployed in Afghanistan.\n\nOn one Colbert Report (the one with Jeff Bridges), a name on the ticker of donators was \"Ace McAwesome.\"\n\nIn Jimmy Kimmel Live's 2010 \"Handsome Men's Club\" sketch Ethan Hawke demanded his name be legally changed to Handsome Hawke.\n\nFrank Cannon from Cannon.\n\nDetective Robert T. Ironside from Ironside.\n\nKono Kalakaua from Hawaii Five-O.\n\nAs the quotes page shows, the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000 had a ball giving such names to the beefy protagonist of Space Mutiny, Dave Ryder. The show's Wiki has a complete list.\n\nHilariously subverted when one of the names is \"Bob Johnson.\"\n\nThey also mocked an example of this concept mercilessly in the episode The Final Sacrifice. What was the character's name? Zap Rowsdower, for a middle-aged pudgy Canadian man with a mullet.\n\nAlso during Hercules Against the Moon Men, Joel and the bots try to come up with macho names a 'la Alan Steel. Crow chooses \"Drake Tungsten\", whereas Servo settles for \"Ric Drywall.\" Which is admittedly better than his first choice, \"Russ Tile Floor;\" or any of Crow's suggestions: \"Adam Plexiglass,\" \"Nick Pig Iron,\" \"Jim J Bullock...\"\n\nThe episode 12 To the Moon featured an early version of the Ryder treatment, with an international lunar mission being headed by your standard symbol of '50s American superiority, a muscular blonde idiot. Being completely unremarkable in every other way, Mike and the 'bots saddle him with names like \"Dirk Beefbroth,\" and \"Plank Ironchest.\"\n\nAfter Phoebe marries Mike on Friends, she goes to legally change her last name to his... and instead changes her name to Princess Consuela Bananahammock. She doesn't see what the problem is until Mike threatens to change his name to Crap Bag (\"It's easy to remember, just think of a bag of crap.\").\n\nMike of The Young Ones refers to himself as \"The Cool Person\".\n\nwhich is revealed to be his actual name, Mike Thecoolperson.\n\nTarquin Fin-tim-lin-bin-whin-bim-lim-bus-stop-F'tang-F'tang-Olé-Biscuitbarrel, of Monty Python's Flying Circus fame.\n\nHow dare you forget the famous composer, Johann Gambolputty de von Ausfern- schplenden- schlitter- crasscrenbon- fried- digger- dingle- dangle- dongle- dungle- burstein- von- knacker- thrasher- apple- banger- horowitz- ticolensic- grander- knotty- spelltinkle- grandlich- grumblemeyer- spelterwasser- kurstlich- himbleeisen- bahnwagen- gutenabend- bitte- ein- nürnburger- bratwustle- gerspurten- mitz- weimache- luber- hundsfut- gumberaber- shönedanker- kalbsfleisch- mittler- aucher von Hautkopft of Ulm?\n\n\"My name is spelt 'Raymond Luxury Yacht' but it's pronounced 'Throatwobbler Mangrove'.\"\n\nThroat-WARBLER Mangrove, you snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings!\n\nAlright, stop that, stop that—it's silly.\n\nCan't forget about the affable Dinsdale Piranha, and his cruel, sarcastic brother Doug.\n\nIn fact, \"Monty Python.\"\n\nJeff Slade, the stupidly macho-named detective from the shortlived nice-idea-but-appallingly-executed Crime Traveller. As if the character name wasn't bad enough he was also cursed with being played by an ex-soap actor with a charisma bypass — thus making the character even harder to take seriously.\n\nWhen Jeremy Clarkson was given the task of designing Top Gear's home-built electric car, he named it the Hammerhead Eagle i-Thrust. However, he also named the prototype: \"Geoff.\"\n\nHis co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May had separately decided as a matter of principle that an electric car should have a rugged name instead of something vaguely smart like \"Intelligentsia.\"\n\nIn another episode, Hammond refuses to believe the actual name of Lamborghini's new chief test driver, Max Venturi, who replaced their old chief test driver, Valentino Balboni. Clarkson jokingly responds:\n\nSledge Hammer!. Also his father, Jack.\n\nIn Red Dwarf episode \"Back to Reality\", the crew all hallucinate that they have returned to Earth, and are given new identities. Kryten's name turns out to be \"Jake Bullet\" and he's a member of the police force. Lampshaded:\n\nOf course, this being Red Dwarf, Kryten does turn out to be a traffic control cop.\n\nThe Adventures of Brisco County Jr.\n\nFrom Psych: It is a Running Gag with Shawn introducing Gus with an Awesome McCoolname to other people.\n\nTendou Souji. Why is it badass? His name more or less means \"He who walks the path of heaven, ruling all\".\n\nEqually badass is his Unknown Rival Kamishiro Tsurugi, which means \"He who overthrows the gods with the slash of a sword\".\n\nIn the Disney series Sonny With a Chance, the snooty star of teen drama \"Mackenzie Falls\" is Chad Dylan Cooper. He is played by Sterling Knight, which sounds a bit snootier and lot more Badass.\n\nCaptain Marvelous, from Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger.\n\nA WKRP episode had Jennifer dating a (seemingly) perfect guy named Steel. He says \"I think a man's name says a lot about him...What did you say your name was?\" to Les...\n\nRyan Laserbeam. No, seriously.\n\nThe titular character in Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future was actually named Jonathan Power. And he held the rank of Captain.\n\nThe Clash of the Titans round of Good News Week sees contestants use their names as buzzers. Often they choose cooler names instead. Examples include \"Demon Dawg\", \"Adam Barrington Spencer\" and \"We'd like some more honey prawns at this table, please!\"\n\nOne My Name Is Earl episode has Randy and Darnell discussing the Witness Protection Program after revealing that Darnell was IN the program, and Randy expresses a desire to be named 'Crash Fistfight'.\n\nNapoleon Solo of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., who, curiously, almost never uses a pseudonym. You'd think that after a while, THRUSH agents would stop being fooled by Napoleon Solo, Investment Banker. The ludicrousness of the name is lampshaded from time to time: for example, when he has Easy Amnesia and someone tells him who he is, he refuses to believe it.\n\nBabylon 5 : the Shadows think their name is so cool because it is one thousand syllables long and cannot be pronounced by you puny mortals. Then, the Shadows get surprised and angry that we puny mortals keep on calling them \"Shadows.\"\n\nTed Mosby, having met a guy who calls himself The Captain, decides to name himself Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.\n\nAn earlier episode has Marshall and Lily discuss changing their last name to Awesome upon marriage. They also said plans to name their hypothetical children Totally and Freakin'.\n\nAfter conceiving their baby in Barney's bathroom during Irene, Marshall wants to name their son Hurricane Eriksen. Ted and Barney also rename Barney's niece while \"bro-parenting\" to Hurricane Mosby-Stinson\n\nThe baby's name is Marvin Wait-for-it Eriksen and all the characters find it awesome.\n\nThe Doctor, from Doctor Who.\n\nAnd played with in the Human Nature/Family of Blood arc. John Smith dreams of a man called the Doctor- Nurse Redfern says it's a personification of his desire to be a dashing hero. The twist being that the Doctor is his true self.\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor once aliased as Captain Troy Handsome of International Rescue.\n\nActually, most Time Lords have cool names. Most notable example: Romanadvoratrelundar, or 'Romana' for short. She'd prefer Fred. The Meddling Monk and The Master also count for this trope.\n\nStormageddon, Dark Lord of All, the name that a baby gave himself. His parents call him \"Alfie\".\n\nDon't forget Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethridge-Stewart.\n\nAnd Captain Jack Harkness. 'Captain Jack' on its own is cool enough!\n\nPlayed for laughs in iCarly, with the bodyguard in \"iSam's Mom\". He's a war veteran who only speaks in a growling monotone. He's more than willing to be incredibly violent towards the slightest threat, and he's got a significantly large hole in his leg that's not a bullet wound. His name? Gunsmoke.\n\nFrom Drake and Josh, we get the amazing psuedonyms Jefferson Steelflex and Alvin Yakitori.\n\nAirwolf seems to enjoy this trope with Stringfellow and Saint John (pronounced Sinjin) Hawke. Also, Dominic Santini.\n\nRobert Winchester and Dr. Norris.\n\nThe A-Team has Bosco Barracus.\n\nAnd John Smith.\n\nThe cyberneticist Bruce Maddox from Star Trek: The Next Generation. The character is a jerkass, though.\n\nBritish drama The Hour: war correspondent Lix Storm. (She lives up to it.)\n\nMagnetic Attitude on Community. A.K.A. Magnitude.\n\nSupernatural: Sam and Dean Winchester. \"Like the rifle.\"\n\nTaking the cool factor one step further, one alternate universe episode had the brothers as total strangers Dean Smith and Sam Wesson. That's right, Smith&Wesson\n\nI defy you to tell me James Tiberius Kirk is not an awesome name of awesome even without his rank of Captain.\n\nIn Stargate SG-1, one of Earth's early allies was Supreme Commander Thor of the Asgard. Somewhat subverted since Thor is about three or four feet tall and frail. Still an awesome name and it still fits him since his fleet could crush just about anyone.\n\nMusic[]\n\nGuy-Manuel de Homem-Christo\n\nLupe Fiasco's character Michael Young History, who then becomes The Cool.\n\nEnglebert Humperdinck.\n\nDr. Phineas Waldolf Steel.\n\nThe stage names of Steampunk band The Extraordinary Contraptions: Aelus von Stadberg, Dimitri von Stadberg, Sephora Bostwick, and Corbin Welch. (Their real names are Alex Stadler, David Tyberg, Sharon Burdick, and Kevin Guthrie, respectively).\n\nCedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez.\n\nDoyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein, the Stage Name of a former Misfits guitarist.\n\nEdward Lodewijk Van Halen, and his son (and current Van Halen bassist), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart William Van Halen.\n\nThe song \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" gives us Virgil Caine.\n\nGreen Day's drummer has either his real name (Frank Edwin Wright III) or his stage name (Tré Cool).\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong (an Awesome McCoolname by itself) named his youngest son Jakob Danger Armstrong.\n\nNikki Sixx, and Mick Mars from Motley Crue.\n\nSixx's birth name is Frank Ferrana, which is still an awesome name for a rock star.\n\nToo bad he didn't name himself Frank Piranha.\n\nInverted by Eminem's real name, Marshall Mathers.\n\nPlayed Straight by Marilyn Manson and inverted by his real name, Brian Warner.\n\nBritt Daniel, singer for indie rock band Spoon, records solo under the name Drake Tungsten\n\nProgressive rock band The Dear Hunter's singer goes by the rather awesome name of Casey Crescenzo.\n\nThe vocalist for E.S. Posthumus' Cartographer is Luna Sans, which can be translated as \"without moon\".\n\nThe song \"Jimmy Recard\". The whole premise is how much cooler his life would be if he just had a cooler name than Paul.\n\nHip-hop artist Taio Cruz. Todd in the Shadows agrees.\n\nMotorhead's Ian Fraser Kilmister. So badass The Other Wiki simply labels his page \"Lemmy\".\n\nUnknown Hinson\n\nNergal, Inferno, Orion and Seth from Behemoth\n\nSinger/songwriter Eagle-Eye Cherry. That is in fact his birth name: He got it because when he was a baby, he looked at his father for the first time with only one eye open. The name can cause a sort of inversion of I Am Not Shazam, since \"Eagle-Eye Cherry\" just sounds more like a band name than it does a solo artist.\n\nHeavy metal guitarist Guy Mann-Dude. Apparently it's not a stage name.\n\nVoltaire (the singer, not the philosopher) takes his stage name from his given middle name. His full name is actually Aurelio Voltaire Hernández.\n\nThe saxophonist who played the iconic solo in Gerry Rafferty’s \"Baker Street\" is named Raphael Ravenscroft.\n\nCan a pair of names count? Here's the interesting duet of Church and Winehouse.\n\nUp and coming rapper Theophilus London.\n\nThe song \"The Legend of Finn MacCumhail\" by the Dropkick Murphys...which is also known by the name \"The Legend of Finn MacCool\".\n\nThe lead vocalist of Welsh rock band Super Furry Animals is called Gruff Rhys.\n\nHighly divisive singer Lana Del Rey has this in spades. Just say it: \"Lana Del Rey.\" Doesn't that feel good?\n\nHer birth name, though, is rather average: Elizabeth Grant. One can kinda see why she changed it, especially with her Embarrassing Middle Name of Woolridge.\n\nJohn Rich of Country Music duo Big & Rich has two sons: Cash and Colt. That's right, Cash Rich.\n\nCountry music band Diamond Rio, named after models of truck.\n\nJoannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. \"Joannes Chrysostomus\" is for the saint's day he was born on. \"Wolfgang\" was his grandfather's name. \"Theophilus\" means \"beloved of God.\" Mozart is a family name which originates from the root words \"motz\" and \"hart,\" which mean \"stupid\" and \"tough.\"\n\nDierks Bentley is a pretty cool name too. That's his birth name, even.\n\nMyths and Religion[]\n\nFionn Mac Cumhaill, a hero of Irish mythology, whose name is pronounced \"Finn McCool.\"\n\nCu Chulainn is an Irish hero whose name means \"the Hound of Culann.\"\n\nThis name was given to him when he ripped apart the blacksmith's (Culann) guard dog with his bare hands as a young boy. As a punishment he offered to take its place until a successor could be reared.\n\nAnd from Jewish mythology: the angel known as Metatron!\n\nNewspaper Comics[]\n\nPeanuts: Joe Cool, anyone?\n\nLampshaded in this comic. Well... sort of, anyway.\n\nRadio[]\n\nTrue Capitalist Radio gives us Ghost.\n\nTabletop Games[]\n\nA lot of NPCs in The World of Darkness have unconventional names. Most of them have some reason for it; vampires and changelings try to divorce themselves from their old mortal identities, Prometheans never had mortal identities in the first place and often just grab what sounds fitting, werewolves often take \"deed names\" to reflect great acts, and mages take \"shadow names\" to keep others from using their true names against them. And Sin-Eaters? They're just that awesome.\n\nIn Scion, another RPG by our friends at White Wolf, you play as the child of a God—Hera, Loki, etc. For whatever reason, example characters have this odd tendency towards weird, unlikely names referencing their divine parent, even from a slant—such as Horace Farrow, son of... Horus.\n\nExalted gives us such varied names as Harmonious Jade, Seven Devils Clever, Excessively Righteous Blossom, Chejop Kejak, Tammiz Ushun, Ma-Ha-Suchi, Lilith, The Lover Clad In The Raiment Of Tears, The Bodhisattva Anointed By Dark Water, the Bull of the North... It's justified, though, in that the main characters and most of their opponents are legendary figures who are practically expected to have a mythic reputation.\n\nDungeons & Dragons\n\nD&D3 and later gives a list of sample names with each race, and sometimes...\n\nPlayers who create Warforged characters are encouraged to use names like Relic, Sigil, Wall, Shield, and Bastion. They did not have a name when first created. Now freed, Warforged tend to look for words that they feel \"represent\" them to use as name. The King of Breland's former bodyguard was called Bulwark for example.\n\nDragonborn of Bahamut (The 3.5e version, who are members of other races that undergo a voluntary transformation) are encouraged to take a new Draconic name. Draconic is one of the few D&D Races with an actually lexicon, so you can actually name yourself \"Platinum Strongscale who killed the big mean red dragon\" without sounding like a tool.\n\n4th edition, characters from the Wangsty half-demonic Tiefling race are instructed by the rulebook to take names like \"Suffering\" or \"Melancholy\" and so forth. To be fair, they also get \"Art\", \"Hope\" and... \"Gladness\"?!?\n\nForgotten Realms had ancient mad wizard Halaster Blackcloak. The given name was Hilather, but he thought \"Halaster\" sounds cool.\n\nAlso from the Realms, The Simbul. Her real name is Alassra Shentrantra Silverhand (which is, itself, pretty cool) but she took her current title from the name of a deity who was worshiped by primitive humans. Whatever the case, the sound of it is not only cool, it strikes fear into the hearts of the evil Red Wizards of Thay, because, simply put, you do not want to mess with her.\n\nJim Darkmagic of the New Hampshire Darkmagics, created by Gabe for his first ever D&D session (he astounded the seasoned players by rolling 20s).\n\n\"Why don't you just name yourself Chet AwesomeLaser?\"\n\nScott Kurtz, the guy playing a Dwarf character, was encouraged by Tycho to alliterate with his name, claiming that Dwarves lose abilities if they don't alliterate.\n\nThe whole crew have awesome names, Tycho is Ominifis Earwahr Dran, Gabe is the aforementioned Jim Darkmagic, Scott Kutz is Binwin Bronzebottom, and Wil Wheaton is Aeofel Elhromane. Also, at one point due to the general confusion of the table Tycho thinks Scott has renamed himself \"Vanguard Crackhammer.\"\n\n\"Lord Baron Whoopass Von Badass\".\n\nOne of the original 800 Clan warriors in BattleTech is Kami Sword, and perhaps the most famous mercenary in the series is Grayson Death Carlyle, who proceeded to name his unit \"The Gray Death Legion.\"\n\nOne famous Inner Sphere mercenary's name is Grayson Death Carlyle, and his mercenary squad is named the Gray Death Legion.\n\nObviously, like a half of all names in any Warhammer Fantasy Battle game counts.\n\nThe NERO (actually a live action RPG) rulebook offers an example of a bad character history featuring \"Nightblade Deathbringer Doomforge.\"\n\nIron Kingdomsnumerous characters have awesome names, Lord Commander Stryker, Kommander Sorscha, Major Marcus \"Siege\" Brisbane, Vladimir the dark champion...and more.\n\nTheater[]\n\nElphaba Thropp from the musical Wicked.\n\nFiyero Tiggular and Nessarose Thropp should count as well!\n\nRum Tum Tugger, Munkustrap, Mr Mistofelees, Skimbleshanks and Jennyanydots from the musical Cats.\n\nSeaweed Stubbs and Motormouth Maybelle from the musical Hairspray.\n\nMary Sunshine from the musical Chicago.\n\nRoxie Hart, too.\n\nKiller Queen and Scaramouche from the musical We Will Rock You.\n\nRoger Elizabeth DeBris and Ulla Inga tor Hansen Benson Yansen Tallen Hallen Svaden Swanson Bloom from The Producers.\n\nThe protagonist of The Pillowman is named Katurian Katurian Katurian. His parents were odd people.\n\nLeaf Coneybear in The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, who comes from a hippie family. His siblings are named Marigold, Brooke, Pinecone, Raisin, Landscape, and Paul.\n\nAn unintentional example in Fiddler on the Roof. Lazar (yes, pronounced \"laser\") Wolf might be a perfectly innocuous Jewish name in context, but to modern audiences it might suggest an American Gladiators reject or a Rob Liefeld character who never made it to print.\n\nJean Valjean from Les Misérables\n\nToys[]\n\nSuper-stretchy superhero Stretch Armstrong\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nAmaterasu's title of Ōkami depending on how you spell it in Japanese can either mean \"Great God\" or \"Wolf\". This pun is actually carried into gameplay when people who believe in you can see your celestial markings, and people who don't believe in you just see a white wolf.\n\nGuybrush Threepwood from the Monkey Island games.\n\nLampshaded in the first game, when his name is ridiculed by a pirate called Mancomb Seepgood.\n\nThe third game gave us Slappy Cromwell, who was told that his given name didn't have \"star quality.\"\n\nValkenhayn R. Hellsing. BlazBlue has plenty of awesome names, like Bang Shishigami, but the probably-werewolf Battle Butler really takes the cake.\n\nZelda actually subverts this trope: no matter how Badass he is, you have to admit that \"Link\" isn't exactly an awe-inspiring name. Ganondorf, on the other hand...\n\nIs that why Nintendo keeps allowing players to change Link's name?\n\nThe Legend Of Zelda The Legend Of Zelda The Wind Waker gives us King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule, the Nintendo gallery Lampshades this\n\nFlint Paper from Sam and Max Freelance Police.\n\nThe eponymous Duke Nukem.\n\nImpossible Creatures gives us Rex Chance. Science tells us that this is the manliest name possible.\n\nTekken's Marshall Law (a play on \"Martial Law\"). Admittedly, this isn't an obvious one.\n\nDon't forget his buddy Paul Phoenix, which sounds like something out of a 70s airport novel. Ditto for Bryan Fury. Craig Marduk also qualifies—it's not a wise idea to pick a fight with a guy named after a god, of all things.\n\nIf at all possible, Craig Marduk looks even more intimidating than his name sounds. His appearance is based on Nathan Jones who, during his time in prison, earned the nickname \"The Colossus of Boggo Road.\" During a prison riot, he managed to rip his cell door off of the hinges.\n\nPretty much every character in Ace Attorney has an incredibly badass name! Phoenix Wright himself may have had debatably the most awesome name of all in the Ace Attorney series, and that's saying something with people named Maya Fey and Miles Edgeworth and Franziska von Karma in the same zip code, until Apollo Justice came along, and with him people with names such as Shadi Enigmar, and Kristoph and Klavier Gavin.\n\nAlso the famed rivals Juan Corrida (Corrida is a bullfighting term) and Matt Engarde (Engarde is a fencing term).\n\nDon't forget Max Galactica (although his real name is Billy-Bob Johns), Magnifi and his daughter, Thalassa Gramarye and Tyrell Badd.\n\nWIIILL POOOWERS, HE'S THE MAN WHOSE NAME YOU'D LOVE TO TOOOOOOOOOOOOUCH\n\nThe flagship character of the Purple Moon games is named \"Rockett Movado\". This has an in-game explanation in that her parents were hippies (her siblings are named Jasper and Juno Artemis). The only other \"odd\" name belongs to Token Minority Arrow (and that's a nickname).\n\nThe various codenames in Metal Gear Solid, to the point that some normal names are excluded.\n\nCaptain Falcon, along with most other characters from F-Zero.\n\nUntil you realize his full name is actually Douglas Jay Falcon.\n\nThis still fits the trope considering that his name is Captain D.J. Falcon. It's like the ultimate disc jockey name.\n\nThe Super Robot Wars series often uses this.\n\nJustified Trope with Cliana Rimskaya, where her first name is a Portmanteau of two separate names she uses due to multiple personality disorder.\n\nW17 at first have to come up with a much more civil name to better infiltrate the opposing group. She picked 'Lamia Loveless'.\n\nEscape Velocity has some fun with this in regard to the default name for the main character—random possibilities include Rick Hardslab and Stud Beefpile. Given that the game is packed with Mystery Science Theater 3000 Shout Outs, this may well be a reference to the Space Mutiny Running Gag.\n\nUsed for effect in No More Heroes. Travis Touchdown was given his name because (as Goichi Suda claims), it sounds cool in Japan, but lame in America, a perfect representation of Travis.\n\nAccording to the sequel's Japanese website, Henry's full name is Henry Cooldown.\n\nStar Ocean: Till the End of Time and Star Ocean: The Last Hope do this with their respective main characters named Fayt Leingod (surely they couldn't have meant \"Reingold\") and Edge Maverick.\n\nMax Payne. Lampshaded by a Mook, who admits to envying Max's name.\n\nMona Sax.\n\nThe fictional Dick Justice.\n\nWilliam J. Blazkowicz (the protagonist of Wolfenstein 3D) and his grandson Billy Blaze (better known as Commander Keen). Granted, William's name takes a turn for the Sucky name territory when it's shortened into BJ Blazkowicz. Just don't tell him that to his face.\n\nThe Suikoden series has Running Mythology Gag Schtoltenheim Reinbach III. Oh, and Suikoden III gives us Nefentitiri Radames Ampenhetep Iruiktanas Antikoseus Puto Remaios Kureakias Dimetirios Farasmuseian Ishak Saraj Amenenuhet Atomes Hatshepsut Toto Ank Amen Hortez VII.\n\nSuikoden IV actually GAVE us Schtoltenheim Reinbach III as a recruitable character! Imagine the surprise on peoples faces when they saw that the guy actually EXISTED.\n\nClassic adventure game Wasteland lets you name your starting party whatever you want, but the default names are Hell Razor, Angela Deth, Thrasher, and Snake Vargas.\n\nCarmen Sandiego\n\nIn Strong Bads Cool Game for Attractive People, episode 4, there is a character, who is Homestar Runner as \"Dangeresque, Too?\", as a robot copy of the character, by the name of Uzi Bazooka. Even Strong Bad/Dangeresque thinks it's a cool name. (But then again, he did write the script..)\n\nFinal Fantasy VII seems to be a weird subversion of this trope... Until you see their surnames. \"Tifa Lockheart\", \"Vincent Valentine\", \"Aerith Gainsborough\", \"Red XIII\"/ Nanaki... Cloud Strife also manages to overcome his otherwise improbable name by being incredibly Badass. Oh, and they're fighting Sephiroth. The only really normal one is \"Barret Wallace\".\n\nBarret in Japanese is Baretto, which is how you pronounce \"bullet\" in Japanese so he definitely qualifies for Awesome McCoolname. Sephiroth or Sephirot are the 10 attributes/emanations through which God can manifest in Jewish Kabbalah. However, there's also brothers Nero and Weiss in Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII (Black and White respectively).\n\n\"Cid Highwind\" is an awesome name that just automatically commands respect when you hear it.\n\nCloud's Shadow Archetype Zack Fair has a pretty cool name also.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII has the main character named Lightning. That's...that's just great.\n\n\"Lightning\" is just her code name. Her real name is Eclair Farron, or just Claire in the English localization. Guess what that means in French? No, not the pastry. It means \"lightning\". The reason behind her going by \"Lightning\" is a plot point.\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII qualifies too: Squall Leonhart? Rinoa Heartilly? Seifer Almasy, Laguna Loire, Kiros Seagill, Ward Zabac, Edea, Ultimecia?\n\nFinal Fantasy XII gives us some gems in the form of Vayne Solidor, Basch fon Ronsenburg, and King Raithwall. The Imperial Judges get some sweet names too, like Gabranth and Zargabaath, but those are assumed names.\n\nVaan's name was Van in the Japanese version too.\n\nAnd let's not forget Final Fantasy IX, which gives us Zidane, Dagger, Steiner, and Amarant.\n\nDon't forget Ruby and Blank from Tantalus. Oh, and Lord Puck of Burmecia. Amarant in Japanese is Salamander Coral, too, which means his nickname in that version is \"The Flaming Salamander\".\n\nFinal Fantasy X has names like Tidus, Yuna, Auron, Wakka, Kimahri, and Rikku with Lulu being the only normal sounding name of the main cast of characters.\n\nFinal Fantasy V has Butz Klauser, changed to Bartz in the English release for obvious reasons.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI. Even if most characters don't have really astounding names, we still have Clyde Arrowny A.K.A. Shadow, Cyan Garamonde or Kefka Palazzo.\n\nSo many characters in World of Warcraft (and presumably other MMORPGs) have those, it's not even awesome anymore. The whole game is loaded with Doomhowls and Deatheyes and Nightwhispers etc.\n\nNote that most, if not all of those are clan-names or at least family names. It makes sense for an orc or ogre clan to pick an intimidating name.\n\nFor what it's worth, more family-friendly games may enforce this: both Fusion Fall and Free Realms use a name generator as the default; in Free Realms at least you can make up your own name but it has to be approved.\n\nGuilty Gear: Sol Badguy, Slayer, Millia Rage, Axl Low, Potemkin, Kliff Undersn, and Justice.\n\nUpcoming Team Ico game The Last Guardian is known in Japan as \"Hitokui Ōwashi Trico,\" which can be translated as \"Trico, the Man-Eating Sea-Eagle.\"\n\nIn the Soul Series, there are quite a few examples. Heishiro Mitsurugi, Rock Adams, Cervantes De Leon, Dampierre, and Hildegard \"Hilde\" von Krone are stand out examples.\n\nLuke Skywalker may have avoided the last name \"Starkiller,\" but Galen Marek of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed did not escape being called \"Starkiller\" pretty much the entire game.\n\nAnd even before him, there was Bendak Starkiller. Neo Crusader, Bounty Hunter and Deathmatch Champion.\n\nAnd, of course, who can forget Carmageddon, and the lovely protagonists Max Damage and Die Anna, though the latter is half this and half a Punny Name.\n\nMayor McGovern from Brave Fencer Musashi, and many, many more.\n\nStreet Fighter is practically made of these.\n\nChun Li. When somebody is named after the most famous female martial artist ever, plus the most famous male martial artist as well, you know she isn't messing around.\n\nBalrog.\n\nAlso Vega named after a star, Ryu which means dragon, and Ken Masters which is basically calling someone a sword master.\n\nCrimson Viper, that is all.\n\nSlim Cognito from Ratchet and Clank. Even if it is a Punny Name.\n\nAlso, Skid McMarx.\n\nChaos Legion's Sieg Wahrheit (win and truth) and Victor Delacroix (champion of the cross).\n\nNathan Drake of the Uncharted series.\n\nTrauma Team features an orthopedist named Hank Freebird, who also happens to be a Made of Iron part-time superhero.\n\nStarCraft sports some rather interesting contrast in its Terran names, but the standout for coolness is General Horace Warfield.\n\nIn Mass Effect, whatever goofy first name that may be given to him (or her, for that matter), there is something just so intrinsically panty wetting about the moniker Commander Shepard.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts we have Organization XIII, made up of thirteen Nobodies, and each and every one has an awesome name: We have Xemnas, Xibgar, Xaldin, Vexen, Lexaeus, Zexion, Saïx, Axel, Demyx, Luxord, Marluxia, Larxene, Roxas, and finally, for 358/2 Days, Xion. Most of the names are justified because when a person with a strong will is turned into a humanoid Nobody, Xemnas recruits them and gives them a new name by scrambling the letters and adding an 'x' into it. Even then, quite a few had less-than-average names, with Vexen's (Even) being the most common.\n\nAvalon Centrifuge, from LittleBigPlanet 2.\n\nIn the Sonic the Hedgehog series, we have the title character Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \"Tails\" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Shadow the Hedgehog, Silver the Hedgehog, Amy Rose, Rouge the Bat, Dr. Ivo \"Eggman\" Robotnik, and many more.\n\nKeep in mind that Mega Man is also known as Rockman. Also keep in mind that his little sister is known as Roll. Rock and Roll anyone?\n\nThen in the Mega Man X series, his newer model was just known as X with Zero as the Proto Man counterpart.\n\nPretty much all of the robot masters and mavericks fall under this description, with a few exceptions.\n\nWild ARMs took this trope home and married it: Jack Van Burace, Ashley Winchester, Gallows Carradine, the list goes on.\n\nTales of the Abyss: though they rarely use them Guy, Tear, and Van birth names are Gailardia Galan Gardios, Mysterica Aura Fende and Vandelesca Musto Fende.\n\nPokémon Black and White has \"Roggenrola\". Yes, a Rock-type Pokémon named after Rock and Roll!\n\nThere's also the Dragon-type Pokémon with axe-blades for its teeth, \"Haxorus\", which may also incorporate Leet Lingo in the name as well.\n\nAdditionally, the Water-type specialist Gym Leader of Pastoria City from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, Crasher Wake (with an equally awesome Japanese name, Maximum Mask).\n\nThe champion of the third generation in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire is named Steven Stone. That's a hardcore name with bonus points for alliteration.\n\nNo More Heroes 1 and 2 give us Travis Touchdown, Henry Cooldown, Dr. Letz Shake, Harvey Moisewich Volodarski, Thunder Ryu, Bishop Shidux, Count Townshend, Margaret Moonlight, and Alice Twilight. And this isn't even counting code names such as Shinobu, Million Gunman, Destroyman, Dark Star, Dr. Peace, Speed Buster...the list goes on.\n\nThe Shadows of Persona 3 have a lot of cool names. Death Castle, Conviction Sword, Slaughter Drive, Void Giant...and the list goes on and on.\n\nTales of Hearts gives us Zex Meteoryte. Think about it for a second.\n\nHawke, from Dragon Age 2. If you're going to set the player character's last name, better make it an awesome one.\n\nThe Qunari don't have names, just titles, but the Arishok definitely takes the cake in this regard.\n\nFenris. It's not his real name, though, and was given to him by his master to help scare people.\n\nMocked in the Mark of the Assassin DLC; the party is ambushed after speaking to a contact named Edge. Isabela remarks, \"Well, that's what you get for talking to a man named Edge,\" whereas Anders just says \"Edge? That's his NAME?\"\n\nGarcia Fucking Hotspur, from Shadows of the Damned. It's left ambiguous as to whether \"Fucking\" is his actual middle name.\n\nMagical Starsign gives us General Knucklestorm.\n\nThe Demon Rush has such names as Cherry Venus, Alberto Mundosold, Kent Buckle, and of course, Brooks Cracktackle.\n\nTouhou is chock-full of these, especially in Japanese. The Western-sounding coolnames includes Lyrica and Layla Prismriver, Wriggle Nightbug, Mystia Lorelei, and Star Sapphire. The Japanese ones are:\n\nYouki and Youmu Konpaku: \"Kon\" and \"paku\" refer to different parts of Anatomy of the Soul. They are half-ghosts.\n\nEirin Yagokoro: When you're an immortal genius, your name reflects it: \"Intelligence of eternally clear brightness over infinitely extended area\".\n\nShikieiki Yamaxanadu: four-seasons-reflection-princess, paradise's-judge-of-the-dead (although the second part apparently is a title).\n\nShou Toramaru: star tiger-circle. Also, \"-maru\" postfix makes one's name sounds more Badass and manly (she is a Bifauxnen).\n\nCharacters with archaic-sounding names: Fujiwara no Mokou, Mononobe no Futo, Toyosatomimi no Miko.\n\nIn Might and Magic VI, you can have your party have names like \"Roderic\", \"Diana\", \"Tracy\" and \"Zoltan\". Also crosses with Aerith and Bob.\n\nWarhammer 40k: Dawn of War and its sequel are full of these names, especially with the human characters. Gabriel Angelos, Isador Akios, Mordecai Toth...\n\nPrincess Sveta Czamaral, of the Fang Tribe of Morgal, from Golden Sun: Dark Dawn. Bonus points for being one of the only two Golden Sun characters with a canonly-known surname... the other being her brother.\n\nDisgaea has loads of characters with cool names, like Valvatorez and Axel, which may be expected since most Disgaea characters are demons. Still, when you're a human with a name like Almaz von Almandine Adamant that's pretty awesome.\n\nAltair ibn La'Ahad from Assassin's Creed. His name basically translates to \"the bastard eagle.\"\n\nAnghel Higure (\"higure\" spelled in Japanese with two Kanjii meaning 'red') in Hatoful Boyfriend is a parody. He has the real name Akagi Yoshio, but insists on being called Anghel due to believing he is a ridiculous fantasy character with the title \"Crimson Angel of Judecca\".\n\nA few examples in Dota 2:\n\nBanehallow von Ambry, the Lycanthrope\n\nDarkterror, the Faceless Void\n\nRazor, the Lightning Revenant\n\nPurist Thunderwrath, the Omniknight\n\nWeb Comics[]\n\nIn The Adventures of Dr. McNinja, the eponymous Dr. McNinja. A doctor of medicine who comes from a family of Irish ninjas. Nothing else need be said.\n\nDragon Tails has the character named Enigma. It certainly doesn't help that he's a total Badass.\n\nBoy Meets Boy and the sequel webcomic, Friendly Hostility. Harlequin, Tybalt, Anubis, Cyanide, and many more. (There's Skids, but that's a nickname.) Also notable is Collin, who inexplicably has a Hindi last name despite his family being hardcore Caucasian conservative Christians. Word of God has it that at one point, Collin's parents traveled to India on missionary work, so they probably took a local name. This is probably because the Boy Meets Boy characters were based loosely on characters from an old and now-deleted webcomic by the same author, which was about vampires (or rather gay vampire angels), who are kind of expected to have names like that. Frankly, you can't blame Mikhail's tattoo artist for making a mistake.\n\nThe Broken Mirror has Ariad Engel Moira. The last one claims her real name is Ariad Smith, and that she changed it because it was too boring—but she's still named Ariad.\n\nSuicide for Hire: the main characters are named Arcturus Winrock and Hunter Ravenwood. Hunter's occasionally-appearing love interest is named Chryseis, and Arcturus' co-workers in the food stand storyline were named Zharra, Morph, Magdalena, Tajaira, and Shileen. The briefly-appearing \"Harv\" and \"Sarah\" in a previous storyline seemed quite out-of-place.\n\nRonin Galaxy: the main character's name is Cecil Onimaru, which (given the multiple meanings of Japanese names) can litterally mean, \"Oni's son.\" or \"Oni-like son.\" For being a ronin, such a name seems extravagant. Also Leona Gallant — she couldn't possibly be a gallant knight, could she?\n\nKeychain of Creation gives us the relatively ordinary (for an Abyssal Exalted) \"The Most Secret and Sorrowful of the Bearers of the Endless Destiny of All Creation Which Wander Amidst Forgotten Sights and Fallen Tears Along the Tread of Ancient Ashen Footsteps Through the Shadow of That Which Comes and Into That Riotous Cacophony Which Births All Fools and Steals All Beauty, Who Heralds Through Her Silence the Stillness and Chill of Those Who Were Not Born and Who Will Not Fade 'til All Things Fall and... In That Most Grim Harvest Form the... Final Restful Tomb of... All Awakened Life and... All the... Sleep... less... De--\" (passes out from lack of breath). Everyone calls her Secret.\n\nXkcd: the student in Exploits of a Mom and according to Alt Text, his sister (who goes by her middle name, \"Elaine\").\n\nMax Facepuncher... Yeah... And I think Jack Cannon, the title character, counts too.\n\nThe main cast of Sluggy Freelance? They go by the names Torg, Riff, Zoe, Gwynn, Bun-Bun, and Kiki. Hanging around with these people, you can kinda understand why Sam felt he had to change his name to \"Sam da Man.\"\n\nCrushestro.\n\nMost of Hereti-corp has awesome names like Daedalus Hereti, Dr. Killum, Dan-Met, Kusari and Oasis. Irving Schlock? Not so much.\n\nGoblins: Life Through Their Eyes. While goblins have names such as \"Big Ears\" and \"Complains Of Names\", one of them, \"Fumbles\", wants to become an adventurer (a PC, indeed) and changes his name to Senor Vorpal Kickasso.\n\nThe goblins are named by their village elder, who chooses their names based on a vision of their fate that she sees when they are born. For instance, the goblin who grows up to become the chief of the clan is named \"Chief\". However, one unfortunate goblin was given the name \"Dies Horribly\".\n\nVan Von Hunter.\n\nIn Everyday Heroes, Mr. Mighty's name is actually Marion John Mighty.\n\nJane Mighty's mom was born Hannah Anne Combat; she had a sister, Ariel Combat. Their father was Mortimer Lawrence (or \"Mort L.\") Combat.\n\nGirl Genius is loaded with awesome names, starting with Agatha's primary love interest: Gilgamesh Wulfenbach.\n\nOr Agatha's aunt, Demonica Mongfish. See how the first name turns even mundane last into something Lovecraftian?\n\nLackadaisy is full of these names like Rocky Rickaby, Calvin \"Freckle\" Mac Murray, Mitzy May, Dorian \"Zib\" Zibowski, Ivy Pepper, Nicodeme Savoy, Serafine Savoy, Moredecai Heller, and many more.\n\nNarbonic: one of Helen Narbon's recurring enemies is Dr. Lupin Madblood. No, that's his real name, and he even has a PhD. On the other hand, he still lived with his mother during a lot of the story.\n\nEl Goonish Shive: Pandora Chaos Raven. That is all.\n\nPenny Arcade: \"'I am Grimm Shado,' said Grimm Shado. 'And I'm here to take it to the limit.'\n\nAnd, to a lesser extent, Dr. Raven Darktalon Blood.\n\nHow about Jim Darkmagic?\n\nEveryone from The Song of the Sorcelator apparently has a name like this, though we only get to know Grimm Shado's.\n\nParodied in Hark! A Vagrant. The Brontë sisters, concerned they won't be taken seriously as women authors, choose the pseudonyms \"Johnny Guns,\" \"Bruce Punisher\" and \"Daddy Smash.\"\n\nCutter Edgewise in Starslip. Memnon Vanderbeam may also count.\n\n8-Bit Theater has names like Fighter McWarrior, Black Mage Evilwizardington, Prince Elf of Clan Khee'bler (a.k.a. Thief), Red Mage Statscowski, Prince Drizz'l of the Dark Elves, Vilbert von Vampire, Muffin the dragon, Chancellor Usurper of Clan Sahn'ta (real name King Astos of the Dark Elves), Dr. Swordopolis, Doctor Malpractice, Generic Half-Elven Dual-Class Ranger, Berserker Axinhed... It's a freaking gold mine of this trope! Not to mention that Fighter, Black Mage, Thief, Red Mage, White Mage, Black Belt, etc. are actually their REAL NAMES and not just their classes...\n\nIn Homestuck, the four main characters' names were all suggestions provided by readers, so awesome names like \"Jade Harley\", \"Rose Lalonde\" and \"Dave Strider\" were inevitable.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether \"John Egbert\" sounds cool or not though.\n\nThe Trolls mostly have cool names, such as Karkat Vantas, Vriska Serket, and Sollux Captor.[1] For bonus points, they're all meaningful.\n\nLord English gives us an interesting example of this trope- his name is written in green and requires an animated gif to be written properly.\n\nTwo of his minions also have names that beautifully paint the medium: Doc Scratch and Snowman. All the other members of The Felt, and the gang itself, have names that are written in green.\n\nVriska'a FLARP name is Marquise Spinneret Mindfang. We later find out that she named herself after her Famous Ancestor.\n\nThere's also Eridan's FLARP name, Orphaner Dualscar. It turns out that he named his character after his ancestor.\n\nAll of the ancestors have ridiculously cool names: Neophyte Redglare (Who Terezi's FLARP character is named after and is her ancestor), Expatriate Darkleer, the Grand Highblood...\n\nJohn names his \"adopted\" salamander Casey. Rose names her/him Viceroy Bubbles Von Salamancer.\n\nRose has a talent for this: she names her mutant kitten Vodka Mutini\n\nLet's not forget Jack Noir, who also goes by Sovereign Slayer.\n\nThere's also Jack's In-Universe Expy Spades Slick.\n\nAnd now we have Jake English.\n\nDead Winter has an assassin that goes by the name Black Monday Blues. He has a colleague named Sixgun Johnny Rhythm.\n\nGunnerkrigg Court has Antimony Carver, Surma Carver (nee Stibnite), Zeta, Gamma, and Winsbury...\n\nIn Regular Guy, Reg decides he needs to get to know a girl better because of her name: Katie DeLorean.\n\nEerie Cuties gave good part of cast pretty cool names, what with most of them meeting in All-Ghouls School... called \"Charybdis Heights\", by the way.\n\nIn Voodoo Walrus most character names seem to be more like alias or online handles, so this is rather prominent in names like Rip Flintlock, Shmeerm, Miriam Cyradwee, and of course Villemous Quetzacoatl Creep Knight\n\nIn The Adventures of Shan Shan, Cassiopeia. The teacher has to work to pronounce it.\n\nZokusho Comics: Serge (pronounced like surge) Inverse. Nitrous Blight. Rot"
