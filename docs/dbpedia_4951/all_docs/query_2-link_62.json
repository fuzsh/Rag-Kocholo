        "text": "- ASPEN - Fans of the wickedly subversive \"Fernwood 2-Night\" will be thrilled to learn of the recent discovery of the talk-show parody's lost episodes.\n\nAll 6,000 of them.\n\n\"We've continued to do the show all these years,\" deadpanned Fred Willard, who played the brilliantly dimwitted sidekick Jerry Hubbard alongside Martin Mull's bombastic host Barth Gimble in 1977-78. \"We've been on in smaller television markets, but it just hasn't been playing in the major markets.\"\n\nThis weekend, two \"Fernwood 2-Night\" episodes will originate from Aspen, which may be one of the nation's smallest television markets, but is once again the center of the comedic universe.\n\nToday through Saturday, the seventh annual HBO-sponsored U.S. Comedy Arts Festival will draw some of the industry's biggest names, including Billy Crystal, Bob Newhart and Steve Martin.\n\nThen there's Barth and Jerry, who are bringing \"Fernwood 2-Night\" to Aspen for an entirely different reason: Miss Nude Aspen.\n\n\"The reason we're here is that the Aspen people have asked us to start an annual award for the person who has contributed the most to television comedy,\" Willard says. \"Miss Nude Aspen will be on hand to give the first award, which of course will go to Barth.\"\n\nThe trip to Aspen, he adds, has been financed by the president of the Bun 'N Run restaurant chain, played by Larry Miller. \"Larry's character is named Skip Hitler,\" Willard says. \"Of course we'll ask him if he ever thought of changing his name to Jack or Tom or Bill, because Skip is obviously not an appropriate name for a grown man.\"\n\nSounds just like old times.\n\nFor the uninitiated, \"Fernwood 2-Night\" ran for 125 episodes as a summer replacement for \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.\"\n\nBen Stein ( \"Win Ben Stein's Money'') had the idea to set a talk show on an Ohio public-access television station with local guests. The host was Barth Gimble, whose twin, Garth, impaled himself on an aluminum Christmas tree on \"Mary Hartman.\"\n\nCreated by Norman Lear ( \"All in the Family'') and produced by Alan Thicke ( \"Growing Pains''), it was lewd, crude, absurd and brilliant.\n\nHow crude? On the first episode, which aired July 4, 1977, Barth invited a Jewish man whose car has broken down in Fernwood to be a guest because he was quite certain no one in town had ever spoken \"to a person of the Jewish persuasion.\"\n\nIn a segment Barth called \"Talk to a Jew,\" Felix Fisher took phone questions such as, \"When is Barbara Streisand's next movie coming out?\" Hubbard asked Fisher, \"What tribe are you from?\"\n\nIn the second episode, a pianist with an iron lung played upside down and backward while young Baby Irene tap-danced alongside while singing \"I Didn't Know the Gun Was Loaded.\"\n\nTelevision was never the same. In 1978, the show was renamed \"America 2-Night\" and moved to California because so many celebrities wanted to guest star, including Robin Williams, Charlton Heston and Gary Burghoff. When Heston appeared, Hubbard repeatedly interrupted him and eventually sent him off to get him a soda.\n\nNearly 25 years later, Willard won raves for playing another vapid sidekick in \"Best in Show.\"\n\nMull and Willard will perform one-hour versions of \"Fernwood 2-Night\" at 5 p.m. Thursday and 10 p.m. Friday at Aspen's Wheeler Opera House. Lear will introduce the program on Thursday; Harry Shearer ( \"The Simpsons''), who wrote Mull's monologues for the show, on Friday.\n\nThe comedy festival will feature 50 comedians and 70 events, including standup, tributes, films, plays and seminars. Highlights will include cast reunions for the seminal 1973 film \"American Graffiti\" and the groundbreaking 1990-94 TV series \"In Living Color.\"\n\n\"Both were significant to their audience at that moment in time,\" says Stu Smiley, executive director of the festival and executive producer of \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\"\n\nwhose star, Ray Romano, was a comedy-festival discovery. \"They both spoke to their audiences in a unique way that wasn't being spoken to them.\"\n\n\"American Graffiti\" was George Lucas' semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale, set in 1962. It starred Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford. Its storytelling format and pop soundtrack influenced a generation of films. Made for a mere $750,000, it grossed $115 million.\n\n\"In Living Color,\" which broke taboos with brash and cruel hilarity, was the first black ensemble show to win mainstream popularity since \"The Flip Wilson Show\" 20 years before. Stars included Keenan Ivory Wayans, Kim Coles, Tommy Davidson, Jamie Foxx, David Alan Grier and a token white guy named Jim Carrey.\n\nOther comedy-festival highlights:\n\n- Comedic legend Bob Newhart will receive the festival's top honor. His 1960 debut album was the first comedy record to go No. 1 on the Billboard charts. A year later he became the first artist to hold the top two spots in the charts, a record that would not be broken until 1991. His \"Bob Newhart Show\" and \"Newhart\" series were network television staples from 1972-90.\n\n- Actor, comedian, director and producer Billy Crystal will receive the American Film Institute's Star Award. \"I'm very honored,\" says Crystal. \"I'm joining a special group of talented and funny people (including Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin). I hope this means my cable reception will get better.\"\n\n- The annual film festival will include 20 features and 25 shorts. The highlight will be Friday's world premiere of \"One Night at McCool's,\" starring Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser, Michael Douglas and John Goodman.\n\n- Three-hour technology summits starting at 9 a.m. Thursday and Friday will explore the relationship between Hollywood, technology and the internet. Participants will include Steve Martin, Martin Short, Nora Ephron and Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nThe Post's John Moore and Bill Husted are in Aspen to cover the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. Their dispatches will appear Friday through Monday."
