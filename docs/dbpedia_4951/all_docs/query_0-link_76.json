A wonderful feel and a good pace keeps the energy levels high. No one takes themselves too seriously and they fully embrace the film’s out-there tone. Michael Douglas is great as always in a supporting role and the Falling Down reface is a nice addition. The final showdown to the YMCA is fun too!",
