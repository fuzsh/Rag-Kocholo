        "text": "Directed by Harald Zwart (Agent Cody Banks) and written by Stan Seidel — who died before the movie came out and based so much of the story on his friend’s bartender stories from Humphrey’s Restaurant & Tavern near St. Louis University — the real title of this movie should be “Everyone wants to fuck Liv Tyler.” I mean, yes, that’s crass, but that’s the point of the movie. Her character Jewel has destroyed the lives of Randy (Matt Dillon), Carl (Paul Reiser) and Detective Dehling (John Goodman), the details of which they explain in Rashomon-like fashion.\n\nEven Andrew “Dice” Clay — in the dual role of Utah and Elmo — can’t escape her or the men in her orbit, dying twice in the same film. At least Michael Douglas’ character seems to be able to win her over; Douglas was the king of these roles where he’d somehow be the one man who can tame the wildest of women.\n\nIf you’re looking for a movie that has the Tarantino influence and makes fun of the other romantic crime films of the late 90s, well…you could do worse."
