        "text": "Yep and in the deleted scene she throws the globe out of the window and it smashes into tiny pieces, I thought that ending was too harsh and the one they went with shows she does have a heart. Yeah Miachel's character only say that because of what he had been told, I bet when he left he went straight to the shops etc to buy a dvd player etc but at the same time, I wouldn't be suprised if he does have all that stuff, but what I think it is meant to show is she has found her match, a manipulator just like her, but I love that she uses her beauty and youth to full advantage, and as I do the same so I am not uses it as a derogative, but that end scene with YMCA was hilarious. This was a dark but funny comedy, and I am suprised that it didn't get as much attention as it deserved.\n\nreply share"
