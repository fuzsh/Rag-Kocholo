        "text": "The director of this movie is Harald Zwart, a Norwegian. I suppose they have to get a bit arty about movies. In an interview somewhere, he said the inspiration for One Night At McCool's was a painting by Edward Munch in which a woman was portrayed as a whore, Madonna and housewife.\n\nMunch, of course, is famous for The Scream that's become an overworked symbol of kitsch angst.\n\nThe only ones likely to scream at McCool's are feminists as Zwart's symbolical categorisation is rather rash in these politically correct days. He's made, in a way, a kind of macho wet dream. The movie's really three vignettes that revolve on three guys' sexual relationships with the impossibly beautiful, abused Jewel Valentine (Liv Tyler).\n\nEach story's told in flashback. There's Randy (Matt Dillon) the barman at McCool's, who spends the night with Jewel, thinking he's protecting her from her abusive boyfriend, Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). The plot thickens when Utah is found murdered.\n\nLeather whips and all that jazz\n\nJewel then gets involved with Detective Dehling (John Goodman) and plays the ideal wife. Then she becomes a dominatrix, leather whips and all, to lawyer Carl (Paul Reiser), Randy's cousin.\n\nRandy tells his version of the story to a hit man who plays bingo, Mr Burmeister (Michael Douglas). Douglas plays the role with a country-'n-western wig with a enormous cow's lick that makes him look like a caricature.\n\nI guess the movie's trying to show there's no fool like an inept guy trying to seduce a beautiful babe. In her way, Jewel's empowered by her looks: she's able to dominate and manipulate the guys' hormones. But somehow Zwart doesn't pull this off: Jewel stays passive, a guy's fantasy, and there's a sexist imbalance in the movie.\n\nThis isn't helped by the way it's shot. Zwart said he wanted the colours in the film to reflect Jewel's happy-go-lucky world, it's brightness. The movie does just that, but you feel you're watching a theme that needs sleaze, that needs low-down dirty comedy to work. Everything is just too cute, too bright - and harmless.\n\nIn the end, the movie looks like a sensually-lit Playboy calendar shoot ,designed to egg on male testosterone, not send up hormonal masculinity. Because criminality is part of the comical theme, the movie ends in a blood-'n-gore shoot-out.\n\nIn all fairness, this isn't the ending that Zwart or scriptwriter Stan Siedel - he died just after the film was completed - wanted. The movie was shaped by test audiences - hence, perhaps, the soft, satirical blows. Hence, perhaps, the cuteness, rather than sharp-edged sleaze.\n\nTailoring movies almost like censorship\n\nThe alternative ending will be on the DVD. Sure, in the end One Night At McCool's is pleasantly low-budget, a comedy that doesn't wander too far off the beaten track. But I can't help thinking there is something a bit dishonest about tailoring movies for audiences. I know it's standard Hollywood practice to get bums on seats, but it's also a form of censorship. The movie isn't the one the director intended.\n\nMaybe One Night At McCool's will be a better movie on DVD. It has potential. Tyler's good as Jewel, giving the character a humorous edge that's not always in the script. Dillon still looks good after all these years. Goodman's Goodman - that is, he wanders through the role with an enigmatic twitch. Reiser, too, is Reiser. His performance is really a continuation of his role in the sit-com, Mad About You.\n\nThe one who's really interesting is Douglas as the hit man. He sends himself up, looks silly, and gives the movie the kind of weirdness that it needed all the way through. And when he's the only one who does that in a comedy, you could be in trouble."
