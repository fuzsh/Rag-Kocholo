She is certainly the most popular googled McCool. In fact, I read a story that she was the most searched person on the internet in 2008. Share that with your friends–being McCool is now as popular as it can get. Sorry to say, fellas, that Michelle McCool is not related to me; well, no more than Cameron Diaz or Mary-Louise Parker.

Cameron Diaz, well, I just wanted her name in my rhyme.\n\nAnyway, my point is that Michelle McCool and I are not directly related but we must be distantly related somehow.\n\nHave the McCool-est 2009.\n\nComments? Let me know. More McCool stuff to come…"
