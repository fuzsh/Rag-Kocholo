        "text": "Hey everybody, my name is Doug and I loves movies. This is Doug loves movies not coming to you from the Rivoli in Toronto, Ontario, Canada as you could probably already tell this is an in-studio ep instead of the second show taped in Toronto during the Toronto International Film Festival Apparently there was a power surge during the taping at the Rivoli and the file the show was recorded on was lost forever I don't know anything about that kind of stuff, but that's the story. So my guests, actor J.P. Manu and comedians Jerry D. and Sean Cullen, who were all great and it was an amazing show. You can ask anyone who was there.\n\nWe learned during the episode that J.P. Manu's role as Robot Man in EuroTrip delights people more than anyone would have guessed. And that Jerry D., he has one line in some movie, is like, one, two, three, Adelaide Place or something like that. But that's totally wrong. But an address for the title of a movie, I think you're asking for trouble when it comes to the stoner crowd. asking for trouble when it comes to the stoner crowd. And Sean Cullen was great at the Leonard Maltin game, but completely baffled by the concept of Build a Title. It was amazing, and I'm sad you won't be able to hear it.\n\nBut to make up for it, I ran to the studio and scheduled studio time so that I could throw together an in-studio ep for you guys with producer Matt Belknap that you can listen to on the day that the Toronto show is supposed to come out. So let's do this. Doug hates candy wrappers, screaming baby sticky seeds with 50 azepop or kernels in his teeth. There's still not one that he won't see\n\nbecause Doug loves movies Hey everybody, you know who I am and you know what I like. This is Doug Loves Movies. Coming to you from the Earwolf Studios in Hollywoodland, California world on Thursday, September 22nd to Ocean's Eleven. I have to thank Colin Geddes of the Toronto International Film Festival for getting me into so many movies on Sunday I saw a film called Smuggler\n\nand amongst many amazing things in that movie you get to see a dying man suddenly spit a frog out of his mouth and it's set up quite nicely so spoiler you can see me at Zany's in Chicago October 15th at 4.20 the Tipsy Crow in San Diego on Wednesday, November 23rd. And all of my tour dates, as always, are at Douglovesmovies.com. Number one movie in the country right now is Lion King 3D,\n\nto which I say, get that baby lion out of my face, Rashiki. My guests today are the co-hosts of the Earwolf podcast, Who Charted. Please welcome Kulab Vialisak and Howard Kramer. How off was I? I want to know, too. Let me try. Let me try. Okay, go ahead.\n\nVialisak. That's pretty good. Vialisak. Vialisak. Vialisak. Damn it. Vialisak. Doug, you've only known me for half my life.\n\nI know, but I was worried about it all day, and I thought, do I ask her as soon as I get there so I sound awesome when I say it right, or do I just screw it all up and draw more attention to it? For 40 weeks, I've been going through the same thing, and now I know, thank you for asking. So we've done the show for 42 weeks, so the first two weeks you knew, then forgot,\n\nand now you know. I didn't worry about it. For those first two weeks, I didn't know first two weeks you knew, then forgot. I just didn't worry about it. For those first two weeks I didn't know if the show was going to keep going so I didn't worry about it. It's the least of your concerns. Because he just calls you Kulop on the show.\n\nHe doesn't try it. He calls me Kuku. Kuku, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But you know what? Most people, I don't ever say my last name. I just work with the first name.\n\nI think that's hard enough. I think it's super showbiz of you to just be Kulop, you know, to see that on a marquee someday in Vegas is going to be amazing. One word. Can you pronounce Ackerman? Do you know how to say that?\n\nAckerman? Ackerman? Ackerman. Ackerman? Acker? Ackerman? Well, now it sounds like it's Scott's podcast now. You guys are ready to be a morning team.\n\nHoward Kramer and Kulop sounds great. It's got that nice KK alliteration in there. Except we both don't wake up early. I would call that Kulop and the dragon. Oh, I like that. I like that very much. It sounds like Kulop is a little boy, though. I guess there could be...\n\nWe've reached that point where it could be a little girl and a dragon. Yeah, why not? A little girl and a rapping dragon. That would be, I think you guys should pitch that to Sprout. What's Sprout? Sprout is like the Nickelodeon for like really young kids. You could pitch it as Milan meets something good. Oh, Mulan?\n\nMulan? Mulan. I think Mulan was underrated. Let's talk about movies. Yeah, let's go right into movies. Let's get into some movie talk. Let's see if I have some questions prepared for you guys. Be a man.\n\nThat was one of the songs. Mulan. Thanks for doing this so last minute. Thanks for having us. Oh, yeah. I didn't know about the whole power surge thing. That's terrible. Yeah, it's something that I've always worried would happen at some point,\n\nthat there'd be some sort of, somebody forgot to flip a button, or I didn't know PowerSearch was an option, but I knew that there were things that could possibly go wrong. And how many episodes have we done, Matt, at this point? That's a great question. We've been doing it for five years, right? Wow. On and off.\n\nThat's pretty good. That's great. So, yeah, I think this is the first. That's not bad, five years without a question. Yeah, finally a lost episode. And it adds a little bit of myst yeah, I think this is the first, that's not bad, five years without a... Yeah, finally a lost episode. And it adds a little bit of mystique, I guess. It was a pretty amazing show, though. It's a frustrating one.\n\nYou have a really good one that, you know, now people aren't going to be able to hear it, but instead they get to hear you guys. What a treat for you listeners. Here we go. I mean, of course, you know, I would imagine a lot of the same people listen to my show and Who Charted, and you guys talk about movies on that show.\n\nDo you feel an obligation to see movies for that part of the show, or do you just sort of hope that the guests have seen a couple of them? Maybe in the beginning, felt a little obligation, but then found there was a way around it. Yeah, well, for one thing, there's just too many awful movies landing in the top five. You're not going to go see every animated kids thing. Yeah, and even if we just did 10 through 6, it would still be tough. Well, yeah, because those fall to the bottom five out of 10\n\nafter a few weeks. So, yeah, I'm going to try to step up my game on this show because people have been teasing me about, you know, it's called Doug Loves Movies and I haven't seen anything because I mostly just see stuff on a plane. So I have to wait for it to be on DVD or on a plane. That actually makes me feel better. Well, it's just that you don't see stuff makes me feel better because my mind goes to you when I think I should be seeing stuff. Oh, good. me feel better because you i always my mind goes to you what i think i should be seeing stuff oh good so we're all just uh it kind of proves makes me feel like everybody in any kind of broadcasting is a total liar and doesn't doesn't really know shit about the subject that they are\n\na supposed expert on because because doing a show about being an expert on something it takes more energy than being an expert well i think but But Ducky, if you had the time, you would be going to see movies. Oh, yeah. No, I had the time. It was called my 20s. I saw everything. It was ridiculous. And now it's just as soon as I, like, I was all fired up to see Columbiana.\n\nI was like, how could that miss? You know, Zoe Saldana running around killing dudes. Then I find out it's PG-13, so it's already like, okay. Right. This is already, that's's already like, okay. Right. This is already, that's a big strike against it. Yeah. And then the reviews come out and everybody hates it. So I'm just like, okay, I've totally lost my enthusiasm for it, but I really was looking\n\nforward to it. And now I might not ever see it. Maybe, well, they remake a lot of stuff. So you see, like, if you already saw Footloose, then that counts. You don't have to go see the new one. So did you see the original Straw Dogs? Is what colombiana was based on no just the update of straw dogs i did see the original straw dogs and i really don't have much compunction to see the uh i'm not compelled to see the new one and plus everyone hates it so then right and it's\n\ngetting bad reviews yeah so why do i have to bother? I saw a movie up in Toronto called Sleepless Night. In French, it's Nuit Blanche. Ooh. Or Veilleur Lesiac. So White Night in French? Sleepless Night. Yeah, I thought that to be the case. But the expression Nuit Blanche means that you had a sleepless night, apparently.\n\nLike the lights were on in the dark. I get it. That must have been confusing when that movie with Baryshnikov came out. In France. In Gregory Hines. Oh, that's it. Yeah, that one. Yeah.\n\nBut this one is about a dude who is a corrupt cop and there's a bad drug deal and his son ends up getting kidnapped. is a corrupt cop and there's a bad drug deal and his son ends up getting kidnapped. And that's why it's called Sleepless Night because it's really hard to sleep when you're trying to get back your son from a bad drug deal. That one night, it is tough. And it all takes place in one giant,\n\nyou know, obnoxious kind of nightclub. So there's constant scenes of people chasing each other through the nightclub and, you know, fighting their way through the crowd. and it's uh it's pretty really good music right well yeah there's a thumping music playing but it's uh it was a good movie i enjoyed it have you guys seen anything lately have you been to the movies i saw drive this weekend oh so i'm about to go see that right after i leave this because i'm doing the Adam Carolla podcast later tonight. And there's a, there's three people on that show,\n\nAdam and Allison and Brian, and they're at some sort of stalemate about drive. Like some of them love it and some of them hate it. So they want me to come in and be some sort of judge deciding vote, which doesn't really, doesn't mean anything, but I still, I still took the challenge. I've got to fit in a showing of drive in between my podcast and Adam's podcast. I loved it. I think it's a good use of your time.\n\nI like Ryan Gosling. I never saw Bronson, the other movie directed by the same dude. I always heard good things about that. I'm not familiar with him. I know he did a trilogy of violent movies, too. I forget what they're called. Nicholas Rain is his name? I guess so.\n\nNicholas Winding Rain is the director. He's Danish. I know that. Why does he have an Indian name? I don't know. Winding Rain. Winding Rain. R-E-Y-N. Oh, okay. Well, that stuff was good, Doug. I think you're going to enjoy it. All know. Winding Rain. Winding Rain. R-E-Y-N.\n\nOh, okay. But that stuff was good, Doug. I think you're gonna enjoy it. Alright. It's violent. Yeah, that's what I've heard. I've heard that. Who is that character that you're doing now? I don't know. It just dropped down. So that's where I'm at. Did you see it with people that talk like that?\n\nWere you surrounded by people like that at the cinema? I was in Burbank.bank yeah so that's what happened in burbank howard always you you drag your family into your uh into who charted from time to time to voice their opinions yes what is it like uh your father my brother your brother lee yes lee kramer i thought there was more than one is it Your father? My brother. Your brother? Lee. Yes. Lee Kramer. I thought there was more than one. Is it just the brother? Pretty much just the brother. And then if I start talking about my dad, I usually kind of just wind up talking like my brother and then kind of just bail out of it.\n\nAnd what is your brother, how does he feel about movies? Is he an avid moviegoer? has a couple of uh famous quotes among the family uh one is uh i'll only see two movies ferris bueller's day off and the in-laws that's it which in-laws i hope it's the first one it's the old one yeah serpentine child serpentine and yeah he hates the movies people drug jiggling their keys, eating popcorn. He doesn't like it. Oh, he has all those activities that happen around you at the movies. Yeah. He can't stand.\n\nNot good. And what was the other thing? You said there's two things he says? I thought I hit both of them, but I don't know. There's two movies that he will see. Oh, yeah. In-Laws and Ferris Bueller's Death. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nHis brother stopped liking things like 20 years ago. Right. Music. He hates music. Right. But now he likes kettlebells. What? What?\n\nExercising? Yeah. What? It's exercise equipment. I thought that was like a new band. I was like, ah, it's not. Sleigh bells. Yeah.\n\nWhat does he do? Kettlebells. Kettlebells. Does he like squats with the one kettlebell in between your legs, that sort of thing? I think that's what he does, yeah. Because they're not meant to be like one in each hand, are they? Yeah, I don't know. They're not really free weights.\n\nYeah, I don't know. Yeah, you probably could do something with two of them, but I don't know. Probably just need one. But yeah, he doesn't watch movies. The last movie I saw was Up in the Air. Really? Yeah, I saw it two weeks the Air. Really? You saw it late. On Netflix.\n\nTerrific movie, right? Yeah, I really did like it a lot. That was well done. People, like I remember some people were on the fence when it came out. It wasn't that good, but I really liked it. I think it defied expectations in a way that made people disappointed.\n\nBecause the trailer made it sound like it was sort of about one thing and then the movie itself is about something else well what did the trailer make it seem like the trailer made it seem more like it's just like uh almost like not a caper movie but just kind of like the the ins and outs of frequent travel oh okay you know because they really played up the part where he's at the TSA and he's telling her, don't go behind this person or that person. And he's all slick about travel. The stereotyping. Yeah, and they showed so many.\n\nAnd the trailer just made it look like it was going to be a slicker movie that was less heavy. Because it's pretty melancholy. I think they were afraid that people wouldn't see it if they knew it was kind of a bummer story about unemployment yeah just about people getting fired like but it's so but it's so it's it's also very funny though it is funny yeah that i iven reitman is really uh whoa hold on hold on his son his son his son uh which reitman is that uh i'm so funny we're all blanking wait i wanted to say reitman is that? I was going to say Catherine It's so funny we're all blanking out I thought it was Jake Hasden\n\nAm I wrong? No, it's a Reitman Orville Reitman Oh man Of the Reitman brothers Ivan, Catherine Billy Dan\n\nSchmitty Dan Wilbur Montague Ira Malachi Jason Jason Reitman there it is Jason Reitman\n\nso yeah Jason Reitman he's got quite a resume yeah but his movies have this real sense of style\n\nthat you know very few filmmakers especially young ones have you know like he's always...\n\nSo far, every movie, he's really grasped the... He's good with taking a screenplay and then putting it on the screen in an interesting way. So I can't wait to see what he's doing next. It didn't seem that depressing to me. I mean, it's just... Everybody's getting fired. Some people are getting fired.\n\nGood deal. Is that your review? Well, I mean, they need to get out of those jobs anyway. But it turns out to be. Look at the jobs they're getting fired from. But that's the thing. Did them a favor, right? Yeah.\n\nYeah. But instead of being sort of a satire on that, though, it turns out to be a lot about his just relationship with this one woman. Right. You know, unfortunately, that sort of thing is kind of cliched it's like i saw warrior the uh you know the mma movie oh yeah and it's really good but how many how how many times do i need to see the wife that doesn't want her husband to fight because it might he might get hurt like like that is such a given it should almost every movie should\n\nbe about a single fighter who doesn't have even a girlfriend to have that conversation with because we've heard it over and over and over again like yes it is the stakes are high you can get punched in the face and die but also how often does that happen is that evangeline lily no no she's that in something else right now oh okay oh is she different than uh the what what was with Marky, Mark and Christian Bill? The Fighter. That's the thing, The Fighter was like kind of a slicker version of Warrior,\n\nbut it's just bad timing in terms of the stories being kind of similar. Like it's, you know, it's two brothers that fight at the center of the story and they have issues with their other family members. But it's really that Tom Hardy guy is great. And I think, predict it right now, Nick Nolte is going to be in the supporting actor category.\n\nI think just because they love that sort of long, great career. Then he knocks one out of the park when he's older. How was the fighting? The fighting is really good. It's really, really brutal. Well, you know, I love UFC. I go see it live every chance I get. Well, I know that. I follow you on Twitter.\n\nI know you love movies. I know you like UFC. Yeah, I do. I love it. I'm going to go in Houston and San Jose. Really? I schedule stand-up shows the day after UFC fights, so I can just go to the fights and then the next day do my show. How much downtime is there between fights?\n\nNot much at all. Sometimes you have to wait around for 15, 20 minutes, but for the most part, it goes right into the next one. They schedule it really tightly, and when you're there, it's really fun because every fight sort of... They show them on TV too, but there's something about being there and then playing on the big screen, those kind of like little quick biographies of each of the fighters and you know previous fights they've been in and then when they come out to their song that\n\nthey chose it's such a such a great it's so much fun does anybody have a weird song yeah that doesn't fit they do they pick some weird stuff sometimes but that's a thing they do in warrior is one of the characters comes out to classical music each time. And the commentators are kind of like, oh, that's weird. And then another guy comes out to no music. Whoa, that's a statement. So bad. So do you know that the lead girl from Soderbergh's new movie from Haywire, I think is the name, the girl fighter.\n\nI think she's MMA. I'm so excited for that film. I've never seen a girl fight in MMA. I mean, I'm sure that exists, but I've never watched girls fight. It's always dudes on every card, you know, up and down the card. I don't know when that happens, but I would be into it.\n\nYeah, man. Oh, man, would I be into that. That'd be crazy, watching one lady choke another lady out. Yes. It happens. Oh, my God. It happens sometimes. Don't they have those?\n\nThey have ladies in those, don't they? Yeah, but just Doug hasn't seen it. Oh, you just haven't seen it live? UFC, I don't know if any ladies officially fight in the main, you know, in the... Who's the good-looking one? Like the Gina? Gina or something? The one that's dating Clooney?\n\nStacey Keebler? No, no. She's just a regular wrestler, right? Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a boxer. There was, like, a hot, like, hope solo of boxing, like, two years ago. Oh, not Layla Ali. Yeah, not Ali. She's hot.\n\nNo, she was... Hot boxer. Maybe she was MMA. That makes me laugh. One of your listeners will know. She has kind of an Italian-sounding name, but she's American, and she's pretty, and she would win all her fights all the time. I don't know, but I was a hot boxer in my car before I came up to the studio. I can tell you that much.\n\nSo, Howard, I've been on Who Charted, but this is your first appearance on Douglas Movies. Well, we came on right in the beginning, right when Who Charted started. Came on with Paul Scheer and Drew to promote Who Charted. Oh, and we all did that at the old... Yeah, Old Earwolf.\n\nOkay, so you have played the Leonard Maltin games. You are familiar. Yes. Okay. I came into this today played the Leonard Maltin games. You are familiar. Yes. Okay. I came into this today thinking you'd never been on before. But I also was kind of thinking, well, maybe they have, but I can only picture myself in your studio with you guys. Yeah.\n\nAnd that's because that's where we did it. Yeah, well, I'm so happy to be here. Yeah, yeah, and you've never been. Oh, wow, your first one. Yeah. There you go. Yeah, but I know you are aware of the Leonard Maltin game because you've been subjected to it many times.\n\nBecause you're at UCB quite a bit. I am. And I saw your shows in Seattle, which were great. Yeah, those were so much fun. So fun. And your hubby, Scott Aukerman. Is a maniac about it. Yeah.\n\nHe takes it real seriously. He really does not want to lose. I mean, he comes home and he has to talk about it. He has to talk about what happened. He has to break it down. Here's where it went wrong for me. Yes, this was the crowd's reaction. Then Sam Levine said this.\n\nOh, no. There's quite a rivalry there. I hope Scott has a chance of getting into the next Tournament of Champions and then eventually possibly going up against Sam in the Super Tournament of Champions. And I hope that that happens. Well, the triumvirate is Sam, Scott, and Paul of Tompkins, correct? Right, yeah. Paul and Scott lost to Sam.\n\nAnd in the previous Tournament of Championships, the ultimate winner was Matt Brawner over Ricky Lindholm and Jimmy Pardo. So now we've got Brawner and Sam Levine for the Super Championships, but now we need to get one more contender. Oh, man. And it's an amazing list, and I'll probably start after the new year. I'll start doing those. And if you guys want to try to qualify as an alternate,\n\nbecause we already have so many players, if you want to try to qualify, what you have to do is you have to get a name right in the Leonard Mullen game in negative names and go on to win the game that day outright. I don't know negative names. What's that one?\n\nYou have to give the names, right? It's tricky. When someone bids zero names, you can go even lower and say negative names, and then go even lower and say negative names, and then you have to name the cast from the top of the list going down. It's crazy. And Sean Cullen, one time, not being taped, but just in front of an audience because I play with the members of the audience at my shows,\n\nhe got Star Trek The Voyage Home in negative four names. What? Wow. Yeah, it was amazing. Wow. Yeah. Hey, if you want to double back the hot boxers or MMA chick is Gina Carano. Oh, there she is. MMA. Look at her.\n\nI was looking under boxing. I don't think there's lady fights in UFC, but there should be. If there isn't. Dang, she is hot. You know Dana White? Tell him to get on it. I do not know him, but I know a guy who knows him.\n\nMMA. I like this Gina. Wait, she might be the girl from Haywire. She probably is. She's an actress, too. Yeah. What's Haywire? It's Steven Soderbergh's next film.\n\nOh, that's it. Yeah, yeah. Okay. You don't know shit. I know. Can I swear on him? I know Sasha Gray. I know about that.\n\nShe's a porn star. But Soderbergh used her in his movie. Oh, I see. He takes hot chicks from various tough professions and puts them in movies. That's it. In those two examples. Exactly. The only examples.\n\nNo, he also did it with He'll do it with you Podcasting's tough He'll do it with you Who plays the virus in Contagion? Isn't that a model? Exactly, yeah It's a supermodel Hot virus\n\nPlays the virus Somebody from Brazil With a hot butt They play like some sort of 70s music And it dances around in between They use it to segue to the next scene. And then you see Gwyneth Paltrow's like crazy death face. Oh, God.\n\nI don't know if she's in Haywire, but she was in Ring Girls, a fast-paced story about five American women from Vegas who take on the ultimate challenge of fighting. Muay Thai. Oh. Muay Thai. I'd rather see a movie about Ring Girls. Me too. You know, the ones that hold the sign. A bunch of Asians coming Muay Thai. Oh. Muay Thai. I'd rather see a movie about ring girls. Me too. A bunch of Asians\n\ncoming from... Oh. The ones that hold the round sign. I thought you meant from The Ring. So I was picturing a bunch of Japanese girls with long hair covering their face, slowly moving towards you at the foot of your bed. No? I watched... No, but I watched a few minutes of Sarah Michelle Gellar's new\n\nshow and I'm not into it. Really i declare it dead on arrival is it hard away what is that what is it soap opry she plays sister twin sisters one of them one of them's named shabba shabban which is the most horrible name to write or say and i'm sorry anyone any shabban listeners out there but uh she plays shabban and then some other girl, and one was a stripper, but you never, you know, there's never any scenes of her in a stripper. I was going to say, did she work the pole or anything like that? No, you never see her work in the pole. At least I didn't in the parts I saw.\n\nBut anyway, I wish it would be better, because I think it would be cool if she had another good TV show. I saw, when I was in Canada, there was a Buffy marathon going on on, you know, much music. Because just like MTV, they don't really play videos. They just play recycled stuff.\n\nYeah, they don't have new shows either. I forgot about that channel. But at least it's a Buffy marathon. So I watched like three episodes. I was like, I used to love this so much. Okay, so you guys get to pick who you're going to play for in the Leonard Maltin game from people I selected on Twitter. I'm not going to say who they named as a shithead, but if you lose on their behalf, I will name a shithead for them.\n\nOkay. So Kulop will let you pick first. Would you like someone called at SadPants12? Yes. All right. Kulop is playing for at SadPants12. And that leaves you with a lot to choose from, Howard. Would you like magma underscore carta?\n\nHi, I'm Bill. Hi spelled H-I-G-H. Adam from Brisbane. Penis underscore slap. And my favorite of this batch, snork juice. That's pretty good. Yeah, or snougans 913. If I don't take Snork Juice, no one's playing for Snork Juice?\n\nThat's correct. Okay, I'll take Snork Juice. Oh, I could have played for Snork Juice. Oh, if you like Snork Juice, I'll take the last one. What was that one? Snorgle? Snugans 913. Yeah, I like Snugans.\n\nAll right. That Snugans is a Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes word. Yeah. Oh, okay. Wait, can i pull out of that your jersey brother well the thing is my my family lives in that town where the comic book store is and they're gonna have a reality show there which is where is it red bank and red bank yeah holy crap so i gotta get out of that all right so who do you want instead you want magma card a high yeah magma magma No offense to those guys.\n\nIt's just, you know. I understand. My hometown. It's a conflict. Sing the whole song. Sing the whole song. That's Bruce. Sing the whole song.\n\nNo, it's Doug's show. Come on, Kulap. Come on, Kulap. My hometown. Let's stick to Doug's wildly loose structure. Hey, by the way, guy ben sunko he he's a listener who said hey i think i can help you with the fact that it's always hard to remember which direction you go and he sent me this thing he like built a web page that's supposed to like how look it's like an arrow it shows but i don't really understand how to use it so thank you for sending this to me, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\n\nMaybe I'm an idiot. I think I've got it figured out. Somebody got real mad in Seattle. Somebody in the audience was like, no, let's go the other way. It's so confusing that I understand when people you know think it's going the wrong way but also i like to think my decisions are final but that if i say it's going one way that's the way it's going and you know it's not like yeah it's not like i would send it a certain direction to screw over a particular player because i have no i have no interest i'm gonna try using doing that i wanted to thank that guy but i also want to try using this all right\n\nwell it's gonna be hard because you got to flip back and forth between the Leonard Moulton game you loaded and that page. Right, that's okay. You need two phones to really pull it off. Would you like to use my phone as well? No, no, I can just, you know, app switch here. Alright, yeah. Tech talk. DLM.\n\nGo apeshit on the app switch. As long as we start, apparently we're starting this can we start that way it's your it's your ball go ahead and run with it you want to start with uh howard over there is that cool sure you ready for this all right okay here's the deal guys i got two categories but there's a number of films in each um one category is called dragon boy suede come on just howard's uh hip-hop alter ego. These are movies with the word dragon,\n\nthe word boy, or the word suede in the title. Okay, okay. And then the other one, in honor of who charted, this is called Number Ones. This is either movies that were number one at the box office for the year they came out, or the word one is in the title. Well, can we discuss it? Can Kulap and I discuss it?\n\nNo, no, we were playing against each other. You're opponents. Yeah, so if you wanted to find out what she likes or doesn't like and then try to screw her over, I guess you could do that. Yeah, I'll do that. I'm going to say you would probably want the Hoot Chartered one. I don't know. Maybe I want the Dragon Boy Suede.\n\nBecause I'll know that it's Dragonboy or Suede. I'll know that. Oh, there's more hints. I'll take Dragonboy Suede. She came to play. Dragonboy Suede. Here we go. Talked him into it.\n\nThank you. The year is 2000. The stars from Leonard, three. And there are nine names in this intelligent, low-key movie. Intelligent, low-key, what year? And what year and Leonard gives it three year 2000 okay freshly observed also is another freshly observed year 2000 yeah nine names how many names do you think you can get it in, starting from the bottom, going up? Six.\n\nSix. To cool up. Name that movie. Whoa! Wait a second. Unprecedented. I thought I was unprecedented with the six. How dare you? Jesus. So he gets all but one name? No, three.\n\nThree? Because nine names. Okay, so you get all but three names, and he's got all one name? No, three. Three? There's nine names. Nine names. Okay. So you get all but three names. And he's got all those clues. Okay. Yeah. Wow. There's some juicy names in this.\n\nYou're poised to win on this one. Here we go. Year 2000. Three stars. First name is Jane Adams. Oops. Oh, I forgot how to play. I realized what I did.\n\nOh, well. Good. Here we go. Jane Adams. Philip Bosco. did. Oh, well, good. Here we go. Jane Addams. Philip Bosco. Right. Rip Torn. Okay.\n\nRichard Thomas. Katie Holmes. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. And Robert Downey Jr. Who are B, D, J? There's three names above that. There's three names above that.\n\nThere's three names above that. This was in the lull of of robert downey jr okay so downey jr was probably like still doing a lot of stuff probably yeah and so he didn't have a big role this is smartly observed it's year 2000 oh man intelligent dragon boy or suede oh yeah i forgot about that right that's probably the key thing so um uh intelligent low-key and um i'm gonna say freshly observed if do i get penalized for guessing wrong yes you lose the point and i lose a point completely it's gonna get a point if i don't get this are you in yeah pressure's on all right i mean okay uh do you have any ideas? Well, I just... Dude.\n\nAll right. I'm going to say... I mean, this is just stupid. Year of the Dragon. That's incorrect. Do you know it, Doug? No, but let's... Who was the first name again?\n\nJane Addams. Oh, Jane Addams. Philip Bosco. Rip Torn. Richard Thomas. Katie Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. This one might be the giveaway, but maybe not.\n\nFrances McDormand? Oh, wait. And then there's two. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's going to be boy something. It's something with the boy. Yeah, I know it's not suede or dragon. What? It's something with the boy. Yeah, I know it's not suede or dragon. Toby McGuire.\n\nOh, boy. And then this should give it away. Michael Douglas. Oh, Wonder Boys. Oh, Wonder Boys. That's plural. I'm not dragging boys, Wade. Dragging boys, Wade. I always thought it was dragging boys, Wade. Boys's plural. I'm not dragging boys, Wade. Dragon boys, Wade.\n\nI always thought it was dragon boys, Wade. Boys, Wade. Boys within boys. I did for a while. I was thinking about dragons, boys, Wade. That's true. But I did. I don't want it.\n\nI would have liked that. All right. So that's point for cool up. And then without using your thing, I know that next goes to me. And then from me, it goes to Howard. Because he started last time and then she was next. It went this way. It has to go this way.\n\nIt went this way, so now it has to go that way. See what I'm saying? No, no, it went that way. It has to go that way. It has to go this way. They're just moving their fingers around, listeners, back and forth. You're moving your finger the same way both times. Draw it on the table.\n\nKarate Kid, wash in, wash out. So you're saying it's me and then cool off. So do you want another Dragon Boy Suede or number ones? Explain number ones again. It's the top grossing film of the year that it came out or it has one in the title. Wow, that is crazy crazy it is kind of crazy\n\nyeah and and also lazy because i couldn't think of a better category you know what i can i add in something it seems better idea to take the one because then you just know there might be one in the title where's the other one you're like is it suede i don't know should i be thinking about but there might not be one in the title because it's also could be the number one film of the yeah there's no there's no one in titanic as an example i bet you there isn't a single uh number one movie that has the word one and could have oh that would have been a good thing to look up but i didn't do that i put the one in winter's bone all right i'm gonna be one uh okay i'll take i'll take the one thing just okay just to try it here we go uh the year is 1988 there are seven names and um\n\ni'm looking for something um must it's a must see even though the story meanders and becomes predictable Must see Story meanders Maybe it was a must see because everyone saw it It was a number one movie Or maybe one was in the title I don't know if it was a number one\n\nmovie why did I say that 1988 though right 1988 I could have been maybe I'm trying to throw you in How many names the number one movie? Why did I say that? It's 1988, though, right? 1988. I could have been, maybe I'm trying to throw you off. How many names? Seven. Alright, I will 1988.\n\nI'll start at five names. Five names. See what Kulop does with that. There's how many names on there? Seven. It's five out of seven. I think I? Seven names. It's five out of seven. I think I can get it. It was five out of seven.\n\nI mean, do I continue on the path that I have started? You said five, right? 1988. Mm-hmm. I'm only going to not get the lead two actors. Yeah. But I was eight years old when it came out. Whoa.\n\nThat's a factor. That's a factor. I must. But I've seen older movies. Yeah, you have. 88. 88. Okay.\n\n88. Okay. You said, okay, I'll name it. You said five, right? Yes. I'll name it. You said five, right? Yes. I'll name it. You name that movie. Oh, boy.\n\nWhoa, whoa. This is strategy. I get the five names. Let's hear it. At its finest. I'll ask you for the clues again if I don't know it after the five names. Cool Up is looking to go up 2-0. She's going to win.\n\nOn just saying name that. Yeah, it's a good strategy. I think it's not going to work this time. Whoa! I'm number one, and Doug knows all movies. That's why I said five names, because I knew it would put her in the position of... Prime Benson.\n\nBonnie Hunt. Here we go. Here we go. Bonnie Hunt. Great. Michael D. Roberts. Jack Murdock. Jerry Mullen.\n\nAnd what I consider a good giveaway, Valeria Golino. Oh, it's Rain Man. Yeah. Wow. The number one movie of that year. Because there's no one in Rain Man. But. That's true.\n\nI lost that round. Yes. But was that a better strategy? Because I wouldn't have gotten that. That was a great strategy. If I had said four names, I wouldn't have gotten that if i just said four names i wouldn't have gotten it i don't think i might have pulled it from bonnie hunn because she's like uh you know she's the waitress when he drops all the toothpicks and she's impressed that he knows how many fell on the floor um but yeah that would have been the other names didn't\n\nmean much and i really needed valeria galeno because she was only in that and Big Top Peewee. So then that was it. It narrows it down pretty quickly. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Big Top Peewee wasn't the top grossing film. And she's been in some other films too.\n\nYeah. She had a good career. Plus I knew there were two names left. So that left the Rain Man and his brother. Yes. All right. We're back to Howard. Okay.\n\nDo you want another Dragon Ball Z? And then it comes to me? No, it's going to go to Gulab again, because now we're going back the other way. Spinning top. This thing is working that this guy made. Look, the arrow's like that, and so. Okay. Okay.\n\nOkay, so now I know. Do you want another number ones, or do you a another dragon boy swedish i'm gonna go for ones this time okay i'm sorry i don't have a third category that would have been nice no apologies this show is really thrown together even faster than most of them yeah um all right two stars right 10 names uh-huh the year is 2001 oh 2001 and this is a one a one note black comedy oh oh i can do this one black 2001 one note black comedy i can do some funny moments but mostly obvious i can do this am going to get this one in I don't know strategy on this game. If you think you know it, I'd say\n\nshoot for the stars, man. I don't know what that means, though. Does that mean zero? Does it mean negative one? I don't know. I'll go with Wait, okay. I'll go with four. Okay. Okay, four. So then, if he says I'll go with Wait Okay I'll go with Four Okay Four\n\nSo then If he says If I say what I'm going to say He's got to Name that's the Off of the The four back Right\n\nNot the bottom Four from the bottom The scrubs Name that movie Okay Here we go Yep Once again\n\nIt's 2001 Two stars it's a one no black comedy that was uh some funny moments but obvious okay here are your four names funny eric schaefer hold up schaefer yep go ahead leo rossi that's not a okay Okay. Of Martini and Rossi. Maybe. I don't know. I'll think about that. That might play out. The next two are good ones. Juicies.\n\nOkay. I call them Juicies. Andrew Dice Clay. Oh, okay. Oh, that's really juicy. And Richard Jenkins. Oh, Jenkins. Former Oscar nominee.\n\nOkay. This is 2000? The year is 2001. 2001. The category is 2001. 2001. The category is number ones. The review is one note. The stars are two. Do you know when you said black comedy,\n\nI assumed it was like a Tyler Perry movie. I wish that's what that meant. That would be... Has there ever been a black comedy that was also a black comedy? Who's putting dice clan something in 2001 fantastic question i'm i almost want to give you the name of the director because i don't think it's a giveaway am i allowed can i get the director no because i don't know if that might\n\ngive it away for somebody but it's all right i'm gonna guess this is the only place my brain is going the final season of Entourage. No. I think I know it. Is it a sequel? You can't do that, bro. I'm not going to tell you. I think it's a sequel. Is that your final answer?\n\nWell, I know I can't even think of the name of the movie that I'm thinking of. Dice Clay Jenkins. I mean... I can't think of what what that is i don't think i thought you had it i thought okay no i did think i had an idea but 2001 yeah it's more recent than what i'm thinking of i think mine too i was i will tell you that like this goes back to um this isn't really a hint i don't think but okay um probably when i first met you howard right around this time when i was going to to comedy shows a lot a lot of people were making jokes this was a punch line this movie oh this was a punch yeah people like to beat up on this title oh oh what i mean not because of the title necessarily but yeah sort of but also just\n\nbecause it was a bad movie oh son of a gun i think who's the director oh i'm not well well now i'm giving more clues wow dragon lady i i come on yeah okay no more all right this is what i'm gonna guess but i don't know if i'm getting the name right but the sequel to uh get shorty what was that it's not the incorrect answer but that was called the be cool that was that's be cool that's weird that you say that because that's totally wrong and yet sort of close oh it is yeah wait that's a hint for cool up disband no good she already got the point she wins the whole thing all right she wins it all but like give me give give me another name. You want more names?\n\nYeah. It's a weird-ass cast. Is Martin Short in this? No. Okay. If he is, he's uncredited. But when you said that, he might have been. Okay, okay.\n\nReba McIntyre. What? Michael Douglas. Oh, I know. Stop. I just said one more name is all I wanted. Oh, okay. Corky Romano.\n\nNo. Wow. But there's only two names left, right? No, no, there's a bunch of names left. There were ten names. Oh, I got this. I got Breckenmire's another name, right? No.\n\nI thought this was the... Oh, I know what it is. The Treasure Hunt movie. I know what it is. One Night at McCool's. That's right. Oh, and you said Be Cool. Be Cool, One Night at McCool's.\n\nThat's amazing. Oh, said Be Cool. Be Cool, One Night at the Ball. That's amazing. Oh, man. You were amazingly wrong. You know, when that movie came out, I felt pressure like that was some cool movie I was supposed to see, and I blew it off. I should have saw it. Because of the title?\n\nBecause Cool was in the title? I remember it was in magazines. Who's top build in that? Matt Dillon? Yeah, who is? Hold on. Maybe Charlize. I don't think that? Matt Dillon? Yeah, who is? Hold on. Maybe Charlize. I don't think it was Matt Dillon.\n\nI think it was... Charlize Theron? What's her name in that? In the Scream movies? Liv Tyler. Oh, Liv Tyler. It was Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser, Michael Douglas, Reba McIntyre. Weird, okay.\n\nJenkins, Dace, Rossi. Well, can I still... Michael Douglas that low in the cast was pretty much the giveaway, because it's either that or Ghosts of Girlfriends Pass. Well, can I still... Michael Douglas that low in the cast was pretty much the giveaway because it's either that or Ghost of Girlfriends Pass. Oh, jeez. I wouldn't have been able to pull either of those movies. He doesn't play a small supporting role very often.\n\nDo I lose? Am I totally out of it now? It's over. Yeah, it's all done. I won, bro. Good job. I won last time. We could play for fun if he goes on. We should maybe have some sort of fanfare that gets played when somebody wins. That's a good call. The winner is always kind of like people just keep talking about, so now what happens?\n\nOh, well, it's over. That's what happens. Let's see what I have. You won, Howard. You lost. Congratulations. Oh, thanks. I got to figure out who the shitheads are going to be.\n\nDon't let it carry over into our workplace. Here, I'll cook you up a triumphant theme right now. Okay, go. You just won the movie game. Leonard Bolton is ashamed of the loser. He got robbed. It almost worked out. You won. There you go.\n\nThat's great. If you guys could go into the studio and record that for me, I will totally play that every time the game is over. We'll do that. We'll do that right now. Right after this, we'll do it. I like the happy little voice at the end that you did there. You won!\n\nSo, Kulav was playing for Sandpants12. So, Sandpants12 doesn't get to name... or Sadpants. Oh, yeah. Hold on. i didn't even recognize that i was getting really upset like you misrepresented no sorry you were playing for salad pants 12 no no i would have never sad pants sad pants 12 and uh so i will i will be in touch with sand pants 12 sad pants 12 to um work out some sort of prize, I'll send you something.\n\nAnd then Howard was playing for MagmaCarta, so that person's shithead will get named. And then I was playing for SnorkJuice. SnorkJuice. What does that mean in the Kevin Smith world? SnorkJuice. No, it's snoogins. Oh, snoogins.\n\nOh, snoogins is just what he says. It's just a word that Jason Hughes yells out. Jersey slang. It's hard to write that down. Write down snoochie boochies also. What is the difference between the boochies and the snoochies? I don't know. I think there's just different conjugations, just different situations where one is appropriate.\n\nYou're going to have to go down the hall to the Kevin Smith podcast if you want to get the answer to these questions. If you could see Howard's doodles on a piece of paper and a mini whiteboard, you would think he was insane. Well, it looks like a Glenn Beck board. Are those three boobs? Yeah, triple boobs. Those started out of his face.\n\nHe was probably thinking that the answer was Total Recall. Yes. You guys, i had a great time in uh colorado i was just there in boulder at the boulder theater and at black sheep in colorado springs and i had such a great time that i will be back at comedy works in denver on november 2nd so get your tickets to that and this is gonna be a lot of fun i'm doing some stand-up shows the weekend of Halloween. I'm going to be at the Neptune Theater in Seattle on October 28th, the Punchline in San Francisco\n\non the 29th, and the Punchline in Sacramento on the 30th. Those Punchline shows are at 420 each day. What I'm suggesting, I love when people bring name tags to my shows because we always play the Len Malton game now. But this time I want people to, if you're into it, don't do this if you're not into it.\n\nDon't make me twist your arm. But dress up as your favorite movie character or as a movie character that shares a name with you. That's great. And that will be your name tag. And then you're more likely to get possibly selected by Graham to win some prizes. And would they stand up behind the player? No, they get up on stage and play one-on-one heads up against Graham Elwood or whoever I'm with on the road at the time. In this case, it's going to be Graham.\n\nAnd then also, speaking of Graham Elwood, you can go to ComedyFilmNerds.com to get autographed copies of my latest CD, Potty Mouth.

Not really. I think just the fans of your podcast will fill that place. Yeah, I'm really excited. I don't think you need to say who it is. I think we can spring it on them. Or should we just say it? Keep it a secret?\n\nI'm saying it's fun to keep it a secret. All right. I'll ask you after. Okay. Well, we could say that at a different time. Unless you think it's going to help move tickets, then go ahead and unload. Sir Mix-a-lot. Wow.\n\nYeah. Sir Mix. Sir Mix. I'm excited. But now, seriously, who are you going to have? Big butts?

I bet you he's really opinionated, too. I bet you're going to get... He's going to fight you guys. He didn't lie about the butts thing. Yeah, yeah. So we expect that same truth. Right.\n\nOh, and speaking of Sasquatch, we'll be at Sasquatch. No one brought up Sasquatch. Sasquatch is right here. He's pointing to Belknap right now. Nobody even knows what that means anymore.

So much fun. Ridiculous. It was like, I don't know. I mean, that's one of, like, the top podcast-listening cities, right? Because they were so cool and you could get it. Yeah, it's a good one. But, you know, all cities are podcast-listening cities.\n\nThat's true. Anywhere where somebody's got some time on their hands to drive or work or whatever, where they can be listening to something, people are into it. And I certainly appreciate that. Oh, it's great. Oh, it's great. I love it. Oh, I love coffee.\n\nYou've got a great voice for podcasting. People do. They love my voice. You keep telling me that. They really fall in love with it. Well, I don't know. I don't go on those message boards. Maybe they're complaining about my voice on there.\n\nYou haven't told me. No, everyone loves you, Wee Wee. Great. Do you read all that stuff? On Earwolf 1, I do. That's probably a little nicer. That's a little nicer, yeah. Yeah, some of those other ones they can get pretty pretty brutal hardcore because you can sign up under any name you know it's like how how insulted should you be by someone whose handle\n\nis something like i'm an asshole right and yet and yet yeah yeah you even you warned me and i still am hurt by what you had to say. You gave me a complete heads up that you're an asshole. I thought, oh, but maybe an asshole's got a good point. Maybe this asshole has something to say to me where I'll learn about myself. In the back of your head, you're like, if an asshole likes me, it means even more. Maybe it's going to be positive. Oh, shoot. It wasn't.\n\nYes, I am worthless, like my mom said. Oh, that was sad. She didn't say it like that. She has an Asian accent. I'd like to thank everybody for being here. Kulap, last name withheld. Fair. The name that shall not be mentioned.\n\nVoldemort.
