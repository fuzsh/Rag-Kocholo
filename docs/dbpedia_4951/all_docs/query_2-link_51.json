        "text": "Saying you’re a friend of Jan Humphrey won’t get you into the building, nor will it get you a free drink.\n\n“Humphrey” of Humphrey’s Restaurant and Bar is actually the nickname of current owner Jan Manglesdorf’s late husband Bob, who opened the bar in 1976.\n\nTwo stories surround how Bob Manglesdorf, a 1967 Saint Louis University graduate and 1969 SLU masters in business administration graduate, got his nickname, which would later become the name of one of the most well-known bars in the city. His wife tells that her husband claimed the nickname came from his grade school days at Mt. Carmel Grade School. However, friends of Bob Manglesdorf tell that he got the nickname during his Phi Kappa Theta pledge period, in which he wrestled a bear named Humphrey.\n\nThe origins of the bar date back to the early 1970s. In 1971, John Clark, at age 21, opened the first area bar on the corner of Spring and Laclede called Friday’s. Over the next few years, the area around campus became one of the first bar areas in the city, said Jan Manglesdorf. Caleco’s, Free Advice Bar, Pastori’s, The Loading Zone and eventually Humphrey’s opened within the first half of the ’70s.\n\nIn 1973, Bob “Humphrey” Manglesdorf, a friend of John Clark’s, took the job of organizing the bar’s business affairs. By 1975, Bob Manglesdorf decided to go into business for himself and opened Humphrey’s in June 1996.\n\nThe building that Humphrey’s now resides in is actually five buildings, all former row houses or businesses built in the early 1900s.\n\nJan Manglesdorf worked as a dental hygenist and bartender by night, eventually devoting herself to the bar completely in 1980.\n\nIn 1986, Bob “Humphrey” Manglesdorf died.\n\nJan Mangelsdorf boasts of two traditions that exist from the opening of Humphrey’s-the plunger and Penny Pitchers.\n\nThe plunger was a tradition begun by Bob Manglesdorf when he served bar. According to his wife, the bar would get very busy, and inevitably, someone would ask for a birthday drink. In frustration, Bob would reach for the plunger-used to unclog the perpetually clogging sink-and fill it with several shots of tequila or vodka. For many years, the same plunger was used, despite its more practical uses.\n\nToday, Humphrey’s goes through more than 5,000 plunges every year. However, the actual drink mixture has been more fruiter and novelty plungers are used.\n\nJan Manglesdorf said that she gets grandma’s, professors, secretaries and numerous students that come in to celebrate their birthday with a plunger. Sometimes the plunger is even filled with tea or punch, in lieu of alcohol.\n\nAnother tradition, Penny Pitchers continues every Wednesday night at 11 p.m. Patrons can get their pitcher refilled for just a penny, though Jan suggests tipping the bartender. This tradition began during the bars opening night.\n\nJan Manglesdorf says the University tends to frown on these traditions, but she says that she will not relent. “You have to have some traditions,” she said. She also noted that her staff works to control these traditions and make sure everyone acts responsibly.\n\nRecently, Humphrey’s received national attention as it hosted the opening of the movie “One Night at McCool’s,” written by Stan Seidel, a friend of the Manglesdorfs’ who died in 2000 from Crohn’s Disease. The opening raised money for a fund setup to honor medical professionals who care for those with the disease.\n\nThe movie is based on one of the first bartenders Randy Dana, who was best friends of Seidel. Near the opening of the movie, a plunger is used to celebrate a student’s birthday. In addition, Jan Manglesdorf believes the eclectic nature of Seidel’s ficticious bar, reflected the eclectic nature of Humphrey’s, where both suits and workman’s boots eat and drink together.\n\nJan Manglesdorf jokes that friends of Seidel’s continue to argue over which character in the movie was represented by whom.\n\nThe one regret she has about her business is that too few people know that Humphrey’s also serves a full menu. She bragged that her patty melts draw people from all over the city, and even encourage people to have plane layovers in St. Louis just for a bite.\n\n“Most people just don’t realize that I have great food,” she said.\n\nStudents are quick to point out the dichotomy of a relaxing atmosphere on many nights, but a hectic, energetic crowd during Penny Pitchers."
