        "text": "Â USA Films Matt Dillon and Liv\n\nTyler star in Harald Zwart’s \"One Night at McCool’s.\"\n\n“One Night at McCool’s”\n\nStarring Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser\n\nand Michael Douglas Directed by Harald Zwart\n\nEve has once again wrongly tempted man, but this time\n\nshe’s five-foot-ten, blue-eyed, pouty-lipped, and her\n\nbrassiere is showing. Among the recent portrayal of powerful women\n\nin such movies as “Erin Brockovich” and\n\n“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” “One Night at\n\nMcCool’s” reveals a different kind of strength women\n\npossess ““ their power to manipulate men by using only their\n\nsexuality and beauty. Liv Tyler ingeniously plays the role of\n\nJewel, a temptress who offers her body instead of an innocent\n\napple. She is perfectly sensual with her seductive smile and\n\nflawless image, making her a knockout. She is the secret weapon in\n\nthis film, the first to come from Academy Award-winning producer\n\nand actor Michael Douglas and his new production company, Further\n\nFilms. Along with co-producing, Douglas also plays a small role as\n\nhit man Mr. Burmeister. The film is about three unsuspecting men\n\nwho lust after a woman whose only desire is to have a house of her\n\nown. It all started one night at McCool’s with the\n\nbar’s owner, Randy (Matt Dillon); Randy’s uncle Carl\n\n(Paul Reiser), who is also a lawyer; and a detective, Dehling (John\n\nGoodman). They get involved with each other after a crime is\n\ncommitted at the bar and end up getting manipulated by the same\n\nwoman, Jewel. She has the ability to take Randy’s house away\n\nfrom him, make Carl forget about his wife, and Dehling forget about\n\nthe memory of his wife. She refuses to let anyone or anything come\n\nin between her and her home-decorating dream, especially not her\n\nconscience, since a few dead bodies do come up. Although it is a\n\ntypical story of men all fighting for the same woman, an\n\ninteresting twist comes from the radically different perspectives\n\nof Randy, Carl and Dehling, as each man creates his own version of\n\nthe story according to the way Jewel has manipulated him. Along\n\nwith the three different versions comes three different images of\n\nJewel, three different personalities and even different styles of\n\nthe same dress, so that the real Jewel is never portrayed. In his\n\nfeature film directorial debut, Harald Zwart has fun portraying\n\nJewel in so many contrasting ways and uses the camera inventively\n\nin order to create the desired images. Not only does Zwart make Liv\n\nTyler shine on screen, but he also allows the other actors to be so\n\nconvincing that the audience has no choice but to feel outright\n\npity for how they are so easily played. The screenplay by Stan\n\nSeidel is well-written, the plot is humorous and the characters are\n\namusingly very human. It is also a clever idea to have a woman,\n\nJewel, capable of more sex and violence than all the men combined\n\ncan handle. The abundance of sex and violence, however, is highly\n\nunnecessary, and the film would be all the more charming if some of\n\nits current content were removed, appealing to a larger audience.\n\nThe film will entertain and evoke laughter, but more should be\n\nexpected of a Michael Douglas production. So disregard the big name\n\nbefore going to see this one.\n\nSophia Whang Rating: 7\n\n“The Golden Bowl”\n\nStarring Nick Nolte, Uma Thurman and Jeremy Northam\n\nDirected by James Ivory\n\nBased on Henry James’ novel, “The Golden Bowl”\n\ntells the tale of the twisted love affair between Prince Amerigo\n\n(Jeremy Northam) and his poor American lover Charlotte Stant (Uma\n\nThurman). Amerigo is a poor Italian aristocrat engaged to Maggie\n\nVerver (Kate Beckinsale), the daughter of American billionaire and\n\nart collector Adam Verver (Nick Nolte). Amerigo ultimately severs\n\nhis love affair with Charlotte. Charlotte, the daring and\n\nrelentless protagonist and old school friend to Maggie, joins the\n\ntwo in London shortly before the wedding. She manages to win the\n\nexclusive company of Amerigo in her search for a wedding present,\n\nwhen they discover what appears to be a flawless golden bowl.\n\nHowever, she does not purchase it. Thereafter, the plot thickens as\n\nCharlotte marries Adam Verver, and the peaceful marriages of the\n\ncouples become only a mirage belying the surreptitious and\n\nbetraying love affair between Amerigo and Charlotte. The quiet\n\nreunion of the two is in part due to the exclusive father-daughter\n\nrelationship between Adam and Charlotte. The audience watches a\n\nlonely Amerigo give in to the passions inflamed by Charlotte while\n\nseeing little of the naive and innocent Maggie, who devotes much of\n\nher time and care to her father. Maggie is but a shadow until the\n\ngolden bowl provides an avenue of truth to her. She then becomes a\n\ndynamic character whose once pale and fair complexion finally\n\nbecomes animated and flushed with powerful emotions. Immediately,\n\nthe audience falls in love with the strong and forgiving heroine,\n\nas does Prince Amerigo. All the while, Charlotte sinks more and\n\nmore into a frenzy for fear of exposure and chokes in despair as\n\nAmerigo professes and declares his love for Maggie. Bound by her\n\nmarriage to Adam, Charlotte loses the independence she once\n\nrepresented with her bold, passionate adulterous advances and\n\nleaves for America with her husband. The cluttered and symbolic\n\nmise-en-scene and the choppy jumps from scene to scene work well\n\ntogether to allude to a sort of thrilling and chaotic plot.\n\nHowever, despite the performances given by the actors, especially\n\nThurman as the frantic Maggie, the plot itself is not very\n\nintriguing. What seemed to be a rather good build-up of a complex\n\nplot stagnates at the point of the golden bowl’s rediscovery.\n\nThe highly unlikely connection made through the golden bowl that\n\nultimately leads to the discovery of Stant and Amerigo’s love\n\naffair is a weak culmination, rendering the turning point of the\n\nfilm disappointing.\n\nJinjue Pak Rating: 6\n\n“Freddy Got Fingered”\n\nStarring Tom Green and Rip Torn\n\nDirected by Tom Green\n\nTom Green is weird. Viewers who watch his crazy shenanigans on\n\n“The Tom Green Show” and his brief appearances in\n\nvarious movies will agree. His latest film, “Freddy Got\n\nFingered,” is so incredibly strange that it seems as if this\n\nCanadian hooligan will not stop until audiences have no doubt that\n\nhe is a crazy, crazy man. Directed and co-written by Green,\n\n“Freddy Got Fingered” tells a story about Gord (Green),\n\na 28-year-old man who lives with his parents and dreams of one day\n\ncreating a television show from his wild cartoon drawings.\n\nGord’s father (Rip Torn) cannot handle seeing his slacker son\n\nstill living at home and insists that he find himself a real job\n\nand move out. Gord will not budge. A wild family dispute erupts\n\nthat results in many wild antics committed by both father and son.\n\nEach of these absurd antics, however, is so random that the movie\n\nseems like a gruesome group of haphazardly-placed sketches thrown\n\ntogether without any real kind of relation to each other ““ a\n\nformat similar to that of “The Tom Green Show.” One\n\ndisturbing scene consists of Gord licking the exposed bone of his\n\ninjured friend. A few scenes later, Gord aids a pregnant woman in\n\ngiving birth and then bites off the baby’s umbilical cord as\n\nblood sprays everywhere. He then proclaims loudly to have saved the\n\nday as he is escorted out of the hospital. Nonetheless, this is\n\nwhat viewers have come to expect from Green. Wild on-screen antics\n\nthat are both insane and unusual are the foundation of his career.\n\nHis craziness was central to his television show’s success.\n\nViewers were captivated by this young man who paraded around on\n\nstreets wreaking havoc with megaphones, microphones, fecal matter\n\nor any combination of the three. What made the show so intriguing\n\nwas the fact that it was real. Viewers watched real people’s\n\nreactions to this crazed lunatic and his nutty shenanigans.\n\nEverything seemed spontaneous and fun. On the big screen, though,\n\nthese antics just aren’t the same. When Gord licks his\n\nfriend’s wound, viewers know the hideous gash is just fancy\n\nmakeup work. When Gord makes a mess of the cheese factory, viewers\n\nknow the cheese factory is a mere movie set and those reacting to\n\nthis havoc are just acting. Unscripted, random and real-life\n\nweirdness can be funny, but scripted weirdness is just plain weird.\n\n“Freddy Got Fingered,” however, is beyond weird. Though\n\noccasionally funny, it is disgusting, stupid, demented and painful\n\nto watch."
