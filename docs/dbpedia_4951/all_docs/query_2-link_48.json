Rated R (language, strong sexuality). 3.5\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? , with George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, at the Palace 12 and Starworld 20. Those zany Coen Brothers (\"Raising Arizona,\" \"Fargo\") have gone and made the movie whose title was the punchline for a \"socially conscious\" film in the classic \"Sullivan's Travels.\" Then they mixed in mythical elements of Homer's \"Odyssey\" and came up with a Depression-era musical about three escapees from a Mississippi chain gang on a quest to find a hidden cache of loot.
