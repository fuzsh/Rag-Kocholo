        "text": "Continuity mistake: When Matt Dillon is talking to Michael Douglas at the bingo hall, the caller calls out \"O 18\". Later in the film during a different game, it's called again. All Bingo junkies know that the \"O\" numbers are 61 through 75.\n\nContinuity mistake: When Carl watches Matt Dillon \"rescue\" Liv Tyler from the car, we see Dillon chase the car while Liv Tyler takes off the top of her dress. Two shots later, she is taking it off again.\n\nContinuity mistake: When Matt Dillon first meets Liv Tyler, after he says, \"And there she was,\" when she turns her dress is off her left shoulder, but in the next close-up her dress is properly on her shoulder, then in the next shot it's down again.
