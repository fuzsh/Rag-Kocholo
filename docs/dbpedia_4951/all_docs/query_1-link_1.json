Detective Dehling (John Goodman) got there once McCool's became a crime scene. Was it the dead body that tied these men together? Not as tightly as the live wire who was also there that night: the stunning young woman aptly named Jewel (Liv Tyler). A steamy story told from three very different points of view that ultimately become one.",
