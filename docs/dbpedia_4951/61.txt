“One Night at McCool’s”

Starring Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser

and Michael Douglas Directed by Harald Zwart

Eve has once again wrongly tempted man, but this time

she’s five-foot-ten, blue-eyed, pouty-lipped, and her

brassiere is showing. Among the recent portrayal of powerful women

in such movies as “Erin Brockovich” and

“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” “One Night at

McCool’s” reveals a different kind of strength women

possess ““ their power to manipulate men by using only their

sexuality and beauty. Liv Tyler ingeniously plays the role of

Jewel, a temptress who offers her body instead of an innocent

apple. She is perfectly sensual with her seductive smile and

flawless image, making her a knockout. She is the secret weapon in

this film, the first to come from Academy Award-winning producer

and actor Michael Douglas and his new production company, Further

Films. Along with co-producing, Douglas also plays a small role as

hit man Mr. Burmeister. The film is about three unsuspecting men

who lust after a woman whose only desire is to have a house of her

own. It all started one night at McCool’s with the

bar’s owner, Randy (Matt Dillon); Randy’s uncle Carl

(Paul Reiser), who is also a lawyer; and a detective, Dehling (John

Goodman). They get involved with each other after a crime is

committed at the bar and end up getting manipulated by the same

woman, Jewel. She has the ability to take Randy’s house away

from him, make Carl forget about his wife, and Dehling forget about

the memory of his wife. She refuses to let anyone or anything come

in between her and her home-decorating dream, especially not her

conscience, since a few dead bodies do come up. Although it is a

typical story of men all fighting for the same woman, an

interesting twist comes from the radically different perspectives

of Randy, Carl and Dehling, as each man creates his own version of

the story according to the way Jewel has manipulated him. Along

with the three different versions comes three different images of

Jewel, three different personalities and even different styles of

the same dress, so that the real Jewel is never portrayed. In his

feature film directorial debut, Harald Zwart has fun portraying

Jewel in so many contrasting ways and uses the camera inventively

in order to create the desired images. Not only does Zwart make Liv

Tyler shine on screen, but he also allows the other actors to be so

convincing that the audience has no choice but to feel outright

pity for how they are so easily played. The screenplay by Stan

Seidel is well-written, the plot is humorous and the characters are

amusingly very human. It is also a clever idea to have a woman,

Jewel, capable of more sex and violence than all the men combined

can handle. The abundance of sex and violence, however, is highly

unnecessary, and the film would be all the more charming if some of

its current content were removed, appealing to a larger audience.

The film will entertain and evoke laughter, but more should be

expected of a Michael Douglas production. So disregard the big name

before going to see this one.

“The Golden Bowl”

Starring Nick Nolte, Uma Thurman and Jeremy Northam

Directed by James Ivory

Based on Henry James’ novel, “The Golden Bowl”

tells the tale of the twisted love affair between Prince Amerigo

(Jeremy Northam) and his poor American lover Charlotte Stant (Uma

Thurman). Amerigo is a poor Italian aristocrat engaged to Maggie

Verver (Kate Beckinsale), the daughter of American billionaire and

art collector Adam Verver (Nick Nolte). Amerigo ultimately severs

his love affair with Charlotte. Charlotte, the daring and

relentless protagonist and old school friend to Maggie, joins the

two in London shortly before the wedding. She manages to win the

exclusive company of Amerigo in her search for a wedding present,

when they discover what appears to be a flawless golden bowl.

However, she does not purchase it. Thereafter, the plot thickens as

Charlotte marries Adam Verver, and the peaceful marriages of the

couples become only a mirage belying the surreptitious and

betraying love affair between Amerigo and Charlotte. The quiet

reunion of the two is in part due to the exclusive father-daughter

relationship between Adam and Charlotte. The audience watches a

lonely Amerigo give in to the passions inflamed by Charlotte while

seeing little of the naive and innocent Maggie, who devotes much of

her time and care to her father. Maggie is but a shadow until the

golden bowl provides an avenue of truth to her. She then becomes a

dynamic character whose once pale and fair complexion finally

becomes animated and flushed with powerful emotions. Immediately,

the audience falls in love with the strong and forgiving heroine,

as does Prince Amerigo. All the while, Charlotte sinks more and

more into a frenzy for fear of exposure and chokes in despair as

Amerigo professes and declares his love for Maggie. Bound by her

marriage to Adam, Charlotte loses the independence she once

represented with her bold, passionate adulterous advances and

leaves for America with her husband. The cluttered and symbolic

mise-en-scene and the choppy jumps from scene to scene work well

together to allude to a sort of thrilling and chaotic plot.

However, despite the performances given by the actors, especially

Thurman as the frantic Maggie, the plot itself is not very

intriguing. What seemed to be a rather good build-up of a complex

plot stagnates at the point of the golden bowl’s rediscovery.

The highly unlikely connection made through the golden bowl that

ultimately leads to the discovery of Stant and Amerigo’s love

affair is a weak culmination, rendering the turning point of the

film disappointing.

“Freddy Got Fingered”

Starring Tom Green and Rip Torn

Directed by Tom Green

Tom Green is weird. Viewers who watch his crazy shenanigans on

“The Tom Green Show” and his brief appearances in

various movies will agree. His latest film, “Freddy Got

Fingered,” is so incredibly strange that it seems as if this

Canadian hooligan will not stop until audiences have no doubt that

he is a crazy, crazy man. Directed and co-written by Green,

“Freddy Got Fingered” tells a story about Gord (Green),

a 28-year-old man who lives with his parents and dreams of one day

creating a television show from his wild cartoon drawings.

Gord’s father (Rip Torn) cannot handle seeing his slacker son

still living at home and insists that he find himself a real job

and move out. Gord will not budge. A wild family dispute erupts

that results in many wild antics committed by both father and son.

Each of these absurd antics, however, is so random that the movie

seems like a gruesome group of haphazardly-placed sketches thrown

together without any real kind of relation to each other ““ a

format similar to that of “The Tom Green Show.” One

disturbing scene consists of Gord licking the exposed bone of his

injured friend. A few scenes later, Gord aids a pregnant woman in

giving birth and then bites off the baby’s umbilical cord as

blood sprays everywhere. He then proclaims loudly to have saved the

day as he is escorted out of the hospital. Nonetheless, this is

what viewers have come to expect from Green. Wild on-screen antics

that are both insane and unusual are the foundation of his career.

His craziness was central to his television show’s success.

Viewers were captivated by this young man who paraded around on

streets wreaking havoc with megaphones, microphones, fecal matter

or any combination of the three. What made the show so intriguing

was the fact that it was real. Viewers watched real people’s

reactions to this crazed lunatic and his nutty shenanigans.

Everything seemed spontaneous and fun. On the big screen, though,

these antics just aren’t the same. When Gord licks his

friend’s wound, viewers know the hideous gash is just fancy

makeup work. When Gord makes a mess of the cheese factory, viewers

know the cheese factory is a mere movie set and those reacting to

this havoc are just acting. Unscripted, random and real-life

weirdness can be funny, but scripted weirdness is just plain weird.

“Freddy Got Fingered,” however, is beyond weird. Though

occasionally funny, it is disgusting, stupid, demented and painful

to watch.
