Countess of Anjou

Queen consort of France (1098-1102)

Bertrade de Montfort was born circa 1059 in Montfort, Normandy, France to Simon I de Montfort (c1030-1087) and Agnes d'Évreux (c1040-) and died 14 February 1117 Fontevraud, France of unspecified causes. She married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou (1043-1109) 1086 JL . She married Philip I of France (1052-1108) 15 May 1092 JL .

Bertrade de Montfort (c. 1070 – 14 February 1117) was Queen of France by her marriage to Philip I of France. Initially married to Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, she left him and married Philip. Later she founded a daughter house of Fontevraud Abbey at Haute-Bruyeres.

Life

She was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes of Evreux. Her brother was Amaury de Montfort.

In 1089, Bertrade and Fulk, Count of Anjou were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk. In 1092 she left her husband to live with King Philip I of France. Philip married her on 15 May 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade.

According to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philip, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis, first through the arts of sorcery and then by poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philip in 1108. Bertrade took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey following Philip's death, but moved to a daughter house, which she founded, at Hautes-Bruyeres by 1112. She died in 1117.

Marriages and issue

1st Marriage: Fulk IV, Count of Anjou

Bertrade and Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, had:

Fulk of Jerusalem, Count of Anjou and King of Jerusalem (1089/1092–1143)

2nd Marriage: Philip I, King of France

He repudiated Bertha (claiming she was too fat) and married Bertrade on 15 May 1092. In 1094 following the synod of Autun, he was excommunicated by the papal representative, Hugh of Die, for the first time; after a long silence, Pope Urban II repeated the excommunication at the Council of Clermont in November 1095. Several times the ban was lifted as Philip promised to part with Bertrade, but he always returned to her; in 1104 Philip made a public penance and must have kept his involvement with Bertrade discreet. In France, the king was opposed by Bishop Ivo of Chartres, a famous jurist.

Philip's children with Bertrade were:

Philip, Count of Mantes (1093 – fl. 1123), married Elizabeth, daughter of Guy III of Montlhéry

Fleury Capet (1093-1119). Seigneur of Nangis

Cecile Capet (?-1145), married Tancred, Prince of Galilee and then, after his death, to Pons of Tripoli.
