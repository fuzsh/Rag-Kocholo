        "text": "In the spring of 1087, William the Conqueror, provoked by a supposed insult from King Philip I of France, marched on Paris, and sacked the frontier town of Mantes. Whilst at Mantes, however, he sustained severe injuries, and later died of his wounds, ending the campaign.\n\nWhat if the Normans are able to press on under his leadership and sack Paris?\n\nI sort of doubt that I just don't see William having the resources necessary to hold both. Likely he receives a ransom for returning Paris and Normandy is officially separated from France with maybe some minor territorial adjustments that would be my guess.\n\nThen we would have a united France and England from the late 1000's on.\n\nNope. At worst it's just a blow for the Capetian dynasty. If anything the French crown isn't the attractive prize it was in the Late Middle Ages, given how many of the vassals of the French king were more powerful than Philip I himself (including the aforementioned Guillaume).\n\nI sort of doubt that I just don't see William having the resources necessary to hold both. Likely he receives a ransom for returning Paris and Normandy is officially separated from France with maybe some minor territorial adjustments that would be my guess.\n\nThis would be more-or-less likely. THe problem is that, perhaps, Normandy might expand just enough to be able to secure some natural boundaries, as it doesn't have many of those."
