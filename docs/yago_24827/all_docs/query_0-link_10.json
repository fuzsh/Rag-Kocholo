        "text": "Life\n\nShe was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes of Evreux. Her brother was Amaury de Montfort.\n\nIn 1089, Bertrade and Fulk, Count of Anjou were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk. In 1092 she left her husband to live with King Philip I of France. Philip married her on 15 May 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade."
