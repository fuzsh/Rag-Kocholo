        "text": "Bertrade was born in 1155 in Chester, England. Bertrade's father was Simon II Le Chauve De Montfort and her mother was Maud Countess Of Evreux . Her paternal grandparents were Amaury De Montfort and Agnes De Garlende. She had two brothers named Amauri and Simon. She was the youngest of the three children.\n\nCountess of Chester\n\nLady of Campden\n\nShe was married to Earl Hugh de Keveliock V (son of Ranulf de Guernan and Maud de Caen) in 1169. Earl Hugh de Keveliock V was born in 1147 in Kevelioc, Monmouth, England. He died on 30 Jun 1181 in Leeke, Stafford, England. Hugh II, 5th Earl of Chester, surnamed Keveliock or Cyveliok, because he was born 1147 at Kevelioc, Co. Merioneth, Wales. He succeeded his father in the Earldom of Chester. This nobleman joined in the rebellion with Robert, Earl of Leicester, and the King of Scots against King Henry II, and in support of that monarch's son, Prince Henry's pretentions to the crown. In which proceeding he was taken prisoner with the Earl of Leicester at Almwick, but obtained his freedom soon afterwards, upon the reconciliation of the king with the young prince. During troublesome times following his lands were taken from him, but they were restored when public tranquility was restored. He died at Leeks, Co. Stafford, in 1181, aged about 34. His lordship married Bertred, daughter of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Evereaux in Normandy. They were married 1169 when Bertred was just 14 years old. She died in 1227, aged about 71. They had a son, Randle III, who succeeded his father as Earl of Chester, but he died sine prole 1232. He had the Earldom of Lincoln from his great-grandmother Lucia, and he resigned this Earldom to his sister Hawise about 1230-1. She was the widow of Robert de Quincey, and their daughter Margaret married John de Lacy, to whom the Earldom of Lincoln was confirmed Nov. 22, 1232. He was Surety for Magna Charta and his daughter Maud married Richard de Clare, son of Gilbert son of Richard de Clare, last two Sureties, and from whom you descend through Robert Abell and John Whitney. Beside Randle III and Hawise, Hugh and Bertred had Mabil, married Hugh de Albini, died sine prole.He was the Earl of Chester. Also known as Hugh le Meschin; Earl of Chester, Vicomte d'Avranches in Normandy. He joined in the rebellion against King Henry II, was taken prisoner at Alnwick on July 13, 1174, and deprived of his Earldom. Though he was again in rebellion both in England and Normandy, his Earldom was restored January 1177 (Complete Peerage, Vol III:167).\n\nPost in soc.genealogy.medieval 13 September 2011 by Douglas Richardson on Bertrade de Montfort http://groups.google.com/group/soc.genealogy.medieval/browse_thread...\n\nComplete Peerage, 3 (1913): 167 (sub Chester) has a rather brief account of the life of Hugh, 6th Earl of Chester (died 1181).

So, it supports the information in CP but goes no further.]\n\nChecking various other sources, however, I've managed to piece together a few details of Countess Bertrade's life as widow not provided by Complete Peerage:\n\nSometime in the period, 1188–99, she witnessed a charter of her son, Ranulph, Earl of Chester. In the period, 1190–1200, she reached agreement with the abbot and convent of Troarn in Normandy regarding the construction of a mill and fishpond on the boundary between her wood and theirs. Sometime before 1194–1203, she exchanged lands with the canons of Repton. Sometime in the period, 1200–10, she granted to Ralph Carbonel, of Halton, Lincolnshire, for his homage and service of half a knight’s fee which he held of the said countess in Halton. In 1223 Richard Duket and Simon de Sees brought a plea of novel disseisin against her touching a tenement in Harmston, Lincolnshire. In 1226 she presented to the church of Waddington, Lincolnshire. In 1227 she arraigned an assize of last presentation to the church of Waddington, Lincolnshire against the abbot of St. Sever.\n\nThe last item comes from Farrer, Honors & Knights’ Fees, 2 (1924): 103, which may be seen in snippet view at the following weblink: http://books.google.com/books?ei=MPVvTt2dFKniiAKA4tH0Bg&ct=result&id=...\n\nThe original source for this record is Calendar of the Patent Rolls, 1225–1232 (1903): 156, which may be viewed at the following weblink: http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/patentrolls/h3v2/body/Henry3vol2page0156.pdf\n\nThe item in question is dated 31 March 1227.
