        "text": "Her parentage is recorded by Orderic Vitalis. The De Genere Comitum Flandrensium, Notæ Parisienses names \"Fulconi Richin Andegavensi comiti uxorem suam nomine Bertradam\" as second wife of King Philippe whom he abducted from her first husband after repudiating his first wife. Orderic Vitalis records that “Bertrada...Andegavorum comitissa”, fearing that her husband was about to treat her like his previous two wives, sought protection from “Philippo regi Francorum” who repudiated his own wife and married her, the ceremony being conducted by “Odo Bajocensis episcopus”. William of Tyre records this marriage. Pope Urban II at the Council of Autun excommunicated the king 16 Oct 1094, confirmed at the Council of Clermont 18/28 Nov 1095. The church finally admitted the validity of the marriage after the Council of Paris 2 Dec 1104. Orderic Vitalis alleges that Bertrade tried to poison her stepson Louis so her own sons could succeed to the throne. \"Fulco iunior Andegavensium comes Fulconis comitis filius\" donated property to the abbey of Fontevraud with the consent of \"Bertrade regina matre meo, Philipo fratre meo\" by charter dated to [1109/1112/13]. 1"
