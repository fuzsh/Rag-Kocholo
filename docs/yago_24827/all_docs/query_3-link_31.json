Richardson states that Hugh of Cyfeiliog was born about 1141, since he was of age in 1162.[1] Wikipedia states that Hugh of Cyfeiliog the 5th Earl of Chester was born in 1147, possibly in Cyfeiliog, which since 1996 has been part of Gwynedd.[3] He is sometimes called Hugh of Cyfeiliog, because, according to a late writer, he was born in that district of Wales.[1] Hugh is thought by some to have taken his name from Kevelioc in Monmouth as his birthplace, but others think that instead he was born in, and took the name of Cyfeiliog [4] (in modern Powys) in the southern part of the Kingdom of Powys, Wales.\n\nThe marriage of Bertrada/Bertrade/Bertred[5] de Montfort, the daughter of Simon III, surnamed the Bald, count of Evreux and Montfort, and Hugh took place before 1171,[4] in 1169 in Montfort, Normandy, or Montfort, Eure, Haute-Normandie, France. She was the cousin of King Henry, who gave her away in marriage. His parents were Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester and his wife Maud of Gloucester[3] Hugh was 6th earl of Chester, hereditary Vicomte of Avranches in Normandy, seigneur of Saint Sever and Briquessart, son and heir of Ranulph.[1] Hugh of Cyfeiliog, 5th Earl of Chester (1147 – 1181), also written Hugh de Kevilioc, was an Anglo-Norman magnate who was active in England, Wales, Ireland and France during the reign of King Henry II of England.[2] Alternatively, the \"Visitation of Cheshire 1580\" says Hugh's wife was Beatrix the daughter of Richard Lord Lucy Justice of England.\n\nRichardson states that Hugh and his wife Bertrade had one son, Ranulph, and five daughters, Maud, Mabel, Agnes, Hawise, and a fifth daughter who married Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, Prince of North Wales. [1] Other sources identify only the four named daughters, and list the unknown daughter who married Llywelyn among the illigitimate children.\n\nHugh's five legitimate children by Bertrade are listed below:\n\nMaude/Matilda,[4] oldest daughter,[1] married David of Scotland,[5] 8th Earl of Huntingdon, (1171-1233); Maud, married David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon.[2] Maud, the mother of John the Scot, with whom the line of Hugh of Avranches became extinct; [4] Mabel (Chester) of Huntingdon, born Chester 1171[6] See also Mabel (Meschines) d'Aubeney, born Cheseter 1172 [6] Mabel/Mabill, second daughter, married William Albini[4]/d'Aubigny/d'Albiney,[5] 3rd Earl of Arundel; Named by Richardson as second of five daughters. [1] Mabel of Chester[3]Mabel, married William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel.[2] Mabel; [4]\n\nAgnes Of Chester,[4] third daughter, married William de Ferrers,[5] 4th Earl of Derby (died 2 November 1247); Agnes of Chester, legitimate daughter of Hugh, Earl of Chester, and his wife Bertrade. [7] Agnes of Chester[3] Agnes, married William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby.[2] Agnes; [4] Agnes (Meschines) de Ferrers, born Cheseter 1174[6]\n\nRanulf/Ranulph/Randulf De Blundeville,[4] [5] 6th Earl of Chester. Named by Richardson as son. [1] Ranulf III of Chester[3] Ranulf III became 6th Earl of Chester but died childless in 1232, when his four legitimate sisters became his heirs. [2] His only legitimate son Ranulf III succeeded him as Earl of Chester.[4] Ranulf (Meschines) of Chester, born Oswestry 1172[6]\n\nHawise Of Chester,[4] fourth daughter, married Robert II de Quincy,[5], (1180-1242);Named by Richardson as third of five daughters. [1] Hawise of Chester[3] Hawise, married Robert II de Quincy.[2] Hawise.[4] Hawise (Kevelioc) de Quincy, born Chester 1180 [6]\n\nHis additional children by other women are listed on his profile.\n\nBenefactions\n\nDuring his life Hugh made grants to St Werburgh's Abbey at Chester, to Stanlow Abbey, to St Mary's Priory at Coventry, to Bullington Priory, to Greenfield Priory, to Trentham Priory, and to Bordesley Abbey. He also confirmed grants of his parents to Calke Abbey, to St Mary-on-the-Hill, Chester, and to the Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen, in Normandy.[2]\n\nDeaths\n\nBertrade's husband, Hugh, died on 30 June, 1181, in Leek, Staffordshire.[4] He was buried beside his father at the chapter-house of St. Werburgs, Chester, which is now the cathedral.[4]\n\nBertrade survived him, dying on 12 July, 1189, or in 1227 at Évreux, Eure, Haute-Normandie, France.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 Douglas Richardson, Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, ed.
