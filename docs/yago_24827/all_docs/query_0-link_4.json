        "text": "Es incredible creer, mi numero 26 bisabuelita\n\nBertrade de Montfort was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evereaux.\n\nShe first married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou having a son named Fulk of Jerusalem.\n\nShe married second, Philip I of France and had:\n\n* Philip of France, Count of Mantes (living in 1123)\n\n* Fleury of France, Seigneur of Nangis (living in 1118)\n\n* Cecile of France (died 1145)\n\nThese were her only marriages and only children.\n\nAny inconsistencies are due to erroneous merging of trees by multiple Geni-users. There were a couple Bertrade's with fathers named Simon who were merged. They were of 2 different generations, thus causing multiple errors with children, husbands and close family members. This shall be fixed soon.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrade_de_Montfort\n\nBertrade de Montfort (c. 1070-14 February 1117) was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux. Her brother was Amauri de Montfort.\n\nMarriages\n\nThe oft-married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou was married to the mother of his son in 1089, when the lovely Bertrade caught his eye. According to the chronicler John of Marmoutier:\n\nThe lecherous Fulk then fell passionately in love with the sister of Amaury of Montfort, whom no good man ever praised save for her beauty. For her sake, he divorced the mother of Geoffrey II Martel…\n\nBertrade and Fulk were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk, but in 1092 Bertrade left her husband and took up with King Philip I of France. Philip married her on May 15, 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade. Astonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.\n\nChildren\n\nBertrade and Philipe had three children together:\n\nPhilippe de France, Count of Mantes (living in 1123)\n\nFleury de France, seigneur of Nangis (living in 1118)\n\nCecile of France (died 1145), married (1) Tancred, Prince of Galilee; married (2) Pons of Tripoli\n\nLater Life\n\nAccording to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philip, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis first through the arts of sorcery, and then through poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philip in 1108. Bertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: \"Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.\" Her son from her first marriage was Fulk V of Anjou who later became King of Jerusalem iure uxoris (english: through the wife's right). The dynasties founded by Fulk's sons ruled for centuries, one of them in England (Plantagenet), the other in Jerusalem.\n\nSources\n\nAncestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America Before 1700 By Frederick Lewis Weis, Lines 50-25, 118-23.\n\nOrderic Vitalis\n\nWilliam of Malmesbury\n\nFrench royalty\n\nPreceded by\n\nBertha of Holland Queen consort of the Franks\n\n1092 – 1108 Succeeded by\n\nAdelaide de Maurienne\n\n[hide]v • d • eChronology of French Queens and Empresses\n\nMedieval France (987–1328)\n\nHouse of Capet Adelaide of Aquitaine (987–996) • Rozala of Italy (996) • Bertha of Burgundy (996-1000) • Constance of Arles (1003-1031) • Matilda of Frisia (1034–1044) • Anne of Kiev (1051–1060) • Bertha of Holland (1071–1092) • Bertrade de Montfort (1092–1108) • Adélaide de Maurienne (1115–1137) • Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine (1137–1152) • Constance of Castile (1154–1160) • Adèle of Champagne (1164–1180) • Isabelle of Hainaut (1180–1190) • Ingeborg of Denmark (1193-1193) • Agnes of Merania (1196–1200) • Ingeborg of Denmark (1200–1223) • Blanche of Castile (1223 – 1226) • Marguerite of Provence (1234-1270) • Isabella of Aragon (1270-1271) • Maria of Brabant (1274-1285) • Joan I of Navarre (1285-1305) • Margaret of Burgundy (1314-1315) • Clementia of Hungary (1315-1316) • Joan II, Countess of Burgundy (1316-1322) • Blanche of Burgundy (1322) • Maria of Luxembourg (1322-1324) • Jeanne d'Évreux (1325-1328)\n\nMedieval France (1328–1498)\n\nHouse of Valois Joan the Lame (1328–1348) • Blanche of Navarre (1350) • Joan, Countess of Auvergne (1350–1360) • Joanna of Bourbon (1364–1378) • Isabeau of Bavaria (1385–1422) • Marie of Anjou (1422–1461) • Charlotte of Savoy (1461–1483) • Anne of Brittany (1491-1498)\n\nEarly Modern France (1498–1515)\n\nHouse of Valois-Orléans Joan of Valois (1498) • Anne, Duchess of Brittany (1498-1514) • Mary of England\n\nEarly Modern France (1515–1589)\n\nHouse of Valois-Angoulême Claude, Duchess of Brittany (1515–1524) • Eleanor of Habsburg (1530–1547) • Catherine de' Medici (1547–1559) • Mary I of Scotland (1559–1560) • Elisabeth of Austria (1570–1574) • Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont (1575-1589)\n\nEarly Modern France (1589–1792)\n\nHouse of Bourbon Marguerite de Valois (1589–1599) • Marie de' Medici (1600–1610) • Anne of Austria (1615–1643) • Maria Theresa of Spain (1660–1683) • Françoise d'Aubigné (1685–1715) • Maria Leszczyńska (1725–1768) • Marie Antoinette of Austria (1774-1792) • Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy (1795-1810)\n\nFirst Empire (1804–1814)\n\nHouse of Bonaparte Josephine de Beauharnais (1804–1810) • Marie Louise of Austria (1810-1814)\n\nBourbon Restoration (1814, 1815–1830)\n\nHouse of Bourbon Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte of France (1830) (disputed)\n\nJuly Monarchy (1830–1848)\n\nHouse of Orléans Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies (1830–1848)\n\nSecond Empire (1852–1870)\n\nHouse of Bonaparte Eugénie de Montijo (1853–1870)\n\nBertrade de Montfort (c. 1070-February 14, 1117) was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux.

The oft-married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, was married to the mother of his son Geoffrey in 1089, when the lovely Bertrade caught his eye. According to the chronicler John of Marmoutier: \"The lecherous Fulk then fell passionately in love with the sister of Amaury of Montfort [that would be Bertrade], whom no good man ever praised save for her beauty. For her sake, he divorced the mother of Geoffrey II Martel…\"\n\nBertrade and Fulk were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk, but in 1092 Bertrade left her husband and took up with King Philip I of France. (Other histories say she was \"abducted\" by the King, but I bet she was happy to go.) Philip married her on May 15, 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamored of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade.\n\nAstonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.\n\nBertrade bore three children with King Philip (who already had four children, including his heir Louis [our ancestor], with his first wife). According to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philip, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis first through the arts of sorcery, and then through poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philip in 1108.\n\nBertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: \"Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.\"\n\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrade_de_Montfort for more information.\n\nSource: The book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'.\n\nBertrade de Montfort (c. 1070-February 14, 1117) was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux.

The oft-married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, was married to the mother of his son Geoffrey in 1089, when the lovely Bertrade caught his eye. According to the chronicler John of Marmoutier: \"The lecherous Fulk then fell passionately in love with the sister of Amaury of Montfort [that would be Bertrade], whom no good man ever praised save for her beauty. For her sake, he divorced the mother of Geoffrey II Martel…\"\n\nBertrade and Fulk were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk, but in 1092 Bertrade left her husband and took up with King Philip I of France. (Other histories say she was \"abducted\" by the King, but I bet she was happy to go.) Philip married her on May 15, 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamored of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade.\n\nAstonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.\n\nBertrade bore three children with King Philip (who already had four children, including his heir Louis [our ancestor], with his first wife). According to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philip, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis first through the arts of sorcery, and then through poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philip in 1108.\n\nBertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: \"Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.\"\n\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrade_de_Montfort for more information.\n\nSource: The book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'.\n\nBertrade de Montfort (c. 1070-February 14, 1117) was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux.
