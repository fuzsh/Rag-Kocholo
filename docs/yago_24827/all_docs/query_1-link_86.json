        "text": "Bishop William Barlow was born about 1498 in Essex, England to Robert Barlow and his wife, Anna. William, along with three of his four brothers, all entered the clergy at a time of religious change in England. Because there were three active Bishops by the name Barlow and William’s son were also clergy it has at times been confusing as to which “Barlow” is being referenced in historical documents from the time of Henry VIII to Elizabeth I. It is also believed that he may be Friar Jerome who is considered the author of a number of satirical pieces that attacked Cardinal Thomas Wolsley. Knowing the family history with Woosley it would not be surprising (two of William’s brothers were confidants to Anne Boylen). He was the author of “On the Luthern Factions.” During the reign of Mary I he spent time in the Tower of London. Later he and his family were exiled in Germany and he met many Protestant reformers there including Martin Luther. He later went to Poland before returning to England when Elizabeth was crowned. He also contributed to The Institution of the Christian Man.\n\nReligiously he was a staunch reformer who was behind selling church properties and breaking up the monastaries among other things. He did not believe that confession was biblical and purgatory did not exist. He also was for translating the Bible into English.\n\nWhile there is little evidence that he took an active role in the court of Henry VIII he was sent to James V of Scotland at least twice on the King’s behalf. During the second visit his stay was extended on behalf of Margaret Tudor, the king’s sister. While at Holyrood Palace William presented James with the Order of the Garter.\n\nWilliam is considered the first English bishop to wed. He married Agatha Wellsbourne before 1544, the marriage was before the demand for clerical celibacy was lifted. Their five daughters all married bishops and their oldest son also became a bishop.\n\nWilliam had been Bishop of St. Asaph, St. Davids, and Chichester.\n\nWilliam died in 1568.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://alchetron.com/William-Barlow-(bishop-of-Chichester)\n\nhttp://cupboardworld.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-barlow-brides-of-bishops.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barlow_(bishop_of_Chichester)\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/2860127?read-now=1&loggedin=true&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/507699?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n\nSchwartz-Leeper, Gavin, From Princes to Pages: The Literary Lives of Cardinal Wolsey, Tudor England …\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5HvnDaAaV0\n\nChristopher Barkar (turned Barker) was born in 1529 in England to Edward Barkar and Joyce Burton. He had inherited wealth and position through his great uncle Sir Christopher Baker, a Garter Knight at Arms and a Knight of the Bath. In 1569 he began to have others print books for him, mostly Bibles and prayer books and in 1576 he obtained his own press. That year he printed copies of the Bible in two different versions. On September 27, 1577 for about $3,000 pounds he purchased a patent, or business license, which granted him the ability to use the title Queen’s Printer. “The full patent granted to Barker the office of royal printer of all statutes, books, bills, Acts of Parliament, proclamations, injunctions, Bibles, and New Testaments, in the English tongue of any translation, all service books to be used in churches, and all other volumes ordered to be printed by the Queen or Parliament.”1 He obtained the patent for his son and later his grandsons. He retired after 1588 and at that time he and his deputies had printed 70 editions of the Bible. He died November 29, 1599.\n\nOne thing that Christopher would not print were books of music and he would not provide shelves for them either.\n\nSources\n\nhttp://www.datchethistory.org.uk/Link%20Articles/link_barker.htm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Barker_(printer) 1\n\nLuckombe, Philip, A Concise History of the Origin and Progress of Printing: With Practical Instructions to the Trade in GeneralJanuary 1770, accessed via Google Play on April 9, 2018\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5dgw6j/im_christopher_barker_the_queens_printer_where_do/\n\nStephen, Sir Leslie, ed.; London, England: Oxford University Press; Dictionary of National Biography, Volumes 1-20, 22; Volume: Vol 01; Page: 1115\n\nSmith, Jeremy L., Thomas East and Music Publishing in Renaissance England Oxford University Press 2003,, accessed via Google Play on April 9, 2018\n\nErmentrude of Orléans (also known as Hirmentrude and Irmintrud) was born September 27, 823 in France. She was the daughter of Odo, Count of Orléans and Engeltrude of Fezensac. On December 13, 842 she married Charles the Bald and proceeded to have about 10 kids (some records say only 9). The marriage made her Empress of the Holy Roman Empire and Queen of West Francia (yeah we didn’t leave the Frankish queens completely yet). Other than popping out heirs her hobbies were embroidery, which she was renowned for and abbeys. Charles presented her with the Abbey of Chelles and at least four of her children entered the church though Lothar didn’t remain there. In 866 her brother William was charged with treason and was executed by her husband. She didn’t appreciate that much at left him to join a nunnery. She died October 6, 869 and is buried at Basilique Saint-Denis, Paris, France.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=21072\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermentrude_of_Orl%C3%A9ans\n\nhttp://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/onthisday-in-823-ermentrude-of-orleans-mother-of-judith-of-flanders-was-born-68877\n\nhttp://todayinwomenshistory.saintssistersandsluts.com/ermentrude-of-orleans-and-judith-of-flanders/\n\nhttp://uk.tourisme93.com/basilica/ermentrude-of-orleans.html\n\nErmesinde of Carcassonne was born about 972 in France, she was the daughter Roger I of Carcassonne. In 993 she married Ramon Borell with whom she had three children, Borrell Ramon (who died as a child), Berenguer Ramon and Estefania, also known as Adelaide. She was politically active through her husband’s life, where she presided over tribunals and assemblies and dealt with finances and when he died in 1018 she became regent for their son. Berenguer Ramon I died a in 1035 and she became regent again for her grandson. During her lifetime they were often at war with the Muslims in Iberia, her son wasn’t big on warring but mom sure was since their presence and her son’s attempts at peace irritated the nobles. She was also the driving force behind Pope Victor II excommunicating grandson Ramon Berenguer I and Almodis de la Marche (yeah remember them). She continued as regent until 1044 when she was declared too old. She died March 1, 1058 in Cataluna, Spain and is buried at Cathedral of Saint Mary of Girona\n\nSources\n\nhttp://catalina-de-aragon.tumblr.com/post/115519291697/ermesinde-of-carcassonne-972-1058-she-was\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sepulchre_of_Ermesinde_of_Carcassonne_(Cathedral_of_Girona)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermesinde_of_Carcassonne\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=149183195\n\nBertrade de Montfort , Queen Consort of the Franks was born around 1070 to Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux. Her parents died while she was a teen and she was left to the guardianship of her older brother, Amaury. She was married to Fulk IV, Count of Anjou also known as Fulk le Réchin, about 1089 (she was his fifth known wife, he like to repudiate his wives) and they had a son together, Fulk, Count of Anjou and King of Jerusalem. With Fulk having a nickname that seems to indicate he was a bit of a jerk and with contemporary chronicler, John of Marmoutier claimed, “The lecherous Fulk then fell passionately in love with the sister of Amaury de Montfort, whom no good man ever praised save for her beauty.”1 This sounds like a “bad boy” fell in love with a “bad girl” which is probably right since in 1092 she ran off or was “kidnapped” by King Philip I of France. The pair married on May 15, 1092 much to the chagrin of their spouses. Bertrade didn’t see it as a big deal and expected Philip and Fulk to be friends. Philip repudiated Bertha claiming that she got too fat and locked her up in the fortress of Montreuil sur Mer. Neither Hugh of Die nor Pope Urban II agreed and the pair was excommunicated. In 1095 and poor Philip wasn’t allowed to run off and join the First Crusade. Philip and Betrade had three children, Philip, Fleury and Cecile.\n\nBertrade made the annals of another chronicler, this time, Orderic Vitalis, who claimed that she was so concerned with making sure one of her sons succeeded Philip that she wrote to Henry I of England to have Philip’s oldest son, Louis, arrested. (Some claimed she was behind the death of his son Geoffroy on May 19, 1106 from a ‘friendly fire’ arrow.) He also claimed she used witchcraft and poison against her stepson but to no avail, he succeeded his father in 1108. Betrade lived on and according to William of Malmesbury, a 12th Century historian and monk “Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.”, 1 Not sure about witchcraft and joining a convent a few years later but stranger things have happened. She died February 14, 1117.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrade_de_Montfort 1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulk_IV,_Count_of_Anjou\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orderic_Vitalis\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_I_of_France\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury\n\nhttp://favoritesroyales.canalblog.com/archives/2011/04/29/21008654.html\n\nhttp://www.france-pittoresque.com/spip.php?article2256\n\nMarguerite de Sablé was born abou 1179 in France to Robert de Sable and Clémence de Mayenne. She was the eldest of three children, only two of which survived to adulthood. Her brother, Robert, died as a child and her younger sister was Phillipa. Her father was a Grand Master of the Knights Templar and died in the Holy Land on September 23, 1193. At this point Marguerite had been married for two years to William des Roches, Seneschal of Anjou, a knight in the Third Crusade, she was second wife. Her father’s death made the young couple extrememly wealthy and William a very powerful man. The pair had three children, Robert who died young as his uncle before him, Jeanne and Clemence. William died on July 15, 1222.\n\nShe supported the two abbeys that her father founded. In 1200 she lands to the abbey at Perray aux Nonnains which her uncle added to. And in 1209 they had the abbey at Perray-Nauf moved to closer to Sable. In 1227 she donated to the nuns at the Abbey at Bonlieu to pray for the souls of her departed family. In 1235 she supported the monks at the Church of St. Nicholas of Sable.\n\nMarguerite died in 1238 (around the same time as their daughter Jeanne) and is buried in Perray-aux-Nonnains, France while her heart is buried with William at the Abbey at Bonlieu.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_de_Sabl%C3%A9\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=84100973&amp;ref=acom\n\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_de_Sabl%C3%A9\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erIGJLbUZ70\n\nBertrada of Prüm was born about 670, her parentage is uncertain and there are three main possibilities (well 2.5, two of them can both be true). Her husband has been lost to time though his mother was most likely Irmina who was the daughter of Hugobert and Chariveus, Count of Laon. What is known is that she had three children, Hardrad, whom she outlived, Charibert of Laon and Weta who married Cario. She and Charibert founded the Benedictine Abbey at Prum in Lorraine on July 23, 720, they also made donations to the Abbey of Echternach. Through Charibert she is the great grandmother of Charlomagne and well almost everyone in my family tree.\n\nSources\n\nPrüm Abbey\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrada_of_Pr%C3%BCm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charibert_of_Laon\n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12519a.htm\n\nMargaret Wake, 3rd Baroness Wake of Liddell and Countess of Kent was born was born about 1297 to John Wake and Joan de Fiennes. When she was about 15, so in 1312, she married John Comyn who was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on June 24, 1314. Their son, Aymer, died as a toddler in 1316. At Christmas time in 1325, she received dispensation to wed again, this time to Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. The pair had four children before he was beheaded for treason in 1330. She and the three children had been imprisoned as well, the youngest John was not yet born when her brother was also accused but was later pardoned. When Edward III took control of his crown he brought Margaret and her children to his household and treated them as if they were his family, which helped lead to Joan’s marriage to Prince Edward. She gained the title of Baroness of Wake but it was short lived, she died in the fall of 1349 of plague.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bannockburn\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Wake,_3rd_Baroness_Wake_of_Liddell\n\nhttp://www.ranker.com/list/famous-people-who-died-of-bubonic-plague/reference?page=8"
