King Philip of France I\n\nCount Philip of Mantes\n\nSeigneur Fleury of Nangis\n\nCecile of France\n\nBertrade de Montfort\n\nBorn: 1059\n\nMarriage (1): Count Fulk of Anjou IV\n\nMarriage (2): King Philip of France I on 15 May 1092\n\nDied: 14 Feb 1117 aged 58\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nBertrade and Fulk were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk, but in 1092 Bertrade left her husband and took up with King Philip I of France. Philip married her on 15 May 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade. Astonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.\n\nBertrade married Count Fulk of Anjou IV, son of Count Geoffrey of Gâtinais and Ermengarde of Anjou. (Count Fulk of Anjou IV was born in 1043 in Château Landon, France 1 and died on 14 Apr 1109 in Angers, Anjou, , Rhône-Alpes, FRA 1.)\n\nBertrade next married King Philip of France I on 15 May 1092. (King Philip of France I was born on 23 May 1052 and died on 29 Jul 1108.)"
