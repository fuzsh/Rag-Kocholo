        "text": "Eleanor of England (also called Eleanor Plantagenet [1] and Eleanor of Leicester) (1215 – 13 April 1275) was the youngest child of King John of England and Isabelle of Angouleme.\n\nAt the time of Eleanor's birth, King John's London was conquered and Queen Isabella was in shame. He had been forced to sign the Magna Carta. Eleanor would never meet her father, as he died at Newark Castle when she was barely a year old. The French, led by Philip II of France, were marching through the south. The only lands loyal to her brother, Henry III, were in the middle and southwest. The barons ruled the north, but they united with the royalists under William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who protected the young king, and Philip was defeated.\n\nWilliam Marshal died in 1219 and Eleanor was promised to his son, also named William. They were married on 23 April 1224 at New Temple Church in London. The younger William was 34 and Eleanor only nine. He died in London on 6 April 1231, days before their 7th anniversary. There were no children of this marriage. The widowed Eleanor swore a holy oath of chastity in the presence of Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nSeven years later, she met Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. According to Matthew Paris, Simon was attracted to Eleanor's beauty and elegance as well as her wealth and high birth. They fell in love and married secretly on 7 January 1238 at the King's chapel at Westminster Palace. Her brother King Henry later alleged that he only allowed the marriage because Simon had seduced Eleanor. The marriage was controversial because of the oath Eleanor had sworn several years before to remain chaste. Because of this, Simon made a pilgrimage to Rome seeking papal approval for their union. Simon and Eleanor would have seven children:\n\nHenry de Montfort (November 1238-1265)\n\nSimon the younger de Montfort (April 1240-1271)\n\nAmaury de Montfort, Canon of York (1242/1243-1300)\n\nGuy de Montfort, Count of Nola (1244-1288)\n\nA daughter, born and died in Bordeaux between 1248 and 1251.\n\nRichard de Montfort (1252-1266)\n\nEleanor de Montfort (1258-1282)\n\nSimon de Montfort had the real power behind the throne, but when he tried to take the throne, he was defeated with his son at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265. Eleanor fled to exile in France where she became a nun at Montargis Abbey, a nunnery founded by her deceased husband's sister Amicia. She died and was buried there on 13 April 1275. Elizabeth Woodville, Queen -Consort of King Edward IV was her direct descendant.1Waleran de Beaumont, Count of Meulan, 1st Earl of Worcester (1104 – 9 April 1166, Preaux), was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth de Vermandois, and the twin brother of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester. He is not referred to by any surname in a contemporary document other than 'Waleran son of Count Robert'.\n\nWaleran was born in 1104, the eldest of twin sons of Robert de Beaumont, count of Meulan, who was also to become earl of Leicester in 1107. On their father's death in June 1118, the boys came into the wardship of King Henry I of England. They remained in his care till late in 1120 when they were declared adult and allowed to succeed to their father's lands by a division already arranged between the king and their father before his death. By the arrangement, Waleran succeeded to the county of Meulan upriver on the Seine from the Norman border, and the principal family Norman honors of Beaumont and Pont Audemer. His great possessions included the forest of Brotonne, which was centred on his castle of Vatteville on the left bank of the Seine. As part of the family arrangement, Waleran also received a large estate in Dorset centred on the manor of Sturminster Marshall.1Reginald de Dunstanville (Reginald FitzRoy, Rainald ), 1st Earl of Cornwall (French: Renaud de Donstanville or de Dénestanville ) (c. 1110, Dunstanville, Kent, England – 1 July 1175, Chertsey, Surrey, England), Sheriff of Devon, Earl of Cornwall, was an illegitimate son of Henry I of England and Lady Sybilla Corbet.\n\nReginald had been invested with the Earldom of Cornwall by King Stephen of England, but having afterwards taken up the cause of the Empress Matilda, his sister, he forfeited his lands and honours. Around 1173 he granted a charter to his free bugesses of Triueru, and he addressed his meetings at Truro to All men both Cornish and English suggesting a continuing differentiation.\n\nHe was buried in Reading Abbey.\n\nHe married Mabel FitzRichard, daughter of William FitzRichard (who held a number of fiefs in Cornwall) and had the following children:\n\nNicholas de Dunstanville (1136–1175).\n\nHawyse (or Denise) de Dunstanville (1138–21 April 1162). Married Richard de Redvers, 2nd Earl of Devon (Richard de Reviers).\n\nMaud FitzRoy de Dunstanville of Cornwall (b. 1143, Dunstanville, Kent, England). Married Sir Robert de Beaumont, Count of Meulan.\n\nUrsula de Dunstanville (b. 1145). Married Walter de Dunstanville Lord Castlecomb.\n\nSarah de Dunstanville (b. 1147). Married Ademar V, viscount of Limoges.\n\nReginald de Dunstanville (b. c. 1152).\n\nJoan FitzRoy (b. c. 1150). Married Ralph de Valletort, Lord of Trematon.\n\nHe also had illegitimate children by Beatrice de Vaux, who was later married to William Brewer (justice).\n\nHenry FitzCount, Sheriff of Cornwall, Earl of Cornwall (d. 1222).\n\nWilliam FitzCount.1Empress Matilda, also known as Matilda of England or Maude (c. 7 February 1102 – 10 September 1167) was the daughter and heir of King Henry I of England. Matilda and her younger brother, William Adelin, were the only legitimate children of King Henry to survive to adulthood. Her brother died in the White ship disaster, making Matilda the last heir from the paternal line of her grandfather William the Conqueror.\n\nAs a child, Matilda was betrothed to and later married Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, acquiring the title Empress. The couple had no known children. When widowed, she was married to Geoffrey of Anjou, with whom she had three sons, the eldest of whom became King Henry II of England.\n\nMatilda was the first female ruler of the Kingdom of England. However, the length of her effective rule was brief — a few months in 1141. She was never crowned and failed to consolidate her rule (legally and politically). For this reason, she is normally excluded from lists of English monarchs, and her rival (and cousin) Stephen of Blois is listed as monarch for the period 1135-1154. Their rivalry for the throne led to years of unrest and civil war in England that have been called The Anarchy. She did secure her inheritance of the Duchy of Normandy — through the military feats of her husband, Geoffrey —and campaigned unstintingly for her oldest son's inheritance, living to see him ascend the throne in 1154.\n\nMatilda was the first of two children born to Henry I of England and his wife Matilda of Scotland (also known as Edith).\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Margaret was daughter of Edward the Exile and granddaughter of Edmund II of England. (Most historians believe Matilda was born at Winchester, but one, John Fletcher (1990), argues for the possibility of the royal palace at Sutton Courtenay in Oxfordshire.)1Henry V (8 November 1086 – 23 May 1125) was King of Germany (from 1098 - 1125) and Holy Roman Emperor (from 1106 - 1125), the fourth and last ruler of the Salian dynasty. Henry's reign coincided with the final phase of the great Investiture Controversy, which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, he surrendered to the demands of the second generation of Gregorian reformers.\n\nHe was a son of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Bertha of Savoy. His maternal grandparents were Otto of Savoy and Adelaide of Susa.\n\nOn 6 January 1099, his father Henry IV had him crowned King of Germany at Aachen in place of his older brother, the rebel Conrad. He promised to take no part in the business of the Empire during his father's lifetime, but was induced by his father's enemies to revolt in 1104, and some of the princes did homage to him at Mainz in January 1105. Despite the initial setbacks of the rebels, Henry IV was forced to abdicate and died soon after. Order was soon restored in Germany, the citizens of Cologne were punished with a fine, and an expedition against Robert II, Count of Flanders, brought this rebel to his knees.\n\nIn 1107, Henry undertook a campaign to restore Borivoi II in Bohemia, which was only partially successful. Henry summoned Svatopluk the Lion, who was had captured Duke Borivoi. Borivoi was released at the emperor's command and made godfather to Svatopluk's new son. Nevertheless, on Svatopluk's return to Bohemia, he assumed the throne. In 1108, Henry went to war with Coloman of Hungary on behalf of Prince Álmos. An attack by Boleslaus III of Poland and Borivoi on Svatopluk forced Henry to give up his campaign. Instead, he invaded Poland to compel them to renew their accustomed tribute, but was defeated at the Battles of Glogów and the Hundsfeld. In 1110, he succeeded in securing the dukedom of Bohemia for Ladislaus I.1Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare, d. 15 April 1136. was a Norman nobleman, the son of Gilbert Fitz Richard de Clare and Adeliza de Claremont. He founded the priory of Tonbridge.\n\nRichard held the Lordship of Ceredigion in Wales. A Welsh revolt against Norman rule had begun in south Wales where, on 1 January 1136 the Welsh won a victory over the local Norman forces between Loughor and Swansea.\n\nRichard had been away from his lordship in the early part of the year. Returning to the borders of Wales in April, he ignored warnings of the danger and pressed on toward Ceredigion with only a small force. He had not gone far when on 15 April he was ambushed and killed by the men of Gwent under Iorwerth ab Owain and his brother Morgan, grandsons of Caradog ap Gruffydd, in a woody tract called \"the ill-way of Coed Grano\", near Llanthony Abbey, north of Abergavenny.1Richard fitz Gilbert (c. 1030 - 1091), was a Norman lord who participated in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. He was also known as \"de Bienfaite\", \"de Clare\", and \"de Tonbridge\".[1]\n\nAccording to the medieval chronicler Gerald of Wales, the first of this great family, Richard de Clare, was the eldest son of Gilbert, surnamed Crispin, Count of Brionne, in Normandy. This Richard fitz-Gilbert came into England with William the Conqueror, and received from him great advancement in honour and possessions.[2]\n\nDNB and other sources are vague and sometimes contradictory about when the name de Clare came into common usuage, but what we do know is that Richard fitz Gilbert (of Tonbridge) is once referred to as Richard of Clare in the Suffolk return of the Domesday Book.[3]\n\nHe was rewarded with 176 lordships and large grants of land in England, including the right to build the castles of Clare and of Tonbridge. Richard fitz Gilbert received the lordship of Clare, in Suffolk, where parts of the wall of Clare Castle still stand.[4] He was thus Lord of Clare. Some contemporaneous and later sources called him Earl of Clare, though many modern sources view the title as a \"styled title\". See: Style (manner of address)\n\nHe served as Joint Chief Justiciar in William's absence, and played a major part in suppressing the revolt of 1075.\n\nOn William's death, Richard and other great Norman barons, including Odo of Bayeux, Robert, Count of Mortain , William fitz Osbern and Geoffrey of Coutances, led a rebellion against the rule of William Rufus in order to place Robert Curthose on the throne. However, most Normans in England remained loyal. William Rufus and his army successfully attacked the rebel strongholds at Tonbridge, Pevensey and Rochester.[5]\n\nHe was buried in St. Neot's Priory in 1091. His widow was still living in 1113. His lands were inherited by his son, Gilbert fitz Richard.\n\nHe was the son of Gilbert \"Crispin\", Count of Brionne, grandson of Richard I of Normandy. In spite of this, sources as far back as the Annals of the Four Masters claim that Richard's great-grandson, Richard \"Strongbow\", was the direct descendant of Robert \"the Devil\", father of William the Conqueror.\n\nRichard married Rohese Giffard, daughter of Sir Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville and Agnes Flaitel, and had 7 children.1William d'Aubigny or D'Aubeney or d'Albini, Lord of Belvoir (died 1 May 1236) was a prominent member of the baronial rebellions against King John of England.\n\nWilliam was the son of William d'Aubigny of Belvoir and grandson of William d'Aubigny (Brito), and was heir to Domesday Book landholder Robert de Todeni, who held many properties, possibly as many as eighty, among them was one in Leicestershire, where he built Belvoir Castle. This was his family's home for many generations.[1]\n\nWilliam stayed neutral at the beginning of the troubles of King John's reign, only joining the rebels after the early success in taking London in 1215. He was one of the twenty-five sureties or guarantors of the Magna Carta. In the war that followed the signing of the charter, he held Rochester Castle for the barons, and was imprisoned (and nearly hanged) after John captured it. He became a loyalist on the accession of Henry III, and was a commander at the Second Battle of Lincoln in 1217.\n\nHe died on 1 May 1236, at Offington, Leicestershire, and was buried at Newstead Abbey and \"his heart under the wall, opposite the alter at Belvoir Castle\".[1] He was succeeded by his son, another William d'Aubigny, who died in 1247 and left only daughters. One of them was Isabel, a co-heiress, who married Robert de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros (c. 1212-1301), thus adding the Aubigny co-guarantor of the Magna Carta to the pedigree of George Washington, 1st president of the USA.1Hugh de Kevelioc, Earl of Chester (1147 – 30 June 1181) was the son of Ranulf de Gernon and Maud of Gloucester, daughter of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (otherwise known as Robert de Caen, the illegitimate son of Henry I of England, making her Henry's granddaughter).\n\nHe is thought to have been born Kevelioc in Monmouth. But he may have taken the name of, the cwmwd of Cyfeiliog (in modern Powys) in the southern part of the Kingdom of Powys, Wales.\n\nHe was underage when his father's death in 1153 made him heir to his family's estates on both sides of the channel. He joined the baronial Revolt of 1173–1174 against King Henry II of England, and was influential in convincing the Bretons to revolt. After being captured and imprisoned after the Battle of Alnwick, he finally got his estates restored in 1177, and served in King Henry's Irish campaigns.\n\nIn 1169 he married Bertrade D'Evreux, daughter of Simon III de Montfort. She was the cousin of King Henry, who gave her away in marriage. Their children were:\n\nRanulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester\n\nMaud of Chester (1171–1233), married David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon\n\nMabel of Chester, married William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel\n\nAgnes of Chester (died 2 November 1247), married William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby\n\nHawise of Chester (1180–1242), married Robert II de Quincy\n\nA daughter, name unknown, who was briefly married to Llywelyn Fawr\n\nHe also had an illegitimate daughter, Amice of Chester, who married Ralph de Mainwaring.\n\nHugh of Kevelioc died 30 June 1181 at Leek, Staffordshire, England.1"
