The chronicler John of Marmoutier described her as someone “whom no good man ever praised save for her beauty”.\n\nThough he was already married, the Count of Anjou, Fulk IV, fell passionately in love with Bertrade. They were married in 1089, and had a son, Fulk V.\n\nJust three years later, Bertrade left her husband for King Philip I of France. Bertrade and Phillip were married despite the fact that they both had spouses living. Incredibly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.\n\nPhillip’s passion for Bertrade was such that he refused to leave her even when he was excommunicated and prevented from taking part in the First Crusade.\n\nThe couple had three children and Bertrade is rumoured to have attempted to kill Phillip’s son Louis (her stepson) in order to have one of her sons become the heir."
