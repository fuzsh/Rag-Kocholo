        "text": "Philip I (c. 1052 – 29 July 1108), called the Amorous (French: L'Amoureux), was King of the Franks from 1060 to 1108. His reign, like that of most of the early Capetians, was extraordinarily long for the time. The monarchy began a modest recovery from the low it had reached during the reign of his father, Henry I, and he added the Vexin region and the viscountcy of Bourges to his royal domaine.\n\nKing of the Franks\n\nReign: 4 August 1060 - 29 July 1108\n\nCoronation: 23 May 1059 (as co-king)\n\nPredecessor: Henry I\n\nSuccessor: Louis VI\n\nRegents: Anne of Kiev & Baldwin V of Flanders (1060-1067)\n\nBorn: 23 May 1052\n\nCampagne-et-Fontaine\n\nDied: 29 July 1108 (aged 56)\n\nMelun\n\nBurial: Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire\n\nSpouse: Bertha of Holland (m. 1072; div. 1092)\n\nBertrade de Montfort (m. 1092)\n\nIssue: Constance, Princess of Antioch.\n\nLouis VI, King of France.\n\nHenry of France.\n\nPhilip, Count of Mantes.\n\nFleury, Seigneur of Nangis.\n\nCecile, Princess of Galilee.\n\nHouse: Capet\n\nFather: Henry I of France\n\nMother: Anne of Kiev\n\n____________________________________\n\nBertha of Holland (c. 1055 – 15 October 1094), also known as Berthe or Bertha of Frisia and erroneously as Berta or Bertrada, was Queen of France from 1072 until 1092, as the first wife of King Philip I of France. Bertha's marriage to the king in 1072 was a result of peace negotiations between him and her stepfather, Count Robert I of Flanders. After nine years of childlessness, the royal couple had three children, including Philip's successor, Louis VI. Philip, however, grew tired of his wife by 1090, and repudiated her in 1092 in order to marry the already married Bertrade of Montfort. That marriage was a scandal since both Philip and Bertrade were already married to other people, at least until Queen Bertha died the next year.\n\nQueen Consort of the Franks\n\nTenure: 1072 - 1092\n\nBorn: c. 1055\n\nVlaardingen, Netherlands\n\nDied: 15 October 1094 (aged 38-39)\n\nSpouse: Philip I of France (m. 1072; div. 1092)\n\nIssue: Constance, Princess of Antioch.\n\nLouis VI, King of France.\n\nHenry of France.\n\nHouse: Gerulfing\n\nFather: Floris I, Count of Holland\n\nMother: Gertrude of Saxony\n\nReligion: Roman Catholicism\n\n____________________________________\n\nBertrade of Montfort (c. 1070 – 14 February 1117), also known by other names, was a Norman noble from the House of Montfort. She was countess of Anjou (1089–1092) through her first marriage to Fulk the Rude and then queen consort of France (1092–1108) through her initially bigamous marriage to Philip I. Condemned in her era's ecclesiastical histories, she played a role in the popularization of pigache footwear and founded a daughter house of Fontevraud Abbey at Hautes-Bruyeres.\n\nQueen Consort of the Franks\n\nTenure: 15 May 1092 - 29 July 1108"
