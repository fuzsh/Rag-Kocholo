The data revealed several large-scale trends that are consistent with the historical context of the magazine. We found that faces are more likely to be smiling in the context of advertisements compared to other contexts, that women are more likely to be smiling than men in all contexts, and that women&rsquo;s faces are more likely to be found in advertisements than men&rsquo;s faces. We observed trends in the presence of racialized faces: African American faces increased more or less linearly, reaching approximately proportional representation at the turn of the twenty-first century, while the appearance of faces categorized as Asian peaked in 1970. We interpret these trends through a theoretical framework that connects them to larger events in American history.\n&nbsp;\nNous avons extrait et cat&eacute;goris&eacute; des images de visages humains &agrave; partir des archives num&eacute;ris&eacute;es du magazine Time, dont les num&eacute;ros ont &eacute;t&eacute; publi&eacute;s entre 1923 et 2014.

        "text": "Introduction\n\nWe base this work on the premise that images reflect socio-political-historical moments and their underlying power structures in novel ways, often overlooked by analyses that prize written language as the most authentic source of historical knowledge. Too often, as Peter Burke notes, “historians … prefer to deal with texts and political or economic facts, not the deeper levels of experience that images probe” (Burke 2001, 10). We begin with the proposition that political, economic, and cultural facts in the twentieth and twenty-first century are mediated through, and consecrated by, technologically reproduced—and increasingly, technologically generated—imagery. Ours is, as Guy Debord famously argued, a “society of the spectacle,” and so the traditional historian’s “condescension towards images” is becoming increasingly problematic in methodological terms (Debord 1995).\n\nIn addition to this, the visual historian’s toolkit has been radically expanded in recent years. Previously, it was difficult—if not impossible—to track and analyze the modern flood of imagery that has shaped our world, beginning in the twentieth century. As Lev Manovich argues, new digital technologies allow for the “computational analysis of cultural data,” which allows scholars to apprehend the true “scale” of modern visual production for the first time (Manovich 2020, 1). Once limited to close readings of a handful of select images, scholars can now recognize previously undetected or overlooked trends using digital methods on large collections of historical images, a development that has been dubbed the visual digital turn (Wevers and Smits 2020). The ability to leverage digital analytics to interpret and study images has defined the subdiscipline of the visual digital humanities (Münster and Terras 2020), in which this work belongs. In this study, we apply cultural analytics techniques to a collection of 3,389 issues of Time magazine, ranging from 1923 to 2014.\n\nIn order to grasp and analyze Time’s vast visual archive, we have used a combination of machine learning and human verification to identify large-scale visual trends, which we have supplemented with close readings of individual photographs and advertising images. This hybrid approach allows us to capture the magazine’s complexity at both the macro- and micro-levels. In this, we have been inspired by Arnold and Tilton’s distant viewing method. As they explain, the way a computer views images is characterized by a dual meaning of distance: distance from the way a human eye (and mind) understands visuality—for “computational methods “see” by calculating images as numbers”—and in terms of “scale,” or how “[t]hrough computer vision, interpretation of images can exceed a person’s physical ability to view and remember” (Arnold and Tilton 2023, 11–12). At the same time, distant viewing makes explicit how the computational interpretation of images is reliant upon human understanding. As Arnold and Tilton insist, “distance is not objective. Viewing makes explicit that the computational processing of images is shaped by ways of seeing and practices of looking and, therefore, by a set of social and cultural decisions … computer vision is a technology of communication shaped by people and imbued with cultural and social values” (Arnold and Tilton 2023, 12). We have found that Time is an ideal vehicle for this fruitful approach to visual culture.\n\nHas any object been photographed more often than the human face? Surely not. This is no accident, for no earthly object carries as much inherent human meaning as the face. This phenomenon has deep and universal physiological roots. As Simon Schama explains, the face is the first thing that newborns engage with. The relationship between one’s eyes and another’s face are, Schama argues, the “elementary social wiring” that anchors human cultures everywhere (Schama 2016, chap. 1, Kindle). It’s a relationship that can, however, be “rewired” in different contexts. Modern advertising, as historian Jackson Lears points out, is unthinkable without depictions of sincere human faces establishing trust between seller and buyer. Photographs of faces are also central to modern politics (Lears 1994, 60). For Roland Barthes, “the [political] candidate’s effigy establishes a personal link between electors and the candidate,” in which “not his projects but his motives … as well as mental characteristics” come to the fore as “an entire style of being of which he is simultaneously the product, the example, and the appeal” (Barthes 2012, 181). In the modern era, the facial image becomes a tool that erases politics as a “body of problems and solutions” in favour of personalized imagery (Barthes 2012, 181). Morgan Klaus Scheuerman, Madeleine Pape, and Alex Hanna draw our attention to the use of faces in colonial rule, in which facial features of the colonized were subjected to “practices of measurement and classification” that established racial and gender hierarchies, legitimizing colonialism as a political and economic project (Scheuerman, Pape, and Hanna 2021, 4). They also point out that this physiological-political strategy has been given distressing new life in our technologically driven twenty-first century in the form of “auto-essentialization,” in which “automated facial analysis projects … are reinscrib[ing] … the colonial order by reproducing—and automating—essentialized (and racialized) notions of gender/sex difference” (Scheuerman, Pape, and Hanna 2021, 8). Our attachment to human faces begins in innocence, but before long, it’s pulled this way and that by complex influences that are often far from innocent.\n\nTime magazine, from its inception in 1923, evinced a unique understanding of the political, commercial, and colonial (and post-colonial) power of the human face. Its first issue, for instance, featured an illustration of the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Joseph Cannon—a powerful politician presented in a manner that radiated dignity, eliding the more concrete machinations underlying Cannon’s political authority, in the terms Barthes outlined. Time also broke ground through its innovative mixture of commercial imperatives and political affairs. The two were, in fact, often difficult to pry apart in its pages. The magazine’s literary “house-style”—dubbed “Timestyle” by its critics—was a popular translation of the high-cultural prose its editor, Briton Hadden, and its publisher and editor-in-chief, Henry Luce, venerated at Yale College (now Yale University). They blended this with the rapidly developing practices of American advertising, both written and visual. For Hadden, and particularly Luce, serious journalism and commercial imperatives could be squared in Time, as a uniquely American, eminently modern magazine. Finally, Time had a marked global slant. This is in large part due to Luce’s often overbearing editorial influence. The child of Christian missionaries operating in China, he made sure that his magazine attended to the non-western world, as evidenced by Time’s international editions printed for overseas circulation. This was a sympathy he extended to racialized peoples in the United States—with important qualifications—in a way that made Time unique among American magazines.\n\nIn a recent peer-reviewed publication, we examined the representation of female faces in Time from the 1940s to the 1990s, supplementing our data with historically informed close-readings of the magazine’s visual and textual content. We found that the percentage of faces that present as female was closely aligned with larger currents in women’s history and the history of feminism (Jofre, Cole et al. 2020). More specifically, we found that the percentage of female facial images peaked as women became more active in public life and waned in eras characterized by anti-feminist backlash. We also noted a change in tone and content as Time, from the 1970s onwards, began hiring and promoting more women as writers, photographers, and editors (Prendergast and Colvin 1986).\n\nIn this paper, we expand upon this approach, examining a wider range of attributes over a longer period of time. In total, we analyzed 8,789 faces from a sample of 100 issues of Time, labelled with characteristics including gender, race, age, and context (advertisement or news feature). We found that the overall percentage of smiling faces increased significantly from 1923 until approximately 1940, after which it remained relatively constant through the rest of our dataset. Not surprisingly, the majority of faces found in advertisements are smiling. Looking at gender, we find that women’s faces are more likely to be found in advertisements than in news features, and women’s faces are more likely to be smiling in both news and advertising contexts. We break down the faces by racial categories and find that by the 1960s, the percentage of African American and Asian American faces increased markedly, due to Time’s engagement with key historical events of the era, particularly the Civil Rights Movement and the U.S. War in Vietnam—events that Time’s leadership was keen to both reflect and influence.\n\nResults\n\nUnsurprisingly, we found that most of the faces depicted in Time magazine were identified as white. Because this data only samples about 1 to 2 issues per year, and because the representation of non-white people has been so low, we do not have enough instances to break down the race data into other categories, such as gender or context, in a statistically significant way. Therefore, the analysis that follows in Figure 9 and in the next two sections limits itself to examining trends in the overall representation of race categories.\n\nAsian faces\n\nThe average percentage of Asian faces peaks around 1970. This coincides with the zenith of the US war in Vietnam.\n\nHenry Luce—who by mid-century had begun to see his magazines as political vehicles—made his sense of mission plain in his famous 1941 speech, “The American Century.” In it, he proclaimed: “the fundamental trouble with America has been, and is, that whereas their nation became in the 20th Century the most powerful and the most vital nation in the world, nevertheless Americans were unable to accommodate themselves spiritually and practically to that fact.” Luce went on to insist that the United States has “failed to play [its] part as a world power—a failure which has had disastrous consequences for themselves and for all mankind” (Luce 1999, 165). The “cure”—in Luce’s words—was this: “to accept wholeheartedly our duty and our opportunity as the most powerful and vital nation in the world and in consequence to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence, for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit” (Luce 1999, 165). From this point forward, Luce did all he could to make sure the journalists in his employ shared in his new, interventionist worldview.\n\nTime Inc., with Time magazine as its flagship publication, quickly took up arms in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Luce’s particular concern was the development of a hard line on Asian communism in India, Burma (now Myanmar), China, and Vietnam—one he shared with other powerful, elite Americans, as historian David Ekbladh has noted (Ekbladh 2010, Intro., Kindle). Luce was so resolute that he shifted Time Inc.’s long-standing allegiance from the Republicans to John F. Kennedy’s Democratic Party by the early-1960s due to the latter’s tougher stance on communism (Brinkley 2010, 424).\n\nThis did not mean that Time’s journalists simply fell in line, particularly on the issue of America’s war in Vietnam—a event that completely upended “common [American] values and goals, cutting across color, age, gender, religion and class” lines (Ishizuka 2018, 221). While Luce sought to make his magazines—Time above all—into “ideologically reliable vehicles” for the fight against the Southeast Asian insurgents, he met both direct and indirect resistance to these demands from writers, photographers, and editors (Brinkley 2010, 287). In one notable battle, one of Time’s most influential editors, Luce ally Otto Fuerbringer, insisted in 1962 that Time’s press section write a piece attacking American journalists reporting out of Saigon, including those from Time, for supposedly working against American interests. The resulting article claimed that these reporters were misrepresenting the war effort to boost their personal and professional status, and that this led them to be “severely critical of practically everything” (Brinkley, 2010, 447–448). Only after some of Time’s most prominent journalists threatened to quit, and a retraction was issued, did the issue die down. By that point, Time’s newsroom, alongside most mainstream news outlets, had shifted decidedly towards a more critical stance on the war. Luce himself left his position as editor-in-chief in 1964 (Brinkley 2010, 448).\n\nWe observe in our data, shown in Figure 10, that the representation of faces identified as Asian peaks around the time of the U.S. war in Vietnam. By 1965, Time’s cover—its “most valuable piece of real estate”—was occupied by none other than the leader of the Viet Cong, Ho Chi Min (Spiker 2018, 377). This visual trend in Time abates with the end of the war in 1975.\n\nAfrican American faces\n\nIn the case of the Vietnam War, Time’s most powerful editors had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, towards a left-leaning stance. Not so with the other major issue of the era: Civil Rights. Time stood apart from other major American publications in its long-standing support for African American social and economic struggles. The magazine covered lynchings from the 1920s onwards, with no less than 455 articles published on the topic between 1923 and 1960. Life, another major Time Inc. publication, devoted much of its October 3, 1938, issue to an article entitled “Negroes: The U.S. Also Has a Minority Problem,” which included a groundbreaking sequence of photos depicting the grim reality of African American life in the South, which made white supremacy palpable for many who had never seen such imagery. There was another, deeper message embedded in these photographic representations—one that spanned all of Time Inc.’s publications—that the degradation of African Americans equalled the degradation of America itself. White supremacy was, according to Life, a “glaring refutation of the American fetish that all men are created free and equal” (Brinkley 2010, 234).\n\nBy the 1950s, Time Inc. was openly supporting desegregation, with Time magazine at the forefront of this effort. The magazine extensively covered the 1956 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision that made racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. In addition to this, Time—still tied to the Republicans at this point—threw its considerable cultural weight behind President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s 1957 decision to send federal troops to Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce the Brown decision. Time devoted most of its October 7, 1957, issue to the event, denouncing segregationists in uncharacteristically caustic terms: “An old man turned his dry, grassfire eyes on Central High School, worked his bare gums in pleasure over the time ‘we burned a n***** in ‘27’”; “A fat ex-schoolteacher named Arthur Bickle looked around at the crowd’s hooligans, and chortled his satisfaction” (TIME 1957). In words and especially photographs, Time stood in stark contrast to other publications, “from Paris to Tokyo,” which reported on Little Rock with “undisguised disgust” at what they took to be Black-led mob violence (Booker and Booker 2013, 120). Between 1955 and 1965, Time published over one thousand articles on the civil rights movement, far outpacing any comparable journalistic outlet.\n\nImportantly, we must not conclude that Time was a radical publication, despite its support for African American human and civil rights. It remained resolutely in the centre of American political life, oscillating (slightly) right or (slightly) left, but always bounded by what it considered “the essential unity and the shared values of the American people” (Brinkley 2010, 134). Time’s politics were, in the end, a politics of liberal consensus (Brinkley 2010, 310–311). While it anointed Martin Luther King, Jr. as Man of the Year in 1963, by the mid-1960s, it revealed a deep discomfort with what it considered the “extremism” of some civil rights activists (Brinkley 2010, 421). For instance, Time’s coverage of the race riots in the late-1960s was distinctly unsympathetic. Its 1967 cover story on the Newark riot focused on the violence wrought and the property damage incurred, downplaying the racial injustice that lay at the heart of that violence. Police brutality in the Newark riot was deemphasized in statements such as “The very triviality of the riot’s immediate cause made the Newark outburst particularly terrifying” (TIME 1967). Time abhorred anti-black racism, as long as it didn’t violate what it considered the tenants of the American social contract. We also note that the demographic make-up of the writers and editors at Time magazine began to change in the 1970s, leading to more nuanced perspectives on these issues (Prendergast and Colvin 1986).\n\nAs shown in Figure 11, our data tracks with this historical picture as the percentage of faces identified as Black increased steadily throughout the twentieth century before plateauing at an average of about 11% starting in about 1999. According to the 2010 census, 13% of the American population identifies as African American, which means Time’s pages now more accurately represent—at least visually—the racial makeup of the country, a fact we attribute to larger public shifts in attitudes towards race, of which Time can be considered an important marker (United States Census Bureau 2010).\n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough we’ve shown that a distant view of images in Time magazine tracks well with cultural trends, we warn against reaching conclusions through metadata analysis alone, as contextualization is key to understanding the trends we observe. Our approach combines analytic methods with humanistic contextualization and a close reading of our source. We show that the context and history of Time magazine helps to elucidate discernable patterns in aggregated data.\n\nIn summary, we found that smiling becomes on average more prevalent after the 1930s due to changes in attitude toward photography and to changes in the culture of advertising. Faces that are in the context of advertising are more likely to be smiling than faces in other contexts, which is consistent with a culture of advertising that depicts happy alternate realities in order to sell goods and services. Women are more likely to appear in ads than men, which is consistent with the sexist tropes of twentieth-century advertisement. Yet sexist tropes persist beyond advertisements, as we find that women are more likely to be smiling in all contexts, including news features. Turning to the data on representation of racialized faces, we find that the number of Asian faces peaks around 1970, coincident with the pinnacle of Vietnam war coverage, and that the number of African American faces increases steadily throughout the twentieth century, reaching something close to proportional representation around the turn of the century, which is consistent with Time’s evolution towards inclusivity as an institution and in its editorial perspective.\n\nThere are yet more connections to be drawn from this data. We have observed, for example, that the proportion of children increases sharply after 1990, and we intend to examine this trend more closely as it coincides with an increase in visibility of children in the public sphere. The human-sourced data presented in this paper can be used to train an algorithm to classify all 327,322 faces extracted from our archive, resulting in a more detailed data set to be examined.\n\nAnother important objective of this project is to use our image collection to create an interactive web resource to disseminate our research and findings to the general public, with the goal of encouraging people to explore, contextualize, and understand their own cultural and visual histories.
