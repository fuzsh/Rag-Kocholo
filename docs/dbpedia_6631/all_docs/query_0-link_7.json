        "text": "Time is a weekly news magazine which has been published since 1923. Covering events in American politics, world news, and entertainment, the Muppets have been featured in several articles over the years. During the run of The Muppet Show, the magazine's \"People\" section often had brief blurbs on the show's guest stars and their relationship with the Muppets, and resident critic Richard Corliss reviewed most of the films, including a comment that The Dark Crystal was Jim Henson's bleak \"foray into the art, dammit, of puppetry.\"\n\nNotable Appearances[]\n\nSep. 14, 1970: \"Bath Time for Ernie.\" Article on the unexpected success of Columbia Records' single recording of \"Rubber Duckie,\" selling 700,000 copies.\n\nNovember 23, 1970: \"Who's Afraid of Big Bad TV?\" (cover story).

The former is a close analysis of The Muppet Show, the character dynamics, relationships, and popularity. The latter is a profile of Jim Henson. The cover was to have featured but instead featured news of Jimmy Carter's diplomatic breakthrough with China.[1]\n\nDecember 30, 1985: \" People\"- Brief piece on Miss Piggy to promote The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years, and including a quote by Piggy regarding her age: \"By no stretch of the imagination am I anywhere near the age of 30,\" she snorts. \"I fell in love with a much older frog. I consider the matter closed.\"\n\nJune 8, 1998: \"The TV Creator,\" an in-depth tribute to Jim Henson, selected as part of the special Time 100 issue and acclaimed as the \"Most Influential TV Creator.\"\n\nJune 20, 2011: \"Comeback Kids: A visit to the set of the new Muppets film\" by Joel Stein\n\nAugust 13, 2014: Kermit and Pepe appear in a video interview to promote Muppets Most Wanted.\n\nReferences[]\n\nIn The Miss Piggy Cover Girl Fantasy Calendar, Miss Piggy spoofs the magazine with a cover titled \"Bringing Home the Bacon\".\n\nA marked-up copy of the June 8, 1981 edition of Time can be seen prominently in the Hooper's Store newsstand in Episode 1961 of Sesame Street.\n\nIn the Sesame Street storybook I Want to Be President, Betty Lou imagines herself on the cover of \"Times Now.\"\n\nA copy of Time can be seen in the Newsman's makeshift newsroom, a news stand at a railroad station, in episode 308 of The Muppet Show.\n\nIn March 2014, Constantine \"infiltrated\" the Facebook offices in order to promote his Badfrog website, during which he held up a Time magazine cover of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg with an added mole, and the caption: \"With mole on his face, donâ€™t I look exactly like Mark Zuckerberg? Maybe next time I take his place! #BadFrog\"\n\nSources[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nTIME for Kids"
