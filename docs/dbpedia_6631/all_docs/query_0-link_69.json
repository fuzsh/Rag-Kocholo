        "text": "The Atlantic, New York and The New York Times Magazine win multiple awards; The New Yorker tops winners of ASME Awards for Design, Photography and Illustration\n\nNEW YORK (April 2, 2024)—The American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) tonight announced the winners of the 2024 National Magazine Awards. The winners were named during the 59th annual awards presentation at Terminal 5 in New York City. The winners of the ASME Award for Fiction, the ASME Awards for Design, Photography and Illustration and the ASME NEXT Awards for Journalists Under 30 were also honored.\n\nOne of the most prestigious journalism-awards programs in the United States, the National Magazine Awards are sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Editors in association with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Originally limited to print magazines, the awards now recognize magazine storytelling published in any print or digital medium. The awards are currently presented in 17 categories.\n\nThe 2024 presentation of the National Magazine Awards was sponsored by Hearst Magazines and Rosaluna Mezcal.\n\n“The winners speak for themselves,” said Sidney Holt, the executive director of ASME. “Not only is each an outstanding example of magazine storytelling—and in the case of the General Excellence winners, there are dozens of examples—but each also demonstrates the continuing vitality of print and digital media.”\n\nThe top National Magazine Award winners this year were The Atlantic with four awards, New York with two awards and The New York Times Magazine with three awards. The winners also included Business Insider, Highsnobiety, Invisible Institute with USG Audio, The Marshall Project, Philadelphia, ProPublica with The Texas Tribune, Rest of World and The Yale Review.\n\nThe ASME Award for Fiction was won by The Paris Review for the second consecutive year. The winners of the ASME Awards for Design, Photography and Illustration were led by The New Yorker with four awards. The ASME Awards for Design, Photography and Illustration winners also included The Atlantic, GQ, The Marshall Project, National Geographic, The New York Times Magazine and New York Times Opinion. The ASME NEXT Awards honorees were writers and creatives from The Hollywood Reporter, MIT Technology Review, New York, Variety and Vulture.\n\nThe Atlantic’s “Inside the Meltdown at CNN”—Tim Alberta’s profile of Chris Licht, which led to Licht’s ouster as network chief—was among the most notable stories to win National Magazine Awards this year. Jennifer Senior’s “The Ones We Sent Away,” about the life of her mentally disabled aunt, and three articles by Sophie Gilbert on the depiction of gender and power in the media also won awards for The Atlantic.\n\nThe winners included two deeply reported articles on school shootings: The New York Times Magazine’s “What Can’t Be Unseen,” about the crime-scene investigators who worked the Sandy Hook shooting, and ProPublica and The Texas Tribune’s “Someone Tell Me What to Do,” about law-enforcement failures at the Uvalde, Texas, shooting. New York’s “The War and New York,” received the National Magazine Award for Single-Topic Topic (New York won the same award last year for “Ten Years Since Trayvon”), and on the lighter side, Philadelphia’s “All Hail the Hoagie” won the award for Lifestyle Journalism.\n\nThe 2024 winners of the National Magazine Award for General Excellence were The Atlantic, in the News, Sports and Entertainment category; Highsnobiety in the Service and Lifestyle category; The Marshall Project in the Special Interest category; and The Yale Review in the Literature, Science and Politics category. The Atlantic and The Marshall Project were both repeat winners. The Marshall Project won General Excellence for the second consecutive year, while The Atlantic won General Excellence for the third consecutive year, a feat matched only by Outside in 1996, 1997 and 1998.\n\nFirst-time winners this year were Highsnobiety and The Yale Review in General Excellence, Business Insider in Video and Rest of World in Design.\n\nFor a complete list of the 2024 finalists, with links to stories, please visit asme.media.
