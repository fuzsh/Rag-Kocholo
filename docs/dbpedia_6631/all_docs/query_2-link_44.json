        "text": "We want our coverage of this campaign to help the world understand the candidates Interviewing political leaders has been a staple of TIME’s journalism for decades, as we report on the most influential people in the world and bring those insights to our readers. With six months to go until the U.S. presidential election, we want our coverage of this campaign to help the world and American voters understand what the candidates would do if elected. Today, Donald Trump is in a better position to win the White House than at any point in the previous two campaigns. TIME’s Eric Cortellessa, who covers the Trump campaign, interviewed the former President twice in April to hear from Trump himself what a second term would look like. Trump’s ongoing trial in Manhattan and his…\n\nThe gala celebrating TIME’s 2024 list of the most influential people took place on April 25 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City. Honorees included, clockwise from top: pop star Dua Lipa; Oscar nominee Colman Domingo; Emmy Award winner Maya Rudolph; NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes; (from left) Grammy Award–winning singer Kylie Minogue, Human Rights Campaign head Kelley Robinson, actor and singer Billy Porter; and actor Michael J. Fox. See the gala Sunday, May 12, at 10 p.m. E.T. on ABC, and later on Hulu.

From left: political analysts Van Jones and Michael Allen, TIME CEO Jessica Sibley, Office of Management and Budget director Shalanda Young, and TIME’s…\n\nAmerican campuses have not looked like this in more than 50 years, and never for the reasons they do now. The foreign war that students protested in the 1960s and ’70s was one that, even amid draft deferments, threatened their own lives. What has stirred students to risk their safety, enrollment, and future careers on hundreds of campuses this spring is the deaths of others—the 34,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched its retaliation for the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 and took 240 hostage. The protesters’ own point of reference is the 1980s campaign for divestment from apartheid South Africa. In their campaign, aimed at what they see as financial complicity in Israel’s actions, the activists—many swathed in kaffiyehs and living in tents, if they…\n\nIn November 2022, OpenAI released its wildly popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Six months later, leading AI researchers and industry executives signed a statement warning that “the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Lawmakers around the world took notice, and as substantial federal AI legislation began to seem possible, lobbyists flooded the Capitol. The number of groups lobbying the U.S. federal government on AI nearly tripled from 158 in 2022 to 451 in 2023, according to data from OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying. All organizations that carry out lobbying, the legal definition of which includes only directly discussing specific laws or regulations, are required to report how much they spent. However, this…\n\nINAUGURATED Vladimir Putin A fifth term for Russia’s leader In a lavish inauguration ceremony in the Grand Kremlin Palace’s Andreyevsky Hall, Vladimir Putin was sworn in on May 7 for a record-breaking fifth term as President of Russia. Putin took an oath of allegiance by placing his right hand on Russia’s constitution. The ceremony—widely boycotted by Western diplomats following what election watchdogs called a sham vote in March—marked the start of a new six-year presidential term. Putin claimed 87% of the vote in the three-day presidential election, having faced no credible opposition candidates. His most prominent opponent, Alexei Navalny, was found dead in an Arctic penal colony in February. Navalny’s wife, exiled opposition leader Yulia Navalnaya, called Putin “a liar, a thief, and a murderer” in a video shared on the day of his…\n\nIn the tidy backyard of Kate Cox’s Dallas-area home, there are two child-size lawn chairs alongside two toddler bicycles. There are two red-and-white stuffed horses in the playroom, and two sippy cups sitting in the sink. Everywhere you look, there are two of everything. The only problem is, there should be three. Last year, Cox and her husband Justin were thrilled to learn that she was pregnant again. They had always planned to have a large family—three, maybe even four kids. When Cox saw the positive pregnancy test in August, she ran into the playroom to tell Justin, who was wrestling on the floor with their 3-year-old daughter and 18-month-old son. Justin immediately started considering whether they would need a bigger car; Kate was just excited. But a few more weeks into…"
