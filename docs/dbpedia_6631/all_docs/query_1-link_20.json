        "text": "This is a list of people and other topics appearing on the cover of Time magazine in the 1960s. Time was first published in 1923. As Time became established as one of the United States' leading news magazines, an appearance on the cover of Time became an indicator of notability, fame or notoriety. Such features were accompanied by articles.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1969, all of the dates had been issued on Friday instead of Monday scheduled time frame.\n\nFor other decades, see Lists of covers of Time magazine.\n\nTime cover search\n\nTime The Vault"
