        "text": "TIME Magazine named Taylor Swift as Person of the Year and people online are reacting with mixed emotions.\n\nThere were nine candidates up for the running which included the Hollywood strikers, Xi Jinping, Taylor Swift, Sam Altman, Trump prosecutors, Barbie, Valdimir Putin, King Charles III and Jerome Powel.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, it was revealed Taylor Swift was awarded the coveted title.\n\n“For building a world of her own that made a place for so many, for spinning her story into a global legend, for bringing joy to a society desperately in need of it, Taylor Swift is TIME’s Person of the Year,” Editor-in-chief of TIME, Sam Jacobs, said in a statement.\n\nPeople on X reacted with one user saying, “TIME giving Taylor Swift “person of the year” as if Beyoncé wasn’t right there.”\n\nAnother person said, “Taylor Swift as Person of the Year with Putin and Xi Jinping as her competitors, don’t know whether to laugh or cry…”\n\nBut not all the reactions are bad because the ‘Swifties’ swiftly swifted in!\n\nOne X user said, “TAYLOR SWIFT PERSON OF THE YEAR LIKE SHE DESERVES.”\n\nAnother said, “TAYLOR SWIFT PERSON OF THE YEAR I KNOW THAT’S RIGHT!!! THAT’S MY GIRL!!!”\n\nBack in 2017, Swift was recognized as one of the Silence Breakers in the #MeToo movement inspiring women to come forward with their stories of sexual misconduct, TIME noted.\n\nThe pop artist has now appeared twice on a Person of the Year cover which makes her the first woman to appear twice since the franchise began in 1927, the article added."
