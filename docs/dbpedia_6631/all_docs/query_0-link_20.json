The fall, in comparison, felt brutally fast. Just weeks after a disastrous debate spurred a dramatic revolt within his own party, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the 46th President of the United States, caved on July 21 to concerns among Democrats about his dwindling re-election chances, dropping out of the contest against former President Donald Trump. The dramatic decision upends the 2024 race and sets the stage for a frantic scramble to Election Day. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden wrote in a letter posted on social media a little before 2 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon. “While it…\n\nThe wedding celebrations for the son of Asia’s richest man culminated in a lavish, celebrity-filled three-day gathering that came to a close in Mumbai on July 14. Mukesh Ambani, chairman of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, hosted festivities over seven months for his son Anant Ambani’s marriage to pharmaceutical heiress Radhika Merchant. STAR-STUDDED Decked out in glamorous Indian attire, guests included global power players from across the entertainment industry, business world, and political elite. The nuptials are estimated to have cost nearly $600 million and guests included celebrities Kim Kardashian, John Cena, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and Nick Jonas. Former British Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Tony Blair, as well as India’s leader Narendra Modi, were also in attendance. Pre-wedding events attended by Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner…\n\nI’ve spent my whole life happily walking in one direction: forward. It was, I believed, the only way to go, so I dutifully logged dozens of miles a month looking like every other person out for a morning stroll. No more. Thanks to TikTok, I discovered a new (to me, at least) spin on walking: backward walking, also known as retro-walking. Though it’s trending on social media platforms right now, physical therapists and fitness trainers have been touting its benefits for years. It’s a low-impact way to burn calories, strengthen your legs, test your coordination, become more flexible, and even reduce pain, experts say—all of which lured me onto my quiet rural street one afternoon to give it a whirl. After about 50 steps, I realized going in reverse was no walk…\n\nHours before India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed in Moscow on July 8, Russia fired missiles on Ukraine that killed at least 41 people, including four children at a children’s hospital in Kyiv. Condemnations were still arriving from around the globe as Modi smiled and posed for photos with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During Modi’s two-day visit to the Kremlin—his first trip to Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022—the two leaders hugged each other outside Putin’s residence before holding informal talks. Putin told Modi he was “very happy” to see his “dear friend,” according to Russia’s TASS state news agency, while Modi called the visit a “wonderful opportunity to deepen ties” between the two countries in a post on the social media platform X. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr…\n\nDIED Shelley Duvall Offbeat ingenue Shelley Duvall swept onto film screens of the ’70s and ’80s, having had no previous acting experience when director Robert Altman cast her in six consecutive movies. Best known for starring in The Shining opposite Jack Nicholson, Duvall died July 11 at 75. DIED Richard Simmons Mover and shaker Magnetic exercise revolutionary Richard Simmons died July 13 at 76. With his radically upbeat and accepting workout approach, Simmons aerobicized his way into viewers’ hearts during his show and beyond—tank top, shorts, and all. DIED Dr. Ruth Westheimer Beloved sex adviser On a first-name basis with the country, Dr. Ruth gave frank answers to intimacy questions, catapulting to fame and radio syndication as America’s sex therapist. Westheimer, who wrote 45 books about sexuality, died July 13 at 96. DIED Shannen Doherty The quintessential Gen X girl Shannen Doherty epitomized the experience…"
