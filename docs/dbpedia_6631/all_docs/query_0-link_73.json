        "text": "The Ultimate Birthday Book is like a time capsule that captures the headlines of one's life. Ever wonder what world events occurred on the day you were born? Or what events shaped your parents' lifetime? Only the immense daily record of The Times can inspire such rich and personalized reflection.\n\nThis hardbound compilation chronicles every birthday front page in someone's life. If the special date is Feb. 4, 1931, for example, this book would include the front page from that day, and the front page from Feb. 4 every year thereafter, right through today. As the recipient flips through the book, it will take them back to the most important headlines, articles and photos from the perspective of The Times.\n\nAn enhanced version of our 80-page Custom Birthday Book, the Ultimate offers additional features to make it a lasting treasure and an heirloom gift. It contains approximately 140 pages, including an entertaining 24-page timeline, packed with photos, of more than 1,200 news and cultural events spanning the last 120 years. The timeline is available nowhere else. The Ultimate also features four pages of newsworthy events from your chosen year and a collection of world-changing front pages.\n\nA Times exclusive, this \"year you were born book\" is available with a leatherette cover with foil-stamped embossing or with a luxurious linen cover. Both leatherette and linen versions come in an assortment of colors.\n\nThe book comes with a 2.5\" x 7.5\" magnifier and a certificate of authenticity.\n\nAvailable for the years 1915 to 2011. Books for younger recipients have fewer birthday front pages, but we automatically insert additional historical front pages to make each book substantial with around 140 pages.\n\nIf ordering for this year's birthday, be sure to order the day of the birthday or later to include this year's page. Due to the nature of this product, dates for February 29 are not available. For birthdays that fall on a leap year, we recommend our Special Day book as an alternative.\n\nPages are smaller than the dimensions of a newspaper, so the type is reduced slightly to fit this book’s 12” x 15” format. Pages after 1998 are in full color. Most pre-1998 pages are reproduced from microfilm, an archiving process that picked up imperfections on printed pages and diminished the quality of photos.\n\nBecause this personalized item is custom-made for you, all sales are final and this product cannot be returned, refunded or exchanged. Produced in Vermont.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Light Gray\n\nMaterial: Linen cover with premium stock paper, gold bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Charcoal Gray\n\nMaterial: Linen cover with premium stock paper, gold bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Navy Blue\n\nMaterial: Linen cover with premium stock paper, gold bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Azure Blue\n\nMaterial: Linen cover with premium stock paper, gold bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Sage Green\n\nMaterial: Linen cover with premium stock paper, gold bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Red\n\nMaterial: Linen cover with premium stock paper, gold bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Sand\n\nMaterial: Linen cover with premium stock paper, gold bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Slate Gray\n\nMaterial: Leatherette cover with premium stock paper, silver bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth.\n\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nDimensions: 15\" x 12.5\"\n\nColor: Black\n\nMaterial: Leatherette cover with premium stock paper, silver bookmarker and magnifier.\n\nCare Instructions: Dust gently with a dry cloth."
