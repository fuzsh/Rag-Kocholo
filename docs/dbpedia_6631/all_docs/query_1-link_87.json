        "text": "From July 19 to 22, I attended America in One Room: The Youth Vote, a Washington, D.C., gathering of 500 first-time voters discussing policy issues. The voters constituted a representative sample of young Americans from diverse backgrounds, all ages 17 and 18. Throughout the weekend, participants read through relevant policy proposals, deliberated in small groups, heard from expert panels and completed surveys on their views as part of a deliberative polling experiment.\n\nI sat in on the healthcare deliberation and panel, as a young, uninvolved observer with an interest in reproductive health—also about to vote in my first presidential election. Here are my five main takeaways.\n\n1. Young Americans care deeply about healthcare.\n\nThrough listening to their deliberations, questions to experts and individual interviews with Ms., it was clear that the healthcare discussion resonated with students, which tackled issues like abortion and contraception, the Affordable Care Act and mental health. They were passionate about the American healthcare system and connected to issues on a personal level, sharing stories of their communities and identities being impacted by policy decisions.\n\nWhen asked what issues they were most interested in—deliberations centered on the environment, economy and workforce, healthcare and democracy and elections—students spoke about “reinstating abortion rights nationwide and giving more attention and funding to mental health,” as shared by Emily Criswell, an America in One Room participant.\n\n“The conversation on abortion is a conversation on bodily autonomy, and wherever that conversation is being had, women need to be in the room. We need to be protecting fundamental access to healthcare, especially for women and people who have children,” said Ysabella Olsen, another participant.\n\n2. Abortion was uncomfortable for voters to talk about—at first.\n\nAlthough abortion was included as a healthcare issue, it evoked a particular sense of discomfort not present during discussions on other medical procedures. The deliberation was marked by nervous laughter and a student who changed the subject from abortion and contraception to social media before all proposals were discussed. A female participant later redirected the conversation back towards abortion.\n\n“As we talk about reproductive healthcare in general and this false distinction between abortion, miscarriage and obstetric emergencies, and we increase understanding of women’s health, their bodies and what happens during pregnancy, there is a reduction in stigma and a connection that happens across different viewpoints,” Rebecca Reingold, healthcare panel expert and associate director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, told Ms.\n\n3. Discussions between the students went (surprisingly) well.\n\nWhile the issues they deliberated were sometimes divisive, participants engaged civilly. And despite the gendered expectations of who dominates discussions—“they had a lot to say … as a lot of men do,” said one student of the males in her group—participants of all genders eventually expressed positive sentiments about abortion during deliberation. They felt respected and encouraged to share their opinions, even when their stances conflicted with others.\n\n“Seeing the panel, sometimes they got contested. When we’d go back to our deliberation rooms, we were calmer, we were more empathetic toward each other, we generally cared a lot more about each other’s opinions,” said Chardon Black, one of the participants.\n\n4. Young people are wary of the American political system.\n\nThe morning after Biden stepped down, students shared feelings of “reluctance,” “shame” and “fear and disappointment” towards voting in their first election. They were frustrated with the polarization and lack of representation within leaders. However, this did not stop their political involvement; it motivated their participation. Students were driven by the issues they cared about and actively sought out opportunities to engage in conversations and work towards their political goals.\n\nIn the weeks following the nominee switch, the Harris campaign has garnered joy and enthusiasm amongst youth. “In this election, fundamental rights for women are on the line,” said Olsen. “I do feel excited because I know we will have a ticket that supports reproductive rights for women and maybe even a ticket that is looking at the Equal Rights Amendment.”\n\nThis momentum may translate to higher turnout among young voters.\n\n5. Reproductive justice provides a framework geared towards youth.\n\nEmbracing reproductive justice is a tactical move in the fight to protect reproductive health. It should be reflected in policy discussions, as young people tend to care about an array of different issues.\n\n“Within this generation, there is an ability to see how issues come together and how it is important to be aware and engaged on all of them,” said Reingold. “Over time we’ve seen young people be very involved in the reproductive justice movement. It has been a place for people to connect with a broader vision of what they want the world to be.”\n\nUp next:"
