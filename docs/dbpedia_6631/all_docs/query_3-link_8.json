        "text": "NOTE: The absolutely essential things to evaluate are a source's claim, authority, and bias. If you can establish that these are solid, then the source is credible. However, we can seldom be completely sure of our evaluation, so looking at the publication type provides clues about authority and bias.\n\nInformation comes in various \"packages\" (or publication types):\n\nPrinted books\n\nNewspapers\n\nOnline blog entries\n\nScholarly journals\n\nEtc.\n\nDifferent publication types have different characteristics. These give us clues to the credibility of the information they contain.\n\nOne publication type, the Scholarly journal, has a well known quality control system, known as the peer review process.\n\nWhat is peer review?\n\nExpert researchers in an academic discipline, such as medicine or sociology, report their research findings in scholarly journals. Over time, the articles published in a journal form a serious written conversation among the experts. To ensure quality, many scholarly journals require peer review of articles before they are published. A peer reviewer is simply another expert in the same academic field or discipline as the author. Prior to publication, the reviewer looks at the article's significance, method, and possible bias. Articles that don't meet the standards are not published. Many articles are published only after revisions. This \"hurdle\" is a form of quality control that we all benefit from.\n\nAt well-known journals, many authors compete for a limited number of publication slots, and this also serves to increase quality."
