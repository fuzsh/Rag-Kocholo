        "text": "Journals, magazines, and newspapers are all types of periodicals (publications that are published periodically, or in a serial fashion.)\n\nPeriodicals include daily newspapers, weekly news magazines, monthly popular interest magazines, trade publications, and academic journals, which may be published only a few times each year. A publication of a periodical is usually called an \"issue.\" Those are organized into volumes (sometimes bound, print volumes that libraries still have!). Different types of periodicals have different purposes and features, which influences their articles.\n\nIn general, to tell the difference between each the three most common articles types, you must note the audience, purpose, and publication process:\n\nA journal article:\n\nAudience: Journal articles are written by experts, for experts.\n\nPurpose: These articles usually contain coverage of or present recent research/scholarship on a specific area. Many journals are scholarly. They are sometimes known as \"Academic Journals.\" Some publish peer reviewed articles as part of their publication process. Learn how to find scholarly articles here.\n\nPublication Process: They may be published in print or online formats--or both. These types of articles are published according to a set schedule throughout the year (monthly, quarterly, etc.), but not as frequently as newspapers or magazines. They may or may not be peer reviewed before publication (see this FAQ on how to tell). Journals with fully-documented references are more scholarly than those that do not include a bibliography or a list of references. Published by academic or professional organizations.\n\nExample: HTS Teologiese Studies: \"Christianity in Africa: The cost of loyalty to Zionism\"\n\nA magazine article: These article types may be appropriate to use in an academic paper depending on your topic, focus, and assignment requirements. Magazines can be useful for introductory reading about your topic or for collecting fast facts.\n\nAudience: Magazine articles are usually intended for the general public or a demographic.\n\nPurpose: They aim to entertain, inform, or educate a general audience on a wide range of topics, including current events, lifestyle, culture, fashion, health, and more.\n\nPublication Process: Magazine articles are typically shorter and more accessible than journal articles, often written in a journalistic style. They may include personal stories, interviews, and opinions alongside factual information. Published on a regular basis (weekly, monthly) by commercial publishers. They may be published in print or online formats--or both.\n\nExamples: Teen Vogue: \"Ireland Recognized Palestinian Statehood. Here’s How Deep Their Solidarity Goes.\"\n\nA newspaper article: These article types may be appropriate to use in an academic paper depending on your topic, focus, and assignment requirements. The articles in newspapers provide a journalistic perspective on a specific time and place. Reliable news stories are based on eye-witness' perceptions of what happened.\n\nAudience: Intended for the general public, readers interested in staying informed about local, national, and international news.\n\nPurpose: Newspaper articles provide timely news coverage, editorials, opinion pieces, and investigative reports on current events and issues.\n\nPublication Process: Articles are usually shorter and deal with daily news topics. Most newspapers come out daily and are published by news organizations. They may be published in print or online formats--or both.\n\nExample: New York Times: \"Amid Outcry, Academy Museum to Revise Exhibit on Hollywood’s Jewish Roots\"\n\nThe video and links below will help you learn more about their differences."
