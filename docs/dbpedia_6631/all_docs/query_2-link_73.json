        "text": "Blackfinch is proud to share the news that Tended, one of our VCT and EIS portfolio companies, was named in Time Magazineâs prestigious list of Best Inventions for 2023.\n\nBased in Lincoln and founded in 2017, Tended designs intelligent and affordable personal safety wearables and monitoring systems. These wearables combine âgeofencingâ technology with behavioural science to ensure on-site workers are kept out of harmâs way. The device uses centimetre level accuracy to prevent workers straying into pre-defined danger zones, helping to prevent accidents. Tendedâs CEO and founder Leo Scott Smith was inspired to build the company after he helped deliver aid relief in Nepal following its 2015 earthquake.\n\nTended experienced notable success during the pandemic after developing a reliable social distancing product, which attracted customers such as Rolls Royce and Unilever. It now focuses on improving the safety of workers across multiple industries including construction, manufacturing, utilities and especially rail, by using its high-accuracy positioning hardware. Tended already counts industry leaders as its customers, including Siemens and Network Rail, and recently signed a contract with the European Space Agency to advance its capabilities to deliver âthe next generation of geospatial technologyâ.\n\nThe passion, drive and growth potential of the Tended team was evident when they pitched to us for the first time, and we have continued to invest as the company has grown. Tended is also a great example of a UK success story that doesnât have to be situated in London or the South East to be successful.\n\nSpeaking about the accolade, Leo Scott-Smith said: âWe are honoured to have been included in TIME's prestigious list of Best Inventions for 2023. This acknowledgement highlights the importance of our technology in the rail sector and the workers we aim to protect. It's an accolade that belongs to the whole team at Tended who are dedicated to developing game-changing technology that will transform safety and efficiency within the rail industry.â\n\nThis is not the only recognition for excellence Tended has earned this year. It also achieved a place on the Digital Leaders 100 list for Geospatial Initiative of the Year 2023 and was a winner in the Innovation of the Year category at the 2023 National Rail Awards."
