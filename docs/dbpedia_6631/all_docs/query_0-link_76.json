        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Is the year of Taylor Swift over now? Not yet.\n\nTime magazine named Swift its person of the year on Wednesday, a week after Spotify announced she was the most-played artist on the streaming platform.\n\nSwift was picked from a group of nine finalists that included Barbie, King Charles III, and OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, among others.\n\n“While her popularity has grown across the decades, this is the year that Swift, 33, achieved a kind of nuclear fusion: shooting art and commerce together to release an energy of historic force,” Time said about her selection.\n\nHer year included the wildly popular Eras Tour and concert movie, the release of her reimagined ‘1989′ album, and her closely watched relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. She’s even the subject of college courses."
