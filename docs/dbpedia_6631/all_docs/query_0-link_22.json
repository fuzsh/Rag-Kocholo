        "text": "After returning to the upper echelons of popular music in 2023, Kylie Minogue is ready to bask in her achievement as one of the most influential people in the world.\n\nOn Wednesday (April 17), TIME announced its annual list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Along with music peers such as Dua Lipa, 21 Savage, Burna Boy and Jack Antonoff, the “Padam Padam” singer earned a spot on the coveted list, falling under the “Icons” category.\n\nTo tribute Minogue, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin wrote her entry for the annual ranking, praising Minogue for her unwavering support throughout his career. “Kylie Minogue was one of the first people I ever met from TV,” Martin wrote. “She was a pop star, and I had watched her in Neighbours every day for a decade. So when she came to an early Coldplay show, I’d already been her fan for nearly 15 years.”\n\nMartin continued, praising Minogue’s commitment to reinvention throughout her decades-long career. “She lives her life so gracefully and approaches every project with such passion and dedication. She always seems to be 10 years ahead of everyone else, and she’s an artist who knows how to be of service, making songs that fans go on to love for years,” he explained. “Kylie creates a space where everyone is safe to be themselves. When I look at her I feel hope. She’s proof there are humans who don’t judge.”\n\nTaking to her Instagram, Minogue thanked TIME for honoring her and expressed her surprise at being included on the list. “Thank you for this incredible honour, being amongst such stellar company,” she wrote. “This is mind-blowing to me and is making my heart FULLY Padam!!”"
