        "text": "Then, in one of the more unusual career shifts in media, Grossman left Time early this year to take on a new role as president of enterprise at crypto payments unicorn MoonPay.\n\nFortune’s Ukraine-based contributor Anna Tutova spoke with Grossman about his experience leading Time into NFTs, and about his new role at MoonPay, where his mission is to bring as many people as possible into the Web3 space.\n\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The final four answers were supplied by email.)\n\nWhen did you first become interested in crypto and NFTs?\n\nMy career started at Wired, which covered technology and specifically the emergence of cryptocurrencies. This has been a space I have been familiar with for years and that I personally enjoy. However, it was not until 2020 that I came across NFT technologies. I was in upstate New York. I was alone, isolated, and realized for the first time that my digital identity was just as valuable as my physical identity.\n\nThus, when I came across NFT technologies, it made sense that if my two identities were equal, if I wanted to own things in the physical world, I might also want to own things in the digital world. In March 2021, we brought Time into Web3 with 1:1 collectibles. In September 2021, we launched TIMEPieces.\n\nSo you have a collector’s mindset. Do you like collecting traditional art as well?\n\nYes! I love art. I love tech. I love media. I love business. Therefore this was a perfect space for me. As somebody who loves art, I do collect a lot, especially photography NFTs.\n\nWhat are your favorite NFTs?\n\nI have so many. If you look at TIMEPieces, TIME’s community-based initiative, what started out with 38 artists is now 150-plus. Most are artists I absolutely love: Cath Simard, Victor Mosquera, Fvckrender, Justin Aversano, Diana Sinclair, John Knopf. I could go on and on, but it’s just an amazing group of artists.\n\nWhat was the first NFT you owned?\n\nMy first NFT was a clock that said 11:11. It was a good luck clock, and I loved that. I have it framed, and it sits next to my computer at home and just means the world to me. I just look at it every day, and I think about that quite a bit.\n\nDo you have any trendy NFTs like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks?\n\nNo, I don’t have any Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks. I have The Day I Decided to Fly. I have a few ThankYouXs. I have a few Dave Krugman and JN Silva NFTs.\n\nHow did TIMEPieces get started? Did you make the decision to take Time into NFTs? Did you have to get approval from the board of directors?\n\nWe took Time into Web3 in March of 2021. It was me, our legal team, and our creative director, and we had a lot of success with that. Within a month, we’d accepted 34 different cryptocurrencies for digital subscriptions of Time. I spent the following months in Clubhouse just listening and learning. This is how TIMEPieces came about: from conversations with people like ThankYouX, Dave Krugman, and JN Silva. They showed me the power of blockchain technology.\n\nIronically, I did not have to seek any approval for funding because we had done so much business on SuperRare that when they converted to a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization], we converted our $RARE to $ETH and that ultimately funded the launch of TIMEPieces. It is an incredible Web3 story!\n\nHow many of your subscribers pay for the subscription in crypto?\n\nNot that many. A few thousand. This was more of a validator of the space than anything else. You have to remember: Time reaches 100 million consumers a month, and we have millions of subscribers. Over 15,000 wallets hold over 30,000 TIMEPieces, and nearly 10,000 of those wallets connected to Time.com to remove its paywall. That is the equivalent of a digital subscription! For the Web3 community, the subscription was secondary to the access and exclusivity of being part of the community.\n\nDid you see growth in your readership after launching TIMEPieces NFTs?\n\nTIMEPieces opened the readership to a whole new community of passionate, engaged individuals.\n\nWhere do you see value in NFTs? From the mindset of a collector? Or is it more from belonging to a certain club?\n\nI think it depends on what your intention is: Some people love the space from the mindset of a collector. That was my initial realization about Time—that it was a 100-year-old analog meme creator with its iconic covers. Some people love the space for its ability to create community. That is what TIMEPieces is: a community of shared psychographics—not demographics or geographics. And some people love the technology itself and how the technology can be used for subscriptions and memberships and loyalty programs.\n\nI want to thank you for your support of Ukraine. You showed me the NFT collection you launched for Ukraine—can you tell me more about it?\n\nOf course! I have tremendous admiration for Nadya from Pussy Riot and think she is the best example of someone who uses the technology for good. You saw it with UkraineDAO where she secured close to $10 million to support people in need. Then you saw RELI8F raise a million dollars in 30 seconds. Given that TIMEPieces was a values-based community, we believed we should do something, too.\n\nSo we approached 61 TIMEPieces artists on a Friday evening and by Sunday got 1:1 pieces from each of them to launch an initiative titled Artists for Peace. Within 48 hours we raised nearly $400K, which went to humanitarian aid in Ukraine. The notion of “warm crypto”—using the technology for good—is really important, in my opinion.\n\nNFT trading and prices have dropped a lot. The trading volume of OpenSea dropped 99%. So where do you think this industry is headed?\n\nTIMEPieces was not built around prices or trading, and we said that from the very beginning. We always stressed that we were a values-based community and that values create value over time. More important, regardless of trading volume on OpenSea, we continued to see engagement in the community increase. That was a key metric for me personally.\n\nThe communities most exposed in these types of environments are “greed-based” communities. Ones that are literally only built on the intent to trade and try and profit.\n\nOver the coming months and years, I think art and collectibles will exist, but the bigger opportunity for the technology is with memberships, subscriptions, loyalty and rewards for consumers; and as a validator and efficiency play for businesses as it removes inefficiencies and ensures immutable truth.\n\nWhy did you decide to leave the media industry to lead an enterprise division for a crypto infrastructure company?\n\nThe switch was quite easy: I believe Web3 is the complete reinvention of the internet, whether through blockchain technologies, GPT, and AR/VR/metaversal experiences—all combined, all complementing one another. For most of my career, I have utilized emerging technologies to advance brands. Personally, I wanted to shift from using the technology to shaping the future of the industry and ecosystem. That is what MoonPay enabled me to do.\n\nWhat sentiment do you see among traditional brands? Are they still interested in getting into Web3 and NFTs, or did their interest decrease with the bear market?\n\nOur pipeline continues to strengthen as brands shift their focus toward using blockchain technology for memberships, subscriptions, rewards, and loyalty.\n\nCan you share the recent partnerships of MoonPay with traditional brands? And what are your future plans?\n\nMoonPay has done some incredible partnerships with Universal Studios, Nike, Alo Yoga, Puma, Christie’s, Condé Nast, and the like. Our future plans are to mainstream the adoption of this technology by highlighting the unique, enhanced experiences it provides.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest challenges facing the crypto industry in the next few years, and how is MoonPay working to address those challenges?\n\nI think the biggest challenges surround trust, clear regulation, and consumer protection. We take all of these very seriously and in recent months hired Lindsey Haswell to be our chief legal officer. We have also been investing heavily in compliance and legal frameworks for quite some time to ensure we evolve with the ecosystem as more clarity emerges. At the end of the day, we all should want a safe environment for consumers and clear rules for businesses."
