        "text": "The theme for International Women‚Äôs Day this year is ‚ÄúInvest in Women: Accelerate Progress,‚Äù and I can‚Äôt help but feel a special gratitude for the many people who have invested in me, personally, and in my company Gagen MacDonald. Gagen MacDonald, a pioneering, human-focused consulting firm, has been on an incredible journey. We‚Äôve shaped cultures, deepened employee engagement, and accelerated business outcomes through every type of change and transformation. From the largest M&A transactions to the most complex organizational shifts, we‚Äôve been there, accelerating progress and guiding our clients toward positive change. It's incredibly special to now be part of APCO, another remarkable, woman-owned company. Next week, we celebrate our first anniversary. Together, we‚Äôre joining forces to bring even deeper stakeholder insights and expertise to organizations worldwide. Margery Kraus, Founder and Chairman of APCO, and I founded our companies upon similar values, and I dreamt for over a decade about the impact we could create by blending our expertise. Now, as Gagen MacDonald operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of APCO, two women-owned companies united, we‚Äôre ready to shape the world that lies ahead. This is a success story, but it shouldn‚Äôt be a unique one. We need more like it ‚Äì and I know there are many more to come. Let‚Äôs continue breaking barriers, lifting each other up, and making history as we #InvestInWomen.\n\nüåü Recognizing Corporate Legends! üåü Introducing the \"Corporate Legend of the Year 2023\" Award by Australian Professionals of Colour (APOC). üèÜ Do you know someone who has been an extraordinary force for positive change in the workplace?

For a few years we've been talking about DEI mostly in terms of Diversity. Don't get me wrong--My belief is that organizations should reflect at all levels their customer base--but to focus only on Diversity is a mistake and I honestly think we should be looking at Inclusion first--or at least leaders should. Often we think of inclusion as a sentiment. How our employees feel...and to a certain extent it is that. Do ALL employees feel that their voice is heard? Do ALL employees feel that they are celebrated for their unique perspectives? Do All employees feel valued for what they bring to the table? Do all employees feel invited to the table? You get the idea. Inclusion temperature can of course be looked at with employee surveys. But there are other ways you can measure inclusion in your organization. Ways that might give you better insight into what is really happening. Open invite to join the November Allied Industry Inclusion Council where we will talk about Inclusion and Ways You Can MEASURE it.

Diversity and inclusion in the workplace go beyond hiring diverse talent; it extends to our external partnerships and collaborations. True diversity and inclusion make a company not only diverse within but also connected to the world outside. Internally, inclusion fosters a vibrant organizational culture, leveraging diverse perspectives, and enabling us to tap into new markets and engage in versatile forms of communication and representation. However, it's equally important to examine our external collaborations, sourcing practices, and service provider selection criteria. Inclusion and diversity thus demand our active engagement in vendor management, supply chains, and partnerships. Embracing diversity and inclusion isn't just about improving culture; it's a potent catalyst for positive change. It boosts productivity, enhances decision-making, and propels the adoption of sustainable practices. üåçüíö #Sustainability #DiversityAndInclusion #PositiveChange\"\n\nYesterday, I had a great conversation with Sonali Anderson, who was a fellow awardee at this year‚Äôs New England Women in Energy and the Environment (NEWIEE) Gala. It seems like every organization is touting their climate and DEI credentials lately, and we talked about how to determine whether companies are truly walking the talk. Here are two of the main points from our conversation: First, assess the company‚Äôs key performance indicators: What metrics and outcomes are they working toward? Is GHG reduction their main goal? Or financial growth? Do they have company-wide equity goals for both how they operate and the impact they generate? If so, how are they tracking on those? Knowing the answers to these questions tells you what is really at the heart of the organization and what will drive their decision making. Second, assess the company‚Äôs culture: What is their employee net promoter score and how has it changed over the past few years? How long have they been working on DEI? How are they putting their DEI commitments into practice? Do they have a DEI committee, culture committee, or employee resource groups to support their team members? What‚Äôs the average tenure of their staff and what percentage of employees are promoted into new roles annually? Having these answers tells you what it's like to work at--or work with--an organization and how they operate day to day. I'm happy to say VEIC has great answers to all of these questions and I'm proud of the work that we have done as an organization to get where we are today. There's still a lot of work to do, but we're on the right path. Thanks to NEWIEE for bringing us together and sparking a great conversation!\n\nAre you looking to attract a more diverse talent workforce?
