        "text": "Overview\n\nAd Fontes Media rates Time Magazine in the Skews Left category of bias and as Reliable, Analysis/Fact Reporting in terms of reliability. Time Magazine is a weekly news magazine and website. It has been based in New York City since its first edition in 1923. Among other regular features, Time is known for its Person of the Year designation.\n\nOverall Score\n\nThe following are the overall bias and reliability scores for Time Magazine according to our Ad Fontes Media ratings methodology.\n\nReliability: 41.12\n\nBias: -7.42\n\nPanels of analysts from Ad Fontes Media regularly review representative sample content to rate it for reliability and bias. Each panel of analysts comprises one left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one center-leaning analyst.\n\nThe team considers a variety of factors when rating content. To determine its reliability score, we consider the content’s veracity, expression, its title/headline, and graphics. We add each of these scores to the chart on a weighted scale, with the average of those creating the sample content’s overall reliability score.\n\nTo determine sample content’s bias score, we consider its language, its political position, and how it compares to other reporting or analysis from other sources on the same topic. We add each of these scores to the chart on a weighted scale, with the average of those creating the content’s overall bias score.\n\nThe bias rating, demonstrated on the Media Bias Chart®️ on the horizontal axis, ranges from most extreme left to middle to most extreme right. The reliability rating, demonstrated on the chart’s vertical axis, rates sources on a scale from original fact reporting to analysis, opinion, propaganda and inaccurate/fabricated information.\n\nReliability scores for articles and shows are on a scale of 0-64. Scores above 40 are generally good; scores below 24 are generally problematic. Scores between 24-40 indicate a range of possibilities, with some sources falling there because they are heavy in opinion and analysis, and some because they have a high variation in reliability between articles.\n\nBias scores for articles and shows are on a scale of -42 to +42, with higher negative scores being more left, higher positive scores being more right, and scores closer to zero being minimally biased, equally balanced, or exhibiting a centrist bias.\n\nIndividual Content Sample Scores\n\nThese are the most recent content samples that Ad Fontes Media analysts have rated for this source."
