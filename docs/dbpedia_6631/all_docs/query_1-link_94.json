        "text": "Here are the two most recent TIME magazine covers, each featuring two of the most powerful people in Washington, DC.\n\nOn the left, a dramatic black and white photo that was posed and lit to highlight the subject’s thoughtful demeanor as she weighs the decisions she’s made and the ones she’s yet to make. She’s looking into the distance, facing the light and with the darkness behind her. The photo is meant to be both inspirational and aspirational, and it succeeds.\n\nOn the right, a bland color photo that was posed and lit to present the subject in the most dull and uninspiring way possible. He’s in the most basic stance a person can make, looking straight at the camera with hands at his side — the kind of pose you’d do for an elementary school photo. His tie isn’t straight. The bottom of his suit jacket is open enough to sloppily show the tie beneath and one jacket sleeve is high enough to show the shirt beneath, while the other shows a bit of his watch.\n\nNow in your mind, flip these two covers. Imagine the Pelosi cover with her standing back to a wall, plainly looking at the camera, somewhat disheveled in appearance … and then imagine the Kushner cover showing him in striking black and white, staring ahead toward the light.\n\nQuite a different impression, isn’t it?\n\nAs I’ve said before (and will certainly say again), media bias can show up in very subtle ways: “I love journalism. I hate the way our current president (and his predecessor) attacks journalists. I think the work that our press does is utterly critical to a strong democracy. But I also hate how so many of them let their personal biases slip into their work.”\n\nThat applies to you, too, TIME magazine cover designers.\n\nActually, this post is more about praise of one specific magazine, although I have said before that I continue to enjoy several magazines.\n\nThe one I’m talking about is TIME magazine, which we just started subscribing to this month. I was at the eye doctor with my daughter a few weeks ago and picked up an issue and read some of it in the waiting area, and was really impressed by the depth of their coverage. Decided to subscribe and our first issue just arrived this week.\n\nGuess what? I learned more in the first 20 pages of the first issue than I’ve learned in the past three months of watching TV news and reading links found on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nI had no idea, for example, that — on a per capita basis — Belgium is Europe’s top source of foreign fighters that join ISIS. And that the next big fear among defense and security officials is that ISIS will get its hands on the nuclear materials needed to make a dirty bomb. In fact, when ISIS overran Mosul, Iraq, in 2014, it got access to about 90 pounds of radiological material from a university in the city. Scary, huh?\n\nI also learned that, even though Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won Burma’s recent election, the military — which controls 25% of parliament — wrote a new constitutional clause that keeps her from becoming president. Instead, a close confidant of hers (and a male) will become president, while Suu Kyi is “expected to take four ministerial portfolios.”\n\nI learned that President Obama’s visit to Cuba was not as peachy as it appeared on network news. Just hours before Obama landed, Cuban police rounded up dissidents — a reminder, as TIME put it, that the country is still a “police state.”\n\nI learned that residents of Great Britain will soon be voting on whether their country should remain part of the EU, and how that decision could cause a domino effect across Europe.\n\nAnd here at home, I learned about the machinations happening behind the scenes as the Republican party tries to get its convention delegates to vote against Trump in Cleveland later this year. Here’s some background on how both parties handle primaries/caucuses and assigning delegates.\n\nAll this in just the first 20 pages of the magazine.\n\nAnd it made me think about the real value that a weekly news magazine has in this day and age. Cable news, network TV news and even mass online news publications have to fight for attention in the non-stop rush of a 24-hour news cycle. The demand for eyeballs leads to some very sketchy journalistic choices and doesn’t allow much room for the type of reporting depth that a weekly magazine can provide. TIME (and others like it) may be fighting for subscribers, but they don’t need to outdo themselves every day with something more titillating than yesterday’s stories. It’s super refreshing to get actual news and information without all the shouting and “can you top this?” journalism that you find on cable TV and in social media.\n\nNeedless to say, I’m really happy that we started this subscription."
