What started as a weekly magazine over 100 years ago has branched into multiple publications, a film and television studio, and a continuous need to innovate both products and partnerships.\n\nTIME.com is the brand’s online publication with a readership in the millions. Powered by WordPress, the TIME website is a prime example of the platform’s scalability. Between the amount of content published daily and the need for editorial excellence, TIME can balance it all without compromising the quality of its digital experience."
