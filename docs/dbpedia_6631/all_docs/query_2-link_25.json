The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nTime magazine has signed a multi-year content deal with OpenAI that would give the ChatGPT maker access to its archive of news content, the companies said on Thursday.\n\nIn response to user queries, the chatbot will cite and link back to the original source on Time.com, the companies added in a statement. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThe artificial intelligence company has signed similar deals over the past few months with the Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, France's Le Monde and Spain-based Prisa Media.\n\nWhile some media companies like the New York Times and The Intercept have previously sued OpenAI for the use of their journalism, these content partnerships are essential for training AI models.\n\nThese deals can also provide lucrative opportunity for news publishers, who have historically been excluded from the profits that internet giants generate by distributing their content.\n\nIn May, Microsoft-backed OpenAI signed content and product partnerships with The Atlantic and Vox Media.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nFive reasons why India’s Economic Survey mentioned Apple five times\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
