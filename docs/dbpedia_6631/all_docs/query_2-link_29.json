        "text": "UKG, a leading provider of HR, payroll, and workforce management solutions for all people, is one of the World’s Best Companies of 2023, according to TIME magazine. The inaugural list honors companies from across industries with great workplace cultures, continued business growth, and positive sustainability practices.\n\nThe recognition is the latest in a string of recent workplace-culture accolades for UKG. This includes Forbes naming the company one of America’s Best Employers for Women and for Diversity, as well as Newsweek featuring UKG on its America’s Greatest Workplaces list and separate Newsweek lists for Diversity and for Women. Last month, UKG earned a SHRM India HR Excellence award for “Excellence in Talent Acquisition,” celebrating practices that redefine talent acquisition and the employee experience in becoming an “employer of choice” worldwide.\n\nUKG is also Great Place To Work™ Certified in all 10 countries where it has a significant employee presence. Obtaining the annual certification is based on a global Trust Index survey of employees that measures whether companies are providing a great workplace for every employee, no matter where they work or their role in the organisation, through the For All Methodology and Trust Model.\n\n“We are on a mission to inspire every organisation to become a great place to work, and that starts with what we’re doing for our 15,000 U Krewers, and through the people-focused technology we provide for 80,000 UKG customers,” said Pat Wadors, chief people officer at UKG. “We aspire to be a live-action case study on what it takes to foster a culture for all people that, in turn, leads to better business results. How we treat and inspire our own people directly impacts the way we design, deliver, and support our HCM solutions for our customers and their tens of millions of employees across the globe.”\n\nBuilding an ecosystem of equity for all\n\nOperating with a belief that diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and social impact are all business imperatives, UKG encourages a culture of belonging that fosters an inclusive environment, celebrates individual differences, and maximises innovation. The UKG Belonging, Equity, and Impact (BE&I) strategy centres on the theme “Uniquely you. Uniquely valued. Uniquely empowered.” BE&I’s programs include four pillars to support this purpose both at UKG and beyond: creating opportunities for every person, enriching every workplace culture, uplifting every community, and showcasing the competitive advantage.\n\nTo that end, the new State of BE&I at UKG interactive experience features “Stories with Purpose” as told by UKG employees, customers, and global partners to show the widescale impact of welcoming all identities, celebrating differences, and working together to expand equity. UKG also offers nine employee resource groups for community members and their allies to help build a culture of trust, equity, and belonging for all U Krewers. Through its Unified BE&I Foundational Learning Program, the company promotes greater understanding and inclusion of all abilities in the workplace.\n\nBeyond the workplace, UKG encourages its employees to serve in their local communities, and every U Krewer receives at least two paid days for volunteering annually through the company’s Global Volunteer Time-Off Policy. Together, this represents more than 245,000 hours of global impact each year.\n\n[Read the UKG Global Impact Report to learn more about how UKG is making a difference worldwide, and view the company’s long-term plans in reaching its environmental, social, and governance goals.]\n\nSupporting every career, life stage with standout benefits\n\nWith a commitment to supporting its employees at every stage of their careers and lives, UKG provides a standout global benefits program highlighted by 100%-paid healthcare premiums for the majority of employees worldwide for medical, dental, and vision — including for spouses, domestic partners, and dependents — with coverage for infertility treatments, gender affirmation surgery, and surrogacy reimbursement, where allowed. UKG also offers a 45% dollar-for-dollar match on employee retirement-fund contributions in the U.S. and Canada, as well as retirement-matching programs worldwide.\n\nIn January, UKG rolled out a global equitable benefits program called U Choose, providing employees up to $1,400 annually that they can use for more than 150 different life expenses, from childcare and kids’ extracurriculars to pet care and personal wellness or lifestyle activities.\n\nSupporting Resources\n\nLearn more about UKG and why our purpose is people.\n\nExperience inspiration at work.
