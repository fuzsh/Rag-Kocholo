        "text": "The influence of 21 Savage can not be denied,\n\nThe British-born and Atlanta-raised rap superstar was named one of the \"most influential people\" of the year by Time Magazine.\n\nBurna Boy paid tribute to 21 Savage in an essay expressing his admiration for his friend’s artistry and humanity.\n\n“I trust my gut when it comes to my music and collaborations, and I find myself naturally drawn to artists like 21 Savage—those who remain grounded in their convictions and consistently defy the constraints imposed upon them. Like 21, I know what it’s like to rise above challenging beginnings, and it makes his success all that much more remarkable,” Burna Boy wrote. “Throughout his work—including on his newest album, American Dream, which opens with a reflection by his mother on their immigration story—21 maintains an authenticity that resonates deeply.”\n\n“His approach to rap is refreshingly genuine; he speaks to us in a relatable way, effortlessly navigating the complexities of the genre. Whether he tackles weighty subjects or offers moments of levity, his delivery remains compelling,” Burna Boy continued.\n\n“I have recently had the privilege of sharing one of my most significant milestones with 21, performing with him at the Grammys,” he added. “I’m excited to witness the greater evolution of his artistry and the impact he continues to make on the world stage.”\n\nFor most of 2023, 21 Savage was out on the road on Drake’s It’s All A Blur Tour before releasing his highly anticipated album American Dream in January.\n\nHis fourth solo project debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 with 133,000 equivalent album sales during the first week of its release.\n\nAlong with 21 Savage, Tarij P. Henson, Patrick Mahomes, Fantasia Barrino, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Colman Domingo, James McBride, Jeffrey Wright, and more.\n\nCheck here for the complete list of honorees.\n\nBy clicking Subscribe, you confirm that you have read and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
