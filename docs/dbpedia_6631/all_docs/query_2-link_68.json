No one seemed to care about us.\n\nBut publicity and widespread attention came in 1977 along with the Sex Pistols.\n\nIn the summer of 1977 when we heard that Time Magazine was coming to the Rat we really were surprised.\n\nWhen the article came out, with it's focus on the bizarre, it was roundly put down. We punkers were pissed.\n\nReading it now, it's doesn't seem as bad, but the pictures show that Time was looking for the outrageous.\n\nA parachute costume with fresh meat? Is this really representative of anything?\n\nThe article appears below, give it a read.\n\nWhat would you think of this music if all you had to go by was this article?\n\nAnthems of the Blank Generation\n\nJuly 11, 1977\n\nITEM: In London, Singer Johnny Rotten spits at the audience and cries out, \"I hate you!\" Sizing up Johnny's four-letter words, tattered clothing and generally repugnant personal deportment, the British Establishment decides that it hates him. Johnny and his band, the Sex Pistols, are regularly banned from British radio, concert halls and clubs. Nonetheless, the Pistols ' latest single, a Jubilee diatribe against royalty called God Save the Queen, is currently a bestselling record in Britain.\n\nITEM: In West Hollywood, members of a group called the Germs try to redeem a slow evening at the Whisky by smearing themselves with peanut butter.\n\nITEM: In Boston, the lead singer of the Dead Boys takes a swan dive to the stage floor of a joint called The Rat. He wears a leather jacket and a T shirt decorated with swastikas. He begins to stroke the torn crotch of his jeans with a vibrator. He shrieks, \"This is what love is!\"\n\nITEM: In New York, the up-and-coming Ramones decide to turn away from negative songs like I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement in favor of the upbeat Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue.\n\nITEM: In Florida, Promoter Sidney Drashin declares that it is only a matter of time before the punk invasion begins there. Says he: \"Our company believes it's going to break loose big. It's everywhere. \"\n\nYe gods, the thoughtful, thirtyish ex-Beatles freak may well ask, what is happening to the younger generation? In Tokyo, Chicago and Paris, kids are bumping, grinding, loving, hating, wailing to the loud, raucous, often brutal sounds of punk rock. For a year or so, punk has been flourishing in the seediest rock joints-a Bowery bar called CBGB's in New York, a dingy cavern called the Roxy in London, and The Rat in Boston. There, shock is chic. Musicians and listeners strut around in deliberately torn T shirts and jeans; ideally, the rips should be joined with safety pins. Another fad is baggy pants with a direct connection between fly and pocket. These are called dumpies. Swastika emblems go well with such outfits. In London, the hair is often heavily greased and swept up into a cox comb of blue, orange or green, or a comely two-tone. Pierced ears may sport safety pins, some made of gold or silver. Of late, punk chic has even been taken up by a few high-fashion designers. But the punkers themselves are beginning to tone down the safety-pin excesses of a few months ago.\n\nBuzz and Blast. Up on the stage can be found a numbing array of groups and soloists whose names dramatize the nihilism and brute force that have inspired the movement: Clash, Thundertrain, Weirdos, Dictators, Stranglers, Damned, and the demon-eyed New Yorker who could become the Mick Jagger of punk, Richard Hell. The music aims for the gut. Even compared with the more elemental stylings of 1950s rock 'n' roll which it closely resembles punk rock is a primal scream. The music comes in fast, short bursts of buzz and blast. Some groups have but two or three chord changes at their disposal, occasionally less: last week at CBGB's a fledgling group set several unofficial records for length of time played without changing chords at all.\n\nEven on the Bowery, lyrics are not as rowdy as in Britain. Punk there is a protest by Britain's working-class children, who have no memory of swinging London and cannot find jobs. Detractors of punk would argue that these children are coddled by a very expensive welfare state and are feeling sorry for themselves. Still, the Sex Pistols' piledriving Anarchy in the U.K. is an anthem of despair. The British punk bands are a community linked by anger and frustration. They are, within the music world, a rebuke to the bourgeois excesses and smooth musical stylingsof such stars as Elton John and Peter Frampton.\n\nSays Johnny Rotten: \"The millionaire groups were singing about love and their own hang-ups. That's stupid. You don't sing about love to people on the dole.\" Blithefully, whiningly, punk says anything and everything. As the Sex Pistols chant, \"God save the Queen/ She ain't no human being.\"\n\nDespite some of the revolting accouterments, there is real musical value in much of punk rock. More and more, the punkers find themselves being referred to as members of yet another New Wave. Sex Pistols Manager Malcolm McLaren regards that as highfalutin, calling the phrase \"Establishment language, more descriptive of a new hairstyle than anything else.\" In truth, New Wave does seem an apt catch-all label for the energetic and varied kind of music that has emerged in recent months from some of the young American bands. The Ramones stick close to basic rock 'n' roll, but they get better all the time. Last week their latest single Sheena is a Punk Rocker made the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the first New Wave song to achieve that eminence.\n\nTelevision, which got its start at CBGB's, wraps its big beat in mellifluous instrumental colors. Lead Singer Tom Verlaine's lyrics, like the following from Venus, are among rock's finest in years:\n\nTight toy night; streets were so bright.\n\nThe world looked so thin and\n\nbetween my bones and skin\n\nthere stood another person who\n\nwas a little surprised\n\nto beface to face with a world so alive.\n\nI fell.\n\nRichard Hell's Blank Generation, delivered over a throbbing four-note bass ostinato, is already a punk classic:\n\nI was sayin ' let me out of here\n\nbefore I was even born.\n\nIt's such a gamble when you get a face...\n\nI belong to the blank generation,\n\nAnd you can take it or leave it each time.\n\nSire Records' Seymour Stein, an early champion of punk, finds that the music reflects a mood of total indifference among the young. \"They feel they had nothing to do with making the world the mess it is today, and they're also not going to do anything to make it any better because they can't. They come to the music for the sake of the music, for entertainment, for getting it on.\" Getting it on, of course, means love and sex, passions that old time rock 'n' roll had plenty to say about. But today's punk rockers have no time for euphemisms like Chuck Berry's \"ding-a-ling.\" Four-letter words are not spared. And when Thundertrain bawls, \" I'm hot, hot. hot, hot for teacher,\" there is no missing the point. The 1970s have been dominated by graduates of the 1960s rock era Paul Simon and Paul McCartney moving out on their own, groups like the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Starship rambling on as before. The New Wave seems to be saying, \"The superstars are dead. Long live the superstars.\" Down with the smooth confections of commercial rock, even the harmless purr of disco. Says one punk devotee: \"Disco was the final straw.\" Willie (\"Loco\") Alexander, leader of a Boston band, revels in the studied toughness, calculated cool and throbbing boom-boom of the New Wave. Says he: 'Punk looks right at you and says something.\""
