        "text": "A periodical is any publication that is published multiple times (periodically). Periodicals include materials such as popular magazines, scholarly journals, and newspapers.\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between a popular periodical and a scholarly one. When you are doing research, most of your sources should be scholarly.\n\nOften, popular periodicals are called magazines and scholarly periodicals are called journals. Many times it will be acceptable to use some popular material, but research papers should not be based solely on popular literature.\n\nScholarly sources are in-depth accounts of original research. Scholarly sources are written by experts in a particular field or discipline, and their primary intended audience is other experts in that particular field and students of that discipline. They are written for the purpose of scholarly communication; to report findings and advance research. The language used often includes specialized terminology. Importantly, authors of scholarly sources are required to provide properly-formatted references or citations for the information in their papers. Scholarly sources go through a peer-review process where other experts in the field look at the content, format, and style of the paper before publication.\n\nScholarly sources include journals such as Journal of the American Medical Association, Journal of Data Information and Management, and American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nPeer review is the rigorous process through which the validity and quality of a scholarly article are determined before publication in scientific, academic, or professional journals.\n\nPeer review maintains the integrity of scientific research by stopping the publication of invalid or poor quality work. Scholarly sources go through the peer review process and popular sources do not, but that is not the only difference between popular and scholarly sources.\n\nThe peer-review process is also sometimes called \"refereeing,\" so a peer-reviewed journal might also be called a \"refereed journal.\"\n\nCAUTION: Not every article in a peer-reviewed journal is peer-reviewed. Scholarly journals also contain articles like book reviews, opinion pieces, introductory articles, editorials, etc. that have not gone through the peer-review process. If you must use scholarly, peer-reviewed sources for a project or paper, you need to look at the article yourself to determine if it is one of the peer-reviewed, scholarly articles published in the journal or not.\n\nWatch the videos below, created by the librarians at North Carolina State University, for an overview of the peer-review process and how scholarly articles make their way from researcher to publication to library.\n\nTrade sources, such as trade journals or trade magazines, are periodicals that publish articles relevant to a particular field or industry. They are usually written by professionals actively working in the field, or by journalists who have knowledge of the field. A trade source's primary intended audience is working professionals. Trade sources often have advertisements that are targeted to the professionals in that industry, highlighting specific tools or products that would be used in their work. Trade sources may sometimes include references or citations, but they are generally not required.\n\nTrade sources include journals and magazines such as American Libraries, Trade Finance, and GPS World:"
