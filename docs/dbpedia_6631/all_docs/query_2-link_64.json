        "text": "“Raise your hand if you want to change the world.”\n\nWith this call to action, Time Magazine’s “2020 Kid of the Year,” Gitanjali Rao, led Middle School students on an inspiring journey of her path towards becoming a young inventor, scientist, author, and changemaker. At eighteen years old, Gitanjali has already made a significant impact worldwide using science to tackle challenges of contaminated drinking water, opioid addiction, and cyberbullying.\n\nGitanjali spent her childhood falling in love with science. She was the kid building baking soda volcanoes in her kitchen and constantly watching science documentaries. By the age of ten, she had built prototypes for several groundbreaking innovations, including “Tethys,” a device to detect lead in drinking water, and “Epione,” a technology to diagnose prescription opioid addiction. Her work is driven by empathy and a deep desire to make the world a better place. Each of Gitanjali’s inventions has a human focus and starts with the question “Who will this help?”\n\nNow a freshman at MIT, Gitanjali is a bioengineering major who is determined to apply science and technology to solve global inequities and health care problems. In 2017 she was named America’s Top Young Scientist. Following this, she won the global Paradigm science challenge and in 2019 she was recognized as a 2019 Forbes 30 Under 30 for science. Gitanjali is the author of two books and has traveled to over six continents and 46 countries to bring her love of science and message of inspiration to more than 85,000 students.\n\nGitanjali’s advice to our Middle School students? Find a mentor and begin to shadow interesting work. Consider the problems they are passionate about. And more importantly? Persist. Stay with the problem. “You’ll need to be a risk-taker,” Gitanjali said. “Failure is part of the process. Let empathy drive all of your solutions, and remember to take your time. As Albert Einstein once said, “I’m not that smart. I just stay with the problem longer.”\n\nFollowing her presentation, Gitanjali led seventh and eighth-grade students in a problem-solving workshop focusing on the 5-steps problem-solving technique. This experience supports seventh and eighth grade students to approach their Sustainable Goals and Capstone projects with a solutions-oriented framework and the ability to critically evaluate results.\n\nGitanjali acknowledged that the journey of design and experimentation is filled with obstacles. However, she reminded the group to seek help from others and cultivate resources of support. “At the end of the day, we’re kids. You are not expected to do this alone. Look to your parents or your teachers. Find a mentor who will stick with you. I wouldn’t be up here if it weren’t for the adults who pushed me throughout my life.”"
