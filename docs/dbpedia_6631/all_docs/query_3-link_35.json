Do not italicize the titles of articles.\n\nCapitalize only the first letter of the first word of the article title. If there is a colon in the article title, also capitalize the first letter of the first word after the colon.\n\nDates\n\nIf an article has no date, use the short form n.d. where you would normally put the date.\n\nVolume and Issue Numbers\n\nItalicize volume numbers but not issue numbers.\n\nRetrieval Dates\n\nMost articles will not need these in the citation since you only need to provide a retrieval date when citing from places where content may change often and without notice.\n\nPage Numbers\n\nIf an article doesn't appear on continuous pages, list all the page numbers the article is on, separated by commas. For example (4, 6, 12-14)\n\nAnonymous. (Year of Publication, Month Day if Given). Article title: Subtitle if any. Name of Magazine, Volume Number(Issue Number), first page number-last page number if given.\n\nNote: If and only if the work is signed \"Anonymous\", use Anonymous where you'd normally put the author's name. If the work has no named author but is not signed \"Anonymous\", follow the example for Unknown Author."
