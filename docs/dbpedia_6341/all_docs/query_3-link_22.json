        "text": "Treyarch is developing 2015's Call of Duty game, Activision announced today. During an investor call, Activision said this year's CoD title will be the first from Treyarch to have a three-year development cycle. The first Call of Duty game to receive three years of development time was last year's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.\n\nTreyarch was the developer behind Call of Duty 3, World at War, Black Ops, Black Ops II, and other non-mainline Call of Duty games. Treyarch's studio head Mark Lamia recently shared at the Las Vegas DICE Summit that the series' beloved Zombies mode almost didn't exist.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhen we know more about the new game, including the title, we'll let you know. As for right now, Advanced Warfare's Havoc DLC is coming to PS4, PS3, and PC on February 26.\n\nSince its launch in 2003, the Call of Duty franchise has earned over $11 billion USD. Brian is an associate editor at IGN. You can follow him @albinoalbert on Twitter.\n\nMore Call of Duty"
