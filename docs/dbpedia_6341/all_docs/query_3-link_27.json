        "text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives surrounded by the mystery that characterizes Treyarch releases. The saga recovers the numbering after a passage through the Cold War that broke the tradition. Why such a sudden change from one game to another? Problems in the organization of the studios responsible for the saga could be one of the reasons why the studio decided to unlink the number of the last installment.\n\nWhy is the next Call of Duty Black Ops 6? The truth about Cold War\n\nActivision has never confirmed the details of the name change of these games. A multitude of leaks with Tom Henderson and Jason Schreier at the helm shed some light on this issue. Call of Duty shares leadership with three studios: Infinity Ward (Modern Warfare), Treyarch (Black Ops) and Sledgehammer (WWII, Advanced Warfare). In addition, other teams such as Raven Software and Beenox support the brand’s various products.\n\nSledgehammer’s vision was completely different from that of Raven to shape what would become Call of Duty 2020, a relevant installment for being the first of the next generation consoles. The deadlines in which the titles of the franchise are developed are short, and any setback can mean that the shadow of delay looms over them, something that does not fit in Activision’s financial plans.\n\nSo the publisher took a drastic solution: Treyarch postponed its 2021 project to prepare what would become known as Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. The studio focused on the development of the multiplayer and cooperative (zombie) side, while Raven worked entirely on the single-player campaign. With the pandemic in the way, development was complicated and was one of the reasons why the game came out with so little content (only 8 competitive maps at launch). The rush of development was also felt in terms of stability. The game had a development cycle of only two years.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the opposite case. Although a part of Treyarch worked as support in deliveries such as Call of Duty: Vanguard, the bulk of the team took the 2021 project and continued to develop it to form the delivery with the longest development time in the recent history of the series (4 years). They are proud of what they have done, and that is probably why the numbering has returned to the title."
