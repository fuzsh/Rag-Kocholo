        "text": "Season 1 Arrives in Modern Warfare III\n\nPrepare for all-new warfare as Season 1 arrives for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III and Call of Duty®: Warzone™. The new season brings more Multiplayer maps; new and returning game modes including Gunfight and Vortex; the next story Act in Zombies; the introduction of Urzikstan in Call of Duty: Warzone, and much more.\n\nAn all-new Battle Pass brings 100 Tiers of content, BlackCell brings the Abolisher Operator, and your arsenal is increased with five additional new weapons. Also expect a host of new Aftermarket Parts, including your own flamethrower! The heat continues into the holidays with themed events throughout the season, ensuring a vast wealth of content for you to drop into.\n\nConsult the Call of Duty Blog for all official comms and announcements.\n\nExpect Patch Notes to be available prior to the release of Season 1, with separate notes for Modern Warfare III (led by Sledgehammer Games and Treyarch) and Warzone (led by Raven Software).\n\nBe sure to check out free and official Guides to Call of Duty: Warzone and the new MWIII Multiplayer Maps.\n\nReady up: Here’s what’s dropping:\n\nMODERN WARFARE III MULTIPLAYER OVERVIEW\n\nGunfight returns to Call of Duty, pitting two teams of two against one another in a round-based match. There are no respawns, and all players are assigned the same randomized Loadout at the start of each round.\n\nThe assigned Loadout changes every two rounds, and you never know what you’ll get; you may be trading shots with Battle Rifles one round and then rushing in with Shotguns the next. In other words, take what you’re given and make it worse.\n\nEach round lasts 40 seconds, in which teams attempt to eliminate the other side. If time runs out and both teams are still alive, an Overtime Flag will spawn on the map for 10 seconds. The first team to capture the flag or eliminate the enemy team wins the round. If neither team wins during Overtime, the team with the most health wins.\n\nThe first team to win six rounds wins the match.\n\nFive Gunfight maps at launch: Season 1 brings the new Training Facility map along with four Carry Forward Gunfight maps from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II: Alley, Blacksite, Exhibit, and Shipment.\n\nGame Mode: All or Nothing (Launch)\n\nPresented by Treyarch in partnership with Sledgehammer Games, Multiplayer Ranked Play launches mid-season and builds upon the foundation established in Modern Warfare II with new rewards to earn and updated Modern Warfare III maps, weapons, and Loadout content.\n\nRanked Play is a feature-packed, stand-alone competitive Multiplayer mode that leverages the Call of Duty® League approved rules, restrictions, maps, and modes. Track your standing with a visible skill rating and earn rewards across multiple Skill Divisions and Tiers. The best of the best will be featured in the Top 250 Leaderboard and Division for the chance to prove themselves as the number one player. Look for further information, including the rewards for ranking up, in the following weeks.\n\nMODERN WARFARE ZOMBIES OVERVIEW\n\nBig Game Bounty Contract: Activate this Contract to put a Bounty on the Player with the most eliminations in the match; take them out to earn an Advanced UAV.\n\n\"Fly Buy” Public Event: A new Public Event arrives in Urzikstan, where there is a chance that multiple Drones will fly-in to drop additional Buy Stations into the Warzone.\n\nUpdated Strongholds: In order to make each match unique, Strongholds have now been moved to the Public Event system where there is a percentage chance of them becoming accessible to infiltrate during an Infil. As a result of this change, players may also encounter Cash Drops during Infil, and may also find Blacksite keys in ground loot allowing you the opportunity to open a Black Site in any match.\n\nNew Perks (Launch)\n\nThe Perk system currently in Warzone continues, with Operators choosing from either a pre-set or a Custom Perk Package consisting of four Perks which become active once your Loadout is claimed. Perk Packs can also be found in ground loot, whether dropped by an eliminated Player or found in Supply Boxes.\n\nMovement and rotation opportunities on the new big map of Urzikstan has been a key focus of its design, so in the new chapter of Warzone Players will also find themselves with several Perks that are now simply enabled by default at all times:\n\nTac Pads: Improves slide distance and allows for full ADS while sliding, along with increased stance transition speeds.\n\nCommando Gloves: Enables reloading while running.\n\nQuick-Grip Gloves: Increases your weapon swap speed.\n\nClimbing Boots: Increases climbing and mantling speed aspect.\n\nOverkill: Allows you to pick two Primary Weapons.\n\nUrzikstan features a new Gulag, the perfect way to redeploy once you’ve faced down an adversary in 1v1 combat. However, this Gulag, aside from being a brand-new environment, comes with new gameplay updates too:\n\nAscender Overtime Finisher: Replacing the old overtime flag, players are now provided an exfil rope that drops into the middle of the Gulag during the match allowing extraction – but, be warned! You can both shoot, and be shot at, from the Ascender!\n\nGulag Public Events: Several new Public Events may also occur within the Gulag, such as Go Again (an additional Gulag attempt if you lose the first fight), Cash Grab (more money on the floor with a big stack in the middle of the map) and Locked & Loaded Weapons (AMG + SMG Loadout with full armor), helping the victor by bringing back some much-needed power items into the match.\n\nNight Vision Gulag (In-Season): NVG has a new name, as the Gulag will occasionally go dark while equipping Operators with night-vision goggles for a fun new twist on the Gulag experience.\n\nAdditional Content (In-Season)\n\nSeason 1 Reloaded, available in early 2024, will bring with it a number of new features including Covert Exfil – a new secondary exfil condition – as well as the Weapon Case similar to that seen in Modern Warfare II but with brand new rewards. In addition, players can expect a new Champion’s Quest with fresh rewards for those brave and strategic enough to complete it – or steal it...\n\nNew Event: Merry CODMAS (In-Season)\n\nKrampus is back!\n\nJust kidding. Instead, get into the festive mood with CODMAS! This Holiday Event brings new challenges and rewards (some visible, some hidden!) to the Urzikstan map in Call of Duty: Warzone in the form of Deck the Halls, Zombie Santa, and Slay Ride.\n\nDeck the Halls: Santa has delivered presents across Urzikstan, via a number of holiday crates. Open the Tac Map to reveal their location in the match and get to the trees to earn the rewards in the vicinity. However, be ready to fight for your spot as a flare is sent up when Operators interact within the immediate area where the crates are found. Those who hold the point the longest will be gifted a chance to meet Santa... or at least something that used to be Santa.\n\nZombie Santa: Once an Operator obtains a key from Deck the Halls, a “Merry” portal will appear. Take the portal to face off against a zombified Juggernaut Santa. Defeat this evil incarnation of Santa before rummaging in his massive sack for a variety of valuable loot!\n\nJAK Purifier\n\nCompatability: MCW, MTZ-556, Holger 556, DG-56, SVA 545, RAM-7, MTZ-762, BAS-B, Sidewinder, Riveter\n\nEquip an underbarrel flamethrower. What more needs to be said? Burn it all down. The JAK Purifier AMP is compatible with several weapons, including multiple Assault Rifles, Battle Rifles, and the Riveter Shotgun.\n\nJAK Ettin Double Barrel Kit\n\nCompatability: AMR9\n\nAvailable for the AMR9 SMG, this kit creates two stacked barrels that fire simultaneously. This offers twice as much down-range damage at the cost of some accuracy.\n\nJAK Thunder LMG Kit\n\nCompatability: Sidewinder (BR)\n\nDominate lanes and hold objectives with this LMG conversion kit for the Sidewinder Battle Rifle that brings a large capacity magazine and ramps in fire rate the longer you hold down the trigger.\n\nJAK BRB\n\nCompatability: Many Assault Rifles, Submachine Guns, Battle Rifles, Marksman Rifles, and Sniper Rifles.\n\nGo loud. This compensator borders on excessive, offering a phenomenal reduction to recoil while significantly increasing muzzle report, resulting in an extended red dot on enemy radars.\n\nJAK Bullseye\n\nCompatability: [[REDACTED]]\n\nVery low-profile dot Optic. Limited interference from framework offers an exceptionally clear sight picture.\n\nJAK Signal Burst\n\nCompatability: Holger 556 (AR)\n\nA conversion kit designed for accuracy and controllability with four-round bursts.\n\nJAK Beholder Rifle Kit\n\nCompatability: TYR (Handgun)\n\nA long and heavy barrel that offers the best increase to range.

Infinity Ward and all the development teams who contributed to the creation of DMZ are incredibly proud and delighted to see the enthusiasm and participation that you’ve shown since its release, and to see so many players pouring into the MWZ mode in Modern Warfare III, which has many DMZ-inspired gameplay aspects within it.\n\nBeginning with next week’s launch of Season 1, DMZ Beta players can continue the mode via the Call of Duty: Warzone section of COD HQ. The DMZ Beta will remain fully playable across all current DMZ content, including Al Mazrah, Ashika Island, the Koschei Complex, Building 21, Vondel, as well as all DMZ missions. The mode will not be available or interact directly within Modern Warfare III or Call of Duty: Warzone which means that progression and any new Modern Warfare III or Warzone content, including Battle Pass or store bundles, will not sync or carry back into this DMZ mode. Also, DMZ progress will not apply to new Battle Passes beginning with Season 1.\n\nWe recognize that not having cross progression with Modern Warfare III and Warzone may be frustrating for some players, but we felt now was the time to take all the learnings from the Beta that we could apply toward future development efforts as we evolve this style of play. We also know that many players still enjoy the mode and wanted to ensure that everybody can keep playing, which is why we are keeping a variety of content available.\n\nGoing forward, development teams will continue to evolve these dynamic open world experiences into the future. We look forward to sharing updates when ready.\n\nCDL Pack and 2024 Season Announcement\n\nThe 2024 Call of Duty League™ Launch Pack on sale December 6\n\nThe 2024 Call of Duty League Launch Pack goes on sale December 6, just in time for the start of the season beginning on December 8.
