        "text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is the next Call of Duty game being made by Treyarch for the PS4, Xbox One and PC. Like every installment in the series the black ops 3 game is launching early November (November 6, 2015) - this year has been dubbed as the new \"Black Friday\".\n\nMultiplayer has evolved substantially since Black Ops II with new game modes and features. Check out the multiplayer black ops 3 guns and stats, and while you are at it, the black ops 3 pro perks are also available for inspection. Fans of the zombies mode will enjoy the the new zombies mode in black ops 3 which features a full blown campaign and a progression system.\n\nWith the new Specialist character system the black ops 3 score/kill streaks list has been revamped to take account the new ambitious design choices. There will be four DLC updates released in 2016, but for the first time ever, all the black ops 3 multiplayer / dlc updates are PlayStation exclusives for one month.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare is the next installment in the COD series. The game is to be released on November 4, 2014 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. Harnessing the power of next-gen platforms, Sledgehammer Games has built the aw game from the ground up and integrated a whole new intelligent sound system to it.\n\nIn multiplayer, players have been given exosuits that make them stronger, faster and allows for things like boost jumping. Although each soldier has augmented abilities, multiplayer weapons are as powerful as ever, as seen in the aw guns list & stats update. All the perks in Advanced Warfare (AW) have been revamped to work with the exosuit, although the aw pro perks list is still not final, Sledgehammer Games has promised that the game's MP will be extremely balanced.\n\nScorestreaks have received a lot of focus and are now customizable. As seen in the aw kill streaks list, powerful Warbird and Paladin gunships can be upgraded to be controllable by two players simultaneously.\n\nThe Advanced Warfare collector's editions include a bonus map called \"Atlas Gorge\", which is a remake of the Pipeline multiplayer map from COD4. There will be four aw multiplayer dlc updates released in 2015.\n\nCOD: AW pre-orders will receive the Zero Edition version of the game that includes a 24 hour early access to the game.\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts is the tenth main Call of Duty game. Ghosts features a next-gen engine developed by Infinity Ward, Neversoft and Raven Software. The cod: ghosts game engine delivers gorgeously rendered environments, stunning and lifelike characters, and authentic real-world animations.\n\nMultiplayer in Call of Duty: Ghosts will be unlike that in any previous Call of Duty to date. Thanks to the new engine, the cod: ghosts guns have received huge upgrades and are like their real-life counterparts, but that's not all, Ghost MP has also received important updates. Many of the cod: ghosts perks are redefined for next-gen combat, but old COD favorites such as the Scavenger and Hardline perk are back.\n\nLast year's Call of Duty: Black Ops II had NukeTown 2025 as a pre-order bonus and this year's Ghosts will have a similar incentive. Every gamer that pre-orders the game will get the Free Fall DLC added to their cod: ghosts multiplayer maps menu; Free Fall drops you into a shattered skyscraper on the brink of collapse. With every drop, the shockwaves cause further destruction, disrupting paths and chokepoints as the map changes in real-time.\n\nCOD: Ghosts will be released on 5th of November 2013 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 2 (BO2) is an upcoming first-person shooter developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. Black Ops II is the ninth game in the Call of Duty franchise of video games and a sequel to the 2010 game COD: Black Ops. Black Ops 2 takes place in the 1980s for the first third of the game, and in 2025 for the final 2/3.\n\nThe Zombies mode will return for Black Ops 2 (BO2) with its own campaign and will implement the multiplayer engine, allowing for a deeper community experience along with new game modes. With the all new point allocation system players can freely choose their primary and secondary weapons, attachments, bo2 perks, and such based on their needs. The bo2 multiplayer guns are mostly futuristic, but have been balanced to make the game more enjoyable. Killstreaks have been removed from Black Ops II and replaced with score streaks; Any major action in Black Ops II multiplayer earns score for you.\n\nEvery pre-order on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC will be given the free \"Nuketown: 2025\" bo2 multiplayer map, a remake of the classic Nuketown map. BO2 is set for release on November 13th, 2012.\n\nRezurrection is the latest and final map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops. It's available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. The Rezurrection DLC was an Xbox Live Marketplace exclusive for 30 days, but it was later released for the PS3 and PC.\n\nRezurrection is available for 1200 Microsoft Points / $15, but players that have purchased the Black Ops Hardened or Prestige Editions will get the DLC for free. The DLC includes a new zombie map named Moon, four re-mastered classic maps: Nacht der Untoten, VerrÃ¼ckt, Shi No Numa, Der Riese and an enhanced soundtrack.\n\nObliterate the competition with Annihilation, the newest downloadable map pack for Black Ops, with four brand new multiplayer maps and one new zombie map. The Annihilation DLC map pack costs 1200 Microsoft Points / $15.\n\nDrive-In\n\nFeatures close-quarter fights and powerful overwatches at an abandoned outdoor cinema. The map has some sniping positions, but is very small and favours close-quarters combat.\n\nHangar 18\n\nLocated in a highly classified U.S. facility where you will fight through experimental weapons labs, the SR-71 test hangar and a mysterious autopsy room.\n\nHazard\n\nThis multiplayer map takes place on a cliffside golf course. Keep an eye out for snipers as you battle up and down the fairway.\n\nSilo\n\nLocated in a massive Soviet nuclear missile site, that's under construction. This huge map has lots of close engagements and flank routes.\n\nShangri-La\n\nThis zombie map takes place in a legendary shrine lost in an exotic jungle, where the undead lurk within a treacherous labyrinth of underground caverns, deadly traps and dark secrets.\n\nThe Annihilation map pack is available on Xbox 360 (Xbox LIVE), PlayStation 3 (PSN) and PC (Steam).\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is being developed by Infinity Ward and assisted by Raven Software and Sledgehammer Games; Raven Software will be co-working on the multiplayer. Modern Warfare 3 (abbreviated as MW3) runs at 60 FPS to give it a competitive edge. MW3 will be the first Call of Duty game to have built-in support for color-blind gamers. On the singleplayer side, MW3 will immediately follow the events of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.\n\nMost of the Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer perks will be new, but some old favourites are still in. Overpowered perks, such as the Commando and Last Stand are removed from the mw3 perks due to balance issues. Familiar weapons from both Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops are to make a comeback in the mw3 weapons arsenal; the weapons have been completely re-designed and balanced for multiplayer.\n\nMW3's multiplayer will not be relying that much on killstreaks and focuses more on fast-paced, gun-on-gun gameplay. Compared to previous Call of Duty games, the mw3 killstreaks system has been completely revamped. The game should also feature a total of 20 new multiplayer maps, but it's expected that some of the mw3 multiplayer maps might be left out of the final version and sold later in map packs.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (MW3) will be released on 8th of November, 2011.\n\nThe Escalation map pack features four all-new multiplayer maps and one new zombie map. It's out on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC; it costs 1200 Microsoft Points, which is about $15.\n\nConvoy\n\nThe Convoy multiplayer map delivers intense, close-quarters combat at the scene of an ambushed US military convoy somewhere in California.\n\nHotel\n\nTakes place on the roof of a Cuban luxury hotel and casino. The map has three usable elevators that move between two floors. There are a lot of large open areas, but also smaller rooms and staircases, which promotes camping.\n\nStockpile\n\nStockpile is located in a suburban village housing secret WMD facilities, pretty much like in the COD: Ghosts remake. There is a building with two large steel doors that can be opened and closed with switches.\n\nZoo\n\nMedium sized map in an abandoned Soviet Russian Zoo, with danger at every turn.\n\nCall of the Dead\n\nLarge zombie map set in a mysterious ice-covered remote Siberian island, with multiple areas.\n\nThe First Strike map pack is now available for all three formats: Xbox 360 (Xbox LIVE), PlayStation 3 (PSN) and PC (Steam). It costs 1200 MS Points / $15.\n\nThe First Strike includes four new multiplayer maps and one new zombie map:\n\nBerlin Wall\n\nA medium-large map set around Check-Point Charlie in Berlin during the Cold War. There are automatic turrets that fire anyone that dares to go near them. This multiplayer map is ideal for snipers and campers.\n\nDiscovery\n\nTakes place in an abandoned German outpost set along the coast of Antarctica. The map has close-range and long-range firefights.\n\nKowloon\n\nThe map is located in the city of Kowloon, Hong Kong; the map is suited for all types of combat. There are two zip-lines in the map that can be used to travel from one side to the other.\n\nStadium\n\nTakes place in a sports complex called Chance Stadium. Killstreaks are not completely usable on this map, but in the Ghosts remake, it's safe to say that many of the cod: ghosts kill streaks can be used due to the next-gen engine. The map delivers fast-paced, close-quarters combat with light cover everywhere.\n\nAscension\n\nThe map is located in an abandoned Soviet Cosmodrome, where players will fight against hoards of vicious, perk-stealing zombie monkeys, flesh-eating Soviet zombies and more! The objective is to survive for as long as possible against limitless waves of zombies.\n\nActivision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops has grossed $650 million within its first five days on sale worldwide. This beats last years Modern Warfare 2 by over $100 million. Call of Duty has become the first entertainment property in history to set five-day launch records for two consecutive years across all forms of entertainment, and is expected to rise to three consecutive years after Call of Duty: MW3 is released.\n\nOver 2.6 million unique gamers logged 5.9 million multiplayer hours on Xbox LIVE on 9th of November. The game was also a tremendous success on the PlayStation 3.\n\nBlack Ops has also set new sales records in the United Kingdom; Two million copies of the game were sold in five days, beating the previous record holder, Modern Warfare 2, by over 10 percent. The Xbox 360 was the best selling version of Call of Duty: Black Ops in the game's opening week. Out of the 2 million sold copies in the UK, 55 percent were Xbox 360 versions and 42 percent PlayStation 3. The PC, DS and Wii versions took the remaining 3 percent."
