        "text": "Yes, I realized that the moment I hit submit.\n\nOn topic: Skyrim could benefit a ton from tesselation on all those trees, bushes, flowers, etc. Yet, they didn't because as long as it is playable, people just don't care. The only benefit, really, is higher average FPS.\n\nSkyrim can be so much better with DX11, but they didn't and still managed to produce such a good game (well, at least according to the reviews and fanbase anyway). I would rather see Skyrim in DX11 than COD with DX11, setting everything at max and watch the slideshow (the best my pc can do lol) of weather changing from the top of a mountain.\n\nSkyrim has a very poor data save system, the game slows to a crawl when your savefile becomes too big (and has nothing to do with the graphics). That needs to be fixed before TES VI\n\nPeople can pull analogies up with other companies all they want, but the major difference will always be as follows. Each year Activision releases a game, that is basically identical to their last. The development time is about 12-16 months, and the game hardly changes from the previous entry whichever development studio made.\n\nYou look at companies like Bethesda, they went from Oblivion to Fallout 3, which have similar gameplay elements, and run on the same engine, but they are nothing alike. They are both games that you can sink hundreds of hours into as single-player adventures. The games Bethesda made took a couple years for each team to develop, and each one introduced quite a few new elements, either to gameplay or visuals.\n\nSure, Engines are just code, but they must have limitations as time goes by--inabilities to adequately multi-thread, poor resource usage, etc. There is always improvement to be made, and if you could just get by with heavily modifying your last engine, why do Epic and id keep releasing new and better engines?\n\nIt boils down to a simple question: is it worth fundamentally changing the engine to support Direct3D 10/10.1/11 features or are we okay with what we can do without? Answer is always the later unless you commoditize the engine (like Epic and id software).\n\n^^ This is why Epic and Id create new engines all the time. It makes them money.\n\nThey haven't made a new engine because they do not have the talent in house with Treyarch to do so. Treyarch is living off the scraps of IW original crew.\n\nPerhaps, but the \"scraps\" are feeding them pretty well, no?\n\nDon't get me wrong, TMM, I'm all for new tech in both hardware and software, but if from a business standpoint a major investment will not result in a better ROI (because they are already selling tons) then would it be a high priority? No, it wouldn't and that's how they obviously view it.\n\nSkyrim used a heavily modified Morrowind Engine and that is about 10 years old, so I guess I am fine with this decision.\n\nBut Quake 3 Arena engine is much older. It is very limited in terms of what you can really do with it compared to engines nowadays. They have heavily modified it to this point but the foundation is still crap.\n\nBlack Ops 2 will just be a rehash with better graphics. You can do better effects but the core gameplay will not change because they are limited via the engine itself.\n\nAll this time taken using this crappy archaic engine should have been done developing their own engine while the crappy engine brought in the development funds. Now DICE is at 2.0+ on Frostbite and CoD can only keep rehashing.\n\nBut Treyarch chief Mark Lamia said continuing to upgrade the current engine was enough to meet the development team's design goals. \"People always ask me, 'Is this a new engine?' he told One of Swords. \"I liken it to people who live in an older house that has been remodelled. Just because you're remodelling the house and it will look new or it will have a new kitchen, you don't tear out the foundation, or break out some of the framing. You might even go as hardcore as replacing the plumbing, and we will do that sort of thing, as an analogy. It's a gross simplification, but it's one way to say that. There's a lot of good still in that foundation that you wouldn't get rid of, and we don't. We look to advance in the areas that support our game design.\n\nSo what happens when the wood frame holding up the house is rotting? Do you keep putting up wall paper to hope people won't notice?\n\nIt's not a problem of remolding. It's a problem of the house rotting to the ground. Then sticking wall paper over the holes and celebrating at how much better it looks. :shadedshu"
