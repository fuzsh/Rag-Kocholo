Work is being done to populate the wiki with information and tutorials so stay tuned!\n\nFor titles using Ricochet, Cordycep must be used to extract assets.\n\nWindows 10 x64 or above (Windows 7/8/8.1 should work, but are untested)\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2017 Runtime (x86 and x64)\n\nOfficial copies of the games (only the latest copies from official distributors are tested)\n\nThe following tools/plugins are required/recommended for some assets/games:\n\nCast by DTZxPorter (.cast) (Autodesk Maya/Blender)\n\nSETools by DTZxPorter (.seanim & .semodel) (Autodesk Maya)\n\nio_anim_seanim by SE2Dev (.seanim) (Blender)\n\nio_model_semodel by DTZxPorter (.semodel) (Blender)\n\nFileTypeDDS by DTZxPorter (support in Paint .NET for newer DXGI formats) (Paint .NET)\n\nIntel TextureWorks by Intel (DDS + Utils) (Photoshop)\n\nDarkIris by DTZxPorter (Texture Utils) (Paint .NET)\n\nLinks:\n\nGithub Repo: Link\n\nChange Log: Link\n\nLatest Release: Link\n\nGreyhound, like Wraith Archon and the WraithX Library, is licensed under the General Public License 3.0, you are free to use Greyhound, both it and its source code, under the terms of the GPL.

These tools are developed to allow users access to assets for use in other Call of Duty SDKs (such as the Black Ops III Mod Tools) and for use in 3D art such as YouTube thumbnails, etc. The assets extracted by these tools are property of their respective owners and what you do with the assets is your own responsbility.\n\nGreyhound is distributed with an automatic updater that will check for updates each time the application is launched by requesting the releases data via the Github API. If you do not wish for Greyhound to check for updates you can simply delete the Greyhound Updater executable.\n\nGreyhound was originally made by DTZxPorter and ID Daemon as Wraith Archon, forked and maintained since 2018 by Scobalula, and now maintained by dest1yo."
