        "text": "Paul David Nuñez June 26th, 2019 - 9:52 PM\n\nKotaku’s Jason Schreier published a report today detailing the issues of contract employees during the development of Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4. Current and former staff members describe a “company in which contractors, and particularly testers feel like they’re perceived and treated as inferior.”\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 4 was a very successful game, as most Call of Duty titles are. But, “it was also a turbulent production, marked by a drastic reboot, the last-minute addition of a battle royale mode, and what one developer described as “perpetual crunch” that perhaps hit the QA team hardest.” The crunch that occurred during Black Ops 4 wasn’t suppose to be as severe. Black Ops 3 went through a similar issue, also getting rebooted midway through production. Black Ops 3 was suppose to feature an open world, but it got scrapped for the typical traditional linear campaign which caused Treyarch employees to make up for all the lost work. One former employee said “For this to happen twice… the morale drop that happened in the studio can’t be understated. They’d been promised, ‘After Black Ops 3, we’re not going to do that again. We’re not going to scrap all this work that you’ve been putting in.'”\n\nThis leads to Black Ops 4 which went through changes for different reasons, including the 2v2 campaign idea not coming together and Red Dead Redemption II. “People were saying: ‘How can we do this, create an entirely new campaign that takes everything we’ve put in this other mode that was unsuccessful, and still tells our story.'” This leads to Blackout, the battle royale mode, that was created to replace the campaign. “Now we have an even shorter amount of time to put in work on a new mode,” a developer told Kotaku. “Actual development work on Blackout didn’t start until nine months before launch. That mode came together by the seat of its pants. It’s kind of a miracle that it did.” On top of that, Activision decided to shift the release of Black Ops 4 to October 12, ahead of Red Dead Redemption II, which was one month earlier than the planned original release of November. This lead to employees of Treyarch spending most of 2018 crunching to complete development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4."
