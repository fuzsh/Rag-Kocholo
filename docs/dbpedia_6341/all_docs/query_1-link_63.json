        "text": "I still enjoy Call of Duty still but when they merged every game together with massive downloads and lots of space required I kinda just stopped buying them. Last game I played was Cold War which I got with my PS5. Shame because I really liked the campaigns.\n\nHigh budget but will still suck, call of duty is one of the worst game series i have ever played, every game is a downgrade over the last, I don't care what anyone says black ops 4 was the best one since ghosts which was also great.\n\nTwo games that were wrongly lambasted when they had solid netcode and great features like the character customisation and cool abilities like healing your whole team with crash.\n\nI wish they would use a new game engine. This yet again tweaked source engine ran game is getting so old now it's a joke that it's still being rolled out. Yes it works and it's smooth as hell etc but it's so out dated. More investment in a new engine that uses current gen to it's full potential should be a must going forwards. I also wish they would reduce the install size as its just bloated beyond belief. Think I'll pass...\n\n@Deityjester\n\n\"call of duty is one of the worst game series i have ever played, every game is a downgrade over the last\"\n\nTell me you never beat a single game in the franchise without telling me you never beat a single game in the franchise\n\n@Flaming_Kaiser it cracks me up when people come on here and are like \"I'll play it on GamePass\"\n\nI've seen more edge on Crayola safety scissors!\n\n@Killionaire if you're referring to me, I am perfectly capable of subscribing to GamePass on my Series X, thank you.\n\nI don't know why I would be jealous of someone paying to play CoD\n\n@Killionaire if I felt the day one games on GamePass were worth it, I'd subscribe. It's certainly not worth it for their first party titles.\n\nI had GPU for free for 4 months and I still played my PS5 more."
