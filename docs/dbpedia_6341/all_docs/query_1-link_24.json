        "text": "New Buildable Equipment are now available in the new Zombies Game Modes. So far, they can be created on Green Run / TranZit and on Die Rise.\n\nBuildables are created by picking up parts around the map and assembling it at a worktable, workbench, blue print table, whatever you like to call it. The work table will look like a regular wooden work bench with a blue print above it. There will be more than one work bench on a map. This is because only a certain item can be built on that specific work bench. If you have parts to another item, you may have to find another workd bench.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe items built can be weapons or equipment. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time by a player.\n\nIf the player is downed or killed while carrying either a part or completed piece of equipment, it will drop wherever they went down. If a player wants to pick up a second buildable piece of equipment, they will drop the first item next to where they picked up the second item. If it was a weapon a player got rid of, it may appear once again in the Mystery Box.\n\nTranZit Buildables\n\nThe following items are available only on the map Green Run. See the Green Run page for more info on the entire map.\n\nTurbine\n\nThe first piece of equipment that can be built is at the Bus Depot, the Turbine. The turbine uses a fan to create wind power. Drop these at several doors to open them, or use them with other buildables to power them. The Turbine can also be set next to a Perk-A-Cola Machine to buy a perk, but the perk will not be active until the power is turned on in the map.\n\nParts Location Fan Seats Mannequin Near Sign Tail Fin Near Phones and Lockers\n\nZombie Shield\n\nThe next buildable piece of equipment is a Zombie Shield, similar to an Assault Shield. This item is built at the second stop, the Rest Stop. Using the shield will not earn you points.\n\nParts Location Car Door Garage next to Gas Station Dolly Diner\n\nTurret\n\nThe third item is the turret. This item can be built at the third stop, the Farm. The turret will automatically fire at any zombies in front of it. Unfortunately, this item will not work unless a Turbine is set next to it.\n\nParts Location Lawnmower Outside House or in Barn Machine Gun Outside House or in Barn Ammo Pouch In House\n\nPower Switch\n\nThe fourth buildable is the power switch. This is the same old power switch that has been in many previous zombies maps. Turning on the power will release Him and turn on all Perk-A-Colas. This item is built in the power lab at the fourth stop.\n\nParts Location Zombie Hand In Power Lab Lever (Power Switch) In Power Lab Power Board In Power Lab\n\nElectric Trap\n\nThe fifth buildable is an Electric Trap that injuries and kills zombies. To use it, a Turbine must be set down next to it. This item is built in the burned building next to the power lab at the fourth stop.\n\nParts Location Board with Poles In Demolished Building Car Light Bulb In Demolished Building Battery In Demolished Building\n\nPack-A-Punch Machine\n\nThe Pack-A-Punch Machine can be built at the fifth stop inside the Bank. To access it, a player must use the turbine near the door at the beginning of the Power Lab (Fourth stop). A door will open in the bank's safe with all the parts.\n\nParts Location Battery In Bank Safe Secret Room Table In Bank Safe Secret Room Pack-A-Punch Sign In Bank Safe Secret Room\n\nThrustodyne Aeronautics Model 23\n\nAnother buildable item is a special weapon. This weapon can only be built at the fifth stop in the bar. The weapon is called the Thrustodyne Aeronautics Model 23. It sucks in enemies and shreds them into pieces. After using it a few times, it will break. Only one can wield it.\n\nIf the Thrustodyne Aeronautics model 23 breaks, players may not be able to rebuild it in the same match. This has not been 100% confirmed.\n\nParts Location Wires Near the Electric Trap Jet Engine In Tunnel (Between Bus Depot and Rest Stop) Gauge In Cabin (Between Power Lab and Town) Handle In Nacht Der Untoten building beyond Corn Maze (Between Farm and Power Lab)\n\nPart of the Tower of Babble Easter Egg. It can be built up against the right side of the fence, under the electrical tower (or pylon, if you will) in the corn maze opposite Nacht Der Untoten. Currently, no Navcard works when you are given the option to insert the one you picked up behind Bus Depot.\n\nParts Location Element 115 In hole in wall beside mystery box location at the Bus Depot Control Panel In demolished building (Nacht Der Untoten) in corn maze between stops three and four. Wooden Board Under the stairs by the work bench at Power Lab / Demolished Building Control Panel 2 Leaning against dumpster beside mystery box location in the Town (Area 5).\n\nDie Rise Buildables\n\nThe following items are available only on the map Die Rise. See the Die Rise page for more info on the entire map.\n\nTrample Steam\n\nThe Trample Steam is a new piece of equipment that can fling zombies off a building, or it can be used to fling players from one building to the next.\n\nYou will need four parts scattered around the starting room or the next hall around the M14 on Die Rise. The four parts are a flag, engine, square chain-link board, and bellows. See the images below:\n\nBuild all these parts on a workbench with a blue print above it. The bench will be located two floors below the starting area, near the B23R. You must take the Quick Revive or Speed Cola Elevator to reach this side of the room. This device lasts awhile, so just leave it on the ground and circle a horde over it every time it winds up.\n\nSliquifier\n\nThe Sliquifier is a new buildable weapon in Die Rise. To create it you must gather four parts that are scattered throughout the second building (the building with the power switch). They are usually in or around the sewing room. The pieces are a grip, a circular device, a mannequin foot, and a small, red propane tank. Assemble them all on the workbench one floor beneath the sewing room.\n\nHeadchopper\n\nBelow are images of the parts for the Headchopper. It will slice any Zombies that come near it. The parts don't have true names, but they look like a big blade, a crank, a wooden platform of some sort, and a chain gear like a bicycle's pedal gear.\n\nSubsurface Resonator\n\nBelow are images of the parts for the Subsurface Resonator. It will send a sonic boom that will kill any Zombies in front of it. Kill ten zombies with this equipment to unlock the Death From Below achievement / trophy. The parts don't have true names, but they look like a card playing table, a roulette wheel, a speaker, and a generator of some kind."
