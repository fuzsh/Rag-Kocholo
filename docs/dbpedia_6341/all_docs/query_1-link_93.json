        "text": "Rebirth Island returns to Call of Duty®: Warzone™, an iconic fan-favorite map that favors nonstop action across 11 major Points of Interest (POIs). In this iteration of the prison island, the Konni Group has taken over, repurposing its infrastructure for research and development.\n\nWhether it’s your first time deploying to Rebirth Island or you’re a veteran of the island, it’s well worth taking the time to explore each of its major POIs. This guide details each one, and you may be surprised to find what’s changed compared to the map’s previous installments. Discover the best vantage points, ambush spots, escape routes, and more, from the central Prison to the whole perimeter of the island.\n\nBioweapons is a three-story brick and steel building, one of the tallest on the north end of the island. From the main road, a set of double doors and an open garage leads into the loading area; a single door offers access to a workroom and the metal staircase leading to the upper floors. Operators can also head down into the basement, a small area stored with hazardous materials and a ripe location for ambushes.\n\nFor those seeking heights, the rooftop offers a commanding view of the island’s northwest corner, with long sightlines toward Industry, the hilltop and water tower outside of the Prison, and the Chemical Engineering factory. A great place to make a stand, the roof is accessible from interior and exterior stairs. If you need a quick escape, take the zipline over to the rooftop of Chemical Engineering.\n\nThe first floor has three rooms: the loading area, the main workroom, and the interior stairwell. The loading area looks out onto the Industry building and the street below; within, take the staircase down to the basement or enter the central workroom. Note the multiple exit points in the back of the room offering access to the concrete walkway, the exterior staircase, and the white shed and jetty.\n\nThe second floor features two adjacent supply rooms peppered with open windows proving the opportunity to eliminate enemies moving in toward the building. The exterior staircase is easily accessible here, great for getting out of sight in a pinch.\n\nThe third floor leads to the laboratory, a large area with more substantial cover than the floors below. There are two windows providing long views over the main road to the north and south, an ideal vantage point for sharpshooters looking to eliminate enemies on the move.\n\nThe low-lying Industry building sits adjacent to the main road circling the island, its roof nearly level with the hilltop. Its position between the Prison and the island’s north end makes it a popular spot that often sees high activity. A row of doors and other openings along the building’s side can be used to access the first floor, and an exterior staircase leads to the second level and a ladder up to the roof, a flat surface with several vantage points looking down into the building.\n\nAn alley runs between the building and the hilltop, offering a means to flank enemies along with a central staircase giving access to the water tower. The bridge on the building’s southeastern leads to a shed and a road that travels toward the Prison.\n\nEntering from the northeast end of the building leads to a storage room on the ground floor and a research lab on the second level. Don’t miss the side room accessible from both floors that leads into a tunnel which cuts under the road to the front of Chemical Engineering.\n\nHead into the larger warehouse to engage in long-ranged interior fights. The upper warehouse walkway is ideal for defending the area, providing a clear view of any movement below.\n\nThe hilltop at the back of Industry features a helipad near several sheds, one of them accessible with several windows providing views over the Industry rooftop and toward Chemical Engineering. So long as you’re not in the line of sight of anyone looking over the area, the hilltop marks a good pivot point between the north and south paths of the main road.\n\nSet low on the shoreline, Chemical Engineering is easily identified by the smokestack rising from its roof and the bright orange and white paint of its outer walls.\n\nHead below street level to reach the first floor, either by taking one of the available staircases or hopping over the concrete wall. Note the tunnel found in the landing area here that leads back to Industry and a smaller one that heads to the building’s parking area.\n\nMantle up to the roof from the building’s north end to reach its higher points, including the smokestack and ventilation area leading and a doorway leading back into the main factory. Alternatively, stay low to reach a concrete jetty and a wraparound walkway underneath two waste pipes — note the ascender leading from the water into the mouth of one for a shortcut into the building.\n\nThe main factory floor is an L-shaped room built around massive red tanks and a small incline up to a row of control systems. A smaller adjoining room can be reached through the double doors to the north, while the room due south through the archway holds another massive container set around a double staircase. Exit from this room to reach the building’s wraparound walkway, a ladder up to the roof, and stairs descending to the shoreline.\n\nA work shed in this area marks another available interior space. Although the room is small and has little of note, it does offer views over the walkway below and toward Bioweapons.\n\nSouth of the main factory, the building marked ‘07’ on the outside is a major draw for players looking to stock up on supplies and engage in combat across multiple levels. Entry into the building is largely divided between the upper levels accessible via ramps from the street or the lower parking area accessible from the landing area and wraparound walkway along the shoreline. Each level is wide open with little cover other than some small side rooms with ambush potential.\n\nAccessible via ladder on the top floor, the office’s pitched roof offers commanding views of the Harbor, hilltop, Industry, and Bioweapons.\n\nThe northern Dock sweeps through most of the northern shoreline and is largely divided by the power station and its center point.\n\nSouth of the station, a long stone staircase passes under an anti-aircraft gun and leads up to the bluffs overlooking the docked freighter and a helipad. Past the freighter, cannons line the shore all the way to the southern Stronghold.\n\nNorth of the power station, massive concrete infrastructure slopes down to the shoreline toward a mid-sized two-story building connected via zipline to the roof of Industry. Head to the second floor and its balcony for a good mid-ranged vantage point or climb the ladder to the roof for a broader though more exposed view.\n\nJutting out into the water, the power room sits on an elevated concrete structure that offers commanding views along the Dock and over the main road passing nearby. Aside from a shack that can be used to ambush or escape enemy players, the single accessible room up here holds some power equipment, including a large white generator that nearly divides the room in two.\n\nA small walkway overlooks the dangerous waters below, and a metal catwalk descends to the northern side of the structure. Jump into the water here to find an accessible pipe you can swim through to exit out onto the ground floor of the northern Dock. For an overland escape, use the zipline to quickly transition toward or onto the freighter.\n\nA large freighter is docked and accessible for exploration. The freighter’s deck sits in full view of the nearby gun emplacements, so beware of enemy Operators attacking from above. Move down the ramp or head into the bridge to get out sight, offering different levels of verticality depending on your current needs. To get up really high, climb the ladder up to the top of the foremast and get sniping\n\nThe Control Center features a larger building connected to a smaller one via breezeway. The main building has a rooftop in plain sight of the Prison roof and lighthouse. When attacking enemies below, use the large radar structure and rooftop access point to cover your back. Note the ascender here, too, which can be used to descend from the roof should you need a quick escape.\n\nThe main cell block is clustered across four hallways providing long sightlines and plenty of opportunities for close-ranged fights. The wider center floor offers some more breathing room in the otherwise confined setting. Note the accessible cells throughout; they’re optimal ambush points. The library on the north end leads to an additional row of cells, a stairwell within granting access to the upper level.\n\nThe main cell block catwalk is easily accessible via several entryways and climbing spots, offering a strong view over the action below. Like the first floor, there are numerous open cells that serve as ambush points here.\n\nThe cafeteria on the Prison’s northeast end opens up into a wide room with some mid-sized pillars for cover within. A corner locker room and the kitchen alcoves in the back do provide a means to disrupt sight lines and stage an ambush against incoming enemies; be aware of foes doing the same upon entering.\n\nTake the stairs near the front of the cafeteria to reach the infirmary above, consisting of a long central hallway with smaller rooms on either side all the way down. Note the descending staircase at the start of the hallway that leads to the main cell block catwalk and the ascending staircase at the end of the hallway that goes up to the roof.\n\nPreceded by a courtyard separating the Prison from Headquarters, the warden’s entrance is accessible from the front doorway here or via several exterior entry points.\n\nThe small lobby is suited to close-quarters combat, branching to the left and right toward various filing rooms and a holding cell. Continue past the check-in counter to head straight into the main cell block. Cut right before heading through the door to ascend the stairs up to the roof; go left to take another set of stairs up to the main cell block’s catwalk.\n\nThe Prison basement features the showers and a small electrical room. The showers are accessible from several different exterior entry points, including a flight of stairs descending from the main cell block. Inside, a long half wall separates two troughs of shower stalls. The corner changing area gives some coverage from the otherwise open space. The electrical room serves as a hallway connected to the showers, a flash point for close-quarters combat.\n\nNote the doorway in the showers leading down into a tunnel that runs straight out toward the northern Dock. A ladder at the start of the tunnel offers access back up to the surface.\n\nThe flat Prison rooftop looks over the whole island. Since it’s such a large area, there is always the danger of being ambushed while looking out over the sides. Though the 360-degree views provide solid command of the surrounding environment, you’ll need to hop on top of the low surrounding walls to get a view downward, thus exposing yourself to counter-snipes. Long-range weaponry is heavily encouraged here.\n\nThe central roof is divided by four rows of skylights, with several openings providing access to the inner Prison. Also at center is a small ramp leading up to the tram platform which shuttles back and forth between here and the southern Harbor.\n\nThe water tower next to the yard in the Prison’s northwest corner serves as Rebirth Island’s main landmark and is a phenomenal watchpoint. Survive the climb up the exposed ladder or take the ascender for two levels of commanding 360-degree vantage points. Climb the ladder up to the very top of the water tower to enjoy the one of the highest vantage points on the map, rivaled only by the ligthouse in Headquarters.\n\nThe dirt yard below features a few popup tents, vehicles, and supplies, though otherwise it’s an open mid-ranged field. Climb a ladder to one of the perimeter guard towers for access to the raised walkway surrounding the yard. This is a fantastic area to land some eliminations against enemies toward the prison and the Dock, with a zipline that will take you to the roof of Industry and walkways that turn back toward the Prison and wrap around the water tower.\n\nThe southern Harbor stretches along the center of the southern shoreline between Chemical Engineering to the north and Factory to the south. A concrete walkway provides quick traversal across the area, with several smaller buildings giving the opportunity to disappear and set up a vantage point over the area. The lower tram platform sits between Harbor and Factory, offering a ride straight up to the Prison rooftop.\n\nSandwiched between the Factory tram line and the brick office building, the Harbor warehouse is defined by two floors that have no interior connection points. It is mostly barren with few cover pieces inside. Walk along the Harbor to find a recess created by four brick pillars and a staircase leading up to the first floor. You can also climb up a stack of crates nearby to reach the first floor through the open window.\n\nA white brick hallway pierces through the first floor that aligns with the outer service road. To reach the second level, climb the stone staircase up from the dirt path on the north side, leading to a brick-walled office space with one window that looks out toward the communications office and the power station. From this room you can hop onto the roof, which is about level with the road and provides a great sightline into the tram while docked at the nearby station.\n\nJust outside the communications office is the orange and black power station, a two-story structure with a turbine and generators that help power the island. The upstairs room is a confined space with blocked out windows, but the ground floor offers a bit more room to maneuver. Note the ladder near the turbine which descends into a water filled concrete pipe that you can swim through to multiple exit points, offering a great opportunity to reposition and flank unsuspecting enemies.\n\nThe lighthouse is the primary lookout spot within the Headquarters area, one of the two highest vantage points available alongside the opposing water tower. Because it sits so close to the warden’s entrance to the Prison, it’s prone to high traffic; expect close-quarters action inside as Operators battle for control of the tower’s phenomenal views over the island.\n\nReaching the tower requires climbing the ladder found through the building’s doorway positioned closest to the Prison. Turn into the building’s first floor to reach the remnants of a living space with a kitchen, sitting room, study, and library, all confined areas where close-quarters combat flourishes.\n\nThe second floor leads to a tight cluster of office spaces and restrooms. Access the L-shaped roof from the ladder that climbs up to the tower, taking the door at the first landing on the way up. This area provides good views within the greater Headquarters area while maintaining a lower profile compared to the top of the lighthouse.\n\nThis two-story command center offers great views of the surrounding Headquarters area as well as down toward the Living Quarters and Factory, the Prison rooftop, and for snipers, the distant Stronghold.\n\nThe first floor wraps around a central wall and a single staircase leads to the upper level, featuring a circular layout with several branching rooms. Several climbing points around the outside of the building offer direct access to this upper level, as well as some ladders leading up to the roof.\n\nA two-story home with a basement used to act as temporary quarters for those stationed on the island. Inside, a once comfortable living space offers decent views over the surrounding area. Climb up to the roof for a more substantial view; use its steep pitch as cover to limit your exposure. With a running jump, you can reach the command center’s ladder leading up to the roof.\n\nNote the twisting network of staircases near the garrison that leads down to the main road and the factory beyond.\n\nThe Factory is the largest feature on the southwestern shoreline, a commanding three-story building and basement that all come together to encourage multi-level, close-quarters combat. Given the views toward Harbor and proximity to Headquarters, Factory sees plenty of traffic.\n\nDoors and windows line the exterior of the white building, but many of them are closed off. Exterior walkways stretch along the first and second floor, offering additional means to enter the building and to fire down toward the Harbor with an unobstructed view. Two ladder systems on the second-floor catwalk and two ascenders provide quick access to the Factory’s rooftop.\n\nThe roof is split into two pieces: a mostly flat blacktop with some scattered cover points and an entry back into the building, and a pitched roof offering higher views. Both sides offer great sightlines toward the shoreline below and are level with the stairs that climb up to the Headquarters and Prison.\n\nThe first floor features a couple control rooms, a restroom, and storage by the rear entry points. An ascending stairwell gives access to the second and third floors, while a descending one winds down to the basement.\n\nThe second floor extends from the middle staircase to a small landing with two side doors. One leads to a bare storage area that exits out to the rear staircases, while the other opens onto three small control rooms with exit points to the rear and front of the building. Offering just the stairwell landing, the third floor is more of a pivot point leading up to the roof or out back onto the main road.\n\nGo down into the Factory’s underbelly to reach a long concrete hallway with mid-sized storage rooms along its side and exit points back to the surface on either end, plus a staircase leading back up to the building’s first floor.\n\nOne of the lowest lying areas on the map, the dockside offers a straight, flat route under the shadow of the Factory. Alongside scattered cover objects, this area includes a crane, tower, and tram station platform, and a docked freighter.\n\nClimb up onto the crane for an unconventional view against enemies below or on the Factory’s exterior walkways. From the freighter’s deck, you can also hop into the open yellow container for a lower, more concealed vantage point.\n\nNorth of the crane, the tower is accessible via a ladder from the ground or by jumping from the concrete stairs up to the tram station. If possible, fire from within the upper tower’s low walls for some added cover.\n\nThe Harbor-side freighter offers a larger top deck compared to the one in Dock, offering the possibility of mid-ranged fights to break out across the deck. The bridge offers the only accessible interior portion of the ship, though its several levels provide options for various playstyles. As with the other ship, don’t miss the ladder climbing up to the main mast, a vantage point useful to snipers and for those looking to parachute away from the area.\n\nA set of four apartments in an assortment of colors completes the row of Living Quarters. Each has a color and letter that corresponds to them: A (teal), B (orange), C (grey), and D (red).\n\nA & B: Living Quarters A and B have nearly identical layouts. From the main entrance, Living Quarters A contains a small mudroom and a door to the living and kitchen area. Through an archway lies a hallway with a door to the bathroom, a ladder up to the roof, and a staircase down to the two bedrooms.\n\nC & D: Though consisting of a different layout than the first two buildings, Living Quarters C and D also consist of a similar floorplan, including a mudroom that opens onto the living and kitchen room combo with a staircase ascending to the second-floor study.\n\nA sprawling network of tents, prefab medical units, and a small office building all sit at the base of the crags leading up toward Headquarters. Lying between the main road that circles the island and a crossroad up the hill, the base camp is a good place to get off the road and get out of sight when being pursued.\n\nThe single-room office across from Living Quarters No. 9 is peppered with windows that can be used for targeting incoming enemies, as well as a ladder leading up to the roof, offering a slight advantage over those in the vicinity.\n\nBetween the Stronghold and Living Quarters are some staircases and dirt paths leading down to the lower road. Note the storage room near the switchbacks and the jetty accessible just off the road. If you’re not in the mood for a hike, take the zipline near the gun emplacement down to the crane by Stronghold.\n\nThe construction site at the entrance of Stronghold offers ample cover points including the metal-sheeted chain link fence, gas tank, building supplies, the front guard room, and the parked trucks. With some careful climbing, it’s possible to get a commanding view over the area by climbing up to the top of the nearby yellow crane.\n\nThe primary checkpoint building features a raised central walkway connecting the two-story wings with a garage and filing room attached at the ends. Prepare for close quarters combat within either side, sectioned into various confined office and control rooms. For mid-ranged combat, head to the second-floor walkway or the balcony looking toward the roundabout from the garage side building.\n\nThose seeking higher sightlines should climb up to the roof, also connected by the top of the walkway. Crouch down by the low surrounding wall when attacking from here to minimize your exposure to return fire.\n\nThe rear roundabout offers plentiful tactical opportunities. The scattered cover objects alone provide significant cover, with the green warehouse and storage room granting overhead cover when you need to escape attacks incoming from the checkpoint or satellite tower.\n\nClimb to the top of the tower for the most commanding view of the immediate area. There are three different levels of elevation available on the way up, so pick the one that best caters to your current weapons.\n\nAt the rear corners of Stronghold, you’ll find an accessible gun emplacement on the north end and a small shed and helipad on the south end. And if things ever start going downhill, you can always jump onto the rocks by the shoreline and reposition to a better location."
