        "text": "Image Quality and System requirements\n\nVisual Image Quality\n\nBlack Ops III will use a heavily modified version of the IW engine used previously in Black Ops II. This will be the second game to benefit under publisher Activision's three-year development cycle, the first being Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. The cycle allows each of the development teams of the Call of Duty series (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games) to develop games in a three-year timespan, as opposed to the two allowed previously. At first sight, the game is an undeniably impressive leap in terms of aesthetics, with hover-bikes, mobile barricades, plus an exoskeleton suit allowing for jet-powered strafes and double-jumps. An in-game holographic HUD is also added, as flaunted by the studio's earlier work on Dead Space, removing the traditional overlays to show remaining ammo on the rifle itself. It's a stylish touch that fits nicely with a future setting.\n\nCall of Duty will run on 64-bit only with Windows 7 or 8. The PC version of the shooter will require at least a Intel Core i3-530 @ 2.93 GHz / AMD Phenom II X4 810 @ 2.60 GHz. Minimum VGA requirements are a NVIDIA GeForce GTS 450 @ 1GB / ATI® Radeon HD 5870 @ 1GB. Also this one, 6 GB system memory ?\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nOS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit / Windows 8.1 64-Bit / Windows 10 64-Bit / Windows 10 64-Bit\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i3-530 @ 2.93 GHz / AMD Phenom II X4 810 @ 2.60 GHz\n\nMemory: 6 GB RAM\n\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTS 470 @ 1GB / AMD Radeon HD 6970 @ 1GB\n\nDirectX: Version 11\n\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\n\nHard Drive: 55 GB available space\n\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\n\nRecommended System Requirements\n\nOS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit / Windows 8.1 64-Bit / Windows 10 64-Bit / Windows 10 64-Bit\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-2500K @ 3.30GHz\n\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\n\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 760 @ 4GB / AMD Radeon HD 270X 4GB\n\nDirectX: Version 11\n\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\n\nHard Drive: 55 GB available space\n\nSound Card: 100% DirectX 9.0c Compatible 16-bit\n\nOn the PC, Call of Duty players receive the definitive experience, with assets, display resolutions, and textures that best the 1080p experiences. PC players benefit from higher-quality, high-precision and settings like HBAO, Ambient Occlusion, SMAA anti-aliasing, and super sampling.\n\nSo for our reference baseline results we test with our image quality settings maxed out aside from what we'll mention, overall a nice quality setting for PC gamers alright."
