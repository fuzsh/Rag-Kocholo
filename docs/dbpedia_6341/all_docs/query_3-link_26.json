        "text": "As we’re now two months into 2024, more information about the upcoming Call of Duty release is coming to light. Set to be developed by Treyarch, Call of Duty 2024 is reportedly taking people back to the Gulf War. Here’s everything we know about the upcoming release.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War\n\nIt’s been known for a while now that the 2024 Call of Duty release will likely be titled, Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War. This game has been in development since Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and therefore will have the longest development cycle of any Call of Duty ever with a four-year development timeline. Reportedly, Black Ops Gulf War will take players back in time to one of the most historic conflicts in history. The game will lean into a more traditional combat style and will focus on some more nuanced moments of the Gulf War that people may not know.\n\nBlack Ops Gulf War is also rumored to bring returning maps from the Black Ops franchise, and the return of a round-based Zombies mode. Round-based Zombies is something that the community has been asking to return for a while now and may bring back a large number of players.\n\nWe can also expect Activision Blizzard to double down on their pre-order bonuses. Recently, we have seen players given access to the Campaign up to a week early by pre-ordering the game. In 2024, we could see players given access to the full game early by pre-ordering, and the campaign access could be up to weeks ahead of the release.\n\nOpen World Campaign\n\nInsider Gaming recently reported that Black Ops Gulf War is set to have an open world style campaign. Players have experienced some open-world elements in the Modern Warfare 3 campaign, however, this story has been built from the ground up. The Campaign will be developed by Raven Software and will see players use vehicles and fast travel to get around the map, however, there will still be some linear elements to missions.\n\nGiven that many fans were critical of Modern Warfare 3’s Campaign, an immersive, open-world experience could be enough to bring some fans back to the story element of Call of Duty.\n\nPotential Game Pass Release\n\nWith Microsoft recently acquiring Activision Blizzard, we could see the 2024 Call of Duty release launch on day one with Xbox Game Pass. While this is yet to be confirmed, we do know that there are plans to bring future and past Call of Duty titles to Game Pass, and Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War could be the first.\n\nWe can also expect the usual release day of October or November for Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War, with an announcement in May or June."
