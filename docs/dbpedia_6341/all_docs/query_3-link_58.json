        "text": "Activision is calling Treyarch out from the ball pen as the publisher announced yesterday evening during its investor call the developer is working on 2015’s Call of Duty game.\n\nIt’s been three years since Treyarch developed Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, making this the first Call of Duty title in the developer’s history to have a three-year development cycle. In fact, it’s only the second game in the series to receive that much development time, the first one being last year’s Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.\n\nInformation on Treyarch’s upcoming Call of Duty title is scarce at the moment, leaving us to completely guess as to where they’ll be taking us later this year. If I were a betting man, I’d assume a zombies mode will be making a comeback once again. I just hope they’re nazi zombies as those are the most terrifying zombies of ‘em all."
