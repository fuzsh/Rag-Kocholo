        "text": "üòÆ Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been revealed\n\nü§î The game is described as ‚Äúa dark new chapter‚Äù\n\nüëè It‚Äôs been playtested for over two years and has had the longest development cycle of any Call of Duty game to date\n\nüìÜ A full reveal will take place on June 9 after the Xbox Games Showcase\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been officially announced by Activision and Xbox, and according to a developer, it‚Äôs been playable for two years.\n\nThe next Call of Duty, which will undoubtedly get tills ringing and bring in a boatload of cash for Microsoft in the process, is being developed by Treyarch Studios and Raven Software. It returns to the globe-trotting Black Ops franchise, which saw its last entry in 202, and is being described as ‚Äúa dark new chapter‚Äù.\n\nThe game has reportedly enjoyed a lengthier development cycle than most entries in the series and has benefited from extensive play testing, according to Treyarch developer, Nicole Havin.\n\nHavin, who is a game designer on Call of Duty‚Äôs zombies mode, posted on X: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been playtesting this one for 2 years! y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt ready üòÅü§´ #BlackOps6‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs encouraging news considering many felt Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was rushed, particularly the campaign. The game ended up with a rather abysmal Metacritic score of 56 after 71 reviews, which is much lower than the series is used to.\n\nA full reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will take place on June 9, after Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox Games Showcase. The game‚Äôs multi-million dollar marketing campaign has already begun, with a full-page ad appearing in USA Today newspaper.\n\nA teaser trailer called ‚Äúwake up (rushmore) #thetruthlies‚Äù has also been released, showing a squad vandalizing the historic monument with blindfolds. The game will likely be set during the Gulf War.\n\nNo release date has been given, or which versions of the game will be available to purchase, but it could be the first Call of Duty to launch straight into Xbox Game Pass on day one. Microsoft has reportedly been mulling over the decision to put Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass, but it‚Äôs expected to arrive on the subscription service and could be part of a new, more expensive tier.\n\nWe‚Äôll let you know when Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 preorders go live, as it‚Äôs bound to be one of the biggest games of the year ‚Äì as usual."
