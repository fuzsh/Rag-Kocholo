        "text": "The Call of Duty franchise has always had new content ready across devices for fans to explore. There’s almost always a new addition to the franchise on the horizon—recently, it’s been Warzone Mobile that the community has been waiting for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe secret to its fast-paced launches might just have been discovered, though, and fans are not happy. With their perspective on the games completely changed, players are calling out Activision and demanding answers for its decisions.\n\nThe Newer Call of Duty Games Use the Same Old Engine\n\nA CoD fan on X recently shared a screenshot containing information about Modern Warfare 3, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile. All of these titles share the same engine—IW 9.0—which is a highly upgraded version of what supported the original Modern Warfare released in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother fan brought up how the IW engine was based on id Tech 3, whose last stable release was in 2005.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlayers have faced quite a bit of issues with the IW engine and were disappointed to hear that Warzone Mobile would be using it.\n\nEven though the engine has been updated over time, fans demand a change from Acitivision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout this discourse, Microsoft has surprisingly avoided shots from the community while Activision tanked them all.\n\nA History Lesson on the Call of Duty Engine\n\nAlmost all the Call of Duty entries run on different iterations of the IW engine, with exceptions for a few titles released in between. Let’s quickly dive into the evolution of the IW engine, a key player in delivering the immersive experiences we’ve come to love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe engine’s journey began in 2005 with CoD 2, operating under a proprietary license, and it wasn’t until E3 2009 that the engine got an official name – IW 4.0 – as it powered the much-anticipated CoD: MW2.\n\nBefore IW 4.0, we witnessed the prowess of IW 3.0 in CoD 4: MW. This iteration brought notable features like bullet penetration, enhanced AI, upgraded lighting engines, and more. Fast forward to IW 4.0, gracing MW2 and later CoD Online, introducing texture streaming for higher graphical details without compromising performance.\n\nMW3 embraced an upgraded IW 5.0, boasting improvements in streaming technology for rendering larger regions. Then came CoD: Ghosts with IW 6.0, making its mark by supporting eighth-gen consoles and introducing Pixar’s SubD for intricate details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTreyarch modified IW 3.0 for CoD: World at War, evolving into the Black Ops II engine with features like dynamic resolution scaling. Sledgehammer Games introduced a custom engine in CoD: Advanced Warfare, refined for subsequent titles. The baton passed to the revamped IW 8.0 in CoD: MW (2019), featuring ray tracing for PC.\n\nNow, we enter the era of IW 9.0. Featured in MWII and MWIII, it introduces a cutting-edge water simulation system and embraces Intel’s Xe Super Sampling for top-notch visuals.\n\nDo you think the IW engine is holding back the CoD franchise? Should Activision throw in the towel and shift engines? Share your thoughts in the comments below!"
