        "text": "Did cold war's final season not end with the death of Perseus and the group falling apart?\n\nNo we capture Stitch and it is revealed that Perseus died before that point but that he's a movement not a single person\n\nAs an Iraqi, can we fucking not? My country is still in shambles with no recovery in sight. Arabs and Muslims have been dehumanized enough. For fucks suck.\n\nWell being Black Ops and following closely after Cold War..\n\nRussians will probably be responsible for everything and the legit bad guys.\n\nWouldn't surprise me if the fall of the Soviet Union is heavily explored and directly interconnected\n\nWouldn't surprise me at all of Black Ops 2, including the Cold War events from that game, as well as Black Ops 3 & 4 get completely retconned. Black Ops 2's 2025 story is basically impossible to attach to the current Modern Warfare story.\n\nI have a feeling they are going to do a half-retcon.\n\nBasically anything that happened in the flashbacks of BO2, still happened, but anything in the \"present day\" didn't happen.\n\nConsidering they made a big deal about bringing back Makarov, there is no way they aren't going to bring back Menendez. Doubly so since the know he's a popular villain, hence why he headlined that the final Vanguard season which was meant to be a return of a bunch of villains across the games.\n\nWasn't John Major in charge during the Gulf War or am I misremembering my own childhood? Felt sure Thatcher had fucked off by then. Anyway good conflict to use for some non missions and a short campaign.\n\nWonder if they will have SAS Scud Hunting missions…\n\nAbsolute stone cold mystery and who is to say 8f there is a Bravo Two Zero escape or a Three Kings esque part. Just no way to know.\n\n\"round based zombie modes\" ugh no thanks. Outbreak and the DMZ Zombies is the most fun I've had with COD since Infinite Warfare.\n\nWould be nice to see a mix which they might still do.\n\nI didn't like Outbreak that much but I've been actually having a good time with DMZ Zombies just due to how easy it is to pick up and play and still have that difficulty once you get to Tier III. Also the community has been weirdly cool since it's PvE only. Been hoppin in and just joining random squads to run missions/contracts.\n\nI wonder if this'll be the first COD game on Switch.\n\nSwitch 2, obviously.\n\nOh I haven't played Vanguard, but is it connected as well?\n\nSpoilers if you care:\n\nAt the end of the Campaign, they are looking through a bunch of Nazi documents after killing a dude who was trying to revive the Reich after the war ended and find stuff talking about their work with Zombies and Nova 6.\n\nMicrosoft marketed the deal as \"bringing COD to 150 million more people\" when talking about Nvidia and Nintendo deals and I doubt Nvidia has even 2 million people. I guess it's likely it was all a bluff but I wouldn't be surprised to see it come to regular Switch as well.\n\nThe game is barely running on base PS4 and Xbox One as it is. Like, OG Xbox One can barely maintain even 40 FPS at this point. Sure, maybe if they do a Cloud version, but that is unlikely.\n\nThe game is barely running on base PS4 and Xbox One as it is. Like, OG Xbox One can barely maintain even 40 FPS at this point. Sure, maybe if they do a Cloud version, but that is unlikely.\n\nNot what they told the CMA which going back on would hurt their future acquisitions:\n\nIn a filing submitted to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (via The Verge), Microsoft revealed that it believes the free-to-play Warzone and Call of Duty's full premium releases can both have a home on Nintendo's hybrid console.\n\n\"The game engine that powers Warzone is mature and has been optimized to run on a wide range of hardware devices (ranging from the Xbox One console released in 2015 up to the Xbox Series X),\" part of the filing reads. \"Warzone supports PC hardware with GPU cards that were released as far back as 2015 (i.e., prior to the release of Nintendo Switch in 2017).\"\n\nIt seems Microsoft is ready for Activision Blizzard to pursue the downgraded port option as well when it comes to releasing Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms.\n\n\"The Activision development team have a long history of optimizing game performance for available hardware capabilities,\" the statement reads. \"The Parties are confident that in addition to Warzone, CoD buy-to-play titles (e.g., CoD: Modern Warfare 2) can be optimised to run on the Nintendo Switch in a timely manner using standard techniques which have been used to bring games such as Apex Legends, DOOM Eternal, Fortnite and Crysis 3 to the Switch.\"\n\nMicrosoft 'Confident' It Can Get Call of Duty Running on Nintendo Switch - IGN\n\nFollowing Microsoft and Nintendo's agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms for at least a decade, Microsoft has further detailed its plans for Call of Duty on Nintendo Switch.\n\nNot what they told the CMA which going back on would hurt their future acquisitions:\n\nMicrosoft 'Confident' It Can Get Call of Duty Running on Nintendo Switch - IGN\n\nFollowing Microsoft and Nintendo's agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms for at least a decade, Microsoft has further detailed its plans for Call of Duty on Nintendo Switch.\n\nI think they will just skirt that under the rug lol\n\nLike even if they could get it locked 30 FPS with even further paired back graphics, that puts you at a massive disadvantage in a game like CoD.\n\nAhh well, not that much then.\n\nI personally don't consider Zombies canon, so its fine lol\n\nWell, I mean, Zombies does explain why Weaver doesn't show up in any of the past stuff in BO2 and also explains why Lev Kravchenk was in Afghanistan during the BO2 flashback portions since his fuck up in the BOCW Zombies storyline got him shipped there.\n\nis Treyarch better at animations and sound design than SHG?\n\nprobably the heaviest downgrade in MW3 was animations and sounds of the new guns.\n\nIts wild how bad most MW3 weapons sound compared to MW19 and MW2.\n\nsame with animations.\n\nWe don't really know for sure. Treyarch has yet to work on the new engine. Cold War doesn't really count as most of that work was cobbled together off of what Sledgehammer was working on.\n\nI'd imagine with the amount of time and resources the game will be on par with MWII. At least I hope."
