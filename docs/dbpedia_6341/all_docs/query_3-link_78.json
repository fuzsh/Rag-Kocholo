Be sure to head over to CallOfDuty.com/blackops as more details begin to unfold!\"\n\nActivision has said previously that Treyarch would be providing a new title for the series this year while Infinity Ward works on Modern Warfare 3.\n\nSledgehammer Games, a studio formed last November by ex-Visceral studio head Glen Schofield and Dead Space executive producer Michael Condrey, is also working on the development of a Call of Duty game that Activision has said will \"extend the franchise into the action-adventure genre.\"\n\nUPDATE: In a short statement, Treyarch studio head Mark Lamia said the developer was eager for fans to play its new creation.\n\n\"We can't wait for our community to experience Call of Duty: Black Ops,\" said Lamia. \"We have focused our entire studio on this game, with dedicated multiplayer, single-player and co-op teams creating the most intense, gripping and riveting experience possible for our fans on all fronts.\""
