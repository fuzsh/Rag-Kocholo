        "text": "Expect a world-class Multiplayer experience celebrating the Modern Warfare series’ greatest legacies; all 16 launch maps from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) have been modernized with new modes and gameplay features and will be available at launch to get everyone started, while over 12 all-new core 6v6 maps will fuel post-launch live seasons.\n\nFor the first time, team up with other squads to survive and fight massive hordes of the undead in the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever. Modern Warfare Zombies (MWZ) tells a new Zombies story from developer Treyarch, with missions, core Zombies features, and a host of secrets to discover.\n\nCampaign: Adapt or Die in a Fight Against the Ultimate Threat\n\nIn the direct sequel to the record-breaking Modern Warfare II, Captain Price, and Task Force 141 face off against the ultimate threat. The ultranationalist Vladimir Makarov is extending his grasp across the world, causing Task Force 141 to fight like never before.\n\nCombat means making decisions; using different Loadouts and planning different paths through every operation across an involved and thrilling Campaign. In addition to the signature, cinematic Call of Duty missions, Modern Warfare III introduces Open Combat Missions, with even greater emphasis on player choice. Naturally, you’ll have the use of all the weapons, equipment, and tactics present in an action-packed Modern Warfare single-player experience, but for some of your engagements, it is completely up to you to decide on an appropriate course of action.\n\nOpen Combat Missions\n\nOpen Combat Missions (OCMs) are an exciting innovation to the Call of Duty Campaign. Not only do these complement the cinematic missions you’ve come to expect, but they also provide you with numerous additional choices regarding your methods of mission completion. For example, if you prefer to use stealth techniques, you may wish to undertake an OCM with a lights-out approach, using night-vision goggles and suppressed weapons and complete your objectives without your adversaries knowing you were even there. However, if loud explosions and reckless abandon are part of your repertoire, strap extra armor plates onto your torso and hit those targets head-on!\n\nFeel free to take advantage of any operable vehicles within your area of operations. You’re able to experiment with and leverage tactical and lethal equipment. You have the flexibility to maneuver across the sizable landscape of a mission’s AO and approach objectives from multiple angles. You can truly play how you want to play, and Open Combat Missions will support it.\n\nMultiplayer: It’s Time to Settle Old Scores and Start New Ones\n\nModern Warfare III celebrates the 20th anniversary of Call of Duty with one of the greatest collections of Modern Warfare Multiplayer maps ever assembled.\n\nLegendary Core Maps. Modern Gameplay.\n\nAfghan. Derail. Estate. Favela. Karachi. Highrise. Invasion. Quarry. Rundown. Rust. Scrapyard. Skidrow. Sub Base. Terminal. Underpass. Wasteland.\n\nAll 16 launch maps from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) have been modernized, both graphically and with meticulous attention given to the authenticity and aspects of the maps that made them so popular. Veteran players love these Core 6v6 maps, and there’s no better time to introduce a generation of new players to experience the community’s favorite Modern Warfare content.\n\nPrepare for seminal design to meet modern gameplay. This faithful modernization of the maps keeps their authenticity intact while infusing the latest tech, gameplay, modes, content, and more. Though you might have noticed elements of Terminal and Highrise during your time in Al Mazrah, the Modern Warfare III versions of these maps are built from scratch from the original 2009 designs.\n\nIn addition to brand-new modes like Cutthroat (a competitive 3v3v3 experience), a full range of fan-favorite and innovative gameplay features will be available at launch to get everyone started, like choosing to play Hardpoint and Kill Confirmed on Favela, modes that were never part of the original map offering, providing a refreshing multiplayer experience within these familiar environments.\n\nGoing Big with Brand-New Maps. Ground War and War Modes Return!\n\nThe 16 Core launch maps are further complemented with the addition of four huge environments ready at launch and containing a host of new play spaces. These are composed of three brand-new Battle Maps — large scale locations where Modern Warfare III’s Ground War and Invasion game modes will be fought — and a single, colossal War map, as Modern Warfare III marks the welcome return and evolution of the legendary War Mode that first debuted in 2017’s Call of Duty®: WWII.\n\nAll-New Core Map Content Comes to Live Season Content\n\nWith Day One Multiplayer content featuring faithful modernizations of Modern Warfare’s fan-favorite maps, over 12 all-new core 6v6 maps will fuel post-launch live seasons.\n\nMultiplayer Features: New Mechanics and Robust Customization\n\nExpect many customization advancements and new gameplay mechanics to further evolve the quintessential, fast-moving gameplay. Here are three innovations, with more to be revealed in the coming weeks:\n\nNew Gameplay Innovation: Tac-Stance\n\nBreach and clear with the new Tactical Stance feature, a perfect middle-ground between hip-fire and aiming down sights. When entering tight hallways and cramped rooms, toggle Tac-Stance on to improve weapon performance and win the fight. Here’s what to expect from Tac-Stance:\n\nThe operator unshoulders the weapon and holds it in a canted firing position.\n\nYou can toggle in and out of Tac-Stance dynamically while aiming down sights.\n\nTac-Stance trades precise accuracy for improved mobility and handling.\n\nSome spread to your firing will occur, best described as a middle ground between full ADS and hipfire.\n\nIt is designed to be used in aggressive, close-quarter combat situations.\n\nBy default, you fire in Tac-Stance while Sliding.\n\nNew Gameplay Innovation: Evolving Loadouts\n\nModern Warfare III brings new levels of customization to Create-a-Class. Get ready to build your Loadout based on cutting-edge military equipment, such as gloves, tactical vests, boots and more; allowing you to fine-tune more aspects of gameplay.\n\nNew Gameplay Innovation: After-Market Parts\n\nThe evolution of the Gunsmith continues with the addition of After-Market Parts. This is a special set of customization options allowing you to focus on your preferred and specific playstyle. After-Market Parts enable you to construct unique weapon configurations or types such as customizing a machine gun into a bullpup configuration (with the firing grip in front of the breech rather than behind it), thus increasing mobility and handling without compromising on damage output.\n\nAfter-Market Parts will also offer new progression paths, and challenges to unlock. We will be sharing more information on these innovations in the coming weeks.\n\nMultiplayer Features: Changes to Core Mechanics\n\nThe core mechanics of Modern Warfare III deliver a massive offering of classic features bringing exceptional freedom of choice, movement, and customization to gameplay.\n\nEnsure you stay one step ahead with all the latest official information about Modern Warfare III by checking the Call of Duty Blog in the coming days and weeks, whether you’re wanting intel on Open Combat Missions of the Campaign, even more details on the Multiplayer experience, or expanded and critical knowledge regarding the all-new open-world Zombies experience.\n\nPreorders are available now at participating retailers, in-game, via your platform Stores, or at CallofDuty.com. Get details on all the preorder rewards you can claim, including Campaign Early Access, Open Beta Access* and the Vault Edition, by reading the preorder blog (see “Related Articles” below).\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III is published by Activision. Development for the game is led by Sledgehammer Games, in partnership with Infinity Ward. Development for Modern Warfare Zombies is led by Treyarch, working closely with Sledgehammer Games. Additional development support provided (in alphabetical order) by Activision Central Design, Activision Central Technology, Activision QA, Activision Shanghai, Beenox, Demonware, High Moon Studios, Raven Software, and Toys for Bob.\n\nStay frosty."
