Sometimes features slip or drop off altogether, sometimes they get replaced with other, more awesome features as we hit into limitations of our original plans.\n\nThere is much more news to come including updates on Open Beta timing. In order to keep you informed, we’ll periodically publish developer blog posts to share our progress with our fans. Stay tuned to the Treyarch blog for more information.\n\nAnd yes, this is for real.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCesar Stastny\n\nDirector of Development"
