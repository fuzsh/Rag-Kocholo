This guide it just to show you how to add this client to your current install of Black Ops 3 w/out providing the game and it's dlc. Any links that provides the game & it's files are not associated with this github and we are not responsible if external links not provided on here act on malicious behavior!\n\nThe Boiii client was originally created by developer known as Maurice that alloweed users to play black ops 3 on dedicated servers instead of P2P connections and gives extra security by patching exploits that allows a hacker/cheater access to your pc and perform malicous acts against you. This mod is free and we are offering it in case the main source (https://reactiongaming.us/community/threads/how-to-play-black-ops-3-with-the-boiii-client.1971/) links no longer exists.\n\nYou will need a legit copy of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 (Steam), you can buy the game here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/311210/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III/\n\nPC/Laptop with an active internet connection\n\nZombies Chronicles DLC (Steam): https://store.steampowered.com/app/581450/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III__Zombies_Chronicles/\n\nBoiii Client Files: https://github.com/PS2ClassicsVault/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-3-BOiii-Client/releases\n\nDownload the boiii.exe and place it in your installed Black Ops 3 game folder. If you can't find where your exe is saved, check the downloads folder and right-click and copy and paste it into your installed black ops 3 game folder. If you get an operation failed or that a virus has been detected, try opening windows security Virus & Threat Protection\\Protection History and find the section labeled Threats blocked. Hit the down arrow and Actions button> Allow. You might have to redownload the file again.\n\nDownload the boiii.zip folder and extract it. When you extract, make sure you do not extract it into a secondary boiii folder. Put the folder named \"boiii\" in C:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Local. You can open it by hitting the Windows key+R and typing %localappdata% and pressing Enter.\n\nDownload the zip folder and extract it. When you extract, make sure you do not extract it into a secondary boiii folder. Put the folder named \"boiii\" in C:\\Users<username>\\AppData\\Local. You can open it by hitting the Windows key+R and typing %localappdata% and pressing Enter.\n\nNow drag and drop the boiii folder from the boiii.zip to your Local folder\n\nYour boiii folder should look like this in appdata\n\nDownload the Discord & Steam Bypass and run the .bat file from your downloads folder. This will automatically install the correct Steam and Discord files in the correct locations.\n\nNow you should be able to open boiii.exe. If you get an error message saying \"BOIII needs an active internet connection required on the first time you launch it\" then you failed at Step 3. Once in the game, you can change your name by opening the console with the ` button and typing\n\nname YourNameHere\n\nYou will have to reboot the game in order for the name change to take effect.\n\nIf you are looking for the unlockall command, it doesn't exist. HOWEVER, it does have something better. Go to the main menu of Black Ops 3. Go to Multiplayer>Play and the very bottom underneath the black market. Go to Stats. This stats menu will let you unlock whatever you want and change your Prestige and rank level to whatever you want.\n\nThis github contains semi-unmodified files shipped by the boiii developer. The only thing that changed is the master server list address. The Discord and Steam bypass bat file only creates empty files which is what the client looked for to determine if you were in the boiii testing Discord and owned the game on Steam. If you get boiii files from any other source, they may not include the RCE and other security fixes as they bypass ext.dill or other files/code, or they could contain malware. Please check this forum or our Discord. As of now, no future plans for updates are planned.\n\nReactionGaming/PS2 Classics Vault is not affiliated in any way with the boiii mod development. We are a non-profit community that loves to mod our video games for fun and research. The original developer has been ceased from future updates to this mod and we are proving these files without his permission (In fact, he asked us not to). What you see is what you get. Do not expect any further updates. We are not responsible for any future RCE/exploits to the game engine or the mod. We don't even host the master server.\n\nThe project was almost in trouble because you offered the actual game and it's dlcs and that is why activision was going on a DCMA takedown spree, If you would of just took down the game files and dlc files, you wouldn't have to even worry, that is why plutonium is still here! - Sorry, wish i could of told you in better circumstances!\n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ea45a595246d04c975da85787772cdaeb46b957b4bf138d52a876e1e6428dd87\n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9e442b0e55f32011a9a2ceca31260b18edde487f49c9fc569e1ee0c8d188cd33?nocache=1\n\nIf your anti-virus flagsd any files it is a false POSITIVE, allow it and your good to go!"
