        "text": "Activision finally lifted the lid on Black Ops 6 earlier today, revealing key art and the title for the game. It came following months of speculation about ‘Call of Duty 2024’, and while we don’t know much about the game, a few details have been made clear since the teaser snippets started dropping online.\n\nRecently, an employee at Treyarch revealed on social media claimed that they’ve been playtesting Black Ops 6 for two years, stressing that we’re ‘not ready’ for this game. While we knew that Black Ops 6 has benefitted from a lengthier development cycle than normal, knowing that it has been playable to some extent for two years really is something.\n\nA Long Time Coming\n\nOn Twitter, Treyarch’s Nicole Havin, who has been working in Game Designer roles at the firm since 2022, confirmed that she’s been testing Black Ops 6 for two years:\n\nOf course, per the typical development cycle of games, the build that Treyarch would have been ‘playtesting’ two years ago would likely have been a framework of a title that would be miles away from making it to the market. Regardless, it’s interesting to know that Black Ops 6 has been playable in at least some state for longer than it took to develop Modern Warfare 3 in its entirety.\n\nEarlier today, Activision revealed the art and title for this year’s Call of Duty, satiating the eagerness of fans worldwide and finally making it clear that this iteration is a follow-on of sorts from 2020’s Black Ops Cold War. We’re seeing references in the teasers pointing to the Gulf War, so the rumours and claims that the game will be set during the 1990 – 1991 conflict are well-founded."
