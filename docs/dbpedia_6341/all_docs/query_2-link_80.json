        "text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is the 12th installment in the popular first person shooter franchise. It includes a single player campaign set in 2065, as well as multiplayer and zombies modes. The multiplayer mode features a ranking system where players level up to unlock rewards. Black Ops 3 utilizes the IW game engine to power its graphics, which perform well on next generation consoles but show their limitations on older systems. The game follows conventions of the first person shooter genre while developing gameplay through the use of advanced technology like exo suits."
