        "text": "Call of Duty, electronic game that brought new advances to the first-person shooter genre, winning numerous game of the year awards in 2003 and 2004 following its 2003 debut. Designed by the American company Infinity Ward and produced by Activision, Call of Duty used World War II as a setting, allowing players to see the war through the eyes of American, Soviet, and British soldiers. Call of Duty combined challenging single-player missions with a multiplayer engine that breathed new life into a genre spawned by such gaming greats as Doom and Quake.\n\nCall of Duty allowed players to advance through World War II in a series of campaigns or to battle it out against human opponents in its multiplayer mode. Solo play featured a cast of computer-controlled allies to better simulate actual war, during which a soldier would have been part of a large group rather than always fighting alone. The ability to pull up and aim firearms, to relive the last few seconds of a fallen comradeâ€™s life, and to realistically be stunned by nearby explosions were notable features that helped distance the game from its competitors."
