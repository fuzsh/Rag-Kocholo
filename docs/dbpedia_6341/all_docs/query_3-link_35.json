        "text": "Call of Duty has recently faced a lot of criticism from fans for not paying attention to details in their games. But with the recent report, it is revealed that Treyarch has been developing the next Call of Duty game called Black Ops 6 for almost 4 years. This is the most time a Call of Duty title has spent in development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 only remained 16 months in the development cycle before the release. Modern Warfare 3 faced many criticisms but it was not for technical issues but for the developer’s lack of focus on the campaign. So with 4 years, Black Ops 6 has the potential to be the best Call of Duty ever.\n\nWhat we know so far about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6\n\nReportedly, the development of Black Ops 6 started 4 years ago and is going to be the most ambitious title in the Call of Duty franchise. Now that Microsoft holds the reigns of Activision, the development must have seen a bigger boost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft’s resources and Treyarch’s development, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 can have cutting-edge graphics, intricate storytelling and a multiplayer experience that can make it the best game in the Franchise. Not many details about the content of Black Ops 6 are known but Activision is holding an announcement on June 9th to reveal more details.\n\nReportedly, Treyarch has already completed most of the development work and has been testing the game for around 2 years now. If the reports are correct, this is the longest testing done for any Call of Duty title ever as most titles in the series usually take 2 years total from development to release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans have been very happy to hear the news about the development cycle for 2 reasons. Firstly, the Black Ops series is back and secondly, after the controversially short campaign of Modern Warfare 3, players are hopeful for a longer and more exciting campaign story to enjoy.\n\nA New Dawn for the Call of Duty Franchise\n\nThe whole gaming community is holding high expectations for June 9th when they finally get the official announcement for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This might be the chance for Call of Duty to make a comeback after the debacle which was Modern Warfare 3.\n\nAll of the Call of Duty: Black Ops series games have delivered well for players as well as the developers. However, with the past few titles of Call of Duty not meeting the player’s expectations, Black Ops 6 can be the last chance for the franchise to retain its fanbase.\n\nAdvertisement"
