        "text": "Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 lag can be a pain, but it can easily be remedied most of the time by looking at your hardware, or simply upgrading your drivers.\n\nModern Warfare 3 is known for its high demand for graphics, causing players with less powerful hardware to encounter the well-known lag problem, as per One Esports.\n\nThe Modern Warfare 3 lag problem may stem from various factors, with the most common being low-quality hardware, outdated graphics drivers, improper graphics settings, and unnecessary background applications. If you have an old PC from ten years ago, there is no solution to fix the issue other than upgrading to a new PC or laptop.\n\nIf you have a powerful PC with at least an RTX graphics card, we have some simple solutions for you.As previously stated, an old version of the graphics driver is a key factor in causing video game lag. Always ensure your system has the most up-to-date GPU driver, regardless if you have an AMD or Nvidia card.\n\nRead Also: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta is Coming This August-What to Expect?\n\nLessen MW3's Visual Quality\n\nIf the previous technique fails, try adjusting the video settings of Modern Warfare 3 to lessen the visual quality. Playing Modern Warfare 3 at the highest settings delivers the optimal experience, however, if you encounter frame rate issues, we suggest switching to the Low/Medium quality preset in the game settings.\n\nUnnecessary background applications consume vital resources like CPU and GPU usage. Hence, it is advisable to shut them down, particularly during sessions of graphic-heavy games such as Modern Warfare 3.\n\nFor example, if Chrome is open in the background, it uses up memory which can affect how well the game runs. Simultaneously, the Wallpaper Engine utilizes a significant amount of the GPU's power (around 30-40%).Therefore, it is advisable to close those applications to possibly resolve the lag problem.\n\nMW3 on Game Pass\n\nThe newest first-person shooter game from Activision Blizzard, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, can now be accessed on Xbox Game Pass, an online subscription service. The complete game is accessible through the Game Pass for eligible members.\n\nThis is a major step from Microsoft, the owner of Xbox and Activision Blizzard, as they expand their popular game streaming service with the latest generation of games.\n\nThe well-liked Zombies mode, single-player, and multiplayer campaigns of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III are now available to play on Game Pass.Furthermore, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can continue their progression and keep their weapons from Modern Warfare II through Carry Forward.\n\nIt was also announced that specific Xbox Game Pass tiers would be needed to access Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. Microsoft is allowing only Xbox Game Pass Console, PC, and Ultimate members to play the game as a benefit of their subscription, excluding Core members from this opportunity.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III is the initial game in the series to be offered on the Game Pass before the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will also be accessible on Day 1.\n\nRelated Article: Activision's Deadpool Game From 2013 Are Now Expensive Due to Deadpool & Wolverine's Box Office Success\n\nâ“’ 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
