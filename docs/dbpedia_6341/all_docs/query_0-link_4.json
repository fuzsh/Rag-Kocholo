        "text": "The Game Engine is what controls many aspects of the game such as physics and graphics.\n\nid Tech 3 Engine[]\n\nThe id Tech 3 Engine by Id Software is the first engine used by the series. Both the IW Engine and Treyarch NGL are based on it.\n\nCall of Duty (2003)\n\nCall of Duty: United Offensive (2004)\n\nCall of Duty: Classic (2009)\n\nIW Engine[]\n\nOriginal[]\n\nThe IW Engine was developed by Infinity Ward for Call of Duty 2 and was based on Id Tech 3. It's the game engine powering most of the Call of Duty series.\n\nIt is used by many games, including:\n\nCall of Duty 2 (2005) - IW 2.0\n\nCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) IW 3.0\n\nCall of Duty: World at War (2008) - IW 3.0 (Modified)\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) - IW 4.0\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops (2010) - IW 3.0 (Heavily Modified)\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011) - MW3 engine (Modified IW 4.0, unofficially IW 5.0)\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops II (2012) - Black Ops II engine (Heavily Modified IW 3.0)\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts (2013) - IW 6.0 (Updated MW3 engine)\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III (2015) - Black Ops III engine (heavily modified Black Ops II engine)\n\nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare (2016) - IW 7.0 (Modified IW 6.0 engine)\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018) - Black Ops 4 engine (heavily modified Black Ops III engine)\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (2020) - Black Ops Cold War engine (heavily modified Black Ops 4 engine) with tools from IW 8.0\n\nRevamped[]\n\nA revamped version of the engine, named IW 8.0, was developed by Infinity Ward Poland and Infinity Ward LA with assistance from NVIDIA. Its development started five years before the release of Modern Warfare in 2019. In 2022, Infinity Ward released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II with the updated engine IW 9.0.[1]\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) - IW 8.0\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone (2020) - IW 8.0\n\nCall of Duty: Vanguard (2021) - IW 8.0\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) - IW 9.0\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone 2.0 (2022) - IW 9.0\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023) - IW 9.0\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone Mobile (2024) - IW 9.0\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 (2024) - IW 9.0\n\nSledgehammer Games Engine[]\n\nSledgehammer Games built a custom in house-engine for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare[2] with little code from the MW3 Engine. An upgraded version was developed for Call of Duty: WWII. It is also used by Raven Software and Beenox for the two remasters of the Modern Warfare series.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014) - Version 1\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered (2016) - Version 1\n\nCall of Duty: WWII (2017) - Version 2\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered (2020) - Version 1\n\nTreyarch NGL[]\n\nTreyarch developed an in-house engine named Treyarch NGL based on the Call of Duty: United Offensive version[3] of the Id Tech 3 engine. It was only used in two games before it was replaced by IW 3.0 for Call of Duty: World at War.\n\nCall of Duty 2: Big Red One (2005)\n\nCall of Duty 3 (2006)\n\nAsura Engine[]\n\nThe Asura Engine is the engine used by Rebellion Developments for their version of Call of Duty: World at War.\n\nCall of Duty: World at War: Final Fronts (2008)\n\nRenderWare[]\n\nThe RenderWare is a game engine developed by Criterion Games. It was chosen by Spark Unlimited for one Call of Duty game.\n\nCall of Duty: Finest Hour (2004)\n\nUnity Engine[]\n\nUnity is a generic cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. So far it's only used for mobile Call of Duty games.\n\nCall of Duty: Heroes (2014)\n\nCall of Duty: Strike Team (2013)\n\nCall of Duty: Mobile (2019)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe choice of RenderWare by Spark Unlimited made the development of Call of Duty: Finest Hour extremely difficult and caused the massive delay of the release date.[4]\n\nDuring the development of the game, Criterion Games, the developer of the RenderWare engine, was acquired by Electronic Arts, one of the rivals of Call of Duty's publisher, Activision."
