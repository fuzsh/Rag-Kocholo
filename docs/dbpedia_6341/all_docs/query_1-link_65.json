        "text": "Since being officially revealed at Call of Duty®: Next in September and hot on the heels of the Call of Duty®: Warzone™ Mobile Global Summit in London, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile is now available in Limited Release.\n\nDuring Limited Release, all of the key features coming to Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile - Battle Royale, shared progression, social connectivity, Multiplayer, in-game events, and more all on Verdansk - will be there. However, many pieces of content, features, modes, and more will be partially completed and continually updated as we continue development in the lead up to worldwide launch.\n\nRead on for more details about Limited Release.\n\nWhat is Limited Release?\n\nLimited Release is a work-in-progress version that allows us to open the game to a much larger audience than our original Closed Alpha and in a real-world environment while still keeping it small enough to easily stress test matches and progression, find and fix bugs, as well as collect feedback and insights on all aspects of the game.\n\nWhen will the Limited Release of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile become available in my region/country?\n\nLimited Release began in Australia on November 30, 2022 at 3PM AEDT. As we continue with development and testing on the road to worldwide launch in 2023, we’ll add regional availability and announce the specifics through Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile social channels or the Call of Duty blog.\n\nHow do I access the Limited Release of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile?\n\nSign up for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile through the App Store on iOS, the Google Play Store on Android, or via theCall of Duty: Warzone Mobile webpage. When the Limited Release is available in your region, that will be where you can download it.\n\nWhat are the minimum specs for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile during Limited Release?\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone Mobile is currently still in development and being optimized to run on a variety of devices. To be able to play during Limited Release, your Android or iOS mobile device will need to meet the following requirements:\n\nApple: iPhone 8+ or better\n\nAndroid: Adreno 618 or better\n\nApple Memory: 4GB RAM or better\n\nAndroid Memory: 6GB RAM or better\n\nWhat content will be included during Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile’s Limited Release?\n\nAll of the key features coming to Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile - Battle Royale, shared progression, social connectivity, Multiplayer, in-game events, and more all on Verdansk - will be there during Limited Release. However, many pieces of content, features, modes, and more will be partially completed and continually updated as we continue development in the lead up to worldwide launch.\n\n· Two Battle Royale modes\n\no 20-minute matches - quads grouping.\n\no 10-minute matches - duos grouping.\n\n· Two Multiplayer playlists on two maps\n\no Team Deathmatch (6v6)\n\no Domination (6v6)\n\no Scrapyard and Superstore maps.\n\n· Social Features\n\no Friend List – Shared across Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare® II.\n\no Party – Maximum size six in a match.\n\no Channels – Up to five, for chat across Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II.\n\no Voice Chat – In and out of game across Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II.\n\n· Missions\n\no A unique way to acquire new items while pushing through milestones and earning points that can be redeemed for rewards.\n\n· Challenges\n\no Similar to other Call of Duty titles, these challenges will task players with completing sets of weapon, skill, or equipment-based tasks. These challenges offer a variety of rewards and a great way to get players to try out different play styles or tactics.\n\no Note, some Challenges will not be available at the start of Limited Release but will come online over time.\n\n· Shared Progression features across Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II.\n\no Player level\n\no Battle Pass\n\no Weapon Progress\n\n· A host of additional content, including Gunsmith, will be added throughout the Limited Release.\n\nIs playing Multiplayer required to progress in the game?\n\nNo. While Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile will have a Multiplayer mode, it will be an independent mode and a far more focused experience than anything players can experience in Call of Duty: Mobile or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Battle Royale is still the star mode of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile and will receive the most updates, changes, and overall support. Multiplayer is intended to provide a bit of variety and ways to jump into quick matches, test weapons or loadouts, and push through progression.\n\nHow will item availability and cross-progression with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 work during the limited release of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile?\n\nItems temporarily unavailable for use in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile during Limited Release are labeled as coming soon. These items will be obtainable and available for use in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 when available but cannot be equipped in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile until a future game update. Items available only in Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II are marked with the [WZ2.0 LIMITED] and/or [MWII LIMITED] tags.\n\nThis means players can obtain these items in the Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile store, but they will only be available for use in Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Players will get to keep all their progression made during the Limited Release of Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile.\n\nWill Limited Release content always be the same until global launch in 2023?\n\nThroughout the Limited Release phase, content will continue to evolve and expand as development continues with a wide array of refinements, updates, changes, and additions implemented between now and when everyone around the world will be able to get their hands on Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile in 2023.\n\nHow will I know if Limited Release is available where I live?\n\nKeep an eye on @warzonemobile on Twitter, @codwarzonemobile on Instagram, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile on Facebook, or the Call of Duty Blog for further updates.\n\nStay frosty."
