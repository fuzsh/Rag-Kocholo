        "text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the next installment in the yearly franchise. This time around, both Treyarch Studios and Raven Software are behind the new game, with the latter taking over the campaign duties.\n\nThe game will also feature the usual multiplayer, with a beta taking place before release, and zombies mode. We have gathered all the important details revealed or leaked about the new game as we wait for more news.\n\nBlack Ops 6 release date\n\nTreyarch has confirmed Black Ops 6 will launch on October 25th, 2024. This is slightly earlier than previous years but continues the trend of Black Ops games launching earlier than their Modern Warfare counterparts.\n\nAn early access period was rumored since before the game's reveal but Activision hasn't announced anything related to it.\n\nBlack Ops 6 is set to come out for current generation consoles (PS5 and Xbox Series X|S), previous generation consoles (PS4 and Xbox One), and PC through Steam, Xbox App, and Battle.net.\n\nBlack Ops 6 pre-orders\n\nPre-orders for Black Ops 6 are live, giving players plenty of time to purchase the game ahead of launch. Pre-ordering offers a range of benefits including access to challenges that unlock the Woods Operator and access to the beta.\n\nBlack Ops 6 trailer\n\nThe Black Ops 6 reveal trailer went live during the Xbox Showcase and has since become the most-watched Call of Duty trailer in the history of the franchise. Check it out below.\n\nBlack Ops 6 storyline\n\nSet in the early 1990s, the Black Ops 6 storyline focuses on Black Ops icons going rogue due to the actions of the US government following the fall of the Berlin Wall. In classic Black Ops fashion, expect plenty of mind-bending twists and turns and players attempt to figure out who's telling the truth.\n\nFrank Woods features once again and is bound to play an integral role in the story alongside a returning Russell Adler who is wanted by the CIA.\n\nBlack Ops 6 multiplayer\n\nEven though the multiplayer will be officially revealed on August 28 during the COD Next event, some users were able to access a version of the game through the PlayStation Store database and a bunch of information has leaked ever since.\n\nOne of the first things discovered in this build is that the game files has at least 20 maps, but it is unclear if all of them will be available at launch.\n\nThe game files have codenames for each map and not all are accessible through the leaked build. However, these codenames indicate that both Firing Range from Black Ops and Hacienda from Black Ops 4 will receive remastered versions.\n\nAlthough gameplays are everyone on social media, Activision is actively taking them down. That is why we won't be posting any videos here but you can find them with a quick search.\n\nYou can check out our other articles where we will list the different perks, equipment, weapons, and more elements from the multiplayer once they have been revealed.\n\nBlack Ops 6 beta\n\nAhead of the release, players can load into a small slice of multiplayer during the beta. The beta acts as the perfect chance for players to test the new movement system, how the maps flow, and stress test the servers before they're switched on in October."
