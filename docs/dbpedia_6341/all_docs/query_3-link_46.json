        "text": "Modern Warfare Zombies developer Treyarch has confirmed it has moved on from development for the mode, leaving Sledgehammer Games to wrap up the remaining story.\n\nTreyarch told CharlieIntel its team has shifted \"focus to something exciting on the horizon\", which is perhaps a nod to this year’s as-yet unannounced Call of Duty game, Black Ops Gulf War.\n\nThe confirmation is perhaps unsurprising given the lack of content Modern Warfare Zombies has received in recent months. Indeed today’s Season 3 update contains little for Zombies fans to get excited about, whereas Multiplayer and battle royale Warzone are in-line for a content-filled season.\n\nIn February, Zombies fans declared the mode “dead” just three months after Modern Warfare 3 came out after Treyarch indicated no new perks or enemy types were planned. The situation with Modern Warfare Zombies echoes that of DMZ, an extraction mode Activision moved on from after it launched with 2022’s Warzone 2.0.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe relentless pace of Call of Duty development and its annual release schedule mean there’s an army of Activision developers working on the first-person shooter franchise at all times, with each new mainline entry supposedly led by a different team each year. But last year’s Modern Warfare 3 marked a change in strategy, following directly on from Modern Warfare 2 just a year later.\n\nTreyarch, best known for the Black Ops series and the creation of the Zombies mode, was drafted in to make Modern Warfare Zombies for Modern Warfare 3. This year’s Call of Duty Black Ops Gulf War is expected to launch with a Zombies mode of its own. Fans will hope Activision supports it for longer than Modern Warfare Zombies.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
