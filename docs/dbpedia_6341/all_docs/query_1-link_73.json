        "text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 has been revealed to the world with an exciting new trailer. While The Rolling Stones' 1966 hit Paint it Black accompanied the run 'n' gun action, Treyarch’s turn at the CoD juggernaut takes us forward to the year 2035, a decade after the events of Black Ops 2. However, if the Black Ops series stays true to its roots, we fully expect flashback missions set in the Cold War era to flesh out the plot when the game lands on 6 November.\n\nTreyarch’s studio director, David Vonderhaar tweeted that Black Ops 3 is \"a best of game. Ten years in the making\". The team is clearly proud of what they’ve achieved in this time, and so they should be. This is the first Call of Duty to launch on PS4 and Xbox One with a brand new engine, and players can expect whole host of new features, including a four-player co-op campaign, plus a pseudo-open world.\n\nThe Black Ops 3 reveal trailer may only be a little over two minutes long, but we’ve seen enough to suggest it could be the biggest and best Call of Duty yet. Here’s why…\n\nNew engine = more variety\n\nTreyarch is going all out with their new game engine. Not only does it make Black Ops 3 look excellent, it also helps them step away from the corridor-shooter stylings of pretty much every other Call of Duty game. So there’s more scope for exploration and more ways to get the jump on the enemy.\n\nTake the underwater action, for example. CoD usually forces you into a swimming section - usually following the flippers of a squad mate - but here you can leap in, take out a few dudes and jump out to splat some more enemies. This varied approach will be welcome to the campaign stalwarts that have grown weary of the overuse of choke-points of late.\n\nThere’s also a bit right at the end where the main character punches and then elbows two foes in quick succession. The ability to string together melee whoopings is very much on the agenda for Black Ops 3, a first for the CoD series.\n\nAugmentations change the playing field\n\nThe crux of Black Ops 3’s story focuses on the bionic abilities of people who have been fitted with cybernetics that make them super-human. Yes, it’s unashamedly ripped from the Deus Ex handbook, but it does look to have changed the way we play Call of Duty for the better.\n\nNot only can you see an arm turn into a machine gun, but there are wall runs, boost-jumps, powerslides and the ability to control passing drones. There also appears to be a nod to Bioshock in here too, where a swarm of angry, futuristic bees are fired from a hand and onto some unsuspecting foes.\n\nA character crumples to their knees, the voiceover says: \"How far can you push technology, before it starts pushing back?\" This hints that either augmentations are still volatile and could kill their host or they can be hacked by the enemy. The latter will surely feature at some stage and you’ll no doubt have to fight on without them.\n\nRobo-baddies mean more boss fight possibilities\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that there’s a bloody load of robots to take down in Black Ops 3. It makes a change from the Nazis, Russians and the like. Allow us to take a leap of fantasy for a second, but with four-player co-op through the campaign and these massive machines crunching through the battlefields, wouldn’t this be the perfect set up for some epic boss fights? The answer is yes!\n\nThere’s not much Call of Duty could have previously done with boss battles as each one has been a human. Four players holding down a bad person and giving him a wedgie would be a laugh, but giant robot takedowns are way more fun. Yup, we expect traditional shoot-the-glowing-vulnerable-area boss rumbles in Black Ops 3.\n\nFuturistic gadgets and weapons mix things up\n\nThere’s a reason why Call of Duty keeps looking to the future recently - high-tech weaponry is far more fun than, say, a single-shot rifle. It allows the developer to get really creative and it seems Treyarch are having fun with it here.\n\nThe giant homing bowling ball of death looks ominous as it crushes a man. There appears to be a ground pound move where two spikes are jabbed into the floor as you land, which no doubt sends enemies flying. And this is all before we even talk about the slick pistols, rifles, machine guns and crossbows we also see. Couple these with the more open areas to fight around, and Black Ops 3 really looks to be shaping up into something special.\n\nDid you spot anything exciting in the Black Ops 3 trailer? Tell\n\n."
