Call of Duty: Black Ops III

2015's annual dose of Call of Duty action, Black Ops III, resumes the "future warfare" theme that has been running through the Call of Duty universe over the past three years. With each year, this franchise's production design and visual effects get better, and Black Ops III is no exception.

The game uses a heavily modified version of the IW engine which was previously used in Black Ops II. It makes use of DirectX 11 with high-res textures.
