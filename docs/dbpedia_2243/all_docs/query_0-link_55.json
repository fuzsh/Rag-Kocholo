        "text": "The South Caspian Basin is among the oldest oil and gas bearing prov inces in the world, which in as far back as early 20 th century was the worldwide lead in petroleum industry. In the last years interest in this region was rekindled in connection with the discovery of large offshore oil and gas fields and attraction of foreign investments in their development. Considering this, in the paper different aspects of petroleum geology of the South Caspian - Kura Basin, tectonic structure, stratigraphy, reservoir quality, s ource rock s, oil and gas geochemistry, mud volcanism are dealt with on the basis of a great body of factual material. Specific features of this oil and gas province are shown to be high sedimentation rates of the young Pliocene-Quaternary deposits, low thermal regime, overpressuring, mud volcanism etc.\n\nSW Iran and the adjacent offshore are prolific petroleum-producing areas with very large proven oil and gas reserves and the potential for significant new discoveries. Most of the oil and gas so far discovered is present in carbonate reservoir rocks in the Dehram, Khami and Bangestan Groups and the Asmari Formation, with smaller volumes in the Dashtak, Neyriz, Najmeh, Gurpi, Pabdeh, Jahrum, Shahbazan, Razak and Mishan (Guri Member) Formations. The Permo-Triassic Dehram Group carbonates produce non-associated gas and condensate in Fars Province and the nearby offshore. The Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Khami Group carbonates are an important producing reservoir at a number of offshore fields and in the southern Dezful Embayment, and are prospective for future exploration. Much of Iran's crude oil is produced from the Oligo-Miocene Asmari Formation and the mid-Cretaceous Sarvak Formation of the Bangestan Group in the Dezful Embayment. This review paper is based on data from 115 reservoir units at 60 oil-and gasfields in SW Iran and the adjacent offshore. It demonstrates that the main carbonate reservoir units vary from one-another significantly, depending on the particular sedimentary and diagenetic history. Ooidal-grainstones and rudist-and Lithocodium-bearing carbonate facies form the most important reservoir facies, and producing units are commonly dolomitised, karstified and fractured. In general, reservoir rocks in the study area can be classified into six major types: grainstones; reefal carbonates; karstified, dolomitised and fractured carbonates; and sandstones. The stratigraphic distribution of these reservoir rocks was principally controlled by the palaeoclimatic conditions existing at the time of deposition. A comparative reservoir analysis based on core data shows that dolomitised and/or fractured, grain-dominated carbonates in the Dehram Group, Lower Khami Group and Asmari Formation typically have better reservoir qualities than the Cretaceous limestones in the Upper\n\nThe Kangan Formation (Early Triassic) is one of the most important gas reservoirs in the Zagros fold-thrust belt. The study area is located in the west of Hormozgan Province and on the Gavbandi highland. This field is one of the important gas production anticlines in the SW Iran. To investigate the reservoir quality of the Kangan Formation in these wells, 163 microscopic thin sections were prepared from 97.68 m core for petrographic investigations. Then, petrophysical study was out carried using wireline wel l logs such as spectral gamma ray (SGR), sonic (DT), density (RHOB), and effective porosity (PHIE). The petrographic studies led to the identification of facies features and diagenetic processes affecting the quality of reservoir in the studied wells. These dia genetic processes include chemical and physical compaction, various cementation (especially anhydrite cement), fracturing, dissolution as well as different types of porosity resulting from these processes. Also, for the p...\n\nIn this paper boundary of Dashtak Formation (caprock) and Kangan Formation (reservoir rock) in South Pars and Kish gas fields was described by using well log data, geological information such as cuttings and thin sections, and mud logging data like master log. Trend of variation of this boundary is determined in wells A1 and B1 in Kish field and wells of phases 17 and 18 in south pars. It was concluded that lithology of member S2 in wells under study includes limestone, dolomite and anhydrite and no significant variation was observed except that its thickness increases from Kish field to South Pars field. S1 member (Aghar shale) in Kish gas field consists of gray claystones, light-dark gray shales, green-brown shales with pyrite but the lithology in South Pars becomes dark, gray-light gray, dark reddish brown claystones and also green-reddish brown shales with anhydrite and dolomitic interbeds. Thickness of S1 member increases from 9-11 m in Kish field to 24-27 m in South Pars field...\n\nA key element in the geological modeling of oil reservoirs is identifying and quantification of the reservoir rock types. Identifying reservoir rock types and their mineralogical composition is an important component of reservoir characterization process. Reservoir rocks description and establish the mineralogical composition were carried out on the Cretaceous reservoir rocks from an oil field belonging to Moesian Platform (Romania). In the paper we provide a detailed core description based on the macroscopic and microscopic petrographic investigations and qualitative and quantitative analysis by X-ray diffraction of several samples from Cretaceous carbonate reservoir rocks collected from different wells spudded on the structure. The petrographic study of the thin sections revealed the presence of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic rocks. We aimed to make a more detailed characterization of these rocks in terms of variety, composition and microstructures, such details as is known not being offered by geophysical investigations. The X-ray diffraction analyses revealed the presence in large quantity of the carbonate minerals, clay minerals and siliciclasts. The paper brings new information on the Cretaceous rocks increasing degree of knowledge of the reservoir rocks in the eastern part of Moesian Platform. Establishing global mineralogical composition, the rock type and textural characters have great importance because the Cretaceous deposits have proved an excellent quality as reservoir rocks.\n\nPetrophysical properties evaluation from well log analysis has always been crucial for the identification and assessment of hydrocarbon bearing zones. East Baghdad field is located 10 km east of Baghdad city, where the southern area includes the two southern portions of the field, Khasib formation is the main reservoir of East Baghdad oil field. In this paper, well log data of nine wells have been environmentally corrected, where the corrected data used to determine lithology, shale volume, porosity, and water saturation. Lithology identified by two methods; neutron-density and M-N matrix plots, while the shale volume estimated by single shale indicator and dual shale indicator, The porosity is calculated from the three common porosity logs; density log, neutron log, and sonic log, the water saturation is calculated by Indonesian model and Archie equation, and the results of the two methods were compared with the available core data to check the validity of the calculation.
