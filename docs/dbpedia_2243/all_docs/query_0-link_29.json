This achievement, a result of collaborative efforts between KazMunayGas, MOL Group and SINOPEC signifies a potent blend of international expertise and regional investment. With $534 million invested in the project to date, it not only propels Kazakhstan towards energy self-sufficiency but also contributes significantly to the national and local budgets. The project's socio-economic impact extends beyond revenue streams, with a commitment to allocate 1% of investments for local personnel training and over 3.1 billion tenge for regional development. This collaborative endeavor serves as a testament to Kazakhstan's proactive engagement in 12 promising geological survey projects alongside international partners. It reinforces the country's position as a key player in the global energy arena. Looking ahead, Kazakhstan envisions a dynamic landscape with multiple gas projects in the pipeline, including Urikhtau Centralnyi, Zapadnaya Prorva, and Kalamkas. Chairman of the Board of JSC NC KazMunayGas Magzum Mirzagaliyev, Vice President of MOL Group Zsombor Marton from Budapest and Chairman of Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration & Production Corporation Guo Yueliang from Beijing participated in the ceremony in a videoconference format."
