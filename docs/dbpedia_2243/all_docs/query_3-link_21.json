Jeffrey | June 12, 2019 | 2:25 PM EDT\n\n(CNSNews.com) – For the first time in the history of the United States, the federal government has spent more than $3 trillion in the first eight months of the fiscal year, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement released today.\n\nThe record $3,013,541,000,000 that the federal government spent in October through May of fiscal 2019 was $181,157,920,000 more than the previous record of $2,832,383,080,000 (in constant May 2019 dollars) that the federal government spent in October through May of fiscal 2009.\n\nTotal federal tax revenues in the first eight months of fiscal 2019 hit $2,274,902,000,000, which fell $5,612,990,000 short of the record $2,280,514,990,000 (in constant May 2019 dollars) that the Treasury collected in total tax revenues in the first eight months of fiscal 2016.\n\nEven with the second highest tax revenues ever collected in the first eight months of the fiscal year, the federal government still ran a deficit for those eight months of $738,639,000,000.\n\nTable 3 of the Monthly Treasury Statement, which summarizes federal receipts and outlays for the current fiscal year to date, indicated the Department of Health and Human Services cost the most money, accounting for $834,346,000,000 in federal spending in the first eight months of the fiscal year. The Social Security Administration cost the second most, accounting for $730,000,000,000 in federal spending during the period.\n\nThe Department of Defense was third, accounting for $439,289,000,000 in federal spending.\n\nThe combined $1,564,346,000,000 the federal government spent on HHS and the Social Security Administration during the first eight months of the fiscal year equaled 51.9 percent of the record total of $3,013,541,000,000 in federal spending during the period.\n\nThe combined $1,564,346,000,000 spent on HHS and Social Security was 3.56 times as much as the $439,289,000,000 spent on the Defense Department.\n\nStory 3: United States Government To Purchase 478 New Joint Strike Fighter F-35s Lightning II for the Air Force, Navy and Marines and Allied Militaries From and Lockheed Martin for About $34 Billion — Videos\n\nHere’s: What 310 Air Force Pilots Who Flew the F-35 Really Think\n\nWHAT ARE THE TOP 5 ISSUES OF F35 THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED?\n\n5 Most Powerful U.S Jet Fighter on the Planet\n\nF-35 Overview – The Good, The Bad, The Ugly\n\nDoD, Lockheed Martin reach tentative F-35 deal\n\nAir Force Pilots Explain Why Nothing Is Deadlier Than F-35 Stealth Fighter\n\nNext Purchase Of F35s Will Cost Pentagon Less\n\nPentagon Prepares To Purchase More F-35 Stealth Fighter Planes That Fail Tests\n\nF-22 Raptor Vs F-35 Lightning II\n\nWhy an F-22 Raptor Would Crush an F-35 in a ‘Dogfight’\n\nHere’s What the F-22 Raptor Will Do in a Combat with China\n\nF-22 RAPTOR VS F-35 LIGHTNING II – Which is better..?\n\n1 F 22 Vs 5 F 15s, Real Dogfight, Shocking Result\n\nF-35A Lightning II Demo 2019 Melbourne Air Show\n\nF-35 stealth fighter jets conducts flyover at White House | ABC News\n\nTrump Announces Japan’s Purchase of 105 New F-35 Stealth Fighter\n\nIncredible Video of F-35 Shows Its Insane Ability – Dropping Bom, Vertical Takeoff and Landing\n\nCan Russia and China Detect the F-35 Stealth Aircraft?\n\nStealth – How Does it Work?

I care about replacing post-Soviet gear in the Polish Air Force with the most modern one, Blaszczak said at a defense conference in Warsaw, as reported by local news site Defence24.pl. The ministry aims to replace the Air Force’s outdated Soviet-designed Sukhoi Su-22 and Mikoyan MiG-29 jets with fifth-generation fighters. The acquisition is to be carried out as part of Poland’s military modernization program under which Warsaw plans to spend some 185 billion zloty ($48 billion) on new weapons and equipment by 2026. Last April, Blaszczak said that the deal to purchase F-35s was not far away from being signed, as the Polish cabinet was holding the talks in parallel to its negotiations with Washington on the permanent deployment of U S troops to Poland. Warsaw has pitched for the United States to build a military base in the country, offering to allocate at least $2 billion toward the project, dubbed Fort Trump.\n\nF-35C First Integrated Carrier Ops Aboard USS Lincoln\n\nPentagon and Lockheed Martin Deliver 300th F-35 Aircraft\n\nThis jet fighter is a disaster, but Congress keeps buying it\n\nDefence analyst Pierre Sprey on the F-35 (2012) – the fifth estate\n\nOur 2012 interview with Pierre Sprey a defence analyst who spent 20 years working at the Pentagon and helped designed one of the most successful jetfighters ever, the A10 Warthog.

That’s the largest procurement in the Pentagon’s history.\n\nThe Defense Department and Lockheed Martin have reached a “handshake” agreement on a $34 billion contract to make hundreds of new F-35 fighter jets.\n\nAccording to a press release from Lockheed Martin, if the deal goes through, the company will produce a whopping 478 F-35s. That’s the largest procurement in the Pentagon’s history.\n\nAs a Pentagon spokesperson told The Washington Post, buying the jets in large quantities should allow the Defense Department to lower the average unit cost per plane significantly.\n\nThe F-35 program has been repeatedly criticized for its hefty price tag. After all, the estimated lifetime cost of the program is more than $1 trillion.\n\nhttps://www.newsy.com/stories/dod-lockheed-martin-reach-tentative-deal-for-f-35-jets/\n\nOne Pentagon official described it as the largest procurement in the history of the Defense Department.\n\nThe Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have reached a tentative agreement to procure 470 new F-35 fighter jets for the Air Force, Navy and Marines and allied militaries, the Defense Department announced Tuesday. A finalized contract award is expected in August, officials said.\n\nIf the massive order for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters is finalized, it will be the largest procurement in the history of the Defense Department. Its value is estimated at $34 billion.\n\nThe $34 billion agreement “marks the largest procurement in the history of the Department and provides a best value for our warfighter and taxpayer, incentivizes industry to continuously improve their performance and achieves the lowest F-35 unit prices per aircraft to date,” Vice Adm. Mathias Winter, F-35 program executive, said in an email to reporters.\n\nBuying the jets in bulk should allow the Pentagon to decrease the average unit cost of the plane by about 15 percent, a Pentagon spokeswoman said. And it should bring the cost of the most common F-35 variant below $80 million one year ahead of schedule.\n\nLockheed Martin program general manager Greg Ulmer touted the company’s cost savings in the most recent contract, which he chalked up to “smart acquisition strategies and a relentless focus on cost reduction.”\n\n“Beating our long-stated goal and delivering an F-35A below $80 million … is a testament to our joint government and industry team ― and we look forward to working with the Joint Program Office to finalize the agreement,” Ulmer wrote in an email.\n\nBoth Lockheed and the Defense Department are trying to address decades of criticism from congressional hawks and doves alike, who have characterized the F-35 program as too costly.\n\nAlmost since its inception, the F-35 has been a lighting rod for criticism around wasteful defense spending. And it has been a financial bedrock for Lockheed, propelling the Bethesda-based manufacturer to a dominant position atop the defense contracting hierarchy.\n\nProponents argue that the plane’s stealthiness, advanced sensors, targeting capabilities and extended flying range would make it an important asset in a war against a so-called “near-peer” competitor such as Russia or China.\n\nBut it is also the single most expensive military program in U.S. history by a wide margin, leading some to worry it will starve the Pentagon of resources it needs for other missions. The late senator John McCain called the F-35 a “poster child for acquisition malpractice” a “scandal” and a “tragedy” at different points during his tenure as Senate Armed Services Committee chairman.\n\nPresident Trump also took an interest in the plane early in his presidency when he criticized its “tremendous cost and cost overruns,” and asked the Pentagon to consider buying one of Boeing’s F-18 jets instead. In early 2017, the Pentagon awarded Lockheed a contract that shaved roughly $728 million in costs ― an amount roughly equivalent to cost reductions already in place during the Obama administration.\n\nEven Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who is the acting defense secretary, has criticized the plane.\n\n“The F-35, unequivocally, I can say, has a lot of opportunity for more performance,” Shanahan said in response to questions about whether he is biased toward his former employer.\n\nTeal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the contract announced Tuesday draws attention to the sheer size of the program. The agreement means Lockheed Martin will benefit from years of taxpayer-funded military contracts, and will be able to confidently plan for the future.\n\n“With contracts you recognize the sheer enormity of the [F-35] program,” Aboulafia said. “We could still see four or five more of these [multiyear production] contracts.”\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/11/pentagon-lockheed-martin-reach-tentative-billion-deal-hundreds-f-fighter-jets/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ae8a8f28df8e\n\nStory 4: What Will Cause The Next Recession In United States? — Videos\n\nTen Experts On When The Next Recession May Hit\n\nWhat Will Cause The Next Recession – Mark Zandi Says Corporate Debt\n\nWhat Will Cause The Next Recession – Robert Shiller On Human Behavior\n\nWhat Will Cause The Next Recession – Joseph Stiglitz On Trump’s Protectionism\n\nSteve Keen Says U.S. Heading for 2020 Recession\n\nUS China Trade War Explained -Who Needs Who?\n\nRead Full Post | Make a Comment ( None so far )\n\nThe Pronk Pops Show 688, May 27, 2016, Story 1: Remembering Americans Who Paid The Ultimate Sacrifice In Defense of Our Liberty and The Millions Saved By Truman’s Decision To Use Atomic Bomb To End World War II — Story 2: Trump’s Energy Independence and Dominance Plan — Videos\n\nPosted on May 27, 2016.

The White House said Obama will not apologize for dropping an atomic bomb on the city toward the end of World War II. The attack on August 6, 1945, caused massive and widespread destruction. Shock waves, radiation and heat rays took the lives of some 140,000 people. Three days later, the U.S. dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing another 74,000 people. President Obama is expected to tour the site of the world’s first nuclear attack with Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Obama’s communications adviser Ben Rhodes said that Obama’s time in Hiroshima will “reaffirm America’s longstanding commitment—and the president’s personal commitment—to pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.” Obama’s visit comes as a report by the Alliance for Nuclear Accountability has revealed the United States has been quietly upgrading its nuclear arsenal to create smaller, more precise nuclear bombs as part of a massive effort that will cost up to $1 trillion over three decades.

Commonly cited casualty figures provided by the Department of Defense are 4,435 killed and 6,188 wounded, although the original government report that generated these numbers warned that the totals were incomplete and far too low.[91] Nevertheless, the numbers are often repeated without this warning, such as on the United States Department of Veteran Affairs website.[92] In 1974, historian Howard Peckham and a team of researchers came up with a total of 6,824 killed in action and 8,445 wounded. Because of incomplete records, Peckham estimated that this new total number of killed in action was still about 1,000 too low.[93] Military historian John Shy subsequently estimated the total killed in action at 8,000, and argued that the number of wounded was probably far higher, about 25,000.[94] The “other” deaths are primarily from disease, including prisoners who died on British prison ships.\n\nb. ^ Other Actions Against Pirates: Includes actions fought in the West Indies, the Greek Isles, off of Louisiana, China and Vietnam. Other deaths resulted from disease and accidents.\n\nc. ^ Civil War: All Union casualty figures, and Confederate killed in action, from The Oxford Companion to American Military History except where noted (NPS figures).[21] estimate of total Confederate dead from James M. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom (Oxford University Press, 1988), 854. Newer estimates place the total death toll at 650,000 to 850,000.[27] 148 of the Union dead were U.S. Marines.[95]\n\nCA. ^ Civil War April 2, 2012 Doctor David Hacker after extensive research offered new casualty rates higher by 20%; his work has been accepted by the academic community and is represented here.\n\nd. ^ World War I figures include expeditions in North Russia and Siberia. See also World War I casualties\n\nda.^ World War II Note: as of March 31, 1946 there were an estimated 286,959 dead of whom 246,492 were identified; of 40,467 who were unidentified 18,641 were located {10,986 reposed in military cemeteries and 7,655 in isolated graves} and 21,826 were reported not located. As of April 6, 1946 there were 539 American Military Cemeteries which contained 241,500 dead.[96] Note the American Battle Monuments Commission database for the World War II reports that in 18 ABMC Cemeteries total of 93,238 buried and 78,979 missing and that “The World War II database on this web site contains the names of those buried at our cemeteries, or listed as Missing in Action, buried or lost at sea. It does not contain the names of the 233,174 Americans returned to the United States for burial…” Similarly, the ABMC Records do not cover inter-War deaths such as the Port Chicago disaster in which 320 died. As of November 2, 2011 Total of US World War II casualties {Military and Civilian} not recovered is 73,692; by February 15, 2014 the total of US World War II Casualties {Military and Civilian} not recovered is73,637; total of US World War II Casualties buried at sea are 6,061.\n\ne. ^ Korean War: Note:[21] gives Dead as 33,746 and Wounded as 103, 284 and MIA as 8,177. The POW/MIA gives the figures listed here: for example: The total “Battle Dead” of 33,686 is broken down into 23,637 KIA; 2,484 DOW: 4,759 MIA; 2,806 {POWS}. 2,830 are given as non-battle deaths; wounded 103,284 is given as the Number of incidences of wounded-including individual personnel wounded multiple times ;likewise 17,730 are listed separately as having died elsewhere Worldwide during Korean War. The American Battle Monuments Commission database for the Korean War reports that “The Department of Defense reports that 54,246 American service men and women lost their lives during the Korean War. This includes all losses worldwide. Since the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. honors all U.S. Military who lost their lives during the War, we have tried to obtain the names of those who died in other areas besides Korea during the period June 27, 1950 to July 27, 1954, one year after the Korean Armistice…”. {For a breakdown of Worldwide casualties of 54,246 see The Korean War educator at [97] gives figures as In-theatre/non theater} After their retreat in 1950, dead Marines and soldiers were buried at a temporary gravesite near Hungnam, North Korea. During “Operation Glory” which occurred from July to November 1954 the dead of each side were exchanged; remains of 4,167 US soldiers/Marines were exchanged for 13,528 North Korean/Chinese dead.[98] After “Operation Glory” 416 Korean War “unknowns” were buried in the Punchbowl Cemetery. According to a DPMO white paper [99] 1,394 names were also transmitted during “Operation Glory” from the Chinese and North Koreans {of whom 858 names proved to be correct}; of the 4,167 returned remains were found to be 4,219 individuals of whom 2,944 were found to be Americans of whom all but 416 were identified by name. Of 239 Korean War unaccounted for: 186 not associated with Punchbowl unknowns {176 were identified and of the remaining 10 cases 4 were non-Americans of Asiatic descent; one was British; 3 were identified and 2 cases unconfirmed}; Of 10 Korean War “Punchbowl Unknowns” 6 were identified.

Our oil imports have been cut in half.\n\nBut all this occurred in spite of massive new bureaucratic and political barriers.\n\nPresident Obama has done everything he can to get in the way of American energy. He’s made life much more difficult for North Dakota, as costly regulation makes it harder and harder to turn a profit.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton is in charge, things will get much worse. She will shut down energy production across this country.\n\nMillions of jobs, and trillions of dollars of wealth, will be destroyed as a result.\n\nThat is why our choice this November is so crucial.\n\nHere’s what it comes down to.\n\nWealth versus poverty.\n\nNorth Dakota shows how energy exploration creates shared prosperity. Better schools. More funding for infrastructure. Higher wages. Lower unemployment.\n\nThings we’ve been missing.\n\nIt’s a choice between sharing in this great energy wealth, or sharing in the poverty promised by Hillary Clinton.\n\nYou don’t have to take my word for it. Just listen to Hillary Clinton’s own words. She has declared war on the American worker.\n\nHere is what Hillary Clinton said earlier this year: “We are going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work.”\n\nShe wants to shut down the coal mines.\n\nAnd if Crooked Hillary can shut down the mines, she can shut down your business too.\n\nLet me tell you how President Obama Undermined Our Middle Class\n\nPresident Obama’s stated intent is to eliminate oil and natural gas production in America.\n\nHis policy is death by a thousand cuts through an onslaught of regulations.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency’s use of totalitarian tactics forces energy operators in North Dakota into paying unprecedented multi-billion dollar fines before a penalty is even confirmed.\n\nGovernment misconduct goes on and on:\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against seven North Dakota oil companies for the deaths of 28 birds while the Administration fast-tracked wind projects that kill more than 1 million birds a year.\n\nThe U.S Fish and Wildlife Service abuses the Endangered Species Act to restrict oil and gas exploration.\n\nAdding to the pain, President Obama now proposes a $10-per-barrel tax on American-produced oil in the middle of a downturn.At the same time President Obama lifts economic sanctions on Iran, he imposes economic sanctions on America. He has allowed this country to hit the lowest oil rig count since 1999, producing thousands of layoffs.\n\nAmerica’s incredible energy potential remains untapped. It is a totally self-inflicted wound.\n\nUnder my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence.\n\nImagine a world in which our foes, and the oil cartels, can no longer use energy as a weapon.\n\nBut President Obama has done everything he can to keep us dependent on others. Let me list some of the good energy projects he killed.\n\nHe rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline despite the fact that:\n\nIt would create and support more than 42,000 jobs.\n\nHis own State Department concluded that it would be the safest pipeline ever built in the United States.\n\nAnd it would have no significant impact on the environment.\n\nYet, even as he rejected this America-Canada pipeline, he made a deal that allowsIran to transport more oil through its pipeline that would have ever flowed through Keystone –with no environmental review.\n\nPresident Obama has done everything he can to kill the coal industry. Here are a few of President Obama’s decrees:\n\nRegulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and block the construction of new ones.\n\nA prohibition against coal production on federal land.\n\nDraconian climate rules that, unless stopped, would effectively bypass Congress to impose job-killing cap-and-trade.\n\nPresident Obama has aggressively blocked the production of oil & natural gas:\n\nHe’s taken a huge percentage of the Alaska National Petroleum Reserve off the table\n\nOil and natural gas production on federal lands is down 10%.\n\n87% of available land in the Outer Continental Shelf has been put off limits.\n\nAtlantic Lease sales were closed down too – despite the fact that they would create 280,000 jobs and $23.5 billion in economic activity.\n\nPresident Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords – unilaterally, and without the permission of Congress. This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.\n\nThese actions have denied millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet.\n\nThis is your treasure, and you – the American People – are entitled to share in the riches.\n\nPresident Obama’s anti-energy orders have also weakened our security, by keeping us reliant on foreign sources of energy.\n\nEvery dollar of energy we don’t explore here, is a dollar of energy that makes someone else rich over there.\n\nIf President Obama wanted to weaken America he couldn’t have done a better job.\n\nAs bad as President Obama is, Hillary Clinton will be worse.\n\nShe will escalate the war against American energy, and unleash the EPA to control every aspect of our lives.\n\nShe declared that “we’ve got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels,” locking away trillions in American wealth.\n\nIn March, Hillary Clinton said: “by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place.” Keep in mind, shale energy production could add 2 million jobs in 7 years.\n\nYet, while Hillary Clinton doesn’t want American energy, she is strongly in favor of foreign energy. Here is what she told China as Secretary of State:\n\n“American experts and Chinese experts will work to develop China’s natural gas resources. Imagine what it would mean for China if China unleashed its own natural gas resources so you are not dependent on foreign oil.”\n\nHillary Clinton has her priorities wrong. But we are going to turn all of that around.\n\nA Trump Administration will develop an America First energy plan. Here is how this plan will make America Wealthy Again:\n\nAmerican energy dominance will be declared a strategic economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.\n\nAmerica has 1.5 times as much oil as the combined proven resources of all OPEC countries; we have more Natural Gas than Russia, Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia Combined; we have three times more coal than Russia. Our total untapped oil and gas reserves on federal lands equal an estimated $50 trillion.\n\nWe will become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.\n\nAt the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.\n\nWe will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Cheaper energy will also boost American agriculture.\n\nWe will get the bureaucracy out of the way of innovation, so we can pursue all forms of energy. This includes renewable energies and the technologies of the future. It includes nuclear, wind and solar energy – but not to the exclusion of other energy. The government should not pick winners and losers. Instead, it should remove obstacles to exploration. Any market has ups and downs, but lifting these draconian barriers will ensure that we are no longer at the mercy of global markets.\n\nA Trump Administration will focus on real environmental challenges, not phony ones:\n\nWe will reject Hillary Clinton’s poverty-expansion agenda that enriches her friends and makes everyone else poor.\n\nWe’ll solve real environmental problems in our communities like the need for clean and safe drinking water. President Obama actually tried to cut the funding for our drinking water infrastructure – even as he pushed to increase funding for his EPA bureaucrats.\n\nAmerican workers will be the ones building this new infrastructure.\n\nHere is my 100-day action plan:\n\nWe’re going to rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule.\n\nWe’re going to save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton’s extremist agenda.\n\nI’m going to ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nWe’re going to lift moratoriums on energy production in federal areas\n\nWe’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies. These technologies create millions of jobs with a smaller footprint than ever before.\n\nWe’re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\n\nAny regulation that is outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers, or contrary to the national interest will be scrapped. We will also eliminate duplication, provide regulatory certainty, and trust local officials and local residents.\n\nAny future regulation will go through a simple test: is this regulation good for the American worker? If it doesn’t pass this test, the rule will not be approved.\n\nPolicy decisions will be public and transparent. They won’t be made on Hillary’s private email account.\n\nWe’re going to do all this while taking proper regard for rational environmental concerns. We are going to conserve our beautiful natural habitats, reserves and resources.\n\nIn a Trump Administration, political activists with extreme agendas will no longer write the rules. Instead, we will work with conservationists whose only agenda is protecting nature.\n\nFrom an environmental standpoint, my priorities are very simple: clean air and clean water.\n\nMy America First energy plan will do for the American People what Hillary Clinton will never do: create real jobs and real wage growth.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy will create a flood of new jobs:\n\nAlmost a $700 billion increase in annual economic output over the next 30 years.\n\nMore than a $30 billion increase in annual wages over the next 7 years.\n\nOver the next four decades, more than $20 trillion in additional economic activity and $6 trillion in new tax revenue.\n\nThe oil and natural gas industry supports 10 million high-paying Americans jobs and can create another 400,000 new jobs per year. This exploration will also create a resurgence in American manufacturing — dramatically reducing both our trade deficit and our budget deficit.\n\nCompare this future to Hillary Clinton’s Venezuela-style politics of poverty.\n\nIf you think about it, not one idea Hillary Clinton has will actually create a single net job or create a single new dollar to put in workers’ pockets.\n\nIn fact, every idea Hillary has will make jobs disappear.\n\nHillary Clinton’s agenda is job destruction. My agenda is job creation.\n\nShe wants to tax and regulate our workers to the point of extinction.\n\nShe wants terrible trade deals, like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that will empty out our manufacturing.\n\nDuring her time as Secretary of State, she surrendered to China – allowing them to steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.\n\nShe let them devalue their currency and add more than a trillion dollars to our trade deficit.\n\nThen there was Libya.\n\nSecretary Clinton’s reckless Libya invasion handed the country over to ISIS, which now controls the oil.\n\nThe Middle East that Clinton inherited was far less dangerous than the Middle East she left us with today.\n\nHer reckless decisions in Iraq, Libya, Iran, Egypt and Syria have made the Middle East more unstable than ever before.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy legacy is chaos.\n\nHillary Clinton also wants totally open borders in America, which would further plunge our workers into poverty.\n\nHillary’s open borders agenda means a young single mom living in poverty would have to compete for a job or a raise against millions of lower-wage workers rushing into the country, but she doesn’t care.\n\nMy agenda will be accomplished through a series of reforms that put America First:\n\nEnergy reform that creates trillions in new wealth.\n\nImmigration reform that protects our borders and defends our workers.\n\nTax reform that brings millions of new jobs to America.\n\nRegulation reform that eliminates stupid rules that send our jobs overseas.\n\nWelfare reform that requires employers to recruit from the unemployment office – not the immigration office.\n\nTrade reform that brings back our manufacturing jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.\n\nThere is one more thing we must do to make America wealthy again: we have to make our communities safe again.\n\nViolent crime is rising in major cities across the country. This is unacceptable. Every parent has the right to raise their kids in safety.\n\nWhen we put political correctness before justice, we hurt those who have the least. It undermines their schools, slashes the value of their homes, and drives away their jobs.\n\nCrime is a stealth tax on the poor.\n\nTo those living in fear, I say: help is coming. A Trump Administration will return law and order to America. Security is not something that should only be enjoyed by the rich and powerful.\n\nBy the way, I was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, and we are not going to let Hillary Clinton abolish the 2nd amendment, either.\n\nMy reform agenda is going to bring wealth and security to the poorest communities in this country.\n\nWhat does Hillary have to offer the poor but more of the same?\n\nIn Chicago, for instance, one-fourth of young Hispanics and one-third of young African-Americans are unemployed.\n\nMy message today to all the people trapped in poverty is this: politicians like Hillary Clinton have failed you.\n\nThey have used you.\n\nYou need something new. I am the only who will deliver it.\n\nWe are going to put America back to work.\n\nWe are going to put people before government.\n\nWe are going to rebuild our inner cities.\n\nWe are going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous.\n\nThe choice in November is a choice between a Clinton Agenda that puts Donors First – or a new agenda that puts America First.\n\nIt is a choice between a Clinton government of, by and for the powerful – or a return to government of, by and for the people.\n\nIt is a choice between certain decline, or a revival of America’s promise.\n\nThe people in charge of our government say things can’t change.\n\nI am here to tell you that things have to change.\n\nThey want you to keep trusting the same people who’ve betrayed you.\n\nI am here to tell you that if you keep supporting those who’ve let you down, then you will keep getting let down for the rest of your life.\n\nI am prepared to kick the special interests out of Washington, D.C. and to hand their seat of power over to you.\n\nIt’s about time.\n\nTogether, we will put the American people first again.\n\nWe will make our communities wealthy again.\n\nWe will make our cities safe again.\n\nWe will make our country strong again.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen: We will make America Great Again.\n\nhttps://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/an-america-first-energy-plan\n\nEnergy
