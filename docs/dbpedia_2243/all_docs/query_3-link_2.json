        "text": "Almaty. November 30. KazTAG – Rasul Rysmambetov. Kazakh media regularly rise the topic of Chinese threat and expansion. However, the main cause of the discussion is not the pressure of Chinese companies in Kazakhstan, but more the “holes” in the Kazakhstan legislation on protection of the national security, as well as the sluggishness of negotiators, who protect economic interests of the Republic in relations with our great neighbour. Moreover, Chinese companies often have to lobby for their interests in Kazakhstan in a “traditional” way, which seems good to our officials.\n\nRecently China held the 18th Congress of the Communist Party, where the next leader of China Xi Jinping was officially presented. The congress also announced the priorities of the country’s development for the period until the 19th Party Congress.\n\nXi Jinping was also appointed as the Chairman of the Central Military Commission (WHC) of the PRC, replacing Hu Jintao. In accordance with the Chinese political tradition, in the spring of 2013, Xi Jinping will be elected as the President of the PRC, and will become a leader of Kazakhstan's largest neighbouring country.\n\nWhat goals the Chinese policy in Kazakhstan will follow, what methods Chinese financial and economic structures will use – these are the most important questions for all Kazakhstanis. Without exaggeration, China already determines our future, and their role in the country will continue to grow. And given deficiencies in our legislation and moral values of our officials, the rapid growth of China’s influence in Kazakhstan is provided.\n\nChina has hundreds of priorities and thousands of objectives\n\nThe main aim of the Chinese leadership is to maintain the leading role of the Communist Party and its unity. The major scandal with one of the candidates to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of China, one of the most charismatic politicians Bo Xilai, shattered the unanimity of the Chinese elite. Bo Xilai, the son of Bo Yibo, is one of the “eight immortals” (eight largest and most prestigious members of the CCP), has been charged with several crimes after his active work as the Party Secretary in Chongqing.\n\nThe case of Bo Xilai was one of the reasons why the PSC was reduced from nine to seven members: to show unity and prevent “wandering” among 83 million Chinese communists, many of whom openly sympathized to the success of “Chongqing model”, implemented by Bo Xilai in the town.\n\nIn the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), China continued to actively rearm PLAC (People's Liberation Army of China), and in the autumn 2012 China became an aero-carrier empire. At the moment, China has up to 6 aircraft carriers, which will protect the trade routes to Africa and the Persian Gulf. The country is actively working on a carrier-based aircraft and numerous modifications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These new units are to be coordinated with the help of the global navigation system “Beidou”: a group of more than 30 satellites, half of which is already orbiting Earth. China announces the launch of “Beidou” over the Asia-Pacific region from 2013, and globally – in 2020.\n\nAt the same time, the refusal of China's to export rare earth metals, development and strengthening of own microarrays, and activation of launches of “weather” satellites let us assume that the “Beidou” will be ready for global objectives by 2015. Then the system will have a military and intelligence bias – before the official launch.\n\nA shift from exports to satisfaction of the domestic demand was declared the major economic priority for the 12th Five-Year Plan of China.\n\nAlso, a special attention was paid to the development of the regional economy, including the western region of China, bordering Kazakhstan. According to the Deputy Minister of Trade Wang Chao, the regional development strategy is: “first of all we need to develop the east, settle the West, and raise the northeast.”\n\nThe largest country in the world has hundreds of priorities, thousands of aims and millions of objectives, which China makes no secret of. However, they cannot be covered in one article. Economic plans of China, related specifically to Kazakhstan, I can mention the agricultural strategy, changes in the energy industry of the country, the production of arms, as well as lobbying the Chinese manufacturers of communications.\n\nHot embraces of China\n\nImplementation of plans of our neighbour country will have an impact on the internal situation in Kazakhstan as well. One book says: “Tiger lets its claws, not thinking of them, but the victim cannot escape. Dragon uses his force without noticing it, but the mountain cannot resist.”\n\nThe most massive point for us is the “Energy 12th Five-Year Plan” of China. Under this plan China will continue shifting to gas, nuclear and petroleum economy from the current coal (90% of coal is produced in the mines, 10% in open way). Despite the large reserves of coal in China, most of the mines have already reached the maximum depth, and frequent accidents indicate that China has reached a technological limit in coal mining. In 2011-2015, China will produce at least 3.9 billion tons of coal, and in the 13th Five Year Plan the country can achieve even 5-5.5 billion tonnes, considering the current rate of development.\n\nThe cost of domestic coal is increasing, despite the fact that China receives about 70% of the energy from it. Therefore, although Chinese companies are considering coal deposits in Mongolia and Kazakhstan, the main challenge for China will be a manifold increase of its own gas production and organization of gas purchases in Central Asia and Russia. And the same can be said of the oil.\n\nTherefore, China pays particular attention to shale gas. China's Ministry of Finance announced a subsidy of 0.4 yuan per cubic meter of shale gas, not including regional subsidies. And the country plans to increase the annual production of shale gas to 6.5 billion cubic meters by 2015 and to achieve commercialization of the production of this type of gas in the period of 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020 years).\n\nIn my opinion, this is the unofficial reason, why the Government of Kazakhstan, despite the abundance of own natural gas resources, suddenly posed the objective for the development of the expensive shale gas. Moreover, the former Prime Minister of Kazakhstan offered Kazakhstan companies “to find a partner with the experience.”\n\nChina also increases the capacity of the gas pipeline “East-West”, which brings natural gas from Central Asia to densely populated areas of the country. This indicates that in addition to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, our officials have decided to significantly increase gas supply in the pipeline Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan-China, which was built and will be expanded on money borrowed from the Chinese Development Bank.\n\nOf the last gas purchases of China in Kazakhstan one can name the deposit Urikhtau, supplying gas to the gas pipeline Kazakhstan-China through pipeline Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent, which was also built on credit by the Chinese side. As of 2008 Urikhtau stocks amounted to 40 billion cubic meters of gas and 8 million tons of oil. And in 2011, the head of “KazMunaiGas” Kairgeldy Kabyldin announced that a preliminary assessment of the potential of the field was 200 million tons.\n\nChina will also continue to work in the Kazakh oil fields, and is likely to increase the current 25-30% of the total production in Kazakhstan. By the way, the oil from Urikhtau will be easy to transport to China via the half-empty Atasu-Alashankou pipeline.\n\nNot counting the existing Chinese assets in Kazakhstan oil, one could note the role of JSC “KazMunaiGas Exploration Production” in increasing the shares of China.\n\nLast year we wrote that KMG EP got access to the full geological, geophysical and economic data on a number of oil and gas projects. And Kabyldin did not exclude the transfer of shares in Kashagan in KMG, to a public company, in which 11% is owned by China Investment Corporation, and some share – to shareholders, who not to be revealed, because they are in managing Bank of New York.\n\nAgainst this background, the appointment of a Chinese manager Sinyun Sun as the head of JSC “MangystauMunaiGaz” looks logical. The owner of “MangistauMunaiGaz” cannot be revealed because of non-disclosure of the ownership structure of MMG - Offshore Trust Mangistau Investment B.V.\n\nMoreover, recently Bloomberg told that if Kazakhstan does not approve the project to increase production at Kashagan, Exxon Mobil and Shell have promised to leave the project. And if the two main partners of NCOC (North Caspian Operating Company – a consortium operator of Kashagan) leave the project, it will open the door for direct entry of Chinese companies. In this case, with increasing production at Kashagan to 1 million barrels per day, China's share of our oil will be over 50%.\n\nThus, China has good prospects for oil in Kazakhstan.\n\nClaws of Dragon for Snow leopard\n\nChina also considers Kazakhstan as a potential market for the sale of weapons.\n\nChina has a thing to offer: during the visit of the Kazakhstan military delegation, our experts have highly appreciated opportunities of Chinese small arms. The PLAC military equipment also suited for operations in conditions close to Kazakhstan’s.\n\nIf China offers us to buy the drones, then most likely, we will have to buy them. In 2011, , several Israeli UAVs were placed on Boralday airfield near Almaty in anticipation of attention MoD of Kazakhstan. However, the Russian lobby was stronger. Russian partners strongly opposed, and sold to our armed forces their own unmanned systems “Irkut”, analogues of which are in the public sale in Almaty under the names “Sunkar”. (netstyle.kz / index.php? p = data & lang_id = 1 & id = 9 & lv = 2)\n\nThe Chinese UAVs’ schemes have Israeli counterparts, they are inferior to them in all respects, but they still surpass the Russian samples.\n\nBy some estimates, next year China may adopt UAVs “Pterodactyl” with 20 hours of flight and 200 kg payload. Despite the setbacks in 2011, the Chinese engineers have succeeded in 2012.\n\nAt the same time, China continues to train Kazakh troops, including military-technical sphere.\n\nBesdies, China's Huawei and ZTE continue selling its equipment in Kazakhstan. The customers of these companies in Kazakhstan are the mobile operators, as well as a number of large private and public enterprises.\n\nEarlier, the special U.S. commission voiced report that Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE are a threat to the national security.\n\n“American companies should avoid doing business with two leading Chinese technology companies – Huawei and ZTE, because they pose a threat to the U.S. national security,” the Associated Press reported, citing the findings of the Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence service.\n\nThe report of the parliamentary committee stated the components and programmes in Chinese equipment supplied in the U.S. can let Beijing interfere with important to the national security technology systems in times of a crisis or a war.\n\nIt is hard to believe the defence of Kazakhstan is based on complex computer systems, but the fact that mobile operators use Chinese equipment should be the first warning call for our officials.\n\nIt is known that the political and economic elite of Kazakhstan finds it fashionable to use cellular phones, registered with European operators, in particular the German ones. However, any signal passes through Kazakhstan base stations, where it can be recorded in detail, decrypted and sent via the Internet to anywhere in the Earth.\n\nSince one cannot stop the pervasion of the Chinese giants in Kazakh communication systems, these facts should just be taken into account.\n\nTo feed half a billion\n\nChina also plans to accelerate the growth of agriculture in their 12th Five Year Plan. The country is actively seeking sources of fertilizer to increase yields, and Chinese scientists are working on their own patterns of GMOs, so as to be independent from the dangerous western developments, and feed almost half a billion of people.\n\nIn this regard, one might recall the scandal with the publication of data on the probability of rent by Chinese farms of 1 million hectares of land in Kazakhstan. Then, according to the information revealed by media, our officials had planned to create a joint company on the basis of SEC (Almaty, Zhambyl, Kyzylorda oblasts) for the cultivation of soybean, rapeseed and corn that would be processed and transported to China. The indignation of society only suspended, but not entirely cancelled the project. (Kaztag.kz/ru/viewpoints/158? Page = 13)\n\nCompanies Oriental Patron Financial Group and Jilin Grain Group did not disappear. OPFG, after their first meeting with the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan at the end of October 2008, prepared the necessary project and was waiting in the wings. After the publication of the planned deal in Kazakhstan, Chinese companies have not announced the revision of plans.\n\nMoreover, August 25, 2010, Oriental Patron and China Investment Corporation have established a joint venture to invest in Kazakhstan. The parties contributed $16.5 million in the share capital in six months after the storm of indignation.\n\n(oriental-patron.com.hk/eng/html/information/press_content.php? id = 5)\n\nThe partners have not announced officially they refused to lease the land in Kazakhstan, so we can conclude that the plans of the Chinese state-owned Jilin Grain Group are still in force. And it is confirmed by the report of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), published in August 2012:\n\n“Among confirmed Chinese projects, there are very large ones. One of them is a project on 1 million hectares of land in Kazakhstan by the Chinese state-owned Jilin Grain Group: soybeans production. The project is at the stage of preparation for implementation.”\n\nBy the way, in 2012, Kazakhstan has created LP “Management holding “MaZhiKo” (oil, grease, food), headed by Arman Evniev, who stepped down as the vice-Minister of agriculture in August 2010.\n\nIn his interview to “Kazakh-Grain” Evniev said “MaZhiKo” will help to develop production and processing of soybeans, corn, canola and other oilseeds in Kazakhstan. (Kazakh-zerno.kz/index.php? Option = com_content & task = view & id = 66031):\n\n“Our company, the holding “MaZhiKo” is basically the same as the Food Corporation, only at the market of corn and soybeans,” he said. And any Kazakh farmer knows the effect of the Food Corporation, since they faced it.\n\nThe former vice-Minister of Agriculture also said the programme of “MaZhiKo” plans to invest in the infrastructure market and in the amount of $1.5 billion from various sources, and it is also looking for partners and customers. “It may be a German, European, Chinese, Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian producer. Now we are on the stage of choice.”\n\nIn Kazakhstan, there is still no ban on the possession of land by a foreign company, if it has registered 100% Kazakhstan “daughter”. Therefore, the initiative of “MaZhiKo” can be beneficial to the Chinese consumer of soybeans. And China may be the most profitable client of the “programme of Evniev”, if his long-awaited initiative is not converted into something else at the request of prominent lobbyists.\n\nFrom economics to geopolitics\n\nAccording to the analyst Artem Ustimenko, Chinese initiatives in Kazakhstan are not beyond the scope of the economic strategy yet. China is ready to cultivate other people's land, to invest in a foreign country and bring the light of their own culture, trying to help us understand their logic, using the method of gradual accumulation of power and influence.\n\nPeople's Republic of China is gradually building a system of Kazakhstan's dependence on the Chinese economy. Not considering Kazakhstan as a partner, but as an “object of projecting own foreign policy interests”, China is preparing the ground to protect their priorities in our country from other major world players.\n\nGiven the transition of China to oil and gas, nuclear and wind energy, the construction of the road “Western China-Western Europe”, the planned creation of a Eurasian Union, there is a need to increase its influence in Kazakhstan to the geopolitical. But the creation of the Eurasian Union can greatly meet the demands of China, the economy of which is able to absorb all the three countries, and set us as the pantry of minerals and farmland. One should not forget that Russia and Kazakhstan have large planting areas, and it is a profitable asset for any large corporation. By the way, the Russian media reported Chinese farmers lease about 400 thousand hectares in the Far East.\n\nBy colliding the interests of Russia and the U.S in our region, China is increasing its influence in the margins of the internal policy of Kazakhstan. At the same time, China is interested in a stable and obedient Kazakhstan more than any other country. Whereas Russia's interests in Kazakhstan are originally political: to prevent the radicalization or Americanization of the neighbour country, China sees us as a “pantry” with minimal risks in the delivery of raw materials.\n\n“China is able to control the world's resources more efficiently than any other country on the planet, so it should lead the world. And the People's Liberation Army of China is to defend the sovereignty of China outside the country, and not rely on the defence of its territory,” from the book “China is unhappy” published in 2009 in China.\n\nIn order to make the difference between the economic and geopolitical approach clear, I can give an example of difference between a pantry and a living room. When an apartment needs to be extended, the pantry is turned it into a residential area, and then inhabited.\n\nWho is to blame, what to do?\n\nChina has a clear vision of the role of Kazakhstan in Central Asia, as well as their economic plans. We have the state programme and the orders of the President that are not being executed. But China strictly adheres to its terms and plans, so the strategy of China in Kazakhstan is stronger than our own development programmes.\n\nTo sum up, it must be said that China will continue to settle in Kazakhstan, making our country comfortable, first of all, to themselves. Now we are only a pantry of Chinese sources. To guarantee we turn into a reliable asset, China needs to make our internal policies predictable. And Ak Orda is well aware of these plans of China for the next decade.\n\nOur Government must decide, whether we agree with the Chinese views on Kazakhstan, or there is a real alternative, which we have the brains and perseverance to go for. We have state programmes – plans on development of all sectors – but, as already mentioned – they are not being executed.\n\nKazakhstan in the ocean of opportunities\n\nChina is the ocean that we cannot cut off from. But an ocean is not only a threat, but also an opportunity. The ship, called Kazakhstan, has a real opportunity to use the facilities of navigation in the Chinese reality, as well as a real danger of drowning. It is not the ocean’s fault, if a bad ship sinks, especially, if its team chooses themselves either to perform or ignore the instructions of the captain.\n\nChina's economic expansion is the same irresistible thing as an upcoming ocean or the wind blowing constantly, like the one blowing on the border between our countries through the Jungar gate. This poses the objective for state officials not to refuse the benefits of cooperation, but build relations with the partner on the basis of own national interests. The key word here is “national”, not personal, which is almost always at odds with the national.\n\nAn AIDS patient can die from the simplest disease. The issue is not the expansion of some country to Kazakhstan. The immune system of our country is too dependent on the opaque state decisions, unaccountable to the society and the media.\n\nWe learn about hundreds of major strategic decisions years later they have been made, sometimes from random sources. We are in danger of a weak immune system, not diseases around us. The question is: what stage of the disease we are at? Or how much independent existence for the Republic of Kazakhstan is there..."
