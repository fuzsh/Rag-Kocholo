        "text": "From the recent news of Kazakhstan creating new four gas plants, the resolution of the dispute with Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati to the cancellation of the Kazakhstan MotoGP round, Kazinform News Agency provides a weekly review of Kazakhstan’s coverage in foreign mass media.\n\nThe Times of Central Asia: Four new gas processing plants to be commissioned in Kazakhstan\n\nAccording to the Times of Central Asia, four new gas processing plants will be gradually operated in Kazakhstan until 2030. The Ministry of Energy forecasts, the volume of marketable gas production in Kazakhstan will steadily grow from 22.5 billion cubic meters in 2023 to 36.6 billion cubic meters by 2030.\n\nTo attract investment in the exploration and development of new gas fields, QazaqGaz and Chevron signed an agreement on joint implementation of geological exploration works at the Zhalibek area in the Aktobe region. The Road Map aims to increase the resource base of marketable gas. In 2023, the Rozhkovskoye, Urikhtau Vostochny, and Anabai fields, which have total recoverable gas reserves of 35.5 billion cubic meters, were put into commercial operation.\n\nFour gas processing plants are planned for commissioning from 2026 to 2030: two at the Kashagan field with annual capacities of 1 and 2.5 billion cubic meters (Qatari investor UCC Holding was involved), one at the Karachaganak field with a capacity of 4 billion cubic meters per year, and KazGPZ in Zhanaozen with a capacity of 900 million cubic meters per year.\n\nReuters: Kazakhstan, Stati settle after protracted legal dispute\n\nReuters reports that the government of Kazakhstan and Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati have ended a lengthy legal battle that at one point saw the assets of the Kazakh sovereign fund frozen in the West, the Justice Ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nIt gave no details of the settlement, but said it would require no extra budget spending.\n\nStati, his son Gabriel and their companies have said they were subjected to harassment by Astana, aimed at forcing them to sell their Kazakh investments cheaply.\n\nKazakhstan denied the accusations and refused to pay a $500-million arbitration award, prompting the Statis to file enforcement lawsuits in several European countries, leading to the large-scale freezing of Kazakh assets.\n\nLonely planet: The best ways to get around vast Kazakhstan\n\nLonely planet reports that alternating between steppes that lead dreamers into the wild, and bustling, flashy cities like Astana and Almaty, Kazakhstan is a country that always has something new to reveal.\n\nThe distances are enormous in the ninth-largest country on Earth – and the transport options numerous. Count on a mix of trains, cars, buses and even horses to take in the vast and varied landscapes here.\n\nCities like Astana, Almaty, Aktau, Aktobe, and Shymkent have reliable bus networks. In the current and former capitals, buses are easily identifiable and you can use a prepaid card in Almaty for a 90 tenge fare, or 150 tenge with cash. A monthly pass costs 7200 tenge ($15.50) for unlimited bus and metro rides.\n\nIn smaller cities and outskirts, marshrutkas (private minibuses) operate with less reliability. They seat 15-30 people, often play the driver's music, and have cramped back seats.\n\nFor quick travel, use taxis or Yandex, a rideshare app with fixed prices payable by cash or card. For example, airport rides cost about 4000 tenge ($8.50) in Astana and 5000 tenge ($10.70) in Almaty. A trip to Shymbulak ski town from Almaty costs around 3000 tenge ($6.40) each way.\n\nKazakhstan’s vast steppes are best seen from a train. All major cities have rail connections, with night trains offering a fun experience. The trains range from vintage to modern, and you can check the model when booking online. For holidays like Nauryz or high summer season, book about a week in advance.\n\nTip: Bottom bunks on night trains are popular and often booked over a week ahead. They allow you to sleep and sit upright and provide easy access to baggage storage.\n\nFor short trips between cities like Astana and Karaganda, take a marshrutka. Comfortable coaches now connect Almaty with Bishkek, and sleeper buses run between Almaty and Ürümqi, China, where visa-free stays of up to two weeks are available for many passport holders.\n\nTip: Marshrutkas may or may not have set timetables, depending on demand. Some routes have a few buses daily, while others have multiple departures per hour, leaving when full. For accurate schedules, visit the bus station, and check departure times for long-haul buses the night before.\n\nKazakhstan’s wild steppes and remote Altai Mountains aren’t accessible by public transport. Rent a 4x4 through a local travel agency or hire a driver for around 20,000 tenge ($43) per day, plus their food and lodging for multi-day trips.\n\nFor remote mountain areas like those near Almaty or the Aksu-Zhabagly Nature Reserve, consider horseback riding. Expect to pay about 22,000 tenge ($47) per day for a horse and guide, with packages including accommodations and meals starting at 33,000 tenge ($70) per day.\n\nPublic transport isn’t very accessible for travelers with disabilities. Train corridors are too narrow for wheelchairs, and buses lack lifts. Private transport through Yandex or hiring a driver is recommended for better accommodation.\n\nCrash: Official: Kazakhstan cancelled, Misano to host back-to-back MotoGPs\n\nCrash reports that the already postponed from June to September, the inaugural Kazakhstan MotoGP round has been officially cancelled and replaced by a second visit to Misano.\n\nSokol thus becomes the third event to drop off the planned 2024 MotoGP calendar after Argentina and India. India was the event Kazakhstan had been pencilled in to replace, on September 20-22.\n\n“Operational and logistical issues arising from the earlier flooding across the region have rendered the event impossible to hold in 2024,” read a statement from the FIM, IRTA and Dorna Sports.\n\nBut the world championship will still have 20 rounds with Misano getting a second MotoGP event on the planned Kazakhstan date.\n\nThe additional Misano round will be known as the Emilia Romagna MotoGP, reviving a title used for repeat events at the circuit during Covid.\n\nThe calendar change means Misano will host the San Marino MotoGP (round 13) as planned on September 6-8, followed by an official post-race test on September 9th and a weekend off. The new Emilia Romagna event (round 14) will then take place on September 20-22.\n\nThe first of the flyaway rounds, in Indonesia, starts just five days later in Mandalika.\n\nHungary’s Balaton Park Circuit was listed as a surprise “Reserve Event” for the 2024 MotoGP season but appears not to have been an option to replace any cancelled rounds."
