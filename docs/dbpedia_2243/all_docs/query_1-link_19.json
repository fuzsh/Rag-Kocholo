Ring of Fire Noront’s discovery in 2007 led to an unprecedented staking rush in Northern OntarioIn August 2007, Noront Resources discovered a high-grade nickel-cop- per-platinum-palladium - the Eagle One Discovery - which led to an unprecedented staking rush on the geological structure surrounding it. This area, located in the James Bay Lowlands of Ontario, became known as the Ring of Fire. To date, Noront controls 100% of approximately 48,600 hectares (120,000 acres) and has joint ventures comprised of an additional 68,000 hectares (168,000 acres). This land position represents approxi- mately 30% of the land claims in the Ring of Fire.Since the discovery of Eagle One, Noront has had tremendous explo- ration success in the Ring of Fire.

Belvedere is the only operating nickel miner, and the eighth largest claim holder in Finland. Currently, Belvedere has two operating nickel mines and a large portfolio of advanced gold projects and other prime development assets including nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc and uranium.The Company is well-funded with strong links to the Finnish mining establish- ment. An experienced and innovative management team are extremely capable of capitalizing on its growing assets base. Growth Strategy – From exploration to productionIn 2007, Belvedere made the critical transition from exploration company to a production and development company through the acquisition of the producing Hitura Nickel Mine and the remaining 55% of Finn Nickel. Finn Nickel is an unlisted Finnish company with advanced nickel, copper and cobalt projects in southern Finland. In October 2007, the company also acquired the Luikonlahti mill and concen- trate facility, which is located in eastern Finland close to a number of Belvedere’s 100% owned nickel projects. These recent acquisitions and developments have given Belvedere a significant strategic position in Finland. The company is now pursuing its objective of building substantial shareholder value through low cost, low risk strategies for mine develop- ment as well as growing nickel production to 10,000 tonnes per annum (tpa). Belvedere’s Nickel Producing MinesThe company’s two producing nickel mines – Hitura and Särkiniemi – together cur- rently produce approximately 2,500 tpa of payable nickel.HITURA MINE Belvedere’s flagship operation is the Hitura Mine, with current production of 2,200 tones of nickel per annum and a processing mill with 650,000 tonnes per annum capacity. • Operating since 1970, the mine is historically the largest nickel producer of any in Finland – 14 Mt at 0.6% nickel to date.• Resources and reserves totalling 2.57 Mt nickel ore at 0.67% nickel. • Contained metals 17,300 tonnes nickel, 6,100 tonnes copper.Current Status Belvedere has commissioned a 3.5 million euro (CAN $5M) exploration program at Hitura. To date all previous production has originated from North Hitura. The focus of the new exploration program will be on developing further resources and reserves at the middle and south ore bodies. SÄRKINIEMI MINE A small satellite operation, the Särkiniemi Mine is currently shipping 300 tonnes of ore per day at 1% nickel to Hitura’s mill for processing.• Särkiniemi is an open pit nickel deposit.• Mine opened on time and on budget in June 2007. • Resources Särkiniemi West 116,000 tonnes at 1.17% nickel, 0.53% copper (Indicated). • Resources Särkiniemi East – 60,000 tonnes at 0.86 % nickel, 0.69% copper (Inferred). Current Status Infill drilling continues on the Särkiniemi East deposit, which has an inferred resource at this point of 60,000 tonnes at 0.86% nickel. NICKEL, COPPER, COBALT PROJECTSVALKEISENRANTA Discovered in 2000, the Valkeisenranta Nickel Deposit is located 2 kilometres west of Belvedere’s Särkiniemi Mine. Recent drilling, has identified three orebodies with a combined resource of 1.54 Mt at 0.71% nickel and 0.29% copper. Geochemical stud- ies have indicated that the intrusion is capable of hosting 3 Mt at more than 1% nickel. HAUTALAMPI The Hautalampi cobalt copper project is currently Belvedere’s most significant in the Outokumpu district. Drilling on the project in now underway.RIIHILAHTI The Riihilahti Copper Cobalt deposit is a small deposit located under a lake in a shallow bay, 200 m from the shoreline. The deposit has an indicated resource of 135,000 tonnes at 1.69% copper and 0.14% cobalt.GOLD COPPER PROJECTSIn addition to its Nickel-Copper-Cobalt operations, Belvedere has several advanced gold copper projects: KIIMALA In September 2007, Belvedere announced intersects of a further high grade zone of 5.2 g/t gold over 15.33 metres on its Kiimala gold property.KOPSA In June 2007, drilling completed at Belvedere’s 100% owned Kopsa gold copper property 50 km to the south of Kiimala extended the strike of the Kopsa main zone. KUUSAMO Belvedere is currently waiting for results of drilling completed on Haarakumpu Copper Cobalt Gold project in Kuusamo.

A production-sharing agreement is in place with Sonatrach on the Ledjmet Block and a joint ven- ture, on the Yacoub Block. Upon commercialization of each of the Blocks, a 25 year and 30 year exploitation license for oil and gas respectively will be issued on the Ledjmet Block and a 25 year exploitation license on Yacoub. More than five billion barrels of oil discovered in the last ten years in the Berkine BasinThe Berkine Basin has one of the highest oil and gas exploration success rates in the world. Its exploration potential, pipelines, infrastructure, relatively low exploration costs, and proximity to markets, make the area an ideal region to explore. Geologically, the Berkine Basin has near-perfect petroleum conditions that have resulted in a string of giant oil and gas discoveries. Offsetting First Calgary’s Ledjmet Block is Burlington’s Menzel Ledjmet oil field with 300 million barrels oil (MMBO), Anadarko’s El Merk gas field with 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas (TCF); commercialization starting 2004, and Anadarko’s El Merk oil field with 250 MMBO.

CHOCO 10 MINE FEASIBILITY STUDY The Choco 10 concession is located in the historic El Callao mining district in Venezuela, where over 5 million ounces of gold have been mined historically. The area has recently become the focus of renewed exploration interest and the results suggest that the region still holds significant potential. Between 1990 and 1995, the previous owners spent over $14 million exploring the property with the aim of defining and developing near-surface oxide reserves amenable to heap leaching. During this period 1,288 shallow holes with an average depth of 38 metres were drilled for a total of almost 50,000 metres. These results produced an initial resource of 14.5 million tonnes grading 1.7 grams g/t, containing 795,000 ounces of gold in the measured and indicated category and an inferred resource of 1.7 million tonnes at a gold grade of 1.4 g/t, containing 74,000 ounces of gold. Only six deep holes were drilled into the underlying fresh rock, and all of these holes encountered gold mineralization. In spite of the success of these deeper holes, the ownership of the property changed hands and work on the project was suspended. When Bolivar Gold became interested in acquiring the property, MiconInternational (Micon), an independent technical consulting firm, was retained to review and update the work done previously and to assess the development potential of the property. In their Development Plan dated October 2002, Micon concluded that the existing resource could be readily upgraded by additional drilling and that it was capable of supporting a mine plan based on 4,000 tonnes per day (tpd) to produce approximately 100,000 ounces of gold per year at a cash cost $161 per ounce.Based on these encouraging results, Bolivar Gold embarked on a plan to fast-track development of the property while continuing to explore the potential beneath and adjacent to this resource. A program of confirmation, infill and geotechnical drilling was initiated immediately following acquisition of the property in March 2003.

Corporate Overview Bolivar Gold Corp. is an international gold exploration and devel- opment company focused on highly prospective properties in Venezuela. The company gained prominence in February 2003 after acquiring a 70% interest in the 7,215 hectare Choco 4 and Choco 10 and 15,000 hectare Bochinche Zero, 1 and 2 concessions Bolivar State, Venezuela. Choco 10 Concession The company’s most advanced project is the Choco 10 Concession where one million ounces of gold was previously identified. Exploration activity at Choco 10 began in 1990 with a regional geochemical soil and aeromagnetic survey. This was followed by a ground magnetic survey, a detailed geochemical soil survey and trenching covering five prospect areas. During 1993, a geological survey and a geochemical soil survey carried out within the concession areas disclosed a large gold anomaly covering an area of 1,500 square metres. A shallow drilling program commenced in 1993 to target the large gold anomaly. Over US$14 million had been spent on exploring this property including 1,288 drill holes (49,917 metres) with an average vertical depth of 38 metres. The drilling identified the presence of four major zones of mineralization named as the Coacia, Pisolita and Rosika prospects. More recently, Bolivar Gold has completed and announced an additional 77 infill and exploration holes, with encouraging results. These included 143 metres averaging 2.8 g/t gold and 120 metres at 3.2 g/t. Within these broad zones were numerous high- grade intercepts, the best being 94.5 g/t over 3 metres. Based on the first 46 holes, Micon International has calculated a revised resource estimate of 13.7 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.5 g/t gold repre- senting 1.0 million contained ounces in the indicated category.

Output improves in second half of 2004 Bema’s wholly-owned Petrex Mines are located 50 kilometres east of Johannesburg in the East Rand area of South Africa. It is underlain by the Archean gold-bearing conglomerates of the Witwatersrand basin, the world’s largest gold metallogenic province. Bema acquired its 100% interest in the Petrex mines in February 2003. Petrex consists of three main areas contain- ing several underground operations accessed from eight shafts and a central plant capable of processing 185,000 tonnes of ore per month. All open pit operations were suspended by January 2005 because they were uneconomic in light of the increasing strength of the South African rand against the US dollar. During the first half of 2004, Bema successfully completed a program designed to improve mining efficiencies and cut costs. As a result, tonnes milled, recoveries, rand operating costs, cap- ital expenditures and ounces produced improved during the sec- ond half of the year, and new gold production records were established. However, US dollar operating costs continued to be adversely affected by the strength of the rand. All open pit oper- ations were re-evaluated and the decision was made to suspend open pit mining. In an effort to improve the grade of under- ground ore delivered to the mill, changes were made to control water flow, improve blasting techniques and mining practices, and utilize trackless mining equipment where appropriate. New mining contractors were introduced at several of the shafts and production from old waste dumps was increased. Plant performance continued to improve during 2004 as a result of modifications made in 2003 and the early part of 2004. Recoveries were consistently above 94% in the last four months of the year and have continued at this level into 2005. Capital expenditures of $7.5 million in 2004 were used for underground development, shaft equipment and in the metallurgical plant. In 2005, Bema will pursue all opportunities to improve the economics of the operation. It will continue to restructure its mining contractors and increase their day-to-day supervision, develop into higher grade and higher tonnage areas and continue with efforts to reduce ore losses underground. Exploration is currently focusing on short-term reserve and resource delineation and more medi- um-term resource identification. Drilling in 2004 amounted to 32,720 metres in 318 holes car- ried out at a cost of $1.4 million. Bema believes the Petrex property holds significant potential for adding to reserves and increasing the life of the mines.

SARDINIA The Sardinia gold district has a long history of gold production and is host to the prolific Palaeozoic province, which continues to emerge as a significant gold district in Europe, and to date contains 20 new gold prospects. With the exhaustion of readily-available sources of ore, the company intends to shift its near-term focus to aggressively exploring its extensive land package, while maintaining its flexible, fully-permitted processing facilities at Furtei. The exploration approach will focus on joint ventures with strategic part- ners to fund a significant portion of the exploration and development costs, utilizing their extensive experience and resources to reduce risk and increase opportunities to enhance shareholder value. FURTEI Exploration directed mainly at enargite-gold mineralization associated with the central diatreme, resulted in the discovery of a number of new orebodies. These include the high-grade gold and copper Su Coru deposit and the S’Arruga deposit in 1998 and 1999, both of which were “blind to the surface”. Mining of eight separate oxidized ore depsits ended in 2001 and a transi- tion made to mining sulphide ores. Additional exploration drilling will be carried out on the Su Coru and the Cima-Est prospects. MedOro Resources Ltd. is the suc- cessor to the formerly producing Gold Mines of Sardinia (GMS), with the addition of a Canadian listing, additional funding and a senior joint venture partner as a result of its amalgamation with Full Riches Investments Ltd. Prior to the reor- ganization, GMS, through its 90%- owned subsidiary Sardinia Gold Mining (SGM) had successfully mined numerous near-surface deposits in the Furtei area, as well as accumulating a substantial prospec- tive land position throughout Sardinia.

Under this agreement, the company will earn up to 84% by spending US$2 million and taking the project into feasibility. Local Chinese miners have been operating small- scale on the Xiongwu gold district for more than a decade, mainly exploiting oxidized, near- sur- face gold mineralization with reported grades of 0.5-5 g/t Au with higher grades of up to 10-20 g/t Au. GCR has conducted detailed mapping, soil geo- chemical surveys with planned follow-up drilling when access and ownership issues with local miners are resolved. The company is highly encouraged by the high-grade gold grades in geologically continuous and favourable host rocks. • Beyinhar, Inner MongoliaThe Beyinhar gold project lies within the Inner Mongolia Fold Belt Region, a productive oro- genic belt hosting several skarn, orogenic/meso- thermal veins and porphyry Cu-Au deposits. In 2003, the company entered into a Letter Agreement with Huayu Geological and Mineral Exploration Ltd. (NHE) to explore and purchase the Beiyinhar Gold Project. Under the agree- ment, GCR can earn a 100% interest.The company recently completed a 1770m dia- mond drilling program consisting of a total of 11 widely spaced HQ diamond drillholes (average depth of 160m). The results indicate a continu- ous gold-mineralized zone encouraging enough to warrant a follow-up programin the second half of 2005 totest new targets and move clos-er to defining a resource. Hebei Beijing Inner Mongolia Yunnan Guizhou Guangxi Wangmo Nibao Xiongwu Beyinhar Background to Golden China Resources In February 2005, Golden China Inc. (a merchant bank) amalgamated with APAC minerals (a natural resource company) to form Golden China ResourcesCorporation. Currently, the company has cash and liquid securities in excess of CDN$20 million and is focused on explo- ration and development, operations, and merchant banking in China’s precious metal industry. Immediate growth potential in ChinaGolden China Resources (GCR) is actively capitalizing on its international mining experience, financing expertise, and part- nership with Kingsway Group, a globally focused mid-market financial services provider with affiliations in Hong Kong and mainland China, GCR’s expertise in exploration, develop- ment, and merchant banking is a unique business model for China. With the com- pany’s unmatched combination of proven strengths, GCR intends to increase share- holder value by becoming a major partici- pant and consolidator in China’s develop- ing precious metals sector.THE PROPERTY PORTFOLIOGCR has three major gold proj-ects in China’s Golden Triangle: Nibao, Xiongwu and Wangmo in Guizhou Province hosting signifi- cant Carlin-type gold deposits;and one in Inner Mongolia:Beiyinhar, which is a shear-host-ed gold deposit. Recent resultsfrom these four properties haveindicated multi-million ounce gold resources and the immediate potential for extension of known mineralization.• Nibao, Guizhou ProvinceNibao is GCR’s main gold project and cov- ers a concession area of 11.4 kilometres. The company has a joint venture contract with Guizhou Geology and Mineral Development Corporation and Qianxinan Industry Investment Corporation. Under the JV contract, GCR will earn 84% by spending US$2 million and by bringing Nibao up to development stage through a full feasibility study. As of November 2004, GCR has conduct- ed 8,300m of drilling, culminating in the highly significant Nibao South discovery. Work to date at this discovery area has identified a 3.2 kms-long gold belt con- sisting of several Carlin-type mineralized zones with high-grade drillcore Au values up to 15.03 g/t Au, totaling 3.45 million ounces of contained gold. The intervening undrilled area between zones produced surface channel samples with high-grade gold (5-22 g/t Au) results.The next phase of drilling will delineate an indicated gold resource at the Nibao South discovery area and test valid targets generated from the geological and geo- chemical surveys. GOLDEN CHINA • Wangmo, Guizhou ProvinceCGR’s Wangmo property is close to Sino Gold’s Jinfeng Gold Mine and other gold occurrences such as Yata, Daguan and Louyi. Like the Jinfeng deposit, Wangmo’s gold mineralization is sediment-hosted, displaying characteristics similar to the world-class Carlin deposits in Nevada. CGR has an agreement with the Guizhou Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources covering granted exploration tenements at Wangmo. Under the agreement, CGR will earn 70% interest by spending US$ 1 mil- lion over a three-year period, and can earn a further 14% when the project is taken to bankable feasibility. Exploration work completed during 2004 identified two gold-anomalous catch- ments. Follow-up work in early 2005 to ‘source’ these anomalies revealed that the gold shedding from the anomalous catch- ments is related to siliceous alteration and sulphide mineralization. A trenching pro- gram in the second half of 2005 is pro- posed to better define the extent of gold mineralization. • Xiongwu, Guizhou ProvinceXiongwu is a 15 km-long hydrothermal system with no systematic past exploration (local or foreign). Like Sino Gold’s Jinfeng deposit (3.45 million ounces at 5.1 g/t Au), Xiongwu’s gold mineralization is sediment- hosted similar to the world-class Carlin deposits in Nevada, USA.GCR has entered into an agreement with the Xingyi municipal government to Golden China’sexpertise in exploration, development, and merchantbanking is a unique busi- ness model forChina. China opens up toforeign investmentIn the late 1990s, theChinese government updat-ed its exploration and min-ing law with regulationsmodeled on those ofAustralia and Canada. Theresult has been a consider-able liberalization of foreigninvestment in China’s miningsector. For example, powerto grant mineral titles hasbeen transferred to theprovinces, up to 90% for-eign ownership is nowallowed, and generous taxincentives for mining invest-ment introduced. The Golden Triangle of Southern China The precious metal rich Golden Triangle in southern China consists of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guizhou provinces (GCR has three gold properties in Guizhou). The United States Geological Survey considers this highly prospective area to have the resource potential comparable to the multi-1,000-tonne Carlin-type gold resource in northern Nevada. Sino Gold’s recent announcement of a gold resource on their Jinfeng deposit at Guizhou of 3.5 million ounces at 5.1 g/t Au supports the area’s potential.

During 2007 Oilexco was awarded interest in sev- eral new projects during the 24th Licensing Round.BLUEBELL Oilexco was awarded a 75% working interest in Blocks 15/24a and 15/25f in February 2007 in the 24th Licensing Round. Oilexco has committed to re-process 100 square kilometres of existing seismic data. Bluebell is situated within a Paleocene channel complex can be mapped on seismic.This channel complex anomaly sprawls across the eastern portion of Block 15/24a into Block 15/25f near the 15/25-4 well. The 15/25-4 well appears to be drilled on the edge of the channel complex and contains clean, fine- grained sandstone. Oil may be stratigraphically trapped within portions of this channel complex. CATCHER The Catcher prospect (Block 28/9 and Block 28/10a) was awarded 50 percent equity interest in the 24th Licensing Round. Oilexco has a firm commitment to drill a well to the Paleocene Forties Formation within the next four years. The Company holds a 50% equity interest in the prospect and are the designated operator of the license. Catcher is a four-way dip closure at the Forties level within an undrilled Forties/Tay Formation deep water turbidite feeder system. Block 28/9 and Block 28/10a are part of the same turbidite feeder system which contains 120 million barrels of oil and 120 Bcf of gas from the Bittern Field down dip from Catcher.DANICA Oilexco was awarded a 100% equity interest in Danica (Block 29/6a) and has commit- ted to drill a firm well to the Lista Formation within the next four years. Block 29/6a is located in the southwest corner of the West Central Graben, with the Danica prospect located on the upthrown side (West Central Graben Platform) of the main basin- bounding fault. A sandstone injection complex in the Paleocene Balder level is evident on the 3D seismic survey. This sandstone injection complex is similar to that encoun- tered at Gryphon, Balder, Jotun, Grane, Hamsun, Chestnut and Alba Fields. In 2008 Oilexco’s capital budget is US $707 million—US$400 million on develop- ment and US$300 million on exploration and appraisal.

Political Stability EstablishedThe election of President Olusegun Obasanjo's administration in 1999 returned Nigeria to civilian rule. In April 2003, Obasanjo was re-elected with 61% of the vote, affording Nigeria a basic level of political stability. A Growing EconomyNigeria's Real GDP grew at around 4.2% in 2003. The economy is heavily dependent on hydrocarbons extraction, which accounts for: • 90-95% of export revenues• Over 90% of foreign exchange earnings • Nearly 80% of government revenues. In 2004, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed hope about Nigeria because the government seems to have adopted tighter fiscal policies and has saved revenues from recent oil earnings. International reserves were also up in 2004.Reforms and PrivatizationNigeria's post-1999 political climate has brought about a determined privatization program designed to improve the productivi- ty and efficiency of petroleum exploration, production, distribution and marketing. The government, through its 100% state- owned national oil company Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has had overall control of the industry. Under the privatization program seven NNPC sub- sidiaries are to be sold and state-held refineries are slated for privatization. The Oil SectorSince 1999, the democratically elected gov- ernment has done much to restore confi- dence in the oil sector. Currently, Nigeria is the world's fifth largest oil producer and a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).Current Oil ProductionMost of Nigeria’s crude oil production, com- prising 10 major crude streams, is light sweet crude with API grades 21-45 and a low sul- phur content. • In 2003, Nigerian crude oil production averaged 2.1 million barrels per day (bbl/d). • As of August 2004, OPEC raised Nigeria’s production quota to 2.14 million barrels per day in the face of record-high crude oil prices. Onshore Oil ReservesEstimates of Nigeria's proven oil reserves range from 25 billion to 35.2 billion barrels. The majority of these reserves are found in relatively simple geological structures along the country's coastal Niger River Delta, but newer reserves have been discovered in deeper waters offshore.Offshore Oil ReservesEstimates of recoverable oil reserves in deepwater geological formations (up to 5000 feet below the surface) range from 8 to near- ly 20 billion barrels. Nigeria's deepwater has already produced substantial discoveries and the bulk of new exploration by major multi- national oil companies is taking place off- shore. Nigeria’s Proven Undeveloped Fields Project presents a major opportunity for growth The CompanyMart Resources Inc. is an international energy company committed to building substantial shareholder value by acquiring, financing and developing oil and gas related assets in West Africa. In so doing, the company will become strategically positioned to capitalize on future expansion in this resource-rich region. The Opportunity - Nigeria’s Proven Undeveloped Fields Project The Nigerian government is playing a leading role in proven undeveloped field devel- opment, and they see it as an effective way to both increase the country’s production and promote domestic participation in the oil and gas industry. Following the transi- tion to civilian government in 1999, the Oil Ministry issued new guidelines for the development of proven undeveloped fields. These called for abandoned or under- exploited fields to be recovered from operators and production rights re-allocated. In 2001, the government offered 24 proven undeveloped fields. The fields could only be awarded to companies incorporated in the country with majority Nigerian owner- ship. Early in 2003, 31 indigenous companies were selected for farm-out and opera- tion of the fields. Mart to Participate in Development of Proven Undeveloped Fields Over the past several years, Mart has been evaluating opportunities to participate in the development of proven but undeveloped oil and gas fields in Nigeria under the Nigerian Marginal Field Allocation Program. Under the Program, which was intro- duced by Nigerian government decree in 1996, a total of 116 proven but undeveloped fields were designated as “marginal”, meaning that the fields were believed to hold commercial quantities of hydrocarbons but were considered to be too small to be commercially exploitable by multinational oil companies under historical fiscal regimes. According to published reports, these fields may hold an esti- mated two billion barrels of oil, and reports suggest that proven unde- veloped fields have the potential to add over 150,000 barrels per day to Nigeria's oil production.Mart has undertaken detailed technical and commercial evalua- tions on 10 of the 24 fields allocated, and has entered into commercial discussions on five of these fields. Mart has con- centrated its efforts on those fields located in close proximity to existing infrastructure, allowing for short development times and early cash flow generation. Many of the wells in these fields were drilled in the 1970s and 1980s on the basis of outmoded 2D seismic; however, most of the fields being evaluated by Mart are covered by more modern 3D seismic data, which provides much improved definition of the proven reservoirs as well as the upside exploration potential in and around the fields. Mart has formed strategic partnerships with indigenous Nigerian companies – all successful bidders – to jointly develop and finance a number of proven undevel- oped fields. Mart will partner with international industry and financial companies to fund and develop the projects. The company’s indigenous Nigerian partners will be responsible for operational support, infrastructure, logistics, local working knowledge and relationships. Opportunity forMart The major multinationaloil companies are nowconcentrating theirefforts and availablefunds on exploitingNigeria’s huge deepwa-ter offshore potential.This has left Mart and afew other smaller com-panies with the excitingopportunity to partici-pate in development ofthe many low-risk, high-reward oil opportunitiesremaining onshore in theprolific Niger Deltaregion of Nigeria.

Sienna Drilling on the Mina Igor Gold Property The Mina Igor Gold Mining Project is the most advanced of Sienna’s gold opportunities. The Company has identified five target areas for exploration within this high potential gold concession. A drilling pro- gram is underway on one of these target areas (Tesoro 1) and surface and tunnel exploration proceeds on the other four. Mina Igor Gold Mine ProjectThe Mina Igor Gold Property is located in the Yanacocha-Pierina gold belt of Northern Peru, an historic gold mining region dating back to the Spanish colonial era. Access to the site is a five hour road trip from Trujillo, which has mining infrastructure and a skilled workforce. Like Mina Igor, several operating gold mines and deposits in the belt are sandstone-hosted. The previous operator recovered 5,000 ounces of gold by crude vat heap leach methods from 15,000 tonnes of mineral- ized rock in the high-grade breccia zone.Close to world-class gold producers Peru’s largest gold mines, Minera Yanacocha and Pierina Mine are located within 75 kilometres of the Mina Igor property. Together they produced 113.4 tonnes (3.645 million ounces) of gold in 2004. Barrick’s Lagunas Norte Mine in the Alto Chicama, can be seen from the Mina Igor Project (approximate- ly 9.5 kilometres). This mine went into production in 2005 and has reserves of 9.1 million ounces. The Mina Igor Exploration Program & Results The Company has initiated exploration and estab- lished five primary target zones:1. Tesoros 1 Fault and breccia zone 2. Tesoros 2 Fault (Domo)3. Tesoros 3 Fault zone (Callanquitos) 4. Tesoros 1 Fault and breccia zone - Northern extension 5. Lower Intrusive Porphyry zone (Portachuelo & Carmen Alto) THE COMPANY Sienna Gold Inc. is a publicmining company based inCalgary, Alberta. We are focusedon exploration and mine develop-ment in Peru - the world’s sixthlargest gold producer. Our objec-tive is to be a mid-tier miningcompany within five years bycombining Canadian and Peruvianbusiness strengths. Peruviandirectors provide local knowledgeand expertise while Canadiandirectors contribute public com-pany experience and access tofinancial markets. Our key gold prospect is MinaIgor in which we hold 60% withthe option to acquire 100%. Wealso hold options on eight otherproperties, all in Northern Peru. Work is well advanced on the Tesoros 1 Fault and brec- cia zone and sampling has recently commenced on the Tesoros 2 Fault and breccia zone. The Tesoros 1 Fault and breccia zone was extensively sampled within previous workings which range from 2750 meters to 3200 meters above sea level. The aver- age grades for these samples are:location gold g/t silver g/t 3175 Tunnel 5.5 247 3150 Tunnel 3.6 151 3120 Tunnel 1.8 36 14 Lower Tunnels 1.5 63 In late December the Company commenced drilling on the Tesoros 1 exploration area and has completed 300 meters of cor- ing. The drill program is for 1,500 meters of BQ (38 mm) diameter diamond drilling. Additional locations to complete 2,580 meters of drilling have also been identified and will be drilled following completion of the first phase of the program. The Sienna Exploration PlansThe company plans the following exploration program in 2006: 1) Continue drilling of the Tesoro 1 zone 2) Extend geologic mapping on the entire 1,000 hectare con- cession specifically the 4 other target areas that are identi- fied 3) Prepare and submit to the regulatory authorities a Declaracion Jurada (an application) which outlines plans for an additional drill hole program of up to 75 holes. 4) Conduct a preliminary metallurgical study to determine the best technique for silver and gold recovery. Other Prospects Sienna Gold has geologic teams evaluating a further eight properties on which it holds 12 month options: Prospect Target mineralization type Pachin Alto High sulfidation gold system Cerro Blanco VMS copper previously drilled Francisco Josefa Low sulfidation gold system Llipa Old copper mine with high grade polymetallic body Chincha de Huaripampa Copper-zinc skarn Sitabamba Low sulfidation gold system Colcabamba Gold exploration target Huaguil Gold exploration target A Major Gold Producing Country Peru is located on the Western Coast of South America and is the world’s sixth largest gold producer. Mineral resources account for approximately 50% of foreign exchange. Peru is forecast to produce 175 tonnes of gold (5.63 million ounces) in 2005. Democratic GovernmentThe Peruvian government is composed of an executive branch, a single chamber con- gress and a judiciary branch. The President and all congress members are directly elected by popular vote every five years. SIENNA GOLD INC. Stable Exploration & Mining Environment In the 1990s, the Peruvian government made dramatic improvements to the min- ing laws and the current rules and regula- tions are both clear and fair regarding the ownership of mineral rights. Today, most major mining companies have a presence in Peru.

The well went into produc- tion in February 2004 and is currently producing approximately 400 bbls of light crude oil per day. The North Block is serviced by excellent infrastructure, including electrical power lines, a good network of all weather roads and an experienced oil industry work force. The area is crossed by the regional rail oil transportation system and also connected by a new pipeline from Kenkiyak to Atyrau and on to Western European and Russian export markets. Neighbouring FieldsThe North Block and Caspian Energy’s oil and gas properties within the area have significant producing fields nearby:Alibekmola – Nelson Resources 50% - Kazmunaigas 50% In 2000, Nelson Resources purchased a 50% interest in Kazakhoil Aktobe, the Kazakh State Oil Company, KazMunaiGas, owns the other 50%. Alibekmola was discovered in 1987. The field is a large north - south trending anticli- nal fold with a faulted western margin. A total of 24 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled on the field between 1985 and 1994. The estimated remaining proved and probable oil reserves are 206 mmbbl barrels for Alibekmola. Production in 2004 was 16,000 b/d. The Alibekmola field is 15 km north of the Zhanazhol field, operated by Aktobemunaigaz (CNPC) and about the same distance from the Kenkiyak - Orsk pipeline system. A rail link is available just 50 km from the field. A pipeline system now links the Alibekmola Field directly with the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk via the CPC pipeline. The South Alibek Field – Transmeridian 50% The South Alibek field is located to the south-west of the Alibekmola field in the Aktobe. The field covers over 14,000 acres and is surrounded by major producing fields including Alibekmola, Kenkiyak and Zhanazhol. According to McDaniel & Associates Consultants, the oil reserves are estimated at 193 mmbbl. They are located in the KT-2 reservoir, which is identical to producing zones in the Alibekmola and An Emerging Company Aggressively Targeting Growth In September 2004, Caspian Energy Inc (formerly Northway Explorations Ltd.) suc- cessfully completed a merger with Caspian Energy Ltd. In the same month, the com- pany announced that its common shares had been admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange (TSX-V/AIM: CEK). Today, Caspian Energy Inc is a dynamic international oil and gas exploration company focused on exploration and development in resource rich Kazakhstan where it has a number of targets in the highly prospective Aktobe Oblast of Western Kazakhstan. Caspian Energy Acquires 50% of Aral Petroleum Caspian has 50% of Aral Petroleum Capital LLP. The remaining 50% is owned by Azden Management Ltd. (local Kazakh investors). Aral has operated in Kazakhstan since December 2002, and has assembled a management team of both Kazakh and international executives who have extensive experience in the Kazakh operating and regulatory environment.Through its 50% stake in Aral Petroleum, Caspian holds a government-issued explo- ration contract to explore and develop certain oil and gas properties in the ‘North Block’. This area is in the prolific Pre-Caspian basin and lies immediately adjacent to producing fields of Alibekmola, South Alibek, Zhanazhol and Kenkiyak. In March 2005, the government awarded Aral a further 1,110 sq. km. of territory adjacent to the North Block. With this acquisition, the North Block has been expand- ed by 47% from 2,348 sq. km to 3,458 sq. km. Important geophysical information indicates that a series of geological features associated with salt domes that extend from the North Block are within the latest acquisition. Strong Growth StrategyCaspian Energy will employ 3D seismic and the latest western technology to prove up the maximum amount of reserves from the minimum number of wells. Caspian intends to crystallize shareholder value through selected developments or through a targeted program of disposing of its North Block assets at the appropriate stage of development. 2004/2005 Seismic 3D Program Indicates Significant Structures Aral has received preliminary interpreted data from the 3D seismic survey of 400 square kilometres in the Zhagabulak area in the ‘Golden Triangle’ of the North Block. This is prime exploration territory that encompasses the oil-producing Well 213. The government of Kazakhstan has estimated that Zhagabulak has recoverable reserves of 195 million barrels. The preliminary interpretation of the data indicates the presence of significant structures. Drilling of the first well is projected to start at the end of the second quarter of 2005.North Block Proven to Produce Within the North Block, several producing and non-producing oil fields are operated by international and Kazakh companies. Caspian is primarily targeting the Zhagabulak THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN• is located at the eastern margin of the Pre-Caspian Basin – one of the world’s largest untapped hydrocarbon reserves• has reserves of 28 billion barrels of oil and condensate and 106 trillion cubic feet of gas• was projected to produce 1.09 million bopd and 565 billion cu ft of gas by 2004 • isn’t a member of OPEC and therefore not subject to its pro- duction quota system• has a government that encour- ages direct foreign investment in the oil and gas sector.• has an excellent infrastructure of electrical power, roads, rails and pipelines • has an experienced oil industry workforce.

Extensive 2D seismic data was acquired over this area up to 1996, and 3D was acquired in 2001. In 2004 production was estimated at 25,000 - 28,500 barrels p/d. The production rate for the South Alibek Field is 1500 b/d. Aktobe – China National Petroleum Corporation (CNCP) In July 1997 China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) acquired a 60% stake in Aktobemunaigaz, Kazakhstan's second largest oil company. Total CNPC- Aktobe oil production in 2004 was 5 million tons and is expected to rise to 6.7 million tons by 2007. The CNPC acquistion included the Zhanazhol and Kenkiyakfields. Zhanazhol has estimated reserves in place of 398 million tons (2.99 billion barrels) and recoverable reserves of 118 million tons (883 million barrels). Zhanazhol production in 2004 was 95,000 b/d. The Kenkiyak under-salt field was discovered in 1971 but remained undeveloped until CNPC acquired the field. Reserves in place are estimated at 137 million tons (1.03 billion barrels) and recoverable reserves of 44.7 million tons (335 million barrels). CNCP/Aktobe oil production in 2004 was 108,000 b/d. 95,000 b/d were from Zhanazhol and 13,000 b/d were from Kenkyiak. Production is expected to increase to 129,000 b/d by 2006.Pipelines Kenkiyak-Atyrau Oil PipelineIn June 2000, it was announced that KazTransOil was to build a pipeline to transport oil from the Kenkiyak region, and the North Block to Atyrau, to link up with the CNPC and Samara export pipelines. In the longer term, this pipeline is intended to form the first part of the strategic trunk line linking west Kazakhstan and China. There are also additional above salt reserves that are being developed by CNCP. The line was inaugurated on 28 March 2003, although not fully commissioned until late 2003 and was immediately used to deliver Aktyubinskneft crude for export. Capacity expansions to 180,000 and 240,000 b/d are envisaged. Kazakhstan-China Oil PipelineConstruction of the Atasu (rail loading terminal on the Omsk-Pavlodar-Chardzhev line) to Alashankou (Druzhba rail terminal on the Kazakh-China border) section of the Kazakhstan-China pipeline commenced on 28 September 2004, with the first oil expected to be delivered in 2006. The 988 km, 32\" pipeline will have initial capacity of 200,000 b/d and is planned to increase to 400,000 b/d from 2011. CNPC has agreed to fund this initial project, which has been valued by Kazakhstan at US$850 million. Oil from the Precaspian basin, and the North Block may be fed in by reversing the Kenkiyak-Atyrau line (operational) and the Kumkol-Aralsk-Kenkiyak line (proposed). The 752 km. line is scheduled to be in operation on 2011. The 32” pipeline will have an initial capacity of 400,000 b/d.

Falcon™ Airborne GravityGradiometer System revolution- izes exploration Falcon is BHP Billiton’s breakthrough geophysical technology that measures minute changes in the earth's gravity pro- ducing colored maps indicating changes in the earth's density that can give geologists vital clues to the whereabouts of high value ore bodies. Installed onto a light aircraft and flown over prospective mining areas it’s a cost-effective, fast way to explore new terrain. Far West’s Broken Hill-type (BHT) exploration in Queensland Australia has the potential for massive capi- tal appreciation as conceptualized by BHP Billiton. The Georgetown Project area is believed to have the poten- tial to host BHT style mineral deposits such as Broken Hill (280Mt 10.0 % Pb, 8.5 %Zn, 150 g/t Ag) and Cannington (45Mt 11.9% Pb, 4.8 %Zn, 520 %Ag). Area ranks third in the world for BHT mineralisation BHT lead-zinc-silver deposits are high grade, large ton- nage, lead-zinc silver sulphide deposits. Georgetown Province is ranked third globally for silver-rich BHT min- eralisation. There is demonstrated Proterozoic BHT min- eralization to the north, and numerous BHT prospects along the Gilberton Pb-Zn corridor that extends into the project area. Georgetown Exploration Program In May 2005, Far West contracted with Fugro Airborne Surveys Pty. Inc. to carry out a 7,817 line km airborne electromagnetic/magnetic survey over the Georgetown properties. The company is anticipating that at least 10 -12 anomalous targets will be generated for subsequent ground geophysics and drill testing. In 2002-03, Far West entered into an agreement with BHP Billiton to explore for iron-oxide copper-gold (IOCG deposits) in northern Chile’s Candelaria copper belt, which is rated one of the most prospective IOCG provinces in the world. The belt hosts numerous copper deposits including Candelaria (460 million tonnes) and Manto Verde (350 million tonnes). Far West recently completed its 100% earn-in on the Candelaria project from BHP Billiton, which now holds a 2% net smelter return royalty.Falcon gravity survey outlines target areas In 2002, a 10,700 line km Falcon airborne gravity gra- diometer technology was flown along a 300 km strike length of the Candelaria copper belt. The survey out- lined in excess of 76 target areas containing one or more distinct gravity anomalies. 4C Drilling ProgramBetween February 2003 and May 2004, reverse circula- tion (RC) drilling discovered encouraging IOCG mineral- ization in 3 target areas 3d, 4a, and 4c. Drilling in the 4c target in early 2005 encountered widespread IOCG mineralization; however, no priority zone has emerged. 4a (Santo Domingo) Target Area Far West has a 100% interest in three key properties in the Santo Domingo 4a Target Area. The properties are strategically located along the major east-west Santo Domingo fault zone where high grade copper veins, breccias and mantos are exposed. Previous Far West drilling in the 4a target area intersected stock- work/breccia and strata bound manto-style mineraliza- tion of variable grade and thickness for over three kilo- metres along the Santo Domingo fault. Latest drilling on 4a3 cuts significant copper intercepts During the recent drilling campaign (April/May 2005), six holes placed in the Santo Domingo Sur Area intersected significant a mantos structure, or feeder zone, hosting Iron Oxide Copper-Gold (IOCG) mineralization. Reverse circulation (RC) drill hole 22 cut 56 metres from 14 metres below surface grading 0.8% copper, including 14 metres averaging 1.3% copper.Target 4a3 exhibits stacked manto-style mineralization including a deeper intercept of 22 metres from 186 metres below surface grading 0.7% copper. Hole 22 was positioned about 2.5 km southeast of the main east- west Santo Domingo fault. Five other RC holes in the area intersected numerous 20 to 150-metre intercepts averaging 0.7-1.1% copper. The Argentinean Andes are in the top five prospective magmatic arcs in the world for porphyry copper-gold deposit exploration. Porphyry deposits provide more than 50% of the worlds copper supply. Far West is cur- rently exploring for major deposits in the Farallón Negro project in Argentina.Proven deposits in the Farralón Negro project area The Farallón Negro project area has proven large cop- per-gold porphyry potential - Alumbrera (752Mt @ 0.51% Cu & 0.67 g/t Au) - Agua Rica (802Mt @ 0.61% Cu & 0.23 g/t Au). Falcon gravity airborne survey completed Because conventional exploration for massive porphyry copper deposits in much of the Andes is hindered by extensive post mineral cover, Far West employed the advanced Falcon system to survey for world-class por- phyry Cu-Au target areas in the Farallón Negro project. In April 2005, the Falcon airborne survey was complet- ed. The areas surveyed covered 7,270 sq km of the proj- ect area at 800m line spacing and lay to the north and south of the district hosting the major Alumbrera and Agua Rica deposits.The data is currently being processed by BHP Billiton’s Falcon technical team in Australia. It is estimated that 5-8 target areas will be identified for further geological investigation, geochemical sampling, ground geophysics and initial diamond drilling.
