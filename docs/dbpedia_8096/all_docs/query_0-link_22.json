        "text": "Downing Street has insisted David Cameron followed proper procedures after it emerged his Nepalese nanny had been granted British citizenship.\n\nHis spokeswoman refused to confirm whether the prime minister had written to the authorities as an employer supporting Gita Lima's application but disclosed that she had been granted UK citizenship, and said the nanny was \"someone who has come here and works hard and is now a British citizen\".\n\nQuestions were raised about Cameron's use of foreign domestic help after a Tory minister deplored the effects of the \"metropolitan elite\" using cheap migrant workers.\n\nJames Brokenshire, a new Home Office minister, said the wealthy had been the main winners from Britain's openness to labour from abroad, because they had to pay less for tradesmen and services.\n\nThe losers had been ordinary workers whose wages had stagnated, he added.\n\n\"The immigration system we inherited was not designed to benefit this country or the people who live here,\" the Tory minister said in a speech to the Demos thinktank on Thursday.\n\n\"For too long, the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour, or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services, but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country.\"\n\nCameron has employed Lima for several years since recruiting her through Kalayaan, a charity that helps immigrants to escape abusive bosses.\n\nAsked whether Cameron and his wife had chosen their nanny on the basis of cost, the spokeswoman said: \"I think they were guided by someone who would look after their children in the way they wanted to.\"\n\nThe deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, disclosed on Thursday that he employs a Belgian national as a domestic help."
