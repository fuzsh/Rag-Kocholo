        "text": "James Brokenshire’s return to the cabinet as housing and communities secretary just under four months after he left the government for health reasons fulfils his hope at the time that it was a temporary departure.\n\nThe long-time ally of Theresa May stepped down as Northern Ireland secretary in January, saying it was to allow him to receive treatment for a lung lesion.\n\nIt later emerged that Brokenshire had part of his right lung removed during cancer-related surgery. He has since talked about the importance of seeking early diagnosis and treatment for the illness.\n\nThe MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup was back in parliament a month after the surgery, and with his recovery from the operation seemingly secure, it is little surprise to see Brokenshire back in government as part of May’s forced reshuffle following Amber Rudd’s departure. Her role as home secretary has been taken by Sajid Javid, whose communities role has, in turn, gone to Brokenshire.\n\nHaving been in parliament since 2005, Brokenshire might have even expected to replace Rudd were it not for the fact it would have meant his possible prior knowledge of the Windrush crisis and immigration removal targets would have come under scrutiny.\n\nHe spent two years from 2014 as an immigration minister, when May was home secretary, and four years before that as a more junior Home Office minister. He even pre-dated May in covering the area, spending four years from 2006 as a junior shadow home affairs minister.\n\nBrokenshire’s main moment in the limelight came shortly after he became an immigration minister: he lambasted the “wealthy metropolitan elite” for increasing immigration by employing overseas staff. The comments forced David Cameron to explain the immigration status of his family’s Nepalese nanny.\n\nBrokenshire’s close association with May saw him brought into the cabinet when she became prime minister, taking over the difficult brief of Northern Ireland secretary. He tried to resurrect the Northern Ireland power-sharing assembly, which collapsed in the wake of a scandal over money wasted on a renewable heating scheme. Here, Brokenshire was generally viewed as diligent and on top of his brief, if unexciting.\n\nHis new brief is arguably just as precarious. In January, the department had its name changed from the Department for Communities and Local Government to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.\n\nThis emphasised the government’s desperation to tackle the housing crisis, and May has since made a major speech on the issue. However, there is a sense that little has been achieved under Javid.\n\nBrokenshire must also get to grips with the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, over which the government faces intense pressure from Labour and supporters of victims to rehouse those affected and sort out the wider problem of flammable cladding on other high-rise blocks."
