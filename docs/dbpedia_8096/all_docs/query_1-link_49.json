        "text": "Several key members of David Cameron's cabinet have lost their jobs in the British government as Theresa May continues to build her new team.\n\nTheresa Villiers resigned as Northern Ireland Secretary, adding that the \"new Prime Minister was kind enough to offer me a role but it was not one which I felt I could take on\". She has been replaced by James Brokenshire.\n\nMr Brokenshire is an MP for the Old Bexley and Sidcup constituency in greater London. He was previously the UK's immigration minister.\n\nMichael Gove was the first to be sacked as Justice Secretary by the new Prime Minister, joining ex-chancellor George Osborne on the backbenches in a dramatic change to the cabinet team.\n\nMr Gove, whose decision to stand in the Tory leadership race and dash the premiership ambitions of his fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson in what was regarded an act of treachery, wished the new-look cabinet \"the best of luck\".\n\nHe wrote on Twitter:\n\nHot on his heels out the door was Nicky Morgan, who backed his leadership bid.\n\nMs Morgan said she was \"disappointed not to be continuing as education secretary and minister for women and equalities - two wonderful roles it's been a privilege to hold\".\n\nJohn Whittingdale was sacked as culture secretary and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Letwin was also given the boot.\n\nMr Whittingdale said it had been \"a privilege\" to serve in the cabinet, adding: \"I wish my successor every success and will continue to support creative industries.\"\n\nMrs May's leadership rival, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb, also quit \"in the best interests of my family\".\n\nIt was disclosed last week that the married father-of-two had exchanged a number of sexts with a woman in the run-up to the EU referendum.\n\nHe was replaced by Damian Green, a key supporter of Mrs May and a former immigration minister.\n\nMr Gove joins ex-chancellor George Osborne on the backbenches in a dramatic change to the Cabinet team.\n\nAndrea Leadsom, who stood down from the leadership contest on Monday handing the premiership to Mrs May, was put in charge at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nPriti Patel, another prominent Brexit supporter, is now in charge of international development.\n\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has kept his job - despite his failure to solve the junior doctors crisis and reports that he too was on his way out.\n\nAfter meeting with Mrs May, he joked reports of his \"death have been greatly exaggerated\":\n\nThe sackings came as Mrs May returned to Downing Street on Thursday to continue the process of appointing ministers to her new administration.\n\nThe firings followed a slew of appointments last night, which included Boris Johnson being appointed Foreign Secretary and Philip Hammond being made Chancellor.\n\nWho's In?\n\nChancellor - Philip Hammond (previous foreign sec)\n\nHome Secretary - Amber Rudd (previously energy and climate change sec)\n\nForeign Secretary - Boris Johnson\n\nDefence Secretary - Michael Fallon (no change)\n\nSecretary of State for Exiting The European Union - David Davis\n\nInternational Trade Secretary - Liam Fox\n\nJustice Secretary - Liz Truss (previously environment secretary)\n\nEducation Secretary - Justine Greening (previously international development secretary)\n\nTransport Secretary - Chris Grayling (previously leader of the Commons)\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary - Damian Green\n\nEnvironment Secretary - Andrea Leadsom (previously energy minister)\n\nCommunities Secretary - Sajid Javid (previously business minister)\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary - James Brokenshire (previously immigration minister)\n\nBusiness and Energy Secretary - Greg Clark (previously local government minister)\n\nInternational Development Secretary - Priti Patel (previously employment minister)\n\nCulture Secretary - Karen Bradley\n\nWales Secretary - Alun Cairns (no change)\n\nScotland Secretary - David Mundell (no change)\n\nChief Secretary to the Treasury - David Gauke (previously financial secretary to the Treasury)\n\nLeader of the House of Commons - David Lidington (previously Europe minister)\n\nChief Whip - Gavin Williamson\n\nConservative Party Chairman/Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - Patrick McLoughlin (previously transport secretary)\n\nHealth Secretary - Jeremy Hunt (no change)\n\nLeader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans\n\nWho's Out?"
