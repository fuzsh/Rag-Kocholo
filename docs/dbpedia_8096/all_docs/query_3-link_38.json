        "text": "Like Mrs Brokenshire, I lost my husband to lung cancer. Like James, he was a non-smoker and 53. He had the same symptoms; a persistent cough and breathlessness, but the diagnosis took 3 months. He was finally diagnosed on 26th November 2001, and died 3 weeks later, on 21st December 2001. That was over 20 years ago, but I still remember those weeks so vividly. He was the love of my life, and no-one has ever replaced him. I happened to read an article about Cathy and James in the Sunday Telegraph, which triggered me to post this. My very sincere condolences to the Brokenshire family.\n\nPamela 16th February 2022\n\nOn behalf of everyone at Cancer Research UK, we were so sorry to hear of James’ death. He was a great champion of our work and we were delighted to meet with him several times, including welcoming him to The Francis Crick Institute to hear about our TRACERx research programme – a study we hope will transform our understanding of non-small cell lung cancer and take a practical step towards an era of precision medicine. James was hugely passionate about the importance of early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer – something we, at Cancer Research UK, will continue to push. Our thoughts are with James’ friends and family at this time. He will be greatly missed. Michelle Mitchell, CEO and Professor Charles Swanton, Chief Clinician, Cancer Research UK\n\nEmlyn 5th November 2021\n\nI live in Bexley and fought to save the life of my loved one when the authorities kept mis-diagnosing a chronic and debilitating mental health disorder. James Brokenshire supported us for close to a year, advocating in writing on our behalf. His support was unwavering and he engaged with our cause willingly and provoked the NHS to take action when it was most necessary. I'm not sure whether my loved one would be alive without his aid. In memory of The Right Honorable James Brokenshire MP, I will write an article eventually, when the matters at hand are handed over to the judiciary systems, making clear this mans role. He supported the exposing of chronic and institutionalised failures. Although the NHS works for some of us, there are times when the individuals who make up the system need to be held accountable, and James Brokenshire certainly aided in that act of support, even whilst ill, which to our family makes him the hero we called on in our time of need. We are eternally grateful and wish James peace now. We send our sympathies to the family too.\n\nHannah 31st October 2021\n\nI first met James when he attended a hustings meeting run by Churches Together in Sidcup (CTiS) at New Community Church. He was warm and engaging, and over the subsequent years as our local MP has consistently shown support for our local community including churches and other faith groups, Queen Mary's Hospital, the need for a Post Office, and travel to London. He listened to people and helped local residents to overcome red tape when the odds seemed stacked against them. He has been a superb local MP and hardworking minister, yet always had time for individuals and treated people with gentleness and respect. It is testament to his character that he was not only respected, but LOVED for who he was.\n\nHilary 14th October 2021\n\nAs a Civil Servant in the Home Office it may seem a bit strange to some people just how upsetting it was when the announcement came that 'JB' was ill and how devastating it was to hear of his passing but I think that is a sign of just how well respected and liked he was. Whenever there was a hint of a reshuffle many of us would say how we would love the new Home Secretary to be JB and I'm so saddened that I will never serve under his leadership like when he was Immigration Minister. On a more personal level my eldest son was in the same class as Cathy and James' youngest daughter so it was always lovely to see them both at school events at times when I knew just how busy he was because of an issue that was bubbling in the department. This is something that stayed with me because it showed if a Government Minister was able to leave the office for sports day or art display then so could I and is a message I make sure to share with my staff. To all of James' family and loved ones, my heart aches for the you as I can not imagine the pain you are going through. Please take comfort in the knowledge of how much James has touched the lives of so many and you have the love and best wishes of an army of people. RIP James Brokenshire - a thoroughly decent human being!\n\nNatalie 14th October 2021\n\nThere is a profound sense of loss among so many of us following the death of our friend James Brokenshire. He was an excellent Member of Parliament characterised by his courtesy, intelligence and loyalty. He will be a sad loss to his constituents who have become used to his tireless efforts on their behalf in Parliament and elsewhere. I will always remember the night we spent in Washington drinking Scotch late into the night and being mercilessly bitten by mosquitoes as we sorted out the country's political problems! He was relentlessly optimistic about his illness and I know that of all those who will miss him, it will be the family that he so obviously loved so much. All of us were enriched by knowing James and can count ourselves lucky for having had him as a friend. We send his family all our love and prayers.\n\nLiam 13th October 2021\n\nI shadowed James as Northern Ireland Secretary for a year or so and got to know him a little and respect him greatly. He was an excellent, understated but highly effective minister, who took his responsibilities to the peace and people of NI with great care and seriousness. He was unfailingly caring, courteous and charming and, rare among politicians, was both liked and respected across all political divides. He could and would have achieved much more had he been given more time. My deepest condolences to all of his family and friends. RIP James. Owen Smith\n\nOwen 13th October 2021\n\nGareth and I separately met James when we campaigned for him in Hornchurch. We still describe locations with reference to the flat! Over the course of housewarmings, stag dos and weddings, we had the pleasure of getting to know both James and Cathy better. Not forgetting the time one of the children got both of us addicted to Plants vs Zombies on the iPhone! We will miss seeing James and the big smile on his face as he was always so pleased to see you.\n\nAli 12th October 2021\n\nJames Brokenshire was my friend and I shall miss him. I have hesitated to post anything as it is difficult to know quite how to capture on Facebook the essence of a man like James. Many others have managed to do so and one of the benefits of waiting has been the opportunity to read of the genuine grief and sense of loss from friends, colleagues of all political hues and those whose life he touched through his Parliamentary work. I cannot begin to imagine how truly ghastly this time must be for Cathy and their children but I do hope they can take comfort from this outpouring of love for James. He was a thoroughly decent man, a quality some may say is rare in politics, which is one of the reasons so many people have written of their sadness at his passing. Un-showy, diligent, effective and hard-working were all true of James; government and politics need more people like him. He leaves a legacy of achievement, the greatest of which is his family. James we loved you and will miss you.\n\nRobert 11th October 2021\n\nI had the privilege to welcome James Brokenshire to the Home Office when he became a Minister in 2010. He was warmly regarded by all the civil servants who worked with him as hard-working, incisive and tenacious. Above all he was thoroughly kind and decent, making time for people regardless of rank or status. Two specific memories spring to mind. When James visited the immigration offices in Glasgow we happened to bump into one of the office cleaners. Where other Ministers might have swept by, James took the trouble to stop and introduce himself and to thank her for everything she did. As you can imagine this made a huge impression on her and in fact it was the only time I saw her lost for words! On another occasion I was in the Home Office HQ with a civil servant colleague who was visiting the main office for the first time. Again we bumped into Minister Brokenshire who took the trouble to stop and chat. That colleague texted me on Friday when news of his death became public to say that she would never forget his kindness in taking the time to chat to her 'even though he must have had a million and one other things to do'. These are just a couple of small examples of how James made a positive impact on others - to add to the numerous examples and tributes I have read elsewhere. My sincere condolences to James' family and friends. Gillian\n\nGillian 11th October 2021\n\nI have known James for many years through his closest childhood friend. It was one of those friendships where meet ups are by parties and milestones in your mutual friends lives. So I continued to see he and Cathy and then the children through all of our lives. He was one of those people who was constant, never changing, always friendly and engaging. We talked about losses we'd experienced over the years but I never thought I'd be talking about his loss so prematurely. He like me was a lawyer and one memory I do have of him is when I was at Bar school, so about 27 years ago, I was really struggling with an assignment and I called him, knowing he would be the right person to ask, so thoughtful and analytical. He was at work, but was generous enough to help and advise me. He always seemed to make time for everyone. Dear Cathy, he is an inspiration, as are you with all you have dealt with during his illness. ❤ much love Nyree xx\n\nNyree 10th October 2021\n\nOver the years, I had met James and Cathy at many Receptions and Party functions. But, it was after James's diagnosis of lung cancer, that I came to actually know him. He reached out to the lung cancer community, offering his help. He spent many hours with me and colleagues, giving valuable advice, guidance and support -for which we are truly grateful. He wanted to ensure the future was better, for those diagnosed with this devastating disease. This Tribute and the awareness it is raising, is ensuring that continues. He was passionate, in particular, about earlier diagnosis. The campaign continues. And, when a Lung Cancer Screening Program is eventually approved here, in the UK, I will certainly raise a glass to you, James! Reading the Tributes left in these Pages, he has touched so many lives, across so many communities. He faced this illness with such courage. His love of family, kindness and compassion for others was always evident. His passing is so horribly unfair. I send my heartfelt thoughts and prayers to Cathy and the family. Jesme.\n\nJesme 10th October 2021\n\nSuch lovely memories of times spent with James over the years. Delivering leaflets for his campaign in Hornchurch, celebrating his well deserved successes with his beloved Cathy and his family as it grew. Attending Fundraising dinners, which were enhanced for me when he was the guest speaker as he was so informative and entertaining. Watching the marathon in Limehouse with breakfast butties and a glass of champagne whilst handing out sweeties to the runners. Informal Christmas Eve lunches with Simon & I and a handful of friends before James and the family attended various carol services. Then all meeting up again for the midnight service at St Andrews. These and so many more memories of a very unique and special person who I was very fortunate to call a friend. James, I really can’t believe that you have been taken so young. I send my condolences and prayers to Cathy and the children at this very sad time.\n\nHelen 10th October 2021\n\nAs a civil servant, I worked closely with JB last year particularly around COVID. He was always so kind in dealings with the most senior or the most junior colleagues, always listened and clearly cared deeply about the work he was doing. Even recently, I was in contact with him, and he remembered what I had moved onto, and asked after me and my family, despite all that he was dealing with. He will be missed by so many people.\n\nJohn 10th October 2021\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting James once when he came to visit the Coca Cola factory in Sidcup. We had a short conversation on the importance of providing facilities for local people. It struck me how much he knew about his local constituency, how much he cared and also how much he was prepared to do. I was left feeling positive about meeting a politician with ability and integrity. I felt his constituents were in capable hands. He was humble yet had great presence. A very memorable experience for me and such a tragic loss for many.\n\nNicholas 10th October 2021\n\nAs a trainee at Gouldens (now Jones Day) I was lucky enough that James took me on as an informal mentee. His work ethic and attention to detail for his clients was second to none but he also took the time out of those long hours to really train me for which I was very grateful. I recall being invited to his house for Christmas drinks. I was a little apprehensive, not quite sure what to expect going to the house of a City law partner. In the end it was a lovely, low key relaxed event with just a handful of colleagues and family and friends. James and Cathy couldn’t have made me feel more welcome. We always knew his passion lay with politics (for all the good reasons) and his family and it’s been great to watch his career progress. So very sorry to hear the sad news, my thoughts are with his family, Madi\n\nMadi 10th October 2021\n\nI will never forget when we met at a night with MICHAEL GOVE MP at sidcup rugby club, you was so exited that you that day had the all clear of this terrible disease some 3 years ago. I was shocked to hear it had come back with a vengeance. Me and my wife thought so much of that night and to speak and shake hands with you. Our thoughts are with your family to lose such a nice husband and dad. Sleep well my friend and god bless you. DELL AND DOT ACOURT. XXX.\n\nderek 10th October 2021\n\nI did not know James Brokenshire very well at all, we were not friends on a personal level. But I have two abiding memories. 1. In 2018 I was the Bexley Local Government Agent which included his Old Bexley & Sidcup constituency. One of the first major campaign days was a week or so after he had left hospital. Clearly exhausted after major surgery and in pain, he turned up to thank people for coming and to apologise that he was not yet well enough to join in. 2. After his relapse I posted good wishes on Twitter along with 100s of others. Two days later I received a personal email thanking me for my kind words. But this wasn't a cut and paste reply, he recalled a joke from the first time we met and asked about the wellbeing of a mutual friend. In a world of sharp elbows and big egos, these randon acts of kindness are too rare and should be cherished. My thoughts are with Cathy and their children. May he rest in peace +\n\nAndrew 9th October 2021\n\nI was with James at Exeter University where we both read Law and then entered Parliament with him as well. Throughout he was kind, diligent, fair minded, humble and servant hearted. He displayed those qualities at URE - University Radio Exeter when for example he interrogated the political activism of me, Robert Halfon, Sajid Javid and Tim Montgomerie. Also as an MP and Minister - I was most engaged with James in his time as Immigration Minister holding him to account in relation to policies such as immigration detention and refugees. Whilst there was much to provoke him, James handled the challenges with great patience, care and consideration whilst holding and defending the Government’s position robustly with great clarity and firmness of purpose. James has many ministerial achievements but I recall how he played a major part in supporting a fair and compassionate policy towards refugees and reforming immigration detention. Areas of policy which may not receive much attention or praise but which needed the compassion and attention to detail which James always displayed. James was a good supporter and faithful friend of the Conservative Christian Fellowship (CCF). Indeed faithfulness and friendship are the two words which for me sum up James personally and publicly, which is why he was much valued, and will be much missed and forever cherished. Be assured of my and CCF’s prayers for James’ family.\n\nDavid 9th October 2021\n\nPolitician, friend and family man. Or more precisely, family man, friend and politician. To all he will be reminded for being fair, considered and insightful. To those who were fortunate enough to have him as a dear friend will also remember James for his generosity. He would always be more interested in you that he was himself. Despite all his achievements, of which there were many his conversation always focussed on the person he was speaking to. When he asked you how you were, you knew he meant it with sincerity. He gave warmth to all those around him. We were fortunate to know James for 15 years. During that time, he became an MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, serving his constituents and country with diligence and respectfulness. No problem was too small. No problem was too big. His service in the Home Office saw him make difficult decisions. He was brave enough and clever enough to rid our country of those who threatened us. During the 2012 Olympics he spent every waking hour in a darkened room with the Security Services making sure we all stayed safe. As Secretary of State for Northern Ireland he engendered a sense of humanity across the divide, receiving warmth and compassion from both sides. It reminds one of the Sting song ‘The Russians Love Their Children Too’. Such feats show the true achievements of a great man from high politics to a gentle conversation between friends. He always made a difference. He leaves behind a legacy to be proud of. The biggest of which is his family. Because of James and his amazing marriage to Cathy his children possess care, intelligence and humour, in equal measures. James thank you for being a dear friend and thank you for making our world a better place. Adrian, Michelle, Annabel and Pips\n\nMichelle 9th October 2021\n\nHe was my minister when he first joined the Home Office and I worked with him off and on over his years there. He was a joy to work for, thoughtful, considered, funny, intelligent and always willing to listen to, and appreciate, advice. More than any other minister, he always had time to say hello and have a quick chat, even when he moved to the other end of 2MS to be SoS DCLG. I have so many memories of dealing with him, but what stands out in all of them is his profound decency. One evening, as I was working late to meet a deadline his office had set (and thus missing several leaving drinks), he walked past my desk, asked why I was there so late, and on hearing why, told me to forget the deadline and go to the drinks - on the grounds that saying cheerio to my friends was more important than his deadline. It was a small, but important, gesture to me. He always said he saw ministers and civil servants as working together as a team and I for one was glad to be on his team. JB has been taken far too young and I feel such sadness for his family, but they should know that he was liked, admired and valued by so many that worked for him.\n\nLinda 9th October 2021\n\nMy name is Fr Gary Donegan a Passionist Priest based in Holy Cross Parish Ardoyne Belfast. Ardoyne Parish lost the largest number of victims during The Troubles and while James was SOS was directly involved with Peace initiatives including contentious parading. I had the pleasure of meeting him on a number of occasions including Stormont House and had a wonderful dinner one evening in Hillsborough Castle. That evening there was just about half a dozen of us and I got to see the James RIP his family and friends loved a lovely, kind and humble man. Thoughts and prayers on the loss of such a young man for his family I for one am a better person from knowing him May he Rest in Peace 🙏\n\nGary 9th October 2021\n\nI've known James all my adult life, since we were both in our late teens - he was my oldest friend. With busy lives, we've often gone for months without our paths crossing, but they always did, and whenever we got a chance to catch-up, it was like no time had passed. In many ways we grew up together, and he's been a constant in my life. We have lots of very happy, amazing and fun filled memories, which Dhiren & I will treasure. As these pages show, he was a rather special individual (though we all know he would have laughed and never accepted that for a moment) and we were all very lucky to have him in our lives. But this will make our loss even harder. We're so devastated for Cathy and the children, and are sending all our love and support to you all, now and forward into the future. I'm just so sad he won't be physically present in any of our lives any longer, but will always be here with us one way or another. Dhiren & Graeme xx\n\nGraeme 9th October 2021\n\nI was so sorry to learn of James’ death. I was one of the partners who recruited James to Gouldens as a trainee solicitor; subsequently we worked together in the “world of waste” , which was quite esoteric at the time. Indeed although I have been retired for 7 years now, I received this afternoon an email from a client ( Nigel Sandy) for whom James and I used to do a lot of work together. I extract part of Nigel’s email: “ Dear Clare I was very sorry to read that James has died. I know he had been ill but I guess we thought being a youngish guy he would pull through. I liked James who I worked with on quite a few deals when I was Hanson. We are just about to leave for Turkey so I was going to ask that if you are in touch with his family pass on my condolences as well. Love Nigel” James achieved so much in politics and was so principled and straightforward ( unlike some of his fellow MPs) . We former fellow Gouldens (then Jones Day) partners followed his political career with great interest. I am sure he would have been devastated to have to give it up in order to keep battling against this b……dy disease. As a fellow cancer patient he and I exchanged emails over the years since he was diagnosed and I hope I was able to give him some support. Anyway I just wanted to drop you a brief message of sympathy and condolences at this difficult time. You and your family are in my thoughts and prayers. With every sympathy Clare Clare Deanesly\n\nClare 9th October 2021\n\nI was so sad to hear the news that James Brokenshire has passed away at such a peak time in his and his family's life. I had the pleasure of meeting James on a couple of occasions and although he had already been ill, I was impressed by his professionalism, courtesy, warmth and friendliness - he was a very approachable young man who I am sure would have gone far in the crazy World of politics. Although I am a former resident of Sidcup and currently live in Bromley, I send my sincere and heartfelt condolences to his wife, Catherine and his family. Be assured dear lady you and your family are in the thoughts and hearts of many people, even though you may not have met them. God Bless you James - Heaven now has another Star! Sandra (H)\n\nSANDRA 9th October 2021\n\nJames proved that nice guys can succeed in politics. Generous with his time and always positive, he got on by being helpful and kind to others. He was universally liked and respected because of this. He held some of the toughest ministerial positions in government and yet always remained cool, calm and collected. Yet throughout this he remained at heart a family man. He clearly adored his wife and children and was deeply committed to them. Time spent in his company was always effortless. I regarded him as my closest friend in politics, yet I realise that there are plenty of others who would say the same of him. Taken from us far too soon he will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him. James Cleverly\n\nJames 9th October 2021\n\nIt is rare to weep at the loss of a politician. Three stand out - John Smith, then Labour Leader, May 1994, Robin Cook, in Aug 1995 and Donald Dewar in October 2000. What made them stand out? For the most part, their integrity and their respect for the ordinary people. Thus it was that I was both saddened and shocked at the passing of The Rt Hon James Brokenshire at the age of 53. I never met him or any of the others, but his integrity shone like a beacon. The tributes from all sectors of politics attest to this fact. In a world where integrity has taken a Sabbatical, Mr Brokenshire shone like a beacon. Thank you for not taking the ordinary man and woman in the street for fools. I hope those currently serving on all sides will look on and learn. Sincere condolences to the Brokenshire family. His memory and his legacy will live on. To Mrs Brokenshire, may God grant you serenity, strength and peace. Praying for you all. Every blessing. Angella\n\nVee 9th October 2021\n\nAs a Trust and school community, Odyssey, Townley Grammar and King Henry school would like to express our deep sorrow at the passing of James Brokenshire MP. As an MP, a parent at the school and a friend, James was the epitome of intelligence, good grace and kindness. We have been blessed by his presence and his absence will leave a hollow which was once filled with the very best of humanity. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time. May they find comfort in the legacy left by this remarkable soul. Desmond Deehan\n\nDesmond 9th October 2021"
