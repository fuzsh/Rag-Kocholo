        "text": "LONDON — So many flowers have been arriving at 10 Downing Street that the official residence of the British prime minister must, inside, resemble a funeral parlor. Well-wishers have been sending bouquets to Theresa May to congratulate her on being appointed successor to David Cameron.\n\nOne Interflora delivery man, having handed a pretty bunch of pink roses to the Number 10 doorman, took a selfie of himself in front of the celebrated black door. He then did a theatrical bow to the watching press corps.\n\nDespite all this color — the heady scent of success — the mood at Downing Street is less frivolous. The Cameron years (he was in charge from 2010-2016) were broadly a time of optimism and zest. He may have spent much of his premiership battling with gloomy subjects such as deficit reduction, welfare shrinkage and Islamist terrorism but “Sunshine Dave” was incorrigibly upbeat. Like the crucifixion victims at the end of Monty Python’s Life of Brian, he took the view “always look on the bright side of life.”\n\nMay is a different proposition. Please don’t call her dreary; nor would “glum” be quite the word. But Britain’s new head of government is a tough old bird, a chewy customer, dry biscuit — or, to use an expression popular at present with Westminster commentators, “a grown-up.”\n\nThis is true in at least the factual sense. At 59, May is the oldest person to have landed the top job in British politics since 64-year-old James Callaghan took power in 1976. Tony Blair and Cameron were both 43 when they made it into No 10, testosterone still bursting out of their jeans, swank in their swagger.\n\nWhat does age do to a politician, or to any of us? It perhaps teaches us not to be so idealistic or impressed by fashion. There may be some old fools in the world, but the years usually tame one’s naivety. Photographs of Blair and Cameron at the start of their party-leadership periods show wet-faced Berties, certain they could change the world. Blair thought he could tame Rupert Murdoch. Cameron went off to the Artic Circle to “hug a husky.” May just quietly announced that she would not be announcing policy on Twitter.\n\n* * *\n\nShe bears the more dog-eyed, hunched-shoulder aspect of someone who knows that life will soon kick us in the shins. We should not expect the May years to be a time of vivid declarations of intent. Blair, within days of settling himself in No 10, said his government would pursue an “ethical foreign policy” (six years later he took his country to war in Iraq). Cameron spoke of creating a “Big Society,” a concept airier than a decent sponge cake. It will be something of a relief to the British people if May spares us any of the prophet’s vision baloney and simply ensures the sewers remain unblocked and the buses run on time.\n\nPhilip Hammond is a creature of almost heroic dullness. You will find oxidized Etruscan coins with greater sparkle.\n\nYoungsters, like Prince Hal with Falstaff and company, often like to surround themselves with cronies. May is more of a loner. For her party chairman she appointed a gruff former coal miner, Patrick McLoughlin. Cameron had given that job to his university chum and tennis partner Andrew Feldman.\n\nOut went most of Cameron’s Etonians. May carried out an unexpectedly brutal reshuffle of the Conservative front bench. There was no place for George Osborne, the former chancellor. May coldly calculated that he had been rejected by the electorate in the Brexit referendum. There was no room for sentimentality to the colleague with whom she had worked quite closely for six years. Death to George!\n\nOn the domestic front, Downing Street will no longer resound to playful squeals. The Camerons had a young family but the Mays are childless. May’s Woody Allen-lookalike husband Philip is not as photogenic as clothes-horse Samantha Cameron. One enduring image of boho-chic Mrs. Cameron, taken after the May 2015 general election win, was of her whizzing along Downing Street on a toy scooter. Philip May, standing near his wife while she made a speech after her appointment, was a portrait of brick-like stoicism.\n\n* * *\n\nMay’s ministerial appointments — with one remarkable exception — have been monochrome, favoring experience and age over novelty, pragmatism over image. The new chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, is a creature of almost heroic dullness. You will find oxidized Etruscan coins with greater sparkle. But there may lie his very strength. The financial markets crave stability and “Spreadsheet Phil” could be just the man to provide it.\n\nThe minister in charge of Brexit, David Davis, is 67 and was last in government in the mid 1990s. During the EU referendum he was a campaigner for Leave, but his speeches were so restrained, they felt less like political events and more like an accountant’s quarterly report to the board. May could have opted for some thruster, some trendy representative of 21st century Cool Britannia, but she chose Davis with his broken nose, his heavily sugared tea and his pie charts.\n\nA cabinet of responsible, dull adults. And a jester.\n\nMay also dispensed with the brilliant (but demonstrably untrustworthy) Michael Gove and instead promoted to the cabinet such low-wattage figures as Damian Green and James Brokenshire (you will not have heard of them and it will probably stay that way). Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, whose exotic love life had been plastered all over the tabloid newspapers, was replaced by Karen Bradley, a provincial tax specialist of impeccable stolidity.\n\nIs there a danger in this drabness? Western politics at present has a problem connecting to the public. The soap opera of politics can generate interest — and thus a sense of democratic involvement — in the electorate. All of which goes to explain what, to some observers, has been the most baffling of May’s decisions: to make Boris Johnson her foreign secretary.\n\nBonking Boris, the man who compared Hillary Clinton to a sadistic mental-asylum nurse, the man with the untidiest hairdo in Christendom, the man who got stuck on the zip wire! How can he possibly occupy so great a position in the counsels of “grown-up” Theresa? Simple. He is there to cheer everyone up. He is there to provide the comic relief. Every great drama needs its jester. That will be Boris’s role and he will perform it brilliantly.\n\nQuentin Letts writes for the Daily Mail."
