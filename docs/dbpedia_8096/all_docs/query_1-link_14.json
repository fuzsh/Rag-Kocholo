        "text": "Tory minister James Brokenshire has died aged 53 after a long battle with lung cancer, his family revealed on Friday.\n\nThe father-of-three resigned as security minister in July after telling Prime Minister Boris Johnson that his recovery from lung cancer surgery in February was taking “longer than expected”.\n\nThe former Northern Ireland Secretary and Home Office minister was diagnosed with the disease in 2018.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Brokenshire’s family said: “James died peacefully at Darent Valley Hospital yesterday evening with family members by his bedside. He had been in hospital since Sunday after his condition rapidly deteriorated.\n\n“James was not only a brilliant government minister, but a dedicated constituency MP.\n\n“But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many.\n\n“We would like to thank all the NHS staff, particularly those at Guy’s & St Thomas’ in London, who cared for James with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years.”\n\nMr Johnson led tributes to Mr Brokenshire, who served as MP for Hornchurch in east London from 2005 to 2010 and then MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup from the 2010 election onwards.\n\nThe Prime Minister said he was “desperately sad” to hear of the Mr Brokenshire’s death.\n\n“James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective,” he said.\n\n“He served with particular distinction in the Home Office and as Security Minister. If the government needed something done well and speedily - and sensibly explained - James was the man to do it.\n\n“I worked with him for many years in London and I know how much he cared for the interests of his Bexley constituents.\n\n“His fight against cancer was heroic, and it is a measure of his resolve that he came back from a first bout with the disease to serve in government again. He will be missed by all who knew him. Our thoughts are with Cathy and his family.”\n\nHis tragic death united people from all political divides as colleagues and opponents in Parliament paid tribute to his “dignity and bravery” in the face of his cancer diagnosis.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said: “James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held. He fought his illness with dignity and bravery.\n\n“I’m incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak tweeted: “James Brokenshire was a man of public service and the highest integrity. He was a valued friend and colleague and will be deeply missed. My thoughts are with his family on this incredibly sad day.”\n\nFormer PM David Cameron, said: “Devastated to hear the heartbreaking news that James Brokenshire has died, well before his time.\n\n“He was a hard working and dedicated MP but, more than that, he was a thoroughly decent and lovely man, and devoted to his family. My thoughts and prayers are with them all today.”\n\nFellow London MPs also provided tributes.\n\nDagenham and Rainham MP Jon Cruddas said: “ He was a thoroughly decent man. My thoughts are with his family and friends today.”\n\nIlford North MP Wes Streeting, who faced his own battle with cancer earlier this year, added: “My heart goes out to James Brokenshire’s family and friends.\n\n“It feels desperately unfair that someone who has given so much, and had so much more to give, has been taken too soon. I’ll never forget the characteristic kindness that he showed me earlier this year.”\n\nMr Brokenshire was first diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018 after he coughed up a spot of blood during an event at Hillsborough Castle as Northern Ireland Secretary.\n\nAfter initially stepping down before getting the all clear, the former lawyer was appointed by Boris Johnson to the Home Office in February 2020.\n\nMr Brokenshire had his right lung removed as part of his treatment in February this year and had said stepping down from his Home Office ministerial role would allow him to focus on his health.\n\nRead More\n\nTributes across Northern Ireland’s political spectrum for ex-secretary of state\n\nBoris Johnson leads tributes after death of former minister James Brokenshire"
