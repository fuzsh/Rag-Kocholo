        "text": "David Cameron has gone back on a vow to fund more CCTV.\n\nThe Prime Minister promised to make more money available to communities wanting to install the surveillance equipment.\n\nHe made the commitment after CCTV pictures proved invaluable to the police in chasing and prosecution those involved in last summer’s riots across Britain.\n\nQuestioned in the Commons in the days after disturbances, the Prime Minister was asked by Labour MP Gloria De Piero what he would do to help more areas wanting to install CCTV.\n\nHe replied: “By making funds available. One of the first things I did in politics as a Home Office special adviser was to set up one of the first ever CCTV challenge funds so that communities could invest it.”\n\nBut the Home Office has now admitted there will be NO additional money to pay for more cameras.\n\nHome Office minister James Brokenshire has written to Ms De Piero saying the “priority” is to cut the deficit.\n\nHe added: “Against this background we have not been able to prioritise capital expenditure for community safety purposes. We would, therefore, look to local authorities and the police to fund CCTV from local resources alongside their other priorities.”\n\nMs De Piero, a shadow Home Affairs spokeswoman, said the Prime Minister had broken his promise to help communities needing protection.\n\n“In the emergency debate on the summer riots, the Prime Minister told the House of Commons that CCTV was so valuable that funds would be made available.\n\n“It now transpires that this is not the case after all. Instead the message from this Government to communities on crime prevention is that you are on your own,” she said.\n\n1 NHS waiting times\n\nIN June last year Mr Cameron said there would be no rise in hospital waiting times. “We will not lose control of waiting times – we will ensure they are kept low,” he said.\n\nLatest figures show the number of patients waiting longer than the 18-week guarantee rose by 34% in July.\n\nThe PM also pledged there would 3,000 extra midwives. Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show the Government has cut the number of training places for nurses and midwives and the Royal College of Nursing says the shortage of midwives is putting lives at risk.\n\n2 CHASE FARM HOSPITAL\n\nBEFORE the General Election Cameron pledged to save the maternity and A&E units at the North London hospital. “What I would say to Gordon\n\nBrown is if you call an election on November 1 we’ll stop the closure of services at this hospital on November 2,” he said in 2007.\n\nThis week Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced Chase Farm’s A&E and maternity units would be downgraded.\n\n3 FRONTLINE CUTS\n\nTHREE days before the general election, Cameron told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “Any Cabinet minister who comes to me and says ‘Here are my plans’ and they involve frontline reductions, they’ll be sent straight back to their department to go away and think again”.\n\nSince the election his Government has made £81billion of frontline cuts.\n\n4 VAT\n\nALSO during the general election campaign Mr Cameron said there were no plans to raise VAT. “What we can say is we’ve set out our plans and our plans involve cutting wasteful spending and stopping the National Insurance rise. Our plans don’t involve an increase in VAT,” he said on 1 April 2010.\n\n5 FLOOD DEFENCES\n\nQUESTIONED by Labour MP Ben Bradshaw in November 2010 the PM said spending on flood defences had been “protected.”\n\nA check by Channel 4 News found: “Whichever way you look at this one, it seems Mr Cameron was wrong to say spending on flood defences was protected.”\n\nIt found there had been an 11% cut to the budget for flood defences compared to the last four years."
