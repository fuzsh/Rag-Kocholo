        "text": "Cancer: Karol Sikora outlines 'most persistent symptoms'\n\nThe 53-year-old MP for Old Bexley & Sidcup wrote to the Prime Minister this morning to say his recovery was \"taking longer than anticipated\". It is the second time cancer has forced him to step back from public duties.\n\nMr Brokenshire was first elected to parliament in 2005 and under David Cameron's leadership was seen as an up and coming minister, serving as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Crime Reduction, immigration minister and security minister.\n\nWhen Theresa May became Prime Minister in July 2016 he was promoted to the Cabinet, serving as the Northern Ireland Secretary.\n\nHowever, just 18 months later he was forced to stand down due to the need to undergo an operation to treat his lung cancer.\n\nHe returned to the Cabinet as Housing Secretary a year later in April 2018 after making a successful recovery.\n\nREAD MORE: UK warns EU Britain will stop 'misapplication' of Brexit deal\n\nWhen Mr Johnson took office he was moved over to the security brief he had previously held in the coalition Government.\n\nHe submitted his resignation letter this morning saying that a recurrence of cancer meant he was unable to fully fulfil his duties.\n\n\"My recovery from treatment and return to full duties is taking longer than anticipated,\" he said in his resignation letter to the Prime Minister.\n\n\"Given my responsibilities to the public, the Government and to Parliament, I have therefore concluded that it is best that I stand down from my Ministerial role and focus on restoring my health.\n\n\"It has been an honour to serve as a Minister in your Government and to have had the chance to work again alongside our police, security and intelligence agencies whose tireless efforts keep us all safe.\"\n\nHe paid tribute to the support of Priti Patel during his recovery from the illness and said he wanted to once again return to front-line politics if his condition allowed.\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nUK urged to ditch EU rules as Brussels seeks to ‘asphyxiate London’ [REACTION]\n\nMPs erupt as SNP's Blackford calls Boris Johnson 'tinpot dictator' [VIDEO]\n\nMichel Barnier admits 'we are worried' - Warning issued [UPDATE]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She has been a pleasure to work with and her personal kindness and encouragement during this recent period has meant a great deal.\n\n\"Thank you for providing this opportunity to serve the public. I hope to be able to serve again in some way in the future.\"\n\nMr Johnson said he was \"very sorry\" to have received the resignation letter as he offered the MP his \"best wishes for a speedy return to full health\".\n\nHe wrote: \"I fully support your decision to focus on your recovery.\n\n\"You should be immensely proud of what you have achieved in this Government - not just in the Home Office, but also in the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Northern Ireland Office.\n\n\"In all your roles you have shown tireless dedication to improving the lives of others, particularly addressing some of the most challenging issues that face us as a country.\n\n\"I understand entirely your need to step down from your role but look forward to welcoming you back as soon as possible.\"\n\nMr Brokenshire's replacement has not yet been announced."
