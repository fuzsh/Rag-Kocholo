        "text": "British Prime Minister Theresa May filled out her Cabinet posts Thursday, assembling a government that sweeps away many of her predecessor’s supporters and places strongly anti-EU figures in key international roles.\n\nCCTV America’s Richard Bestic reports.\n\nAfter filling half a dozen of the top jobs Wednesday — including surprise choice Boris Johnson as foreign Secretary — May made a host of new appointments Thursday.\n\nSome of Cameron’s Cabinet kept their jobs — including Defense Secretary Michael Fallon — but most ministries were shuffled, with new ministers including Justice Secretary Liz Truss and Education Secretary Justine Greening.\n\nThe list of major players in Britain’s new Conservative government:\n\nPrime Minister — Theresa May\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer (Treasury) — Philip Hammond\n\nForeign Secretary — Boris Johnson\n\nSecretary of State for Exiting the European Union — David Davis\n\nHome Secretary — Amber Rudd\n\nJustice Secretary and Lord Chancellor — Liz Truss\n\nDefense — Michael Fallon\n\nInternational Trade — Liam Fox\n\nEducation — Justine Greening\n\nHealth — Jeremy Hunt\n\nTransport — Chris Grayling\n\nWork and Pensions — Damian Green\n\nBusiness, Energy, and Industrial Strategy — Greg Clark\n\nEnvironment, Food, and Rural Affairs — Andrea Leadsom\n\nCommunities and Local Government — Sajid Javid\n\nInternational Development — Priti Patel\n\nCulture, Media and Sport — Karen Bradley\n\nNorthern Ireland — James Brokenshire\n\nGovernment Chief Whip — Gavin Williamson\n\nConservative Party Chairman — Patrick McLoughlin\n\nLeader of the House of Lords — Natalie Evans\n\nAndrea Leadsom, a Conservative leadership contender who quit the race after she appeared to suggest that being a mother gave her an advantage over May, was given the environment department.\n\nMay also cleared out rivals, firing stalwarts of David Cameron’s outgoing government including Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and — most significantly — Justice Secretary Michael Gove, her onetime competitor for the job of Conservative leader.\n\nGove led the “leave” side in Britain’s EU referendum battle alongside former London Mayor Boris Johnson, then betrayed him by making a bid for Conservative leadership — a job Johnson had long sought.\n\nMay won the leadership battle and quickly sacked Gove, who is now seen as treacherous by many Conservatives. She rewarded Johnson with the plum job of foreign secretary.\n\nHe is a surprising choice to be Britain’s top diplomat. The former mayor of London is internationally famous — but for rumpled eccentricity and distinctly undiplomatic gaffes, rather than statesmanlike behavior.\n\nIn April, Johnson suggested that U.S. President Barack Obama had an “ancestral dislike” of Britain because he is part-Kenyan.\n\nJohnson said he was “very excited” to be part of the government. Asked whom he would apologize to first, he said “the United States of America will be at the front of the queue.”\n\nNew Treasury chief Philip Hammond reassured a startled world that Johnson — whose responsibilities include oversight of the MI6 spy agency — would be a team player\n\n“The Cabinet works collectively and we have got a range of different characters and a range of different styles and a range of different talent,” he told BBC radio. “The lead and the tone will be set by the prime minister.”\n\nLesser-known than Johnson but at least as important to Britain’s future is David Davis, the cumbersomely titled Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Davis, a veteran lawmaker who has twice run for the Conservative leadership, is one of the staunchest Euroskeptics in British politics.\n\nHe is also a formidable battler, as May knows. For years the libertarian Davis has sparred with May over the powers of Britain’s spy agencies. He is currently suing the British government in the European courts against surveillance laws May introduced as home secretary.\n\nDavis has previously said that Britain should take a “brisk but measured” approach to exit talks with the EU. He has said that Article 50 of the EU constitution — the formal trigger for two years of negotiations — should be invoked by the start of 2017.\n\nOther EU leaders are already pressuring Britain to open formal talks — and warning that the U.K. cannot have access to the single European market without accepting free movement of EU citizens, a sticking point for many pro-Brexit Britons.\n\nThe foreign policy spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party in Parliament said Thursday that many British suggestions on the country’s future relationship with the European Union are “unworkable.”\n\nJuergen Hardt said that “free access to the common market means, among other things, accepting other fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of movement.”\n\nNew British Treasury chief Hammond tried to sound a reassuring note Thursday, pledging that he would not introduce an emergency national budget — even though there are question marks hanging over the economy following the country’s decision to leave the EU.\n\nHammond offered calming tones to the markets and the public in a series of interviews the morning after taking office.\n\n“The number one challenge is to stabilize the economy, send signals of confidence about the future, the plans we have for the future, to the markets, to businesses, to international investors,” Hammond told Sky News. “Britain is open for business. We are not turning our back on the world.”\n\nThe comments came before the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted not to cut interest rates in a bid to stimulate the economy.\n\nIn a surprise move, it kept the bank’s benchmark interest rate at the current record low of 0.5 percent, where it has stood since in March 2009. It also decided against pumping more money into the economy with a new bout of quantitative easing.\n\nBut the committee hinted it would loosen policy in August, when it will have fresh forecasts about the state of the British economy.\n\nHammond acknowledged that investment in Britain had been shaken since the referendum result.\n\n“There has been a chilling effect,” he told the BBC. “We have seen an effect in markets, we have seen business investment decisions being paused because businesses now want to take stock, want to understand how we will take forward our renegotiation with the EU, what our aspirations are for the future trading relationship between Britain and the European Union.”"
