        "text": "**James Brokenshire died after a battle with cancer on 8 October 2021. Full story.**\n\nJames Brokenshire was elected as the Conservative Party MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in 2010, being reelected in 2019 with a majority of 18,952. He was the MP for Hornchurch between 2005 and 2010 before his then seat was impacted by boundary changes.\n\nThe Old Bexley and Sidcup constituency is contained in the south eastern corner of London along the A2 and A20 down to the border with Kent. Containing a number of owner occupiers, many of the local population commute daily into central London. This is a safe Conservative seat which was previously represented in Parliament between 1950 and 2001, by the former Conservative Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath.\n\nBrokenshire served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government between 2018 and 2019, and as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 2016 and 2018. He was Security Minister as Minister of State at the Home Office between 2020 and 2021 and 2011 and 2016.\n\nBrokenshire was politically close to the former Conservative Prime Minister, Theresa May, having previously worked under her at the Home Office.\n\nBorn in 1968 in Southend-on-Sea, Brokenshire grew up in Basildon and then Loughton. He studied a law degree at Exeter University.\n\nBefore entering Parliament James Brokenshire was a partner at the law firm Jones Day Gouldens. He is married to Catherine and the couple have three children.\n\nBrokenshire had successfully battled lung cancer in 2017. In 2021, he stood down from his Ministerial position after further lung surgery. He died in October 2021.\n\nEmail: james.brokenshire.mp@parliament.uk\n\nPersonal Website: http://www.jamesbrokenshire.com/\n\nTwitter: @JBrokenshire\n\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/jpbrokenshire?fref=ts"
