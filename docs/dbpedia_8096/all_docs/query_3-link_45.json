I am proud to have known him and to have worked with him.\n\n“James was a strong advocate of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and was a dedicated Northern Ireland Secretary from July 2016 to Jan 2018 when he resigned for health reasons.\n\n“In all my dealings with him, I found him courteous and a politician with a strong sense of duty and integrity. He was a person of character, someone who could be trusted.\n\n“I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Cathrine and his children, his wider family and his many friends and colleagues in the Conservative Party.”"
