        "text": "Trying to act normal in the kitchen is a battle politicians are never going to win, reckons Times columnist Matt Chorley.\n\nHe suggests UK's MPs trying and failing to appear normal would \"get less grief being photographed in a sex dungeon\".\n\nOne of their favourite pastimes is sharing pictures of themselves in their kitchen in an attempt to show people they're normal folk, but it never seems to work.\n\nThe latest victim is housing secretary James Brokenshire, who has become embroiled in a strange argument after being criticised for having four ovens, despite insisting he's only got two.\n\nIt's the great mystery of our time - does Brokenshire have two ovens or four?\n\nThe Claim\n\nPeople weren't pleased that the MP appeared to have four ovens in his kitchen, with Brokenshire drawing criticism from members of the public who lacked either the space or the money to afford four ovens.\n\nBrokenshire's claims that he only had two ovens were met with derision. Four doors, four clocks, four separate sets of controls. To most people that's clearly four separate ovens , and the politician's insistence otherwise has further angered those who think four is much too much.\n\nThe MP for Bexley and Sidcup joins the ranks of his fellow politicians taken to task over pictures in the kitchen, a proud political tradition that includes former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher, Gordon Brown and David Cameron.\n\nThe Counter Claim\n\nDespite the abuse over his multitude of ovens the MP is insistent he only has two, saying they were double decker ovens. Surely he'd know better than anyone?\n\nThe ovens on top do appear to have more controls than the ones on the bottom, so perhaps Brokenshire is right and they really are just two with split sections rather than four individual units.\n\nThe MP posted a picture of himself and a Victoria Sponge in front of his indeterminable number of ovens with the caption \"Amazing what you can rustle up! Maybe some more hot potatoes next! #twoovens\".\n\nSupport for Brokenshire has come from a strange place - television presenter Adrian Chiles, who said bringing cameras into the kitchen made it \"very easy for people to find stuff in there to hate you for\".\n\nThe Facts\n\nAs if this story wasn't weird enough, the picture the politician shared trying to laugh off the situation is actually one he posted back in 2015.\n\nEven worse than that, and perhaps bordering on treason in the UK, eagle eyed observers noticed the clocks on the separate ovens showed different times. How can we trust this man to be part of our government if the clocks on his ovens are a minute apart?\n\nAt this point it's a matter of philosophy whether a double decker oven counts as one or two appliances. Even if it's technically all one appliance, does an extra section with separate controls count as a separate oven?\n\nWe may never know the answer, only the certainty that Brokenshire won't be the last politician to be pilloried for being pictured in his kitchen unsuccessfully trying to look normal."
