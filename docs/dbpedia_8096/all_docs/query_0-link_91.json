        "text": "A fundraising page set up in memory of former Tory MP James Brokenshire has raised thousands of pounds for a leading lung cancer charity.\n\nThe family of the 53-year-old, who died on Thursday after a battle with lung cancer, established the fundraising page yesterday to encourage people to share their memories of the former Cabinet minister and donate in his memory.\n\nIn a statement this morning, Mr Brokenshire’s family said that more than £12,000 had been pledged by the public to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in the first 24 hours of the site’s launch.\n\nBy lunchtime on Saturday, donations had risen to more than £14,000.\n\n“Great people leave a huge and lasting legacy. James Brokenshire MP wanted to make a permanent difference to other people’s battles against lung cancer,” they said, adding that people should donate to the “excellent work of the Roy Castle Lung Foundation in lieu of flowers”.\n\nMr Brokenshire’s death on Thursday sparked an outpouring of gratitude towards the Conservative MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, who served as both Northern Ireland Secretary and Housing and Communities Secretary in former prime minister Theresa May’s Cabinet.\n\nBoris Johnson led tributes to the MP on Thursday, describing him as the “nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians”.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak described Mr Brokenshire as “a man of public service and the highest integrity”.\n\nHe said: “He was a valued friend and colleague and will be deeply missed. My thoughts are with his family on this incredibly sad day.”\n\nFormer prime minister David Cameron, who first appointed Mr Brokenshire to a Home Office role, said: “Devastated to hear the heartbreaking news that James Brokenshire has died, well before his time.\n\n“He was a hard working and dedicated MP but, more than that, he was a thoroughly decent and lovely man, and devoted to his family. My thoughts and prayers are with them all.”\n\nMr Brokenshire was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018 and underwent surgery to remove the upper lobe of his right lung. At the time, he said first saw his GP after coughing up a small amount of blood, which raised particular alarm as a non-smoker.\n\nThe father-of-three became vocal in urging the Government to roll out a national screening for lung cancer, and in April 2018 used a debate in Parliament to call for a national programme to improve poor survival rates.\n\nMr Brokenshire’s family said he died peacefully in hospital on Thursday, with his loved ones at his bedside. He had been admitted on Sunday after his condition “rapidly deteriorated”."
