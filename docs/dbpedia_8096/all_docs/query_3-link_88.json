        "text": "THE widow of former Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire is backing a charity campaign to raise awareness about lung cancer symptoms.\n\nA FORMER special adviser from Co Armagh who was James Brokenshire's ministerial aide has spoken of his devastation at losing the \"best boss I will ever have\".\n\nFormer Secretary of State James Brokenshire has died aged 53, three years after a lung cancer diagnosis.\n\nFORMER secretary of state James Brokenshire has confirmed his lung cancer has \"progressed\" and he is starting a new line of treatment.\n\nFORMER Northern Ireland Secretary of State James Brokenshire has resigned as a minister due to a \"longer than anticipated\" cancer recovery.\n\nA CONSERVATIVE peer has conceded that he may have referred to the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) as the \"Sinn FÃ©in Appeasement Department\" when working as a senior adviser to secretaries of state in Belfast.\n\nTHE sacking of Julian Smith means his successor Brandon Lewis will become the sixth secretary of state in just 10 years.\n\nThe scale of homeless deaths in Britain has been branded a \"national tragedy\" after official estimates showed a rise of almost a quarter over five years.\n\nFormer Secretary of State James Brokenshire believes his resignation from the position through illness earlier this year contributed to political instability in the north."
