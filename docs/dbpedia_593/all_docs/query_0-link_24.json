        "text": "Scrapbooks, Snapshots and Memorabilia : Hidden Archives of Performance asks the questions : What constitutes an archive ? What is worthy of being archived ? And who decides ? Performances are ephemeral, so archival questions of selection and appraisal determine which performances will be remembered by history and which will not. The essays in this collection each explore a different facet of the ephemerality of performance, and the traces it leaves behind : from photographic stills of actors or sets ; draft scripts and production notes, theatre programs and reviews ; the language used to evoke the experience of watching a dance ; to the memories contained within a site which has been used for a site-specific performance. Each of the contributors to Scrapbooks, Snapshots and Memorabilia employs pertinent case studies to reveal performances that are so often ‘hidden’ from the authoritative archival view ; for example, those by women, indigenous people, amateurs and working people, and those outside metropolitan centres. In this way, they build a powerful argument for reconsidering – or at the very least, broadening – notions of what the performance archive can be."
