These studies have questioned the national paradigm and sketched an image of Europe as a complex interwoven intellectual space.1 Beyond the European context, the nature of intellectual transnationalism has been explored in pioneering inquiries of the planetary reach of, for instance, literature or the culture industry.2 These studies relate to the vast field of historical and social scientific scholarship that has emerged out of the sharp increase in border-crossing perspectives, cultural hybridity, and the circulation of people, ideas, and institutions. Intended as a contribution to this growing literature, our volume asks whether intellectual historians, preoccupied with entanglement and hybridity, run the risk of painting an excessively harmonious picture of Europe as a cultural and intellectual space, reproducing the all too familiar image of a borderless space of texts and ideas where everyone is able to participate on equal grounds. Whereas studies on the geographies of knowledge production have convincingly shown that place, space, and their asymmetrical interrelations deserve careful consideration when assessing the socio-cultural ­conditions of intellectual life and the circulation of ideas,3 questions of spatiotemporal ­hierarchy have not been a major concern in the field of intellectual 1 E.g., Christophe Charle, Jürgen Schriewer, and Peter Wagner, Transnational Intellectual Networks.

In general, ­European intellectual history or the history of intellectuals in Europe has focused primarily on relations and entanglements between the dominant nineteenth-century empires and nation-states such as France, Great Britain, ­Germany, or Russia.4 Less attention has been paid to the inevitable asymmetries of power that exist between big and small, center and periphery, core and margin, satellite and province—to name only some of the most frequently used terminologies for analyzing political, economic, or cultural hierarchies.5 This book is devoted to an examination of precisely such intra-­European asymmetries. The aim is to reconsider the nature of European ­intellectual space and introduce into the debate analyses of the position and strategies of intellectuals, writers, artists, and scholars from non-dominant regions within Europe. If Europe in this period, roughly between the midnineteenth and the late ­twentieth centuries, was a global center of intellectual life and cultural production, what, then, was the role of its own internal peripheries?\n\nIntra-European and Colonial Relations\n\nThe intra-European hierarchies studied in this book were conditioned by largescale political developments such as the rise of competing forms of nationalism, colonial expansionism, social movements contesting the supremacy of the national state, the collapse of empires, the totalizing claims of the state between the world wars, and the rise of the bipolar Cold War constellation where Eastern Central Europe was suddenly provincialized, while Western Europe gradually lost its self-evident cultural centrality to the United States. Such macro-level developments had an important bearing on intellectual hierarchies, but it was never a one-to-one relationship. Sometimes the centers of European intellectual life overlapped geographically with military, political, or economic domination, and sometimes they did not. Moreover, insofar as the book is concerned with the extent to which space and location condition the strategies, outlook and self-understanding of individual and collective actors, we should recognize the specific role played by intellectuals in composing and contesting spatial constructions in the first place, including the notion 4 Christophe Charle, Les intellectuels en Europe au XIXe siècle. Essai d’histoire comparée (Paris: Seuil, 1996). 5 In European intellectual history, the “archetypal” asymmetry has been the one between Western and Eastern Europe; see Larry Wolff, Inventing Eastern Europe. The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment (Stanford, ca: Stanford University Press, 1994).\n\nAt the Periphery of European Intellectual Space\n\n3\n\nof national territory. Having achieved some degree of hegemony, such spatial formations tend to take on a life of their own and determine the interaction between intellectuals and ideas, or the way historical actors position themselves in a larger whole. Rather than systematically assessing the relationship between empirical reality and conceptual representations, the aim of this book is to explore the experience of being outside a dominant core and the strategies for acting that result from this experience. Perceptions of hierarchy shaped the behavior of intellectuals in the geo-cultural peripheries or “semi-peripheries,” and gave rise to a whole spectrum of strategies for dealing with asymmetry, as demonstrated by the individual chapters in this volume. These strategies ranged from struggling for attention, translating modernity, imitating the centers, and stressing the need to catch up on the one hand, and contesting or rejecting intellectual exports from the center and celebrating peripheral “authenticity” on the other hand. Sometimes the relation between geography, politics, and culture was articulated by mobilizing symbolic resources to compensate for geopolitical disadvantage. Typically, this has taken the form of marketing national cultural achievements and emphasizing culture over physical reality.6 The aptness of the terms “center” and “periphery” in describing intellectual relations has often been debated and criticized. Today, the conception of the periphery as a passive recipient of ideas developed in the core, or a provider of “raw materials” for the center, has been largely refuted.7 At the same time, the notions of “center” and “periphery” continue to raise strong emotions for and against. Some of the most important difficulties concern the units of analysis used for spatially defining a “center”—nation, city, region, specific institutions, etc.—and the “centralizing” and “peripheralizing” logics across social fields such as politics, the economy, science and higher education, and art and literature. Continuing this line of inquiry, as it pertains to the relations between intellectual spaces and their conceptualizations by writers, artists, and intellectuals, the contributions in the book suggest that speaking of centers in ­European intellectual space can refer to something spatial or temporal, and 6 On the local level, culture has similarly been mobilized by national minorities to offset a political disadvantage, as in the case of Finland-Swedes in Helsinki or German speakers in Prague at the turn of the twentieth century. 7 Peter Burke, History and Social Theory (Second Edition. Ithaca, ny: Cornell University Press, 2005), 82–87. See also Bruno Latour’s discussion of scientific “centers of calculation” as a complex accumulation between places and networks of human and non-human resources, in Bruno Latour, Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987).\n\n4\n\nNygård, Strang and Jalava\n\nmost often a mixture of both. “Europe” is no less ambiguous a term.8 In this volume, it relates both to the region, with its constantly negotiated borders, cores, and margins, and to the idea of Europe as the cradle of the Enlightenment and the beacon of modernity, with its claims to define the direction of universal progress and accompanying civilizing missions. Drawing attention to multiple forms of structural and symbolic inequality, postcolonial studies has significantly contributed to disengaging us from a static center–periphery or “diffusionist” model of cultural interaction. Postcolonial studies has also been an important factor in a more general “spatial turn,” highlighting place as being constantly produced and reproduced in interaction with its surroundings. In other words, places are not essences but processes, rooted in social practices, disciplinary power, and ideology.9 But to what extent is it reasonable to apply theories addressing the inequalities of colonial or racial domination on intra-European conditions? One problem is the extent to which postcolonial studies targets Eurocentrism as a part of Western supremacy in the world. In their search for alternative de-centered visions, ­accounts inspired by dependency theory, postcolonialism, or subaltern studies have sometimes tended to flatten “Europe” into a single, monolithic entity, leaving out the asymmetrical relations and hegemonic struggles within Europe itself. To paraphrase Dipesh Chakrabarty, it is certainly true that scholars who study Europe are usually free to ignore or compartmentalize the experiences of Asians and Africans, but equally compartmentalized are the experiences of actors from peripheral, marginalized, or “backward” European regions.10 While postcolonial readings of intra-European asymmetries have inspired us to analyze forms of dependency and domination, it is a matter of debate how far we can carry the analogy. On the one hand, insofar as we are dealing with spatial asymmetries, one of the hypotheses of the book is, indeed, that the logic of combined and uneven development, in the language of world-­systems theory, is more easily observable from the periphery, much in the same way 8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nOn the loose connection between center and spatial location, see Edward Shils, C ­ enter and Periphery. Essays in Macrosociology (Chicago & London: University of Chicago Press, 1975). For a recent account of Europe in the world, see Bo Stråth and Peter Wagner, ­European Modernity. A Global Approach (London and New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2017). Theoretically, the spatial turn is also indebted to such critical human geographers as ­David Harvey, Doreen Massey, and Edward Soja; see, e.g., Phil Hubbard and Rob Kitchin, eds., Key Thinkers on Space and Place (Second Edition. Thousand Oaks, ca: Sage, 2011). See the discussion in Frederick Cooper, Colonialism in Question. Theory, Knowledge, History (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005), 20–32.\n\nAt the Periphery of European Intellectual Space\n\n5\n\nas the dominance of Europe is most aptly seen from the outside.11 There are entanglements and structural similarities in terms of imperial dependency between the non-European colonies and the fringes of former European empires. To be sure, colonial history is an integrated part of the history of ­Europe that cannot be separated from the “internal” developments within the region. Moreover, colonial expansionism and colonial discourse impacted on how populations especially in frontier regions within Europe were perceived and treated, as pointed out by Roísín Healy and Enrico Dal Lago. Evidence of “discursive colonization”—using colonial categories in framing relationships ­between self and other, often to justify the need to civilize the disadvantaged—can certainly be found within Europe itself. Sometimes these dichotomies, borrowed from a colonial setting and merged with the widespread scholarly and political racism of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, led to the subjugation of native populations by the colonizers. In other cases, the hierarchies were more discursive.12 Violent or discursive, they were expressions of world-ordering within a dominant paradigm of progress and modernity. If the asymmetrical relations that such world-ordering produces are more tangible at the margins, this follows not necessarily from subjugation but from the fact that “latecomers” or culturally “underdeveloped” regions in the ­nineteenth and twentieth centuries had to make great efforts to insert themselves into an interconnected global system of nation-states. In doing so, peripheral intellectuals were faced with the power of universalizing discourse emanating from the centers, which they adapted, rejected, or transformed according to local demands. A specific problem for intellectual and cultural historians relates to the complexity of the multidirectional universe in which scientific, literary, and artistic practices are carried out, sometimes described as networks that connect a variety of urban and institutional nodes. The hierarchical dimensions of this universe translate into basic differences between, for example, those who can afford to universalize “local” experience and those who cannot.13 On the other hand, insofar as applying postcolonial discourse on intra-­ European developments means speaking of the European margins in the same breath as of former colonies, there is a risk of denigrating the suffering and 11 12\n\n13\n\nSee also the quote from Derek Walcott in Mikołajewski’s contribution in this volume, which exemplifies this point.

See Stefan Nygård and Johan Strang, “Conceptual Universalisation and the Role of the Peripheries,” Contributions to the History of Concepts 12, no. 1 (summer 2017): 57–77.\n\n6\n\nNygård, Strang and Jalava\n\nthe typically categorical outside position of the latter. After all, the European peripheries were in the period studied in this book predominantly considered “European” in the eyes of the centers, not as the “absolute Others of Europe.” As such, they belonged to the group of “enlightened” and “civilized” cultures whose intellectuals, in principle, were entitled to participate in the discussion, although sometimes as “distant relatives,” as the Polish exiled poet and essayist Czesław Miłosz suggests from his Polish-Lithuanian perspective: while they may have been acknowledged as Europeans, the peripheries were certainly not considered core “members of the family (quarrelsome but respectable).”14 Our volume thus contributes to previous research on Europe as seen from its geographical margins, including important works by Larry Wolff and Iver B. Neumann on Eastern Europe and Russia, Maria Todorova on the Balkans, Roberto Dainotto on Southern Europe, and Peter Davidson on “the North.”15 Rather than focusing on a specific cardinal direction, however, we try to bring together experiences from a selection of “non-dominant” regions in Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern Europe. The different Europes discussed here can be broadly divided into the central–imperial, the peripheral small states, and the “semi-central” former empires or intermediate countries such as Spain and Sweden. While some chapters look at Europe as an intellectual space from its margins, others provide views from multicultural and multilingual contexts. Yet another group of articles assesses the role of asymmetry within ­intellectual networks or between intellectual fields. “Asymmetry” is in this context understood as an umbrella term for the mix of temporal and spatial hierarchies, for which historical actors (as well as analysts) have used a cluster of ­conceptual pairs such as center–periphery, core–margin, modern–backward, East–West, North–South, dominant–dominated, metropolis–­ satellite, or developed/ developing–underdeveloped.\n\nScales and Borders\n\nOne way of dismantling the dichotomy of intra-European versus colonial hierarchies is to look beyond the framework of nation-states, which, d­ espite 14 Cited in Wolff, Inventing Eastern Europe, 373. 15 Wolff, Inventing Eastern Europe; Maria Todorova, Imagining the Balkans (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009); Iver B.

Moving beyond and across the boundaries of ­nation-states forces us to reconsider the question: where is the periphery? What kind of borders separate cores and margins? Should we follow the borders that separate nation-states and linguistic or cultural regions? Or should we break up these large-scale, ideological constructions into a more nuanced picture, take into account the existence of peripheries in the centers, centers in the peripheries, and perhaps shift attention from nationalized states to cities and urban centers, or even more specifically, to universities, publishing houses, or galleries, which after all constitute the main locus of intellectual life?16 And yet, as the historian Angelika Epple points out, the criticism of a narrowly ­national and/or state-centric framework does not necessarily mean that the historical significance of nation-states and the differences in local opportunity structures and cultures can be denied. Instead, the issue at stake is that there are multiple relations between different ­localities and actors, and the national scale is one of many possible spatial dimensions—no doubt an indispensable one when studying Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In the period with which our volume is concerned, national(ized) discourses ­implied constraints that must neither be overlooked nor exaggerated. Hence, our ­objective is not to undermine nation-states; rather, we emphasize the ­degree to which such entities are never fixed, but fluid, relational, and historically changing.17 Regardless of which spatial scale we choose as our point of departure, however, we should acknowledge that centers and peripheries constitute each other in a mutually enforcing interaction, as this volume demonstrates with respect to non-dominant regions within Europe. There is also a striking similarity in terms of how such mechanisms work on different scales. The same kind of peripheral opposition to the provincial universalism of the self-­sufficient core clearly characterizes twentieth-century relations between the Western and the non-Western world as well as the relations between ­dominant and\n\n16\n\n17\n\nStefan Nygård and Blaise Wilfert-Portal, “Introduction,” in The Geopolitics of Intellectual Space, eds.

Conversely, the u ­ niformity of the center is often exaggerated when seen from the periphery, be it “Europe” in postcolonial studies, “France” or “Germany” from the viewpoint of nondominant European countries, or urban centers from a rural or small-town perspective. Different answers to the question of scale impact on how we describe trans-local relations within an inter-urban, inter-national, or cosmopolitan framework, which needs to be adjusted according to our different objects of study. The contributions in this volume focusing on European “peripheries” thus bring into the discussion a broad variety of scales and spatial dynamics. In most cases, the social field in which intellectual debates are situated transgresses national boundaries. Tensions between overlapping scales are mobilized in multiple ways by individual actors who draw on international ­references in order to strengthen the national, as in the nineteenth-century idea of a cosmopolitanism of nations, or conversely mobilize internationality in order to undermine locally dominant positions. While remaining largely within the framework of European nation-states and urban centers, and paying close attention to their interconnections, the contributions in this volume seek to highlight the ways in which intellectuals, writers, and artists manouver in the universe of national and imperial states competing with each other over political, economic, and cultural “progress.” The book is both about elucidating how asymmetries are produced and about exploring how they determine the actions of individual and collective actors in the light of the different hierarchies. By reconsidering the premises for studying asymmetrical relations in European intellectual history, it aims at forging a perspective that avoids the tendency sometimes present in transnational intellectual history to overemphasize reciprocity and equality. The aim is also to coin a perspective which avoids the opposite tendency of fighting the injustice of a one-dimensional hierarchy sometimes associated with postcolonial discourse. Discussing examples from Northern, Eastern, and Southern Europe, the chapters analyze the ways in which historical actors in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe conceptualized intellectual space and how they dealt with its hierarchical aspects. By paying particular attention to the weaker part in asymmetrical relations, they highlight the extent to which perceptions of hierarchies defined the agendas of historical actors, how asymmetries were used, even instrumentalized, for strategic purposes at “home” and “abroad,” how intellectuals managed tensions between local and transnational space, and how these spaces in themselves were produced and reproduced in continuous interaction with each other.\n\nAt the Periphery of European Intellectual Space\n\n9\n\nThe Structure of the Book\n\nThe book is divided into three parts. The first part, Reconsidering European Intellectual Space, concerns the strategies of peripheral intellectuals around 1900. At that time, Western Europe with metropoles such as Paris, Vienna, Berlin, and London was widely acknowledged as the center of both European and global intellectual space. Although the period between the latter part of the nineteenth century and the First World War has been perceived as leading to the zenith of both global and intra-European interlinkages and structures,18 it was also a time when European intellectuals could still harbor a belief in European superiority.19 By and large, the production of national territory in the long nineteenth century—in part as a counterforce to turn-of-the-century globalization—resulted in the emergence of the nation-state in Europe as the dominant strategy for social organization, including intellectual life, although the idea of a borderless republic of letters also continued to be part of the self-understanding of intellectuals. As a result, for instance, literary, artistic, and academic markets only partly overlapped with national territories and borders. The chapters by Narve Fulsås & Tore Rem and Stefan Nygård & Johan Strang examine how these tensions and ambivalences impacted on the transnational strategies of Nordic small-country intellectuals with a strong selfproclaimed peripheral identity, whereas David Cottington’s chapter examines the consolidation of a pan-European avant-garde network which contributed greatly to the decentering of Paris as the fulcrum of modernism. The field of avant-garde studies has shifted from a rigid image of international modernism with one undisputed center to a focus on decentered or at least multi-centered networks and to an understanding of notably cubism as “a language with many dialects.” Other field-specific asymmetries are examined by Tommaso Giordani in his chapter on the interaction of German, Italian, and French Marxism, highlighting the interplay between two different intellectual fields: a Marxist European one dominated by Germany, and the national ones in France and Italy. Moreover, the chapter underlines variations in how the relation between 18 19\n\nSee, e.g., Sebastian Conrad, Globalisation and the Nation in Imperial Germany, trans.

For the simultaneous development of a global conscience and the new quality of European superiority, see, e.g., Matthias Middell and Katja Naumann, “The Writing of World History in Europe from the Middle of the Nineteenth Century to the Present: Conceptual Renewal and Challenge to National Histories,” in Transnational Challenges to National History Writing, eds. Matthias Middell and Lluís Roura (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), 84–89.\n\n10\n\nNygård, Strang and Jalava\n\nthe national and the transnational was conceptualized by actors from different contexts—in this case Italy, France, and Germany—as well as the obvious limits of center–periphery modelization for a field such as international Marxism. The second part of the book, Negotiating the Center, explores European intellectuals coping with dramatically transformed geo-cultural settings that were evident particularly after the First World War. The war brought along the collapse of the Romanov, Hohenzollern, Habsburg, and Ottoman Empires, ushering in an era of disorientation, lack of horizon, and identity crisis in ­Eastern and Central Europe, but it also led to new forms of international activities and concerns. The hierarchies examined by Diana Mishkova involve comprehensive perceptions and uses of asymmetry in the context of regional and civilizational discourse or national identity politics, the politics of belonging and demarcation with respect to imagined centers and significant others. In her contribution, Emilia Palonen evokes the fluid nature of Europe as a center. She discusses the transnational trajectories of the Budapest School of Marxist humanism, drawing attention to the complex spatiality of a network spread across the globe in the cold-war period, from Melbourne to Moscow, at the same time as many of the key actors remained firmly anchored in European debates. The transformations of the twentieth century had significant implications for the developing world order, with the United States becoming the major challenger to the previously dominant Great Britain, France, and ­Germany, as discussed from a Spanish point of view in the chapter by José María Rosales. The defeat of Spain in the war with the usa in 1898, along with the loss of its colonial territories, was experienced by Spanish intellectuals as a negative decentering process, whereas the Nordic scholars, studied in the chapter by Marja Jalava & Johanna Rainio-Niemi, seized upon the opportunities that were opened up by America’s expanding cultural, academic, and economic influence on Europe. The latter chapter, in particular, emphasizes the flexibility of the peripheries in adjusting to such transformations, sometimes by playing centers against each other. One crucial aspect that sets the intellectual and academic fields of these countries apart is that while the question of dealing with geopolitical decline was a major concern for intellectuals such as Manuel Azaña and José Ortega y Gasset in Spain, as demonstrated by Rosales, Finnish and Norwegian intellectuals aspired to link their native cultural and scientific spaces to an emerging global academic center. With regard to old and new, progress and decline, these and other chapters reveal diverging combinations of spatial and temporal criteria for defining centrality, between accumulated cultural capital, position in global power-geometry, or promise for the future. The final part, Cold War Dynamics, discusses the reconfiguration of European intellectual space after the Second World War. This space was ­solidified by\n\nAt the Periphery of European Intellectual Space\n\n11\n\nan East–West division along the Iron Curtain, and yet, characterized by a constant blurring of the division and the ensuing fluctuation of center–­periphery conceptions. In his chapter, Manolis Patiniotis examines the geopolitical tensions between centers and peripheries arising from cold-war national and transnational interests. He does this by exploring the Greek attempts to outline the dividing line so that the country would stay within the “free world,” thus highlighting the role of the margins in the making of centers—Greece asserting its place as “the core of the center”—in twentieth-century transatlantic efforts to outline the borders of Western civilization. In Łukasz Mikołajewski’s chapter, the focus is on Polish exiled authors who, with varied strategies and success, wanted to address both broader Western European audiences and readers in communist Poland at the same time. Finally, Zsófia Lóránd’s chapter on Yugoslav feminism traces the asymmetries that emerged from the shifting ways in which Yugoslavia was seen in Europe before and after the break-up of the country in the early 1990s. The chapter not only highlights a meta-level asymmetry in terms of the still low number of women featured in intellectual history writing, but also raises the important issue of the non-simultaneity of political, economic, literary, and artistic geometries; when we, in the context of Yugoslav and Western feminism, pose the question of who was considered “advanced” and who needed “to catch up.” The answer, of course, depends on the point of emphasis. For Yugoslavian feminists, gender relations may have appeared more advanced at home, but at the same time they saw themselves as lagging behind their Western colleagues in terms of freedom of expression and level of theorization. Collectively, the book produces a multi-layered image of Europe by examining the relationships between intellectual spaces, fields, and markets of different size and status. The scale of analysis ranges from conceptualizing the place of nation-states and regions, in the chapter by Mishkova, to the field-specific asymmetries of Marxist theory or Yugoslav feminism examined by Giordani and Lóránd, respectively, and the global reach of the Budapest school of Hungarian intellectuals discussed by Palonen. Each contribution offers a different perspective on our general proposition to think “geometrically” about intellectual practices, by foregrounding asymmetries that operate on different levels and are to a varying degree acknowledged, contested, or challenged by the actors affected by them. While some of them dealt with geocultural asymmetry by mobilizing symbolic capital associated with a center in their own local setting, others sought to nuance the notion of advanced/ backward, act as if the center–periphery dichotomies were meaningless, make use of them for personal gain, or to counterbalance a disadvantageous position by playing competing centers against each other. The key issue is that\n\n12\n\nNygård, Strang and Jalava\n\nthe perception or self-perception of geo-cultural position has been and still is a crucial factor in shaping how the individual actors navigate between the ­local, the national, the regional, and the transnational. It influences their understanding of how “external” events impact on “internal” developments, and their general level of interest in keeping up with, or opposing, developments elsewhere.\n\nEurope through a Kaleidoscope\n\nTaken together, the chapters suggest that investigating Europe as an intellectual space is a kaleidoscopic exercise. Just as with each turn of the kaleidoscopic lens the pattern is significantly modified, European intellectual space naturally varies between points of observation. Moreover, it is constantly reproduced through negotiations that are more hierarchical and biased than they are reciprocal. The situatedness and the role of the local filter should always be considered when assessing conceptualizations of Europe as an intellectual space, whether they emanate from the core or the periphery. The book therefore stresses the need to look critically at the very logic of producing asymmetries, to recognize the importance of these dynamics for the self-understanding of individual actors with different horizons of expectations, to pay attention to individual actors’ strategies for dealing with geo-cultural constraints, and to consider the extent to which asymmetries foster or even force actors into reflectivity and resistance vis-à-vis universalizing tendencies. On the level of national space, the ideal-typical poles in the transnational process of negotiating cultural Europe are, on the one hand, small latecomer nations such as Finland in the Northern European context, where the actors are characterized by a predominantly peripheral self-understanding. Intellectuals belonging to this group were generally more inclined to instrumentalize “Europe” for specific local purposes than to try and participate in transnational discussions on equal grounds. Then we have the cultural centers, typically constituted by metropoles such as Paris, Berlin, and London in the nineteenth century, with a stronger tendency to universalize local debates, a tendency that was both contested and reinforced by the peripheries. And in between we find such countries as Sweden, Poland, Italy, Hungary, and Spain, where perceptions of geo-cultural position were fundamentally transformed or persistently ambivalent in the period discussed in this book. In addition to diverse understandings of supranational space, closely connected with notions of time, progress, and modernity, different regions and competing factions within them tended to operate with different “Europes”\n\nAt the Periphery of European Intellectual Space\n\n13\n\nto begin with. Indeed, the extent to which we can talk about a European ­intellectual space crucially depends on our acknowledging the intrinsic ambivalences of the concept, the porousness of “borders,” the “internal peripheries” of core regions that are obscured when the nation-state is the dominant unit of analysis, and the importance of relations to trans-European spaces. By focusing on conceptualizations other than those of the centers or of regions subjected to colonial domination in the twentieth century, the volume conveys not only the role of hierarchy but also the multi-directional transfers of ideas between “centers” and “peripheries,” the crucial role of mediators, and the complex mechanisms by which asymmetries are produced and reproduced through the behavior and choices made by historical actors in dealing with structural constraints. While the world-systems perspective of combined and uneven development—and the claim that progress in one part of the world is matched by underdevelopment elsewhere—is not irrelevant for understanding how transnational intellectual space works, the chapters included in this book clearly illustrate the difficulties involved in reducing the role of the peripheries to recipients or producers of “raw material” to be processed by the centers. Exploring different ways of studying intellectual asymmetries and investigating the power of perceptions of centrality and marginality are pertinent tasks for the study of modern European intellectual history today. While it has been a great merit of transnational history to recognize the integral part played by “foreign” references in the creation of national spaces, the passionate critique of methodological nationalism and the focus on hybridity has also served to obscure the hierarchical dimensions of, in our case, intra-European intellectual encounters. With its specific reference to intellectuals—writers, artists, historians, and social theorists—the book speaks to the long-standing debates on the tensions between, on the one hand, the idea of an egalitarian and supranational community of intellectuals, and, on the other hand, local rootedness, national, urban, or linguistic allegiances and discourses, and the symbolic power they continue to entail.20 20\n\nThe book is the result of collective reflections on the hierarchical aspects of European intellectual space, conducted in a series of workshops with historians working on different parts of Europe and organized in Florence, Helsinki, Berlin, and Rome between 2013 and 2016.

For Neiglick as well as Brandes, national romanticism in science, literature and art stood in the way of progress and transnational modernity. Arguing that the small nations of Europe could not allow themselves to be self-absorbed, both Neiglick and Brandes wanted to reverse the perspective by stressing the need to import international modernity in order to “catch up.” Cultural asymmetries and center–periphery dynamics played crucial roles in the lives and careers of small-country intellectuals in the international system of nineteenth- and twentieth-century nation-states. The cultural space of Neiglick’s Finland, and to a lesser extent Brandes’s Denmark, was characterized by a peripheral self-understanding vis-à-vis the centers of continental ­Europe. There was a strongly held assumption that the “real” discussions were taking place elsewhere, and that any ambitious scholar or writer needed to approach the cultural centers in order to develop professionally. But economic, social, and cultural obstacles restrained access to the core and the possibility of having a significant impact on debates carried on in the centers. More often, the purpose of approaching the centers was to gain cultural capital that could be used back home. Such terms as “Europe,” “Paris,” “Vienna,” or “London” thus became discursive markers by which the cosmopolitan avant-gardes fashioned themselves as local representatives of the core’s modernity. This core * This chapter is an abbreviated and slightly revised version of an article previously published in the Journal of the History of Ideas 77, no. 1 (January 2016). Work on the chapter was supported by funding from the Academy of Finland (258131). 1 Letter from Neiglick to the writer K.A. Tavaststjerna, cited by Gunnar Castrén in Nya Argus, February 16, 1938.\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���8 | doi 10.1163/9789004364530_003\n\n20\n\nNygård and Strang\n\nwas ­understood both spatially and temporally, not only as a place but also as an expression of advanced modernity. The examples discussed in this chapter are drawn from the experiences of intellectuals from Scandinavia, or the so-called Nordic countries, including Finland. This region provides important examples of the asymmetries in E ­ uropean intellectual space: “Norden” has always been on the geographical margins of Europe, but has never been completely dominated by solely one center. Both the predominant German cast of academia until the early t­ wentieth century and the strong Anglo-American influence post-1945 were a­ lways mitigated by German, Anglo-American, French, and Russian ­influences.2 Moreover, the Nordic region, which consists of five (or, prior to 1944, four) independent countries, is also interesting by virtue of its internal asymmetries, with the capitals of the old states of Denmark and Sweden competing for the role of regional center, and the young nations Finland and Norway (independent in 1917 and 1905, respectively) serving as peripheries of the periphery. We focus particularly on internationally oriented scholars often cultivating an uneasy relationship to nationalism in politics, culture, and science. International networks played a large role for nationalists and internationalists alike, but while the latter emphasized the need to strengthen the integrity and independence of the national culture, the former underlined the dependency of the peripheries on the cultural centers of Europe and positioned themselves accordingly as cosmopolitan cultural modernizers in their local contexts. Many of them belonged to a progressive movement of liberal or socialist intellectuals (kulturradikaler), and in Finland, where the intellectual field was split into Finnish- and Swedish-language factions, some prominent figures such as Neiglick provocatively adopted an internationalist position against the dominant Finnish nationalism, or defended the co-existence of parallel linguistic nationalisms. We will also draw upon examples from a second generation of positivist intellectuals who, after roughly the 1930s, were less involved in debates over nationality and more flexible in combining intellectual internationalism and patriotism. The Nordic intellectuals examined in this chapter conceptualized asymmetry in different ways.

Temporally, we focus on the late nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries, a period when nationality, internationality, and cosmopolitanism were intensively debated all over Europe. The general argument will, however, be familiar to anyone who has been engaged in the intellectual history of a small or peripheral culture, and will surely remain relevant even in the increasingly complex context of globalization. The chapter is divided into three parts. The first discusses cultural asymmetry and the limits of reciprocity, as well as the strategies developed by peripheral intellectuals to deal with this asymmetry. The second part calls attention to the multiple—local, national, and international—frames and strategies of small-country intellectuals, and particularly to the extent to which international trajectories are locally determined. The implications of multiple frames and positioning strategies are explored in the final section, where we consider the advantages and disadvantages of the peripheral position and the role of voices from the margins in international or global intellectual discussions.\n\nAsymmetrical Relations: Centers and Peripheries\n\nIn the nineteenth century and beyond, intellectual fields in Europe were clearly nationally determined, in so far as national institutions, audiences, and publication forums were decisive for anyone pursuing a career in the arts or sciences.3 But it is equally true that transnational references and comparisons constituted an inseparable part of each national space. Moreover, intellectual life revolved around a tension between the notion that all national cultures and languages were equal and the inevitable inequality resulting from disparities of prestige and power. Representatives of young nations such as Finland and Norway struggled for recognition abroad in a process where cultural import and export played a major role. As international acknowledgment of the national culture was often the ultimate aim, this exchange, as well as every other aspect of intellectual life, became part of the national project itself. While many intellectuals gladly acknowledged the national paradigm, finding it an honor to represent their nation at international congresses or world exhibitions, those who chafed under the strong national imperative dealt with 3 Gisèle Sapiro, ed., L’Espace intellectuel en Europe, XIXe–XXIe siècle: de la formation des Étatsnations à la mondialisation (Paris: La Découverte, 2009), especially the introduction by S­ apiro and the reprinted article by Bourdieu.\n\n22\n\nNygård and Strang\n\ninternationality differently. By forming alliances with intellectuals abroad, taking detours via foreign contexts, and adopting cosmopolitan positions in local debates, they challenged dominant positions within their native intellectual fields. In the 1880s the Swedish writer August Strindberg set out to conquer Paris in order to have his revenge on the cultural elites in Stockholm.4 Similarly, having been denied a position at the University of Copenhagen, Georg Brandes—one of Nietzsche’s “good Europeans”—spent a significant part of his life in Germany and traveling across Europe; he saw this as the most effective way to influence Danish cultural politics while remaining part of the contre-pouvoir.5 And Henrik Ibsen, the icon of Scandinavian modernism, spent a total of 27 years abroad, in Italy and Germany, mounting an aesthetic revolution from a distance.6 Ibsen, Strindberg, and Brandes—and, beyond the Scandinavian context, writers such as Kafka, Joyce, and Borges—are perhaps the best known, but there are numerous examples of how the interplay between the local and the transnational has been used as a means to achieve a more encompassing perspective on national questions. Such voluntary exiles also served to underline the detached position sought by those intellectuals who opposed the predominant ethical-political roles of nineteenth-century ­European intellectuals.7 The approaches that have emerged from recent attempts to overcome “methodological nationalism” in the humanities and social sciences have explicitly been developed as alternatives not only to narrowly national perspectives, but also to the comparative methodologies and earlier theories of cultural exchange between nation-states. According to a much-quoted article by Michael Werner and Bénédicte Zimmermann, the focus on comparisons or transfers risks merely reinforcing national differences, thus cementing “the principle of the Olympic Games,” according to which everyone must represent one, and only one, nation.8 Indeed, a key insight of transnational history and\n\n4 For a dissertation on this topic, see Stellan Ahlström, Strindbergs erövring av Paris: Strindberg och Frankrike 1884–1895 (Uppsala: Almqvist & Wiksell, 1956). 5 See Jørgen Knudsen, gb: en Georg Brandes-biografi (København: Gyldendal, 2008); “Georg Brandes e l’Europa” i–ii, Studi Nordici, vols. 9 and 10 (2004.). 6 See the chapter by Narve Fulsås and Tore Rem in this book. 7 For Finland, see Risto Alapuro, “De intellektuella, staten och nationen,” Historisk Tidskrift för Finland 72 (1987): 457–79. 8 Michael Werner and Bénédicte Zimmermann, “Beyond Comparison: Histoire croisée and the Challenge of Reflexivity,” History and Theory 45, no. 1 (2006): 33–35.

We borrow the Olympic Games simile from Henrik Stenius.\n\nFacing Asymmetry\n\n23\n\nthe study of cultural transfers is the emphasis on active selection and appropriation at the receiving end, which has resulted in examinations of the strategies of individual actors who are connected to each other in a complex web of relations cutting across national borders, and who make use of foreign ideas according to their own particular and often highly local concerns. At the same time, the long-standing image of an egalitarian and borderless intellectual republic tends to overshadow any consideration of particular and often highly local concerns. Pierre Bourdieu is certainly correct in pointing out that intellectual life is too often assumed to be somehow spontaneously international.9 The history of intellectual exchanges across and beyond Europe is a history of misunderstandings and reappropriations between very different transmitting and receiving contexts within a configuration of unevenly distributed symbolic capital. From the viewpoint of the periphery, the study of the social and cultural conditions of transnationality calls attention to the need to consider both entanglement and its limits. As long as we are concerned with the interaction between major European cultural and linguistic spheres, such as those in France, Germany, and England, it may well make sense to emphasize reciprocity, mutuality, and cross-fertilization. But as the asymmetry between the interacting parties increases, the degree of reciprocity decreases. This point may be rather obvious, but it needs to be emphasized in the light of the recent focus on hybridity in cultural history.10 In fact, in the majority of cultural transfers, the degree of reciprocity is probably very small.11 Such transfers, being locally determined, are essentially asymmetrical, and the appropriation or rejection of foreign imports is conditioned by specific local concerns.12 The labels “center” and “periphery” tend to provoke strong emotions of sympathy or antipathy. Center–periphery models are certainly problematic when they imply that the centers are active and the peripheries passive. The notion of an innovative center spreading modernity to the imitating peripheries is obviously a gross misconception. But while recognizing that innovation takes place in centers as well as peripheries, it may well be useful to recall other aspects of the center–periphery dichotomy in order to reflect upon the consequences of cultural hierarchies. “Periphery” should be understood as a 9 10 11 12\n\nE.g., Pierre Bourdieu, “Les conditions sociales de la circulation internationale des idées,” Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales 145 (2002): 3–8.

Studies in this direction have recently been attempted, for example, in accounts of “world literature” inspired by world-systems theory and undertaken by Franco Moretti and Pascale Casanova, as well as in postcolonial studies. Moretti has called attention to world literature in relation to the grossly uneven capitalist world system, a fundamentally unequal cultural space divided into centers, peripheries, and semi-peripheries, where the international circulation of ideas and literatures is anything but reciprocal.13 Subaltern and postcolonial studies, in turn, have emphasized the structural inequality between Western and non-Western societies, and have called simple diffusion models of cultural transfer into question by stressing the relevance of the periphery for the core, and by drawing attention to the problems involved in using Western concepts and theory to describe subaltern realities.14 Even if there is clearly a correlation between cultural, political, and economic asymmetry, it is important to recognize, with Gramsci and Bourdieu among others, the relative autonomy of the cultural field. Pascale Casanova refers to Fernand Braudel’s discussion of cultural versus economic centers in the early modern period, with Venice and Amsterdam at the core of commercial life, and Florence, Rome, and Madrid as the leading cultural capitals.15 Moreover, each field of culture, be it science, literature, art, or their subfields, has its own center–periphery relations. Competing philosophical schools may have their specific centers, such as Cambridge for the linguistically oriented analytical philosophers and Frankfurt for the critical theorists. Center–periphery should therefore be treated as a gradual and multilevel distinction, rather than as a rigid dichotomy. Also, a center often stands in a peripheral relation to another center. As a cultural region, the Nordic countries have had their own internal center–­ periphery dynamics, with Copenhagen serving as a regional center where European ideas were filtered and disseminated further to the more remote parts of the region. In 1936 logical positivism was introduced to a larger Nordic 13\n\nFranco Moretti, “Conjectures on World Literature,” New Left Review 1 (January–February 2000) and “More Conjectures,” New Left Review 20 (March–April 2003); Pascale Casanova, La république mondiale des lettres (1999; Paris: Seuil, 2008) and Casanova, ed., Des littératures combatives: L’internationale des nationalismes littéraires (Paris: Raisons d’agir, 2011). 14 Walter D.

This congress was a meeting point between the main international figures of the logical positivist movement and philosophers from all over the Nordic countries.16 Similarly, it was not a coincidence that the internationally renowned mediators of nineteenth-century Nordic philosophy and literature—Harald Høffding and Brandes—were both from Copenhagen. The city also attracted intellectuals from the other Nordic countries, for some of whom the cultural institutions and intellectual networks of Copenhagen functioned instrumentally as a stepping-stone on the way to the “real” centers of Europe. Minna Canth, the Finnish translator of the first volume of Georg Brandes’s scholarly bestseller Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature (Danish orig. 1872) humorously implied in a letter from the 1880s that while the translation was a means for her to advance her career, the plan was to move beyond Copenhagen: “When I reach higher, to Taine, Renan and Spencer, then I can say ‘so long’ to Brandes.”17 It is one of the main characteristics of center–periphery dichotomies that spatial, mental, and temporal dimensions tend to become entangled. Spatial terms such as “Europe,” “France,” “Vienna,” or “London” merge with temporal ones such as “world-leading,” “modern,” or “progressive,” thus exemplifying what Reinhart Koselleck has conceptualized in terms of “the contemporaneity of the noncontemporaneous.”18 This feature is particularly strong in the small nations, where intellectuals are predisposed to think that modernity exists elsewhere. The rhetoric of “following,” “catching up,” and “modernizing” can typically be found flourishing among the various avant-gardes of the peripheries, for whom fashioning oneself as a representative of advanced modernity in the cultural capitals of Europe was a common strategy. Neiglick conceived of this movement as travel in both time and space, and for him, the given standard towards which his native Finland was moving was French modernity. Within this configuration, Neiglick envisioned himself as an accelerator of progress, in accordance with a certain model of development that would enable the Finnish periphery to catch up with the center, or at least to stay ahead of other 16\n\n17 18\n\nSee Jan Faye, “Niels Bohr and the Vienna Circle” and Johan Strang, “Theoria and Logical Empiricism: On the Tensions between the National and the International in Philosophy,” in The Vienna Circle and the Nordic Countries: Networks and Transformations of Logical Empiricism, ed.

More often than not, the temporal center–periphery rhetoric was aimed at local rivals who were outmaneuvered as old-fashioned and outdated. As ­Neiglick before him, the Finnish logical-positivist philosopher Eino Kaila in the 1920s and 1930s effectively used his international networks to further his own position in Helsinki. According to Kaila, it was only through his connections to the Vienna Circle that Finnish philosophy could stay on a par with the latest achievements in European science.20 This conflation of temporal progress with spatial centrality was even more apparent when he was asked to referee professorial appointments in neighboring countries. Both in ­Sweden and in Norway, Kaila described philosophers interested in logical positivism as “ultra-­modern” and “more advanced” than their “backward” and “old-­ fashioned” rivals.21\n\nActing on Two Fields: The Local and the International\n\nThere is no escaping the fact that intellectual debates in self-consciously peripheral regions frequently mirrored debates in the core. They were often conducted by ambassadors of different “European” movements, with similar arguments and ideas, either with or without explicit references to leading intellectuals in France, Germany, or the Anglo-American world. Thus, the debate on philosophy and science between Durkheim and Bergson in France during the 1910s and 1920s was mirrored by a debate between the philosophers Rolf Lagerborg and Hans Ruin in Finland, where it was viewed through the prism of Finland’s German-oriented intellectual environment.22\n\n19 20\n\n21 22\n\nStefan Nygård, “Kulturradikal internationalism som nationell strategi,” Historiska och litteraturhistoriska studier 86 (2011): 61–90.

In such exchanges, those who are the first to introduce a new movement have a competitive ­advantage, which enables them to colonize the movement for themselves. A contender can then challenge an established “ambassador” by claiming to have a “more correct” interpretation, perhaps by referring to a more recent encounter with the intellectual authority in question. Against such a background, the intellectual histories of the peripheries have often been conceived of as a history of reception. The leading intellectual movements or philosophers in the European core have served as the given model of interpretation, while the context and intentions of peripheral actors have tended to be overlooked. However, the recent emphasis on reappropriation and cultural transfers in intellectual history has shifted attention beyond a static conception of dominant centers and receiving peripheries. As a result of an increasing interest in exploring the role of transfer agents and their ­intentions, deviations are more often described in terms of appropriations or “re-descriptions” of foreign ideas in a new environment.23 This activity takes place within the framework of an international circulation of ideas and cultural products, where the dynamics of each national or urban space at a specific point in time determine the degree of receptiveness or non-receptiveness to particular ideas. At the receiving end, the original context and the debates from which ideas emerge are left behind, making way for “misunderstandings” and variations in the interpretation of ideas in different contexts.24 There is always some element of “interest” involved on the part of the cultural importers, who may be looking for support for their position at home by seeking recognition abroad, or by forming alliances with foreign intellectuals. The main features of this process are clear: being associated with the cultural capitals of Europe or the specific centers of the different subfields of cultural and scientific life, or simply mobilizing internationally circulating ideas, constituted important aspects of local positioning strategies. At times, according to the culture researcher Itamar Even-Zohar, “the desire for change may promote a favorable attitude towards occurrences in another society, with the help of which, if transferred, one can hope to get away from an undesired situation.”25\n\n23\n\nOn the notion of “rhetorical re-descriptions,” see Quentin Skinner, Reason and Rhetoric in the Philosophy of Hobbes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 128–80. 24 Bourdieu, “Les conditions sociales de la circulation internationale des idées.” 25 Even-Zohar, Papers in Culture Research, 60.\n\n28\n\nNygård and Strang\n\nTaking a detour abroad thus provides a means to introduce change at home. Just as the notion of “catching up” entails the idea of a more advanced center as the source of diffusion of social and cultural innovations, individuals and groups have strived to become associated with a center. Internationally oriented avant-gardes, positioning themselves as the representatives of European modernity in the periphery, were in fact prone to accentuate the marginal ­position of their native countries and to contrast national heteronomy with international autonomy. In the introduction to Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature, Brandes describes the uneven spread of literary modernity in Europe, arguing that the Denmark of his time was “as usual” forty years behind “Europe.” Its literature, he writes, is like a small chapel in a large church; it has an altar but the main altar is elsewhere.26 It was important for scholarly and artistic avant-gardes, for whom being modern has meant being international and even vice versa, to look for support beyond the national context. To the extent that national recognition was associated with conservatism, the avant-gardes were inclined to present themselves as misunderstood at home and recognized abroad.27 However, even the most cosmopolitan and internationally successful among late ­nineteenth-century Scandinavian writers did not break completely from their native ­intellectual fields. More often than not, they remained oriented toward Scandinavian audiences and local problems, thus illustrating the local rootedness of their cosmopolitanism.28 Throughout his years spent in voluntary exile in Italy and Germany, Ibsen remained an essentially Norwegian writer taking part in a Scandinavian “modern breakthrough.” Strindberg was, as mentioned, taking part in a Swedish debate from Paris. And the position of the Finnish philosopher Rolf Lagerborg, whose dissertation was rejected on moral-political grounds at the University of Helsinki in 1900, was decisively strengthened at home when he received the mention très honorable for a French version of the same dissertation at the Sorbonne three years later.29 Acknowledging backwardness, being cosmopolitan at home, and seeking recognition abroad are examples of how asymmetry has been ­instrumentalized 26 27\n\n28 29\n\nGeorg Brandes, Hovedstrømninger i det 19de aarhundredes litteratur (Kjøbenhavn: Gyldendal, 1872), 10, 13. This is true also for the avant-gardes of the center. See Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, Nul n’est prophète en son pays? L’internationalisation de la peinture des avant-gardes parisiennes, 1855–1914 (Paris: Musée d’Orsay/Éd. Nicolas Chaudun, 2009). The point has been emphasized by Narve Fulsås, see “Ibsen, Europa og det moderne gjennombrotet.” One of the jury members was Émile Durkheim. See Marja Jalava, Minä ja maailmanhenki: Moderni subjekti kristillis-idealistisessa kansallisajattelussa ja Rolf Lagerborgin kulttuuriradikalismissa n. 1880–1914 (Helsinki: Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2005).\n\nFacing Asymmetry\n\n29\n\nby the contenders in non-dominant cultural fields. As modernity was perceived to be “elsewhere,” breaking with national narrow-mindedness was seen as a necessity among liberal progressives, cultural avant-gardes, and radical intellectuals, the latter stressing their position as “autonomous” intellectuals by taking part in national debates from a distance. Pilgrimages to European cultural capitals, voluntary exile abroad, and positioning oneself as a member of a transnational intellectual republic served the purpose of associating oneself with “advanced modernity” and acquiring a broader perspective on national questions. Typically, however, all of this was taking place within an essentially national or at least Nordic intellectual space that remained primary for the Nordic writers, artists, and scientists in, for example, turn of the twentiethcentury Berlin and Paris.30 There were substantial profits to be gained from recognition in the cultural capitals, but peripheral actors struggled to gain access to these centers. Language was the most obvious of the difficulties facing writers and intellectuals from minor language regions. Other obstacles were related to the difficulty of translating a position acquired in one intellectual field to another, the fluctuating values and expectations of national cultures, and the hierarchical relations between cultures. Intellectuals from the peripheries had to be creative in ­dealing with these obstacles. They could become devoted disciples of some internationally renowned figure or school of thought, or they could position themselves as sober and skeptical outsiders; they could try to become naturalized and learn how to behave as natives, aiming to participate in the core discussions on equal terms; or they could surrender to the prejudices of the centers, and take on the role of curious foreign specimens and caricatured representatives of their homeland. Sometimes, access to the core required ­adapting to commercial interests: for Ibsen this meant being forced to write an alternative “happy ending” for A Doll’s House (1879) for the first productions of Nora oder Ein Puppenheim in Germany.31 The cultural anthropologist Ulf Hannerz, writing on the local dimensions of cosmopolitan trajectories, has proposed a formula that may serve to describe the reward of symbolic capital for intellectuals from the peripheries: surrender abroad is mastery at home.32 The already mentioned example of Strindberg in Paris is illuminating. After causing various scandals at home, Strindberg began a period of exile in the 1880s, during which he was determined to become 30 31 32\n\nFor the latter, see Sylvain Briens, Paris: Laboratoire de la littérature scandinave moderne 1880–1905 (Paris: Harmattan, 2010).

He tried to give his work a French aspect by making significant adjustments to his texts for a French audience, including material considerations such as choosing an arrangement of type, layout, and paper that he considered typically French.33 It was probably important for him to succeed as a “French writer,” not only in order to penetrate the increasingly xenophobic cultural scene in Paris at the time,34 but also to gain valuable symbolic capital that he could mobilize within the Swedish context. From their self-consciously peripheral viewpoint, cosmopolitan Nordic intellectuals both struggled with and made use of the limits and possibilities of international intellectual life at the turn of the twentieth century. Like intellectuals in other periods, they saw themselves as a genuinely transnational category, and in the local debates of their respective Nordic peripheries they drew on the symbolic value associated with a transnational republic of letters. In international arenas they were, by contrast, confronted with a tendency to identify each participant, cosmopolitan or not, as a representative of his or her nation. Neiglick, who at home in Helsinki repeatedly emphasized the poor state of intellectual life in his native country, gladly acted as a cultural ambassador abroad when representing Finland at an international student meeting in Paris in the late 1880s.35 Individual actors thus shifted between different, even contrary, roles. There simply was no space beyond nationality, as was evident already in Goethe’s famous vision of a “world literature,” understood as a conversation between nations.36 A similar point was made by Brandes in an essay on world literature (1899) in which he also highlighted the importance of language. According to him, mediocre writers from dominant linguistic spheres had a much higher chance of international success than first-rate writers from second-rate linguistic regions.37 Intellectuals from small-country peripheries thus operated within double frames. Searching for a balance between their commitments in the national field and their allegiance to a cosmopolitan community, they were under no 33 34 35\n\n36 37\n\nThe latter concerns Strindberg’s self-translation of Fadren / Le Père.

But they could mobilize recognition abroad, as well as the interplay between mutually constitutive national and international spaces, in local debates and meritocratic struggles.\n\nThe Provincialism of the Province and the Provincialism of the Core\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that scientific or intellectual specialization and progress is only possible in an environment where the number of intellectuals working in a particular field is sufficiently large. “It is only here,” Rolf Lagerborg writes from Paris in 1895, “that I in my own discipline can find a trench to plough that is mine and only mine.” According to Lagerborg, Finland, as a small country, suffered from the lack of a critical mass and from the national imperative to which every field of culture and science was subjected.38 Cultural nationalism included an element of catching up in terms of accumulating symbolic capital from abroad. In small nations, this process resulted in a bland eclecticism, as noted in the early years of the twentieth century by the writer Eino Leino in Helsinki, as well as by Franz Kafka in Prague. While making room “for the Gods of all people and all times” (Leino) was a way to compensate for the lack of strong national models, these minor literatures (Kafka) risked being too heavily influenced by the fashionable writers of the moment, either through the introduction of new works of foreign literature or imitations of the foreign literature that had already been introduced.39 Roberto Schwartz provides another reflection on the predicament of peripheral intellectual life in his work on Brazilian culture, as seen from a center–­ periphery perspective and in terms of the relationship between imitation and innovation. Writing about the eagerness of Brazilian academic intellectuals to adopt new schools of thought from Europe or America, Schwartz notes that “[t]he thirst for terminological and doctrinal novelty prevails over the labor of extending knowledge and is another illustration of the imitative nature of our cultural life.”40 38 39\n\n40\n\nRolf Lagerborg, I egna ögon—och andras (Helsingfors: Söderströms, 1942), 192.

On the contrary, many have called attention to the more positive implications of the reflexive and inherently comparative mindset typical of the peripheries. In the context of industrial modernization, Thorstein Veblen, in his Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (1915), pointed to the relative ease by which latecomers such as Germany and Japan approached the frontiers of development, in comparison with the pioneer countries of the industrial revolution.41 In Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective (1962) the economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron, referring to differences in the speed and character of industrialization between pioneers and latecomers, made a similar point about the “advantages of backwardness.” By way of analogy the same observation can be extended to the intellectual sphere, where it appears that the more consciously peripheral a cultural field is, the easier it is for its members to adapt to changing sets of rules and norms. Adaptability and flexibility are necessities in a culture that constantly looks abroad. Nordic intellectuals were certainly quick to learn the languages and rules of France and Germany in the long nineteenth century. They adapted equally smoothly to the rising dominance of the Anglo-American cultural sphere in the period between 1930 and 1950. Historical reflexivity and the “advantages of backwardness” can thus be understood as the practice of, and willingness to, learn from the mistakes of regions that are conceived of as being more advanced, and in this way to anticipate social and intellectual developments.42 Whereas nineteenth-century Finnish legislators could propose measures for dealing with, for example, unwanted effects of industrialization before these became real problems in Finland, in the politico-intellectual context the analogous move would be to disarm and neutralize unwanted or potentially dangerous concepts and movements before they were introduced to the periphery.

When logical positivism was introduced to Finland and Norway in the 1930s, it was celebrated as a foreign innovation by Eino Kaila and Arne Næss, respectively. But when the same philosophy was introduced in England and Sweden, it was instead re-described as a continuation of, or parallel to, local traditions. Hence Alfred J. Ayer, on the very first page of his epochal Language, Truth and Logic (1936), described logical positivism as “the logical outcome” of British empiricism,44 while the Swedish philosopher Ingemar Hedenius used a series of rhetorical moves to tie it to the local Uppsala philosophical tradition of Axel Hägerström.45 The universalism of the cores can indeed lead to a peculiar form of provincialism. One indication of this is the reluctance to distinguish between ­national and international discussions.46 In Sweden, arguably the most universal Nordic country, it was possible until at least the 1950s or 1960s to publish ambitious philosophical texts in the national language. In Finland or Norway, by contrast, philosophers tended to make a clear distinction between their professional philosophical production in German, French, or English, and their more popular writings published in Finnish, Swedish, or Norwegian. Discussing the establishment of a Nordic philosophical journal with a Swedish colleague, Kaila strongly argued that there was no point whatsoever to a proper scientific journal being published in languages other than German, English, or French.47\n\n43\n\n44 45 46 47\n\nMalte Gasche and Johan Strang, “Der Kriegsinsatz des finnischen Philosophern Eino Kaila,” in Finnland und Deutschland: Studien zur Geschichte im 19. und 20.

And Benedict Anderson has, in exploring the comparative nature of nationalism, emphasized the multiple vision and double-consciousness that results from moving back and forth; the hero in José Rizal’s Noli me tangere (1887), having returned to Manila from Europe, sees simultaneously from close up and from afar.49 For Anderson, nationalism depends on such comparisons, and intellectuals in exile are often the ones making them. The perspective is also important for postcolonial scholars such as Edward Said: “Yet when I say ‘exile’ I do not mean something sad or deprived. On the contrary belonging, as it were, to both sides of the imperial divide, enables you to understand them more easily.”50 Such a double vision was at the heart of Georg Brandes’s comparative project on European literatures, as stated in the opening pages of the book series begun in 1872: “The comparative view possesses the double advantage of bringing foreign literature so near to us that we can assimilate it, and of removing our own until we are enabled to see it in its true perspective.”51 Insofar as there is an innovative potential in the comparative eclecticism of the periphery, it can perhaps be described in terms of a “reflexive consciousness” that follows from operating with multiple frames of reference simultaneously. In her account of world literature as a competitive field, Pascale ­Casanova notes that writers from the outside tend to be especially open to the latest inventions of international literature, but also particularly perceptive of structures of domination and aware of the obstacles involved in introducing aesthetic innovations internationally.52 Similarly, Henrik Stenius has stressed the extent to which peripheries are “translation cultures.”53 Constantly following foreign discussions and relating them to domestic developments, smallcountry intellectuals are wedged in a continuous process of translation and appropriation. This activity, Stenius argues, makes them less prone to fall into 48\n\nAn argument that we develop in “Con"
