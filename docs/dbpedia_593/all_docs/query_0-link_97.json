The history of this venture goes back to the meeting of a group of young scholars at the Balkan Summer University in Plovdiv in 1999. Step by step, a research project, hosted by the Center for Advanced Study Sofia, was formed with the intention of bringing together and making accessible basic texts of the respective national traditions. The ensuing ‘Reader’ was envisioned as a challenge to the self-centered and ‘isolationist’ historical narratives and educational canons prevalent in the region. On the whole, the ‘Reader’ is expected to fill in the lacunae concerning the knowledge of Central and Southeast Europe pertinent to the very core of the schooling process and academic socialization in these countries. It is hoped that our project will broaden the field of possible comparisons and make researchers look at the process of nation-building in Central and Southeast Europe from a comparative perspective. The grouping of the texts follows neither the national provenience, nor stricto sensu chronological order. It is determined more by thematic similarities and resonances. The four ‘meta-themes/periods,’ around which the volumes are organized, are the following: Late Enlightenment (the emergence of the modern ‘National Idea’); National Romanticism (the formation of national movements); Modernism (the full development of national movements and often the creation of national states along with the new formulations of national cultures); and Anti-Modernism (concentrating mainly on the radical ideologies of the inter-war period). Within these thematic units the project analyzes various aspects of identity-formation, such as ‘symbolic geography’, the symbolic representation of the national community, images of the past and the production of cultural markers (i.e., national language or national character), as well as the images of the other and the ‘construction’ of identity in religious and socio-cultural contexts – domains that themselves exhibit revealing similarities.\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis framework challenges the usual taxonomies through the disaggregation of a nominally unified past. In particular, this perspective questions the idea of a single point of departure that we are confronted with in nationalist histories. In fact, most of the texts selected consciously participate in many registers of identity-construction, seeking to turn the entire symbolic framework of identities into a more dynamic configuration. In order to create a common basis for the analysis of the collected texts, each entry has a similar structure. The first section refers to the bibliographical data containing the language in which the text was written, its author and the publishing house; this data is complemented by short information about the author, such as his (her) place of birth and death, a concise biography, and main works. The second section contains a short ‘contextualization’ of the text, describing its political and social background and the intellectual environment in which it originated. Then, a textual analysis, a description of its ideological tendencies and historical influence and its function in the respective canon follow. In addition, the most important interpretations of the text are provided. All this is followed by the translated texts. If possible, we chose to publish them in their entirety, but in many cases their length exceeded the dimensions of the volume, and thus we strove to present the most characteristic excerpts. * During the years of intensive research and interaction, our group incurred a number of precious debts. First of all, we would like to thank Diana Mishkova who supported the project from the beginning and has helped us far beyond the scope commonly expected from the director of a hosting institution to bring these volumes to completion. We are also extremely grateful to the entire staff of the Center for Advanced Study Sofia who facilitated our work immensely during our numerous meetings and provided a pleasant working atmosphere in all regards. No collaborative project of this sort is viable without substantial financial help making it possible for the participants to meet regularly. We are grateful to the Prince Bernhard Cultural Foundation (The Netherlands) for providing generous funding that made it possible for the group to meet on six occasions over the period of three years. When the first phase of the project was finished, the Foundation also offered a further grant to prepare the texts for publication. Without this generosity, it would have been impossible to share our findings with the broader public. Our special thanks goes to Wouter Hugen-\n\nTHE ‘IDENTITY READER’ PROJECT\n\n3\n\nholtz (NIAS), who took upon himself the role of introducing the project to the Foundation and who followed with immense trust and sympathy our work throughout these years. A natural focus of any comparative research in the region, the Central European University also gave us generous help to accomplish our venture. Most of all, we would like to thank László Kontler and Sorin Antohi who have been with us from the very beginning of the project, offering logistic help, sharing their advice with us and also contributing to the volumes with their insightful introductions. We are grateful to Halil Berktay (Sabancı University, Istanbul) for his intellectual support throughout these years and also for hosting us for a workshop in 2001 where the project was first presented to a broader academic public. In the process of preparing this third volume, we were able to obtain additional funding which enabled us to cover expenses for various purposes in different stages of our endeavour. We are grateful to the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) for sponsoring a meeting of the group at Boğaziçi University in November 2006, and the History Department there for providing logistical support. We are also grateful to Boğaziçi University for the generous grant it provided from its Research Fund, supporting the critical final stages in the preparation of the present volume. While preparing the manuscript for publication, the editor at CEU Press, Linda Kunos, provided us with important advice and took care of the burdensome institutional side of the publishing with exemplary commitment. Lastly, Benjamin Trigona-Harany, a junior colleague, took upon the burdensome task of editing the diverse body of texts linguistically. There are cases where current political controversies and the fluidity of the international landscape in the region under consideration led the editors of the volume to make choices out of necessity and pragmatism. Two new states have appeared in the period after the editorial group had conceived and carried out this project. We decided, however, that we should not reconsider our entire agenda to trace intellectual traditions in Montenegro and Kosovo, since this is first and foremost the task of those who are involved in the statebuilding processes in these countries. After all, apart from the immense human tragedy it involved, the fragmentation that the war in Yugoslavia has left behind also deposited issues of bitter cultural contestation. Therefore, we had to respect the choice of the contributors who described as Croatian, Serbian, Serbo-Croatian or Bosnian, depending on national provenience, a language which, despite certain local differences, had functioned as a shared form of expression in the region for many decades.\n\nMaria Todorova: Modernism\n\nLike culture and civilization, imperialism and orientalism, or nations and nationalism, modernity and modernism are concepts that suffer from overuse. Some scholars despair about the impossibility to reach a consensus about their meaning and use, and call on entirely abandoning them. Yet, they are with us to stay, among others because they have long ago left specialized scholarly discussion (or entered it too late) to become part of the everyday speech of many competing discourses. This volume, the third in a series covering the cultures of the coveted, emerging, flourishing and humiliated nation-states of the region of Central and Southeast Europe from the eighteenth to the twentieth century, boldly takes on the challenge. Writing this introduction entails a double bind. On the one hand, I was asked and agreed to provide a preface to a volume I did not help conceive. In a way, the resulting introduction is not merely a comment on the material compiled by several younger scholars and respected colleagues; it is inevitably an exegesis of its conceptualization. On the other hand, given the voluminous and controversial literature around the concept of modernism and its derivatives, this preface tentatively tries to provide some similitude of order, if only for the easier orientation though the ensuing material. Several questions will be asked in the course of this chapter: What is the difference between modernity, modernism and modernization? When and where was/is modernity, and when and where was/is modernism? Is it modernity or modernities? What is the comparative value of scrutinizing a particular region? Why, then, is this volume encompassed under the rubric of modernism and not of modernity? Modernism may be the least problematic term, even if slightly differing interpretations exist. Henri Lefebvre distinguishes between the two by positing that modernism is a sociological and ideological fact, the consciousness that epochs, periods, successive generations have of themselves; it consists of images and projections of the self. Modernity, on the other hand, is the attempt at knowledge, the beginning of reflexion. “Moder-\n\nMARIA TODOROVA: MODERNISM\n\n5\n\nnity differs from modernism, as a concept formed about society differs from social phenomena, as reflexion differs from facts.”1 This is, arguably, one of the more sophisticated approaches to modernity and modernism, treating the two as different but intertwined takes on reality mediated by the human agent. Most other authors consider modernism as the cultural response to the challenges of the modern condition, defined loosely as the compendium of traits such as industrialization, urbanization, and the emergence of a marketindustrial economy; the growth of centralizing and unifying state institutions with the accompanying development of specialized occupations tied to them, i.e. bureaucratization; the development of the modern political party system with mass participation, the secularization of political and social authority and different models of popular rule. Modernism in this view, as expressed for example by Anthony Giddens, who insists on its difference from modernity, is often seen mostly in its aesthetic dimension, and applied to styles or trends in literature, painting, sculpture, architecture, and music.2 In a broader handling, modernism is seen as the state of mind expressed in opposition to tradition, or as the culture of modernity. In a narrower sense, it is treated as the aesthetic and negative reaction to technological modernity (in this sense conflating modernity with modernization).3 An interesting twist in the thinking about modernism is offered by the view that while modernity was born in the West (even if authors differ on whether it is a universal or an entirely western phenomenon), modernism was the product of the periphery. 1 Henri Lefebvre, Introduction à la modernité (Paris, 1962), p. 10, cited in Alexis Nouss, La modernité (Paris, 1991), p. 21. 2 Anthony Giddens, The Consequences of Modernity, The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, 1990; Charles Taylor, “Nationalism and Modernity” in Beiner, Ronald, ed., Theorizing Nationalism (Albany NY, 1999); Eugene Lunn, Marxism and Modernism: An Historical Study of Lukács, Brecht, Benjamin, and Adorno (Berkeley, 1982); Jonathan Spencer, “Modernism, Modernity and Modernisation,” in Alan Barnard and Jonathan Spencer ed. Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology (London, 1996). It is symptomatic that, as a whole, “modernism” rarely finds a place in social sciences, which abound in theories about modernity and modernization, but its relatively prominent place in the humanities is assured. There is no entry on “modernism” in the International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences.. 3 Matei Calinescu, Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-Garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism (Durham, 1987), actually speaks of “two distinct and bitterly conflicting modernities,” one as a stage in the history of Western civilization (scientific and technological progress, industrial revolution, the sweeping economic and social changes of capitalism); the other, as an aesthetic concept opposed to the first (p. 41).\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIf “modernity” as a term seems to have been created by Chateaubriand in 1833, “modernism” was coined by a Nicaraguan poet in 1890: “the critique of European modernity, like so much of the modern itself, seems continually to have emerged from Europe’s borders.”4 Some authors even posit that modernism is not in the core, but always in the periphery, and they speak of the modernism of underdevelopment, where culture is one form through which one can belong if one is excluded from modernity. This certainly is very relevant to Eastern Europe, the first and closest periphery to the core of modernity. In a way, the whole four-volume project is an illustration of the particular cultural and political responses—defined by the editors as enlightenment, romanticism, modernism and anti-modernism—to the social transformations that occurred with the advent of modernity. Of course, one could claim that modernism in a very broad sense encompasses all these responses: it is the general expression and style of the modern times, the state of mind expressed in opposition to tradition, or the culture of modernity. From this point of view, since the general consensus is that modernity starts with the Enlightenment and, despite all the theorizing about post-modernism, we still seem to be within its longue durée, it includes chronologically the whole period covered by the project. The editors have chosen to use it in a stricter sense, giving it a very definite place between romanticism and anti-modernism and an approximate chronological span from the 1860s until the decade following the First World War. For them the answer to the question “When was modernism?” is unambiguous. One could say that it coincides with the period of the powerful and unimpeded ascendancy of industrialism and the nationstate, and one can read in its expressions the unabashed triumphalism of the notion of progress. Indeed, practically all parts of this volume illustrate one or another aspect of the ambitious and optimistic construction and consolidation of the nation-state: the major ideologies that shaped this process, the projects and programs dealing with institution building and the challenges posed by imperial legacies and minority problems, and the reflexion of these processes in the sciences and the arts. This poses the question whether modernity is synonymous with capitalism. It is a question overwhelmingly answered in the positive by theorists of modernity, from Karl Polanyi to Anthony Giddens. For Polanyi the defining 4\n\nTimothy Mitchell, Questions of Modernity (Minneapolis, London, 2000), p. 6. In this Mitchell follows Perry Anderson. See also B. Valade, “Modernity,” in Neil J. Smelser, Paul B. Baltes ed. International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Amsterdam, New York, 2001), p. 9940.\n\nMARIA TODOROVA: MODERNISM\n\n7\n\ncharacteristic of modern society is the self-regulating market, which as an institutional structure is typical only for our times. It is the extension of commodification to the three basic elements of industry—labor, land, and money—which was the inevitable consequence of the introduction of the factory system in a commercial society and which constituted the crucial difference from preceding economic systems. Giddens sees modernity as modes of organization of social life which emerged in Europe from about the seventeenth century onwards and which subsequently became more or less worldwide in their influence. He thus defines modernity as inherently characterized by globalization, whose main traits are the international division of labor, the global capitalist economy, the system of nation-states, and the global military order, 5 This stress on the economic aspects of modern society inevitably raises the question of modernization and its place in the overall theorizing of modernity. More recent theorizing emphasizes the Janus-like character of modernity in the west which is characterized by two intersecting visions of modernity: the Weberian societal/cultural modernity and the Baudelairian cultural/aesthetic modernity, where culture is the capricious and imperceptible “middle term.” In the Weberian vision, societal modernization fragments cultural meaning and unity. The Baudelairian vision, equally alert to the effects of modernization, seeks to redeem modern culture by aestheticizing it. Each has their bright and dark sides. Societal modernization was anticipated by Enlightenment philosophers as the improvement of material conditions, economic prosperity and political emancipation, technological mastery, and the general growth of specialized knowledge, but it also brought the existential experience of alienation and despair in a disenchanted world of deadening and meaningless routine. The bright side of the Baudelairian vision found aesthetic pleasure in the creative excitement of searching for a meaning, and portrayed modernization as a spectacle of speed, novelty, and effervescence. Its dark side stressed the absence of moral constraints where the aesthetic pursuit could deteriorate from disciplined Nietzschean self-assertion against an absurd world into self-absorption and hedonism.6 Modernity may not be explicitly addressed in this volume but it is implicitly present in its overall conception both as a sociological reality, i.e. the ensemble of traits defining the modern condition, as well as a discursive con5\n\nGiddens, The Consequences of Modernity; Karl Polanyi, The Great Transformation (Boston, 1964) (first published in 1944), pp. 43–57, 68–75, 163. 6 Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar, “On Alternative Modernities,” in Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar, ed., Alternative Modernities (Durham, 2001), pp. 8–9.\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nstruct. There have been numerous attempts to define modernity, even though one of its analysts desists from treating it as a concept: “If it is true that a notion is intuitive knowledge, synthetic and inaccurate enough about one thing, then modernity belongs to this type of mental representation which, as opposed to concept, does not offer clearly defined contours of the abstract object to which it refers.”7 We know intuitively that modern is what appears, exists and belongs to the present era, and modernism expresses a preference against tradition. Even before the emergence of modernity as a category, the understanding about what was modern was based on a dichotomy between “ancients” and “moderns” (the famous querelle des anciens et des modernes at the end of the seventeenth century), between authority and progress, between tradition and innovation. Indeed, Bruno Latour argues that the division of tradition from modernity is the central characteristic of the modernist project, where division and classification entail the work of purification.8 Jon Mitchell goes as far as attributing this tendency to dichotomize to a common Euro-American epistemology which divides the world into ‘modern’ and ‘traditional’, or Western and non-Western, and ultimately into ‘us’ and ‘them.’ Following Niklas Luhmann, he shows that, rather than being a homogenizing process producing a unified social whole, modernity constantly creates otherness; it is not a fixed and stable, but has differentiation at its core. He also amply demonstrates that ambivalence is common to all manifestations of modernity. In particular, the hierarchizing axis of tradition and modernity can be reversible, so that each side can be valorized at different moments. This ambivalence and anxiety is especially acute at the edges of Europe, where the stakes are higher.9 Similarly, stressing the ambivalence between what is modern and what traditional, Diana Mishkova shows that the distinction between nineteenth-century modernizers in Serbia and Romania (the radicals and the liberals) and traditionalists (the conservatives) is not so sharp. In actuality, all used the modern legitimizing norms and rhetoric; 7\n\nValade, op. cit., p. 9939. Bruno Latour, We Have Never Been Modern (London, 1993). Since division entails a prior assumption of unity—each proposition of difference must begin with an assumption of sameness—dividing the world into traditional and modern must begin with the assumption of a shared historical trajectory. This, in the end, makes Latour question the utility of the concept “modern.” 9 Jon P. Mitchell, Ambivalent Europeans: Ritual, Memory and the Public Sphere in Malta, (London and New York, 2002), pp. 12 and 241–242. For example, accession to EU in Malta is seen as both promise (security, affluence, democracy, modernity) and threat (to family, morality, community, tradition).

Despite nuances of difference, the common denominator of most theories that analyze the modern era, i.e. modernity, is to describe the process of capitalist expansion, development and globalization through which the nonWestern becomes Western. This is based on the presumption that increased globalization of the world economy necessarily entails the homogenization of socio-cultural forms. This trend was most explicitly present in the modernization theories of 1950s–60s, where the successful accomplishment of industrialization and democratization were seen as the apogee of modernization.11 The severe critique to which modernization theory was subjected in the late 1970s and 1980s led to a broader critical theorization of capitalism. It prompted its theoretical reconceptualization with the emergence and introduction of a new category: modernity. Modernity was taken by the social sciences to unite, or mediate, modernization and capitalism, and define and describe the properties of the modern, “present social configuration.” It thus came to define a way of life or mode of being, raising the question whether people who don’t live this way are modern or not.12 Chronologically, the consensus that modernity started in Western Europe after the seventeenth century (in a few readings even earlier) has not been 10\n\nДиана Мишкова, Приспособяване на свободата: модерност – легитимност в Сърбия и Румъния през XIX век.

Yet the stress is no longer exclusively on its economic performance. Sociologists are emphasizing the unparalleled degree of structural-functional differentiation in modern societies, especially the infrastructural powers of the nation-state. Building on Talcott Parsons, Jürgen Habermas and Niklas Luhmann, Nikos Mouzelis understands modernity as “a type of social organization which, from a socialintegration point of view, is characterized by an unprecedented level of social mobilization/incorporation into the center; and from the point of view of system integration, by an equally unprecedented level of institutional differentiation.”13 This leads to the destruction of segmented localism and the creation of broader, highly differentiated economic, political, social, and cultural arenas where the practices of individuated subjects are constituted and regulated by institutional complexes such as the nation-state, national markets and/or national planning agencies, national systems of welfare and population surveillance/management, mass literacy and nationalist ideologies. Similarly, but with a stronger emphasis on mentalité, Zygmunt Bauman locates the defining feature of modernity in its concern with order, not so much industrialism or capitalism, because “the preoccupation with orderly, manageable society, is a common denominator of other modern undertakings […] to make human affairs regular and amenable to planning and control was high up in the mind of the principle advocates and actors of industrialism, democracy, and capitalism.”14 For Bauman modernity and the awareness of the artificiality of social order are synonymical, and the characteristically modern obsession with ordering is the outcome of that awareness. As he points out, “from its inception, ‘modernity’ was known in one form only: that of ‘managerial’ modernity, an order-designing and order-administering modernity.”15 Bauman is also the one who unequivocally links modernity not merely to capitalism but specifically to imperialism in the era of the nation-state. This comes with a new perception of time; indeed, Bauman postulates that “the history of time began with modernity,” modernity being “more than anything else, the history of time: modernity is the time when time has a history.” Modernity emancipated time from space because, unlike space, time could be changed and manipulated through technical innovation. “Whoever traveled faster could claim more territory—and, having done that, could control it, 13 Nikos Mouzelis, “Modernity: a non-European conceptualization,” British Journal of Sociology, vol. 50, No.1, March 1999, pp. 143–144 and 156–157. 14 Zygmunt Bauman & Keith Tester, Conversations with Zygmunt Bauman (Cambridge, 2001), p. 78. 15 Ibid., p. 74.\n\nMARIA TODOROVA: MODERNISM\n\n11\n\nmap it and supervise it... Modernity was born under the stars of acceleration and land conquest.”16 Peter Osborne provides another analysis of the explicit link and hierarchical relationship between modernity and nationalism. According to him, the problem is “not how to rethink the notion of modernism from the standpoint of national cultures (modernism as national allegory, for example). It is, rather, how the problematic of the modern, concretely applied, can help replace the problematic of ‘national cultures’, with a broader conception of the temporal-cultural dimensions of social relations—social relations through which ‘the nation’ is itself produced as a cultural-ideological effect of various forms of state power.” Applying his very broad understanding of modernism as “a particular temporal logic of negation (the new)” together with the metaphor and theory of translation, Osborne succeeds in dissolving the discreteness of separate nationalisms and their cultures.17 We see them floating, with their ships of different size and shape, and colorful crews, which are often in conflict or fleeting alliances, in the common sea of modernity. Thus the nation-state comes to the fore as the prototypical institutional embodiment of political modernity, nationalism in the apt expression of Josep Llobera is its god, and “the nation, as a culturally defined community, is the highest symbolic value of modernity; it has been endowed with a quasisacred character equaled only by religion.”18 Even a cursory look at the present volume will bear this out. From the different ideological approaches dealing with the imperial heritage and finessing projects of how to create the modern state—liberal, conservative, socialist and others—to the literary and scientific attempts at squaring the circle of individual and collective identities, the obsession with the nation, its territory and the institutions that would serve it best is obvious. It is a well-known fact that this period saw the gradual crumbling of the three empires that between themselves controlled much of what is designated as Central and Southeast Europe, or altogether Eastern Europe: the Habsburg, Ottoman and Romanov Empires. In the course of less than a century, a multitude of small to medium-sized nation-states appeared in the east of Europe, beginning in the Balkans: Greece (independence 1830), Serbia (autonomy 1830, independence 1878), Montenegro (independence 1878), Romania (unification 1859, independence 1878), Bulgaria (autonomy 16\n\n112.\n\n17\n\nZygmunt Bauman, Liquid Modernity (Cambridge, Mass, 2000), p. 110 and\n\nPeter Osborne, Philosophy in Cultural Theory (London, 2000), pp. 59 and 61.

Russia alone preserved the similitude of empire (some would argue its essence) with the creation of the Soviet Union (1922). For Eastern Europe the nation-state proved to be the central of the pillars of stability. It was the nation-state that was to provide and guarantee all other aspects of modern social life: industrialization, universal education, political rights, etc. In all of the countries of Central and Southeast Europe, and arguably more so in the societies of the southeast that had embarked somewhat earlier on the road to national independence, nation building was linked to the victory of the centralizing state over traditional forms of decentralized communal self-rule. This, in the end, produced everywhere powerful antagonisms between the state and society, between the city and the countryside, between the peasants and the bureaucracy.19 Yet, at the beginning, before the achievement of sovereign statehood, the advent of mass society together with the spread of the ideals of social justice and equality were mostly subordinated to the idea of equality between nations. This powerful idea was channeled into equally powerful movements aimed at reform, different types of adjustment of ethnic minorities within the old imperial frameworks, most remarkable among them the different visions of federative arrangements, and ultimately independent nation-states. The vindication of the nation-state came with a price everywhere in Europe, not only in the east, and gradually transformed the liberal and altogether inclusive character of the early to midnineteenth-century national doctrines by way of the conservative, exclusivist, and irredentist policies of the new political elites.20 19 Wofgang Höpken, “Zentralstaat und kommunale Sebstverwaltung in Bulgarien 1880–1910.

Everywhere, even though seriously lagging behind the economic development of Western Europe, the half century leading to the First World War saw remarkable levels of economic resurgence, the flourishing of light industries, the beneficial effect on industries from high state expenditure on railway construction, the European arms’ race, the development of technologies, industrial concentration, protectionism and cartelization. Everywhere, modernization was seen as the prime instrument to close the temporal and spatial lag vis-à-vis the west, and everywhere the often debilitating consciousness of this gap was the primary motor of activity. It has to be added in parenthesis that probably because of this, modernization as a concept has had a much more favorable fate in Eastern Europe and was never entirely purged from its vocabulary. Modernization was always seen as the most potent catching-up device, “the process of long-term change that transforms a society resting on agriculture and its related political and social structures into an industrial society based on technological advancement, secularized culture, bureaucratic administration, and extensive (however shallow) forms of political participation.”23 Writing about Turkey, Sibel Bozdoğan and Reşat Kasaba welcome the emphasis on cultural identity, difference, and diversity over the homogenization and universalist claims and aspirations of modernization. Yet, they also point out the need to reclaim the universal and liberating potential of modernization as a world-historical liberating process that made it possible for people to pursue their individual interests while forming meaningful collectivities. “Just as we need to distinguish between modernity as a potentially liberating historical condition and its instrumentalization for a political project of domination, we also need to distinguish between the democratic implications of the recent post-modern critique, on the one hand, and its self-closure into a new form of orthodoxy.”24 All this raises two additional issues with extraordinary relevance for Eastern Europe: the notion and manifestations of backwardness, and the concept of alternative or multiple modernities. The sense of lag and lack, analytically subsumed in the notion of backwardness, has been a dominant trope not only in East European or, more broadly, in non-European perceptions. For long decades, it had been painfully present in German self-perceptions.25 It con23\n\nIan Kershaw and Moshe Levin, Stalinism and Nazism.

In the East European context, more so than in other non-western contexts, the literature on backwardness is dominated by economic historians and political scientists. In fact, some authors have argued that the subdiscipline of economic development was created in the 1940s mostly by East Europeans who employed the cases of Eastern Europe as their original empirical base.26 If cultural aspects are discussed, it is only by way of weighing cultural traditions as impediments or promoters of development. Questions like “Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in the West?” and “What causes economic growth?” are the ones that frame the discussion and while there are different explanatory systems—the dominant among them Marxism, even when unacknowledged; world systems theory, especially center-periphery relations; modernization theory; geographic determinism; and cultural determinism (in this order)—there is an overall consensus that Eastern Europe has been lagging economically at least since the sixteenth—seventeenth centuries and maybe as far back as the eleven-twelfth centuries, but in any case long before it was absorbed into the wider western world market.27 As far as the explanations for this economic backwardness 26\n\nJoseph L. Love evokes the names of Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, Ragnar Nurske, Kurt Martin, Hans Singer, Alexander Gerschenkron, Peter Bauer, Paul Baran, Michał Kalecki and others. Love, Crafting the Third World: Theorizing Underdevelopment in Rumania and Brazil (Stanford, 1996), p. 6. Love argues that “in the interwar period […] the newly independent and newly configured nations of East Central Europe constituted a ‘proto’-Third World in which the problems of economic and social backwardness were first confronted and formally theorized, against a range of development options, which included Soviet socialism.” (p. 214). 27 See the important collective volume of Daniel Chirot, ed., The Origins of Backwardness in Eastern Europe: Economics and Politics from the Middle Ages until the Early Twentieth Century (Berkeley, 1989), which was the result of a conference at Bellagio in 1985 and includes the first-class articles of Chirot, Robert Brenner, Peter Gunst, Jacek Kochanowicz, Fikret Adanir, John Lampe and Gale Stokes. This approach has produced important research, and at least a few other works are worth mentioning, even if they do not necessarily reach identical conclusions: John Lampe and Marvin R.

These explanations range from social-structural ones of a historical longue durée (Jenő Szűcs) to reversing the premises of the debate: it is rapid growth rather than a tendency to stagnation that is exceptional, and Eastern Europe, from this point of view, is normalized with the rest of the world where western Europe is seen as the exception that ought to be explained.28 Addressing the issue as “the trap of backwardness,” I suggested elsewhere that it should be approached through the concept of relative synchronicity within a longue durée framework, a perspective that circumvents the trap of origins, which carries backwardness as its corollary.29 While I focused mostly on the discourse of backwardness in a cultural milieu, especially the conceptualization of comparative nationalisms, the model can be applied more broadly. After all, industrialization faces a similar challenge as nationalism. Not only did it take place over the course of several centuries over Europe, even in its core space, England, it took several centuries for its accomplishment and penetration into different areas of the country and into different branches of the industry (the eighteenth and nineteenth, or, according to a different interpretation, the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries).

The latter way of thinking was inspired by the significant impact of the work of Eric L. Jones, The European Miracle: Environments, Economies, and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia (Cambridge, 1981). 29 Maria Todorova, “The trap of backwardness: modernity, temporality and the study of Eastern European nationalism,” Slavic Review, 64, 1, Spring 2005, pp. 140– 164.\n\nMARIA TODOROVA: MODERNISM\n\n17\n\ntures of this development were different (with pioneers and laggards in each case) but still nobody questions the epistemological adequacy of describing them within the same overall process (and the respective category). Moreover, at the end of the day, when in particular places the process has reached some completion, and is considered successful or acceptable, no one is interested in the original and the possible deviations thereof. The reformulation I proposed is not undertaken for the sake of political correctness or diplomacy, but in order to make a methodological point. While the description that favors a distinct primary place and the transmission of the original pattern presupposes distinct geographic and historical spaces, usually clustered around the separate nation-states that were the habitus of modernity, the other involves Eastern Europe in a common long-term process. It, thus, redefines the region as part of a common space (European or global) which evolves, and one of whose characteristics is the homogenization (or, rather, imagined homogenization) of polities. It also allows us to deconstruct the category ”west” and transform it from a model-like entity into a dynamic one which itself underwent the process unevenly and over a long period of time. Thus the notion of relative synchronicity within the longue durée of modernity, even as it does not exclude the existence of asynchronic developments, allows us to describe them not simply in terms of linear consecutive phenomena, diffusion and one-way transmissions, but also, in some aspects, as a process that emphasizes its dialogical nature. For example, much of the romantic passion of George Byron and Alexander Pushkin cannot be understood outside the influence of Greek nationalism; the Polish partitions and the ensuing mobilization of Polish nationalism created waves that inspired a variety of responses, from philosophers beginning with Rousseau to the crystallization of a specific Russophobia in nineteenth-century Europe that goes a long way in explaining subsequent European international relations; the German preoccupations with folklore cannot be understood without the Serb connection, nor the introduction of the moral principle (although not necessarily morality) in British Gladstonian politics without the impetus of Bulgarian nationalism and the retaliation it invoked. In a larger context, Timothy Mitchell insists that putting empire back into the history of Europe enables the reversal of the narrative of modernization so as to see the West as the product of modernity.30 Still, no matter how we deal with this problematique today (and the materials in the volume abundantly bear out such an approach), it is a fact that in 30\n\nTimothy Mitchell, Questions of Modernity , p. 15.\n\n18\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe time period covered by the readings (and, arguably, until the present if not in such dire degree), politicians and intellectuals in Eastern Europe had deeply internalized the sense of lack and lag, which either paralyzed them or prompted a volley of hectic reformist activities. In the Greek case, and this can be extended easily to the others, “Greek culture became ‘traditional’ only when it began to view itself as an inferior past living in the present—the European present. At that point, it emerged as a problem to be dealt with. It became something either to be rejected, which is to say, modernized, or to be re-invented, re-interpreted, re-valued and used, after the European fashion, as a defense against the modern.”31 As Gregory Jusdanis puts it: “Belated modernization, especially in nonwestern societies necessarily remains ‘incomplete’ not because it deviates from the supposedly correct path but because it cannot culminate in a faithful duplication of western prototypes.” Favoring the concept of “many modernities,” he therefore concludes that peripheral societies “internalize the incongruity between western originals and local realities as a structural deficiency.”32 Yet how we deal with it today is more than relevant. After all it is “the problem of how to write of forms of modernity that deviate from the canonical understanding of the term.”33 Some still insist on the necessity of an ideal-typical form, usually equated with and distilled from West European examples. Others speak of alternative, multiple or plural modernities. Still others deny modernity’s heuristic value by arguing that everything in the world is by definition modern, alternatively or not. The counter-stream to the homogenization theory of modernity is a fairly recent phenomenon of the last little over a decade, and focuses on the heterogeneity of global modernity. Arguing that the modern was produced not within Europe alone, it pluralizes modernity and explores “alternative modernities” or “multiple capitalisms,” 31 Vasso Argyriou, “Tradition, Modernity and European Hegemony in the Mediterranean,” Journal of Mediterranean Studies, vol. 12, No. 1, 2002, p. 34. Augusta Dimou demonstrates how “belated” modernity inflected the response of socialists. While social democrats in western countries saw their principal task in exposing, analyzing, and mitigating the exigencies of the modernization process, the Bulgarian social democrats first tried to persuade public opinion and their adversaries that modernization was the desired, necessary and unavoidable path for the country (Augusta Dimou, Entangled Paths Toward Modernity: Contextualizing socialism and nationalism in the Balkans (Budapest, 2009). 32 Gregory Jusdanis, Belated Modernity and Aesthetic Culture: Inventing National Literature (Minneapolis, 1991), p. xiii. 33 Dipesh Chakrabarty, Habitations of Modernity : Essays in the Wake of Subaltern Studies (Chicago, 2002), p. xx.\n\nMARIA TODOROVA: MODERNISM\n\n19\n\nstressing local, regional and global forces that shape particular histories of capitalist modernity.34 Much of this was generalized and theorized by Shmuel N. Eisenstadt in a series of important works. Following Weber, Eisenstadt understands the core of modernity as the deconstruction of the God-ordained worldview of all axial civilizations. Since modern societies are no longer embedded in transcendental orders, they are open to continuous transformation and adaptation. For Eisenstadt, modernity is characterized by open political arenas and changing collective identities, autonomy of man in relation to authority, and multiplicity of competing visions of the public good. Traditions, instead of being dissolved by modernity, serve as its sources for perpetual constitution and reconstitution. Eisenstadt posited that the cultural and political program of modernity was first developed in Western and Central Europe when significant shifts occurred in the conception of human agency which allowed the conception of a future characterized by possibilities realizable through autonomous human agency. At the same time, various cultures undergoing modernization develop distinctive reaction patterns, institutions and ethical conceptions. There is, in this sense, a continual reinterpretation of the cultural program of modernity and, thus, the construction of multiple modernities, attempts by various groups and movements to reappropriate and redefine the discourse of modernity in their own terms. Moreover, the forms of modernity that developed in North and Latin America are not fragments of the Old World, but crystallizations of new civilizations. All these civilizations share the central structural and ideational cores of modernity.35 34 On alternative modernities, see: M. Featherstone, S. Lash and R.

He argues against using the term for a historical or social epoch, but for a political project linked to the development of the nation-state. The multiplicity of modernity, according to him, lies not in a plurality of modernities, but consists of a plurality of histories of the singular modernity, in which the emergence of the nation-state has differed.”38 Most sophisticated theorists, no matter what the preference, tend to reach some kind of a consensus. Dilip Gaonkar, who thinks in terms of alternative modernities, insists that it is impossible to abandon the western discourse on modernity. Modernity has traveled from the West to the rest of the world not only in term of cultural forms, social practices, and institutional arrangements, but also as a form of discourse that interrogates the present. Therefore, even if expressed in vernacular or cosmopolitan idioms, the legacy of the western discourse is inescapable. Wherever one is, one must think with and against the tradition and reflections from Marx to Weber through Baudelaire and Benjamin to Habermas and Foucault.39 Jon Mitchell, following Van der Veer, builds his analysis on the premise that modernity is a singular the West (New York, 1987); Eisenstadt, The Great Revolutions and the Civilizations of Modernity (Leiden, Boston, 2006), pp. 131–158. 36 Stacy Pigg has argued against the concept of the modern as universal, proposing instead to attribute its influence to its cosmopolitan nature, as if modifying an adjective from the Latin to the Greek would suddenly purify its subject.

Modernity, like capitalism, is defined by its claim to universality, to a uniqueness, unity, and universality that represents the end (in every sense) of history. Yet this always remains an impossible unity, an incomplete universal. Each staging of the modern must be arranged to produce the unified, global history of modernity, yet each requires those forms of difference that introduce the possibility of a discrepancy, that return to undermine its unity and identity. Modernity thus becomes the unsuitable yet unavoidable name for all these discrepant histories.”42 Without imposing or even suggesting an explicit preference, this volume offers ample material to explore some of these options. Do we approach Eastern Europe as part of a universal, if not entirely homogenizing and singular modernity? Is it the case that it can be better explained in terms of an alternative modernity or even multiple modernities? The richness and variety of texts, and the privileging of the thematic approach convincingly gesture in the direction of a successful transcendence of national boundaries which has been the organizing principle in the majority of regional surveys. Here, we can see the agents of modernity breathing the same air, thinking the same thoughts, even if they do not always converse with each other. True, the very fact that the comparative potential of the material is confined within the East European region comes with its own caveats. The East-West duality can be broken only by setting a general European or global framework, in which the 40\n\nJon P. Mitchell, Ambivalent Europeans, pp. 241.

This view tallies well with Taylor’s two theories of modernity, an “acultural” one that views transition as a set of culture-neutral operations transforming any traditional society, and a cultural theory which holds that modernity always unfolds within a specific cultural and civilizational context (Charles Taylor, “Two theories of Modernity,” in Dilip P.

Setting the East European experience apart risks inadvertently reifying it into a discrete phenomenon. Yet this in no way is a deficiency of the volume’s conceptualization. It has to bear the burden of the existing state of historiographical accumulation and achievement, but it does so admirably. In the end, the appreciation of the universal choir can come only after one hears and learns to appreciate the distinct and original voices of the region’s soloists.\n\nCHAPTER I. MAKING OF THE MODERN STATE IN A MULTI-NATIONAL CONTEXT\n\nFRANTIŠEK PALACKÝ: THE IDEA OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE\n\nTitle: Idea státu rakouského (The idea of the Austrian state) Originally Published: Národ, a set of eight articles published between 9 April and 16 May, 1865 Language: Czech The excerpts used are from František Palacký, Spisy drobné 1: Spisy a řeči z oboru politiky, ed. by Bohuš Rieger (Prague: Bursík a Kohout, 1900– 03), pp. 218–226, 261–267.\n\nAbout the author František Palacký [1798, Hodslavice (Ger. Hotzendorf, north Moravia) – 1876, Prague]: politician and historian. He came from a traditional Protestant (Bohemian Brethren) family in Moravia. He studied at the Lutheran Latin School in Trencsén (Slo. Trenčín, present-day Slovakia) and the Lutheran Lyceum in Pressburg (Hun. Pozsony; Slo. Prešporok; present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), where he became acquainted with the ideas of Czech patriotism and Slavic reciprocity. Among his friends were Ján Benedikti, Pavel Josef Šafařík and Jan Kollár. After 1818, he was tutor to several Hungarian noble families, and was concerned principally with philosophy and aesthetics. The liberal-minded environment of Upper Hungary at that time and his experience gained in noble circles opened up the world of European culture and academic life for the young Palacký. In 1823, he went to Prague with the intention of studying Czech history, in particular the Hussite period. He was employed as a genealogist for the aristocratic Sternberg family, and studied historical methods under the tutelage of Josef Dobrovský. In 1829, the Estates appointed Palacký ‘Historian of the Bohemian Kingdom.’ At the same time he was instrumental in providing the Czech patriots with a firm institutional background for their cultural endeavors. In 1827, he started the Časopis Společnosti Vlasteneckého museum v Čechách (Journal of the Patriotic Museum Society in Bohemia) the most important Czech scholarly journal of the period. He also made important contributions in 1831 to the Matice česká, a foundation that supported the publication of books written in Czech. As a secretary of the ‘Patriotic Museum Society,’ he proposed in 1841 that the main task of the museum should be to present Bohemian scholarship, and he turned it into an important centre of ‘national academic life.’ Palacký entered politics in 1848 as a member of the Czech National Committee and became a deputy to the Reichsrat (Imperial Diet) and the president of the 1848 Slavic Congress in Prague. Moreover, he was a delegate to the Constituent Assembly of 1848–1849. He also formulated the liberal political program of the bourgeoisie, and later became the un-\n\n26\n\nMAKING OF THE MODERN STATE IN A MULTI-NATIONAL CONTEXT\n\nchallenged intellectual leader of the liberal National Party and remained so until the end of his life. He retired from active politics in the neo–absolutist period of the 1850s, but resumed his involvement in the 1860s, after the reinstatement of constitutional rule. He was a deputy to the Bohemian Diet and, in 1861, became the only Czech ever elected to the upper chamber of the Reichsrat. In subsequent years Palacký was one of the chief opponents of dualism and a supporter of the historical ‘state rights’ (Staatsrecht) arrangement of the Empire as opposed to the AustroHungarian Compromise of 1867. After 1871, he concentrated on publishing collections of his articles on politics, aesthetics, history, and literature, as well as working to complete his magnum opus, Dějiny národu českého v Čechách a v Moravě (History of the Czech nation in Bohemia and Moravia). Palacký remained a leading personality of the Czech national movement for more than fifty years. In the national historical canon he used to be referred to as the ‘father of the nation’; for his monumental academic work he has been dubbed the ‘founder’ of modern Czech historiography.

Referring to the October Diploma, he suggested that the federalization of Austria should be implemented. Such hopes, however, faded after the constitution of 1861, the ‘February Patent.’ The government set out to work with the German liberals and the Austrian pro-constitution nobility, while Czech liberals began to coordinate their policy with the conservative nobility of Bohemia. In response to the ascendant dualist Austro-Hungarian solution to the constitutional conflict, the recognition of historical Bohemian state rights as being equal to Hungarian state rights became the main demand of Czech liberal politics in the 1860s. In the course of the decade, Palacký strove to justify the idea of equality between nations as a true historical mission and a principle to revitalize the Austrian multinational state. He tried to defend his conception of federalism against the proponents of centralist and dualist concepts.\n\nFRANTIŠEK PALACKÝ: THE IDEA OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE\n\n27\n\nIn the spring of 1865, Palacký published a series of articles called ‘The Idea of the Austrian State,’ which turned out to be the most extensive and elaborate of his political treatises. At first he followed the historical development of the coexistence of Central European nations and pointed out the basic reason for their unification, namely to create a common state that could counter the threat of the expanding Ottoman Empire at the first half of the sixteenth century. In addition, Palacký argued that the Austrian state had become the hallmark of the Counter-Reformation and reaction against progress and modern enlightenment. But the situation changed in the mid-nineteenth century, when the Weltgeist manifested itself in the idea of the equality of nations. To implement this equality did not mean, he argued, the destruction of great multinational states because in the process of ‘world centralization,’ the small nations—self-standing moral and legal entities according to Palacký—must help each other against the large ones and thus balance out the historical powers of centralization that tend to make everything uniform. The true reason Austria should exist was to guarantee the freedom, justice and security of the small Central European nations on the basis of their equality. Palacký refused both the concept of centralization developed by the Viennese government and the concept of the dual monarchy favored by leading Hungarian politicians, while criticizing German and Magyar hegemonic tendencies. Instead, he basically proposed his original federalization concept of 1848/49, though with some important corrections. He did not change the emphasis on national self-determination and basic liberal tenets. He did, however, combine this with other elements, especially with the concept of historical rights, referring to József Eötvös’s theory on the historical and political individuality of the Crown lands in Austria. This also was why ‘The idea of the Austrian state’ has sometimes been understood as being in opposition to Palacký’s 1848/49 concept of ethnic federalization. In this respect the apparent contradiction between two of his famous dicta was usually pointed out: “We [the Slavs] existed before Austria, and we shall exist after her!” (1865), and “If the Austrian State had not existed for ages, it would have been in the interests of Europe and indeed of humanity to endeavor to create it as soon as possible” (1848) (See František Palacký, Letter to Frankfurt). Despite Palacký’s strong pessimism regarding the ability of Austria to reform itself, however, the 1865 article is by no means a program for independence. Some interpretations stress the shift of the argumentation from the doctrine of natural rights towards the politics of historical state rights. More sympathetic accounts regard these two aspects\n\n28\n\nMAKING OF THE MODERN STATE IN A MULTI-NATIONAL CONTEXT\n\nnot as contradictory, but as complimentary, a necessary combination under the political circumstances. Since its publication, Idea státu rakouského has been perceived as the most important statement of Czech liberal politics in terms of its relation to the Austrian state in the nineteenth century. As such, it also received a lot of attention and support among Czech, Croat, Polish and other federalist groups in the Monarchy. On the other hand, it drew criticism from political opponents immediately after its German translation (Oesterreichs Staatsidee) was published in 1866. Every subsequent Czech political argument regarding Austria referred to this article, and, despite the fact that federalization was never realized, it was only during the First World War that the alternative concept of an independent Czech or Czechoslovak state gained substantial support. Afterwards, however, it still remained an emblematic expression of the mainstream Czech liberal federalist position, and as such has been referred to in numerous subsequent discussions on the coexistence, or even the possible reintegration, of various nations in Central Europe. MK The idea of the Austrian state The principle of the equality of nations is as old as the doctrine of natural law in general. The source of both is the source from which morality and law stem, that is to say, a commandment implanted deep in the human heart: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” However, it took long and cruel struggles before this divine spark was lit in the soul of man and caught fire to the extent that it could stand on its own and resist brutishness, that is to say, raw and all-consuming egoism. This is also why it happened that civil, or, better said, interpersonal, law was recognized and took precedence over international law. Indeed, physical violence between nations was for centuries decisive, and mostly remains decisive to this day. With the progress of civilization, however, principles of law were formed in this respect, too, which attained general recognition in our century. But the historical fact that originally every nation used to have its own government and was therefore its own state entity meant that the law between states and the law between nations were for centuries considered, and are for the most part still considered, identical. Although the progress of world centralization and decentralization long ago caused the terms ‘state’ and ‘nation’ to cease to be one and the same, to cease to overlap, more than one\n\nFRANTIŠEK PALACKÝ: THE IDEA OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE\n\n29\n\nnation has divided up into several states and more than one state has sometimes contained several nations. […] That the feeling, consciousness and validity of the principle of nationality, in this sense, has in our age gained in strength and grown in all corners and lands of the earth is a truth that neither friends nor foes will deny. […] One dares to say that it has never been one of the Lord’s commandments that the universe should be uniform. That is why the role of the principle of nationality is, and will forever remain, in the administration of the world, and all human railing against it and taking up arms is like blowing into the wind; one may blow insignificant crumbs here and there, but that always turns out to be useless with larger amounts. This principle is still only in the early stages of its powerful effect, and the mortal eye is unable to see where it will end. Is it not irrelevant to ask whether nationality in this sense (providing there is a difference between the nation and the state) is based on reality or whether it is a mere fiction, an empty abstraction? And if, as I hope, no one denies the reality of nationality, it is appropriate to ask: Is or is not every nation in its whole some sort of moral and legal entity? I assume that at least among thinkers there will be no doubt about that. Nations, such as the Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, and Germans, are a reality, they are individual and living wholes, each has its own consciousness, its desires, its common interests and consequently its rights and obligations: they are therefore moral and legal entities. And no one will deny that Germans, for example, those who live in the states of Austria, Prussia, Russia and France, have their own common national interests, for which they may make claims in full and friendly agreement, even if their governments and therefore these states argued and clawed at each other till they drew blood. […] In the ‘Bach Period,’ the principle of national equality may never have been expressly denied from above, but another principle, one that was discordant with it, indeed in outright opposition to it, acquired greater and greater validity both in theory and in practice: it was the principle of the spreading of German culture to the East. If it were understood sincerely, and if the proponents of this doctrine resembled the Apostles, accepting the Holy Ghost from above in order to spread the Gospel to all nations in their natural languages (see Acts 2), there would be nothing particular in their actions to object to; it could even be gratefully accepted. But even children immediately saw that it was a mere euphemism that concealed the attempt to raise German nationality to a place where it would not only rule over the other nationalities in Austria, but would also gradually undermine them and ultimately rob them of their lives. All culture, that is to say, all spiritual culture,\n\n30\n\nMAKING OF THE MODERN STATE IN A MULTI-NATIONAL CONTEXT\n\nand consequently all national life were clearly meant to be dependent solely on the German language, after which the death of other nationalities would naturally follow. This would not have been wrong or an injustice, providing some nations were not conscious of themselves and of a national life, providing the nations did not consider their national existence something dear and desirable and providing they did not intend to preserve and defend it. In our day, however, when nations, no matter how neglected and asleep, awaken one after the other as soon as they are touched with the magic wand of modern enlightenment, the torture and murder of nationalities becomes a sin that is no less flagrant than the torture and murder of any rational creature of God. […] Now we shall posit the following premises: (1) in the state of Austria, rights and the law (that is, the will of the state), rather than physical violence or the arbitrariness of one over the other, are supposed to reign supreme; (2) the state of Austria is comprised of diverse nations; (3) no nation has any right over any other nation, nor can any nation use any other nation as a means to its own ends. Consequently, I do not see how from those premises, without blatantly false reasoning, anything other than the equality of nations in Austria may be deduced. […] The fact that with the creation of the Austrian Empire more than three centuries ago, and by way of voluntary agreements, such diverse nations joined together in one state entity is something I consider a great boon of divine Providence for all of them. […] This sort of union did not, however, provide enough room for the ambition and imperiousness or domineeringness of individuals amongst them; but were there, then, fewer opportunities to practice civil virtue? After all, bad honor achieved from the use of violence does not essentially differ from the honor or, better said, the shame, of thieves, except in its extent. If someone objects that this union has not always led to the benefit or welfare of the individual parts of the whole, I shall not deny that rather a lot happened that should not have happened, and that various things could have and should have been conducted better, but a just judgment about the past belongs to the Lord God and History. Political considerations should, however, include lessons learnt from the past, yet they should turn their attention to the present and the future in order that at least what in the past proved itself to be defective and detrimental be removed from the state system. […] Statesmen are trying to frame the constitution of the Austrian Empire on centralistic and dualistic foundations, a contradictory effort which is based on foundations that undermine each other and are repugnant both to law and\n\nFRANTIŠEK PALACKÝ: THE IDEA OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE\n\n31\n\nnature; they are therefore building something that is physically and morally impossible in the long run. By the principle of constitutionalism, nations are called upon everywhere to express their will in legislation and to see to its full effect; but centralism and dualism limits this to only civil and political rights and denies it arbitrarily with regard to the right of nations. The Slavs and Romanians are therefore supposed to subordinate themselves and subject themselves to the Germans and the Magyars; as citizens they are supposed to add their will to the laws, but as nations they are not supposed to have free will. Does this comport with the basic ideas and rights of constitutionalism? Is the person still free who is told: “You are supposed to be free, but not in the way in which you want but in the way I prescribe”? What entitles the Germans and Magyars to that sort of prescription? Who, being free, will be obliged to acknowledge foreign superiority under the law? If the Germans and Hungarians determine how many national rights the Slavs should get, how can anyone in Austria still speak of the equality of nations or of justice for all? […] But in the womb of the great and speculative German nation, one always comes across odd philosophers who, just as they are able to draw together all rationale and irrationality into methods and systems, also know how to show a priori that the principle of national equality is in itself sheer nonsense. The common origin of all humanity is said to be, just like Adam and Eve, a mere myth; as nature does not create two perfectly identical leaves, so she does not divide up her gifts to the nations in the same way, and when she granted some superior standing to one nation, that nation has the right to make use of it. And consequently the Germans, being by nature more talented, stronger and noble than the Slavs, are not meant at all to be placed on the same level as the Slavs. And such words are expressed not only in books and periodicals but also in German taverns. […] If, however, we look at the matter more closely, we cannot help suspecting that the Germans, who make noises about their natural superiority over us, only wish to drown out their own conscience, not being sufficiently, convinced themselves about their own claims. It would otherwise be impossible to explain why they would be so hesitant to enter a footrace with us on equal terms, if they were sure of their superiority and victory. But precisely for such a race to be just, we demand, rightfully, that the ancient wrongs end once and for all, and that the inequality, which is only a matter of fact and not of nature, not be exacerbated any more. We may, and we must, demand that the state, with the money that it gets from us, to the same extent as the Germans, does not support only German offices and higher education in our\n\n32\n\nMAKING OF THE MODERN STATE IN A MULTI-NATIONAL CONTEXT\n\ncountry; we must demand that Czech chairs at Prague University be established whenever the need arises, and that when some docent is to lecture not only on early German law but also on early Czech law, that is to say, not only on Eike von Repgow1 but also on Ondřej z Dubé2 and Viktorin ze Všehrd,3 the reply from Vienna not always be negative, and so forth. […] Even more backward is the pretence of the Magyars to rule in their country simply because they allegedly conquered it a thousand years ago. Were the rights they obtained by the sword not lost long ago also by the sword, because they were since then defeated a hundred times? Did they once get out of the Turkish yoke by their own power? Did they leave their last national battle at Világos as victors? But, as I have already said, one cannot carry on a discussion about right based on might, so I shall not waste any more words on the topic. Lastly, as a reason against the introduction of national equality, one gives the allegedly inevitable need of Austria not to give up the alliance with, and support of, the German Reich, which allegedly underpins it, and without which it would not just cease to be a Great Power (Grossmacht), but might perhaps even cease to exist. Indeed, Austria could not receive a stranger compliment than when it is said that the conditions for its existence come from outside it, not from within! And that is how the leading organ of public opinion speaks in the very heart of Austria, Vienna! I would tend to consider such words an insult to the magnificence of the Empire; and I cannot interpret them otherwise than to say that those who think and talk like that are far more concerned that the German nation rules than that Austria survives as a great power. It is all the same to us Slavs who rules in Germany or Italy, and we think that, if only Austria could ensure the satisfaction of all its nations with wise and just institutions and make it possible for us all to be proud of the name Austria, then she would have no reason to fear any other power in the world. […] Recently the Germans and the Magyars became accustomed to calling each and every conscious Slav who did not want to deny his nationality ‘PanSlavist’ or—as they say with foppish elegance in Hungary—‘Pan-Slav.’ Of course, if every national feeling, every natural Slav effort is Pan-Slavism, if 1\n\nEike von Repgow: medieval German administrator and compiler of the thirteenth-century Sachsenspiegel legal code. 2 Ondřej z Dubé: fourteenth-century Czech nobleman, judge and jurist of municipal law. 3 Viktorín ze Všehrd: Czech humanist lawyer, writer, and Dean of Prague University.\n\nFRANTIŠEK PALACKÝ: THE IDEA OF THE AUSTRIAN STATE\n\n33\n\nevery Slav who does not let himself be Germanized or Magyarized is a PanSlavist or a Pan-Slav, then there shall be millions of Pan-Slavists, and all Austria will become the promised land of Pan-Slavism—but a Pan-Slavism that not even we ourselves wish for. We unfortunately observe how in recent times the national egoism of the tribes ruling in Cisleithania and Transleithania appears increasingly open and ruthless. We read about the bargaining between German and Magyar politicians and about the dividing up of the administration of the Empire as if there were not even any Slavdom in Austria. We hear from both sides joyful words from the masses, which are prepared to rush into the supposed dualist paradise, and our hopes, no matter how justified, in the wise and continuous resistance of the Government to such developments might (God forbid) ultimately remain unfulfilled. In that case, we would have no choice but to say one last word: if the opposite of the idea of a modern Austrian state becomes the reality and if that heterogeneous and unique Empire does not grant the same justice to all, but instead chooses tyranny and the power of one over the other, if Slavs are proclaimed by law to be a subordinate race and, as we have already discussed, the subjects of a Government representing two other nations, then nature will assume its rights, and its inevitable resistance will change peace at home into unrest, will turn hope into desperation and will ultimately give rise to friction and struggles, the direction, extent and end of which cannot be foreseen. The day when dualism is proclaimed, which is an invevitable necessity of nature, will also be the day Pan-Slavism is born in its least desirable form, and its godparents will be the parents of dualism. What will follow can be imagined by every reader himself. We Slavs shall look to that day with sincere pain, but without fear. We existed before Austria, and we shall exist after her!

Alt-Ofen, Hungary) – 1893, Emmersdorf (near Klagenfurt, Austria)]: physician and political writer. He stemmed from a Moravian Jewish merchant family which had settled in Hungary at the turn of the nineteenth century. Fischof graduated from the Piarist gymnasium in Pest and then the department of medicine in Vienna (1836–1844), after which he worked in the maternity ward at a Viennese hospital. He emerged as one of the leaders of the revolutionary movement of 1848, making his name known with an incendiary speech to the crowd on 13 March. Later he became president of the Sicherheitsausschuss (Committee of public security), which functioned as a governing body during the revolutionary months in Vienna. While a supporter of the German liberal nationalist project, he was also a proponent of cooperation with the Hungarian revolutionaries and led a number of student delegations to the Hungarian Diet in Pozsony (Ger. Pressburg, Slo. Prešporok, present-day Bratislava). He was elected member of the Constituent Assembly (Reichstag) as a representative of a Viennese suburb, and became a key figure in the Kremsier (Cz. Kroměříž) Parliament, seeking to devise a liberal constitutional order for Austria. After the dissolution of the Parliament on 7 March, 1849, Fischhof was arrested and accused of high treason but was eventually acquitted. In the 1850s, forced out of politics, he built up a successful medical praxis. After the relaxation of neo-absolutism, he resumed political pamphleteering, criticizing the proposed reforms of the Schmerling administration in 1861 from a radical liberal perspective. Along these lines, he was a proponent of the Compromise with the Hungarians. After 1867 he urged further federalization, including the Czech Compromise,"
