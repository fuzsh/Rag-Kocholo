This document discusses how Bosnian sevdalinka music has been viewed through orientalist and national lenses. Sevdalinka songs are often about love and longing (sevdah) and have been characterized as melancholic by Western observers due to their use of minor scales, slow rhythms, and lack of harmony. However, native Bosnian listeners may interpret the emotional content of sevdalinka differently. The document also explores how concepts of melancholy were historically linked to theories of the four humors and how notions of oriental music being sad have been challenged by modern ethnomusicology.",
