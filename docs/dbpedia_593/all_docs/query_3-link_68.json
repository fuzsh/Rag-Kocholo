This document summarizes an article from The Slavonic and East European Review about Serbian historiography between 1882 and 1941 and its treatment of Serbia's relationship with Byzantium. The article argues that Serbian historians during this period portrayed Serbia's medieval past as both culturally associated with and culturally distinct from Byzantium. This dual framework was used both to construct a national mythology and to justify national and pan-national political projects. The article aims to analyze how historians fitted interpretations of Serbia-Byzantium relations into frameworks of nation-building and how those interpretations reinforced arguments for Serbian historical rights and cultural superiority.",
