        "text": "Bogumilska, is the name of the new collection of poems by the famous Montenegrin writer Miraš Martinović. These are verses inspired by the life and existence of the people of Bogumil, who disappeared from the map of the world, and whose presence in history can be read today mainly through tombstones. These inspiring, inspired and original verses were published by the publishing house Lena graphics design from Priština.\n\nMiraš Martinović is a writer of ancient themes and a writer of the past in whose books numerous civilizations and countries have been resurrected, from ancient Greece, Duklja, the kingdom of Illyria, to Bogumil.\n\nLet's also mention the latest news related to this writer: he recently received the Golden Dragon international literary award for his contribution to fantastic literature.\n\nYour new book of poems \"Bogumilske\" is dedicated to the Bogumils. When it comes to artists, Mak Dizdar, Desanka Maksimović, Miodrag Pavlović and other famous writers wrote about them. What prompted you to continue this poetic series?\n\n- Bogumili are an ongoing puzzle. Always and still with their mysteriousness, they intrigue both writers and scientists. A library of books has been written about them. Authors from the area of ​​the former Yugoslavia and from abroad. Among them was Doyen Refik Bešlagić, he dedicated his life and work to them, reached every stećak, every necropolis, photographed, mapped, made a list, studiously processed, gave a route for further studies. There are Alojzije Benac, Franjo Rački, Vladimir Dvorniković, Dimitrije Sergejevski, Dubravko Lovrenović, Aleksandar Soloviev, Marko Vego, Marian Wenzel, Konsatitn Jiřičk, Vaso Glušac, Milenko Karan, Amila Buturović and others.\n\nI haven't read everything, but I have read a lot. I can't help but mention Reža Trak's book The role of Bogomil dualism in the creation of medieval Bosnian identity. For years, wherever I went, whatever I came across, and it concerned Bogumil, I bought, read. Trak's book alone weighs five kilograms. An illustration of how much has been written. Among the writers, Mack Dizar was an ode to them with his book The Sleeping Stone, an important work of world literature. The tick is mesmerized. He wrote the famous foreword for the stećak exhibition in Paris in 1950, he saw them as a discovery, a \"stone poem\", dormant in the Bosnian mountains. With that exhibition, stećci became an important sign of civilization. Of the poets, you mentioned those who dealt with them, I would add Radovan Zogović, who sings about them in the Prince's Office. Those who continue to deal with Bogumili, will encounter more artists. As long as they are mysterious, they will intrigue, be a topic. After all, they are a big topic.\n\nThe existence of Bogumil is evidenced by their tombstones of exceptional beauty, while written documents are absent. What and what kind of sources did you rely on?\n\n- Hundreds of necropolises and thousands of tombstones in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dalmatia, Montenegro, and part of Serbia testify to their existence. And graves are the most reliable witnesses. On the plateaus, in the valleys, by the rivers, in the mountains, those stone markers stand in time, steadfastly and unfathomably. Those stone sleepers, \"on the earth on the noble\", as it says in the inscriptions on the stone, is a unique alphabet, and unique star and stone books. A map drawn on the ground and mirrored in the sky. Everything was passing, they were standing. Seen on moonlit nights, they give the impression of people rising from the ground, speaking with their silence. And the stone speaks louder, because it is the most silent. My book by Bogumilska is that speech and that silence. The speech of the souls that twist around the stones.\n\nLonely under the stars, in league with the stars. Even today, their souls hover over the areas where there are traces of their existence. Every suffering soul became a star. That's how I experienced them. I went around, trying to solve stone riddles with a song. I will mention some of those who led me to them and made it possible to meet stones, more permanent than life, more impressive than history, namely: friends from Mostar: Nino Gvozdić and Miro Raguž, and Mako's son Enver. With them, I once visited the necropolis in Boljuni, near Stolac (Raguž published a book about it, and with Miroslav Palamet a capital monograph, CONVERSATION WITH RADIMLJA). Radimilja, also near Stolac, is the most representative monument, a necropolis whose stećaks are decorated with the most luxurious figures and symbols, a superb range in stone sculpture. The Illyrian city of Daorson forms a torugao, three prominent points of civilization, it was destroyed in 43 BC, after which it was never rebuilt, and the contours of the city still exist today, the eastern gate is larger than the Mycenaean one. The city known as Bosnian Mycenae.\n\nPerhaps it is an opportunity to remind here that some scholars associate stećaks with the Illyrians, i.e. the symbols carved on them. Although the ones we still see today date back to the early Middle Ages... There are several theories, I wouldn't go deeper, science will have more work to do, so I believe it will solve this mystery in the right way. I deal with this topic as a writer. I used science as much as is necessary for literature. In history I looked for poetry, a state of mind, outside of history. In evaluating the significance of the Radimlje necropolis, I will call on Ota Bihalji - Merin to help, who wrote: \"I do not hesitate to call this place one of the most original sites of European artistic imagination.\"\n\nAnd as far as the document is concerned, in addition to the inscriptions on the stone, there are charters of the Baosan rulers, which are kept in Dubrovnik and other archives, which mention Bogumili and the Bosnian Church, which the Bosnian rulers favored. Authentic books have also been partially preserved: Batal's Gospel, Hval's Gospel, then Čajničko, Mostar, Vrutučko, a kind of testimony about their science. There are documents from the Roman Curia about the visit of its representatives to the areas, mostly Bosnian, where the Bogumili lived. Those charters are priceless testimony, followed by sales contracts containing the names of high-ranking representatives of the Bosnian Church, their titles, in the hierarchic order: grandfather (chief), then guest, old man, mechanic, then ordinary Christians.\n\nA whole history! Drama in people and on earth. Maybe because they got in the way of the course of official history, they wanted their own way, their own course, that's why they took so much care. That's why they ambush, strike, set fires...\n\nYou are known as a writer who brings history to life. I dare say, if there was no history, you would create it. In your books, you brought to life the Illyrians, the ancient Greeks and other peoples who once lived in this area. Was the revival of Bogumil a special challenge for you?\n\n- I was particularly interested in the Illyrians, among my books on the subject, the most important is Teuta, Queen of Illyria. It is an ancient people that inhabited the areas where we live, many artifacts testify to it: the remains of cities and temples, walls, mounds, roads overgrown with oblivion and grass, but still recognizable today. I studied their cults, gods, language that disappeared. Languages ​​are also disappearing, but the words of their language have been preserved through the language we speak. I was deeply interested in the Greeks, and I kept going. My new books found themes in even more distant civilizations and peoples, such as Sumerians, Babylonians, Hittites, Persians...\n\nThe deeper I go into history, the closer I get to myself and the time in which I live. My entire work leans on history. Sometimes, a seemingly unimportant detail becomes a song; a record in clay or on a stone, part of a record, a word surviving on a piece of vessel. History is not what has passed, it lives on in us, it is waking up, it is looking for the breath of life. Without such a relationship of history to us and us to history, it would be a dead sea. Petrified and motionless, and we filled with emptiness. All that I have written are the voices of history, the images of the ancient, the treasury that preserves everything, from which man reaches when he feels the need. History is in constant flux. It happens every moment. The theory of the French analysts is quite close to me.\n\nIn the context of the presence of Bogumil in the Balkans, a dominant word is associated, and that word is - persecution. Is there any other nation in today's age whose fate is similar to that of Bogumil?\n\n- Yes, persecution! You said it right. Their fate. They carried destiny. Such people are always suffering. Why so many? It is a question that arises again and again. Prgoni starts from the Bulgarian priest Bogumil, from the XNUMXth century, when the teaching begins, from his head. It spreads through Bulgaria, Macedonia, Dardania, and Raško, where cruel executions take place. The same fate follows them on the further journey. But,\n\nThe word cannot be burned, it lives even when it seems to be destroyed. The most beautiful flowers sprout from the ashes. What has passed, continues the journey through Duklja, to Bosnia, where they find refuge. Peaceful nest, science is accepted. But for a little while. The drama continues. There are many peoples throughout history who experienced a similar fate. Jews first of all, from the Babylonian slavery onwards. Bosnia at the end of the twentieth century... Before Bosnia and after Bosnia. Courage sleeps in man! And dares are repeated. Bogumislko teaching goes back before Bogumil, even three thousand years ago, to the Persian prophet and sage Zoroaster and the two principles, good and evil, on which rests the holy book of Zend Avesta, and later the complete Gnostic teaching.\n\nIn your song \"Grave\" there are lines: \"No one/Sznao/Whose/No one rests under/Stone... How do you perceive the monuments of Bogumil, which for centuries have majestically defied the Balkans?\"\n\n- Their lives are confirmed by their graves. On a not at all easy path, through the darkness of centuries, through the Balkan wilderness, the Bogumili left a bloody trail, and indelible stamps on the face of time in which they realized themselves as people, with crowns of thorns. Maybe it will forever remain a puzzle, where did such an old dare come from? I am reminded of the necropolis near the church in Nikšić, and the area of ​​Vilus and Broćanc. There are several of them in that area. My friend, Dr. Mišo Baćović, takes care of them and whispers with them, then the necropolis in the area of ​​Žabljak. When I visited Broćanac a few years ago, I saw a monolith stone in the middle of the valley, halfway between the Maidan where it was taken out and the necropolis where it was supposed to be placed. Why didn't he reach the place? The question just came up. \"Something overtook them. Running away or some other reason\", old teacher Radivoje Janičić told me. How many such witnesses are there on this earth?!\n\nThey defy magnificently, and speak eloquently about life, confirmed by suffering. Those who killed them did not know about God's: the victims do not die. Life, or better to say, logos (logos is indestructible!), written on stones, which they call: old cemeteries, Greek cemeteries, then Hungarian cemeteries, and giant ones (because of the size and weight of the stone megaliths), then Svatovska... and Hungarian cemeteries (remembering the time when when the Hungarians ruled Bosnia), Roman and Cifutian, plague cemeteries and marble... They live on earth and in memory. In Montenegro, not enough attention has been paid to these monuments. By the way, they have been written about, so far the most comprehensively, in the joint work of Predrag Malbaša and Tijana Samaržić. And Dr. Goran Komar registered bankrupts in areas outside of Montenegro, did significant work, published an extensive and capital book. Dimitrije Sergejevski wrote about the necropolis near Peter's Church in Nikšić. Aleksandar Berkuljan is seriously devoted to this topic. He recently published a paper in which he treated stećci in Crmnica, before that in some areas, and those stećci in Vuksanlekići near Podgorica.\n\nImposing buildings, various written and other documents testify to the existence of some peoples, and tombstones testify to Bogumili?\n\n- Only graves are left of that people! That is the sentence of the French writer Jacques Lacriard, who dedicated a chapter to them in his book Gnostics, entitled The Purity of the Mountains, referring to the Bosnian Bogumiles. For a long time, I was looking for the key to how to articulate what I carry inside me, and it concerns them. When I read this sentence, I had the key that opened time and suffering. Bogumilske is a book that differs from my previous ones.\n\nThey had huts, built of dry stone, stone, without decorations, which served for life, were temples... a threshing floor, where they threshed grain, had conversations, prayed to God. In the field or in the hut, it doesn't matter, as they said... Not palaces, not temples, not opulence and wealth. They despised it. Everything was destroyed, except for the graves. That terrible fact testifies to the suffering, the understanding of life, the science preached by their teachers, grandfathers and machinists. Something is preserved in the archives of the Roman Curia; theses of their science, recorded by the precise Franciscans sent by Rome. On the basis of field reports, he can find out a lot, and even guess.\n\nYou are a writer of the past, in each of your books there is an echo of the past. If you were to write about our present, what topic would you choose?\n\n- I tried, it didn't work. Everything that happens once, happens again. It is in human nature, it does not change. I see myself in ancient times. The themes of my books, although distant, have an echo in me, in my time.\n\nNo nation has ever completely disappeared, annihilated. The soldiers of Alexander the Great, after an unsuccessful campaign to the east, today have their descendants in Afghanistan. Who are the descendants of Bogumil?\n\n- Someone survived, and the survivors continue to live. We feel them in memory, in dreams, in thoughts. When it seems that something is dead, it comes alive, miraculously. They intrigue, we write about them, we visit their graves, read their names, look at the figures on the monuments. On the stone is written: All that life shone and death desired. I am currently reading the book Cult Symbols of the Illyrians by Dr. Aleksandar Stipčević, a world authority in Illyrianology. Symbols, starting from the same embryo, develop through peoples and civilizations, preserving the original, which makes them similar. Symbols are generally valid. The alphabet that feeds humanity.\n\nThe Bogumils were Christians, but much more liberal. Their church allowed women to wear priestly robes. How much did it help some Christian neighbors to attack them too?\n\n- Canon implies a set given. Humanity could not move forward without breaking the canon. In order to strengthen itself among the many religions, Christianity established a canon that was not to be tampered with. Whoever touches it has sinned. Pushing forward, carries the inevitable pops. Hence the persecution by the church and its institutions. Those who called themselves God-loving: Lovers of God, loved by God, dear to God, follow more liberal paths: they do not recognize earthly authorities, institutions, temples as places where they commune with God, clothes are not important to them. With more finesse, such as the non-recognition of images and icons, relics, etc. That is a question for those who are serious about them and the science they preached. I sang about graves, about stones, about words that survive pogroms, about the letter and the record, which is the principle or way of time, I wrote down what has disappeared. Collusion deleted. Bogumilske is a book of voices, crying and dying, of those who fell asleep under stones, and through us they wake up. Fire can compress memory. Memory is not flammable! She is always alive. And she wakes up occasionally, when the time calls for her.\n\nWhat kind of Gospel did the teachers of Bogumil preach? What was their attitude towards the government, towards earthly goods and wealth? A partial answer is given by Kozma the Presbyter, whom you quote at the beginning of the book...\n\n- Of the canonical gospels, the closest to them is the Gospel of John, that eternally living logos, which shines in people and in the sky, and the logos is the sun of all suns... They rely on John. St. Paul is also close to them, who says: \"For it is necessary that there should be division among you, so that it may be shown who are steadfast among you\" (Corinthians 11, 19). Saint Augustine thinks and writes in the same spirit: \"If there were no heretics, the church would fall asleep on the Holy Scriptures as on a pillow: heresies force it to wake up.\" The martyrs were killed, burned, disabled in various ways, books and people were burned. Some ancient ones, like those accidentally found in Egypt in Nag Kamada, among them: the Gospel according to Thomas, the Gospel according to Philip, the Gospel according to Mary Magdalene, various epistles and other writings. That discovery, according to the opinion of scientists, among them great church authorities, enriched Christian science and philosophy, the entire human thought. Those who open the way for humanity cannot be heresy, but they can be a hindrance to the earthly authorities, which are temporary.\n\nIn the song \"Hoće\" you say: \"Those from the east/ And those from the west/ Popes and emperors/ Bonificius and Urbani/ Bishops and vicars/ They shout at the top of their voices/ That heresy should be burned/\". Why did Eastern and Western Christians try to destroy Bogumila?\n\n- They bothered both Western and Eastern Christianity, for the reasons I mentioned. They deviated. Hence freaks, strays, evil heretics, cursed baboons, God's weed... Various derogatory names. Propaganda, as it is today. That there are no opposites. If there are any, they should be silenced, silenced, destroyed. It has happened throughout history. Man does not change, but history, an unstoppable river. It is repeated, it is not said by chance. Who can guarantee that the fate of Bogumil will not be repeated in the future? There is evil in man, as well as good."
