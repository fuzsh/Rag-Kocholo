        "text": "FLINT — Win or lose, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her daughter Chelsea will continue to pursue help for the city of Flint as it deals with the ongoing public health crisis caused by water that’s been contaminated with lead.\n\n“This is personal to us and our commitment to Flint continues,” Chelsea Clinton told journalists Friday after being briefed on the city’s status by Mayor Karen Weaver and faith leaders in the community.\n\nIf her mother becomes president of the United States, Chelsea Clinton said federal authorities will be directed to have an ongoing dialogue on the needs in the city. That federal support could come in the form of early childhood development programs, funding for nurses and social workers in public schools and continuing to do job training for youths in the city.\n\n“We always have to start by listening,” she said during a meeting at the Greater Holy Temple in Flint. “I don’t think we know what the answer is next year or in the next decade. But I know my mother will direct the federal government to have an ongoing dialogue so there can be a robust and meaningful response.”\n\n►Related: We're hosting a Trump-Clinton debate-watching party!\n\nChelsea Clinton’s briefing in Flint was one of four stops she made in the last two days in Michigan. She held a women’s event in Grand Rapids and spoke to students at Michigan State University on Thursday, followed by Friday's meeting in Flint and a stop at a phone bank at a UAW Hall in the city that’s been dealing with a water crisis for more than two years.\n\nThe visit comes as the polls in Michigan are tightening with Hillary Clinton maintaining a slim lead over Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. A poll done last week by EPIC-MRA for the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV (Channel 7) showed Clinton with a 3 percentage point lead over Trump. The stop also follows a visit to Flint last week by Trump, who toured the now-dormant Flint water treatment plant and spoke briefly at a church in the city.\n\nTrump said that what happened to Flint was horrible and that “I will fix it.” But he didn’t offer specific solutions.\n\nScott Hagerstrom, director of Trump’s campaign efforts in Michigan, didn’t talk about the Flint visit, but asked: “After Hillary let slip at a Wall Street fund-raiser earlier this month that she sees half of this country's voters — including veterans, police officers, firefighters and other hard-working Americans — as either 'deplorable' or 'irredeemable,' Michiganders have one question for Chelsea Clinton on her visit here: Does she agree with Hillary’s view of them?”\n\nChelsea Clinton, who has now visited Flint three times, said she had a view of the situation in the city and how Congress has been ignoring the need for significant investment in the city. While the Senate passed a sweeping Water Resources bill that included $100 million for Flint, Republican leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives said Thursday that they will pay for relief efforts in flood-ravaged Louisiana, but don’t plan to include funding for Flint in budget bills.\n\n“Are we really in the business in this country of determining which of our children deserve emergency relief when there is an emergency,” she said. “It is ludicrous that anyone could look (U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee) or the mayor (of Flint) in the eye and say this is not urgent simply because it’s been going on for 2 years. This is moral urgency at its most painful.”\n\nKildee added that Democrats will not support any federal budget bill that does not include funding for Flint and questioned why Republicans were treating Flint residents differently from people in other communities in need.\n\n“I find it ironic that one would argue that a community that is still underwater would say their need is more immediate when people in Flint haven’t been able to drink their water for two years,” he said. “Two years for God’s sake. It’s a moral outrage.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Sander Levin, D-Royal Oak, added, “It’s unconscionable that the residents of Flint, who are suffering from a man-made disaster, are still waiting for relief from the federal government. We have a duty to our citizens throughout the country — from Louisiana to Flint — to provide assistance when disaster strikes.”\n\nAnd Weaver said, \"We are angered, we’re outraged because it doesn’t make any sense. Flint is a metaphor for other cities across the state and country.\"\n\nHillary Clinton first mentioned the Flint water crisis in early January and followed up with comments on talk radio and in a Democratic debate. She left the campaign trail before the New Hampshire primary to visit the city in February and called for one of the Democratic debates to be held in the city. She dispatched two aides to the city to find out more about the problem and helped secure a $500,000 donation from the Pritzker Foundation to be used to help employ people in Flint between the ages of 16-20.\n\nFlint Mayor Karen Weaver said 374 applicants were processed with the foundation grant, 83 people have completed pre-employment training and 78 youths have been placed in paid employment.\n\nAnd while the Clinton Foundation has not donated to the City of Flint, Chelsea Clinton said the family has personally donated to the fund set up by Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who first sounded the alarm about lead poisoning of children in Flint.\n\nThe city’s water system became contaminated when, under the control of a state-appointed emergency manager, the city decided to save money by switching its water supply from the Detroit Water and Sewerage system, which draws its water from Lake Huron, to the Flint River. The improperly treated river water was more corrosive and caused pipes to leach lead into the water that flowed into city homes and businesses. Nine people — one Flint employee and eight state employees — have been charged criminally for their roles in the crisis. The state also has sued two businesses in civil court for damages caused by the contamination.\n\nHillary Clinton was last in Michigan on Aug. 11 and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, marched in the Labor Day parade in Detroit. Trump has been to Michigan four times since the Republican National Convention, with visits to Detroit, Dimondale and Flint.\n\nContact Kathleen Gray: kgray99@freepress.com.
