And, as a mom of three Chelsea is committed to doing everything she can to leave the world a better place for future generations to come.\n\nAs Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation, Chelsea Clinton works alongside the Foundation's leadership and partners to help create economic opportunity, improve public health, and inspire civic engagement and service across the United States and around the world.

She also serves on the boards of the Clinton Health Access Initiative and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.\n\nIn addition to her Foundation work, Ms. Clinton also teaches at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health and has written several books for young readers, including the New York Times bestsellers She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World and She Persisted Around the World, as well as Start Now! You Can Make a Difference; Don't Let Them Disappear; and It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going. She is also the co-author of The Book of Gutsy Women and Grandma's Gardens with her mom Hillary Clinton and of Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why? with Devi Sridhar.\n\nMs. Clinton holds a Bachelor of Arts from Stanford, a Master of Public Health from Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, and both a Master of Philosophy and a Doctorate in international relations from Oxford University.
