        "text": "The area around Wilbur Hall looked like an armed camp on Friday morning as Stanford University prepared for the arrival of Chelsea Clinton. The last time I saw so many policemen on campus was a frightening night in 1969 when heavily armed units were summoned to end the violent takeover of an administration building by student protesters. As policemen in riot gear moved into Encina Hall that night, the university lost its innocence. The sunny, sandstone campus was no longer a magical world of learning and jasmine-scented breezes, but a battleground in the American civil conflict over the Vietnam War.\n\nThe atmosphere on Friday could not have been more different, with red and white balloons and banners welcoming freshmen to campus and a warm September sun casting a languid spell. Yet the arrival of Ms. Clinton and her parents seemed to me to signal another challenging juncture for Stanford, and more broadly for the country. Can Stanford, the media and the country find a reasonable balance point in their handling of the college education of the daughter of the President of the United States?\n\nAll the talk out here about treating Chelsea Clinton like any other Stanford freshman is well intentioned but unrealistic. If that is the goal of the White House and the university, it will never be achieved. She is not just another celebrated Stanford student like Tiger Woods, or the daughter of a movie star or powerful corporate executive. Her fame flows from the direct and immediate connection to the political leader of the country and the Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful military force.\n\nThe dislocation and security that came with her arrival made the difference clear. Anyone can understand the Clintons' desire to see their daughter off to college, and Stanford was swarming on Friday with cars from dozens of states stuffed with parents, freshmen and stacks of duffel bags, blankets, stereos and computers. But when Chelsea Clinton checked into my old freshman dorm, the parking lots and playing fields around Wilbur Hall looked like the venue for a summit of world leaders.\n\nIt might have been a favor to everyone if President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton had stayed home. That certainly would have allowed their daughter to make a more modest entrance, attended perhaps by a handful of Secret Service agents rather than arriving in a Presidential motorcade and trailed by hundreds of reporters and cameramen drawn more by her father than by her. Sharing arrival day with the President and First Lady was a thrill for many students and their parents, but if the long-term goal is to discourage a preoccupation with Chelsea Clinton, the White House should have considered a less flamboyant way of getting her to school.\n\nIf Ms. Clinton's presence is not to be a running spectacle, reporters, camera crews, tourists and the rest of the country will have to contain their natural curiosity about her life at Stanford. Her fellow students will probably notice her less than outsiders because she will blend into their community. Nevertheless, given the strong entrepreneurial spirit at Stanford, the university that made Silicon Valley possible, some unkind students may see profit in chronicling her undergraduate days.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
