Although she's one of the most famous daughters in our country, she mostly lived out of the spotlight—until she stepped up to stump for her mother, Hillary Clinton, during the Secretary of State's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Even when Chelsea married Marc Mezvinsky in 2010, and she released all those intimate family photos to the press, I never felt like I actually knew anything about her. So when I heard she's decided to be a correspondent for NBC's Rock Center with Brian Williams, I watched her debut—last night—with great interest.\n\nChelsea, 31, is doing \"Making a Difference\" segments for the network and her first one brought her to her home state of Arkansas. While she interviewed Annette Dove from Pine Bluff, who spent her life savings establishing the non-profit TOPPS to help the neediest children in her community, I felt like I got to see a lot about the one-time First Daughter. Here are a few things I learned…\n\n__1. She's as well-spoken as I thought she'd be.__Let's just say it's obvious she didn't spend her years at Stanford and Oxford strictly hitting keggers.\n\n2. She has great hair. To all the meanies who criticized her appearance when she was in an awkward phase at 13, look at that hair. Pretty fabulous.\n\n3. She's very polite. Chelsea must have the complete collection of Miss Manners books. It was all, \"Yes, maam,\" \"No, maam\" and \"Thank you.\"\n\n4. She's learning to cook. When Ms. Dove asked Chelsea to help during a cooking class with the kids, she playfully joked that Hillary and Bill's daughter clearly didn't know much about cooking. Chelsea replied that she's currently in the process of learning and recently made Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n5. She was inspired by her grandmother. Chelsea said that her decision to start living a more public life was inspired by her grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, who passed away in November, saying: \"She recently had been cajoling me and challenging me to do more with my life, to lead a more of purposely public life, that being Chelsea Clinton had happened to me and that I had a responsibility to do something with that asset and opportunity.\"__\n\nVisit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\nWhat did you think of Chelsea Clinton's Rock Center debut?
