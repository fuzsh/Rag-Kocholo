        "text": "During casual dinners in New York, Chelsea Clinton began talking to friends about something she had been mulling: She wanted to stop pretending to be someone other than Chelsea Clinton.\n\nWhat an assertion from someone who had lived most of her 31 years removed from the spotlight, despite the high profile of both parents — one a former president, the other the secretary of state.\n\nYes, Chelsea had been spotted through the years, as she grew from a gangly teenager into a stylishly dressed woman.\n\nStill, for the most part, she seemed determined to keep her private life private.\n\nThis time, however, talk addressed the notion that, if she were to face the downside of being the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, under constant scrutiny, why not also take advantage of the upside?\n\nThus, in the past 12 months, she has joined the board of Barry Diller’s Internet media holding company, IAC/InterActiveCorp; given speeches at fundraisers for organizations such as amfAR; taken an increasingly public role with the Clinton Global Initiative; presented an award to her mother at Diane von Furstenberg’s International Women’s Day event; and hosted her father’s 65th birthday at a Hollywood benefit for the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAnd, in her most high-profile move, she has taken a job with NBC News as a special correspondent, contributing to the network’s “Making a Difference” franchise.\n\nClinton will make her first appearance on Monday on the prime-time newsmagazine Rock Center With Brian Williams, with a segment she developed on a nonprofit organization in Pine Bluff, Ark.\n\nShe initiated the career move, having her advisers arrange interviews with network executives and at one point working with the powerful Creative Artists Agency.\n\n“I hope to make a positive, productive contribution, as cheesy as that may sound,” Clinton wrote recently by email. “For most of my life, I deliberately led a private life in the public eye.”\n\nBut, after campaigning for her mother’s presidential bid in 2008, Clinton realized she liked speaking publicly on issues about which she has strong feelings.\n\nHer grandmother Dorothy Rodham gave her some advice.\n\n“She told me being Chelsea Clinton had happened to me, and, outside of my advocacy work and campaigning for my mom, I wasn’t doing enough in the world.”\n\nThose conversations continued for a couple of years, until Rodham died in November.\n\n“I took what she said seriously — that I had led an inadvertently public life for a long time and maybe it was time to start leading a purposefully public life.”\n\nAs unlikely as it might seem, those who watched her on her mother’s campaign are not surprised. They described her as someone who, in a matter of weeks, went from speaking to a dozen people at a coffee shop to fielding questions from crowds of thousands.\n\n“People were interested in coming to hear and see her because they watched her grow up, and then they’d realize how substantive she was,” said Howard Wolfson, a senior strategist on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.\n\nThat Chelsea Clinton even existed might have come as a surprise to many voters 20 years ago. During Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, 12-year-old Chelsea was so shielded from routine photo ops that polls showed many voters lacking the knowledge that the Clintons had a child. The family promptly sat down for a spread in People magazine.\n\nSix years later, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Clinton was photographed walking hand in hand with her parents, the dutiful teenager keeping her family together as they strode sadly across the White House lawn.\n\n“The No.?1 thing Bill and Hillary accomplished is raising Chelsea Clinton,” said James Steyer of Common Sense Media, who has stayed close with Chelsea Clinton since she was his student at Stanford University.\n\nIn public, she has always seemed like her mother — dutiful and restrained, as if politics were the high price to pay for public service. In private, friends say, Clinton is much more Bill Clinton’s daughter — argumentative and warm, with a biting sense of humor and a knack for remembering arcane facts.\n\nAlthough Clinton is undeniably close to her father, she has also forged her own way on some crucial issues, particularly gay marriage.\n\nIn May, Clinton was at a New York nightclub to attend a benefit for a gay-rights group.\n\n“I certainly believe that all of my friends .?.?. should have the right to marry their best friends,” Clinton told the crowd.\n\nWhen her father was president, he signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act, saying that, although he opposed discrimination, he did not support same-sex marriages. But recently he shifted, announcing in May that he supported passage of a gay-marriage bill then being debated by the New York Legislature.\n\nPart of the fascination with Chelsea Clinton’s life is that, unlike other famous offspring, she has never been photographed stumbling out of a club. It’s not that she has avoided such situations; it’s just not something she would do, said friend Nicole Davison Fox.\n\n“If you knew us in high school, you would’ve thought we were so nerdy,” she said.\n\nThe two met in an eighth-grade science class at Sidwell Friends School. Fox was Clinton’s matron of honor at her wedding to Marc Mezvinsky in the summer of 2010.\n\nMezvinsky, a former Goldman Sachs banker, will soon start a hedge fund with a friend. Their apartment, shared with a miniature Yorkshire terrier, is said to be overflowing with books.\n\n“We live in a culture of gossip and entertainment, and Chelsea Clinton seems to be neither a great gossip nor a great entertainer,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who worked for Bill Clinton.\n\n“She’s a very serious person.”"
