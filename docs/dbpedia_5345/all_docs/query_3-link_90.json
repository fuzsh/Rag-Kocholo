During an interview last year, the former president also spoke about his own hopes for having children in his future: \"My goal is to live to be a grandfather. The rest of it's out of my hands.\"\n\nChelsea played down that parental pressure until she revealed in an interview last fall with Glamour magazine that she and her husband hoped to start adding to their family.\n\n“We sat down and said, 'Here's what we want to do.' The first thing on the list was simple: We want, God willing, to start a family. So we decided we were going to make 2014 the Year of the Baby,\" Clinton told the magazine.\n\nShe also told the magazine interviewer to \"please call my mother and tell her that. She asks us about it every single day.\"\n\nHillary Clinton has loosely suggested she would wait to make any announcement about her political plans, including a run for the White House, until after her daughter gave birth.\n\nThe birth of her first child has capped a year of milestones for the former first daughter. In May, she received her doctorate degree in international relations from Oxford University. She also took a more public role with her family’s Clinton Foundation, where she serves as vice chair and played an active role in developing policies addressing childhood obesity and HIV/AIDS.\n\nLast month, Bill Clinton received some humorous advice about becoming a grandparent from another former president, who had his first grandchild a year ago. During a joint appearance in Washington to launch the Presidential Leadership Scholars program, George W. Bush told his White House successor to \"be prepared to fall completely in love again.\"\n\nBut he also gave him a caveat: “Get ready also to be, like, the lowest person in the pecking order in your family.”\n\nThis updated story was originally published Sept. 27 at 7:20 a.m. ET."
