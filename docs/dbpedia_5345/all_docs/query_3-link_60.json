        "text": "WASHINGTON | Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton say they are \"blessed, grateful, and so happy\" to become grandparents.\n\nTheir daughter, Chelsea, gave birth Friday night to her first child, Charlotte.\n\nChelsea Clinton announced the news on Twitter and Facebook early Saturday, saying she and husband Marc Mezvinsky are \"full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.\"\n\n\"Chelsea is well and glowing. Marc is bursting with pride. Charlotte's life is off to a good start,\" the former president and first lady said in the statement on Saturday.\n\nThe Mezvinskys live in New York City, but the family did not say where the child was born or provide additional details on the birth.\n\nThe news comes as Hillary Clinton deliberates whether to run for the White House in 2016. She is the leading Democratic contender to succeed President Barack Obama, her 2008 campaign rival, and has said she expects to make a decision around the beginning of next year.\n\nThe baby has been eagerly anticipated as Hillary Clinton considers her political future. She has called the prospect of becoming a grandmother her \"most exciting title yet.\" She even has picked out the first book she intends to read to her grandchild, the classic \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nShe has said she didn't want to make any decisions about another campaign until the baby's arrival, pointing to her interest in enjoying becoming a grandmother for the first time.\n\nBill Clinton, who canceled a fundraising visit Saturday to Denver for Democrats running for the Senate and governor, has been eager to become a grandfather.\n\nThe 34-year-old Chelsea Clinton said in an interview with Glamour magazine last year that she and her husband had hoped to make 2014 \"the year of the baby.\" She announced her pregnancy in April at the end of a forum in New York on female empowerment.\n\n\"I just hope I will be as good a mom to my child and, hopefully, children as my mom was to me,\" she said at the time.\n\nThe new parents, who married in 2010, were friends as teenagers in Washington and both attended Stanford. Mezvinsky is a hedge fund manager and the son of former Reps. Majorie Margolies of Pennsylvania and Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa, longtime friends of the Clintons."
