        "text": "Chelsea Clinton's husband is somewhat of a mysterious figure, even though Clinton has spent her entire life in the spotlight.\n\nWhen Clinton was born, her father, Bill Clinton, was already the governor of Arkansas. A presidential child who grew up to be gorgeous in front of America's eyes, Clinton has been known as a governor's daughter, the daughter of the POTUS, the daughter of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as a successful woman in her own right. That said, while we see a lot of Clinton in the news, she does her best to keep her home life under wraps. We can't blame her for wanting to keep her private life to herself as much as it is possible; however, that doesn't stop us from wishing we knew more about Clinton and her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, have been together for more than a decade. However, the public doesn't know very much about Mezvinsky. So, who is the enigmatic figure who swept Clinton off her feet? What does he do for work? And, more importantly, what's his relationship with Clinton like? Here's the truth about Chelsea Clinton's husband, Marc Mezvinsky.\n\nChelsea Clinton's husband has a huge family, so we can only imagine the holiday gatherings these two have!\n\nMarc Mezvinsky comes from quite a large family and is one of 11 children, as reported by Vogue. Not all of his siblings are biological, though. As noted by her profile on the U.S. House of Representatives website, in 1970, Marjorie Margolies — Mezvinsky's mother — became the first single woman in the U.S. to adopt a child from another country when she adopted a daughter from Korea. A few years later, she adopted another daughter from Vietnam. Margolies was a single mother of two children when she first met Edward Mezvinsky, who welcomed Margolies' daughters into the family when they got married. Together, Margolies and Mezvinsky raised Margolies' two children, Mezvinsky's four children from a previous marriage, two biological sons (including Marc Mezvinsky), as well as three sons the couple adopted together from Vietnam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the 11 children they raised, Mezvinsky's parents also sponsored a number of refugee families, providing for an estimated total of 25 children (via the U.S. House of Representatives website).\n\nChelsea Clinton's husband remains cloaked in mystery, giving the public ample opportunity to create imaginary backstories for him in their minds.\n\nPerhaps in part because Marc Mezvinsky doesn't reveal a lot of personal information about himself, some rumors have swirled about him in an effort to fill in the blanks. One of the most widely spread rumors about Clinton's husband is that Mezvinsky is a member of the Soros family — specifically that he is the nephew of billionaire and philanthropist George Soros. As noted by Snopes, this rumor can be traced back to actor Scott Baio, who claimed on Facebook in 2016 that he had discovered that Mezvinsky is secretly related to Soros.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaio provided no evidence to back up the theory, but the rumor still took on a life of its own. In reality, however, Soros only has one brother, the late Paul Soros. Paul Soros had two children, Peter Soros and Jeffrey Soros. Additionally, Baio claimed that Mezvinsky and Clinton were married at the Soros mansion, which is also false.\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband have quite a lot in common. Both of them come from political families, for example. While Marc Mezvinsky's family isn't quite as well known as the Clinton family, Mezvinsky, like his wife, grew up with two highly driven and successful parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to his dad's official biography at the United States Congress, Clinton's father-in-law, Edward Mezvinsky, is an attorney who served as a member of the Iowa State House of Representatives from 1969 to 1970 before serving in Congress from 1973 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, he was the U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human rights. The elder Mezvinsky also served as Democratic Party State Chairman of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1986.\n\nMezvinsky's mother, Marjorie Margolies, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995. Her political career came to an end following a loss of support after she controversially backed Bill Clinton on a budget vote after previously opposing the measure. Prior to her political career, Margolies was a well-known television journalist who won five Emmy Awards over the course of her career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband go way back, meeting before the former first daughter's stunning transformation.\n\nAs noted by Us Weekly, Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky first met in 1993 in Hilton Head, South Carolina, at a Democratic political retreat. While they didn't begin dating at that time, they did start a friendship that would eventually lead to romance. Their friendship continued for years, even as they went their separate ways and dated other people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton and Mezvinsky had been friends for decades before they finally began to date. For a while it looked like the relationship might never come about, as Clinton was in a serious relationship with writer Ian Klaus for four years. After their 2005 breakup, though, the timing finally seemed to work out between Clinton and Mezvinsky and they started dating that same year, much to the delight of their loved ones.\"We were always rooting for them to get together,\" one of Clinton's friends revealed to Vogue.\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband ended up both attending Stanford, where Marc Mezvinsky — the older of the two — even gave Clinton a tour before she enrolled at the institution.\n\nWhile the pair were still just friends when Clinton enrolled as a student, it didn't take long for rumors alleging there was more going on between Clinton and Mezvinsky to begin circulating. A source even told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 1997 that Clinton chose to attend the school \"because she's crazy about Marc Mezvinsky and he's a freshman there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMezvinsky's mother denied the rumors that there was anything more between her son and the young Clinton other than an enduring friendship. She did, however, tell the Philadelphia Inquirer that the friendship was incredibly important to her son. She added that he even refused to even talk about their friendship as part of his admissions essay for Stanford because he didn't want to \"exploit the relationship under any circumstances.\" While there are plenty of presidential children who have gotten into weird relationships, it seems Clinton and Mezvinsky's relationship had a solid, somewhat normal start.\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband are the ultimate power couple, as the former first kid and Marc Mezvinsky both have wildly successful careers.\n\nPer her bio at Columbia's Mailman School of Health, Clinton is an adjunct professor at the institution, has authored several books, is the Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation, and sits on multiple boards. For his part, Mezvinsky is an investment banker. As noted by The North American Pembrokian, his first job in the industry was at Goldman Sachs' Investment Management Division in 2002. After several years working at various departments at the company, he left Goldman Sachs and became a partner at 3G Capital, running its global macro portfolio. In 2011, Mezvinsky co-founded his own hedge fund, Eaglevale Partners, which shut down in 2017. Per the Daily Mail, he joined private equity firm TPG in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMezvinsky is also co-author of E-Finance North America: Strategic and Statistical Analysis of Online Financial Services, which was published in 2000.\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, broke with tradition when they announced their engagement to their friends and their family.\n\nInstead of sending out a formal announcement or placing a notice in a newspaper as you might expect from two young people from prominent political families, Clinton and Mezvinsky kept things low-key (and much more modern) by emailing their loved ones the happy news. The New York Times noted that Mezvinsky and Clinton sent out a mass message in November 2009 in which they wished recipients a belated happy Thanksgiving and went on to reveal the news of their upcoming marriage — which they announced was to be held the following summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement also put to rest rumors that had been circulating claiming that the couple had eloped the previous summer, which the couple denied in their engagement email. Sure, mass emails can be annoying — but at least this one was informative!\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky tied the knot in a lavish ceremony, much like you might expect of two kids from wealthy families.\n\nToday estimated at the time that the the event cost somewhere between $2 million and $5 million, including $11,000 for a gluten-free cake, $500,000 for flowers, and $600,000 for air-conditioned tents with glass walls. A no-fly zone was enforced over Rhinebeck by the Federal Aviation Administration on the day of the wedding. Wedding planner Claudia Hanlin told the outlet that the affair was planned \"to be very understated, elegant, but befitting a royal wedding for the U.S.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs noted by the New Jersey Herald, among the hundreds of guests were Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Vera Wang, and Madeleine Albright. While the venue was closed to the public, fans reportedly turned out in droves in the hopes of seeing a celebrity or catching a glimpse of the bride and groom. As noted by Stanford's The Dish, they tied the knot in Rhineback, New York at Astor Courts. Clinton wore a Vera Wang gown while Mezvinsky wore a Burberry suit.\n\nChelsea Clinton's husband gets along with his father-in-law quite well, unlike other people who have a less-than-positive relationship with their in-laws.\n\nAfter Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky got engaged, People reported that the one-time president approved of the man his only child had decided to marry. A source told the outlet that the former president \"adores\" Mezvinsky and views him as the son that he never had. While Bill Clinton never got to know his own father, who died before he was born, the source said that he was cultivating the sort of father-son relationship with Mevsinsky that he had never had the chance to experience himself and that it was a \"comfortable\" and \"nurturing\" relationship. The young couple reportedly spent quite a bit of time with Clinton's father during their engagement, going out to dinner or to the movies together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former president also spoke highly of Mezvinsky himself, referring to him as \"a great human being.\" Politics aside, it's heartwarming to see the former president dote on his son-in-law.\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, have three beautiful children together: Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, and Jasper Clinton Mezvinsky. While Clinton and Mezvinsky aren't the type to fill social media with pics of their home life, Clinton has said that her husband is a doting father who loves spending time with their children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Lohud following the birth of Charlotte, Clinton revealed that Mezvinsky took paternity leave from his job so that he could spend time with their newborn. Clinton described her husband as \"an engaged and happy father,\" adding, \"I didn't know I could love my husband any more until he became Charlotte's dad.\"\n\nIt seems Clinton and Mezvinsky are raising their children to be staunch feminists, as Clinton revealed to Parents that they believe it's important for their kids to be exposed to stories where girls \"are determined, resilient, persisting, and persevering.\" Clinton also told the outlet that she and her husband make sure that their kids \"see their mother and father involved in chores around the house and caring for them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky are very careful about controlling their public image and keeping their private life under wraps. This has left tabloids to speculate about the true nature of their relationship and rumored strange things about Clinton and Mezvinsky's marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after the couple married, buzz about an impending divorce began to circulate. In 2011, just a few months after Clinton and Mezvinsky tied the knot, CBS 2 reported that many were claiming the marriage was already on the rocks and that Clinton was contemplating getting an annulment.\n\nOf course, we know now that there was little — if any — truth to the rumors, as Clinton and Mezvinsky are still going strong. \"None of it was true,\" a representative told Vogue in 2012, adding that the rumor mill made Clinton realize that she needed to open up to the press more in order to \"demystify\" herself and put to rest any untold truth about her life and marriage.\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband have one not-so-pleasant thing in common: both have faced major family scandals involving the family patriarch.\n\nIn Clinton's case, the scandal in question was the infamous Clinton-Lewinsky scandal during her father's presidency. However, her husband's familial drama was a bit different than her own. As noted by the Associated Press, Marc Mezvinsky's father, Edward Mezvinsky, found himself embroiled in controversy in the early 2000s after he embezzled more than $10 million. In 2001, he pled guilty to 31 counts of bank, mail, and wire fraud, and ended up serving less than five years of his 80 month sentence. In 2016, records obtained by Politico revealed that, prior to his formal indictment, Edward Mezvinsky and his wife pleaded with then-president Bill Clinton for a pardon which ultimately wasn't granted, although it's unclear if Clinton ever saw the letters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile these scandals were undoubtedly difficult for Clinton and Mezvinsky, some have speculated that their respective familial hardships drew the two long-time friends even closer together. As one observer told the New York Post, \"They both grew up with those dark clouds that hung over them.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton and her husband can afford to live in some seriously comfortable digs.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Marc Mezvinsky is worth an estimated $15 million, while Clinton is thought to be worth a cool $25 million. Considering the jaw-dropping amount of money Clinton and her husband make, it should come as no surprise that they have an astonishing home. As noted by the Daily News, Mezvinsky and Clinton scored a $10 million Manhattan apartment overlooking Madison Square Park in 2013. Obviously, you can add Clinton's name to the list of presidential kids who live insanely lavish lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMezvinsky and Clinton's gorgeous home is one of the longest in NYC and is as long as an entire city block. The residence is one that anyone who grew up in the palatial White House would feel at home in. Per NY Nesting, Clinton and Mezvinsky's apartment is in a former office building and boasts a whopping four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, and is nearly 5,000 square feet large. Other features include floor-to-ceiling windows, a chef's kitchen, media room, and a master bath made of Italian marble.\n\nWhile Chelsea Clinton's husband keeps a much lower profile than his wife, Marc Mezvinsky has made it clear in the interviews he's granted in the past just how much he loves and admires the former first daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 2012 Vogue interview alongside his wife, Mezvinsky briefly spoke to the outlet about his marriage to Clinton. Mezvinsky compared his wife to Hillary Clinton, saying that, like her former presidential hopeful mother, his wife is an eloquent speaker who \"speaks in fully formed paragraphs,\" which he said is a gift that \"defies logic.\" Mezvinsky added that he and his wife are quite different, but that their differences don't make them incompatible. Instead, Mezvinsky believes he and Clinton's differences help them to balance each other out.\n\n\"She's very much the yin to my yang,\" Mezvinsky told Vogue, explaining that, while he \"can exist in a cloud\" and \"walk into parking meters,\" Clinton is the exact opposite. Mezvinsky continued, joking that his wife is always there to point out those pesky parking meters before he walks into them. Hey, opposites attract, right? These two certainly seem to prove it.\n\nAdvertisement"
