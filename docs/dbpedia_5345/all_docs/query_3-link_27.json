        "text": "When it comes to living life to the fullest, Clinton Foundation Vice Chair and former first daughter Chelsea Clinton turns to her family for words of wisdom.\n\n“One of [my grandma's] biggest adages is that life's not about what happens to you, it's about what you do with what happens to you,” she told me during a break in the action at the 9th annual Clinton Global Initiative University meeting this weekend.\n\nIt’s advice like this -- as well as her parents’ mantra that it’s always better to try, even if you don’t succeed -- that has led Clinton to where she is today.\n\n“I think about those a lot, and I try to challenge myself against those standards really everyday, professionally and also personally.”\n\nAnd there’s no doubt Clinton is making waves.\n\nThis year’s CGI U meeting, where Clinton presided as host alongside her father President Clinton, convened more than 1,200 students at UC Berkeley to solve some of the world’s biggest issues. The meeting focused on five key areas -- education, environment and climate change, peace and human rights, poverty alleviation, and public health -- that were chosen based “around issues that students are already inspired by and engaged in [...] and where they want to be able to deepen their expertise or their functional knowledge or their networks,” Clinton said.\n\nFor Clinton, who was inspired by renowned anthropologist and physician Paul Farmer during her years at Stanford, working with millennials to solve some of these issues plays an important role. CGI U, after all, is modeled after the Clinton Global Initiative, which gathers world leaders to solve global challenges.\n\n“I think young people are clearly demonstrating their leadership in their own right and to all of us.”\n\nSome of the initiatives (aka “Commitments to Action”) CGI U has seen include developing emotional wellness apps on college campuses, manufacturing wheelchairs for developing countries, and building e-learning applications for mobile devices.\n\nClinton also looks to her father, who founded CGI U, as a source of inspiration.\n\n“He has really long believed that you’re never too young to change the world; his life in many ways is a testament to that,” Clinton said. “He thought that if he could create a platform that young changemakers could really use to meet each other but also meet experts in the fields that they were drawn to, whether recycling, or global health or online activism or all of the above, it could better enhance the work that they were already doing, but also that they might do over their lifetime.”\n\nTheir goals, to say the least, are ambitious. While there’s no denying the Clinton name has given Chelsea rare opportunities and a chance to reach these goals, she says she doesn’t take anything for granted.\n\n“I’ve been incredibly blessed to have opportunities through the choices that my parents have made and have always felt a real responsibility to work even harder to justify those opportunities that were in no way of my own making, and yet to still be determined to find my own opportunities along the way as well and to be able to marry those two together,” Clinton said. “I think what really matters is where you end up and what you do with where you end up, not so much whether you got there through one ‘aha’ moment or one steady slog.”\n\nAlthough not every student can be part of CGI U, Clinton says anyone can become a social entrepreneur.\n\n“I would say look at what’s worked, and look at what hasn’t worked, and thankfully there are now so many resources online to enable students to get a sense of what’s possible and what’s feasible, so that hopefully when anyone will start off as a social entrepreneur, she wouldn’t get discouraged because she would’ve started so big that it wouldn’t be achievable, or so small that it wouldn’t be inspiring,” Clinton said."
