        "text": "NEW YORK (CBS 2) -- Is Chelsea Clinton's marriage on the rocks already?\n\nReports flying that the six-month marriage is over -- collapsing under pressure from work and family.\n\nIt was the marriage of the year. Last summer, former first daughter Clinton tied the knot with her college sweetheart, Marc Mezvinsky.\n\nBut their marital bliss may have just blown up.\n\n\"I think a lot of people are hoping that there's trouble between Chelsea and Marc, but it's just not the case,\" Daily News gossip columnist Carson Griffith told CBS 2's Hazel Sanchez.\n\nGriffith said the honeymoon is not over for the newlyweds, despite reports the couple has split.\n\n\"Our inside sources between them, looks they're still in love. They're still a young, happy couple,\" Griffith said.\n\nRelated: Bill Clinton Slimmed Down For Daughter's Wedding | Clinton's Crowd Stake Out Star-Studded Guest List\n\nPhoto Gallery: Chelsea Clinton Through The Years\n\nA Clinton family spokesperson confirmed Mezvinsky is on a three-month break from his job as an investment banker, and is hitting the slopes in Jackson Hole, Wyo. His wife stayed behind at their posh Fifth Avenue apartment, where the doorman told CBS 2's Marcia Kramer that Mezvinsky has been missing in action.\n\n\"I have not seen him,\" the doorman said.\n\nSome reports have 30-year-old Clinton seeking an annulment and claiming that she and her husband had been fighting over starting a family. Some believe Mezvinsky may have been feeling the pressure from his secretary of state mother-in-law, a speculation fed by former President Bill Clinton in a recent interview with David Letterman.\n\n\"Hillary wanted this marriage because she wants to be a grandmother more than she wanted to be president,\" the former president said.\n\nA source close to the Clintons told Sanchez Chelsea Clinton and Mezvinsky are very happy, and that she has flown to visit Marc since he left last month.\n\n\"What we can tell you is that instead of relationship crisis it looks like it might be a work crisis for Marc,\" Griffith said.\n\nBut only the couple knows the truth.\n\nChelsea Clinton is currently pursuing her PhD. in public policy at Columbia University."
