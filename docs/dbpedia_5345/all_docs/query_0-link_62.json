        "text": "Chelsea Clinton, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has mocked Donald Trump Jr. online while also dismissing tabloid media reports about herself.\n\nOn Friday, the New York Post, citing unnamed sources, claimed that Chelsea Clinton is trying to land herself a role of ambassador to the U.K. or another job in France, if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election against Donald Trump.\n\n\"There's a reason why Bill and Hillary came out in the first five minutes to support Kamala's presidential bid—they were currying favor,\" a Clinton source told the New York Post.\n\nThe eldest son of the Donald Trump, who beat Hilary Clinton in the 2016 election, was one of those who shared the story online, adding \"shocked\" and three eye-roll emojis in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nIn reply, Chelsea Clinton attacked Trump Jr. for believing the New York Post's story, as well as stating she hopes Harris beats his father in November's race.\n\n\"Must be the same people who said I would run for Congress, get married years before I actually did, and have an alien sibling,\" Chelsea Clinton wrote.\n\n\"Can't wait to elect Vice President Kamala Harris as our next POTUS ... and keep living in New York City.\"\n\nTrump Jr.'s office has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nThe claims in the Post, which have not been verified by Newsweek, cites a number of unnamed sources.\n\nOne of those is a longtime British embassy official, who now lives in London.\n\n\"I can well imagine that the U.K. ambassadorship is an aspiration for Chelsea, although she is a bit junior still—and London usually goes to a massive donor or fundraiser,\" the official said.\n\nChelsea Clinton, vice chair of the Clinton Foundation, previously lived in the U.K while studying at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe claims that Bill and Hillary Clinton endorsed Harris in the 2024 race in order to help their daughter get an ambassador role were reportedly denied by a friend of the couple.\n\n\"There is no truth here. Chelsea is proud to support Vice President Harris and is committed to doing everything she can to ensure she is elected in November,\" they told the New York Post.\n\nIf Harris wins in November, she will achieve what Hillary Clinton failed to do in becoming the first ever female U.S. president.\n\nHarris will also be the first Asian president, and just the second Black president in U.S. history should she win."
