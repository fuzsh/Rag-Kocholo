        "text": "Chelsea Clinton (born February 27, 1980, Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.) is an American author, educator, and philanthropist who was perhaps best known as the only child of politicians Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States (1993–2001), and Hillary Clinton, U.S. secretary of state (2009–13).\n\nChelsea Clinton was born in the spotlight but maintained an ambivalent relationship with the media for much of her life. Arriving during her father’s first term as governor of Arkansas (1979–81), she was featured in the local paper the next day. Her parents, however, attempted to provide her with a fairly normal childhood. They sent her to public schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she showed an acumen for learning and skipped the third grade. When 12-year-old Clinton entered the White House after her father won the 1992 presidential election, her parents made her privacy a priority. They enrolled her in Sidwell Friends, a private school in Washington, D.C., and prohibited the press from interviewing her. She attended political events but rarely spoke publicly or answered questions from journalists. Nonetheless, she still endured sexist jokes and comments from the media and others throughout her father’s presidency. Just before she entered Stanford University, California, in 1997, her mother wrote a commentary in the Los Angeles Times asking the media to give Chelsea Clinton privacy during her college years.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Children’s Books Quiz\n\nAfter graduating with a history degree in 2001, Clinton attended the University of Oxford, England, where her father had studied as a Rhodes scholar in 1968. In her first months at the school, Clinton broke her media silence by penning an essay for Talk Magazine. The article recounted her experience of the September 11 attacks, which she had seen up close while staying with a friend several blocks from the World Trade Center. The undertaking hinted at a budding interest in a more public role. She soon began appearing on the London and New York social circuit and caused a stir when she attended a 2002 Versace fashion show in Paris with a more sophisticated haircut and suit.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton received a master’s degree in international relations in 2003 and worked at a variety of jobs in New York, including a position at McKinsey & Company (2003–06), a management consulting firm, and at the hedge fund Avenue Capital Group (2006–08). She left the latter to join her mother’s 2008 presidential campaign, for which she traveled across the nation and spoke at hundreds of events. Although she did not take interviews with journalists, Clinton cemented her public role when she introduced her mother at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Hillary Clinton lost her bid to then Illinois Sen. Barack Obama but later joined his cabinet as secretary of state.\n\nDuring the next few years, Chelsea Clinton pursued her own activities. In 2010 she earned a master’s degree in public health from Columbia University, New York, and married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky. The following year, while working toward a Ph.D. in international relations from Oxford, Clinton took a seat on the board of the Clinton Foundation, the philanthropic organization her father had founded in 2001. She also became a correspondent for NBC News, contributing to a segment called “Making a Difference,” and in 2012 she began teaching at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. Her hiring at NBC, however, was widely panned, and Clinton left in 2014, the same year she finished the Ph.D. Meanwhile, her role at the Clinton Foundation grew, and she assumed the title of vice chair in 2013.\n\nIn 2015 Clinton published her first book, It’s Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going!, a primer for young adults on contemporary issues and how to take action. Reviews noted that Clinton had the same skill as her parents for explaining tough concepts in engaging digestible language. In 2016 her mother launched another bid for president, and Clinton took an active role, accepting interviews with journalists and appearing on talk shows. Following her mother’s unexpected loss, Clinton returned to publishing. In 2017 she coauthored the well-reviewed Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?, which originated from her Ph.D. dissertation. That same year Clinton also wrote the children’s book She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World, which topped The New York Times best-seller list. Its success led to a number of follow-ups: She Persisted Around the World: 13 Women Who Changed History (2018), She Persisted in Sports: American Olympians Who Changed the Game (2020), and She Persisted in Science: Brilliant Women Who Made a Difference (2022). The book also inspired the play She Persisted, The Musical, which premiered (2019) at the Bay Area Children’s Theatre, in Oakland, California, and a series of chapter books that her publisher launched in 2021. Each title highlighted a different groundbreaking woman and included an introduction by Clinton."
