        "meta_description": "Bill Clinton's former aide has claimed that the former president had once admitted that Chelsea Clinton is not his biological daughter.According to Larry Nichols, the 42nd President of the United States had allegedly said the real father is the former mayor of Little Rock, Ark., Webster Hubbell, who was once a law partner of his wife Hillary Clinton, Radar Online reported.Nichols said that Bill had admitted that he \"shoots blanks\" after contracting measles as a kid rendered him sterile, and added that Hubbell was the real father of his daughter, who is currently pregnant with her first child with her husband Marc Mezvinsky.Earlier, anti-Clinton blogger Robert Morrow had claimed that Hillary had an affair with Hubbell in 1984 at the Governor's Mansion during Bill's second term.These claims will hamper Hillary's plan to run for president in 2016.",
