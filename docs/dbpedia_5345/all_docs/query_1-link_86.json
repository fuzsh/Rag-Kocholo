Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1971: They met at Yale University Library.\n\nThe future president and first lady of the United States met in 1971 while studying together at Yale Law School, with their official meet happening at the library.\n\nAt the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Bill shared the story of how he met Hillary at the Yale University Library after noticing her in class, saying, \"She exuded this sense of strength and self-possession that I found magnetic.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1972: A year later, they worked together on George McGovern's presidential campaign.\n\nEarly in their relationship, the former White House residents embarked on a political endeavor together as they traveled to Texas in 1972 to aid George McGovern with his presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Texas Tribune, Bill served as McGovern's \"Texas political point man\" while Hillary was \"responsible for registering black and Hispanic South Texas voters for the Democratic National Committee.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1973: Bill proposed to Hillary for the first time in Ennerdale, England.\n\nHillary didn't accept Bill's first proposal.\n\nAccording to ABC, Bill proposed to Hillary for the first time in 1973 in Ennerdale, England, but she initially turned him down because she \"needed time.\" Shortly after finding a home in Arkansas, Hillary accepted Bill's proposal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1975: They tied the knot after fours years together with just 15 guests at the ceremony.\n\nAbout two years after getting engaged, Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton wed in the living room of their brand new home in Arkansas with a Methodist minister to officiate, according to The Knot.\n\nJust 15 people attended the private ceremony, but the newlyweds welcomed hundreds of friends to a backyard reception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1976: Bill was elected to his first government official position in Arkansas.\n\nBill's first successful foray into politics came with his election to Arkansas Attorney General in 1976 when he ran unopposed.\n\nHis nomination and election came after a failed run at the House of Representatives in 1974, according to CNN. He lost to the Republican incumbent, John Paul Hammerschmidt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1978: He then became the second-youngest governor of Arkansas.\n\nAfter a two-year stint as the Attorney General, Clinton was elected the governor of Arkansas in 1978 at just 32 years old.\n\nAt the time, he was the youngest governor in the country and the second-youngest governor in the state of Arkansas's history, according to The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1980: The two welcomed their first and only child, Chelsea Clinton.\n\nThe couple became parents to Chelsea Victoria Clinton in February 1980.\n\nAs the only child of the couple, Chelsea spent the first 12 years of her life in Arkansas before moving to Washington DC to become the first daughter.\n\nChelsea currently serves as the Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation, a board member of Foundation affiliate Clinton Health Access Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 1990s: During Bill's presidential campaign, the \"Whitewater controversy\" rocked the couple's budding legacy.\n\nIn the 1990s, the \"Whitewater controversy\" rocked the couple's budding legacy when the United States Office of Independent Counsel investigated the couple in relation to their investment in 230 acres of riverfront land in Arkansas in 1978.\n\nTo develop the land into vacation homes, Bill and Hillary formed the Whitewater Development Corporation with James (Jim) and Susan McDougal.\n\nThe project failed and Jim McDougal bought a small savings and loan association, and, according to Vox \"renamed it Madison Guaranty, and defrauded both it and the small-business investment firm Capital Management Services to the tune of $3 million.\"\n\nThe Clintons came under investigation after it was alleged they were involved in the defrauding.\n\nOf the controversy, according to The Washington Post, in 1994, \"The House and Senate Banking committees begin hearings on Whitewater. Twenty-nine Clinton administration officials are subpoenaed or testify at congressional hearings. All are cleared of any wrongdoing.\"\n\nIn her 2003 memoir \"Living History,\" Hillary only briefly acknowledged the controversy, simply writing there were \"public relations mistakes in how we handled the growing controversy'' and ''Whitewater never seemed real because it wasn't.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1992: Bill was elected 42nd President of the United States and Hillary became first lady.\n\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton was elected 42nd President of the United States, beating Republican incumbent George H.W. Bush, with 370 electoral votes against Bush's 168.\n\nHe was inaugurated January 20, 1993, making Hillary and Chelsea the official first lady and first daughter, respectively.\n\nHe was re-elected for a second term in 1996.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1994: Paula Jones filed a lawsuit against Bill, alleging he made unwanted advances toward her in 1991.\n\nFour years before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, Paula Jones, a former employee of the State of Arkansas' Industrial Development Commission, sued Bill Clinton, alleging that he exposed himself and propositioned her at a conference in Little Rock.\n\nJudge Susan Webber Wright ruled in favor of Clinton stating that the claims did not amount to sexual assault and that Jones had no evidence she'd been punished or emotionally afflicted.\n\nJones appealed for a settlement of $850,000, only $200,000 of which didn't go to legal fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1998: News surfaced of Bill's affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nIn 1998, news broke of President Clinton's 1995 affair with then-22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which eventually led to his impeachment by the House.\n\nSeveral news outlets broke the story of the alleged sexual relationship in January of that year and Bill Clinton denied them.\n\nHillary denied the claims, even going so far as to characterize the accusations against Bill as a \"vast right-wing conspiracy.\"\n\nAlthough Lewinsky initially denied the claims in regards to the Paula Jones case, she later confirmed the relationship and testified twice in front of the grand jury and handed over to prosecutors a dark blue dress that she alleged may contain physical evidence of her sexual relationship with Bill Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAugust 1998: Bill privately confirmed to Hillary his relationship with Lewinsky.\n\nIn an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters in 2003, Hillary divulged the details of Bill's confession of the Lewinsky affair to Hillary: \"I was furious,\" she said. \"I was dumbfounded, I was … just beside myself with anger and disappointment.
