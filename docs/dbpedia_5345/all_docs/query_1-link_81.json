Baby Jasper joins big siblings Charlotte, 4, and Aidan, 3.\n\nThe former first lady shared her joy on the social media site.\n\n\"Sharing some happy news this morning!\" Hillary wrote, sharing her daughter's tweet. \"Bill and I are so thrilled.\"\n\nMore: Tom Brady ripped for cliff diving with young daughter. The Rock says it gave him 'anxiety'\n\nChelsea revealed she and her hubby would be parents again in January on Twitter.\n\n\"Marc and I have loved watching Charlotte be such a wonderful big sister and we’re excited to watch Aidan become a big brother!\" she wrote. \"We cannot wait to meet our newest addition later this summer.\"\n\nChelsea is the author of several children's books. Her most recent, \"Don’t Let Them Disappear,\" a picture book released April 2, is about endangered species and how to help preserve them.\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff"
