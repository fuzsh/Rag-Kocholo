Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky are growing their family by one this year. Clinton, the only child of Bill and Hillary Clinton, announced she is pregnant and due this summer.

This will be the third child for the former first daughter and her financier husband. Clinton and Mezvinsky, who have been married for more than eight years, are parents to Charlotte, 4, and Aiden, 2.

The bestselling children’s book author added that Bill and Hillary Clinton are thrilled.

In 2013, Chelsea Clinton joked that her political parents were putting on the pressure for grandchildren.
