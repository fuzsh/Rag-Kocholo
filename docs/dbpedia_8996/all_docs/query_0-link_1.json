His first major label record 11:59, released via Atlantic in 2010, reached No. 31 on Billboard 200 and No. 10 on Billboard Rock albums chart.[2] Star became known to a wider audience as contestant on the CBS reality TV show Rock Star: Supernova in 2006. His songs have featured on several TV shows and promotion. His song \"Brand New Day\", featured as the main theme to Fox TV series Lie to Me, earned him a BMI TV Music Award in May 2009.[3]\n\nHis first single for Island Records, \"Stay Awhile\" reached No. 28 on Billboard Adult Pop Songs, and its music video has logged over 1 million views on YouTube to date.[4]\n\n\"Stay Awhile\" was released on iTunes August 14, 2012.[5][6]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nStar was born in Huntington, New York on Long Island, and grew up in nearby Dix Hills. He was 14 years old when he formed his first band called Stage. They released four EPs – \"Black\" in 1997, \"Blue\" in 1999, \"White\" in 2000 and \"The Final\" in 2004, and in 1995 studio album \"Historical Underdosing\" and a self-titled album on Maverick Records in 2003. While still in high school, the band played CBGB's and the Mercury Lounge.\n\nWhen the band parted ways, Star became the solo artist R.Star and released his independently produced debut solo album Songs from the Eye of an Elephant on Stone Crow Records in 2005, some songs of Stage was re-recorded for the album (Perfect, Perfect Time Of Night (Back Of Your Car), \"O\", Sink Or Swim).[7]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nStar was a contestant on the second season of CBS' reality show Rock Star where Tommy Lee's band Supernova was looking for a lead singer to front the supergroup. On the show, Ryan consistently showed his diverse style from melodic and moving piano to rocking, and was nicknamed Ryan \"The Darkhorse\" Star by show commentator Dave Navarro. He was eventually eliminated, and days later, Mark Burnett, the show's producer, set up Ryan and the show's House Band to record a live album, to help Ryan jump start his career.[8] He returned to the show on week 11 with the help of his fans through SMS voting, to perform an encore performance of \"Back of Your Car\", and was awarded a Honda CR-V.\n\nRyan Star appeared on the Rachael Ray show and performed \"Breathe\" and \"Start a Fire\" (aired October 6, 2010).[9]\n\nRyan Star appeared on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and performed \"Stay Awhile\" (aired August 14, 2012)[10]\n\nRyan Star and band performed \"Stay Awhile\" on VH1 Big Morning Buzz (aired September 7, 2012)\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAtlantic Records released Last Train Home EP on June 16, 2009, of four songs to appear on Star's album.\n\nThe music video for \"Breathe\", premiered on CNN.com October 21, 2009, highlighted 18 unemployed people in various occupations and the website Ryan Star established breathe4jobs.com to allow potential employers to contact those appearing in the video.[11] VH-1 interviewed Ryan Star on its VH-1 Top 20 show where he spoke of the positive effects of the video for his song \"Breathe.\" One of the people in the video successfully found a job because of the video.[12]\n\nStar's first major label studio album, titled 11:59, was released on August 3, 2010, with a sold-out performance that night at New York City's famed Irving Plaza. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard Rock Albums chart, and at No. 31 on Billboard.com.[2]\n\nRyan Star released a free EP to his fans in January 2012, titled The America EP via Twitter and Facebook. The songs \"Orphans\" and \"Somebody's Son\" were initially meant to be released on 11:59. The EP is dedicated to Star's grandfather who fought in World War II.[13]\n\nAs Atlantic showed no interest to support his new song,[5] Ryan Star recorded and self-released a music video for \"Stay Awhile\" in February 2012, getting attention from MTV Buzzworthy as a breakthrough hit.[14] The video has reached over 1 million views on YouTube as of August 2012. The song also charted on Hot AC and Adult Pop Songs charts based on radioplay.

The label's reaction to his song meant a lot to him as well.[5]\n\nHis single \"Stay Awhile\" was released via Island Records August 14, 2012.
