        "text": "I've developed a bit of a reputation as a 'spoiler.'\n\nIt's not a completely unwarranted accusation, as many of my friends will attest. But in my own defense I think it is because I get so excited by a good story.\n\nIt's what excites me about design as well. I love work that tells a good story â be it with an ingenious logo, a striking photograph or beautiful typography. When those elements come together with a compelling concept, I can't help it. I geek out.\n\nFor the past eighteen years I have been striving to bring that same level of storytelling to my own work, creating branding and design solutions for a wide range of clients, from non-profits to professional sports organizations. I've worked in both in-house and agency settings on a wide variety of projects including branding, logo design, advertising campaigns, brochures, websites and social media campaigns.\n\nSpeaking of stories, I'm also the host of Hi-Res, a one-on-one podcast with creatives in the Philadelphia design community where we talk about the experiences that have helped shape their careers and influence their work. New episodes post every other Tuesday and are available at hirespod.com.\n\nI have a B.S. in Graphic Design from Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport, PA, where I still serve on the Graphic Design Advisory Committee. Over the years Iâve also taken a crack at my own short stories and in 2008 I won the City Paper writing contest for my story, âIronical.â\n\nLet's talk. No spoilers, I promise."
