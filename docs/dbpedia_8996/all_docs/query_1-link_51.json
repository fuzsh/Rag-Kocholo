        "text": "Starr Amara Carter is the main protagonist of The Hate U Give novel by Angie Thomas and the film adaptation from 20th Century Fox. She is portrayed by African American actress Amandla Stenberg in the film.\n\nStarr is the girlfriend of Chris Bryant and was best friends with Khalil Harris, and was there the night of the shooting. She is the sister of Seven and Sekani Carter.\n\nStarr code-switches between two personalities, one for home and certain friends, and another for Williamson Prep. She holds her tongue at Williamson, speaking clearly and not using slang, for fear of being called out for being so-called ghetto. At home, she is herself, and doesn't hold her tongue for anyone. Throughout the novel, she finds the good aspects of both and reaches a middle ground, being open minded yet persistent for what she believes in.\n\nBiography[]\n\nStarr Amara Carter has lived since birth in the residential area of ​​Garden Heights. Before, when her father had just taken over the grocery store, she and her family lived in an apartment building and Starr had asthma from the smoke she inhaled because her father and neighbors smoked. Later, she and her family move to her grandmother's old house. At 10 years old, Starr sees her friend, Natasha, die before her eyes during a drive-by while the two girls are playing near a broken fire hydrant. Following Natasha's death, Starr's parents decide to enroll her in Williamson's school (mainly reserved for white students) rather than the Garden Heights school where the environment is not really conducive to job. In Williamson, Starr meets Hailey Grant who has also just lost her mother (died of cancer). They become friends and support each other having both gone through hardships. Maya Yang arrives later and becomes attached to the group formed by the two young girls. In the group, it's Hailey who decides and the others follow. They have a common passion for the Jonas Brothers and Starr prefers Joe but ends up falling back on Nick following a request from Hailey. They also like to sing songs from High School Musical. One day, Starr tries to reunite her friends from Williamson and her friends from Garden Heights at a slumber party, but the night turns sour and she no longer tries to bring these two worlds together. At Williamson, Starr is on the basketball team and is clearly stronger than her half-brother, Seven Carter. At 16 years and one week old, she obtains her license but does not buy a car because according to her she \"does not have time to work between lessons and basketball\". Starr has a passion for buying and maintaining Jordan baskets and collects several pairs. A little later in the year, Starr begins to date with Chris Bryant (an extremely rich white boy) following the discovery of a common passion for the series of 'the Prince of Bel Air'. The night before the party at Big D, Chris makes a mistake and quarrels with Starr. The next evening, unbeknownst to her parents, Starr is dragged by Kenya Robinson (a friend of hers) to the special annual Spring Break party hosted by Big D. Starr feels out of place and additionally has to put up with Kenya's negative remarks about her look (a hoodie and a pair of Jordans). As the evening progresses, Kenya's real intentions are revealed, as she recognizes the girl she wants to fight. Later, Khalil Harris, Starr's best friend appeared at the party, decked out in new jewelry and wearing new Jordans. Starr regretfully understands that Khalil has taken to dealing (selling drugs in slang) but doesn't comment, lacking the strength. For a few moments they chatted spiritedly until gunshots rang out and forced the guests to flee. Starr and Khalil escape without much problem and They get into Khalil's car, who offers to take Starr home. However, before he could act, they were stopped by a police officer (Constable Cruise) who noticed one of their broken taillights. He orders Khalil to give him his papers justifying his identity but Khalil first wants to know why he is being checked. Finally, at Starr's insistence, he hands over his papers. Agent Cruise reveals to them the real reason for the control and Khalil asks him to \"balance the fine\". The officer is annoyed and orders him to get out of the car. Khalilcomplies and Agent Cruise searches him three times. He sticks Khalil against the back door, and that's where it all escalates. Starr stays put in her seat while Khalil moves and goes to the front door and asks Starr if she's okay. Before he could finish, Agent Cruise pulled the trigger on his rifle once, twice, three times. Khalil collapses, and with him, all of Starr's joy. Starr can't get over Khalil's death and that night she doesn't sleep. When she returns to school, many people around her speak of Khalil as an alleged drug dealer and not as an unjustly murdered teenager. Throughout the novel, Starr will have to fight to make her voice heard and to do justice to Khalil, in particular by testifying in front of a jury supposed to decide on the indictment or not of Agent Cruise. Despite an unfair decision according to her, she promises at the end of the book that she \"will never forget Khalil, that she will never give up and that she will never be silent\".\n\nTrivia[]"
