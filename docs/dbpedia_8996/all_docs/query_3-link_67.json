        "text": "Jamie Trachsel's Ole Miss softball program got better Thursday with the addition of two transfers from the portal. Ole Miss landed commitments from Illinois post-graduate third baseman Delaney Rummell and Syracuse true freshman shortstop Ryan Starr. Rummell has one year to play for the Rebels, while Starr brings with her three years of eligibility.\n\nRummell, a native of Gilberts, Ill., started all 56 games at third base for Illinois this past season, earning a spot on All-Big 10 Defensive Team. She logged a .986 fielding percentage with 58 putouts, 88 assists and two errors. She hit .271 and was named second-team All-Big 10.\n\nStarr, who hails from New York, N.Y., lived up to her last name during her true freshman season at Syracuse. She started 42 games at shortstop for the Orange, finishing with 23 hits and 19 runs scored. She had a .934 fielding percentage.\n\nOle Miss has landed commitments from four transfers over the off-season, In addition to Rummell and Starr, the Rebels have signed Texas infielder Courtney Day and Longwood infielder Jaden Pone.\n\nDay, a graduate transfer, is coming off one of the best seasons of her career in 2023, recording a .308 average with 40 hits, including seven doubles and seven home runs. The Pearland, Texas, native drove in 31 runs and crossed the plate 20 times to help lead Texas to the NCAA Super Regionals.\n\nIn 2022, Day helped Texas advance to the Women's College World Series, where she was named to the WCWS All-Tournament Team after leading Texas over its seven-day stay at the event with three home runs and eight RBIs. At the plate, she hit an even .300 over 57 games played, totaling 39 hits, 21 runs scored, a team-leading 12 home runs, 34 RBIs, and a squad-high .654 slugging percentage.\n\nPone comes to Oxford after spending two seasons at Longwood. The infielder boasts a .412 career batting average with 153 hits, 82 runs scored and 62 stolen bases. A rising junior, she has two years of eligibility in a Rebel uniform.\n\nThis past season, Pone was named Big South Player of the Year and earned a First Team NFCA All-Region nod following an impressive 2023 campaign. The sophomore from Hope Mills, North Carolina, finished the season with a .411 batting average, 36 stolen bases, a Big South-leading 74 hits, and finished tied for fourth in the country with seven triples.\n\nAs a freshman, Pone was named Big South Freshman of the Year in addition to earning first team all-conference honors. She appeared in 57 contests, starting 56 games for Longwood between the outfield and second base. In her first season of collegiate softball, she tallied 79 hits, including a 19-game hitting streak to set the Longwood program record for single-season hits."
