        "text": "Christopher Ryan Starr, usually known as Chris, passed away on February 23, 2024 in Charlotte, NC at age 36.\n\nHe was a bright and cheerful person, a great storyteller who had a knack for making people laugh and engaging others in meaningful, impactful conversations.\n\nChris will be dearly missed by his life partner Vantrease Preston, his parents Tina Lynn Starr Hall and Christopher Alan Hall, siblings Amethyst Alyse (Hall) Perez and Casey Avalon Hall, and grandfather Robert Lawrence Hall. He is preceded in death by his grandparents Thomas Gerard Starr, Shirley Jean Starr, and Betty Jean Hall.\n\nHaving pursued higher education at Appalachian State University, Chris' intellectual curiosity and love for learning were evident throughout his life. He was most recently employed as a Packaging Machine Operator at Frito-Lay of Charlotte.\n\nChris enriched the lives of those around him and will be fondly remembered by all who knew him. A memorial service to honor and celebrate Chris' life will be held on March 9th, 2024, at 2:00PM at the Shelby Church of Christ."
