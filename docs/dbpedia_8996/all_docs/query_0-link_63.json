        "text": "Ryan W.H. Starr, a partner at DLA Piper in Boston, focuses his practice on international taxation, with a special concentration on global tax and operational business structuring, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, post-acquisition integration and global transfer pricing strategy.\n\nStarr has assisted clients that range from start-ups to multibillion-dollar multinationals by providing international tax advice and helping them design and implement principal operating models, tax deferral structures and entity restructurings.\n\nStarr’s practice also includes structuring acquisitions, cross-border financing, and integrating acquisitions.\n\nHe has advised on both small- and large-scale international merger and acquisition transactions while also frequently serving as managing international legal counsel for multijurisdictional and multi-disciplined projects and matters implicating corporate, employment, IP, data privacy and transaction taxes such as VAT and GST, among others.\n\nMost recently, Starr led a DLA Piper tax team in advising Massachusetts-based MKS Instruments, a process control instrumentation company, on its $6.5 billion acquisition of Atotech Ltd., a Jersey Islands publicly traded technology company. The deal closed in August 2022 and Starr continues to advise on post-acquisition structuring.\n\nThe acquisition expanded MKS’s offerings in chip manufacturing through the addition of Atotech’s plating chemicals. Key elements of the representation included deal structuring, negotiating SPA terms and integrating the holding structure and U.S. structure into MKS operations.\n\nStarr also represents of International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF), a New York-based global producer of flavors, fragrances, and cosmetic actives, in complex advisory and integration work. In 2023, Starr’s team designed and implemented a complex carve-out transaction associated with the sale of IFF’s Savory Solutions business for approximately $750 million."
