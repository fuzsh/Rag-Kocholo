        "text": "— Fayetteville’s soccer players had practiced what to do on a free kick, so Ryan Starr knew where to go once the ball was in midair.\n\nWhen the kick left Foster Johnson’s foot on April 20, Starr hollered for his teammates to clear the way for him. He then jumped and knocked a header from six yards out into the back of Springdale Har-Ber’s goal.\n\n“It was a difficult angle, but it worked perfectly,” Starr said. “When I hit it, it felt amazing and I knew it was going in.”\n\nFayetteville’s players immediately swarmed Starr in an outpouring of celebration on Senior Night. The junior forward’s header broke a 2-2 tie with 10 minutes remaining and lifted the Bulldogs to a 3-2 win over Har-Ber that all but assured them of a berth to the Class 7A State Tournament.\n\nStarr’s game-winning goal has been the highlight of a season in which he has dealt with both a position change and a nagging knee injury that sidelined him for much of the nonconference schedule.\n\n“It’s a case of Ryan has unbelievable pace and he’s a great athlete, and I’m trying to find places where he can help the team out,” Fayetteville boys soccer coach Steve Oliver said following Friday’s 2-1 loss at Springdale High.\n\n“And I think tonight he played at the back for a little bit because I know he’s an athlete and can do it. He’s a great key to have on the team for that reason.”\n\nStarr has scored 4-5 goals this season, which equals his production from a year ago when he played midfielder before Oliver decided to move him to forward. At the same time, the Bulldogs (8-6-1, 3-3 7A-West Conference) have found chemistry and used timely scoring to put them on the verge of accomplishing their preseason goal of making the state tournament.\n\n“I think we’re attacking as a team more and combining and working together,” Starr said. “Last year was just more like single attackers, like forwards against their whole (defense).”\n\nStarr admitted he doesn’t have “very good ball-handling skills,” but he has tried to make up for it with his speed. That speed has allowed the 6-foot-1, 165-pound junior to compete for Fayetteville’s track and field team, taking part in the long jump and triple jump.\n\nBut a right knee injury has kept Starr off the runway and away from the soccer field at times over the past few months.\n\n“It’s still a little iffy,” Starr said. “I mean, yes, it is strong, but I still have to wear a knee brace just to keep it from giving out before it’s 100 percent.”\n\nStarr missed the first few weeks of the soccer season because of a strained medial collateral ligament injury and a possible partial tear of his anterior cruciate ligament. He said the knee injury doesn’t bother him as much anymore, but it still affects the way he runs.\n\n“The doctors have given him the ‘all clear,’ so we push him because he’s got that ‘all clear,’” Oliver said. “So some of it is mental with him, which we understand. And also he does a lot of work, he covers a lot of ground, so with that kind of injury it takes time to heal.”\n\nSo how did he feel following his game-winner against Har-Ber?\n\n“It was just a great feeling,” Starr said.\n\nRyan Starr\n\nSCHOOL: Fayetteville\n\nCLASS: Junior\n\nPOSITION: Forward\n\nHEIGHT: 6-1\n\nWeight: 165\n\nNOTABLE: Missed the first few weeks of the soccer season because of a right knee injury that included a strained medial collateral ligament ... Moved to forward this season after playing midfielder ... Has run track and field and kicked for Fayetteville’s football team."
