View the next installment from Ryan Starr, Pastor of Worship Arts at Lakeview Covenant Church in Duluth, MN. He loves spending free time outdoors skiing, hiking and biking with his wife Laura, their three kids and their dog. Ryan enjoys good coffee and honest conversation. After enjoying adventures in Mount Vernon, WA, Grand Rapids, MI, and Chandler, AZ, he is thankful that God has brought them to northern MN."
