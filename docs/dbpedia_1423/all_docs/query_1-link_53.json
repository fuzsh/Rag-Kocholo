His deep-rooted connection to Laredo and the South Texas brush country has not only shaped his character but has also inspired him to make a profound difference throughout the region. Through his leadership in business, philanthropy, and civic engagement, David Winfield Killam truly deserves the honor of being selected as Mr. South Texas,” said Fernando Montemayor, WBCA President.\n\nThe Mr. South Texas designation is presented to a deserving individual who has made a significant and lasting contribution to the growth and development of Laredo and the South Texas region. The formal announcement was made during a press conference held at Texas Community Bank (TCB) in Laredo. The event is sponsored and hosted by TCB.\n\n“Texas Community Bank is pleased to sponsor the Mr. South Texas Luncheon and we congratulate Mr. Killam for being selected as the 2025 Mr. South Texas Honoree as part of the 127th Celebration,” said Douglas G. Macdonald, President & CEO of TCB. “It is a well-deserved recognition. We’re excited to welcome such a fine and hardworking individual to our community and invite all Laredoans to join us in congratulating him.”\n\nThe Mr. South Texas Selection Committee, comprised of past presidents of the WBCA and former Mr. South Texas recipients who reside in Laredo, meet and discuss possible candidates. Committee members take great effort in creating an all-inclusive nominating pool of candidates from all walks of life who have made a significant impact on the area.\n\n“It is a great honor to be named Mr. South Texas and my first reaction was surprise and then I was overwhelmed by a great sense of humility. I would like to thank the Selection Committee and the WBCA for selecting me, and I feel fortunate to join the illustrious list of past honorees,” said Killam.\n\nDavid Winfield Killam was born and raised in Laredo, Texas, a city he has always called home. He attended the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, and later obtained a bachelor’s degree from The University of Texas at Austin, followed by a Certificate in Ranch Management from Texas Christian University. David applied his business acumen to excel in the oil and gas industry, real estate development, and ranching.\n\nDavid and the Killam family have been instrumental in supporting initiatives that enhance the quality of life in Laredo through education, healthcare, and economic development. One notable contribution is the land donation that led to the establishment of Texas A&M International University’s 300-acre campus, which has significantly contributed to higher education opportunities and regional growth.\n\nIn addition to land contributions, the Killam family established scholarship programs at various institutions, including TAMIU, to support aspiring students and improve educational outcomes in Laredo. They were also instrumental in underwriting the University of Incarnate Word Medical Residency Program and the Texas A&M School of Medicine OBGYN rotational program in Laredo, enhancing medical training and healthcare access.\n\nDavid has also contributed easements and land for essential infrastructure such as waterlines, sewer lines, water towers, roadways, and highways, furthering Laredo’s economic prosperity. His commitment to land stewardship and conservation efforts has been recognized with numerous awards, including the Lone Star Steward Award and the Aldo Leopold Conservation Award.\n\nHe is a proud father of two sons and three grandchildren, who serve as cherished sources of joy and inspiration. David’s legacy extends beyond his achievements, serving as a role model for future generations and demonstrating that with hard work, dedication, and passion, anything is possible.\n\nTogether with the Mr. South Texas designation, Ambassador Killam becomes a member of a select group of national and international distinguished men and women who are honored for their dedication and countless hours of service and support to the Washington’s Birthday Celebration each year by an official induction ceremony and presentation of the Caballero Medallion.\n\nOne of the most celebrated and illustrious WBCA events is the Mr. South Texas Luncheon Hosted by Texas Community Bank, attended each year by dignitaries and honored guests from the United States and Mexico. This year’s luncheon will take place on Saturday, February 15, 2025, at 12 p.m., at the Laredo Country Club. Texas Community Bank generously sponsors the event.\n\nThe Mr. South Texas Luncheon Hosted by Texas Community Bank is one of more than 32 events in the Washington’s Birthday Celebration Calendar. Throughout the years, the Celebration has grown to be over a month long and consists of parades, dazzling pageants, fireworks, a carnival, an air show, a sizzling jalapeño festival, and much more.\n\nSave the Date for the 127th Washington’s Birthday Celebration, which takes place January 16 – February 28, 2025.\n\nRussell Lee Cerda and Minnie Dora Haynes Rodriguez - George Washington & Martha Washington\n\nMartha Washington Portrayed by Minnie Dora Haynes Rodríguez\n\nMinnie Dora Haynes Rodríguez is a partner in various South Texas business operations anchored in ranching, mineral exploration, and commercial real estate.\n\nCommitted to her family and community, Minnie Dora serves as a director of the Washington’s Birthday Celebration Association and as a board member of United Day School, the elementary school she attended, and her daughter currently attends.

Minnie Dora’s portrayal of Martha Washington marks the first time within the Society’s history that three generations of ladies – grandmother, mother, and daughter – have each served as President of the Society and portrayed Martha Washington.\n\nThe daughter of J.J. and Minnie Dora Bunn Haynes, Minnie Dora is a graduate of St. Augustine High School, earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Southern Methodist University, a certification from the SMU Cox School of Business Executive and Management Development Division, Summer Business Institute, and her Master of Arts degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio.

The Union Pacific Railroad brought Russell to Laredo in 1986 as a member of the Special Agent department. As the saying goes, he ate a tortilla and drank the water and never left! He will proudly portray President George Washington during the 2025 Washington Birthday Celebration.\n\nSince moving to Laredo, Russell has worked tirelessly for the Laredo community. In 1988 he, volunteered with Special Olympics and shortly thereafter with the Jalapeno Festival. From 2001 to 2011, he served as a volunteer coach for elementary athletic activities at United Day School, which his children attended. His son’s involvement in Scouting led to volunteering as den leader, cub master and assistant Scoutmaster. In 2013, he led a group of high school boys on a 10 day back country hiking trip to the prestigious Philmont Scout Camp in New Mexico.\n\nRussell was invited to join the board of the Boys and Girls Club of Laredo in 2012, and he proudly served as President in 2017; he continues to participate as a Lifetime Director. Russell joined the board of Ruthe B. Cowl in 2019 and currently serves as President of the Board. “Serving my community has brought me great joy and given me a deep connection to the people that adopted me nearly 40 years ago,” said Russell.\n\nHis professional career, which was also spent in service as a police officer, started with the Houston police department and ended with his retirement as Division Manager of the Union Pacific Special Agent department in Laredo in 2017. During his 32-year career with Union Pacific, Russell was selected to serve on many special detail assignments. Among the most exciting was being part of the executive protection service for the Republican National Conventions in Philadelphia and Houston. In 2012, Russell was awarded the Life Saving Award for saving an intoxicated driver from a burning car. A more lighthearted moment of service included escorting the Barnum and Bailey Circus train as it traveled to Laredo complete with elephants and other circus performers.\n\nRussell is married to Christine Holliday Cerda with whom he has 3 children: Alex, Michael and Angelina. He joins them in what has become a family tradition of participating with the Society of Martha Washington and WBCA festivities. Tina was a US Abrazo child in 1973, a debutante in 1984, and Society president in 2019. Sons Alex and Michael served as pages and as escorts. Additionally, Michael was a US Abrazo Child in 2008, and daughter Angelina was presented in 2022.\n\nRussell is looking forward to an exciting year getting to know all the Presentation participants and the many volunteers who work to make the annual festivities such a great success."
