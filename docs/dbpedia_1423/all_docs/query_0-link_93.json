Actions speak louder than words. Plaintiff brings this action for that very reason; to hold Defendant, a sophisticated luxury retail brand, accountable for commercially profiting from, and failing to remedy, its unauthorized, nonconsensual exploitation of Plaintiff’s portrait, image, and likeness as part of a commercial brand activism campaign purporting to support the Black community during Black History Month last year.” Mic drop.\n\nAdrienne Valencia Garcia was appointed to the Board of Directors for the Fordham Law Alumni Association.

Viequenses are amongst the poorest and most vulnerable US citizens residing in the United States. With only two general doctors on the island they have no access to specialty care. Dr. Roure coordinated HMARIA’s first collaborative FREE Vieques Specialty Fair in May 2022 where 65 Viequense were seen at a stationary clinic by dozens of specialists in just four hours, due to ferry limitations. By extending the clinical hours, the second FREE Vieques Specialty Health Fair held on February 4, 2023, was able to see over 160 patients via a stationary clinic and two mobile clinics that went home to home to tend to the elderly and bedridden! Three Viequenses were successfully transferred to the “big island” of Puerto Rico for life saving emergency care. The simultaneous collaborating two-day dental clinic provided FREE dental care to over 100 patients, and patients were transported between both health events to maximize providing care. It was also a great experiential learning experience for the 50+ medical students and 20 doctor volunteers in Puerto Rico to engage professionally. Some had never been to Vieques before and had only heard of the need. Vaya! Eso! It is amazing to see what lawyers with a vision can do when we collaborate with our allies in the medical profession.
