        "text": "U.S. federal district court in California\n\nThe United States District Court for the Southern District of California (in case citations, S.D. Cal.) is a federal court in the Ninth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).\n\nThe District was created on September 28, 1850, following the passage of the California Statehood Act on September 9, 1850. The state was divided into a Northern and Southern district. The Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 abolished the Northern and Southern districts, re-organizing California as a single circuit district. On August 5, 1886 the Southern district was re-established, following the division of the state into Northern and Southern districts. The district was further divided on March 18, 1966 with the creation of the Central and Eastern districts.[1]\n\nThe United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. As of October 5, 2023 the United States attorney is Tara McGrath.[2]\n\nOrganization of the court\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United States District Court for the Southern District of California is one of four federal district courts in California.[3] Court for the District is held at El Centro and the Edward J. Schwartz U.S. Courthouse and U.S. Courthouse Annex in San Diego. The district comprises Imperial and San Diego counties.\n\nCurrent judges\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of May 1, 2024 :\n\n# Title Judge Duty station Born Term of service Appointed by Active Chief Senior 58 Chief Judge Dana Sabraw San Diego 1958 2003–present 2021–present — G.W.

Unlike the Supreme Court, where one justice is specifically nominated to be chief, the office of chief judge rotates among the district court judges. To be chief, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge.\n\nA vacancy is filled by the judge highest in seniority among the group of qualified judges. The chief judge serves for a term of seven years, or until age 70, whichever occurs first. The age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position.\n\nWhen the office was created in 1948, the chief judge was the longest-serving judge who had not elected to retire, on what has since 1958 been known as senior status, or declined to serve as chief judge. After August 6, 1959, judges could not become or remain chief after turning 70 years old. The current rules have been in operation since October 1, 1982.\n\nSuccession of seats\n\n[edit]\n\nList of U.S. attorneys\n\n[edit]\n\nThe U.S. Attorney is the chief law-enforcement officer for the district.[4][5]\n\nJ.
