        "text": "California is divided into four judicial districts to be known as the Northern, Eastern, Central, and Southern Districts of California.\n\nNorthern District\n\n(a) The Northern District comprises the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Sonoma.\n\nCourt for the Northern District shall be held at Eureka, Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose.\n\nEastern District\n\n(b) The Eastern District comprises the counties of Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, El Dorado, Fresno, Glenn, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Lassen, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Solano, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Tulare, Tuolumne, Yolo, and Yuba.\n\nCourt for the Eastern District shall be held at Bakersfield, Fresno, Redding, and Sacramento.\n\nCentral District\n\n(c) The Central District comprises 3 divisions.\n\n(1) The Eastern Division comprises the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino.\n\nCourt for the Eastern Division shall be held at a suitable site in the city of Riverside, the city of San Bernardino, or not more than 5 miles from the boundary of either such city.\n\n(2) The Western Division comprises the counties of Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.\n\nCourt for the Western Division shall be held at Los Angeles.\n\n(3) The Southern Division comprises Orange County.\n\nCourt for the Southern Division shall be held at Santa Ana.\n\nSouthern District\n\n(d) The Southern District comprises the counties of Imperial and San Diego.\n\nCourt for the Southern District shall be held at San Diego.\n\n“The Congress makes the following findings:\n\n“(1)\n\nThe Federal Government has the responsibility to provide quality services which are readily accessible to the people it serves.\n\n“(2)\n\nThe court facilities in the Central Judicial District of California are presently inadequate, and current and projected growth exacerbates the problem.\n\n“(3)\n\nThe population demographics of southern California have changed dramatically over the last decade, as the center of population shifts inland. Between 1980 and 1990, the population of Riverside County increased 76.5 percent, and San Bernardino County’s population increased 58.5 percent, to a combined population of 2,600,000.\n\n“(4)\n\nIn the next 15 years, the population in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties is expected to increase again by 70 percent, and 67 percent, respectively. By the year 2005, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties will have 4,400,000 residents.\n\n“(5)\n\nAs a result of the population growth, the freeways connecting the Pacific coast and the inland areas are tremendously overburdened, and Federal offices along the coast are no longer accessible to the residents of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.\n\n“(6)\n\nThe creation of 3 divisions in the Central Judicial District of California is urgently needed to provide for the delivery of judicial services to all areas and all residents of the Central Judicial District of California.”"
