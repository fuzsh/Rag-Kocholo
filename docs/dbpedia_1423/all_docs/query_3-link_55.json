        "text": "In the United States of America, there are two separate and distinct types of judicial system that have cognizance over the various and sundry legal issues which, from time to time, come to affect the everyday person who lives and/or works in the United States: the Federal court system- which enforces Federal laws, rules and regulations plus applies and interprets the Constitution of the United States, where applicable- and the court systems of the several States, which enforce the laws, rules and regulations of a given State and its Civil Divisions plus applies and interprets the State's own Constitution. These two judicial systems exist side-by-side within the larger context of the American politicolegal system and are byproducts of American Federalism.\n\nThe State court systems can be found elsewhere on this site; the table on this page refers only to the Federal court system and, even then, only to its most basic features. At the pinnacle of the Federal court system is the United States of America's Court of Last Resort, the UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, normally consisting of a Chief Justice and 8 Associate Justices. The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the land: thus, there is no appeal beyond it in any legal case or controversy arising under Federal law; in addition (though, admittedly, the following statement is a somewhat simplified version of its jurisdiction), it can take appeals from the courts of last resort of the several States (the Constitution of the United States being the \"supreme Law of the Land\"- per its own Article VI, clause 2) where a State law is being challenged as violative of the U.S. Constitution and/or a State court has utilized the U.S. Constitution and/or Federal law in what is otherwise an appeal within a State's court system (as is the case in Federal cases, there is no appeal beyond the U.S. Supreme Court re: such State cases as well-- the U.S. Supreme Court is, truly, the Court of Last Resort!).\n\nDirectly below the U.S. Supreme Court in the Federal court system are the U.S. Courts of Appeals and, below these- at the bottom of the Federal court system, the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. District Court is the Court of General Trial Jurisdiction in the Federal system: the vast majority of Federal civil and criminal cases are, therefore, first heard in District Court. Appeal from a decision of the District Court is usually had to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which is the Intermediate Appellate Court in the Federal system (although, under extraordinary circumstances, an expedited appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court [thus, skipping the U.S. Court of Appeals altogether] is quite possible). In most Federal cases which come to be placed on its docket, the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a further appeal from a U.S. Court of Appeals which itself has already ruled on an appeal from a U.S. District Court determination.\n\nThe table below lists the 12 basic Circuits of the Federal court system (in addition, there is the so-called FEDERAL CIRCUIT in Washington, DC which hears appeals from specialized Federal courts that exist apart from the ordinary U.S. District Courts as well as appeals re: certain special subjects from the U.S. District Courts) and those of the U.S. District Courts- one from each of a total of 94 Districts- to be found within each of these Circuits (the usual practice in most Federal cases, therefore, is that an appeal from a given U.S. District Court is heard by judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the District re: that District Court which originally heard the case is located).\n\nThe cities listed immediately following the full name of the courts in the table below are those considered to be the \"headquarters\" of the respective Federal court Circuit or District: this is usually the location of what is considered to be the \"main Federal courthouse\" of a given Circuit or District; where there is a possible question as to just which city holds said \"main courthouse\", the location of the main office of the Clerk (along with, in the case of a District, that of the U.S. Attorney) is held to be said \"headquarters\" city. Please note that these courts are usually authorized to sit in places within their respective Circuit or District other than the \"headquarters\" city indicated: the Clerk and/or U.S. Attorney might also have \"branch offices\" in other places within a given court's jurisdiction; also, some Districts are specifically divided into Divisions (not listed), each with its own U.S. District Court courthouse (though the court that sits therein is exercising jurisdiction over the whole of its respective District and appeal is still taken to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the appropriate Circuit).\n\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS, FIRST CIRCUIT (Boston, MA)\n\nU.S. District Court, District of MAINE- Portland, ME\n\nU.S. District Court, District of MASSACHUSETTS- Boston, MA\n\nU.S. District
