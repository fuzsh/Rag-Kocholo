Surveying the literature which makes up so-called Holocaust Revisionism 1 , the obsession with Auschwitz is undoubtedly one of its defining features. Since the early 1990s, with the advent of the modern world-wide web, Holocaust deniers have taken to the internet to try and argue their case. Until recendy, the ensuing online debates between advocates of Holocaust denial and their critics have likewise focused on Auschwitz. In 2005, there was even a formal debate on Auschwitz between several prominent Revisionists and their critics, hosted at the Real Open Debate on the Holocaust forum. 2 Around the same time, however, a noticeable shift in Revisionist discourse began to make itself felt. After arguing for so long over Auschwitz, and losing those arguments in open court during the Irving vs Lipstadt libel trial of 2000, deniers began to turn their attention to the so-called Aktion Reinhard camps of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. Although these camps had been discussed in passing in many older Revisionist works, it was not until the mid-2000s that they became a veritable fixation for Holocaust deniers. In 2005, sometime National Alliance activist Greg Gerdes created a website to promote a fictitious 'National Association of Forensic Criminologists and Historians' offering a reward for \"proof\" of the existence of mass graves at the three Reinhard camps - what constituted \"proof\", needless to say, was entirely up to Gerdes to dictate. The following year, perhaps inspired by the success of the 9/11 conspiracy video 'Loose Change', another American Revisionist, 'denierbud' (aka 'Mike Smith' from California), released the first substantive attempt at a Revisionist You Tube documentary, the 30-part 'One Third of the Holocaust' video. Anti-deniers noticed that their opponents were losing interest in Auschwitz and becoming more obsessed with Treblinka. Part of the reason for this shift lay in the publication of new Revisionist works on 1 The designation preferred by Holocaust deniers. We have used this label interchangeably with 'denier' and 'negationist' to refer to those who contest the historical veracity of the Holocaust. 2 Archived at http://rodohforum.yuku.com/forums/10/The-Scholars-Debate . Introduction Treblinka and Belzec by veteran denier authors Carlo Mattogno and Jiirgen Graf. Mattogno, an Italian writer, had been active on the Revisionist scene since the mid-1980s, but remained a relatively obscure figure until his works were more extensively translated from Italian to English from the early 2000s as part of the 'Holocaust Handbooks' series edited by Germar Rudolf. Graf, a Swiss German, had made a name for himself on the denier scene from the early 1990s by virtue of being one of the first Swiss deniers to be prosecuted under anti-racist legislation passed in 1995 by referendum. Unusually for Revisionists, both authors had also visited archives together, and began to research a series of co-authored and single-authored books on different Nazi camps from the mid-1990s onwards. With the demise of so many other veteran Revisionist authors and the suspension of the Journal of Historical Review in 2002, Mattogno and Graf have been the 'serious' face of Holocaust denial this century. The motivation for the following work initially arose out of prior efforts to establish a formal debate between Revisionists and non-Revisionists on the subject of the Aktion Reinhard camps, in a reprise of the 2005 RODOH debate on Auschwitz. In 2006, several of the authors of the present work had been involved in refuting the 'One Third of the Holocaust' video at the Holocaust Controversies blog, a refutation that had gone unanswered from the Revisionist side. 3 A formal debate seemed like the fairest way to test denier arguments about the Reinhard camps, and to give the Revisionist side the chance to respond to a considerable number of criticisms that had accumulated of the denier case against the Reinhard camps. It also seemed like the best way to draw a line under what had become a seemingly interminable argument across a number of internet forums, and have it out in the open. While several non-Revisionists volunteered for this event, and the Revisionist side was initially able to assemble a number of volunteers, the Revisionists were not in the end able to establish a debate team, and within weeks of the initial agreement had to declare themselves inquorate. Included among the invitees to join the Revisionist team were notable deniers such as Thomas Kues, Friedrich Berg, and 'denierbud', as well as lesser lights like Wilfried Heink, but the offer was not accepted by these negationist luminaries. Such a failure certainly puts the lie to the oft-heard demand by Revisionists that they want open debate on the Holocaust, a fact reinforced by the censorship tactics employed at the CODOH Revisionist forum. 3 See the posts under 'Debunking Denierbud videos and writings' at: http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2006/04/quick-links.html . Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka. Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard Despite the failure of Revisionists to assemble a debate team, the non-Revisionists decided to go ahead with a response to deniers' arguments regarding the Reinhard camps. At the same time, there also exists a gap in Holocaust literature for a new complete history of Aktion Reinhard; much has been researched in the two decades since Yitzhak Arad published his 1987 monograph on the camps. While this critique cannot claim to serve as that new history, it has synthesized a lot of recent scholarship regarding the camps while also making some new connections based on the evidence, some of which has not been discussed in the available literature before. Moreover, refuting Revisionism was an opportunity for us to expand our historical work on the Holocaust into a larger text than the blog format allows, while synthesizing and developing some ideas already present in those articles. It was also a chance to enjoy the satisfaction of exposing shoddy and deceitful history. We feel that, despite the claims of some commentators that refuting Holocaust denial is a waste of effort, the opportunity to debunk the output of pseudoscholars is one that should be taken for its own sake. It does not mean that we regard deniers as equal debating partners on an intellectual or ethical level; instead, we proceed in the knowledge that deniers operate in ignorance and bad faith. The most obvious targets for such a project were Carlo Mattogno and Jiirgen Graf's Treblinka as well as Mattogno's Belzec. Some other denier works were included in our analysis and study as well, but it was decided that the primary focus of our efforts should remain on the foremost Revisionist researchers. It was also learned (through the private admission of one of the parties involved) that the lengthy article \"Akte Sobibor\" was to form the basis of a new work on the Sobibor camp by Mattogno, Graf, and Revisionist writer Thomas Kues (hereafter MGK). 4 That work appeared midway through the project, but we had been advised by Kues to disregard Akte Sobibor and instead save our efforts for the finished and extended study on the camp. 5 The new work apparently gave members of MGK some added confidence. Since the appearance of Sobibor, after a year of silence in regards to the blog, Mattogno has posted a new response 6 , while Kues for the first time openly responded to a few criticisms of his 4 Carlo Mattogno, Jiirgen Graf, Thomas Kues, Sobibor: Holocaust Propaganda and Reality, Washington: Barnes Review, 2010. 5 Thomas Kues, e-mail message to authors, April 6, 2010. 6 Carlo Mattogno, 'II comitato di soccorso Zimmerman: Glio Olo-Bloggers In(denigr)azione Nel Web,' Studi di Carlo Mattogno, October 4, 2010, http://revisionismo.splinder.com/post/23402176/ilcomitato-di-soccorso- zimmerman ; Roberto Muehlenkamp, 'Mattogno freaks out,' Holocaust Controversies, 7.10.10, http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2010/10/mattogno-freaks-out.html . Introduction blogging and journalism for the Inconvenient History blog and journal. 7 For his part Graf, apparently in the name of \"the authors of Sobibor\" 8 , on two occasions in the past year has challenged the Holocaust Controversies blog crew to write a comprehensive and detailed critique of one of their works, suggesting Sobibor as a potential candidate on both occasions. 9 Unfortunately for Graf and his cohorts, the present writers did not bother to wait for his invitations, nor are we restricting ourselves to just one book. Instead, we took it upon ourselves to critique what we saw as the denier 'trilogy' on the Reinhard camps produced by MGK: Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor. Where relevant we have also included responses to articles, blog posts, or other publications they and other deniers wrote apart from the three core Reinhard books. Reading extensively and studiously through MGK's trilogy and other works was hardly the most pleasant of experiences as a reader. The first thing that became apparent was the unjustifiable number and length of quotations that were used. In Belzec, for instance, the main text plus footnotes weighs in at a measly 46,636 words, while at least 18,494 of those words derived from block quotes. Thus 40% of Mattogno's work was simply quotes, often produced without analysis or comment, or even an explanation on why such lengthy quotes were included. 10 Such an addiction to quotations continued in Sobibor, where the reader is often presented with quotes numbering many hundreds of words. Following the introduction to the work, the reader is immediately hit by an extensive quote from the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust (hardly anything but a tertiary source) running some 2,196 words long. 11 As the main text and footnotes of Sobibor combine to roughly 150,000 words, the first quote already takes up nearly 1.5% of the entire work. The quote percentage of the main work continues to increase as you read on, with archaeologist Andrzej Kola quoted for a combined 3,328 words (2.2%), wartime demographer Eugene Kulischer quoted for 3,298 words (2.2%), Sobibor 7 Thomas Kues, 'Lies and obfuscations about Himmler's Sobibor directive,' Inconvenient History blog, 22.5.11, http://www.revblog.codoh.com/2011/05/lies-and-obfuscations-about-himmlers-sobibor-directive/ ; Roberto Muehlenkamp, 'Thomas Kues on 'Lies and obfuscations about Himmler's Sobibor directive',' Holocaust Controversies blog, 25.5.11, http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2011/05/thomas-kues-on-lies-and- obfuscations.html ; Thomas Kues, 'On the terms Sonderlager and SS-Sonderkommando,' Inconvenient History blog, 27.5.11, http://www.revblog.codoh.com/2011/05/on-the-terms-sonderlager-and-ss-sonderkommando/ ; Roberto Muehlenkamp, 'Thomas Kues' takes on the Sonderlager paper dragon,' Holocaust Controversies blog, 27.5.11, http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2011/05/thomas-kues-takes-on-sonderlager-paper.html ; Thomas Kues, 'Sobibor-Muehlenkamp's \"best explanation\",' Inconvenient History blog, 4.6.11, http://www.revblog.codoh.com/2011/06/sobibor-muehlenkamps-best-explanation/ ; Roberto Muehlenkamp, 'Thomas Kues tries to defuse the Benda report,' Holocaust Controversies blog, 5.6.11, http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2011/06/thomas-kues-tries-to-defuse-benda.html . 8 Jiirgen Graf, e-mail message to authors, 19.10.10. 9 Roberto Muehlenkamp, 'A message from Jiirgen Graf,' Holocaust Controversies blog, 24.6.11, http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2011/06/message-from-jurgen-graf 24.html . 10 This figure would undoubtedly increase by removing the words included through footnotes. 11 MGK, Sobibor, pp.15-20. Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka. Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard survivor and historian Jules Schelvis for 1445 words (1%), historian Christopher Browning for a combined 1,388 words (1%), historian Yitzhak Arad for 899 words (0.5%), historians Peter Witte and Stephen Tyas for 661 words (0.5%), archaeologist Yoram Haimi's team's Sobibor publication for 561 words (0.4%). All of those quotes contain other peoples' research, and their extensive length potentially breaches 'fair use', thus violating copyright. Just in those sources alone we reach nearly one-tenth of MGK's word count for their main text including footnotes. No mainstream publisher would ever accept the manuscripts for such books. The number of testimonies and documents quoted by MGK would no doubt substantially increase such a figure, lessening the amount of original work and interpretation that MGK actually produce. They also use an extensive amount of exclamation marks to emphasize their points, a feature usually completely absent from serious scholarship. The large number of quotes aside, it is still hard to determine many of MGK's actual arguments in their works. Their methodology is scattergun and piecemeal, something highlighted by the publication of one book per Reinhard camp, and largely negationist in approach. The overwhelming majority of the trilogy is dedicated to discussing what did not happen at the various Reinhard camps instead of what did. Such is of course the opposite of proper historiographical methods. Yet even in their negationist arguments one is hard pressed to work out a comprehensive and coherent history. Many witnesses are quoted, and then simply handwaved, ridiculed, or contradicted without any proper explanation about the sources' reliability or general circumstances. Were the witnesses present at the camp but telling lies in their testimony? Were they not present at all? Were they given a script to repeat during interrogations? Is their whole testimony worthless? None of these crucial issues are ever discussed by MGK. They also fail to establish a proper convergence through the different forms of evidence, which leaves their limited attempt to present a positive history when advancing their 'transit camp' thesis largely based on their negationist efforts to read the evidence, and thus renders this thesis completely incoherent. It also became painfully obvious that MGK are extremely repetitious in their works. Many of the same arguments or points were made across multiple writings in a variety of languages. This will become noticeable throughout the critique as multiple locations for MGK's arguments are pinpointed in the footnotes. Despite Graf's challenges to us and despite the limited responses from Mattogno and Kues to previous criticisms, faced with the scale of critique, MGK might feel the sudden urge to think up excuses in order to avoid responding to us. Mattogno had earlier chastised Holocaust Controversies as being \"held in no account by Holocaust historians\" and its writers 10 Introduction 'have published nothing in printed form.\" 12 Such an excuse came about after Mattogno had 13 already responded to some of our blog posts, and so seems rather desperate. Our blog has 14 actually been cited several times by Emory University's Holocaust Denial on Trial website , one of the primary online resources on Holocaust denial, as well as in the scholarly Holocaust collection put together by Pavel Polian and Alfred Kokh. 15 We need not boast about the emails and face to face remarks praising the blog we have received from academics; without naming all of the historians who have expressed their appreciation, we are quite certain that they outnumber whatever praise Mattogno himself has ever received from any academics. 16 Mattogno also claimed that none of the blog members ever visited an archive, a library, have seen an original document, or are aware of the documentary evidence of the camps. This is flat out false, as will be seen in the following pages. Finally, although Mattogno says that we \"love to hide behind pseudonyms,\" only one of the five present writers uses a pseudonym. Moreover, it is grossly ironic for Mattogno to moan about pseudonyms given the aliases used by Mattogno's own co-author 'Thomas Kues', and his former editor Germar Rudolf. 17 The blog does not make a claim to greatness or importance as MGK sometimes do, but instead was established so as to provide a more popular (i.e. not academic) response to the activities of Holocaust deniers. 18 With regard to this primary aim, we consider our blog to be extremely successful. 12 Mattogno, 'II comitato di soccorso Zimmerman.' 13 Cf. Carlo Mattogno, 'Belzec or the Holocaust Controversy of Roberto Muehlenkamp,' http://www.codoh.com/gcgv/gcgvhcrm.html . 14 Emory University's Holocaust Denial on Trial website has several Myth/Fact pages to refute specific denier arguments. The Holocaust Controversies blog is cited in the following issues: '80,000 People Cannot Be Buried In A Grave The Size of a Henhouse,' http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/graves4 ; 'There Are No Mass Graves At Treblinka,' http://www.hdot. org/en/learning/mvth-fact/graves 1 ; 'There are no Mass Graves in Belzec,' http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/graves2 ; 'Mass Incineration: Not Enough Room To Crush The Bones,' http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/incinerationlO ; 'The incineration fires would have needed to (sic) much wood: Part 1 of 2,' http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/mvth-fact/incinerate5 ; 'The incineration fires would have needed to (sic) much wood: Part 2 of 2,' http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth- fact/incinerate6 ; 'Where are the teeth that once belonged to that multitude of incineration victims,' http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/incinerate8 . 15 Pavel Polian and Alfred Kokh (eds), Otritsanie otritsaniia Hi bitva pod Aushvitsem. Debaty o demografii i gepolitike Kholokhosta, Moscow: Tri kvadrata, 2008. 16 One of the authors has given papers on the history of Holocaust denial at academic conferences in late 2008, June 2009 and September 2010, attracting praise and encouragement from several historians whose work is cited in this critique. It may have escaped MGK's attention that Holocaust denial is largely now seen as an object for research by political scientists; historians will in the future be most likely to research the history of Revisionism from the perspective of the post- 1945 collective memory of Nazi atrocities and the Holocaust at best; or to situate the phenomenon into the context of extreme-right political movements and so-called 'secodary antisemitism' after 1945. No historian of our acquaintance takes the historical interpretations advanced by Holocaust revisionism seriously. 17 For more on Rudolf, see Harry Mazal, 'What's in a nym?' Holocaust History Project, http://www. holocaust- history, org/denial/nym.shtml . 18 Nick Terry, 'Intention and Explanation,' Holocaust Controversies, March 23, 2006, http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2006/03/intention-and-explanation.html . 11 Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka. Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard If MGK were to employ such a dodge tactic to refuse a response, then they would obviously bear the brunt of their own sword, for none of the three have submitted anything for a peer-reviewed journal (no denier work is peer-reviewed as there simply are no peers for them), nor do any of them have university credentials. Thus, there is no justification that compels academics to automatically take them seriously. Indeed, this critique shows why Revisionist arguments are anything but. There also was never a great need for the present writers to even bother with MGK's arguments; nor do they consider MGK's work to be so impressive as to demand a mainstream response. A simple survey of the general state of Revisionism is enough to reaffirm to scholars that negationist arguments are unworthy of academic consideration. The most recognized Holocaust denier, David Irving, recanted his earlier gas chamber denial several years ago 19 , and has expressly stated his belief that the Reinhard camps were a site of mass murder. 20 The newer works by MGK do not even appear to be read by their fellow deniers, with their works very seldom referred to in discussion forums and in other Revisionist articles. Thomas Rues' own blog partner recently admitted of the Sobibor book, which has been freely available online for more than a year, \"I've not read what Messrs. Mattogno, Graf and Kues have written.\" 21 Internet traffic counters also support the simple fact that only a very small number of people are actually reading MGK's work. 22 If MGK's own cheerleaders don't even bother with their convoluted work, there is no reason why professional historians should. Indeed the real driving factor behind this critique remained our historical interest in the Holocaust, and the enjoyable experience we had of exposing shoddy and deceitful history. Reading through the collective works and online comments by MGK, it becomes clear to the reader that the trio possess a high degree of resentment and contempt for those who tell a different history than the one they half-heartedly propose. In many instances 19 Irving still challenges gassings in some of the crematoria in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but does accept that hundreds of thousands perished in the bunkers. 20 Marissa Brostoff, 'Holocaust Deniers Rankled by Their Standard Bearer's Revisions,' The Jewish Daily Forward, 3.10.2007, http://www.forward.com/articles/11755/ . 21 See post #10 by Wilfried Heink (aka 'neugierig') of 27.12.2011 in the RODOH discussion thread \"Our Holiday Gift to Mattogno, Graf and Kues: The AR Critique,\" available at http://rodohforum.vuku.com/sreplv/275828/Our-Holiday-Gift-to-Mattogno-Graf-and-Kues-The-AR-Critique . 22 The Holocaust Handbooks website, where all of the series' works can be downloaded for free, including new works such as MGK's Sobibor, was given a rank of 26,240,705 for internet traffic, according to the web information company Alexa in December 2011. This rank is dwarfed by the rankings of the denier websites CODOH (801,960) and VHO (331,727) as well as our own blog Holocaust Controversies (2,792,586). The website SiteAnalytics, operated by Competejnc, cannot even record the number of visitors to the Holocaust Handbooks website as the traffic is so low, suggesting far fewer than 1,000 visits a month, while our blog averages around 7,000 per month. 12 Introduction Holocaust survivors have been blatantly described as liars 23 and stupid. 24 Those Germans who admitted to their participation in the gassings have also been described as traitors. 25 Such scornfulness is also evident against other researchers and historians of the Holocaust, as their honor is repeatedly questioned 26 , as is sometimes even their morality. 27 The very authors of this critique have also been exposed to personal attacks from the trio, being called armchair critics, cowards, and sophists by Mattogno, 28 and liars, disinformers, slanderers and charlatans by Kues. 29 For our part we haven't pulled punches in our analysis of MGK, as people who have voluntarily excluded themselves from peer review can't expect the same civility that academics would give to peers. Rather than indulge in hollow name-calling as they do, however, we have in this analysis focused on exposing their fallacies and left the decision on appropriate epithets to our readers. We have also refrained from saying much about the apparent motives of MGK until the conclusion. Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, the present authors need to address some basic issues such as our general understanding of Aktion Reinhard, a serious review of the current literature on the subject, an explanation regarding the structure of the present critique, as well as personal acknowledgements from the authors. Readers should note two major stylistic differences between this critique and the works of MGK immediately: the structure of the work and the literature review. In their major works, MGK generally follow the odd path of historiography and wartime knowledge, technical matters related to exterminations within the camps, war crime trials, Nazi policy, and then conclude by arguing for the supposed 'real' purpose of the camps discussed. 30 More will be said about our structure later in this introduction. What follows, however, is a conventional academic literature review of the Aktion Reinhard camps.

Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard Overview and Historiography of Aktion Reinhard Between March 1942 and October 1943, nearly 1.4 million Jews were deported to the camps of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. The camps were operated under the auspices of the SS and Police Leader (SS- und Polizeifuhrer, SSPF) Lublin, Odilo Globocnik, and used the codename 'Einsatz Reinhardt' or 'Aktion Reinhard'. German SS men along with companies of Ukrainian auxiliaries trained at the Trawniki camp manned the camps in detachments designated 'SS-Sonderkommando'. The majority of the German staff had previously served in six euthanasia 'institutes' in Germany as part of the T4 organisation named after its headquarters on Tiergartenstrasse 4 in Berlin. There they had helped murder 70,000 'incurable' psychiatric patients using carbon monoxide gas dispensed from cylinders, and to cremate the bodies. The overwhelming majority of the 1.4 million Jewish deportees to the Aktion Reinhard camps died either en route or immediately after arrival, victims of the Nazi 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question'. A tiny percentage were selected after arrival for forced labour either in the three camps or, more rarely, in nearby labour camps, work which the majority did not survive. A significant number of the deportees died en route while still on the trains from asphyxiation or exhaustion. Many more were shot immediately after arrival for resisting or because they were deemed too weak to walk towards the main killing method at the three camps, gas chambers into which carbon monoxide-laden engine exhaust fumes were piped. At first, the corpses of the victims - from whatever cause - were dragged to mass graves by the Jewish slave labourers who had been temporarily spared execution and buried there; later on, the decomposed and decomposing bodies were exhumed and burned on large open-air pyres along with the corpses of newly arrived victims. In two of the three camps, the slave labourers successfully revolted, breaking out of Treblinka in August 1943 and Sobibor in October 1943. Most of the victims of Aktion Reinhard were Polish Jews from the Warsaw, Radom, Cracow, Lublin and Galicia districts of the Generalgouvernement as well as the Zichenau and Bialystok districts annexed into Germany proper. But transports arrived directly or indirectly at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka from Germany, Austria, the so-called 'Protectorate' of Bohemia-Moravia (today's Czech Republic), Slovakia, the Yugoslavian region of Macedonia, the Greek region of Thrace, France, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Belorussia. Virtually none survived. Precisely two out of 17,004 Jews deported from Theresienstadt to Treblinka in the autumn of 1942 were alive at the time of liberation. Among those who did 14 Introduction not survive were three of Sigmund Freud's sisters. 32 Of the 34,313 Jews deported from the Netherlands to Sobibor in the spring and early summer of 1943, just 18 survived the war. 33 How do we know all this? How did we come to know about Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka? A short answer to this question would go something like this: during the war, reports began to appear within a month of the opening of Belzec that large numbers of Jews were entering the camp and not coming out. 34 A growing number of reports reaching the Polish underground state, the Delegatura, as well as Jewish organizations such as the Oneg Shabes archive in Warsaw 35 , led virtually all within Poland quickly to conclude that Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka were sites of extermination. Hearsay rumours of the use of electricity and steam circulated among the Polish and Jewish population of Poland as well as among German occupation officials and troops, but the majority of the reports in Poland converged on the use of gas chambers. Eyewitness accounts were written at the time by a small number of escaped prisoners. 36 The news was communicated in partially distorted form to the outside world. Reports of Belzec and Sobibor reached London along with reports on the Chelmno extermination camp in the annexed territory of the Warthegau, in June 1942. 37 A further crucial report, combining information compiled by Oneg Shabes with Polish underground sources, was brought out by the Polish underground courier Jan Karski in November 1942 38 , and together with other evidence from other regions of Nazi-occupied Europe, led the Allies 32 Alfred Gottwaldt, 'Sigmund Freuds Schwestern und der Tod.

Enormous quantities of ash from cremains as well as other body parts littered the sites, which stank according to visitors who recorded their impressions at the time. 53 Utilising eyewitness testimonies, the physical inspections and investigations of the condition of the sites and a certain number of captured German documents, the Polish Main Commission concluded that Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka had been extermination camps and estimated the number of victims at 1,631,000 (Belzec: 600,000; Sobibor: 250,000; Treblinka: 781,000), rejecting earlier overestimates from disoriented survivors that ranged up to 2 or 3 million per camp. 54 The evidence gathered was then used in certain trials of Nazi officials extradited to postwar Poland. For example the Treblinka investigation was submitted in toto at the trial of Ludwig Fischer, the governor of the Warsaw district. 55 At the same time as investigations in Poland were under way, eyewitnesses began to give testimonies in Western Europe, some from survivors and some from SS men who had crime against the Jewish people.

Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard visited the camps or knew of their purpose. German documentary evidence, not least from the official diary of Hans Frank's Generalgouvernement administration, was examined and conclusively proved that Nazi policy towards Polish Jews was one of extermination, leaving only a minority alive temporarily as slave labourers. The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg as well as the successor Doctors' Trial 56 and Oswald Pohl Trial collectively uncovered the evidence of the T4-Aktion Reinhard connection, the involvement of the SS Economic and Administration Main Office (Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt, WVHA) in the processing of plunder as well as the role of Odilo Globocnik in directing Aktion Reinhard. 57 The Dutch Red Cross launched a systematic investigation of the fate of the 34,313 Dutch Jews deported to Sobibor, based on the records of the Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands and the testimonies of the 18 survivors. 58 Dutch cooperation with the Polish Main Commission over Sobibor was close. 59 By the end of the 1940s, the evidence for extermination at the Aktion Reinhard Camps was sufficiently conclusive that they could be labeled a historical fact. However, only a fraction of the total evidence had hitherto come to light. Historians began the process of - research, aided on the one hand by the publication of many documents and other sources from the 1940s trials, but hampered by lack of access to the full range of sources - as was universal in an era before anyone had thought of a Freedom of Information Act. Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka were prominently discussed in all of the original pioneering overviews by Leon Poliakov, Gerald Reitlinger, Arthur Eisenbach and Raul Hilberg published from 1951 to 1961. 60 Indeed, Eisenbach published the first short English-language overview of Aktion Reinhard in 1962. 61 Outside the academy, survivors and members of the landsmanshaften of the erased Jewish communities of Poland began to compile so-called 56 Ulf Schmidt, Justice at Nuremberg : Leo Alexander and the Nazi doctors trial.

Many, like Christian Wirth, the \"inspector\" of the three camps, had died during the war. Globocnik had committed suicide in 1945, and key subordinates such as Franz Stangl, the commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka, had assumed false identities and later fled to Latin America. Thus it was not until 1948-1950 that the first SS men who had served at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka were interrogated about their activities by detectives from the newly created state of West Germany, in the course of the judicial investigation of the T4 euthanasia program, and then put on trial. 63 Their Ukrainian auxiliaries, however, had been apprehended and interrogated in ever increasing numbers by Soviet investigators starting in September 1944, but it was not until several decades later that these statements began to be made available in the West. 64 In 1958, West Germany began to investigate Nazi crimes systematically through the Central Office of State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes {Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklarung nationalsocialistischer Verbrechen) 65 , and succeeded in apprehending a significant number of the Aktion Reinhard SS, prosecuting them in a series of trials in the 1960s while also investigating and prosecuting the crimes of other SS and Police commands that had been involved in the deportation side of Aktion Reinhard. 66 The capture and trial of Adolf Eichmann prompted a further bout of 62 On the memorial books see Jack Kugelmass and Jonathan Boyarin (eds), From a Ruined Garden: The Memorial Books of Polish Jewry, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998, 2 n expanded edition. 63 Dick de Mildt, In The Name of the People: Perpetrators of Genocide in the Reflection of their Postwar Prosecution in West Germany.

Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard publications of evidence of Nazi crimes, including the crimes of Aktion Reinhard 67 , and saw a number of survivors of Sobibor and Treblinka give evidence during the trial. 68 At the same time, there were a series of trials of Trawniki men in the Soviet Union. From the 1970s, judicial investigations of Aktion Reinhard revolved almost entirely around the Trawniki men, with trials in West Germany of the commandant of Trawniki, Karl Streibel, as well as of a Trawniki man assigned to the Treblinka I labour camp. Trawnikis who had emigrated to the United States and Canada began to be investigated from the end of the 1970s, in the US under the auspices of the Office of Special Investigations 69 , and in Canada by a unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. These investigations benefited from increased cooperation between the Soviet Union, West Germany and North America, and led to denaturalization proceedings and the deportation of Nazis and their collaborators who had lied while immigrating. The most prominent case involved a Trawniki man, Ivan Demjanjuk, who was denaturalized and deported to Israel, which prosecuted him for his alleged role at Treblinka in 1987, convicting him and sentencing him to death. 70 This sentence was overturned on appeal due to the emergence of new evidence and the realisation that this was a case of mistaken identity 71 ; Demjanjuk had not been \"Ivan the Terrible\" but had in fact been a guard at Sobibor. Returning to the US, Demjanjuk was again denaturalized and deported to Germany in 2009, where he was put on trial in 2010 and convicted in May 2011, almost certainly the last man to be tried for his involvement in Aktion Reinhard. 72 Our knowledge of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka does not, however, rest solely on judicial investigations. From the 1960s onwards, journalists, freelance writers and documentary film-makers portrayed these camps using classic journalistic methods, 67 Szymon Datner; Janusz Gumkowski; Kazimierz Leszczynski, Zbrodnie Adolfa Eichmanna.

Documents were uncovered that had remained unknown to the earlier war crimes investigations; contemporary sources ranging from diaries and letters to the contents of Jewish underground archives, the intelligence reports of the Delegatura and Polish underground newspapers were edited and published. Some historians writing on Aktion Reinhard, like Wolfgang Scheffler, had served as an expert witness in the West German trials and produced no comprehensive overview. 78 3 Jean-Francois Steiner, Treblinka, Paris: Librairie Artheme Fayard, 1966; English edition: Simon and Schuster, New York 1967; Gitta Sereny, Into That Darkness.

The publication of the camps encyclopedia Ort des Terrors in the late 2000s combined rather insubstantial entries based on secondary literature for Sobibor and Treblinka, written by the editors Barbara Distel and Wolfgang Benz, with a thorough description of Belzec written by the director of the Belzec Museum, Dr. Robert Kuwalek 91 , whose monograph on Belzec appeared in Polish in late 2010. 92 Kuwalek's counterpart at the Sobibor Museum, Marek Bern, has recently edited a collection of testimonies in Polish 93 , while Russian researchers have produced an oral history of the Sobibor revolt from accounts of Russian survivors. 94 A series of articles on the Trawnikis have also appeared in academic journals and edited collections, including examinations of the cohort of Trawnikis at Belzec by Dieter Pohl 95 as well as studies by David Rich and Peter Black, researchers who work or have worked for the OSI and its successor office within the US Department of Justice on Trawniki cases. 96 Work has also been done on the memorialisation of the sites, research which has uncovered further information about the condition of the sites from 1944 to the erection of memorials from the 87 Bogdan Musial (ed), \"Aktion Reinhardt\".

Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard 1960s onwards. 97 Finally, in the late 1990s and 2000s, archaeologists, most notably Andrzej Kola, have examined the sites of Belzec 98 and Sobibor 99 and provided much more information than had been possible with 1940s techniques and the limited resources of devastated postwar Poland, especially on the size and shape of the mass graves, using techniques such as aerial photography and bore-probes. Further archaeological work is planned for Treblinka. 100 The question \"how do we know about Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka?\" is thus answered: from a variety of investigations. Some have been legal, some have been what the Russians call \"medico-legal\", i.e. forensic; some archaeological; some journalistic; many historical. Accumulating over time, our knowledge and understanding of the three camps - just as with any historical event - has deepened and been refined progressively. Moreover, this process will not stop any time soon. Quite aside from the prospect of further archaeological research, historians of the Holocaust are exceedingly unlikely to leave the subject of the Aktion Reinhard camps alone. The results of the past two decades of research, especially since the end of the Cold War and the opening up of archives in Eastern Europe, have accumulated faster than they can be synthesised into a single work. The time is ripe for a comprehensive monograph on the Aktion Reinhard camps, since our understanding of both the camps themselves as well as their context has changed considerably in the last quarter- century. 101 One or more will undoubtedly be written within the next five to ten years. Bemoaning its absence today would be to commit the single-study fallacy, and to ignore how the exact same issue confronts virtually every topic. Research is ultimately no different to painting the proverbial Forth Bridge: as soon as you have completed one coat, you have to do it all over again. 97 Martyna Rusiniak, Oboz zaglady Treblinka II w pamieci spolecznej (1943-1989).

Berlin: Metropol, 2011, pp.185-195. 24 Introduction Sources The achievements of historians, journalists and judicial investigators in reconstructing events at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka are all the greater because of the extensive destruction of documents by the Nazis, the dismantling of the camps and attempted erasure of the crimes, and the small number of survivors who escaped the camps and lived to testify. In the case of the Aktion Reinhard camps, the destruction of files is a documented fact, as we know from Odilo Globocnik's final report on Aktion Reinhard to Heinrich Himmler. 102 The obliteration of records extends to many institutions who took part in Aktion Reinhard by organising deportations to the camps. Of more than 100 police battalions formed in the Second World War by Nazi Germany, there are extant war diaries for only a handful. Nonetheless, historians and other investigators have been able to piece together the course of events from a wide variety of sources, and this critique has endeavoured to use as many as possible. Just as with the literature cited in what follows, the sources used in this critique were examined by several of the authors over a period of many years, largely while researching other, more conventional scholarly projects. By contrast, MGK's knowledge and use of the potentially available sources leaves much to be desired, and as will be shown repeatedly in what follows, their 'trilogy' largely consists of a string of omissions. Although Holocaust deniers have frequently sought to cast doubt on the integrity of the documents submitted to the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg as well as the twelve successor trials, and many have tried to claim that key documents in these collections are forgeries 103 , it is striking that MGK make extensive use of the Nuremberg documents in their work. We have likewise made use of Nuremberg documents, both from their published versions 104 and from unpublished copies held at the Imperial War Museum annex in Duxford, Cambridgeshire as well as the US National Archives in College Park, MD. Additional examples can also be found online on websites such as the Harvard Law School Library Nuremberg Trials project. 105 102 Globocnik an Himmler, 5.1.1944, 4024-PS, IMT XXXIV, p.71. 103 Most notably, Carlos W. Porter, Made in Russia: The Holocaust, Uckfield: Historical Review Press, 1988; updated online version http://www.cwporter.com/intro.htm . 104 Namely, the 'Blue' Series of 42 volumes of the proceedings of the International Military Tribunal, or main Nuremberg Trial, with English language transcript and documents mostly in the original language, cited in this critique as IMT; the 'Red Series' of 11 volumes of Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, cited as NCA, offering English translations of documents submitted as well as unused at IMT; and the 'Green' Series of 15 volumes presenting excerpts from the 12 US National Military Tribunal 'successor trials', cited as NMT. Scanned PDF copies of all three series can be downloaded from the Library of Congress' Military Legal Resources section at http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military Law/Nuremberg trials.html . 105 http://nuremberg.law.harvard.edu/php/docs swi.php?DI=l&text=overview . 25 Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka. Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard Many documents submitted at the 13 Nuremberg trials were resubmitted in evidence at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, along with other documents identified and copied from a variety of archives by the Israeli prosecution, in all nearly 1,500 documents. 106 While a copy of the transcript has been available on the Nizkor website for many years 107 , it is only recently that the Israeli Ministry of Justice scanned and uploaded copies of almost all of the documents to its website. 108 Hitherto, copies of the microfiched documents were the preserve of larger libraries or research archives such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Together with the Nuremberg documents, the Eichmann trial documents can be considered part of the basic knowledge that serious researchers of the Holocaust must master. 109 Since Mattogno makes use of the Eichmann trial as well as the Nuremberg documents, we presume that there need be no dispute that they are genuine, and will thus ignore one of the more familiar trolling routines used by deniers online. As serious researchers know, the originals of the Nuremberg documents were for the most part reintegrated into the respective document collections, microfilmed by the US National Archives and Record Administration, and then restituted to the Federal Republic of Germany from the 1950s onwards, where they were archived in the Bundesarchiv in Koblenz, since moved to Berlin-Lichterfelde, the Bundesarchiv-Militararchiv in Freiburg, and the Foreign Office archive (Politische Archiv des Auswartigen Amtes) in Berlin. 110 Both the Captured German Documents collection at NARA 111 as well as the restituted files in the German archives have provided several generations of historians with literally decades of research, yet curiously MGK have virtually ignored these collections, citing from just three files from the Bundesarchiv and Foreign Office archive, a number so low that the suspicion is created that they - or rather Mattogno, who it is that cites these files - simply plundered the references from a secondary source, or were mailed a photocopy by Udo Walendy some time back in the day, without ever having seen the document in its original file context. Our research using the Bundesarchiv and NARA files was first conducted for scholarly projects mainly on the Holocaust in the Soviet Union as well as Nazi occupation 106 State of Israel, Ministry of Justice, The Trial of Adolf Eichmann. Record of Proceedings in the District Court of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 1993, 7 volumes. 107 http://nizkor.Org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ . 108 http://www.justice.gov.il/MOJHeb/ReshimatEichman/Guyde.htm . 109 Nuremberg and Eichmann trial documents are cited by code number, thus for IMT documents -PS, EC-, LO R-, RF-, and USSR-; for NMT documents NO-, NG-, NI-, NOKW-; and for Eichmann trial documents TV- . 110 For an overview of this prorcess, see Josef Henke, 'Das Schicksal deutscher zeitgeschichtlicher Quellen in Kriegs- und Nachkriegszeit.

Yet from a very early stage of his research, one of the authors of this critique began collecting documents relating to the Holocaust in Poland 'en passant', often because the relevant files were adjacent, or documents could be found in the same files. More recently, files relevant to the Holocaust in Poland have been sought out over the course of multiple research trips to Berlin and Washington, DC, 112 along with the personnel files of SS officers from the Berlin Document Center collection. Originally administered by the US Army in Berlin, the collections have since been restituted to reunified Germany, after the entire collection was microfilmed for the US National Archives. 113 Other than quoting indirectly from a tiny handful of documents from these personnel files transcribed in published primary source collections, MGK have totally ignored the crucial BDC files. We do not pretend to have exhausted all the research possibilities offered by the BDC, Bundesarchiv or NARA and believe that although the primary collections of captured Nazi documents are very well known to professional historians, new connections and links will continue to be made as these files are examined and re-examined. The same can also be said for the records of West German war crimes trials used in this critique. These trial sources can be divided into several categories. Of central significance for any study of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka are the pre-trial investigations opened up by the Zentrale Stelle at Ludwigsburg into the three camps directly. 114 From what we can discern, MGK have hitherto cited only from the investigation of Josef Oberhauser in connection with Belzec, and rely exclusively on citations from secondary sources for their knowledge of the investigations into Sobibor and Treblinka. 115 The following critique cites from all of these investigations, utilising an extensive collection of copies made available privately to one of the authors as well as from copies made available by Jules Schelvis, whose research files have been archived at the Nederlands Instituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, and which have been recently scanned and put online. 116 Schelvis' research files contain not only copies from the Ludwigsburg investigations, but also from many of the trial proceedings archived in State Attorney's 112 Although original files at the Bundesarchiv were consulted, the USHMM holds microfiche copies of many Bundesarchiv collections, while the same documents are of course microfilmed in the NARA collections, and copied in the Nuremberg and Eichmann trial documents, with the result that some documents have been seen by the authors five or six times in different locations. 113 Copies were consulted in NARA and are cited as NARA-BDC, SS-OA (Offiziersakte), name of officer. 114 Now the Bundesarchiv Ludwigsburg, cited as BAL. 115 Mattogno has also used a few stray citations from euthanasia investigations. 116 NIOD 804, at the time of writing accessible at http://www.archieven.nl/en/search?miview=inv2&mivast=0&mizig=210&miadt=298&micode=804 . 27 Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka. Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard offices and State archives across Germany. 117 We presume that since the publication of the English-language edition of Sobibor last summer, MGK may well have become aware of this online source collection, but we have the sad duty to inform them of more bad news, which is that SS men, Trawnikis and survivors of the Aktion Reinhard camps also gave evidence in the course of many other investigations and trials archived in Ludwigsburg or regionally, including the investigation and trial of Karl Streibel, commandant of Trawniki; of Ludwig Hahn, the Commander of Security Police (Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei, KdS) in Warsaw; and of many other key officers involved in Aktion Reinhard. Although one of the authors of the critique is currently researching these trials for serious scholarly purposes, we have not included even a fraction of the total potential evidence that is available from these cases, and have restricted ourselves to citing a few sources to refute MGK on specific points or to demonstrate the breadth and range of this material. To the extent that Mattogno and Graf have made any kind of name for themselves in the negationist community, it is because of their research trips to East European archives, most especially the former 'Special Archive' 118 and State Archive of the Russian Federation 119 in Moscow, searching out materials on Auschwitz, in particular the massive collection of files of the Auschwitz Central Construction Office (Zentralbauleitung, ZBL). It is quite apparent that whatever files they cite from Polish and Russian archives have been largely scraped together from brief moments on research trips for other purposes. Indeed, of the non-judicial files cited across the 'trilogy', 11 relate to Auschwitz while 7 relate to other concentration camps, leaving only 7 that ostensibly relate directly to Belzec or Treblinka along with 18 to the Galicia and Lublin districts and 4 to the Lodz ghetto. 11 more files from the Moscow archives are quoted in relation to the Holocaust in the Soviet Union, while one file purportedly cited from the National Archives of Belarus is seemingly plagiarised from secondary sources. 120 Measured against the research efforts of serious historians, all these figures are risible. We see no reason why any rational person would prefer to take seriously the word of Mattogno on a subject like the Lodz ghetto when he has across all his writings cited from 117 Most often denoted as StA for Staastanwaltschaft or Staatsarchiv. 118 Now RGVA. 119 GARF. 120 NARB 378-1-784. This file was quoted wrongly in the first edition of M&G, Treblinka, p.200. Soviet archives organised files according to fond (collection), opis (finding guide), and delo (file), which can be cited either as f.378, o.l, d.784, the standard mode of citation for Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian historians, or as 378-1-784, more commonly used by western historiasn. Like MGK we have used the latter mode of citation in this critique. 28 Introduction seemingly only 8 files 121 , whereas there are several monographs on the same topic. Nor would any rational person think that Mattogno had grasped the context of the Holocaust in the Galicia or Lublin districts better than the numerous researchers who have systematically surveyed all the relevant files and woven them into a coherent narrative. Our own research into the materials from East European archives have included research trips to some of the relevant archives as well as the exploitation of the remarkable collection of microfilmed and microfiched copies available at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The sources consulted include among other collections, files of the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission investigations into several of the Aktion Reinhard camps, as well as copies of Red Army investigative reports from the Russian military archive at Podolsk. Of particular significance and importance to the subject of this critique are materials from a variety of archives relating to the Trawniki men. These include contemporary personnel records and related German documents as well as the proceedings of several hundred postwar Soviet investigations and trials of Trawnikis serving at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka as well as other stations in the Lublin district. Among the most important collections are copies of trials from the archives of the Ukrainian SBU 122 , which inherited the Soviet-era records after the collapse of communism in 1991 and which are now available on microfilm at USHMM. As with the records of West German war crimes investigations and trials, these sources are being examined in the course of conventional scholarly research conducted by one of the authors of this critique, and only a tiny fraction of the total volume of such evidence is included here. It is striking that in all of their work, MGK consistently act as if the only source that can be considered a 'document' is a German report. Yet such an attitude is quite frankly the purest gibberish when measured against all known standard practices of historical scholarship ever since they were codified in the 19 th Century. Rankeanism has only one rule, namely to prefer where possible a source that is closer to the events, either in terms of chronology or proximity. Medievalists, after all, are often forced to rely on sources from long after the fact, written down by commentators who were nowhere near the events they describe. Military historians do not have a problem in making use of the records of both sides in a war or conflict. Many historians of the Holocaust have since the 1940s made good use of non- German contemporary documents, most especially the written records of Jewish councils and 121 Counting across Carlo Mattogno, Chelmno: A German Camp in History and Propaganda.

Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard the Polish underground. Such sources are indisputably documents, and we have made use of some of them in what follows. The majority come from published primary source collections, which now include extensive series of publications of materials from the archives of the Polish Delegatura as well as the Oneg Shabes or Ringelblum archive, but also now such things as translations of the records of the Bialystok Jewish Council. We have also made use of a number of files from the Public Record Office in Kew, London, including not only some wartime reports from occupied Poland, but also the important collection of the so-called Police Decodes, German signals traffic intercepted and decoded by Bletchley Park. A small number of unpublished sources from the Polish underground have also been utilised, along with a variety of contemporary printed sources. In such a well-researched field as the history of the Holocaust, it is of course unsurprising that researchers can rely on several generations' worth of published primary sources, including collections of documents, testimonies, letters and diaries. MGK, too, make use of such published sources, but the number of omissions is striking. Like serious historians, Mattogno for example makes extensive use of well-known published documentary collections such as the 1946 volume 'Akcje i wysiedlenia' or the 1960 collection Faschismus- Getto-Massenmord, published by the Central Jewish Historical Commission and its successor, the Jewish Historical Institute in Poland, respectively. 123 Strangely absent, however, are such important published sources as the Goebbels diaries or Himmler's appointments diary for 1941/42, while absolutely vital sources such as the published minutes of conferences in Hans Frank's Generalgouvernement administration are almost entirely omitted, especially for the crucial years of 1942-3. The published memoirs of survivors of Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka must also be considered primary sources, and both MGK as well as ourselves have unsurprisingly referred to them. However, we note with bemusement that their need to cite from memoirs is perhaps greater than ours, especially in their desperate attempt to scratch out any evidence for their resettlement thesis by quote-mining eyewitness accounts. Virtually all the memoirists left earlier accounts, whether in yizkor (memorial) books, postwar investigations or in trials, and thus we have regarded memoirs as simply another source alongside these. Since Mattogno and Graf began writing on the Aktion Reinhard camps in 2002, a number of memoirs have Jozef Kermisz (ed), Dokumenty i Materialy do dziejow okupacji niemieckiej w Polce, Vol. II: \"Akcje\" i \"Wysiedlenia\" , Warsaw-Lodz-Krakow 1946; Tatjana Berenstein et al (eds), Faschismus - Getto - Massenmord.

This has generated the amusing spectacle of M&G's younger colleague Thomas Kues frantically penning a series of 'reviews' of the newly appeared memoirs, always analysing them in virtually splendid isolation and often contrasting them against a strawman version of the history of the three camps. 124 Although several more recent memoirs are analysed in Sobibor 125 , unfortunately there are still more than have appeared which have gone uncommented by MGK 126 , an observation which can also be made about several recent works which republish obscure testimonies from Aktion Reinhard camp survivors 127 or which analyse similarly obscure testimonies from yizkor books. 128 Our approach to the sources, as will be seen in the forthcoming chapters of this critique, is undoubtedly diametrically opposed to the method, if it can be called that, used by MGK in either gathering or analysing sources. The preceding review of sources has made little distinction between documents and eyewitness testimonies, because from a research perspective there is none; both are encountered in archival files, and any historian who still possesses a shred of their sanity is not going to ignore several thousand pages of material which might be found in a single postwar investigation. This does not mean, of course, that when weighing and evaluating sources, we ignore the differences between types of sources; it does mean, however, that we refuse to fetishise certain types of source over others. In our experience, debates with Holocaust deniers invariably involve a combination of rhetorical strategies whereby a denier will find a nit to pick in a witness testimony, then be corrected, then suddenly demand a \"document\", as if history could ever be made to vanish into a puff of smoke because a particular type of source was missing; and then when corrected again will bring out the argument of last resort, and start demanding \"physical evidence.\" The sorry spectacle thus inevitably ends with the denier moaning \"mass graves, mass graves\" over and over, as if they in the grip of a particularly tedious form of Tourette's Syndrome. 124 Israel Cymlich and Oskar Strawczynski, Escaping Hell in Treblinka.

Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard Leaving aside the shocking ineffectiveness of such a rhetorical strategy - because of the immense ennui it causes when the denier goes into autorepeat - this negationist approach to evidence, namely to refuse to consider the sum total of evidence together, is not only nowhere to be found in any known methodology or philosophical consideration of evidence, but also expects the mark targeted for Revisionist rhetorical persuasion to forget all the evidence they might ever have come across when reading about the subject. For many of us, it would be extraordinarily difficult to forget Stangl's confessions or the filmed admissions of Suchomel, so naturally we take them into consideration even when the negationist insists on repeating, over and over, that there is \"no document\" which might \"prove\" gas chambers at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. Well, duh. The files went up in smoke. It is our contention in this critique that such a hyperpositivist demand is intellectually bogus, and reverses the normal chain of reasoning from the general to the particular. Indeed, one can quite easily invoke the much-vaunted Revisionist \"hierarchy of evidence\" 129 to demonstrate this point with a simple thought experiment: would the world regard Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka as Nazi extermination camps where hundreds of thousands of Jews were murdered if there were no surviving witnesses? The answer is an unequivocal yes. We possess more than sufficient evidence from German documents to indicate that large numbers of Jews were deported to the camps, that the Nazis in the Generalgouvernement were exterminating the Jews, and essentially no evidence to suggest that large numbers of Jews came out of the camps. Add in the physical evidence of the condition of the sites after liberation, with their vast piles of ash and cremains, as well as the results of archaeology since then, and the conclusion any normal person would reach by common-sense inference is inescapable. By analogy with other documented Nazi killing sites, as well as the documented involvement of the mass murder experts from T4 in Aktion Reinhard, the rational observer would even be able to conclude - from the German documents alone - that gas was the most probable method. Such a conclusion would harden into a greater certainty when the evidence of contemporary documents from Polish and Jewish sources is taken into consideration. Far from relying \"exclusively on eyewitness testimonies\" 130 , the acceptance of mass murder at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka by everyone other than the tiny minority of 129 Germar Rudolf, Lectures on the Holocaust.

Carlo Mattogno and Jiirgen Graf, Treblinka: Extermination Camp or Transit Camp?, Chicago: Theses & Dissertations Press, 2004, pp.19, 34, 164, 299; 32 Introduction negationists is very much grounded in the reasoning outlined above. That the eyewitnesses might disagree over the exact make and type of the engine is quite frankly irrelevant when set against the totality of the documentary and physical evidence. In the game of scissors, paper and stone deniers want to play, errors in witness evidence cannot be used to refute documents, but this is seemingly the reasoning they want us to follow. Nor do we accept the piecemeal isolation of evidence that passes for MGK's method of source criticism. In our experience, online denier trolls are largely incapable of discussing more than one piece of evidence at a time. MGK may object to this remark on the grounds that they are not Greg Gerdes, but on closer inspection their oeuvre largely disintegrates into a series of decontextualised misreadings of individual sources ripped out of their context by omitting or ignoring other pieces of evidence that confirm, corroborate or converge with the source in question. The ultimate test for any piece of historical evidence, in our opinion, is whether it can be used to construct a historical narrative or historical explanation. A simple litmus test for any claim about the past (whether 9/11, the Cold War, the Nazis, Holocaust or anything else doesn't matter) is whether the claim can be presented in narrative form, telling a coherent story which utilises as much of the available evidence as possible. In this regard, MGK's approach is a miserable failure, as none of their works are written in anything like conventional narrative form, and not infrequently violate simple chronological order in order to construct their attempt at a counternarrative. We do not doubt that MGK believe they are presenting a story of some kind, but we will cast more than severe doubt on their ability to justify their story in the chapters that follow this introduction. Structure of the Critique Our structure is the opposite of MGK's. Whereas they begin with minutiae and nitpicks and only discuss 'the big picture' (policy) in the latter phases of each book, we follow the only logical and acceptable academic convention, which is to start with overall context before analyzing the camp structures and killing methods. This context fills chapters 1-4 of the work, which establish overwhelming proof of decisions to exterminate Jews before we even move inside the camps proper. This proof would exist independently of the perpetrator, survivor and bystander witnesses that we present in chapters 5-8; but those witnesses would also constitute independent proof by themselves, because there is simply no possibility that any power could ever co-ordinate so many testimonies across so many times and places Carlo Mattogno, Belzec in Propaganda, Testimonies, Archeological Research, and History, Chicago: Theses & Dissertations Press, 2004, pp.69, 94; MGK, Sobibor, pp. 22, 39, 76, 177, 289, 392. 33 Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka. Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard whilst silencing all those who would have witnessed resettlement or who would have participated in the hoax that is integral to all denier arguments. The detailed structure develops as follows. Chapter 1, written by Nick Terry, examines the failure of MGK to come to grips with the 'discovery process'; that is, the process by which Aktion Reinhard became known to the outside world. We show how MGK are unable or unwilling to comprehend how wartime knowledge was acquired a"
