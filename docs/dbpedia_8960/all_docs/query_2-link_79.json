This system might be described as a mild form of slavery, only that, instead of one ethnic or national group enslaving another, as has been the rule throughout the history of slavery, in this case the majority of the lower class of a people was en¬ slaved by the upper class of that same people. The abolition of serfdom by Tsai- Alexander II did not change the fact, how¬ ever, that most land was owned by the nobility, so that the peasantry continued to be at the mercy of the nobility to earn an income. The Jews in tsarist Russia, although in their majority not engaged in agricul¬ tural activities, had their own grievances, most notable among them the fact that they were not allowed to settle wherever they wanted, and that they were subject¬ ed to a form of restrictive affirmative action in practicing certain professions. Since the highly urbanized Jews of Russia were on average far more educated than their Christian fellow countrymen, Jews were overrepresented in many intel¬ lectual fields, revolutionary activities included. Although Russia’s Christian peasantry had more reasons to strive for radical change, they were to no small degree kept in line with the tsarist regime first and foremost by their lack of edu¬ cation, but also by the Russian Orthodox Church, which was to no small degree an extension of tsarist power control. It was also a main driver behind anti-Jewish sentiments among Russia’s Christians. Of course, the history of Jewish-Christian animosities goes all the way back to the years when Christianity was born. During the first years of its existence, with the Jews being a powerful majority in Palestine and the Christians a powerless minority, Jewish persecution of Christians prevailed. The tables were turned when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman empire. Ever since, humanity has had to deal with a series of anti-Jewish measures by Christian rulers and the mob. While the uneducated masses may have been stirred up against the Jews with pseudo-arguments such as “Jews killed our Lord Jesus Christ” - which isn’t even true because, strictly speaking, Jesus was killed by the Romans, if we were to take the New Testament’s narrative at face value - the Christian clergy had a more-sophisticated approach to this issue, as is evidenced for in¬ stance by the Roman Catholic Church’s century-long ban of the Talmud for its anti-Christian and anti-Gentile contents, or by Martin Luther’s critique of Jewish teachings in this regard in his book Von den Juden und ihren Liigen (On the Jews 12 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen and Their Lies). While such anti-Jewish attitudes were socially acceptable in Russia and most of Europe during the 19th Century, they are severely frowned upon today, to say the least, although more-recent studies have to a large degree justified the 2,000-year-old critique of Jewish scripture and its influence on the behavior of some - mostly orthodox and fundamentalist - Jews (see Shahak and Shahak/Mezvinsky) . To what degree this anti-Jewish attitude was socially acceptable back then can be gleaned from the Antisemitismus-Streit, an argument among scholars and prominent personalities that erupted onto the public stage in Germany in 1879, although it had been smoldering in less-popular circles many years prior to this and had a tradition going all the way back to Martin Luther. 1 The Jewish newspa¬ per of record. The New York Times, commented on this argument in an editorial on 27 February 1880 as follows: “The war, which has for some time raged in Germany between the natives and the Jews, seems rather to increase than diminish in intensity. It is something more than a popular prejudice, it is a national passion and the ablest, most dignified, and most learned men have ranged themselves on either side. To us here it seems very strange that such a contest of races can be going on in a land of so much in¬ telligence and intellectual pretension, and in the year 1880, too. The crime of the Jews appears to be comprehended chiefly in their financial prosperity. No sin is as great as success in the eyes of the non-successful. The charge is made that of the 600,000 Israelites in the empire, hardly any engage in agricultural or mercan¬ tile pursuits; but that they control trade, rule the money markets, and are eating up the country with their avarice and usury. ” Societal and financial envy were only a side show of this German debate, howev¬ er, while at its core was the criticism of Jewish teachings about how to regard and interact with Gentiles, as laid down in Jewish writings such as the Talmud and the Shulchan Aruch, facts which the New York Times carefully hid from its readers. Fuel into the fire of anti-Jewish sentiments in Germany and in Russia was the publication and analysis - in Russia but also in the German language - of the minutes of the Council of Jews of the Minsk Ghetto (see Brafman), which under¬ girded the accusations that Jews are inherently hostile toward Gentiles. Since the Russian nobility was heavily influenced by German society and to a large degree related to its nobility, political and ideological discussions circulating in the Ger¬ man public inevitably had an impact in Russian intellectual circles. Of course, this is also true for anti-tsarist circles, who eagerly picked up the German ideas of socialism and communism. While the German upper classes fried to cut the ground out from under these radical ideas by creating a constitu¬ tional monarchy and a parliament with far-reaching powers (after the German unification in 1871), and by implementing social reforms and social welfare, A rather comprehensive bibliography of anti-Jewish writings predominantly in Germany from the year 1500 all the way up to 1887 can be found in Frey, pp. 209-219. Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 13 Russia seemed to be too far behind with everything to be able to keep up with the modernization pace expected by the radicals. As a result, the last two decades of the 19th Century as well as the first two decades of the 20th Century were marked by several attempts of political radicals in Russia to overthrow the tsarist regime, stalling with the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881, and ending with the successful revolution in 1917. Considering the backwards, at times even reactionary nature of the tsarist re¬ gime and Russian society in general during those years, one should think that the majority of Christian Russians should have had an interest in radical change just as any other disadvantaged group. In each of these attempts at overthrowing the tsarist regime, however, individuals with a Jewish background were vastly overrepresented among those radicals. While Christians identified with their no- tionally Christian tsars and their rule - or were led to identify with it by way of the Orthodox Church - Jews and other religious groups, as well as marginalized ethnic groups, did not have that allegiance. Jews, being outsiders both by religion and by race - at least they were treated this way, and many Jews saw themselves this way, too - had the highest probability of supporting the most radical changes most vociferously. And so they did. While there were also non-Jews among those revolutionaries, the Russian mainstream was eager to focus on the Jews as the main drivers behind these events. The results were pogroms against the Jews, most prominently among them the ones triggered by the 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II, and by the abortive 1905 revolution. I have described these events in more detail else¬ where, where I also showed that they were the 19th Century’s breeding ground for media buzzwords such as “holocaust” “six million” and “extermination” in connection with the persecution of the Jews in Russia (introduction to Hed- desheimer, pp. 7-37). It is understandable that media outlets such as the New York Times champi¬ oned a development in Russia that would create something similar- there to what existed in the U.S.: a republic with guaranteed civil rights for everyone. The hope that a revolution would do the job can be read between the lines of several New York Times articles of those days. In 1917, the revolution in Russia led to a civil war lasting several years, and it was not clear- at all from the outset that the revolutionaries would win this war. While it was raging, readers of the New York Times learned how the authors and editors of that newspaper trembled at the thought of the revolution failing. They knew that this time, after so much bloodshed, pogroms against Jews would threaten to wipe them out completely. For instance, in an article of 20 July 1921 on page 2 titled “Begs America Save 6,000,000 in Russia”, we read in the subtitle that “Russia’s six million Jews are facing extermination by massacre” as the power of “the counter-revolutionary movement is gaining and the Soviet’s con¬ trol is waning.” 14 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen Of course, at that point everyone not blind to self-evident facts could see that those revolutionary Soviets neither planned to install a republic in the Soviet Un¬ ion nor to grant civil rights to everyone. In fact, news spread throughout the world about widespread massacres by the Soviets against the former nobility, the Christian clergy, the “bourgeoisie,” the “kulaks” (small independent farmers) and, in fact, anyone standing in their way. But at that point, the New York Times and many other similarly minded media outlets in the U.S. had stopped reporting most of the shocking news that should have been fit to print, and instead con¬ cealed with deafening silence the horrors unfolding in Russia. By looking away and supporting the perpetrators - millions of dollars were raised with the help of these newspapers to support whatever was going on in Russia at that time - they had become accomplices in the slaughter of millions, most of them Christians by faith. The terrifying truth about Soviet Russia’s many massacres unfolding during the civil war and in the two decades afterwards, which was plain to see for every¬ one next door in Europe, foremost in Germany, was to a large degree hidden from the American public for decades. In fact, only the Cold War breaking out after the conclusion of World War II allowed for a more balanced view of what had hap¬ pened in Russia since 1917. Who was responsible for these Soviet massacres? Robert Wilton, the correspondent for the London Times during WWI and shortly thereafter, reported for his newspaper about events unfolding in Russia during the revolution. In 1920, while the civil war was still raging, he published a book on The Last Days of the Romanovs, in which he laid out the extreme domi¬ nance of individuals with Jewish backgrounds in carrying out the revolution, and in manning the leadership of the early Soviet Union. More -recent contributions have since confirmed this observation, although many of them are not available in the English language - one may wonder why.2 More convincing for many readers are perhaps statements made by Jews themselves who - confronted with what was going on in Soviet Russia perpetrat¬ ed to a large degree by individuals with Jewish backgrounds - were not only hor¬ rified, but also spoke out in warning as to what that means for Jews in general. The Russian Jewess Sonja Margolina analyzed some of these early voices in her German 1992 book whose title translates to The End of Lies: Russia and the Jews during the 20th Century . This book was never translated into English either. In it, Margolina reviewed in detail a book that had appeared in 1924 in Germany under the title Rufiland und die Juden ( Russia and the Jews). This 1924 book examined the causes of the Russian Jews’ conspicuously above-average participation in the excesses of the 1917 revolution and the tyranny that followed it. The book also contains an appeal by German Jews “To the Jews in all Nations!” where we read (Margolina, p. 58): 2 See for instance Weber 1994; Bieberstein 2002; Solschenizyn 2003. Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 15 “The Jewish Bolsheviks ’ overeager participation in the subjugation and destruc¬ tion of Russia is a sin that already bears within itself the seeds of its retribution. For what greater misfortune could happen to a people than to have its own sons engage in excesses? Not only will this be counted against us as an element of our guilt, it will also be held up to us as reproach for an expression of our power, for a striving for Jewish hegemony. Soviet power is equated with Jewish power, and the grim hatred of the Bolsheviks will transform into a hatred of the Jews [...]. All nations and peoples will be swamped by waves of Judeophobia. Never before have such thunderclouds gathered above the heads of the Jewish people. This is the bottom line of the Russian upheaval for us, for the Jewish people. ’” Margolina quotes further from this 1924 anthology (ibid., p. 60): “ ‘The Russians have never before seen a Jew in power, neither as governor nor as policeman, nor as postal official. There were both good and bad times in those days too, but the Russian people lived and worked, and the fruits of their labors were their own. The Russian name was mighty and threatening. Today the Jews are at every corner and in all levels of power. The Russians see them at the head of the Czarist city, Moscow, and at the head of the metropolis on the River Neva and at the head of the Red Army, the ultimate mechanism of self-destruction. [...] The Russians are now faced with a Jew as judge as well as executioner; they en¬ counter Jews at every step, not Communists who are just as poor as they them¬ selves but who nevertheless give orders and take care of the interests of the Soviet power [...]. It is not surprising that the Russians, in comparing the past to the present, conclude that the present power is Jewish, and so bestial precisely be¬ cause of that. ’” In the early 1990s, German professor Dr. Ernst Nolte, who specialized in the his¬ tory of totalitarian ideologies, also pointed out the Jews’ intimate entanglement in Communism (Nolte, pp. 92f.): “For readily apparent social reasons, was not the percentage of persons of Jew¬ ish extraction particularly great among the participants in the Russian Revolu¬ tion, different from the percentages of other minorities such as the Latvians? Even at the start of this century Jewish philosophers were still pointing with great pride to this extensive participation of the Jews in Socialist movements. After 1917, when the anti-Bolshevist movement — or propaganda - stressed the topic of the Jewish People’s commissars above all others, this pride was no longer expressed, [ . . .] But it took Auschwitz to turn this topic into a taboo for several decades. It is all the more remarkable that in 1 988 the publication Commentary, the voice of right-wing Jews in America, published an article by Jerry Z. Muller who re¬ calls these indisputable facts — though of course they are open to interpretation: ‘If Jews were highly visible in the revolution in Russia and Germany, in Hungary they seemed omnipresent. [...] Of the government’s 49 commissars, 31 were of Jewish origin [...]. Rakosi later joked that Garbai (a gentile) was chosen for his post ‘so that there would be someone who could sign the death sentences on Sat¬ urdays. ’ [...] But the conspicuous role of Jews in the revolution of 1917-19 gave anti-Semitism (which ‘seemed on the wane by 1914’) a whole new impetus. [...] 16 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen Historians who have focused on the utopian ideals espoused by revolutionary Jews have diverted attention from the fact that these Communists of Jewish origin, no less than their non-Jewish counterparts, were led by their ideals to take part in heinous crimes — against Jews and non-Jews alike. Summarizing what was to follow, U.S. journalist Jerry Muller put the two large historical events of the 20th century into this nutshell: “The Trotskies make the revolutions [i.e., the GULag] and the Bronsteins pay the bills [in the Holocaust], ” Hence, the buzzword “Jewish Bolshevism,” which was later used by the German National Socialists as one reason to persecute Jews, was not a pure figment of the imagination, and we do not have to rely on their sources (such as Komrnos 1938) to learn about the veracity of their claims. The counter-revolutionary forces fighting the Soviets in the years 1917 to 1921 were eventually defeated. The Jews of Russia and their brethren abroad could breathe a sigh of relief - for a while. The more the Soviets stabilized their tyranny in Russia, the more they laid their eyes upon other nations where they planned to carry out similar revolutions on their path to their dream of a “world revolution.” Germany was considered the most-important stepping stone to reach that goal. But Germany, defeated and weak after World War I and in constant civil-war-like turmoil, was putting up a tough fight of resistance against such a bloody revolution. The most radical among the counter-revolutionary forces in Germany were the National Socialists, who tried to cut the ground out from un¬ derneath the revolution by making their own top-to-bottom socialist revolution on a national level while at the same time mercilessly combating any Soviet attempt at instigating a foreign-led, Jewish-dominated communist revolution. On a national level, the National Socialists were sensationally successful in the years of peace, but with this success inevitably came confrontation with other foreign powers, among them first and foremost Stalin’s Soviet Russia, which saw its plans of instigating a revolution in Germany foiled, hence considered war the only option left to conquer Central and Western Europe. The German-Russian - or rather National-Socialist-Soviet-Communist - Clash of Titans started on 22 June 1941. The present book tries to uncover what subsequently happened to the Jews who lived in, or were deported into, the tem¬ porarily German-occupied territories of the Soviet Union. Unlike almost all mainstream authors writing about the topic, Carlo Mattogno is aware and takes into consideration that the “information” we have about those events is steeped in Soviet atrocity propaganda; that witness testimony and Soviet forensic expert re¬ ports are equally riddled with distortions, exaggerations and inventions; that the Soviets did not shy away from outright forgeries, even blaming their own massa¬ cres on the Germans, as in the case of Katyn Forest. With the historical record so contaminated with Soviet mendacity, what can we believe? Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 17 Hence, the critically minded scholar - and no other type of scholar should be trusted in these matters - may not take anything at face value; source criticism is absolutely crucial. * * * As National-Socialist Germany prepared her invasion of the Soviet Union, she did so as a counter-revolutionary power, as an avenger for Soviet terror past and present, with the intention to wipe out Judeo-Bolshevism once and for all. The reader of this book will read repeatedly that, as the German army moved into one Soviet city after another, the German authorities taking over behind the advanc¬ ing front found confirmation after confirmation that Jews were indeed the main¬ stay of Soviet power and terror on many if not all levels. But was that really true? Can we take these claims in German contemporary documents at face value? In 2001, Russian researcher Nikita Petrov published a paper which addressed the question to what degree Jews were involved in the Soviet Union’s most prom¬ inent government agency of repression, the NKVD. This was possible because the NKVD itself had kept records on the ethnic affiliation of its employees and associates, and Jews were seen as a separate ethnic group, not as members of a religion. If we look at this data - see the table below - it turns out that up to 1937, Jews filled almost 40% of all the higher positions within the NKVD, while only some 2% to 3% of the Soviet population was Jewish at that time. Proportion of Jews in the upper echelons of the NKVD 10 Jul. 34 1 Oct. 36 1 Mar. 37 1. Sep. 38 1 Jul. 39 1 Jan. 40 26 Feb. 41 Jews 38.54% 39.09% 37.84% 21.33% 3.92% 3.49% 5.49% The drastic decline in the NKVD’s Jewish composition was mainly due to the massacres committed among all government officials in the course of the purges carried out by Stalin in the years 1937/38. Because Jews were so extremely overrepresented among those officials, they were also among the main victims of these purges. It is therefore safe to assume that, when the German army moved into Russia in June 1941, the astounding predominance of Jews in the Soviet state bureaucra¬ cy was to a considerable degree a matter of the recent past. But why, then, did German contemporary reports as quoted in the present book state the opposite? The first question to ask is always: how could they know? It is a fact that most Soviet officials fled when the Germans arrived. What the Germans found out about the ethnic composition of government personnel may have relied more on witness testimony and hearsay than on official records. At least that is the impres¬ sion I received from reading these German reports, for they never mention the thorough analysis of employment records. The next question to ask is: can we trust those witnesses? The answer to this is simple and clear-cut: no, we cannot. Anyone making statements in this regal'd to the Germans was evidently willing to collaborate with the enemy, and with the 18 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen reputation the Germans had as Jew-hating anti-Semites, many witnesses may have anticipated what the Germans wanted to hear. Hence, this is a clear case of confirmation bias. The Germans were probably mostly hearing their own echo rather than independently collected, reliable data. It is also conceivable that claims about Jewish dominance in positions of power contained in these docu¬ ments were completely unfounded, hence made up in order to “justify” mass exe¬ cutions of Jews. Does that mean that the Jews in Russia were not the enemy the Germans per¬ ceived them as? Not necessarily. If we put ourselves into the Jews’ shoes for a moment, there are mainly two things to consider. First, although the Soviet terror apparatus was to an astounding degree “Jew¬ ish” in nature until 1937, that does not mean that most Jews were involved in that apparatus. In fact, by the time of the Stalinist purges of 1937/38, it must have be¬ come clear to everyone in the Soviet Union that literally everyone was a victim of the Soviet or rather Stalinist tenor. Even the perpetrators of that terror regime were caught up in a nightmare of honors which they could not escape, and many of them were eventually swallowed up by this maelstrom they had helped create and maintain. From that point of view, everyone in the Soviet Union needed to be liberated, Jews and Gentiles, perpetrators and victims, government officials and the general populace. Had the Germans moved in with that attitude - to liberate everyone from the Bolshevik nightmare - they might have won the war. But that is not what they did. Instead, the Germans moved in with the attitude of an eye for an eye. And as Gandhi correctly observed, that attitude merely makes the whole world blind. Even if many of Russia’s Jews were not necessarily hostile to the Germans before the war, once the Germans had assumed a radical, to one degree or another elimi- natory anti-Jewish stance when advancing into the Soviet Union, the Jews had little choice but to align themselves with the only power that could and would protect them from the counter-re volutionary, anti-Jewish wrath the Germans were both bringing with them and unleashing among the local non- Jewish populace. Stalin was smart enough to recognize that he had to unite the peoples of his realm and beyond to win this war. So he reinvented Russian patriotism, resurrect¬ ed the Orthodox Church, and rallied the Jews around him - only to revert all this again after the war, but that’s beside the point. Hence, even if Stalin’s Russia in 1938 wasn’t more Jewish than Hitler’s Germany at that time, as the German forc¬ es started committing massacres against the Jews on Russian territories, Stalin’s Russia once more became the central focus of Jewish support - from within the Soviet Union itself, but also from the U.S. and elsewhere. While Stalin turned many of his former enemies temporarily into “friends” and sowed discord among the rest of his enemies, Hitler, with his sweeping anti- Jewish stance and racist attitudes toward the Slavs, sowed discord among his po¬ tential friends and united his enemies. Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 19 Hence, if some Jews weren’t already hostile toward the Germans when the war started, most if not all of them became enemies as it progressed. This in turn served as a justification for increasingly severe German measures against the Jews. This way, a vicious, ever-escalating cycle was created that turned the entire conflict into a bloodbath. In a way, therefore, the Germans created, maintained and helped grow an enemy that needed not exist in the first place. It was a self- fulfilling prophecy of sorts. As noble as the intention was to slay the Bolshevik monster, by applying methods similar to those of the Bolsheviks, i.e., by declaring entire sections of the population as enemies (the nobility and bourgeoisie here, the Jews and Soviets there) - rather than by waging a war merely against ideas - and by perpetrating wholesale slaughters on a scale unprecedented in German history, the National Socialists and with them many millions of loyal German followers turned into a mirror image of the monster they were claiming to fight. It’s an oft-repeated trag¬ edy in the history of mankind. Although these facts can make us understand why things happened as they did, none of it can excuse them. In this sense, the present book tides to shed light on what exactly happened without trying to justify or excuse. Did the Germans go into Russia with the in¬ tention to slaughter all the Jews they got their hands on wholesale? Or was it a reaction to Soviet atrocities and a perception that Jews were primarily responsible for them? What exactly did happen? And how many Jews fell victim to these massacres? The last question in the above list is probably also the most vexing one. Al¬ though Carlo Mattogno has given well-documented estimates in the past about the probable, actual death tolls of certain National-Socialist camps, the reader will be disappointed in this regard with the present book. Although Chapter 5 of Part One deals with this question, it merely makes us realize that it is close to im¬ possible to pinpoint even an approximate figure. As a matter of fact, after having digested this voluminous work, the reader will understand that there are a number of seemingly insurmountable obstacles to determining a death toll. First, the numbers given in German documents are anything but reliable because the data contained in them are, to use Mattogno’ s words “chaotic and disordered,” and the numbers given “almost never coincide with the declared totals” (see p. 271). Many scholars have suspected that the numbers in those documents may be exag¬ gerated, but after reading Mattogno’s analysis, one can safely say that they are entirely unreliable, and that anything is possible: exaggeration and understate¬ ment. Next, there is reason to suspect that the German documents do not include all the massacres that have occurred. Most of these suspicions are based on mere witness claims of massacres that are not backed up by documents. Although mere claims by witnesses do not prove that a massacre occurred, if a forensic team finds a mass grave based on such witness testimony, and there is no known Ger- 20 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen man document confirming that there has been a massacre, this can mean either that it wasn’t documented, or else that this mass grave contains other victims in¬ stead, such as those of a Soviet massacre. Mattogno discusses one such case in Subchapter 1.6. of Part Two. Of course, the other extreme is possible, too, name¬ ly that mass-execution events reported in German documents may have been in¬ vented from whole cloth. That possibility is discussed by Mattogno as well. Ultimately, the only thing that could settle the question as to whether death- toll figures in German documents are correct would be to do numerous complete and thorough forensic exhumations of all victims found in a mass grave associat¬ ed with a documented massacre, determine as best as possible the number and identities of the victims, the probable cause and approximate time of death, and the likely perpetrators. That is standard procedure in any other case of mass mur¬ der. As Mattogno documents thoroughly, however, it is in particular Jewish reli¬ gious authorities who successfully veto that such examinations occur. It is diffi¬ cult to say whether this intentionally or unintentionally obstructive stance will ever change, or whether non-Jewish government authorities will ever muster enough backbone to do what should have been done a long time ago, no matter what some Jewish personality wishes. For now, all we can do is wait and hope. Of course, as decade after decade passes, this task will not become any easier, since the evidence needed to come to clear conclusions deteriorates steadily. Mainstream death-toll claims for massacres committed by the Einsatzgruppen and associated German units usually vary between just under a million (Hilberg 2003, p. 408) and up to three million (Schwarz, p. 220). For now, little can be said about these figures other than that they are more speculative in nature than based upon hard, confirmable data. Their order of magnitude may be in the cor¬ rect ball park, though. If so, these are indeed shocking numbers. But if we com¬ pare these figures with the death toll of Soviet atrocities committed since 1917 until the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, we are dealing with “peanuts.” Es¬ timates of that Soviet death toll up to 1941 range in the tens of millions, hence a factor ten higher than that of Jews (and non- Jews) presumably killed by Germans in the Soviet Union. Yet when we go into libraries of the western world, we find more than 100,000 books on the Jewish WWII Holocaust, but only very few works dealing with the Soviet massacres in the years 1917-1941 - and beyond. Why is that? While mainstream scholars claim that the Jewish Holocaust is one of the best- and most-thoroughly investigated genocides in the history of mankind, or even of any major event in our species’s history, the Soviet massacres - a series of many genocides and non-genocidal mass murders of far greater magnitude - are hardly researched in a systematic and thorough manner by anyone in the western world. The former Soviet-occupied countries which suffered greatly under Soviet rule, such as the Ukraine and the Baltic countries, have done their share of investiga- Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 21 tions since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but they have garnered little attention in the West. Why? The answer to these questions can be found when we realize who holds cul¬ tural hegemony over the western world. This hegemony evidently results in this one-sided and lopsided historical perspective that is hiding cause and effect, and turns history into an unintelligible black-and-white image of supposed absolute evil versus supposed innocent good. The forces that accomplish this are the same forces which, in the U.S. for many years since 1917, have to a large degree hid¬ den from public view what was going on in the Soviet Union. * * * The book you are holding in your hands presents the results of the first-ever revi¬ sionist effort to comprehensively investigate the activities of the Einsatzgruppen behind the German-Soviet front during World War Two. According to main¬ stream sources, the murders perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppen and other associ¬ ated German units encompass roughly one third of the Holocaust, quantitatively speaking (give or take a million victims, depending on the source). It is a vast topic in many respects: by the number of claimed events, by the size of the geo¬ graphic area where these events are said to have occurred, by the amount of source material available, and by the number of - almost exclusively mainstream - studies already published about it. Carlo Mattogno has taken on a huge task. The original Italian edition of this book was published in 2017. That edition has attracted the attention of a group of hostile commentators who, in August 2018, started to analyze and critique it in a series of blog entries online.3 At that point in time, the editing efforts of the present English translation of Mattogno’s book were well under way. Right after I was informed about these critical blog entries, I informed Carlo Mattogno about them. Since it was obvious that these blog entries had just stalled and were to be continued, probably for many months to come, reacting to them would have meant suspending the entire project, wait¬ ing for the bloggers to finish their critique, then do more research and finally re¬ write the book where necessary, first in Italian, then in English. This would have delayed the English edition for a year, if not more. Add to this the volatile nature of blog entries, which can be changed and deleted at a moment’s notice. In other words, Carlo Mattogno was not willing to go on a wild-goose chase just to refute some bloggers. If their critique were to be published in a conventional print for¬ mat where the contents are fixed, then he would consider it. Otherwise, he will not give some hostile critics the power to postpone the publication of his own book ad indefinitum. The reader, on the other hand, is invited to take notice of the arguments of both sides in this debate. When reading about the bloggers’ contentions regarding Mattogno’s comments on the “Jager Report,” for instance, we notice first of all that the alpha and omega of historiography - source criticism - is something the 3 http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/ 22 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen bloggers evidently don’t like at all. All Mattogno does in this regard in the pre¬ sent book is to raise some questions about this document. He does the same with the Einsatzgruppen'' s infamous Incident Reports. Source-critical questions are not illegitimate, as the bloggers suggest, but pivotal. This alone shows the utterly un¬ professional, biased approach of these bloggers. The next thing to notice with re¬ gard to the “Jager Report” is that the bloggers accuse Mattogno of claims or mis¬ takes he did, in fact, not make. Just read carefully what Mattogno wrote and what the bloggers claim (provided they haven’t changed it by now), and you will real¬ ize their skewed perspective. Whether this is due to their incompetence or men¬ dacity may be left for the reader to decide. In another blog entry, they accuse Mattogno of not having used all the sec¬ ondary source material available on some aspects of the present study, and to have taken into consideration only a limited number of witness testimonies. Such accusations are inevitable and unreasonable. They are inevitable, because it is physically impossible to cover all existing sources in a book of a reasonable size written by only one author within a finite time span. In addition, quoting all the secondary sources in existence - of which there are thousands - would be a book- inflating exercise which would only annoy the reader without adding much in¬ formation. At the end of the day, a study such as the present one must be based primarily on primary sources, not on other scholars’ opinions. Furthermore, when it comes to witness testimonies, these accusations are un¬ reasonable as well, because the present book proves with ample examples that many if not most witness testimonies are filled with absurd claims that give rise to the conclusion that we simply cannot rely on them. Adding thousands more of these sometimes absurd and even grotesque statements won’t change that conclu¬ sion. Such expansion of the data pool can only confirm it. At the end of the day, it does not matter how many witnesses have claimed that witches ride on broomsticks and have sex with the devil (not necessarily both at once nor in that order). If it can be shown that many of these statements arc un¬ trustworthy, we need to seek better, more reliable types of evidence. In our case, as already stated, the type of evidence needed consists of thorough and independ¬ ent forensic examinations of the mass graves that can be located. Nothing else will do. If such evidence is never developed or presented, the world will have to live for all eternity with critical, skeptical and even denying voices regarding the claimed Einsatzgruppen massacres. Germar Rudolf 1 November 2018 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 23 Introduction After the end of the Second World War, the nascent historiographical propagan¬ da, which drew its lifeblood from the trials of the various military tribunals against the defeated Germans, concentrated above all on the “extermination camps” and specifically on the homicidal “gas chambers,” which soon became the focus of what was later defined as the Holocaust. During their trial of members of the Einsatzgruppen (September 1947 to April 1948), however, the Americans had brought to the fore the executions perpetrated by these units in the temporarily German-occupied eastern territories. Although these killings were numerically considerable (the indictment repeated the figure of two million victims mentioned in that of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal4), they did not particularly capture the collective imagination, both for the workaday execution method used - shooting, although more-exotic murder weapons were also claimed as a “corrective,” such as the “gas vans” - as well as for their problematic historical context (the merciless warfare against the Soviet Union). Already in 1951, the French Jewish historian Leon Poliakov, in his com¬ pendium Breviaire de la Haine, established the hierarchy of crimes attributed to the Germans by calling the Einsatzgruppen shootings “chaotic exterminations” and the institutionalized killings carried out systematically in “gas chambers” “methodical exterminations.” Precisely because the “gas chambers” captured the imagination in an extraor¬ dinary way and made the alleged crime “unique” in some way, they soon as¬ sumed absolute dominance in the orthodox Holocaust literature, with the Ausch¬ witz Camp as the center of gravity. Even if, stalling with Gerald Reitlinger,5 is¬ sues related to the Einsatzgruppen were investigated with increasing depth, the “extermination camps” and their “gas chambers” kept an unchallenged predomi¬ nance in orthodox Holocaust literature for a long time. Revisionism was born and evolved as a critical re-examination of this central aspect. When the orthodox narrative of Auschwitz, the “symbol of the Holocaust” per se, began to falter un¬ der the impact of revisionist criticism, the emphasis gradually shifted to the so- called “Action Reinhardt” camps, namely Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka, for which specific documentation is notoriously non-existent. Since that edifice also stood on extremely shaky ground (see Mattogno/Kues/Graf 2013), the orthodoxy began concurrently to increasingly emphasize the Einsatzgruppen' s activities, for which there is at least abundant and specific documentation. This trend, already 4 TWC, Vol. IV, p. 53, with explicit reference in footnote 2 to IMT, Vol. I, p. 292. 5 In his 1953 book The Final Solution , Reitlinger devotes two chapters to the Einsatzgruppen. 24 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen inaugurated at the end of the 1980s, especially by Amo Mayer (1988), and further developed a few years later by Michel Korzec,6 has more-recently found new vigor thanks to Father Patrick Desbois (2007/2008). Orthodox Flolocaust studies on the Einsatzgruppen have grown enormously in recent years. This also resulted from the fact that the proper “extermination camps” are now exhausted as a topic of historiography. The latest book with sci¬ entific claims on Auschwitz (apart, for obvious reasons, from the in-house publi¬ cations of the Auschwitz Museum) is Robert Jan van Pelt’s The Case for Ausch¬ witz: Evidence from the Irving Trial , which dates back to 2002. For the “extermi¬ nation camps,” the focus is now only on mere collections of testimonies such as the one edited by Dariusz Libionki for the Majdanek Museum: The Belzec Exter¬ mination Camp in Survivor Testimonies and Depositions of Polish Witnesses, which appeared in 2013. Although it is true that the last orthodox convulsions on the “gas chambers,” published in the anthology New Studies on National-Socialist Mass Killings with Poison Gas, dates back only to 2011 (Morsch/Perz), it marked precisely the col¬ lapse of this essential aspect of the orthodox Flolocaust narrative (see Mattogno 2016b). The research field dealing with the Einsatzgruppen is instead broad and partly unexplored, as a result of which we may expect a substantial shift of the holocaustic center of gravity toward this theme. Although revisionist literature on the Flolocaust has become very diverse and abundant for all these reasons over the past two decades, no revisionist study has existed so far- specifically dealing with the Einsatzgruppen, with the sole excep¬ tion of two 40-page brochures devoted to the subject by Udo Walendy (1983), which are now quite dated and moreover do not address many central issues. The work I present here aims to fill this gap by providing the essential ele¬ ments to orient the reader in this complex topic. Given the vastness of the prob¬ lems involved, I preferred to deal with the fundamental issues as listed in the Ta¬ ble of Contents. Despite this self-limitation, the work has nevertheless become quite voluminous. Unlike the “extermination camps” and “gas chambers,” a large and certainly authentic documentation exists that attests to mass executions of Jews by shoot¬ ing of an enormous magnitude that were carried out by the Einsatzgruppen and other associated units in the German-occupied eastern territories, although the exact death toll is difficult to quantify (see Chapter V of Paid One). In this regard, therefore, it makes even less sense to label revisionist research efforts as “nega¬ tionist” in nature, as does the silly stereotype affixed to revisionism by its adver¬ saries. The fundamental problem is whether or not these shootings were carried out on the basis of a governmental extermination order (by Flitler, Flimmler or Fleydrich), and whether the Jews were shot merely because they were Jews. These two issues arc essential conditions for including these executions in the or- 6 Korzec 1995. The author claimed that, of the 5 million murdered Jews, only “some seven- or eight- hundred thousand were probably gassed.” Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 25 thodox Holocaust as it was defined by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman in their 2002 study Denying History. “When historians talk about the ‘Holocaust’, what they mean on the most general level is that about six million Jews were killed in an intentional and systematic fashion by the Nazis using a number of different means, including gas chambers. ” (P -XV) ' If the killings neither target Jews as such nor were ordered as such from above, they simply did not occur “in an intentional and systematic fashion,” which refers to an extermination order or at least a “decision.” In that case, they would be mere war atrocities in the context of an atrocious war conducted by both sides. Questioning the authenticity of the Einsatzgruppen s reports does not make sense, but the fact that they are authentic does not necessarily mean that their statements are true. On the contrary, their contents at times cause a lot of conster¬ nation, and this concerns not just the death-toll figures, but extends to the well- founded suspicion that certain mass executions mentioned in them may have been completely invented. I will divulge the reasons for this in due time during the present study. Since no certain documentary criterion exists that can be used to gauge the ve¬ racity of the enormous amount of data and numbers contained in the various Ein¬ satzgruppen reports and related documents, I have used the only possible criteri¬ on that can provide at least a defensible order of magnitude: the material criterion of the discovery of mass graves and the coipses they contain. According to orthodox Holocaust historiography, the number of victims of the Einsatzgruppen is said to have ranged from a minimum of about 900,000 (Hil- berg) to a maximum of about 2,600,000 (Arad). These and other figures are ex¬ amined in Chapter 5 of Part One. Because the bodies of the victims were buried, in theory it should still be possible to find them in the mass graves. Hence, the material criterion would allow the corpus delicti to be discovered in a literal sense. It is well known, however, that one of the cornerstones of the orthodox Holo¬ caust narrative on the subject of the Einsatzgruppen is that, since 1943 at the lat¬ est, the Germans are said to have engaged in an institutionalized and systematic activity of locating the mass graves, exhuming the bodies contained in them, and burning the remains of the victims on outdoor fires (the so-called “Aktion 1005”). Given the importance of the topic, I considered it necessary to present it in as much detail as possible. Hence, the entire second part of this work is dedicated to this “Aktion 1005,” meaning the alleged cremation of millions of coipses buried on Soviet territory temporarily occupied by the Germans.

The Einsatzgruppen in the Polish Campaign The Einsatzgruppen that operated in 1941 within the framework of “Operation Barbarossa” had their forerunners in the Einsatzgruppen which were deployed in 1939 (Matthaus/Bohler/Mallmann, pp. 2f.): “During the Polish campaign, the Einsatzgruppen and their subunits, the Einsatz- kommandos (EK), consisted of a force of roughly two thousand members of the German security police (Sicherheitspolizei, Sipo) — a combination of the Criminal Police ( Kriminalpolizei , Kripo) and the secret state police (the notorious Geheime Staatspolizei, Gestapo) under the command of Reinhard Eteydrich — and the Nazi Party’s (NSDAP) intelligence service (Sicherheitsdienst, or SD, also headed by Heydrich). These Sipo/SD units, subordinated since late September 1939 to the newly created Reich Security Main Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt, RSHA) with Heydrich at the helm, were established in the planning phase of the war to cooperate closely with the German military in the goal of ‘pacifying ’ the occupied Polish territories. Almost immediately they became a deadly tool in the repertoire of Nazi subjugation policies, targeting thousands of real or imagined ‘enemies of the Reich ’ ( ‘Reichsfeinde j and enforcing the ‘Germanization ’ of vast parts of Po¬ land. According to estimates, ten thousand civilians were executed during the fighting. Up to the end of October, the German military, SS, and police units shot an additional sixteen thousand Polish noncombatants, among them an unknown number of Jews. ” At first, and during the Polish campaign, the Germans deployed a variety of units: - Einsatzgruppe I. based in Vienna: this was commanded by SS Brigadefiihrer Bruno Streckenbach and consisted of 4 E in sa tz.ko mm a n d o s of 90 men each; their field of action was western Galicia and eastern Slovakia; - Einsatzgruppe II, based in Oppeln (today’s Opole), under the command of SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Emanuel Schafer, with 2 Ein sa tz.ko mm a n dos\\ -Einsatzgruppe III, based in Breslau (today’s Wroclaw), commanded by SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Hans Fischer, with 300 men; - Einsatzgruppe IV, based in Dramburg (today’s Drawsko Pomorskie), com¬ manded by SS Brigadefiihrer Lothar Beutel, with 200-250 men; -Einsatzgruppe V, based in Allenstein (today’s Olsztyn), Prussia, commanded by SS Standartenflihrer Ernst Damzog, initially had 2 Ein sa tz.ko m m a n do s consisting of 250 men each, to which a third was later added; - Einsatzgruppe VI, based in Frankfurt/Main, led by SS Oberfiihrer Erich Naumann, included 2 Einsatzkommandos ; - Einsatzgruppe z.b.V. (zur besonderen Verwendung, for special use), under the command of SS Obergruppenfiihrer Udo von Woyrsch, consisted of 4 battali- 30 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen ons of Ordnungspolizei (regular German police) and 1 Sonderkommando of the Security Police ( Sicherheitspolizei ), with 350 men; - Einsatzkommando 16, formed at Danzig (today’s Gdansk) on 12 September 1939 with a strength of 100 men; its command was entrusted to SS Obergrup- penfiihrer Udo von Woyrsch (ibid., pp. 9-12). An agreement between the Wehrmacht and Sipo/SD regarding “Guidelines for the Foreign Deployment of the Security Police and the SD,” undated (August 1939), describes the tasks of the Einsatzgruppen as follows (ibid.. Doc. 1, p. 32): “The mission of the Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos has been determined by agreement with the Army High Command (OKH), as is confirmed in a letter from the Army High Command (6. Abt.-II-Gen-StdH. No. 1299/39 g.Kdos) dated July 31, 1 939: ‘The mission of the Security Police Einsatzkommandos is to com¬ bat all elements hostile to the Reich and to Germans in enemy territory to the rear of the combat troops. The collection of documents from which the above data are derived dedicates a special section to the topic of “Persecuting Jews,” consisting of 20 documents (Nos. 42-61; ibid., pp. 89-120), made up, for the most part, of testimonies and in¬ terrogations, photographs and quotations from books - there are only five con¬ temporary German documents, only two of which are Einsatzgruppen reports. Document 56 is a daily report by the Chief of the Sipo/SD dated 20 September 1939 from Einsatzgruppe VI. These few lines are the only ones mentioning Jews: the document calls for the formation of “special commissioners to liquidate busi¬ nesses whose Jewish owners have fled” and informs us that “ a total of 40 Jewish businesses in the city of Posen are closed” (ibid., p. 112). The express letter from Einsatzgruppe z.b.V., Kattowitz, to the Sipo in Berlin, dated 8 November 1939 has as its subject “Jewish population” (Jiidische Bevolk- erung). It contains a list of six Jewish communities ( Gemeinden ) from the district of Kattowitz, indicating the total number of inhabitants for each of them, as well as the total number of ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche), Jews and the possible presence of a “Jewish council of elders.” The total number of Jews is very small: 1,875 out of a total population of 251,201 persons. The letter states that “the number of Jews is constantly declining as a result of illegal emigration [Abwan- derung ] or the deportations [ Abtransporte ] from here” (ibid., p. 118). Document 52 is Heydrich’s notorious express letter dated 21 September 1939 (PS-3363) addressed “to the heads of all task forces of the Security Police,” which has as its subject the “Jewish Question in the occupied territory.” In it, Heydrich sets forth his plans, based on the distinction between: “1) the final goal [Endziel] (which requires a longer time frame), and 2) the stages [Abschnitten] in the fulfillment of this final goal (which can be car¬ ried out in the short term). ” His directives are delineated in five paragraphs: Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 31 “The first prerequisite for the final goal is initially to concentrate the Jews from rural areas in the larger cities. ’’ This is followed by instructions for the formation of a “Jewish council of elders” (“In each Jewish community, a council of Jewish elders is to be established, composed, if possible, of remaining influential individuals and rabbis. The coun¬ cil of elders is to consist of up to 24 male Jews (depending on the size of the Jew¬ ish community)”); the necessary measures were taken in close collaboration with the authorities of the local civil and military administration. Paragraph IV ad¬ dressed the activities of the Einsatzgruppen with regard to the Jews (ibid., pp. 104-108): “The chiefs of the Einsatzgruppen will report to me on an ongoing basis regard¬ ing the following matters: 1) Numerical overview of the Jews present in their areas (if possible, broken down into the categories indicated above). Here the numbers of Jews being evac¬ uated [zur Abwanderung gebracht| from the countryside and the numbers of Jews already in the cities are to be stated separately. 2) Names of the cities that have been designated as points of concentration [Kon- zentrierungspunkte]. 3) The deadlines set for moving [zur Abwanderung] the Jews to the cities. 4) Overview of all Jewish-owned branches of industry and enterprises within their areas that are of vital and strategic importance or are relevant to the Four Year Plan. ” The “final goal” referred to deportation or expulsion, as may be deduced from Document 54, a file memo by RSHA “resettlement” expert SS Hauptsturmfiihrer Adolf Eichmann dated 6 October 1939, which refers to a discussion with Gaulei¬ ter Wagner at Kattowitz “regarding the expulsion of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from the Kattowitz District” and to a concurrent expulsion of Jews from the town of Mahrisch Ostrau (ibid., pp. 109f.). In June 1939, Walter Stahlecker, the future commandant of Einsatzgruppe A, was appointed Commander of the Security Police and the SD at Prague. A file memo dated 16 October informs us that on 12 October, SS Oberfiihrer Stahleck¬ er, together with SS Hauptsturmfiihrer Eichmann, had traveled from Mahrisch Ostrau to Cracow to discuss the “Establishment of an appropriate area for the set¬ tlement of Jews” and reports:7 “In addition to the establishment of an appropriate area, the food conditions, housing possibilities, if any, and the transport 's travel route should be clarified with the prospective terminus. ” This was in relation to the plan for a Jewish reservation in the area of Nisko, in southwestern Poland. The first Jewish transport from Mahrisch Ostrau left on the morning of 15 October to build a “transit camp” at Nisko, a locality on the river San, as stated in the related “daily report” from the head of the SD office at Mah- 7 YVA, 0.53-87, p. 129. 32 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen risch Ostrau.8 The term probably referred to the fact that Nisko was the destina¬ tion railway station whence the deportees were then distributed within the region. In conclusion, no German document attributes executions of Jews to the Ein¬ satzgruppen in Poland. If the estimate adopted by Matthaus et al. - that of 26,000 Polish civilians killed, including an unknown number of Jews - is based on Ger¬ man documents, we are not told which ones they are. As regards the Jews, Szy- mon Datner presents a thorough set of statistics on executions carried out by the Germans in Poland between 1 September and 25 October 1939, during the first 55 days of the occupation. It lists the number of executions and victims in two columns, showing 12,137 (September) and 4,199 victims (1-25 October), for a total of 16,336 victims (Datner 1967, pp. 110-112). It then provides a breakdown of these victims into twelve voivodats (ibid., pp. 113-117); another table summa¬ rizes these data, also reporting the percentage of the 16,336 victims and those of the 714 executions (ibid., p. 118). Jews are mentioned only in the table “ Liczba ofiar ” (number of victims), which refers to executions carried out in the district of Lodz, namely, 2,387 of the 2,393 victims, which are distributed as follows: - executions in which only Poles died: 1,773 victims - executions in which only Jews died: 1 12 victims - executions in which Poles and Jews died: 502 (ibid., p. 120). If these figures be accepted, what do they mean? What is the relationship between the activities of the Einsatzgruppen in the Polish campaign and those in the Rus¬ sian campaign? The authors of the document collection cited above only provide a partial answer to these questions. Within the scope of “Operation Barbarossa,” the Einsatzgruppen killed “between five and eight hundred thousand civilians, the overwhelming majority of them Jews”; these units moreover “recorded many - though far from all - of these murders and communicated the details back to the RSHA, which compiled extensive reports on German occupation policy in the Soviet Union.” But what made such violence possible? The roots of the violence were derived from the activities of the Einsatzgruppen during the Polish cam¬ paign, and, more precisely, in the concept of “‘pacifying’ the real- army areas,” implying a sort of complicity on the paid of the Wehrmacht (Matthaus/Bohler/ Mallmann, pp. 154f.): “On March 30, 1941, just as he had on August 22, 1939 prior to the attack on Po¬ land, he [Hitler] put forward his views before the assembled senior generals, but this time with even more ominous implications : Bolshevism was an ‘asocial crime Germany would ‘have to step back from soldierly comradeship. The communist was not and is not a comrade. This is a fight of annihilation. ’ The war was about the ‘destruction of the Bolshevist commissars and the communist intel¬ ligentsia ’, a task that the Wehrmacht could not accomplish alone and that called for the assistance of Himmler’s forces. ” 8 YVA, 0.53-87, p. 149. Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 33 This explains the difference in the Einsatzgruppen ’s activities during the Polish and the Russian campaign: both were focusing on “pacifying” the areas behind the front, but in Poland, the Einsatzgruppen were only fighting Jews, while in the Soviet Union, they were fighting “Judeo-Bolshevism,” which explains why the killings in Poland were very limited, and incomparably greater in the conquered Soviet territories. This concept found expression in the very first Einsatzgruppen reports. Ereignismeldung (EM; Incident Report) No. 31 dated 23 July 1941 expresses it as follows (Mallmann 2011 et al., p. 166): “At least one and a half million Jews live in the Byelorussian settlement area; their sociological structure in the former Polish and former Soviet areas is not uniform. While the Jews in former Poland were officially insignificant and en¬ joyed no particular protection as Jews, in the Soviet Union they considered them¬ selves part of the ruling class. Polish Jews lived in constant fear of hostile popu¬ lar demonstrations; wherever they were not clearly in the majority, they consid¬ ered it advisable to tread carefully and timidly. Soviet Jews, by contrast, had been stiffened up by a quarter century of J ewish -Bolshevist rule, so much so that they very often behaved self -confidently, even arrogantly, even when German troops moved in. ” In his comment on the “Draft of establishing provisional guidelines for the treat¬ ment of Jews in the area of RKO” [Reichskommissariat for the East] dated 6 Au¬ gust 1941, Walter Stahlecker, commander of Einsatzgruppe A, reiterated (An- grick et al.. Doc. 37, p. 92): “Leaving the Jews in their previous dwellings and workplaces in the General Government did not result in any serious political trouble. By contrast the Jews that lived in the East or were sent there by the Red rulers considered themselves essential bearers of Bolshevik ideals. Numerous Jews were avowed communist ac¬ tivists. Past experience certainly teaches us that focal points of unrest will remain even long after the military occupation of the Eastern territory. Acts of sabotage and terror will not just be incited and committed by communists who were not ar¬ rested during the latest purge. Rather, precisely the Jews will exploit every possi¬ bility to stir up trouble. Already the absolutely necessary, rapid pacification of the East requires the quickest possible elimination of disturbances during our con¬ structive work. ” The fact that the presumed order to exterminate the Jews was issued when the Polish campaign was already over in no way detracts from this conclusion, since the “pacification” was carried out regardless of the enemy, and that Jews are mentioned, not as Jews, but as supporters of Bolshevism. Even one of the principal witnesses confirming the existence of an extermina¬ tion order during the Einsatzgruppen trial, the Defendant Walter Blume, placed it within the framework of the struggle against Bolshevism:9 9 Interrogation of W. Blume on 13 January 1949. YVA, 0.53-141, p. 55. 34 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen “I have used the wording that is somehow stuck in my memory, that eastern Jewry was the intellectual reservoir of world Bolshevism, and that for this reason, a mil¬ itary victory over Russia would not mean the end of Bolshevism as long as eastern Jewry still existed. This is why Eastern Jewry must be destroyed. ” In this context, it is important to stress that, in the handling of the “Jewish ques¬ tion,” military necessity overrode ideological and political directives: the end goal of National-Socialist Jewish policy was the deportation or expulsion of Eu¬ ropean Jews to various regions above the Arctic Circle or at least beyond the Urals, but this policy also had to deal with the politico-ideological character and behavior of the Jews in the various geopolitical areas. 1.2. Structure of the Einsatzgruppen As is well known, the Einsatzgruppen consisted of four units designated A, B, C and D with a total strength of approximately 3,000 men. Einsatzsnippe A, with a documented strength of between 909 and 990 men (see further below), operated in the area of Army Group North, in the Reichskommis- sariat Ostland. It was commanded by SS Brigadefiihrer Walter Stahlecker (22 June 1941 - 23 March 1942), succeeded by: SS Brigadefiihrer Heinz Jost (29 or 30 March - 2 September 1942), SS Oberfiihrer Humbert Achamer-Pifrader (10 September 1942 - 4 September 1943), SS Oberfiihrer Friedrich Panzinger (4 September 1943 - May 1944) and SS Oberfiihrer Wilhelm Fuchs (May - October 1944). It was organized in four sub-units: - Sonderkommando (or Ein sa tzko m m a n d o ) la: commander SS StandartenfUhrer Martin Sandberger (appointed KdS10Estland on 3 Dec. 1941), operative area Estonia. - Sonderkommando (or Einsatzkommando ) lb: SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Erich Ehrlinger, then SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Eduard Strauch (from 3 Dec. 1941 until June 1943), followed by SS StandartenfUhrer Erich Isselhorst (from 30 June until October 1943), operative area Byelorussia. On 9 December 1941, Ehrlinger was appointed by Heydrich, representing Himmler, “Commander of the Security Police and the SD for the General Dis¬ trict Kiev in the Reichskommissariat Ukraine.”11 - Einsatzkommando 2: SS StandartenfUhrer Rudolf Batz (1 June - 4 Nov. 1941), replaced by SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Eduard Strauch (4 November - 3 December 1941) and by SS Sturmbannjuhrer Erwin Rudolf Lange (from 3 December 1941 until October 1944), appointed KdS Lettland on 3 December 1941; operative area Latvia. 10 Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei, commander of security police 11 NARA, T-175/240, 2729887, Der Reichsfiihrer-SS und Chef der Deutschen Polizei im Reichsministe- rium des Innem, Schnellbrief (express letter) dated 9 December 1941. Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 35 - Einsatzkommando 3: SS Standartenfuhrer Karl Jager, who then became KdS Litauen; Wilhelm Fuchs (15 September 1943 - 6 May 1944), and finally Flans Joachim Bohme (11 May 1944 - 1 January 1945); operations area Lithuania. Einscitz.gnippe B had approximately 665 members; it was commanded by SS Bri- gadefiihrer Arthur Nebe until the end of October 1941, followed by SS Bri- gadefiihrer Erich Naumann (beginning of November 1941 - March 1943), SS Standartenfiihrer Horst Bohme (12 March - 28 August 1943), SS Obersturm¬ bannfuhrer Erich Ehrlinger (28 August 1943 - April 1944), SS Standartenfuhrer Heinz Seetzen (28 April 1944 - August 1944) and once again by Horst Bohme (from 12 August 1944). This unit operated in Byelorussia, in the area assigned to the Army Group Central, and was sub-divided into: - Sonderkommando 7a: SS Standartenfuhrer Walter Blurne (until September 1941) , SS Standartenfiihrer Eugen Steimle (September - December 1941), SS Hauptsturmjuhrer Kurt Matschke (10 December 1941 - 29 February 1942), SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Albert Rapp (February 1942 - 28 January 1943), SS Obersturmbannftihrer Helmut Loos (June 1943 - June 1944), SS Sturm¬ bannfuhrer Gerhard Bast (June - November 1944). - Sonderkommando 7b: SS Sturmbannfuhrer Gunther Rausch (until February 1942) , SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Adolf Ott (mid-February 1942 - January 1943, replaced between July and October 1942 by SS Sturmbannfuhrer Josef Auinger), SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Karl Rabe (January 1943 - October 1944). - Einsatzkommando 8: SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Otto Bradfisch (until 1 April 1942), SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Heinz Richter (1 April - September 1942), SS Standartenfiihrer Erich Isselhorst (September - November 1942), and fi¬ nally SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Hans Schindhelm (13 November 1942 - Octo¬ ber 1943). - Einsatzkommando 9: SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Alfred Filbert (until 20 Octo¬ ber 1941), SS Sturmbannfuhrer Oswald Schafer (October 1941 - February 1942) , SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Wilhelm Wiebens (February 1942 - March 1943) , SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Friedrich Buchardt (January 1943 - March 1944) . - Vorkommando Moskau (Advance Unit Moscow): SS BrigadefUhrer Franz Six (until 20 August 1941), SS Sturmbannfuhrer Waldemar Klingelhofer (until December 1941), SS Sturmbannfuhrer Erich Korting (September - December 1941). In January 1942 this formation was merged with the Teiltrupp (sub¬ squad) of SS ObersturmfUhrer Doling and became Sonderkommando 7c; the commanders were SS Standartenfiihrer Wilhelm Bock (December 1941 - mid- 1942), SS HauptsturmfUhrer Rudolf Sc h mucker (June - autumn 1942), SS Sturmbannfuhrer Wilhelm Bluhrn (autumn 1942 - July 1943) and SS Sturmbannfuhrer Wilhelm Eckardt (July - December 1943). 36 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen Einsatzgruppe C had a strength of 700-820 men and was active in Reichskommis- sariat Ukraine under Army Group South. It was led by SS Brigadefiihrer Otto Rasch (until the beginning of October 1941), followed by SS Gruppenfiihrer Max Thomas (October 1941 - 28 August 1943) and by SS Standartenfiihrer Horst Bohme (from 6 September 1943 until the end of March 1944). It consisted of: - Sonderkommando 4a: SS Standartenfiihrer Paul Blobel (until January 1942), SS Standartenfiihrer Erwin Weinmann (13 January - July 1942), SS Ober- sturmbannfiihrer Eugen Karl Steimle (August 1942 - 15 January 1943) and SS Sturmbannfiihrer Theodor Christensen (January - end of 1943). - Sonderkommando 4b: SS Sturmbannfiihrer Gunther Herrmann (until Septem¬ ber 1941), SS Sturmbannfiihrer Fritz Braune (1 October 1941 - mid-March 1942), SS Sturmbannfiihrer Walter Haensch (mid-March - July 1942), SS Obersturmbannfiihrer August Meier (July - November 1942), SS Obersturm- bannfiihrer Friedrich Suhr (November 1942 - August 1943), SS Sturmbann¬ fiihrer Walter Krause (August 1943 - January 1944). - Einsatzkommando 5: SS Brigadefiihrer Erwin Schulz (until the end of Sep¬ tember 1941), SS Obersturmbannfiihrer August Meier (end of September 1941 - January 1942). The unit was dissolved in January 1942. - Einsatzkommando 6: SS Standartenfiihrer Erhard Kroeger (until November 1941) , SS Sturmbannfiihrer Robert Mohr (November 1941 - September 1942) , SS Obersturmbannfiihrer Ernst Biberstein (September 1942 - May 1943) , SS Obersturmbannfiihrer Friedrich Suhr (August - November 1943). Einsatzgruppe D consisted of approximately 600 men and operated in the area of the 11th Army and the Rumanian army (Bessarabia, southern Ukraine, Crimea, Caucasus). It was commanded by SS Oberfiihrer Otto Ohlendorf (until June 1942), followed by SS Oberfiihrer Walter Bierkamp (July 1942 - July 1943). It consisted of: - Sonderkommando 10a: SS Standartenfiihrer Heinz Seetzen (until July 1942), SS Sturmbannfiihrer Kurt Christmann (1 August 1942 - July 1943). - Sonderkommando 10b: SS Sturmbannfiihrer Alois Persterer (until February 1943), SS Sturmbannfiihrer Eduard Jedamzik (until May 1943). -Sonderkommando 11a: SS Sturmbannfiihrer Paul Zapp (until July 1942), SS Sturmbannfiihrer Gerhard Bast (November - December 1942), SS Sturmbann¬ fiihrer Werner Hersmann (December 1942 - May 1943) -Sonderkommando lib: SS Obersturmbannfiihrer Hans Unglaube (until July 1941) , SS Sturmbannfiihrer Bruno Muller (July - October 1941), SS Sturm¬ bannfiihrer Werner Braune (July - October 1941), SS Sturmbannfiihrer Paul Schultz (September 1942 - February 1943). - Einsatzkommando 12: SS Obersturmbannfiihrer Gustav Noske (until February 1942) , SS Sturmbannfiihrer Erich Muller (February - October 1942), SS Obersturmbannfiihrer Gunther Herrmann (October 1942 - March 1943). Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 37 With the commencement of Operation Barbarossa, the position of Hohere SS und Polizeifiihrer (Higher SS and Police leader) in Russia was occupied by: - Russia North and Ostlcmd : SS Gruppenfiihrer Hans-Adolf Priitzmann, later replaced by SS Obergruppenfiihrer Friedrich Jeckeln; - Russia Central: SS Obergruppenfiihrer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski; - Russia South und Ukraine: SS Obergruppenfiihrer Friedrich Jeckeln, later re¬ placed by SS Gruppenfiihrer Hans-Adolf Priitzmann. The documents known as the first and second Stahlecker Reports contain two graphs describing the strength of Einsatzgruppe A dated 15 October 1941 12 and 1 February 194213 (see Documents 1.1.1 and 1.1.2). The following table places the related data side by side, so they can be compared easily: Table 1 15 October 1941 1 February 1942 Total strength 990 909 Regular police force 133 = 13,4% 134= 14.8% Female employees 13 = 1.3% 22 = 2.4% Emergency food services 53 = 5.8% Teletypist 3 = 0.8% 9 = 0.9% Radio operator 8 = 0.8% 23 = 2.5% Active Waffen-SS 340 = 34.4% 151 = 16.6% SS reservists 126 = 13.9% Drivers 172 = 17.4% 185 = 20.3% Administration oo II oo 26 = 2.9% Special envoys 3 = 0.3% SD 35 = 3.5% 37 = 4.1% Criminal police 41 =4.1% 55 = 6.1% State police 89 = 9.0% 85 = 9.4%. Interpreters 51 = 5.1% Auxiliary police 87 = 8.8% It is strange that the strength of this supposed extermination unit would be re¬ duced by 81 persons when there still remained much work to be done; at the same time, they increased the non-combatant forces and forces not directly linked to extermination: Female employees, teletypists, radio operators, drivers. No less strange is the disappearance of the 51 interpreters, who must have been indispensable, whatever the activities of the Einsatzgruppe. The first Stahlecker Report supplies an “Allocation plan for members of Ein¬ satzgruppe A among the Einsatzkommandos ”14 (see Document 1. 1.3.), the data of which is summarized in the following table: 12 RGVA, 500-4-93, Annex la, p. 144, “Gesamtstarke der Einsatzgruppe A.\" 13 RGVA, 500-4-92, p. 183. 14 RGVA, 500-4-93, Annex lb, p. 145. 38 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen Table 2 E.K. la E.K. lb E.K. 2 E.K. 3 Total strength 105 110 170 141 Female employees 1 - 0.9% 4 = 2.4% 1 = 0.1% Teletypist 4= 1.8% Radio operator 2= 1.9 1 = 0.9% 2= 1.2% 1 = 0.7% SS reservists 25 = 24% 26 = 23.7% 41 = 23.6% 32 = 22.9% drivers 23 = 22.1% 34 = 30.9% 50 = 29.4% 34 = 24.3% Administration 3 - 2.9% 2= 1.8% 4 = 2.4% 1 = 0.7% SD 8 = 7.8% 3 = 2.7% 8 = 4.8% 10 = 7% Criminal police 11 = 10.5% 6 = 5.4% 13 = 7.8% 10 = 7% State police 18 = 16.2% 12= 11% 26 = 15.6% 29 = 20.6% Interpreters 14= 13.7% 6 = 5.4% OO o II OO 8 = 5.6% Auxiliary police <N o o II o <N 15 = 10.5% The total number of men in the four Einsatzkommando s was 526. Which tasks were carried out by the remaining 464 is not clear, since the total strength of Ein- satzgruppe A was 990 men. According to the Activity Report ( Tdtigkeitsbericht ) of Einsatzgruppe B of 14 July 1941 relating to the period from 23 June - 13 July 1941, this unit had a strength of 521 men, allocated as follows (Angrick et al., Doc. 19, p. 58): Tal We 3 Leader Subunit leaders Men Drivers Total Staff 15 11 3 23 52 SK 7a 10 37 15 31 93 SK 7b 11 38 15 27 91 EK 8 13 53 27 48 141 EK 9 15 51 32 46 144 Total 64 190 92 175 521 To the above must be added the second company of Polizei-Ersatz-Battalion (Po¬ lice Substitute Battalion) 9 with 3 officers, 51 non-commissioned officers and 80 soldiers. A schema relating to the organization of the “Higher SS and Police Leader South” dated 18 August 1941 indicates the strength of the units of Einsatzgruppe C: Einsatzkommando 4a and 4b consisted of 160 men each, while Sonderkom- mando had 5 and 6,250 men each,15 a total of 820 men (see Document 1.1.4). Einsatzgruppe D consisted of 400-500 men and had approximately 170 vehi¬ cles at its disposal (TWC, Vol. IV, p. 205). Ohlendorf declared that the strength of the unit commanded by him amounted to 500 men, 200 of whom were drivers (TWC, Vol. X, p. 1278). 15 YVA, 0.53-131, p. 14. Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 39 In addition to the Einsatzgruppen , other SS units, some of which were numer¬ ically larger, participated in operations in the eastern territories occupied by the Germans. Starting at the end of July 1941, the three “Higher SS and Police leaders” (“ Hohere SS- und Polizei-Fuhrern) each disposed of three police battalions, pre¬ cisely: - HSSPF Nord (North): Polizeibataillon 53, 319, 321 - HSSPF Mitte (Center): Polizeibataillon 307, 316, 322 - HSSPF Slid (South): Polizeibataillon 45, 303, 314. The total strength of this battalion was 8,000-9,000 men (Curilla 2006, pp. 97f.). The Kommandostab Reichsfiihrer SS consisted of the following units: - Begleit-Bataillon Reichsfiihrer SS - S S - F re i w i i I i gen -S tandartc Hamburg - SS-Flak-Abteilung “Ost” - SS-Kavallerie Brigade - 1. SS-Infanterie Brigade - 2. SS-Infanterie Brigade. The strength of these units, according to Yehoshua Biichler, was 25,000 soldiers (Biichler, p. 14). 1.3. Missions of the Einsatzgruppen The “Fact sheet for the leaders of the Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos of the Security Police and SD for Operation ‘Barbarossa,’” drawn up according to the order of the Wehrmacht High Command dated 26 March 1941, lists the mis¬ sions of the Einsatzgruppen as follows:16 “ a ) Non-combat zone of the Army operational area: Securing objects predetermined prior to commencement of the operation (materi¬ als, archives, cardfiles of organizations, units, groups, etc. that are hostile to the Reich or [German] state) as well as particularly important individual persons (leading emigrants, saboteurs, terrorists, etc.). [...] h) Non-combat zone of the Armed Forces operational area Investigation and combating efforts hostile to the [German] State and Reich, inso¬ far as not incorporated into the hostile army, as well as general briefing of the commanders in the non-combat zone of the armed forces operational area as to the political situation. ” Point 8, headlined “Arrests, Searches and Confiscations” prescribed: “Upon every arrest, a form from the issued Arrests’ form book is to be completed with 2 copies. The original copy and 1st carbon copy are to be forwarded to the leader of the Einsatzkommando; he has to send it to the Einsatzgruppe using the 16 YVA, 0.53-1, pp. 1-5. 40 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen most expeditious method. The carbon copy should remain with the Einsatzkom- mando, while the 2nd carbon copy should remain in the form book, which is to be given to the leader of the Einsatzkommando once used up. Upon every confiscation, seizure, search, etc., a form taken from the issued ‘Searches’ form book is to be completed with 2 carbon copies; the procedure is otherwise identical to that followed in connection with arrests. The delivery of confiscated objects is to be certified by the recipient agency on the 2nd carbon copy of the search report. Particular care is to be taken in the proper storage and securing of confiscated objects. ” Point 12, “General Behavior,” required impeccable behavior: “All members of the Security Police and SD are to be repeatedly instructed in the most emphatic terms, including the threat of severe punishment, to maintain im¬ peccable, disciplined, soldierly conduct. The mission requires the strictest disci¬ pline on the part of both leaders and men, both on duty and off duty. Official du¬ ties also include the maintenance of health and working strength. Any inordinate use of alcoholic beverages and neglect of duty under the influence of alcohol are to be prevented by immediate intervention. Personal relationships with the non- German population are prohibited; particularly, all contacts with women of other races are to be considered an offense against discipline and German honor. ” Point 15, “War Diary,” says: “From the very outset of the mission, the leaders of the Einsatzgruppen and Ein- satzkommandos are to keep a continual war diary, in which all important inci¬ dents and observations which may be of importance and/or interest in the future are to be noted chronologically. Care must be taken to ensure safe storage of all war diarys. ” The various reports drawn up by the Einsatzgruppen show that these units had executive and informational responsibilities. The executive responsibilities were both negative and positive in character. The negative aspect was the capture, identification and elimination of all those who were considered ideological and political enemies or who committed hostile acts against German troops or the populations of the occupied countries, starting with the partisans. However, as stated by the Danish researcher Therkel Strasde, the executive tasks did not initially contemplate mass executions, because (Strrede, p. 27): “when the German police forces moved into Soviet territory in June 1941 they did not have a standard procedure for mass executions like this one, although the mass shooting of civilians and POWs had already been exercised during the Polish campaign in 1939. No detailed orders specifying the organizational and technical details of such massacres were handed out, and it is obvious from actual variations in the ways they were carried out that the methodology of mass killing was to a large extent left up to the commanders of the authorities and units to de¬ cide. ” Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 41 The positive aspect consisted of the restoration of the administrative, social and economic structure of regions devastated by the Soviets during their withdrawal or by the combatants. Ohlendorf, in his deposition at the Einsatzgruppen Trial (October 1947), pro¬ vided a good explanation of what this aspect consisted of (TWC, Vol. IV, pp. 25 2f.): “First, the Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos never had the task to eliminate groups of the population because they were racially inferior, and even so that was not the main task. It was an additional assignment which, in itself, was foreign to the actual task of the Einsatzgruppen and Einsatzkommandos, because never was such a task of the security police or of the SD for that matter — and never by any means, as it is mentioned in another place in the indictment were they trained for such exterminations and executions. Rather, the general task of the Einsatzgruppen and the Einsatzkommandos was that the security of the army territory in the operational theaters should be guar¬ anteed by them, and within the framework of this security task the execution order was, of course, one of the basic orders. But, in reality, the Einsatzgruppen 's task was a positive one, if I leave out this basic order for exterminations and execu¬ tions. It must be realized, of course, that a group of about 500 people who, on the average, had charge of an area of 300 to 400 square kilometers, could not terror¬ ize such an area, even if they had wanted to do so. Therefore, if we regard it intel¬ ligently these tasks could only be called positive ones, and as such they were de¬ veloped by myself. The first experiences 1 collected was when the task was transferred to us by the army to harvest the overdue crop in the Trans[n\\istria. The larger number of Kommandos for weeks dealt only with this one task of harvesting in Trans[n\\is- tria; I had given orders for this measure which was the basis of my policy alto¬ gether. First, the institution of a self-administration, as it were, in the communi¬ ties and the communal settlements, and also in the municipalities; secondly, a recognition of private property; thirdly, the payment of wages the population re¬ ceived for each fifth sheaf of the entire harvest. I guaranteed this wage, even to the Rumanian authorities. Fourth, cultural places were restored that is, the popu¬ lation was supported in restoring the cultural centers and they were inspired to take up a new cultural life. It is not for me now to describe or discuss the success which this had with the populations of such places. I can only state that because of these measures the population was on our side, and they themselves reported any disturbances which might happen in these territories. Therefore, by this posi¬ tive winning over of the population, the security of the territory internally could be guaranteed, and actually, in our territory a partisan resistance movement did not come into existence, but it was formed by external elements and was artificial¬ ly extended. ” Such activity is attested to by the very Einsatzgruppen reports themselves. For example, as early as EM No. 21 dated 13 July 1941, Einsatzgruppe B reported as follows (Mallmann 201 1 et al., p. 1 13): 42 Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen “Dr. Tumash and his staff are endeavoring, as their most urgent tasks, to secure the food supply of the city population, to reintegrate the able-bodied population into the labor force by way of an employment agency, and to put the rural popula¬ tion back on the land which had migrated into the cities under Bolshevik pressure since 1928. ” At the beginning of August 1941, Einsatzgruppe B was engaged, among other things, in administrative activities and reconstruction measures (ibid., p. 235): “In all the localities and cities with which the Einsatzgruppen had any contact, temporary administrations were set up, in some cases by armed-forces units, in other cases by the Einsatzgruppen themselves, with the help of Byelorussian emi¬ grants brought in by the Einsatzgruppen [...]. These administrations concerned themselves primarily with securing the food situation, restoring economic life, registering all livestock, finding shelter for residents whose homes had been de¬ stroyed, and even creating ghettos in this context. ” The reconstruction measures even included a religious aspect. For example, on 6 August 1941, SS Sturmbannfuhrer Karl Tschierschky sent the following radio message to the RSHA (Angrick, et al.. Doc. 38, p. 95): “Einsatzgruppe A, with the consent of Army Group North, has helped supply the occupied former Soviet-Russian territory with Orthodox priests, who are to begin caring for the spiritual needs of the Russian population in the next few days. ” Einsatzbefehl (mission order) No. 10, issued by Fleydrich on 16 August 1941, which had as its subject “Handling of ecclesiastical issues in the occupied territo¬ ries of the Soviet Union,” shows that in this field, the greatest concern of the Germans was political in nature. It was necessary to prevent attempts by the Catholic Church to exert an influence over the occupied territories of the Soviet Union, because this would have reestablished contact with the Vatican. It was not even desired to support the Orthodox Church, but where the population had ex¬ pressed the desire for religious assistance and a priest was available, “the resump¬ tion of ecclesiastical activity” could be tolerated. The “living Church” should be kept under control, because it was not yet clear whether it was an organ of Soviet control. In the Baltic countries, the same principles applied with regal'd to the Evangelical churches: religious activity could only be permitted if it correspond¬ ed to a real desire on the part of the population (ibid.. Doc. 42, pp. 10 If.). The Einsatzgruppen were supposed to deal with this religious obstacle course as well. The informational tasks were those carried out institutionally by the Security Services and regarded all spheres of life in the occupied territories, i.e., political, economic, social, cultural, racial, religious, commercial matters, etc. These tasks also included the gathering of important documents. This task was referred to in a radio message from the RSHA IV A 1 to the Einzatzgruppen on 1 August 1941 with the subject “Procurement of Illustrative Material.” Gestapo Chief Heinrich Muller made the following request (ibid.. Doc. 32, p. 86): “Ongoing reports on the work of the Einsatzgruppen in the East must be present¬ ed to the Fiihrer from now on. Especially interesting illustrative material, such as Carlo Mattogno ■ The Einsatzgruppen 43 slides, posters, leaflets and other documents will be needed for this purpose. Inso¬ far as such material becomes available or can be procured, I request that it be forwarded by the fastest means possible. ” Muller’s concern shows that perhaps Hitler was not overly interested in mere numbers. The so-called first Stahlecker Report, that is, the “Overall report up to 15 Oc¬ tober 1941, ”17 shows the vastness of the tasks of the Einsatzgruppen. This is a 143-page letter with 18 appendices, including two duplicates, for a total of 221 pages. Only a very small paid is dedicated to the Jews, and only a very small paid relates to executions, that is, the paragraph “Struggle against Jewry”18 and the synopsis “Overview of the Number of Executions Carried Out until the Present,” while the paragraph “Jewish Influence over the Living Areas in the East” deals with historical, economic and historical matters. Among the annexes is a study of the structure of Soviet power in the past, a “Special Report on the GPU in Lat¬ via”19 and an “Overview of the Chief Agencies of the Estonian Socialist Soviet Republic.”20 The “Summary Report of 16 October - 31 January 1942” of Einsatzgruppe A for the period 16 October 1941 - 31 January 1942 (the second Stahlecker Re¬ port), an extremely long report of 228 pages plus 19 appendices, lists the various fields of its activity, corresponding to as many tasks as shown by the index: I.
