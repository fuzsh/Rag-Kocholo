        "text": "Racism has been the subject of considerable attention in recent years, and although many varieties of it have been identified and discussed, most of the discussions take insufficient account of the differences between the racial, ethnic, and national elements that play roles in it. 1 Nonetheless, the talk of racism against members of ethnic and national groups is quite common and gives rise to misunderstandings and confusions about what racism is and the various forms it can take when these differences are not explored. 2 In this article, I explore racism in the contexts of race, ethnicity, and nationality in order to determine whether it makes sense in those contexts and, if it does, the differences and similarities between them. I argue that understandings of racism that pay insufficient attention to the differences that characterize racism arising from considerations of race, ethnicity, and nationality stand on the way of its eradication and prevention. I further argue that conceptions of race, ethnicity, and nationality that attempt to integrate them into mixed notions can make matters worse. The article is divided into five sections. The first presents a general discussion of racism and its racial, ethnic, and national kinds. The second, third, and fourth examine in more depth racism based on race, racism based on ethnicity, and racism based on nationality. And the fifth presents some recent attempts to integrate race, ethnicity, and nationality that pay insufficient attention to their differences.\n\nThe article starts from the assumption that the slow and unsatisfactory development of case law concerning racism in Europe needs to be addressed engaging with wider political and policy developments that have shaped the silence about race and racism. I propose an analysis of political texts, reports and academic literature, developed since the mid-1980s, that approached the discussion and negotiation of legal provisions that prohibit racial discrimination. The analysis aims to unravel the reproduction of the mythical foundation of modern law that erases coloniality and institutional racism, that is, it erases the embeddedness of race in the formation of the West. In this context, racism is seen as an exteriority and a deviation and therefore, policy and legal provisions remain largely unscrutinised in their complicity with the reproduction of racism. Resumen El artículo parte del presupuesto de que el lento e insatisfactorio desarrollo de jurisprudencia relativa al racismo en Europa debe abordarse en diálogo con procesos políticos más amplios que han moldeado el silencio sobre la raza y el racismo. Propongo un análisis de textos e informes de carácter político y de literatura académica, desarrollados desde mediados de los años 80, que consideraron el debate y la negociación de provisiones jurídicas que prohibieran la discriminación racial. El análisis tiene como objeto desentrañar la reproducción de la fundación mítica del derecho moderno como narrativa que borra la colonialidad y el racismo institucional, esto es, borra lo racial como constitutivo de la formación de Occidente. En este contexto, el racismo se ve como una externalidad y una desviación y, por tanto, la complicidad de las provisiones políticas y jurídicas con la reproducción del racismo permanece, en gran medida, sin examinar.\n\nIt will be argued here that racism as we know it is a modern phenomena which is essentially used by ruling bodies to exercise control and entrench inequality over sections of society that are considered inferior, whether the inferiority is based on culture or physical attributes. Examples discussed illustrated the foundations of these ideologies and how their modern interpretations are applied through denial of individual human rights, social or political opportunities, by restricting or denying movement, or displaying outward expression of religious beliefs within a population\n\n‘Remarkable ... a major contribution to our understanding and handling of one of the crucial contemporary issues that acquires more gravity by the day.’ Zygmunt Bauman This is an in-depth sociological study of the phenomenon of anti-racism, as both political discourse and social movement practice in western Europe. Lentin develops a comparative study of anti-racism in Britain, France, Italy and Ireland. While ‘race’ and racism have been submitted to many profound analyses, anti-racism has often been dealt with as either the mere opposite of racism or as a theme for prescriptives or polemics by those concerned with the persistence of racist discrimination. By contrast, this book views anti-racism as a variety of discourses that are central to the understanding of the politics of modern states. Examining anti-racism gives us insights not only into current debates on citizenship, immigration and Europeanisation, but it also crucially assists us in understanding the nature of race, racism and racialisation themselves. At a time of mounting state racism against asylum seekers, migrants and refugees throughout Europe and beyond, this book provides a much-needed exploration of the discourse of anti-racism that shapes policy and public opinion today."
