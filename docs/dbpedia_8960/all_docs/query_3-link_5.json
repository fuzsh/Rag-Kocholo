They are to be watched. In addition they can be subjected to the following measures, among others: obligation to report daily, prohibition of moving, or assignment to specific dwelling, prohibition of leaving the municipal area limitations on circulation. In case of necessity they are to be taken into police custody until further decisions can be made.\n\nA Jew is, whoever descends from at least 3 grandparents who were full Jews by race. A Jew's\n\nalso whoever descends from one or two grandparents who were full Jews by race, if he\n\nbelongs or belonged to the Jewish denomination, or\n\non 20 June 1941 or later was married to, or living in common-law marriage with, a person\n\nwho is Jewish within the purview of these directives, or who now or in future enters into such a\n\nrelationship.\n\nIn cases of doubt, the district (or municipal) Commissar decides, according to his best\n\njudgment, who is a Jew within the purview of these directives.\n\nGeneral Commissars will immediately order the following measures, as soon as or insofar as\n\ncivil administration has been introduced in their areas :\n\nThe Jews are to be listed, through imposition of the duty to report, by name, sex, age,\n\nand address. Furthermore the rosters of Jewish congregations, and the statements of trustworthy\n\nnatives, will serve as bases for their listing.\n\nIt will be decreed that Jews distinctively mark themselves by prominently visible\n\nyellow hexagonal stars of at least 10 cm. in diameter worn on the left side of the, breast and in the\n\ncenter of the back.\n\nJews are prohibited from:\n\nChanging of their home town and their homes without permission of the area\n\n(municipal) Commissar.\n\nUse of sidewalks, public means of transportation (i.e., railroad, streetcars,\n\nbus, steamer, horse-drawn taxis) and automobiles\n\nUse of public facilities and institutions serving the population (resorts and\n\nbathing facilities, parks, meadows, playgrounds, and athletic fields).\n\nAttendance at theatres, movies, libraries, museums.\n\nAttendance at schools of any type.\n\nThe possession of automobiles and radio sets.\n\nKosher slaughtering.\n\nJewish doctors and dentists may treat or advise only Jewish patients. If Ghettos or\n\ncamps are erected, they are to be distributed among them for the care of their inmates. Jewish druggists are to be permitted practice of their profession according to need, but only in Ghettos or camps. Drug stores previously managed by Jews are to be transferred to trusteeship of Aryan druggists. Practice of their profession is prohibited to Jewish veterinarians.\n\nJews are to be forbidden exercise of the professions and activities designated below :\n\nActivity as attorney, notary-public or legal adviser.\n\nOperation of banks, money-changing offices and pawn shops.\n\nActivity as representative, agent, and intermediary.\n\nTrade in real estate.\n\nMigratory trade.\n\nThe following will be decreed for the handling of Jewish property :\n\nGeneral. The property of the Jewish population is to be confiscated and\n\nsecured. The previous Jewish legal owner, from the moment of confiscation, is\n\nno longer authorized to dispose of his property. Legal transactions which violate\n\nthis prohibition are null and void.\n\nDuty to report. The entire property of the Jewish population is to be reported.\n\nThe deadline for reporting is determined by the General or area Commissars. It\n\nis mandatory for anyone who owns or stores Jewish property and anyone who,\n\nwithout being owner, proprietor or custodian, legally or actually disposes of, or\n\ncan dispose of, Jewish property, to report it.\n\nThe duty to report not only applies to the legal Jewish owner, but also to\n\nanyone who, for example, administers Jewish property, who has taken it into\n\nsafe-keeping or obtained it in any other manner.\n\nThe reporting must be done on a form according to the attached model.\n\nThe General Commissars regulate reporting procedure with regard to local\n\nconditions and determine the officials to whom the reports are to be submitted.\n\nThe reports should be submitted, if possible, to the area commissars.\n\nThe area commissars are, however, empowered also to be in charge of the\n\ngiving out and the receiving of forms ;this applies also to government offices\n\nwhich are not supplied or equipped by the civil administration. These offices are\n\nto forward the forms handed in to the area Commissars.\n\nThe duty of delivery. Jewish property is to be delivered on special demand.\n\nThe demand can take place by general proclamation or by order to definite\n\nindividuals. The General Commissars order through proclamation immediate\n\ndelivery of the following articles:\n\nDomestic and foreign currency.\n\nSecurities and financial records of every sort,\n\n(i.e., stocks, promissory notes, exchange, debt records, bank and\n\nsavings-bank books)\n\nAll articles of value (coined and uncoined gold and silver, other\n\nprecious metals, jewelry, precious stones, etc.)\n\nArticles turned in are to be entered in a serially numbered receipt book in two\n\ncopies (carbon) according to the attached model. The entries are to be signed\n\nfor by the person delivering the article and by the receiving office. The carbon\n\ncopy of the entry is to be transmitted immediately by the receiving office to the\n\narea Commissar. The delivered articles are to be transmitted to the fund of the\n\narea Commissar and to be safeguarded by the latter. A special order will be\n\nissued on their utilization.\n\n4. On the Question of Subsistence: The Jewish population is left with the\n\nfollowing :\n\nThat portion of their household articles necessary for scanty\n\nsubsistence (furniture, clothing and linen)\n\nA daily amount of money 0.20 RNI (2 Rubles) for each Jewish member\n\nof the household, the amount of money for a month to be released in\n\nadvance.\n\nThe following further measures are to be emphatically striven for, with due consideration forlocal and especially economic conditions :\n\nJews are to be cleaned out from the countryside.\n\nThe Jews are to be removed from all trade, especially from trade with agricultural\n\nproducts and other foodstuffs.\n\nThe Jews are to be forbidden residence in resorts and spas, and in localities that are economically, militarily, or spiritually of importance.\n\nJews are to be concentrated, as much as feasible, in cities or in sections of large cities,whose population is already predominantly Jewish. Ghettos are to be established there,\n\nand the Jews are to be prohibited from leaving these Ghettos. In the Ghettos they are to\n\nbe given only as much food as the rest of the population can do without, but no more\n\nthan suffices for scanty nourishment of the Ghetto inmates. The same applies to supply\n\nwith other consumer goods. The inmates of the Ghetto regulate their internal\n\nconditions by self-administration which is supervised respectively by the city, area\n\nCommissar or his deputy. Jews can be assigned as police for internal order. They are to\n\nbe equipped with rubber truncheons or sticks at most and are to be distinguished by the\n\nwearing of the white arm bands, with the yellow Jewish Star on the right upper arm. For\n\nthe external hermetic sealing of the Ghettos, auxiliary police from among the natives\n\nare to be used as much as is feasible. Permission from the area Commissar must be\n\nobtained before anyone may enter the Ghetto.\n\nJews, capable of working, are to be drafted for forced labor according to the need for\n\nwork. The economic interests of natives worthy of assistance must not be interfered\n\nwith by Jewish forced labor. Forced labor can be performed in working parties outside\n\nthe Ghettos or in the Ghettos, or, where Ghettos are not yet established; also\n\nindividually outside (i.e., in the workshop of the Jew). Pay need not correspond to work\n\ndone; it need only correspond to the need for scanty subsistence for the forced laborer\n\nand the non-employable members of his family, taking due consideration to his present\n\ncash holdings. (cf. IV f 4 b) Those private establishments and persons, for whose account\n\nthe forced labor done, pay an appropriate fee to the pay office of the area Commissar\n\nwhich, in turn, disburses pay to the forced laborers. A special order will be issued for the\n\naccounting on amounts of money received.\n\nIt is left up to the General Commissars to order measures mentioned in par. 5 uniformly for their area or to turn over their promulgation in detail to the Area Commissars. Likewise the General\n\nCommissars are authorized to issue more detailed orders within the framework of this policy or to\n\nauthorize their area Commissars to do it."
