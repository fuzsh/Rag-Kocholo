It was during this year that the radicalization of Nazi policy—through both an all-encompassing approach to warfare and the application of genocidal practices—became most obvious. Germany’s military aggression and overtly ideological conduct, culminating in genocide against Soviet Jewry and the decimation of the Soviet population through planned starvation and brutal antipartisan policies, distinguished Operation Barbarossa—the code name for the German invasion of the Soviet Union—from all previous military campaigns in modern European history. This collection of essays, written by young scholars of seven different nationalities, provides readers with the most current interpretations of Germany’s military, economic, racial, and diplomatic policies in 1941. With its breadth and its thematic focus on total war, genocide, and radicalization, this volume fills a considerable gap in English-language literature on Germany’s war of annihilation against the Soviet Union and the radicalization of World War II during this critical year.\n\nNazi Policy on the Eastern Front, 1941 Total War, Genocide, and Radicalization\n\nEdited by\n\nAlex J.

The number of dead that it cost exceeded those of the other fronts several times over. The reason for this is to be found in a radicalization of warfare on the German side unparalleled in history, which was accompanied by a systematic breech of international law and resulted not least in the civilizational rupture of the genocide against the Jews. A decisive radicalizing thrust already occurred in the preparatory phase for the attack, between January and June 1941. At this point, Germany’s political and military leadership resolved to wage the war beyond all boundaries of international law. The conflict was to be fought unscrupulously in every sense; the elites of the USSR were to be decimated, large parts of the Soviet population left to starve to death, and the rest condemned to an existence as helots. Even if in this campaign, in the view of the chief of the Army General Staff, Generaloberst Halder, “the troops [must] also fight the struggle of ideologies,” it was still unclear on June 22 to what extent the conservative elites within the Wehrmacht, but also in the administration and the police, would support these radical policies or whether they would take advantage of the leeway remaining open to them to mitigate or even sabotage these policies. We now know that the latter option only occurred in exceptional cases. In many areas, the measures ordered were already in the first weeks radicalized beyond what had been planned, and not only as a result of further intensifying directives from the political and military leadership but also repeatedly on the initiative of mid- and lower-level authorities. The megalomaniacal aims and assumptions of the plan of attack led within only a few weeks to a self-created state of emergency, which—regardless of any ideological convictions—in turn created an understanding for\n\nKay.indd ix\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:44 PM\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\neven more radical solutions. In the case of anti-Jewish policy, this process led to the most terrible consequences. As early as 1976, Hans Mommsen identified the “cumulative radicalization” as a decisive trait of National Socialist policy. Historical scholarship has since shed light on this radicalization in various areas, though the entire radicalization process has yet to be systematically researched. The contributions in the present volume analyze a broad spectrum of developments and decision-making processes in the war in the east: in the waging of war, the planning for the exploitation of the occupied territories at the command level, the exploitation at the level of a division, the currency policy in the occupied east, the occupation policy and the policy of extermination toward Jews and Roma. The articles neither aim to nor can they substitute a systematic examination of the issue of cumulative radicalization, but they do contribute important material to this topic, many of them in an outstanding fashion. It is to be hoped that these stimuli will be taken up in further works on the subject. The successful cooperation of eleven young historians from seven nations—Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States—also calls attention to the fact that historians from the successor states to the Soviet Union have so far contributed few trendsetting impulses toward research into a war that brought such a degree of suffering to the peoples of the Soviet Union. —Translated from the German by Alex J. Kay\n\nKay.indd x\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:45 PM\n\nIntroduction Alex J. Kay, Jeff Rutherford, and David Stahel\n\nThe year 1941 was a turning point both in the course of World War II and in the scope and magnitude of National Socialist Germany’s policies. At the beginning of the year, Germany dominated continental Europe, having defeated the French in a stunning six-week campaign while at the same time forcing British troops to beat a hasty retreat back across the English Channel. To many contemporaries, it seemed as if the German army, utilizing a new doctrine of war termed “Blitzkrieg,” was unstoppable. If Germany began 1941 in such a powerful position, however, it ended the year militarily on the back foot, waging a two-front, truly global war, its human and material resources severely stretched. It is during these twelve months that the radicalization of Nazi policy, both in terms of an all-encompassing approach to warfare and the application of genocidal practices, can be seen most clearly. In this context, we understand the term “radicalization” to mean a willingness to contemplate, plan, and execute ever more extreme policies in order to achieve ever more far-reaching goals.1 This was already hinted at with the expansion of the conflict to the Balkans by means of the invasion and occupation of Greece and Yugoslavia. In the former territory, rapacious economic policies unleashed by the German authorities led to widespread starvation, centered on Athens.2 In Yugoslavia, the Wehrmacht itself initiated a brutal reprisal policy in which Jewish and Romani hostages were executed in “atonement” for partisan and other irregular attacks on army units and installations; within a year of the invasion, Serbia was declared judenfrei by the military authorities.3 Even these operations, however, paled in comparison to the nature of the war against the Soviet Union. Not only was there a radical difference in the scale and the scope of the killings on Soviet territory, but more importantly the mass killings in Serbia were, at least at the beginning, reactionary and not part of a\n\nKay.indd 1\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:45 PM\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nsystematic program of extermination. Furthermore, it was only after the German invasion of the Soviet Union that the mass murder of Serbian Jews under the cover of reprisals in fact began.4 The unprecedented scale of the invasion of the Soviet Union, which included not only an enormous military effort but also an unrestrained and blatantly ideological conduct of war that culminated in genocide against Soviet Jewry and the decimation of the Soviet population through planned starvation and brutal antipartisan policies, distinguished Operation Barbarossa—the code name for the German invasion of the Soviet Union—from all previous military campaigns in modern European history. The genocide against Soviet Jewry in turn played its part in the process leading to the separate though linked decision to expand the killing to Jews in the rest of German-occupied Europe. By the end of 1941, the first of the six extermination camps in occupied Poland had begun operating, though death by poison gas in vast industrial killing centers was only one of several methods used to annihilate Europe’s Jews. By this time, in fact, German units and their auxiliaries had already shot, clubbed, starved, and burnt to death as many as eight hundred thousand Jewish people in the occupied Soviet territories. On the home front, the magnitude of the Eastern campaign (and its continuation in the late autumn of 1941 following the realization that the Blitzkrieg had failed) quickly led to an overextension of the German economy to critical levels. Finally, 1941 ended with the expansion of the war beyond the European continent. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States and transformed the conflict into a global struggle. These are all pertinent examples of the radical evolution of Nazi policy over the course of 1941, and they serve to highlight the centrality of the Soviet territories in the development of Germany’s approach to the war. Indeed, it was first and foremost Germany’s decision to invade the Soviet Union that turned 1941 into the pivotal year of World War II. The invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 was what the late Andreas Hillgruber termed “Hitler’s true war.”5 Certainly, increasingly brutal combat and occupation practices that violated international law had already appeared during the first two years of war. The Wehrmacht’s invasion of Poland in 1939 and the subsequent partitioning of the country spoke to National Socialist population policies while simultaneously foreshadowing the increased levels of violence utilized by the German army and police forces in pacifying a given area.6 German atrocities and ruthless forms of repression clearly reflected the Nazi tolerance, and even encouragement, of violent methods.7 Even in the Western campaign, generally\n\nKay.indd 2\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:45 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nviewed as a Normalkrieg, German troops sporadically massacred black French colonial troops.8 In these early campaigns, however, such actions were frequently enacted as ad hoc measures on the ground or limited to very specific and narrowly defined groups, and were by no means approved of unanimously by Germany’s political and military leadership. Both the planning for and carrying out of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, by contrast, constituted not only a radical change in German policy, but also a watershed in modern European history. In both its unprecedented scale and unrivalled brutality, Operation Barbarossa stands as the focal point of World War II. The battles fought in the east were without comparison in the west until 1944. In 1941, the British Empire’s main military effort was focused on the three German and seven Italian divisions in North Africa that threatened Egypt. In contrast, the Soviet Union was attacked by 160 German divisions with well over half a million supporting troops from Finland and the Axis allies. Accordingly, throughout the middle years of the war in Europe (1941–43), the fighting on the Eastern Front assumed a dominant role, a fact that has not always been reflected in Anglo-American historiography. At the same time, Germany’s parallel pursuit of a so-called war of annihilation in the east, in which the occupied territory would best be pacified by “shooting anyone who even looks askance,”9 constituted its own watershed, fusing the racially inspired Nazi worldview with an environment where traditional legal norms counted for little or nothing. The circle of those targeted for removal in their entirety during the course of the war of annihilation in the east was constantly widened, both in the weeks and months prior to the military campaign being launched and in the aftermath of the invasion: the “Jewish-Bolshevik” intelligentsia, all Communist Party functionaries, everyone who demonstrated any form of passive or active resistance, all Jewish prisoners of war, Soviet Jewry root and branch. Radicalizing impulses emanated not only from above, from the center in Berlin, but also from below, on the ground in the killing fields of the east, as the incorporation of the Soviet politruks among the targeted victims of the notorious Commissar Order demonstrates, to cite just one example. Hundreds of thousands of Jews, as well as countless other Soviet civilians, fell victim to actions either carried out or incited by the occupying forces, especially during antipartisan raids that commenced mere days after the opening of hostilities, as well as to those led by local civilians who exploited the shift in the balance of power. This approach was soon applied to the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union and paved the way for the Continental-wide annihilation of European Jewry.\n\nKay.indd 3\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:46 PM\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe savagery of German security policies was complemented by an unprecedented campaign of exploitation in which some thirty million Soviet civilians were marked out for death by starvation to remove “useless eaters” and free up foodstuffs. The two largest victim groups in this respect were the Soviet urban population and Red Army soldiers taken prisoner. The siege of Leningrad and the subsequent horrors that occurred there on a daily basis during the winter of 1941/42, as well as the deaths of some 2.2 million Soviet prisoners of war by February 194210 have to be viewed within this context of economic thinking. This ravaging of the land was intended to provide Germany with the necessary resources to successfully fight a war of attrition against the Anglo-Saxon sea powers; the collapse of the home front that allegedly undermined imperial Germany’s war effort in 1918 was thus to be avoided at all costs under the Nazi regime. Between 1941 and 1944, the Eastern Front constituted, therefore, the foremost theater of military operations, as well as, conversely, both Germany’s principal hope for bolstering its economy and the main drain on German resources. The unexpected and—from the German viewpoint—unfavorable military developments in the east prevented German ambitions from being realized, while bleeding her armies white and weakening the Reich’s economic potential and strategic maneuverability. Despite all of this, the German-Soviet war in English-language historiography has followed a rather strange path. Due to the circumstances of the Cold War and the desire to integrate West Germany into the NATO bloc, early research into the savage war in the east frequently reduced it to purely operational histories. In these initial accounts, the German army’s brilliant armored operations conquered Ukraine, laid siege to Leningrad, and reached the gates of Moscow before being defeated by a combination of factors that lay outside of its control: Hitler’s interference in the conduct of the campaign; the weather, which alternately made the Soviet road network nothing more than a collection of muddy morasses and reduced the German army to a shivering mass of ill-clothed and illequipped men following the onset of winter; and finally, the overwhelming numbers of Soviet troops, who advanced in wave after wave, finally wearing down and halting the vaunted German Blitzkrieg.11 Operations received the lion’s share of attention in English-language historiography for two reasons. First, American and British political and military leaders had no experience of fighting the Red Army and sought to learn as much as possible about their new enemy. After all, the Germans had fought an extremely bloody war against the Soviet Union for nearly four years. Second, many of these works relied almost exclusively on the\n\nKay.indd 4\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:46 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nmemoirs and studies of former high-ranking German officers themselves. Obviously these men had very real reasons to obfuscate what had actually occurred during the war.12 Such works led many to conclude that the German army had fought an essentially clean war and that any atrocities that had taken place had been perpetrated by the political soldiers of the SS. The myth of an honorable German army took firm root in the collective mind of the Western world.13 While some German historians began to question the validity of such an approach during the 1960s and 1970s,14 English-language works examining German occupation policies in the east remained few and far between. Outside of Alexander Dallin’s pioneering work German Rule in Russia 1941–1945: A Study of Occupation Policies (first published in 1957) and Gerald Reitlinger’s The House Built on Sand: The Conflicts of German Policy in Russia 1939–1945 (first published in 1960),15 the most consequential works looking at the German experience of war on the Eastern Front were not published until the 1980s and 1990s. During this time period, Omer Bartov, Timothy Mulligan, and Theo Schulte produced important and innovative studies on the German army’s complicity in committing atrocities on the Eastern Front.16 New approaches to German occupation policy in the former Soviet Union have also more recently led to significant English-language works on both the occupation of Ukraine and the development of anti-Jewish policy in the Ukrainian region of Zhytomyr,17 as well as on political and economic planning for German occupation policy during the preinvasion period, with particular emphasis on the priority given to the ruthless seizure of Soviet foodstuffs.18 Increased focus on German antipartisan policy has furthermore led to new insights into another central aspect of the German war of annihilation directed against the Soviet Union and its population.19 While all of these works have led to a much greater awareness of the imperial war waged with unprecedented ferocity by the Nazi state and its allies against the Soviet Union, they remain, despite their quality, the exception to the rule. Once again, English-language historiography significantly trails that of Germany.20 Yet it would be inaccurate to suggest that German historiography leads the field in every respect. With the exception of Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg and work produced by historians at the Research Institute for Military History,21 the postwar German academic establishment has all but ignored military histories of the period, viewing operationally focused studies in particular as unworthy of serious attention.22 The aforementioned Anglo-American operational accounts emerging from the 1950s to the 1970s, with their inherent limitations,\n\nKay.indd 5\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:47 PM\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nhave still not been comprehensively replaced by new histories addressing the campaign from the German point of view. Indeed, our understanding of this aspect of the war would be particularly poorly served were it not for the work of historians studying the war from the Soviet perspective.23 It is these works that have provided a corrective in English-language historiography. As important as their insights have been in challenging the many myths established by the German postwar memoir literature, a great deal of work remains to be done concerning the German experience of war in the east. Beyond the inherent importance of considering what David Glantz has correctly identified as the many “forgotten battles” of the Eastern Front,24 there is also contemporary relevance in understanding the nature of Hitler’s war and the applicability of the notion of a “total war.”25 Nazi Germany famously adopted total war in the spring of 1943 with Joseph Goebbels’s speech in the Sportpalast, but in some ways this was only a formalization of what had already existed in Germany for years. The Hitler Youth and the Reich Labor Service included forms of paramilitary training, the war economy had made large inroads into the civilian sector, and not only did the state mobilize the domestic labor force, but it had also begun utilizing slave labor from its new empire. Yet total war also takes on another meaning, which can be applied just as equally to Germany’s war in the east. Released in 1935, Erich Ludendorff’s Der totale Krieg26 established a new benchmark in understanding war when he wrote that a future conflict should aim for the annihilation not only of the enemy army but also of the enemy nation. Essentially, Ludendorff was blurring the distinction between combatants and noncombatants, thus creating the precondition for unrestrained violence directed indiscriminately against a civilian populace. The book’s appearance merely publicized one strain of thinking that had developed within the German military leadership in the latter years of World War I and that became a significant influence on military thinking during the interwar period.27 Though the radical officers who advocated a synthetic meshing of Volkskrieg and mechanized war never saw their vision completely accepted by the highest levels of the German armed forces, the establishment of the Nazi state—one that also drew on the lessons of World War I, particularly concerning the importance of the home front in this age of industrial war—accelerated and even radicalized such thinking within the ranks of the Wehrmacht. While the violence directed against Polish and French society during the military campaigns of 1939 and 1940 never reached this level, the Barbarossa operation was indeed based on the concept of total war. The German military, as well as other Reich institutions, utilized\n\nKay.indd 6\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:47 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nany and all means to destroy both the Red Army and the society from which it had emerged. Ludendorff’s claim that “war and politics not only serve the survival of the people, but war is the highest expression of the racial will of life” certainly corresponded with the form of total war that drove Nazi policy in the east during 1941.28 Notwithstanding the lack of operational histories within German historiography, it remains the case that, during the past ten years or so, the German historical profession has produced extensive scholarship comprehensively exploring the political, economic, and ideological aspects of the German-Soviet war and the German occupation in particular. A new generation of historians such as Andrej Angrick, Christian Gerlach, Christian Hartmann, Johannes Hürter, Manfred Oldenburg, Christoph Rass, Dieter Pohl, Norbert Kunz, Felix Römer, and Bernhard Chiari, though not always in complete agreement, has advanced the state of existing knowledge concerning German occupation policy toward the Soviet Union in extremely important ways.29 Unfortunately, their work is almost entirely inaccessible for English-language audiences.30 The present volume aims to provide a bridge for English readers to the latest research on the German-Soviet war as well as present new perspectives with an emphasis on both the planning for the campaign and the first six months of the conflict itself. In light of the pivotal role played by the German invasion of the Soviet Union in the development and radicalization of Nazi policy, it should not be surprising that the essays in this collection reflect the inherent tendency toward ever more extreme aims and approaches, which quickly came to symbolize the German war in the east as well as signaling the future path that Hitler’s New Order in Europe would take. By focusing on the varied experiences of Nazi policy in the east, the volume illuminates the often diverse motivations and complex administrative structures that culminated in an increasingly ideological and violent occupation in the Soviet Union. This volume’s collection of young historians present findings based on both their own recent archival research and the most recent historiographical developments in the field. Viewed separately, essays on urban warfare, food policy, Criminal Orders, genocide, and military strategy may seem disparate; presented and analyzed together, however, they deliver a comprehensive exploration of fundamental German objectives on the Eastern Front in 1941 in a way that a single-focus monograph cannot. This collection derives its importance from its weaving together of eleven diverse topics and its exploration of the motivations driving branches of the National Socialist state apparatus toward total war and total destruction through eleven different lenses. The volume\n\nKay.indd 7\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:47 PM\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nalso provides an up-to-date English-language synthesis of recent research on the Eastern Front. The scholarship contained here is not only new and thematically germane, but it also offers an international perspective on the events of 1941. The contributors come from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and Israel. From the military standpoint, David Stahel examines the evolution of the strategic approach to the Soviet campaign as a solution to the unyielding resistance of the Red Army. Hitler’s war in the east was planned as a Blitzkrieg; major battles near the frontier were envisaged for the opening weeks of the war, but thereafter a rapid and relatively unopposed occupation of the western parts of the country was to follow. For this reason, fundamental differences of opinion between the Army High Command (OKH) and Hitler about the second phase of operations were allowed to pass unresolved during the planning phase. When the initial encirclements unexpectedly failed to break the back of Soviet resistance, the objectives for the second phase became a matter of vital importance. Toward the end of July, the increasingly heated debates became a strategic crisis as the generals of the OKH clashed openly with Hitler. At its root was the problem of how to defeat the Soviet state, but overshadowing the increasingly bitter disputes within the German command was the rapid exhaustion of the German panzer groups, upon which all future plans depended. The result was the failure of Operation Barbarossa, not in the autumn mud or early winter snow, but in the summer months of 1941. Adrian E. Wettstein investigates the development of the German army’s experience of urban warfare through an examination of changes at the tactical and strategic levels. The essay begins with an analysis of German experiences in urban fighting prior to Operation Barbarossa, especially during the 1939 campaign in Poland. With the opening of the campaign against the Soviet Union, German operations changed fundamentally. Ideologically and economically, Germany’s objective was to destroy most of the big cities and their inhabitants by starvation. Militarily, on the other hand, the Wehrmacht looked for a rapid victory over the Soviet Union in a Blitzkrieg. This strategy forced German troops to occupy those cities—simultaneously junctions of the thin Soviet transportation system—that were needed for a rapid advance as well as for the supply of the troops. These areas provided strong defensive positions against tank attacks and this dramatically slowed the unprepared German armored forces, which lacked the infantry needed to overcome Soviet resistance. In costly battles, German forces were ground down. This process is shown by examining the battle for Dnipropetrovsk (August/September 1941).\n\nKay.indd 8\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:48 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nAdditionally, the evolution of the Wehrmacht‘s urban warfare doctrine is examined in the case of Leningrad, where German plans for starvation and the deployment of poison gas reached new levels of barbarity during the modern period. Felix Römer’s contribution looks at the involvement of the German army in the political aspects of the German-Soviet war in the form of the so-called Criminal Orders. Given their major impact on the conduct of war on the Eastern Front, these orders refer first and foremost to the Commissar Order and the Barbarossa Martial Jurisdiction Decree. The Commissar Order stipulated that all political officers in the Red Army were to be shot on the spot should they fall into German hands, which meant nothing less than the systematic murder of regular prisoners of war. The Barbarossa Martial Jurisdiction Decree allowed collective reprisals against whole villages and enabled each and every German officer to decide about matters of life and death regarding Soviet civilians. Römer provides an overview of his recent, groundbreaking research on how German troops viewed and dealt with the Criminal Orders. For the very first time, the records of all German ground forces fighting in the Eastern campaign were analyzed, including those of all armies, corps, divisions, and regiments deployed against the Red Army in 1941–42. The vital importance within German objectives of the seizure of Soviet foodstuffs is reflected in the presence of two chapters on food policy in this volume, the first on high-level, preinvasion planning and the second on the implementation on the ground. Alex J. Kay’s essay addresses high-level planning during the first half of 1941 for securing foodstuffs. At the beginning of the year, members of the Reich Ministry for Food and Agriculture and the Reich Food Estate made concrete proposals to obtain large quantities of foodstuffs for the benefit of the Wehrmacht and the German home front from the soon-to-be-occupied Soviet territories. These so-called surpluses were in fact to be created by forcibly reducing the consumption of the Soviet population. Between then and the launch of the military campaign in June of that year, interaction between the ministerial bureaucracy, Wehrmacht departments, and the political leadership led to a radicalization of proposals to seize Soviet foodstuffs and the reaching of a consensus among those involved to the effect that around thirty million Soviet citizens would starve to death as a result of this concept. As Hitler expected his planning staffs to work around problems and find solutions to difficulties confronting them, pessimistic assessments during the period in question did not result in a rejection of these proposals on the basis of their anticipated terrible consequences (and indeed utopian nature), but rather in a widening of the parameters\n\nKay.indd 9\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:48 PM\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nof both what was acceptable and what was feasible, and, in this way, a radical departure from previous policy. The contribution from Jeff Rutherford also explores the role played by economic considerations in the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In order to realize its economic goals there, the Reich established the Economic Staff East to systematically exploit the Soviet state’s raw materials and natural resources. Once the invasion began, however, the economic authorities’ objectives were increasingly frustrated by the actions of the German army itself. During its advance on Leningrad in 1941, the 121st Infantry Division—in accordance with the Wehrmacht’s policy of living off the land—increasingly radicalized its food requisitioning, culminating in the organized plunder of the town of Pavlovsk. Such behavior hindered the Economic Staff East’s mission, leading to real tension and competition between the two institutions. In the end, however, Soviet civilians paid the ultimate price as they suffered widespread hunger and starvation as a result of the application of German food policies at the local level. Continuing the economic approach, Paolo Fonzi’s chapter focuses on the German currency and finance crisis of 1941. On the one hand, the Soviet territories occupied by the German army were expected to yield great resources for the Reich and thereby alleviate the burden of the war effort on the German population. On the other hand, the war in the east enormously increased the needs of the German war machine and, consequently, the financial expenses incurred by the German state. The perception of a looming financial crisis caused by the war effort spread in the months following the beginning of the Eastern campaign and was a main point of debate among German economic bureaucrats. In the same period, a discussion began concerning the foundation of emission banks in the former Soviet territories, which was strongly influenced by the debate on the financial crisis. Two opposing strategies confronted each other: the first aimed at increasing exploitation with monetary means to solve the German budgetary problem; the second believed that the extension of exploitation would lead to an imminent collapse of the currencies in the new territories and, in the long run, make it impossible to pursue a policy of exploitation. Fonzi’s contribution outlines this discussion and analyzes which principles were followed when the new Central Banks of Ukraine and Ostland were finally established. The extensive research carried out on Nazi decision making and the origins of the “Final Solution” has established beyond doubt that the Nazi Vernichtungskrieg against the Soviet Union coincided with the physical extermination of all Soviet Jews and other so-called undesirables, and that we can no longer study the military history of the eastern campaigns\n\nKay.indd 10\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:48 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nand occupation policies without their genocidal components. One largely unexplored subject in this context is the focus of Wendy Lower’s essay: Axis collaboration. Lower shows how Axis diplomacy and participation in the conquest and occupation of Soviet Ukraine contributed to the onset of the genocide. The diplomacy of the “Jewish Question” among Axis powers was an integral feature of Operation Barbarossa, which precipitated the Holocaust by mass shootings from Lviv to Kharkiv. Case studies of German collaboration with Hungarians, Romanians, and Slovakians reveal that perpetrator networks developed across occupation authorities and usually with local Ukrainians and ethnic Germans on hand to assist in the mass murder. The battles for Moscow and Stalingrad were major defeats for the Axis military, but in the rear areas of occupation another war against the nations or peoples of the Soviet Union, above all against the Jews, was advancing with success. This was the peace that Hitler and his non-German allies hoped to achieve in their racial reordering of Ukraine and the rest of Europe. As Nazi anti-Jewish policy did not proceed uniformly in the occupied Soviet territories, Leonid Rein offers a companion chapter to Lower’s on Ukraine by dealing with the radicalization of anti-Semitic measures in occupied Belarus in the course of 1941. This policy culminated in the total murder of virtually the entire Jewish population there. The persecution of Jews in Belarus began immediately with the isolation of the Jews and quickly progressed to outright murder. In the first two months of the German invasion, not only Jews in party and state positions but also entire Jewish male populations and sometimes even women and children were killed. August 1941 marked the transition to the systematic murder of entire Jewish communities. The expansion of the annihilation process manifested itself in ever-growing numbers of victims, in the widening of the circle of perpetrators, and also in the search for more effective killing methods, such as the gas van. By the end of 1941, practically the entire Jewish population of eastern Belarus and a large part of western Belarusian Jewry had already ceased to exist. Staying with occupation policy in Belarus, Stephan Lehnstaedt analyzes why and to what extent German everyday life in Minsk in 1941 differed from life in Warsaw between 1939 and 1941. In doing so, he demonstrates with a case study how much more “total” the German approach to occupation in the Soviet Union in 1941 was in comparison with occupation in Poland during the period 1939 to 1941. His chapter begins by outlining the occupation of Belarus, which has been the focus of recent German research but has hardly been addressed in Anglo-Saxon countries. The second part of the chapter addresses not only crimes in\n\nKay.indd 11\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:49 PM\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nMinsk and their perpetrators, but also aspects of their everyday life in the city. It demonstrates how the perception of the town and its inhabitants as well as the perception of their own situation influenced the attitude of the Herrenmenschen. Their behavior, including crimes such as looting, rape, and murder, is investigated in the third part of the chapter. In its final part, Lehnstaedt demonstrates that feelings of superiority toward the Jewish and Belarusian peoples on the one hand, and the sense of being part of a small, besieged group of comrades on the other hand, led— compared to Poland at the same time—to more extreme forms of everyday life in which violence and even mass murder became an accepted and somewhat “logical” mode of conduct for the state and for the individual. Addressing the much-neglected subject of the genocide perpetrated against Soviet Roma, Martin Holler considers the important role of Otto Ohlendorf, the commander of Einsatzgruppe D, in the radicalization of Nazi policy. As early as autumn 1941, units subordinate to Ohlendorf had already carried out the first mass shootings of Roma in the region of Nikolaev. The persecution in the Crimea took a particularly systematic course, where the extermination of “Gypsies” proceeded more or less parallel to the extermination of Jews and Krimchaks. In December 1941 the bigger cities of the peninsula, which had separate “Gypsy quarters,” were “cleansed.” By January 1942 the towns of Simferopol, Kerch, and Yevpatoria were considered to be zigeunerfrei (free of Gypsies). It is striking that, from the beginning, Ohlendorf’s Einsatzgruppe D did not differentiate between sedentary and so-called itinerant “Gypsies.” This approach differed from the other German-occupied Soviet territories, where the systematic obliteration of the whole Romani community did not begin until spring 1942. It is clear that Ohlendorf acted on his own authority when deciding to unite the fate of all Roma with that of Soviet Jewry. In doing so, the head of Einsatzgruppe D became to a certain extent the trailblazer for the complete “solution of the Gypsy question” on Soviet soil. Furthermore, it seems likely that his murderous activity influenced the decision-making process of the other Einsatzgruppen leaders in the sense that Ohlendorf’s formal transgressions were evidently in no way restricted, either by the Reich Security Main Office or the German military. Thomas J. Laub’s essay follows on from Stephan Lehnstaedt’s comparison of individual cities in Belarus and Poland by comparing aspects of Nazi policy vis-à-vis the Soviet Union with Western Europe, more specifically France. In doing so, he demonstrates that the operational and occupation policies pursued from the outset of Operation Barbarossa were not only far more severe and far reaching than anything that had gone before in France, but also that this very approach to the Soviet Union and\n\nKay.indd 12\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:49 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nits peoples led by the end of 1941 to policy in France becoming systematically more extreme. This affected the treatment of prisoners of war, reprisal measures against partisans and other members of the resistance, as well as the persecution of Jewish inhabitants of France. The development of Nazi policy in the east during 1941 set the tone for the remaining three and a half years of the war: the pointless battle of attrition that Germany could not win; the single-minded pursuit of Jews throughout occupied Europe and the murder of those ensnared by the regime; the exceedingly violent and arbitrary response to partisan activity, in which innocent civilians were murdered in lieu of actual guerrillas; and the ruthless confiscation of foodstuffs that eventually led to the spread of famine into areas of Western Europe, such as the Netherlands, in the war’s latter stages, were all phenomena witnessed on the Eastern Front in 1941. If Hitler and the German state stood at the pinnacle of their power as 1941 dawned, the Nazi regime found itself in a strategically untenable position as the curtain closed on the year. This collection of essays offers fresh appraisals of these fateful twelve months, a year that revealed just how far the Nazi regime was willing to go to achieve its terrible goals.\n\nNotes 1.

Casting a fleeting look at the respective strength of arms, experience, and professionalism of the Red Army and the Wehrmacht on the eve of Operation Barbarossa, one might be forgiven for thinking that on this occasion the ensuing war would indeed be very simple, even easy. Certainly many at the time thought so, yet deficient German planning and dogged Soviet resistance proved the virtue of Clausewitz’s maxim. Indeed, from its very inception Operation Barbarossa was a problematic enterprise based on poor intelligence and an erroneous understanding of warfare in eastern Europe. Hitler’s Ostheer (Eastern army) soon encountered problems, and a drastic cycle of improvisation forced a radicalization in tactical methods and strategic choices. At the tactical level, radicalization manifested itself in the increasingly arduous experience of warfare as dangerous materiel shortages, unceasing operational demands, and unprecedented losses overwhelmed units. At the strategic level, the radicalization stemmed from the failure of German plans to rapidly end Soviet resistance, leading to the command crisis over how best to continue the war. Certainly Hitler’s war in the east was in many ways unique, but in military terms the Wehrmacht’s problems were prefaced by past campaigns. In his biography of Charles XII of Sweden, Voltaire noted that “there is no ruler who, in reading the life of Charles XII, should not be cured of the folly of conquest.”2 Arguably the best example of Charles XII’s excesses in war was his invasion of Russia in 1708, which ended in disaster a year later at the battle of Poltava. Having invaded Russia from Poland with a formidable force marching toward Moscow, Charles’s plans soon unravelled as he diverted his hapless army into Ukraine. There it was supposed to secure\n\nKay.indd 19\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:52 PM\n\n20\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\nsupplies and wait out the winter before continuing in 1709. Yet Charles’s army withered and in the following year he was met by a reformed and numerically superior Russian opponent. At the pivotal battle of Poltava in June 1709, Charles’s campaign came to a disastrous end. The corrosive effects of operating a foreign army in the hostile expanses of the Russian steppe made defeat ever more likely.3 Assessing Charles XII’s ill-fated campaign one hundred years later, Napoleon Bonaparte ignored the dangers of sustaining an army in Russia and remained convinced that the Swedish king’s cardinal error was not taking Moscow, which he believed was the key to the whole campaign.4 Events were to prove the French emperor wrong. Napoleon took Moscow in his 1812 campaign, but it did him no good when the Russian tsar, Alexander I, refused to acknowledge defeat and simply continued the war. Confronting the grievous prospect of a winter deep inside Russia, Napoleon began his famous retreat, which ended in its own calamity. Yet the root of Napoleon’s demise was not his delayed departure from Moscow, nor the unforgiving intensity of the Russian winter. It was his flawed understanding of the eastern theater of war, which from the beginning shunned or thwarted many of Napoleon’s conventional conceptions of victory and conquest. A partial occupation was clearly insufficient to subdue Russia and yet its vast size hardly allowed for a more comprehensive subjugation. Time also favored the Russians, not simply because of the severe winter weather but also because of the high price to be paid by maintaining an army in the field. Throughout the march to Moscow in 1812 the Grande Armée lost men at a staggering rate. Indeed, advancing through the Russian theater was by far the single greatest peril for the armies of both Charles XII and Napoleon I. Diseases, exhaustion, heat stroke, dehydration, desertion, and even starvation cut swaths through the ranks and also decimated the vital horse population. Even Napoleon’s bloody encounter at Borodino was dwarfed by losses on the march. Accordingly, the campaign cannot be understood simply through the sum of its major battles, as those alone would suggest a French victory that belies the dwindling strength of the invader.5 By the time the French were encamped in Moscow, their unbeaten army had had its numerical superiority over the Russians slashed, and this was before the well-documented torments of their retreat. Clearly the bitter experiences of both Charles XII and Napoleon I set an ominous precedent for invaders of Russia. Assessing Clausewitz’s history of the 1812 campaign, Sir Michael Howard paraphrased the great strategist’s conclusion “that battles are rather won by attrition, the slow exhaustion of reserves, than by either skilful manoeuvres beloved of military theorists or the ‘shock’ so dear\n\nKay.indd 20\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:52 PM\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\n21\n\nto the hearts of fighting soldiers.”6 If this was true of Napoleon’s day, it certainly retained its merit in 1941. The attrition of the invading German army was seen both on the battlefield and on the march, but as with past conquerors, the German command was largely oblivious to its effects. The implications had a distinctly radicalizing effect in two key areas. At the strategic level, the premise of Operation Barbarossa’s success— eliminating Soviet resistance through large-scale encirclements close to the German-Soviet border—proved excessively optimistic and necessitated further operations. These would have to be conducted at an ever increasing depth with rapidly diminishing resources, but because such stolid faith had been placed in the initial success of the campaign, little planning and no agreement had been reached on the continuation of the war. By the end of July, the war was being improvised on a day-today basis as Hitler and his commanders openly fought each other over which plan promised to deliver the final blow. Nothing decisive had been achieved at Minsk in June when the first great pocket was closed, nor was it achieved at Smolensk in July, nor at Uman in August, nor at Kiev in September, and hence still more plans were required; this led to the campaign becoming increasingly radicalized as time went on, compounded by the strenuous demands of successive operations as well as the scope and scale of Soviet resistance. While the German command grappled with the unforeseen difficulties of finding an end to their war in the east, a parallel radicalization was taking place from below. At the tactical level, the severity of the combat and the remarkable rate of attrition among the German motorized forces led to a critical loss of momentum. This is made patently obvious from the war diaries and field reports of the panzer groups, but the problem remained a general one throughout the Ostheer. As operations extended, fallout rates grew to worrying levels, reducing the mobility, speed, and force with which offensive operations could be conducted. Taken together with the expanding funnel of the Soviet theater, Germany’s shortage of military units, and the high causalities being sustained, momentum inevitably waned. Worst of all, this radicalization at the lower echelons was poorly appreciated at the top, meaning that new operations were being planned without a realistic understanding of what the forces, especially the panzer groups, could achieve. While the radicalization of warfare in the east was a process that escalated throughout the summer and autumn of 1941, it was rooted in the planning of German operations and the many misconceptions upon which this was based. In the same dismissive manner that Napoleon rejected the experiences of Charles XII’s ill-fated campaign, so too did\n\nKay.indd 21\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:53 PM\n\n22\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\nHitler and his military commanders ignore 1812. Trusting in 129 years of technological advancement, as well as their own delusional notions of German racial superiority, the German command was remarkably impervious to doubts. The first serious discussion of a campaign against the Soviet Union came in the weeks following the astonishingly successful French campaign, which served to propagate the myth of German invincibility, first as a propaganda tool, but then as a widely embraced, selfstyling image, readily adopted in the minds of the Nazi and Wehrmacht elite.7 The grinding battles of the western front in World War I had now been overtaken by the power of technical innovation, restoring mobility to the battlefield and recovering the notion that bold operational maneuvers, accompanied by shock panzer tactics, could break even the strongest armies. Utilizing this formula, none of Hitler’s senior commanders in the OKW (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht—High Command of the Armed Forces) or the OKH (Oberkommando des Heeres—Army High Command) doubted the outcome of a war against the Soviet Union.8 As in Napoleon’s case, the issue was not whether the Soviet armies could be defeated, but only a matter of how best to achieve that end. Accordingly, the German command paid only the most cursory attention to the unique problems of the Soviet theater and the difficulties that would arise from attempting deep mobile operations into its vast hinterland. The first operational study for the OKH was produced by Generalmajor Erich Marcks and appeared only days after being commissioned. Astonishingly, no submissions on feasibility were sought from the army quartermaster general, and much of the information at Marcks’s disposal was either dated or highly dubious. From the beginning it was simply assumed that the strategic objectives of the campaign could be met and that any difficulties would be ironed out at future stages of planning or by the field commanders during the campaign itself. Another operational study by Oberstleutnant Bernhard von Lossberg for the OKW concluded with similar results.9 Thus, from its inception, the campaign’s viability from a military point of view was regarded as absolute, and future planning was directed on that basis. Not surprisingly, such a dangerous premise left prodigious inconsistencies between what was being ordered and what was possible. For example, in November 1940 when the chief of the Army General Staff, Generaloberst Franz Halder, met with the army quartermaster general, Generalmajor Eduard Wagner, to discuss planning for the logistical support of the operation, Wagner’s damning conclusions essentially undercut the basis of the whole invasion plan. Based on the premise of keeping some two million men, three hundred thousand horses, and five hundred thousand motor-vehicles supplied, Wagner\n\nKay.indd 22\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:53 PM\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\n23\n\nfrankly assessed that a maximum advance of between seven hundred and eight hundred kilometers would be possible. Such a distance was inconsistent with the objectives being assigned to the Army Groups, which in any case did not take into account the newly developed industrial zones in Siberia or the fact that the German invasion force would be far larger than Wagner anticipated.10 Moreover, Wagner told Halder that supplies of foodstuffs and ammunition would suffice for only the first twenty days of the campaign.11 Intelligence about the Red Army was another key failure; Germany grossly underestimated the imposing size of the Soviet Union’s mobilization base, the quality of its weapons, and the robustness of its armaments industry. Though evidence to the contrary was at hand, it was simply not appreciated.12 Thus, impervious to any doubts, Hitler, the OKW, and the OKH retained an indomitable faith in the success of Operation Barbarossa. The OKH was charged with coordinating and conducting the war in the east, for which it set clear objectives. Army Group North would be directed toward Leningrad, Army Group Center to Moscow, and Army Group South toward the resource-rich Don Basin in eastern Ukraine. Reaching these distant objectives did not trouble the OKH, because it was firmly believed that in the initial border battles the bulk of the Red Army would be encircled and destroyed. The commander in chief of the army, Generalfeldmarschall Walther von Brauchitsch, gave a blunt assessment of the coming war in the east. Speaking in April 1941, Brauchitsch stated: “Fierce border battles anticipated, duration up to four weeks. Afterwards, only minor resistance is to be expected.”13 The emphasis was clearly on striking a decisive initial blow to cripple the Red Army and expose the rest of the country to occupation without large-scale fighting. With the Eastern campaign expected to be both short and relatively trouble free, the OKH did not wish to confront Hitler directly when the dictator began to suggest that in the second phase of operations, after the initial encirclements, Army Group Center would swing north and march together with Army Group North on Leningrad. Hitler wanted to strike hard at the city he saw as the cradle of bolshevism and the ideological impetus behind the whole Soviet state. Halder and Brauchitsch did not agree. They wanted to use Army Group Center, which was by far the most powerful of the three invading army groups, against Moscow, as they believed the capital represented the linchpin of Soviet power. When this divergence of opinion first surfaced during a command conference on December 5, 1940, Halder was careful not to challenge Hitler directly over the matter and instead allowed it to pass without confrontation.14 Hitler remained oblivious to the OKH’s disaffection, to which he would\n\nKay.indd 23\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:54 PM\n\n24\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\nnot have reacted well given their recent history of heated disagreement over plans for the attack in the west. Perhaps it was for those same reasons that Halder and Brauchitsch opted against open dissent and instead adopted a course of silent duplicity, deferring to Hitler’s view when in his presence, yet all the while informing Army Group Center’s field commanders that they would be taking the road to Moscow. Conceivably, Halder calculated that the weight of the German blow would render arguments over a second phase redundant and, with the back of the Red Army broken, nothing would stop the German advance in all directions.15 In any case, throughout the planning stages there was a stark difference of opinion between the OKH and Hitler as to the continuation of the war after the initial battles. According to Generalleutnant Friedrich Paulus, there existed “a sharp divergence of opinion between Supreme Headquarters (Hitler) and the Army General Staff regarding both the manner in which the operations should be conducted and the intermediate objectives that should be set.”16 Nor was the divergence limited to Leningrad. At the last major military conference, just a week before the invasion, Hitler made reference to the large Soviet concentrations in front of Army Group Center and then informed his audience, including Halder and Brauchitsch, that once these had been defeated Army Group Center would also have to reinforce Army Group South. Observing events, Hitler’s Luftwaffe adjutant, Nicolaus von Below, noted that neither Halder or Brauchitsch raised a word of protest, yet Below suspected that the curious absence of discussion disguised a deeper friction. Summing up his observations over the preceding months, Below concluded: I had observed on various occasions an oppositional stance by Halder to Hitler’s judgments and instructions, without the general voicing his differing views. I had the impression that Halder was forever eating something he didn’t like, but swallowed anyway. Thus we embarked upon a truly massive offensive with a disjoined leadership and with leaders pulling in different directions. I saw this as a great danger for the success of the operation.17\n\nThe true extent of Below’s ominous prescience when it came to Operation Barbarossa’s lack of success must remain in question, but there is no doubt about the OKH’s rejection of Hitler’s plans, nor its attempt to circumvent his authority. Writing after the war, the commander of Panzer Group 3 in Army Group Center, Generaloberst Hermann Hoth, noted that “within Panzer Group 3 itself, everyone was driven by the thought that they were on the way to Moscow. One must understand, if the commander in chief of the army [Brauchitsch] would have been\n\nKay.indd 24\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:54 PM\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\n25\n\ndetermined to fulfill Hitler’s wishes, he would have informed the commander of the troops.”18 With the field commanders believing they were headed to Moscow, the generals at the OKH had to tread carefully. Halder and Brauchitsch had already experienced the futility of trying to forcefully change Hitler’s mind, and the dictator bitterly resented them for having attempted to do so. Thus, they now tactfully adopted a more subtle approach. Their silence at the conference table prevented any formal commitment to Hitler’s plans; at the same time it kept relations on a positive footing and earned them a revived measure of Hitler’s confidence. When the campaign began Halder intended to use his position, as well as his improved standing, to supply Hitler with all the evidence that might result in a continued advance on Moscow. Only with the failure of this more subtle approach would more confrontational measures have to be contemplated. In spite of their differences over strategy, the German command was firmly united by an ardent belief in victory. When the war began the most vital sector for the Germans was Generalfeldmarschall Fedor von Bock’s Army Group Center. Here the Germans had concentrated two-thirds of their panzer strength19 and the best elements of the Luftwaffe. These were the critical formations upon which much of the success of the campaign depended. The first strategic encirclement was closed in the area of Minsk, trapping the bulk of the Soviet Western Front in a giant caldron and effectively shattering the Soviet line. Feeling entirely justified in his predictions of a rapid victory, Halder recorded in his diary on July 3: On the whole one can already now say that the objective to destroy the mass of the Russian army in front of the Dvina and Dnieper [rivers] has been accomplished. I do not doubt . . . that eastward of the Dvina and Dnieper we would only have to contend with partial enemy forces, not strong enough to hinder the realization of the German operational plan. Thus it is probably not an exaggeration when I claim that the campaign against Russia was won within fourteen days.20\n\nOn July 8, 1941, Army Group Center announced a figure of almost three hundred thousand Soviet POWs.21 To the German command it was a modern-day Cannae and the harbinger of outright victory. The idea that the Red Army might patch up its front with reserves appeared absurd; and Bock’s panzer groups were already continuing their advance eastward to cross the last defensive line anchored on the great rivers. Although on the surface operations seemed to be going according to plan, there were many misconceptions about both the state of the Red Army and the capacity of the panzer groups to maintain their speed and\n\nKay.indd 25\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:54 PM\n\n26\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\npower into the depths of the Soviet hinterland. Contrary to popular belief, the Soviet Western Front was not destroyed in the battle of Minsk. Soviet prewar planning called for a first strategic echelon, deployed between twenty and one hundred kilometers from the border, to counterattack and stop the enemy advance in order to facilitate a general Soviet offensive carried out by a second strategic echelon located well back from the frontier between one hundred and four hundred kilometers away.22 Of even greater importance was the capacity of the Soviet Union to quickly raise reserves. On the eve of the German invasion, the Red Army possessed a mobilization base of some 14 million men. Only a week into the war some 5.3 million Soviet reservists had been called up, with further mobilizations following in succession. In July 1941 no less than thirteen new field armies appeared and in August another fourteen came into service.23 Thus, while the Red Army certainly suffered appalling casualties at Minsk, the Soviet Union’s force generation scheme was able to quickly replace its losses and dramatically expand the size of the Red Army.24 On June 22, 1941, the Red Army numbered 5,373,000 men. By August 31, in spite of its losses, it had grown to 6,889,000 men, and by December 31, 1941, the army had reached an estimated 8 million men.25 On the other side, the linchpin of Germany’s offensive success—the panzer groups—were suffering from an unsustainable rate of attrition. In the same way that Napoleon’s army withered on the march through Russia, so too did the motorized divisions. Only six days into the campaign, the 7th Panzer Division, spearheading Hoth’s thrust north of Minsk, reported a hefty 50 percent loss in its Mark II and Mark III tanks, while the Mark IV tanks had suffered 75 percent losses.26 The fallout rate proved so high that the 7th Panzer Division could no longer obtain its objective and had to ask for reinforcements from the nearby 20th Panzer Division.27 Nor was this an isolated problem. Two weeks into the campaign, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian’s Panzer Group 2 reported an alarming rate of attrition in its divisions, which was eroding force strengths to critical levels. On July 7, the 18th and 3rd Panzer Divisions were at just 35 percent combat readiness; the 4th and 17th Panzer Divisions were at 60 percent strength; while the 10th Panzer Division, which had been in reserve, was strongest at 80 percent.28 Such figures did not bode well given the enormous distances still to be traversed and the extent of Soviet reserves. Most of the losses were due to mechanical failure; while repairs were certainly possible, it would require precious time and the replacement parts were extremely limited. Moreover, as the advance continued, the number of tanks returned to service would constantly be offset by the continuing fallout rate. Indeed, the terrible\n\nKay.indd 26\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:55 PM\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\n27\n\nroad conditions constituted the single greatest impediment to the advancing panzer divisions, but it would also be wrong to dismiss the effect of Soviet resistance. In an ambush north of Zhlobin, twenty-two German tanks were destroyed in a single action on July 6.29 Accordingly, even minor Soviet victories over the German panzer arm assumed disproportionate significance for depleting Germany’s powerful, but very limited, mechanized weapons. While overall matériel losses for the German army at this point in the war remained low, the central importance of the tank and its alarming rate of attrition made its losses particularly critical. With production capacity in Germany still meager, and Hitler’s determination to hold back all new production for future operations, the basis of Germany’s battlefield mobility and striking power was threatened out of all proportion to the numerical strength of its other arms. Summing up the implications of such stark rates of attrition, Generalmajor Walther Nehring, the commander of the 18th Panzer Division, warned: “This situation and its consequences will become unbearable in the future, if we do not want to be destroyed by winning.”30 Panzer losses were not the only fundamental threat to the German Blitzkrieg. Hoth and Guderian were dependent on motorized supply columns for fuel and munitions, and these were having to traverse increasing distances as the advance continued. Some of the trucks were purposebuilt military vehicles, but the vast majority were either requisitioned from the civilian economy or seized from the occupied countries. The heavily loaded civilian vehicles, with lower ground clearance, frequently bottomed out on the rutted and uneven roads, causing severe damage to the transmission and oil sumps. Civilian vehicles also had weaker suspensions that were prone to snap, quickly leaving a trail of wreckage behind the German advance. Alexander Cohrs, assigned to a panzer division, gave a striking description of the perilous roads his unit traversed in the early summer. After referring to the “very bad roads, full of holes,” his diary for July 5 continued: Some [vehicles] tipped over. Luckily none in our company. After eighteen kilometers of marching on foot I sat on an armored vehicle. It tipped so much that it balanced on two wheels, while the other two temporarily stood in the air; still it did not tip over. Along the way was a moor where the vehicles had to make a big detour . . . one by one vehicles got stuck or even turned over, resulting in breaks and a slow tempo.31\n\nDust was another pervasive problem for all motorized transport, as it soon overwhelmed the inadequate air filters and infiltrated the engines. Initially this had the effect of greatly increasing oil consumption (of\n\nKay.indd 27\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:55 PM\n\n28\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\nwhich army stocks were very low); ultimately the engines were immobilized altogether. Movement on roads all across the Soviet Union exacted a toll, as there were very few sealed roads and the conversion of the widegauge Soviet railways was inadequate. Claus Hansmann wrote that his motorized column drove “as if in a sandstorm,” and he observed how “the wheels churned up fountains of sand that blackened out the sun.”32 On July 18, the 18th Panzer Division reported the devastating effect the terrible road conditions were having on the division’s mobility. No less than 1,300 trucks were classed as total losses and a further 1,000 trucks remained under repair.33 Another report from 47th Panzer Corps on August 4 made clear that the dust in the motors of its trucks doomed them to an early grave. Those of the 17th Panzer Division and the 29th Motorized Division were expected to last a further five hundred to eight hundred kilometers “without excessive operational demands,” while the engines of the 18th Panzer Division were forecast to last only another two hundred to four hundred kilometers. The difference between the two estimates rested on the high number of inferior quality French vehicles in the 18th Panzer Division.34 Although such lifespan projections were only made in the war diary of the 47th Panzer Corps, it may be assumed that the other panzer corps were similarly affected, spelling a foreseeable end to the mobility of the panzer groups. As ominous as such developments should have been, the German command was stubbornly fixated on its success. In July, Hoth and Guderian were awarded the prestigious Oak Leaves to the Knight’s Cross, and a number of their subordinate panzer commanders were issued with the Knight’s Cross. Following the encirclement at Minsk, the continued advance broke through the Stalin defensive line built on the Dvina and Dnieper rivers and sought to encircle the remnants of the Soviet armies opposite Army Group Center. This called for a second ring to be closed east of Smolensk, but a month after the start of the war Army Group Center’s offensive strength was waning. The panzer groups fought desperately for the last ten days of July attempting to close the ring, but they were operating in exclusion, having greatly outdistanced the supporting infantry of the Ninth and Second Armies. The result was not only hard fighting to cut off the Smolensk pocket. As more of the previously unknown Soviet reserve armies arrived, the overstretched panzer groups were also holding off large-scale Soviet counteroffensives from the east, at the same time as they were holding the line against breakouts from the pocket to the west. Bock’s panzer groups were greatly overextended, short of munitions, and dispersed over such a wide area that the Soviet counterattacks, although ill coordinated, plunged many of the divisions into crisis.35 The failure to foresee the latent Soviet\n\nKay.indd 28\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:55 PM\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\n29\n\nstrength in the hinterlands now cost the elite German formations dearly. There was no depth to German defensive lines and no reserves to meet local counterattacks or help at crisis points. At Yel’nya on July 26 Guderian’s panzer group noted with alarm: At the fighting around Yel’nya the situation is especially critical. The corps has been attacked all day from strongly superior forces with panzers and artillery. The enemy achieved a breakthrough at Lipnja that has not yet been dealt with. . . . Constant heavy artillery fire is inflicting heavy casualties on the troops. In addition there is the impact of enemy bombers. As a result of the artillery fire, the evacuation of the many wounded has so far not been possible. . . . The corps has absolutely no reserves available. Artillery munitions have been so depleted that no shells remain for bombarding the enemy artillery. For the last few days the panzer brigade of the 10th Panzer Division has been immobilized because oil and fuel supplies are lacking. The corps can maybe manage to hold on to its position, but only at the price of severe bloodletting.36\n\nIt was against this background that the positive perception of the Eastern campaign began to change for the German command, and Bock’s army group was not the only one in difficulty. Army Group North’s progress was stalling as the depth of the advance and the length of its front increased. Army Group South likewise had its hands full facing the largest concentration of Soviet forces in the largest theater of operations. What was foreseen as a straightforward battle of annihilation followed by rapid conquest was turning into a hard-fought, sustained campaign. This was what the OKH had been hoping to avoid. On July 19 Hitler issued War Directive No. 33 calling for the divergent north-south thrusts by Hoth and Guderian’s panzer groups.37 This was Hitler’s solution to the continuing resistance of the Red Army, and one that he felt was consistent with prewar planning. With the battle of Smolensk still in its early stages, Halder hoped that rapid action by Army Group North would mollify Hitler on at least the question of Leningrad and prevent the diversion of Hoth’s forces. Halder also flew to Army Group South on July 20 to see if the speed of operations there could be improved. On July 21 Halder’s outlook remained confident and he told Brauchitsch and the OKH operations chief, Oberst Adolf Heusinger, that the advance on Moscow would suffice with just Hoth’s panzer group and the two infantry armies of Army Group Center.38 Brauchitsch, on the other hand, had become increasingly disheartened by the progress of the war and did not share Halder’s upbeat assessment.39 On July 22 Brauchitsch met with Hitler, and although records of what passed between them are vague, it seems that the commander in chief of the army expressed his doubts over the recent war directive, and he may even\n\nKay.indd 29\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:56 PM\n\nDisclaimer: Some images in the printed version of this book are not available for inclusion in the eBook.

In any case, Hitler was incensed and his response was emphatic. He felt the matter was serious enough to issue a supplement to his previous war directive (known as War Directive No. 33a), which outlined in stern language what had essentially already been ordered in Directive No. 33. More than likely Hitler saw for the first time that the OKH had not been entirely honest with him about its strategic intentions, and if Brauchitsch had divulged anything relating to Halder’s intention to attack Moscow with Hoth’s units, Hitler may have correctly guessed he was being manipulated. Hitler already held a degree of instinctive suspicion toward the desk generals at the OKH, and with their turbulent past dispute over strategic matters seeming to rear its head again, Hitler had acted decisively. When news of Directive No. 33a reached Brauchitsch and Halder there was consternation. The directive made clear that Army Group Center’s two infantry armies were considered strong enough to eliminate all Soviet opposition east of Smolensk and capture Moscow. The panzer groups, it was stated, would be sent to the northern and southern flanks. Halder and Brauchitsch resolved to visit Hitler the following day (July 23) to confront him over the plans and argue for the Moscow alternative. In the event, Halder put the case strongly for attacking Moscow and even suggested that success on this front would lead to German troops on the Volga by the start of October—a belief Halder privately mocked.40 As had been the case since the beginning, the chief of the General Staff was prepared to promise Hitler far more than was possible in order to gain his strategic preference, even if this necessitated outright dishonesty. Hitler’s response to Halder’s presentation was a lecture of his own on the wisdom of Directive No. 33a; there was no middle ground explored and no sense of a compromise. The lines of an open dispute were therefore drawn. Hitler’s mind seemed to be made up, yet Halder was adamant in his resolve, and with the OKH nominally responsible for command on the Eastern Front, Halder was not about to concede on the single most important question of the war’s continuation. The effect, Halder later noted, “was explosive.”41 As the bitterness and recriminations of the infighting within the German command took hold, the lack of understanding for the diminishing offensive power of the Ostheer soon became pervasive. Neither Hitler nor his senior generals had an accurate picture of what was happening to the panzer groups or what would be required for a decisive victory over the Red Army. The source of this ignorance was in part a pervasive self-deception at many levels of the German chain of command that fostered a resilient ideological bias and superiority myth. Even in the face\n\nKay.indd 31\n\n1/3/2012 5:18:57 PM\n\n32\n\nRadicalizing Warfare\n\nof the dismal reports coming up from below, this bias precluded a frank appraisal of the campaign’s development. On the other hand, even among the more pragmatic minded commanders who could see how difficult the campaign was becoming, there was an inherent contradiction in making negative reports. The Nazi ideal of a tough, firebrand commanding officer who acted with iron resolve and forged ahead with the power of an indomitable will was incompatible with the dire, and sometimes panicked, warnings that circumstances necessitated. In this manner the flow of candid information, along with the open expression of opinion, was stunted at many levels of command. At the strategic level the result was ruinous. The plan to win the war in the east had radicalized since the failure to destroy the Red Army in the first phase of the war. The encirclement at Minsk and the second underway at Smolensk were clearly not going to suffice. As a result, the German political and military commands were locked in an embittered dispute, forcefully backing rival alternatives. Yet in the combat units the parallel radicalization was also taking its toll, threatening to undercut both alternative plans. While in the opening days and weeks of the war the German forces operated with a clear tactical superiority, they were increasingly suffering from reduced maneuverability, physical fatigue, matériel losses, and a lack of supplies. In addition, vigorous Soviet counterattacks often had to be held by units operating in isolation over extensive battlefields without adequate flank protection. The result was that Soviet offensives, although often launched with depleted forces and a distinct lack of coordination, were now engaging a German enemy on a far more even playing field. The deadly German formula of concentrated strength and firepower, together with swift battlefield mobility, was much less evident and it was the vital motorized divisions that were being ground down. Clearly a watershed had been reached and the character of the war was changing as a result. At the beginning of the campaign Guderian’s Panzer Group numbered some 953 tanks of all models,42 but five weeks later on July 29 only 286 tanks remained—a 70 percent loss of its original strength. As the Panzer Group’s war diary noted, “this figure is exceedingly low.”43 More worrying still, of the remaining total only 135 tanks consisted of the modern Mark III and Mark IV designs, the other 128 tanks consisted of the obsolete Mark II. In Hoth’s Panzer Group the situation was little better. One of his panzer corps was at 40 percent stren"
