With regard to the history of the robbery and, especially, the restitution of property belonging to European Jews, it is also an intercontinental history, which can benefit enormously from an open exchange of views not only within Europe but also with colleagues in North America. In this way, a broad spectrum of different approaches, perspectives, and interpretations can be brought together, reflecting the often contrasting and conflicting international views on this contentious subject. Thus, the English-language edition of this volume represents an important step in summarizing, analyzing, and interpreting the results of much recent research on the topic of robbery and restitution, taking it beyond the bounds of narrow national historiography and disseminating it more widely to an international audience. For this considerable achievement it is necessary to thank a multitude of sponsors and mentors who made this project possible. First of all, Klaus-Dietmar Henke and the Hannah-Arendt-Institut in Dresden, as well as Ulrich Herbert (Freiburg), must be mentioned for their support of a conference in January 2002, which laid the groundwork for this volume. The conference, which was generously hosted by the Center for Comparative European History in Berlin, was entitled: “‘Aryanisation’ and Restitution in a Comparative Perspective: The Question of Jewish Property Stolen under Nazi Occupation in Europe,” and gathered academics from more than a dozen countries. The conference was also supported generously by the Kurt and Marga Möllgaard Foundation, which also contributed to the publication of the German edition and to part of the translation expenses for this volume. Warm thanks go also to the Volkswagen Foundation, which has supported not only the conference and the German publication, but also made an indispensable contribution by their funding of the Center for Comparative European History over a number of years. In addition to those institutions that participated were also many individuals, without whom the project would not have been realized. Włodzimierz Borodziej, Gerald Feldman, Klaus-Dietmar Henke, Ulrich Herbert, Manfred Hildermeier, and Jürgen Kocka all contributed sound\n\n00-Prelims:Dean\n\n2/12/07\n\nPreface\n\n10:37 AM\n\nPage xi\n\nxi\n\nadvice and constructive criticism to the project from its inception through to its completion. Not to be forgotten also are the individual authors, who have given us not only the product of their research, but have responded tirelessly and promptly in clarifying specific translation queries and checking their manuscripts. In addition, much deserved thanks goes to Charlotte Kreutzmüller and the other translators for their precise rendering of difficult financial terms and concepts. Also present at the conference were numerous scholars, from all over Europe, who made insightful comments on the various papers, some of which have been included in the present publication. For her great efforts in organizing the conference in Berlin, we thank also Heike Emmrich of the Center for Comparative European History. With specific regard to the English-language edition, we thank Paul Shapiro and his staff at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which was the main sponsor for both the costs of translation and the editorial work on this publication. Special thanks must go to Michael Gelb of the Center for his careful review of the entire manuscript. Finally, we are grateful also to Frank Bajohr and Constantin Goschler for contributing their essays from the earlier volume entitled: “,Arisierung’ und Restitution: Die Rückerstattung jüdischen Eigentums in Deutschland und Österreich nach 1945 und 1989,” edited by Constantin Goschler and Jürgen Lillteicher, which filled the gap on Robbery and Restitution in Germany itself, and also to Regula Ludi for contributing an additional piece on Switzerland to round out this Englishlanguage edition most effectively.

Historical perspectives on the Holocaust and its consequences have changed at the same time. From the rising number of recent historical studies now emerges a much more detailed picture of the persecution of the Jews in Germany and in Nazi-dominated territories during the war.1 At the same time these works increasingly raise the issue of the role of the European societies from which the Jews were torn as a result of German policy. The process of expropriating the Jews (and this also includes its “legal” forms) has taken on a central importance, since it took place with much greater participation by, or at least was more clearly visible to, the population than their murder. Stolen Jewish property also linked victims, perpetrators, bystanders, and their heirs again in the postwar years. The conflicts over the restitution of Jewish property—which mainly took place in two phases, after 1945 and after 1990—offer penetrating insights into the values and structure of European societies. This dual and yet indivisible combination of topics, robbery and restitution, is the subject for the essays in this volume, which for the first time brings together authors from eastern and western Europe for a comparative survey, and which in the scope of its subject matter also spans the former division of the continent into East and West. Even if the massive expropriation of the Jews is examined here from a new, European perspective, the starting point of this crime must not be forgotten. From 1933 the Jews in Germany were progressively expropriated, destroying their economic and social lives.2 Contemporaries and historians have often simply described this process by using the shorthand term “Aryanization.” While this concept with its racial connotations in the narrow sense originally meant only the transfer of property from Jewish to Notes for this section begin on page 15.\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n4\n\n2/13/07\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nConstantin Goschler and Philipp Ther\n\nnon-Jewish hands, in the postwar years its meaning has broadened to encompass all material aspects of the persecution of the Jews.3 This lack of clarity unfortunately casts a shadow over the scholarly use of the concept. Nevertheless, there is still no comprehensive and at the same time practical alternative capable of describing the complete process of taking away all the property rights of the Jews. For this reason, care will be taken in this volume in the use of terms to ensure that in each separate case the respective degree of “legality” or the use of direct or indirect force is accurately described. In accordance with the circumstances, therefore, terms such as “Aryanization,” “liquidation,” “seizure,” “spoliation,” and “expropriation,” as well as “looting” and “theft,” will be used. The Nazis extended their attack on Jewish property in a series of steps, initially to Austria following the so-called Anschluss, then to the border regions of Czechoslovakia, and finally to all those regions that directly or indirectly came under German sway during World War II.4 When the Jews of the occupied territories were expropriated, their possessions were either brought back to the German Reich or they fell into the possession of the local states and the non-Jewish population there. Whereas the radicalization of persecution from expropriation to destruction spanned a number of years within the Reich, in the occupied territories this development was compressed into a much shorter time. In many places the looting of Jewish property took place only in the wake of their murder, but was nonetheless closely linked to it. Already during the Second World War, the eighteen signatory states of the London Inter-Allied Declaration of 5 January 1943 announced that all expropriation measures in those territories occupied by the Germans were null and void. They also pronounced that all such transfers of property would be reversed after the war, regardless of whether the case was one of outright theft or a concealed, ostensibly legal transaction. In fact many European countries also implemented measures for the restitution of Jewish property immediately following the liberation, sometimes even before the German capitulation. In contrast to the pattern later in Germany, there was no massive, if ultimately unsuccessful, resistance by the Aryanizers against the restitution of Jewish property. Nonetheless, for a variety of reasons, the extent of restitution still remained limited. Many of the dispossessed Jews had been murdered, while others had succeeded in reaching other countries. If there were no surviving family members, there was the question of who the legitimate heir was. The situation was similar in places where formerly large Jewish communities had been shrunk to only a small fraction of their former size. After the war, the respective home states, the reconstructed local Jewish communities, and international Jewish organizations all competed for heirless Jewish property. In this can be seen a development that became increasingly common as the distance in time from the events of the Holocaust expanded, namely, that the property’s significance for a collective Jewish identity increased relative to the importance of restoring the individual rights of those who had suffered losses. The difficulties concerning heirless\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n2/13/07\n\nIntroduction\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 5\n\n5\n\nJewish property became more acute the greater the percentage of Jews that were murdered. However, even for surviving Jews, getting property back was often difficult. Everywhere in Europe, the principle was established that only citizens of the country in which the property to be restituted was located could make a claim for its return. This excluded from restitution after 1945—and also after 1990—many Jews who had been forced to leave their home countries or who had lost their citizenship. The political division of Europe into East and West since the end of the 1940s has also exerted considerable influence on the process of restitution. Since restitution is based on the principle of private property, the establishment of mixed or socialist economic systems hindered or blocked demands for restitution in countries like Czechoslovakia, where after 1945 initial steps towards the restitution of Jewish property had been taken.5 However, even in Western European countries, there was a mixed result:6 often the surviving Jews encountered great difficulties in recovering their stolen property. This ultimately led to the renewed wave of restitution claims in the 1990s, if during this later phase the actual restitution that had taken place in the immediate postwar years was often overlooked. The situation in Germany demonstrates well the differences between East and West in handling the restitution issue: while in East Germany the Jewish property confiscated between 1933 and 1945 was generally not restituted, in West Germany, during the period of occupation, the Western Allies ordered the restitution of property that could still be found. Furthermore, in 1957 the German Parliament passed the Law for the Fulfilment of the Restitution Obligations of the German Reich, which also covered the property stolen in the occupied territories.7 However, this only applied if the property had been taken to the state territory of the German Federal Republic or Berlin. In addition, restitution claims were only recognized for those Jewish victims of National-Socialist persecution who after 1945 were living in the Federal Republic or elsewhere in the Western world. In this way the logic of the Cold War had a decisive influence on the course of restitution policy. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the question of stolen Jewish property has gained a new actuality throughout Europe. In the wake of the renewed transformation of the structure of property relations in the states of the former Eastern Bloc, the principles established in West Germany for the restitution of Jewish property were initially extended to the newly incorporated eastern states of the German Federal Republic.8 In Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries of the former Eastern Bloc, however, the situation in both legal, moral, and economic terms is much more complicated. Here one has to deal with the consequences of a whole “chain of property revolutions.”9 In some places these started even before the German occupation. In those regions annexed by the Soviet Union after the MolotovRibbentrop Pact, quite considerable property transfers took place, which were only interrupted by the German invasion in June 1941.10 Following the extensive reordering of property relations during the German occupation, which affected not only Jews, between 1945 and 1948 a considerable\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n6\n\n2/13/07\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nConstantin Goschler and Philipp Ther\n\nportion of the local economies in East-Central Europe was nationalized, and in addition the property of former wartime enemies and occupiers was seized by the state. Then in the course of the Sovietization of this region, the whole principle of private property was also called into question. In the era of state socialism that followed, in contrast to the experience in the West, these societies had only limited possibilities to discuss in public their relationship to the Jews and the fate of Jewish property in the past. For these reasons, the restitution of Jewish property is closely linked to the more general program of reprivatization and the privatization of state property, structural economic reform, and even the treatment of religious communities and other issues that are central to creating a new economic and social order. The return of Jewish property in East-Central Europe encounters greater resistance of a different nature than that in Western Europe, as it is seen as a Pandora’s box that, once opened, might result in other massive property changes—for example, changes concerning the property of German refugees and those forcibly resettled at the end of the war.11 Restitution is closely tied to the national and historic identities of these countries, as the question of Jewish property touches also on their own role during the Second World War and the extent of external influence in the establishment of the socialist system. In a broader sense, however, this applies also to the Western European countries, insofar as the issue of restitution raises questions everywhere concerning a country’s role during the war and has an impact on a nation’s self-image.12 Alongside the World Jewish Restitution Organization, a collective body founded in 1992 to represent the interests of various Jewish organizations (in which, however, the representatives of those Jews who remained in Eastern Europe play only a marginal role) the European Union (EU) and other international actors have exerted considerable direct and indirect pressure on the East-Central European states that are applying to join it, urging them to restitute remaining stolen Jewish property still in their countries. The principles of private property and the free movement of capital play key roles in the convergence of legal systems, which has been an important prerequisite for the acceptance of new states into the EU. While privatization in favor of their own citizens has made great progress among the new EU states and remaining applicants, questions concerning the property of emigrants who had lost their citizenship remain unresolved. Apart from the Jewish victims of the Nazis, this also affects other groups, such as the German, Austrian, and Hungarian refugees and victims of forced resettlement, as well as the political refugees of the postwar period. For this reason, the specificity of the Jewish case has to be most carefully stressed in order to prevent it from being exploited for political purposes. The West European countries, whose political systems and social values appeared to have been clearly confirmed by the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, have also been pulled along behind the former Communist states. Courts in the United States and also governmental and nongovernmental organizations in the United States have increasingly put pressure on Euro-\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n2/13/07\n\nIntroduction\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 7\n\n7\n\npean businesses and governments on account of their participation in, or their role as beneficiaries from, the expropriation of Jewish property during the Second World War. At the start of the new campaign for the restitution of Jewish property, the first targets in 1996 were the Swiss banks.13 The public debate centered above all on the fate of bank accounts, insurance policies, and artwork belonging to victims of the Holocaust. The American legal instrument of the class-action lawsuit, which was previously unheard of in Europe, became a very powerful weapon, because so many European companies who wanted to continue doing business in the United States saw themselves threatened with massive financial risks. Therefore, the resurgence of the restitution debate can be seen as an indirect consequence of economic globalization, and also as both reflecting and intensifying the ever-expanding cultural recognition for the victims of historical crimes. In response to the new restitution campaign, which reached its zenith in the 1998 Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets in Washington, DC, more than twenty-three countries established historical commissions. Among them were not only countries occupied by Germany during the war, but also former neutral states and even wartime enemies of the Nazis. The commissions investigated what happened to Jewish property during the war and thereafter. Already in 1944 the total value of Jewish property losses was estimated to have exceeded U.S. $8 billion (using 1944 currency values).14 More recent investigations estimate that the property of the approximately 4.95 million Jews who lived in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, France, Poland, and Hungary before the war, according to exchange rates at the time, was worth about U.S. $12.9 billion. Of that, minus the flight capital that was saved, some $10 billion was lost.15 Such value estimates, however, can only approach the true figure on account of the incomplete nature of the data and, above all, due to the dramatic changes in the overall economic and political framework between 1933 and today. This criticism is not meant to belittle the enormous financial dimensions of the expropriation of Jewish property. In reality, much more was destroyed than was robbed, as many of these values were inseparable from the physical existence of the Jewish property owners or Jewish communities. In addition, it must be borne in mind that property often has a symbolic value also alongside its material worth. The nonmaterial value of photograph albums and similar personal items explains why the last possessions of Holocaust victims have almost achieved the status of religious relics in some historical exhibitions. From the perspective of the non-Jews there had always been wild “fantasies of Jewish wealth,”16 that in the postwar era above all were still shamefully exploited by the Communists for their own ends. But a subsequent generation is also not willing to forget that wealth. So it is not a surprise that recently the memory of stolen Jewish property has been used as the occasion to view the Holocaust as the inherited sin of Europe, which should serve as the negative reference point for the construction of a new European identity.17\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n8\n\n2/13/07\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nConstantin Goschler and Philipp Ther\n\nIn view of the multiple historical layers to the issue of stolen Jewish property, there emerges the question whether the concept of property itself should not be more carefully defined and examined in the light of the changing historical context. Precisely with respect to a Europe-wide comparison, this step appears to be a historiographical necessity. According to Hannes Siegrist and David Sugarman, “property is a ‘package of rights and entitlements,’ which regulates the relationship between people, institutions and goods.”18 As a historical category, therefore, property remains dependent on specific social and economic structures, and the time-related normative understanding of this concept is linked to the respective language and culture. This oscillates between the anarcho-socialist slogan “property is theft” (Pierre Joseph Proudhon), which historically can be found in its national-socialist version in which “Jewish property is theft,” and the liberal formulation that “Socialism is theft” (Gerald D. Feldman). Not only in the People’s Democracies was the sanctity of private property contested, but also in Western Europe after 1945. On the other hand the current interest in the question of restitution is probably linked to the success of a liberal economic world order after 1990, that has made private property into its own iconic symbol. Addressing the treatment of stolen Jewish property after 1945, therefore, demands that one also consider the historical transmutation of values, both in material and conceptual terms. Robbery and restitution are inextricably intertwined, but nevertheless they each need to be examined in a separate analytical framework. With regard to Aryanization, German direction and also active participation frequently stands in the foreground. In the context of a Europe-wide comparison, therefore, it is necessary to examine the relationship between the German Reich and the territories it ruled or occupied. Here the great differences in the treatment of the allied states, and above all between the occupation policies in the West or North by comparison with those in the East, are most striking, as the persecution and destruction of the Jews took on completely different forms in these respective regions. During the war the status of countries falling within the German sphere of control varied from that of Poland, where almost no local participation in the occupation regime was permitted, to that of Vichy France, Slovakia, or Romania, which all retained control over most of their own internal affairs. In addition, some countries changed status during the course of the war from allies of Germany to occupied territories, as was the case with Hungary and Italy. The degree of independence or participation is decisive, therefore, in assessing the role played by the local society, administration, or government in the persecution and expropriation of the Jews. With regard to the process of Aryanization in Europe, three linked perspectives can be differentiated. A first aspect is the expropriation of the Jews as a political process. In this case it is a question of political responsibility, which is closely tied to the respective freedom of action of the local administrations in the various territories dominated by the Germans. Admittedly, in most instances the process consisted primarily of applying an\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n2/13/07\n\nIntroduction\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 9\n\n9\n\nalready-tested model for the robbery of Jewish property borrowed from the German Reich. However, occasionally, as in the case of Austria,19 there were also some reverse transfers and radicalizing effects “from the periphery to the center.” Aryanization in the occupied territories should be understood as an “overdetermined process”20 in which different contributory factors could lead to the same result, making the identification and weighting of the precise causes even more complicated. This can also be applied to the old dispute between the relative importance of ideology and economics: were the Jews robbed mainly on the grounds of antisemitism or rather for utilitarian motives, in order to meet the escalating demands of the Nazi war economy? The dispute, which was conducted so bitterly just a few years ago—at that time focused, however, more on the role of labor rather than of capital—has recently been reopened. Several years ago Götz Aly together with Susanne Heim had proposed the provocative thesis that Aryanization could be viewed as part of a “Flurbereinigung” (reallocation of agricultural land within a community) in Eastern Europe.21 Most recently he has made another argument that shares, however, the emphasis on an economic rationale for Aryanization. Since in Aly’s view the German assault on European Jewry constituted robbery with murder, for him the spoliation of Jewish property no loger appears as a soto-speak ephemeral aspect of the Holocaust, but rather as part of its essential driving force. According to Aly, the property of European Jewry was used to stabilize the local currencies in countries occupied by the Wehrmacht that came under pressure due to the extortionate German occupation costs. These exploitative payments also served the purpose of shifting the financial burden of the war away from German taxpayers and onto the occupied and allied territories.22 Aryanization in Europe, therefore, can be placed within the familiar interpretation that the Nazis did everything possible to avoid a repeat of the collapse of the “home front,” that occurred during the First World War. By ensuring a secure food supply at the expense of the occupied territories, the Nazis assured themselves of the continued support of the German population. While it must been conceded that Aly has offered a fresh synthesis of the German policy of spoliation of Jewish property in Europe during the Second World War, he has been rightfully criticized for driving his point too hard. Even worse, he has also been severely criticized for neglecting wellestablished historical knowledge both on Nazi occupation policies and on domestic social policy for the sake of his argument, which largely reduces the explanation for the spoliation of Jewish property to a prerequisite for what he describes as a Nazi “dictatorship of favors” (Gefälligkeitsdiktatur): thus, Jewish and other stolen property became key instruments for relieving the Volksgemeinschaft [German People’s Community] to a large degree from the financial burdens of war.23 Thereby Aly is not only overestimating the financial benefits for German society to be gained from the robbery of Jewish property but also underestimating more complex explanations for\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n10\n\n2/13/07\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nConstantin Goschler and Philipp Ther\n\nthis process, which try to integrate a multitude of individual and structural factors—not least antisemitism, which is barely mentioned in his account.24 Aly’s argument is very much focused on bureaucratic and political elites—mainly the financial administration of the German Reich. However, his question regarding the role of stolen Jewish assets—and also other stolen property—in the integration and stabilization of the Volksgemeinschaft is also closely linked to a second aspect of our topic, that of Aryanization as a social process. In this respect the wide variety of participants and the dynamic self-radicalization of party and state institutions at the local level, in contrast to the policy of the Reich, has to be examined. How far can this interpretation, which Frank Bajohr presented very convincingly using a case study from the German Reich,25 be transferred to the European level? Naturally the societies in those countries ruled by the Germans during the war had a considerably lower possibility of influencing events than the German population. In some countries, such as in the apparently sovereign state of Croatia or in the German-occupied Banat, however, the local ethnic German population played a central role in the Aryanization of Jewish property and thereby muddied such a clear differentiation between German and local participants.26 Whereas in the occupied countries of Western and Northern Europe, as well as in Bohemia, the Nazis made an effort at least to secure a certain degree of loyalty from the local population, such concerns were almost completely absent in Poland, Serbia, and the occupied parts of the Soviet Union. Although the German Reich was involved in one way or another in almost all Aryanizations and frequently controlled them completely, nonetheless the collaboration of local institutions and offices also played a considerable role. Their relevance for the different expropriation processes depended both on the respective status of the countries and also the timing of events. The local institutions and offices, however, could not operate in complete isolation from their respective societies and the prevailing attitudes in them. The expropriation of the Jews, therefore, was not limited simply to the implementation of German orders, but was also linked to the behavior of local societies towards the Jews, that is, to the different forms of antisemitism. As in the German Reich, the corruptive influence that spread with enrichment from Jewish property in the occupied territories could also lead to various forms of accommodation to the policies of Nazi Germany.27 The robbery of Jewish property is therefore also a useful barometer for the relations of various local populations toward Nazi Germany, to the German occupational authorities, and also toward the Jewish population of their own countries. Aryanizations in the German Reich and in the occupied Western countries—with regard both to their quality and their quantity—constituted a unique historical event. It is not so clear whether the same can be said with regard to those countries, such as Poland, where the expropriations under German occupation also widely affected the non-Jewish population. Such a comparison could help to resolve the conflict between two competing interpretations. In one explanatory model, which Jan Gross applied to Poland,\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n2/13/07\n\nIntroduction\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 11\n\n11\n\nindigenous antisemitism is accorded a very important role in this connection.28 According to another explanatory model, the conduct of Polish society is seen as a more complex phenomenon. The proven participation of the local population in robbing their Jewish neighbors is seen as a product of an increasing radicalization and loss of restraint resulting from the breakdown of social ties along ethnic lines that can be found repeatedly in reports from the occupation period.29 Both the role of the local population as witnesses to the Holocaust and also the impact of radical German economic exploitation in the occupied territories, which led to bitter social conflicts over scarce resources, contributed to this development. In general, when trying to explain and thereby also make a moral assessment of the looting and other property crimes, the fact cannot be ignored that during a period when all laws were being broken and people were being deliberately murdered, property laws must have been viewed with much less respect than today. This brings us to a third aspect, namely the possibility of establishing a typology for Aryanization and its consequences in Europe. In contrast to the murder of the Jews, where there are considerable differences in the proportion of Jews killed from one country to another, with respect to the robbery national differences existed more with regard to the process than the end result: Jewish property everywhere was stolen as comprehensively as possible. Those delays that occurred resulted mainly from the self-interest of the participating bureaucrats, who sought to keep themselves occupied in comfortable jobs well away from the dangers of the front.30 The respective form of German rule—direct or indirect—was only a secondary consideration with regard to the form of Aryanization applied. The decisive factor emerging from the comparison was undoubtedly the different methods applied for implementing the murder of the Jews in various regions,31 which itself in part reflected the respective harshness of German rule.32 In areas such as Poland and the occupied parts of the Soviet Union, where the Jews were murdered inside the country or even locally, close to their homes, the robbery was more directly linked to the murder than in places where the deportation of the Jews put considerable distance between these events. Furthermore the different forms of robbery also reflected the pace of destruction, as generally Jewish property was used initially to support the Jews prior to their murder.33 Therefore, a comparative analysis of the robbery measures reveals a clear difference between Western and Eastern Europe, as in the West (and the North) greater care was taken to preserve at least the appearance of measures based on a legal framework. The West and the East, of course, were defined quite differently during the Second World War than they were after 1945—namely in accordance with the Nazis’ own racial criteria, which again confirms the conditional nature of these apparently objective geographic categories. Both the Czech lands and Hungary, while under German occupation, still belonged to some extent to the West, whereas soon after the end of the war they became part of the East.\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n12\n\n2/13/07\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nConstantin Goschler and Philipp Ther\n\nDifferences existed also with respect to the impact of the robbery of Jewish property on the economic and social structures of the various countries. In Western and Northern Europe, but also in Southeastern Europe and the Czech lands—in contrast to Poland and the western part of the Soviet Union—the Jews comprised a relatively small proportion of the total population and therefore their despoliation had a much smaller impact on the overall national economies of these regions. But other consequences of the war were also different: in Western and Northern Europe the old borders remained intact, whereas the war in Central and Eastern Europe resulted in large-scale border changes that continued after 1945. The extent of war destruction also presents a differentiated picture, as the destruction of the economic and social structure in the East was generally much more radical. These key contrasts also contributed significantly to subsequent differences in how the restitution of Jewish property was handled. The analytical framework for a comparison of restitution in Europe is shaped by the fact that German responsibility for the theft is of quite a different quality than that of other European countries, and by the fact that only in West Germany was restitution initiated as an integral part of Allied occupation policy. These reasons alone produced certain key contrasts to both the course and nature of restitution in Germany compared with other European countries.34 Despite these differences, the current rapidly expanding research on how to deal with historical crimes often draws upon “German compensation payments” as a possible model,35 if at the same time the issue of restitution has so far attracted less attention. Restitution faces a dilemma: restitutions, compensation and reparations all aim by definition at righting historical wrongs, which, in the case of Nazi crimes, however, can at best only be alleviated.36 Therefore, the question of what the restitution of Jewish property means in the context of justice for historical crimes produces some quite divergent responses. Research so far has produced five, partly overlapping, explanatory approaches. One approach stresses above all the role of external political pressure, in which the United States is seen as the decisive actor. This argument, which previously was developed mainly in reference to the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG),37 has found renewed application in the course of the recent wave of restitution demands directed at various European states. The political and economic power of the United States was seen as playing a central role during the first phase of restitution in Germany and Austria after the war, and the same can be said with respect to the other European countries in the period after 1990. Yet the examination above all of Western European states, such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, after 1944, reveals that political pressure from the United States at this time was not sufficient on its own to explain the efforts for restitution.38 Rather, the restitution of stolen Jewish property resulted here initially from the great concern with restoring those legal rights that had been violated by the German occupation authorities. This raises the question of the link between restitution and the structure of civil property rights. According to Ulrich Herbert the restitution of\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n2/13/07\n\nIntroduction\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 13\n\n13\n\nJewish property provides the basis for the reestablishment of trust, which is a vital resource for the functioning of an economic system based on private property.39 This is linked to the apparent paradox of liberal economic theory known as the “Adam Smith problem,” in which the fairness and the realism of the market are inextricably linked. Adam Smith argued that a market economy functioning largely without regulation could only be successful if the participants had faith in the justice of society and the fairness of the other traders in the market.40 Without doubt, a liberal economic order based on private property has always been a necessary prerequisite for the restitution of Jewish property. Of course, this would in all cases neither have prevented the theft, nor was it subsequently a sufficient condition on its own to ensure that restitution took place. Restitution was most likely in countries such as France, where a relatively large proportion of the victims survived to make their own claims after the war. The problem with arguments based on the central significance of the resource “trust” for the functioning of a liberal economic order becomes clear when it is noted that those who had acquired Jewish property under the circumstances of a general persecution of the Jews later insisted that they had acted in “good faith.” However, the reintroduction of a liberal economic system based on private property in the countries of the former Eastern Bloc after 1990 demonstrates that even though a clear connection can be seen, it is not guaranteed that this change will necessarily lead to the restoration of Jewish property. A third argument also sees a link between restitution and the existence of a civil society as an important prerequisite for the constructive solution of property issues.41 This draws upon the recent appreciation of the role of “civil society” as an instrument for overcoming dictatorship, that is, coping with the consequences of dictatorship in the postcommunist countries of the former Eastern Bloc. In fact, only in those places where a civil society existed did restitution take place. On the other hand, where groups organized themselves in connection with the conflict over stolen Jewish property, it was mostly directed at blocking or at least restricting the scope of restitution. The restitution of Jewish property therefore provides an important case study for examining the question of how well civil societies are able to handle the historical exclusion and discrimination of minorities. The strong historical link between the nation-state and civil society that in many ways made its emergence possible can also be a factor that contributes to some limitations of civility. The conflicts after 1945 and 1990 over stolen Jewish property thereby point to a certain ambivalence that is built into the concept of civil society.42 These interpretations of the restitution of Jewish property, which appeal to the principles of civil society, also run into some other more fundamental limitations: even the most successful restitution would not be able to bring back to life those who were murdered. At this point, interpretations based on compensation for individuals run up against other models based on group rights.43 Elazar Barkan, who views restitution not as a legal\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n14\n\n2/13/07\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nConstantin Goschler and Philipp Ther\n\ncategory but rather as a cultural concept, focuses on the question, whether the notably increased importance attached to the recognition of historical guilt during the last century also reflects the development of new international moral standards.44 For him restitution is primarily “negotiated history” in which different groups that are linked by an “historical crime” seek to overcome the conflict in their search for a common narrative, thereby also changing their own identity. Denying the assumption of universal standards of justice, in this way Barkan views justice as the outcome of a negotiation between different communities, with reference to somewhat vague international standards of justice. However, it should be noted that the restitution of Jewish property in Europe generally has not entailed a new negotiation of social identity connected with the inclusion of a previously disadvantaged minority, as was the case with most postcolonial conflicts. In addition, with respect to such an “intercommunicative history” one also has to examine closely who is conducting the negotiations with whom and on whose behalf, and especially to assess how far the individual victims themselves are involved at all in the creation of such a narrative.45 The question of the connection between property and memory also arises here, which leads to a fifth point. In the historical and anthropologically-oriented explanation of Dan Diner, restitution not only leads to a reawakening of the memory vested in property; rather, restitution itself is the result of a rediscovered memory.46 Here Diner is refering above all to the latest wave of restitution claims, which should be seen against the background of a vast increase in the public and private memory of the Holocaust over recent years. That restoring property to its previous owners reawakens associated memories is more or less to be expected. It is much harder, however, to prove the reverse proposition that historical memory has directly contributed to the restitution process. In this respect, one has to differentiate between separate phases and regions. In any case it becomes clear that the element of memory made a greater contribution to the process of restitution the longer the time since the events being remembered and also the less this memory had to compete with other painful memories arising from the consequences of the Second World War. This process was not the same throughout Europe. Rather the memory of stolen Jewish property is part of a complex European history of property losses, since the forced expulsion of ethnic minorities and the property transfers linked thereto were central elements in the creation of ethnically homogeneous nation-states in Europe. The integration of these events within an overall historical framework remains a long-term project for the history of the twentieth century, in which historians from both sides of the former Iron Curtain can also learn a great deal from one another. However, one further problem remains unsolved for the moment: at least for the period after 1945, the perspective of the Jewish victims, over which the bitter conflicts regarding lost property have cast a dark shadow, cannot simply be integrated within a broader European history of how postwar societies dealt with the legacies of the Nazi past. Rather, this must\n\n01-Intro:Dean\n\n2/13/07\n\n1:51 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nbe contrasted with the story of the reconstruction of Jewish life after the war that took place largely outside of Europe. The attempt to integrate the German or the European perspective on the one hand, and the Jewish or intercontinental perspective on the other hand, in researching the issue of how stolen Jewish property was handled, reinforces the need to dissolve social history from its long-term connection to the unit of the nation-state and to pay much more attention to transnational processes. Otherwise the transnational and even transcontintental history of European societies in the twentieth century, itself in large part unleashed by Nazi Germany, cannot be successfully addressed.

This chapter addresses the comparative study of Aryanization, confiscation, and plunder, using the results of current research as a starting point. This overview identifies the main issues confronting historians and also the problems they entail. One important aspect is the close relationship between property seizure and the development of the Holocaust. The considerable differences in the methods of plunder used by the Nazis and their collaborators in Eastern Europe in comparison with Western Europe arose primarily from the manner in which the Holocaust was implemented and the nature of the respective occupation regimes. However, the differences that existed in the structure of property ownership in various Jewish populations may in some respects have influenced the approach taken towards its confiscation and seizure.2 The precise chronology of the Holocaust also played a decisive role. In Western Europe the aim was to secure Jewish wealth prior to the deportations, especially in the form of businesses, bank accounts, and securities.3 Naturally this involved intentional deception to secure as much of the booty as possible. On occupied Soviet territory much of the property collection was done directly at the killing sites; in Latvia, the registration of Jewish property was even conducted retrospectively, in the wake of the grisly massacres, in a largely vain attempt to claw back items from the local population.4 This volume deals primarily with the seizure of Jewish property in the occupied territories. However, in order to examine and compare events in both Eastern and Western Europe, it is necessary also to understand the Notes for this section begin on page 29.\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n22\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 22\n\nMartin Dean\n\nexperiences gained and the wide variety of mechanisms first developed inside the Reich in Germany and Austria.5 For the Nazi leadership these served as a ready-made model that they planned to extend to all areas under their control. Unfortunately the complex structure of competing measures in the Reich does not serve well as a Weberian “ideal type” for the comparative study of Aryanization. There was an important learning process in the application of property seizure measures throughout Europe, which applies to laws, institutions, and even to the transfer of key personnel.6 For example, certain extensive plans only partially implemented in the Reich were subsequently perfected in the Netherlands.7 Thus it is necessary for historians to confront not only “unequal comparisons,” but also a centrally coordinated system of “mechanism transfers” that varied in intensity over time and space.8 Most accounts of Jewish economic persecution begin with the laws passed from 1933 onwards that excluded Jews from the civil service and other professions, and the boycotts applied against Jewish businesses.9 These two examples demonstrate the combination of legal measures and direct Nazi Party pressure that was applied to drive the Jews out of the German economy. With regard to property rights, however, the bundle of laws decreed in July 1933, authorizing the confiscation of property of “enemies of the people and the state” and also the denaturalization of emigrants, opened the door to the subsequent massive confiscation of Jewish property.10 Following a Himmler decree in the spring of 1937 that broadened the categories of persons targeted, increasing numbers of Jews were subjected to denaturalization.11 This included the seizure of their property as an important aim of the exercise. By this time, the Reich Capital Flight Tax and strict currency restrictions were also extracting a severe financial toll from Jewish emigrants. According to an internal Finance Ministry memorandum from 1935, Jews attempting to transfer remaining funds by legal means suffered a loss of almost 80 percent.12 The close network of observation and restrictions applied by the police, the currency offices, and the administration developed into the full-scale blocking of Jewish bank accounts by the currency offices in the late summer of 1939.13 With regard to the Nazi policy of removing the Jews from the economy—the “Economic Final Solution”—a clear legal framework was required for it to be effective. Potential buyers and middlemen were reluctant to invest in Jewish property without obtaining Rechtssicherheit, secure legal title to businesses or real estate. Thus in every country there was the need for an extensive legal and administrative framework to legitimize the theft. This problem was even more critical in occupied and satellite countries during the war, as exile regimes, such as those from the Netherlands and Norway, passed laws outlawing cooperation in German measures of confiscation.14 Interestingly it was the wave of spontaneous or “wild Aryanizations” in Austria immediately following the Anschluss in 1938 that gave increased impetus to Nazi legal and institutional measures. Both the registration of Jewish property and the ensuing decrees organizing the compulsory\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 23\n\nThe Seizure of Jewish Property in Europe\n\n23\n\nAryanization of businesses represented attempts by Göring to reassert state control.15 The private Aryanization of many Jewish businesses had occurred prior to 1938, permitting some spectacular private profits. During the course of 1938 a network of laws, supervisory institutions, and regulations were put in place that ensured that henceforth the German state would pocket the difference between the lower price paid into blocked Jewish accounts and the actual market price. Many of the institutions and mechanisms used to complete Aryanization in the Reich, such as the Deutsche Revisions- und Treuhand AG, were also adopted and adapted for use in the occupied territories, such as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia or the Netherlands.16 Another major innovation in 1938 in terms of economic exploitation was the introduction of the Punitive Tax (Judenvermögensabgabe) in the wake of the Kristallnacht [Reich Crystal Night] pogrom. By 1940 this one measure had raised in excess of RM 1.1 billion for Germany’s hard-pressed war finances, representing roughly 25 percent of Jewish taxable wealth at this time.17 This was only the first and most spectacular of many special taxes or “contributions” imposed on Jewish communities of all sizes throughout occupied Europe from Minsk to Rome.18 It clearly provided the model for the similar “Punitive Fine” of 1 billion francs imposed on the occupied northern zone of France.19 The comparative success of the Punitive Tax and other measures in securing Jewish assets through the regular tax administration calls into question interpretations focused on the Security Police as the main agent of financial exploitation. In practice, financial exploitation relied on the close cooperation between the executive authority of the Security Police and the technical expertise of the financial administration to achieve this complex task. Considerable rivalry and friction still remained, however, between the two branches. This was especially intense in the occupied eastern territories, where new institutions competed openly for jurisdiction without concern for existing structures and norms in the absence of a civil society.20 One clear reason for the institutional conflicts that were inherent to the seizure of Jewish property came from differences over aims. Prior to the war the aim of the Sicherheitspolizei [Security Police] (Sipo) and the Sicherheitsdienst [Security Service] (SD) was to encourage Jewish emigration by any means possible. In this respect the extraordinary taxes and strict currency restrictions applied mainly to raise revenue actually proved counterproductive by making it impossible for many Jews to leave. Thus the creation of the Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung [Central Office for Jewish Emigration] in Vienna, and also subsequently the Reichszentrale für jüdische Auswanderung [Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration] in 1939, were attempts to square the circle by mobilizing the assets of wealthy Jews and even international welfare organizations directly in support of forced emigration. The Security Police used similar methods to extort large sums from the deportees during the war.21 Nevertheless, the detailed work of winding up Jewish estates was still left to the financial bureaucracy under the\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n24\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 24\n\nMartin Dean\n\ncomprehensive provisions of the Eleventh Decree to the Reich Citizenship Law, published on 26 November 1941.22 Similar conflicts over control of resources and policy were also played out in the occupied countries. For example, in the Netherlands Generalkommissar Hans Fischböck’s model of technocratic plunder by decree triumphed over plans to expand the competence of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration set up by the Sipo/SD. This was indeed ironic, as the Central Office in the Netherlands was originally envisioned as a model institution for the whole of Europe.23 These questions of the respective role of administrative and police authorities and also the extent to which new institutions were created are important issues for comparative study. They are of particular relevance to collaborating regimes. An examination of these structural components would also be revealing for other key issues ranging from levels of corruption to the responses of officials. Jean-Marc Dreyfus argues, for example, that the French deliberately applied more bureaucratic resources to Aryanization than was the case in the Netherlands or Belgium, in an effort to increase oversight and reduce corruption, responding to previous scandals involving the nationalization of church property earlier in the century.24 Emerging from the clashes within the Nazi bureaucracy, one principle that remained important for the Sipo was the need for anti-Jewish measures to pay for themselves. Above all officials were anxious that the increasingly impoverished Jewish community should not become a burden on the state. Thus even deportees faced an extra tax to cover their travel costs.25 Camps established for Jewish inmates in Serbia and the Netherlands were financed with the proceeds from Jewish property.26 This principle was even enshrined within the Eleventh Decree itself, which stated that the funds raised were to be used “to serve the furtherance of all purposes connected with the solution of the Jewish Question.”27 Within this framework some funds were used, at least temporarily, to support existing Jewish welfare structures. It is interesting that similar patterns can be detected in the occupied territories, especially in the West, in countries such as the Netherlands and France, if only a tiny fraction of seized property was used in this way.28 These key questions of who should control the process of property seizure and what happened to the proceeds took on special importance for regimes collaborating with the Germans. For the occupied territories, the Reich authorities decided that in most cases the proceeds from Jewish property should be applied to the budgets of the respective German-dominated administrations. This meant that the proceeds from Jewish valuables seized in Latvia and sold in Berlin were to be transferred back to the accounts of Reichskommissariat Ostland.29 However, the actual cash flows require careful study. Often the net effect was much the same. For example, in Serbia payments made into the Serbian State Bank from the proceeds of Jewish property were earmarked to pay off German war compensation claims before they had even been received.30 In Western Europe the Germans also extracted vast sums from local budgets to pay for so-called occupation\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 25\n\nThe Seizure of Jewish Property in Europe\n\n25\n\ncosts.31 Nevertheless this pattern helps to explain how in countries such as Belgium and Norway, for instance, so much of Jewish wealth remained in state hands within the country after the war.32 A striking element of the property seizures was the comprehensive nature of the process. In most areas under direct German administration, the aim was to gain control of all the property from all the Jews, with only a few exceptions made for half-Jews or foreign nationals. Only in some satellite countries, such as Vichy France or Bulgaria, were the measures less complete in their aims.33 In Bulgaria, for example, a certain number of Jewish merchants were permitted to remain in business.34 A major problem in all areas remained, nevertheless, the question of correctly identifying Jewish property. This led to the widespread registration of Jewish property and its seizure in close conjunction with deportation and destruction measures, for example, by the clearing of vacated apartments. In this way the seizure of property itself became part of the destruction process. The exhaustive process of administering and selling off Jewish property usually involved a considerable administrative effort, employing hundreds of local staff.35 In fact it was rarely completed before the end of the war. Even in the Netherlands, generally seen as one of the most efficient cases, some one thousand Jewish businesses had neither been sold nor liquidated by 1945.36 In most other countries, including Germany, a large proportion of files still remained open at the end of the war. For some officials there was little incentive to finish what was a very desirable job away from the front.37 Often the high administration costs consumed much of the actual income generated from the property, and a number of organizations and individuals took their cut.38 These ranged from semiofficial entities such as the Vugesta in Vienna to legions of property assessors, auction houses, trustees, estate agents, notaries, and transport companies.39 Often the profits were concealed within generous expenses and high salaries. It is not possible to enumerate all the various kinds of property seized. Only a brief survey of the main categories will be given here, as different types of property required different means of seizure and confiscation that in turn led to clear similarities across regions.40 Direct quantitative comparisons remain, however, problematic due to the inevitable difficulties in calculating currency conversions (for a controlled economy) and assessing the accuracy of reported economic values, for example, from property registration forms. Personal property, such as cash, jewelry, and clothing, was frequently secured directly by the police in connection with arrests, deportations, and mass shootings. In other cases valuables had to be surrendered on demand. Furniture and other personal items were also secured in port storage facilities and empty houses and apartments. These items were sold or auctioned off locally, or used to benefit specific groups, such as bomb-damage victims or ethnic Germans. Valuables were frequently sent to Berlin to be sold for foreign exchange or otherwise applied to the war economy. Many Jewish businesses were Aryanized prior to the deportations, involving a wide range of private and state actors as trustees, evaluators, and\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n26\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 26\n\nMartin Dean\n\napproval authorities. Real estate and mortgages, if not sold by the owner, generally took time to liquidate, as land registers had to be amended and restrictions were drawn up on those persons entitled to buy them. Financial instruments—mainly bank accounts, securities, and safe deposit boxes— were wound up in close cooperation with the banks, where most were deposited. These were often the most liquid assets, taken up first to pay punitive fines and cover the Jews’ emigration or living expenses. Similarly, life insurance policies and pensions were generally regulated through the financial administration, with the capitalized values being transferred directly to the state. The existence of outstanding debts and loans was one of the main reasons for the enormous bureaucratic effort involved in maintaining separate files for each victim, as the state still had to regulate outstanding credits and debts. Even intellectual property, such as the proceeds from patents and copyright royalties, were seized.41 The special value of cultural property, including artworks, books, and archives, called into existence a number of extraordinary German collecting agencies that operated throughout Europe. For example, the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg [Rosenberg Operational Staff] (ERR) followed the German Army into newly occupied territories to secure some of the most valuable items for the Party’s own ideological institutions. Among the competitors for cultural property were the Foreign Office, the Wehrmacht, the Dienststelle Mühlmann subordinate to Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart in the Netherlands, Himmler’s Ahnenerbe, and also various sections of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt [Reich Security Main Office] (RSHA).42 As several of these agencies, but especially the ERR, acted in a number of countries, they might provide a useful perspective for specific comparative studies. Jewish communal property was largely handled by the Gestapo, either through direct seizures or the management of communal organizations (such as the Reichsvereinigung) under Gestapo control. For instance, Eichmann organized the liquidation of assets belonging to the Jewish communities in Austria that was largely completed by 1941.43 What role did Jewish property play in the development of the Holocaust? Even before the Nazis came to power they used envy and exaggerated claims about the influence of Jewish wealth to stir up antisemitic feelings. In particular, the Nazis viewed Jewish wealth as ill-gotten gains that had to be brought back into the possession of the German people. Jewish property was used to reward Party “Old Fighters” who sought compensation for alleged economic losses in the past.44 The radicalization of measures taken against the Jewish population from 1938 onwards was closely linked to a full-scale assault on their property rights. Economic discrimination and plunder contributed directly to the Nazi process of destruction in a variety of ways. Everdiminishing means reduced the opportunities for Jews to emigrate and flee, and ultimately wore down their physical ability to resist. At the direct level of implementation, the prospect of booty helped to motivate local collaborators in the pogroms and massacres orchestrated by\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 27\n\nThe Seizure of Jewish Property in Europe\n\n27\n\nGerman security forces in the East.45 In some cases the names of the victims are even included in property lists sent back to the Reichshauptkasse of the Reichsbank in Berlin, where officials also summarized the accompanying letters noting that some property originated from the shooting of Jews.46 This demonstrates how the processing of property helped spread a certain awareness of the on-going Holocaust throughout Europe. What can such detailed property records tell us about the lives of the Jewish victims and their experience of the confiscation process? Detailed property inventories, whether created for the purposes of emigration or listing what remained at the time of deportation, can provide some image of how people lived. For survivors and the relatives of those who died, personal items, such as family portraits, photographs, or even furniture, provide a unique link with the past. The extensive records of both confiscation and restitution can provide valuable clues to the otherwise unknown fate of individuals. Such documents already provide a key resource for genealogists and local historians. The careful work of two scholars in Münster, reconstructing the lives of the local Jewish community with the aid of financial documentation, demonstrates the wealth of detail to be found in these records.47 Jewish memorial books and survivor memoirs are replete with harrowing descriptions of the progressive seizure of property, often viewed as a clear reflection of local antisemitism.48 In most occupied areas the Germans relied to a considerable extent on the cooperation of the local administration, institutions, and population.49 In the Netherlands, for instance, German officials expressed repeated concerns about the willingness of Dutch banks to comply fully with German registration and confiscation measures.50 The main problem facing the administration of Jewish property almost everywhere, however, was corruption rather than sabotage. Just as the Nazi Party and its members claimed their share of the spoils in the Reich, so collaborationist organizations, such as the Norwegian Nazi Party or the Belorussian Self-Help Organization, exploited access to Jewish property to reward themselves and their followers and to distribute patronage.51 A very important question is the extent to which collaborating regimes initiated confiscation measures themselves. For the French in particular, concerns to defend their own sovereignty with regard to the spoliation of the Jews encouraged them to seize the initiative in order to retain control of the process. In Romania the government introduced indigenous antisemitic legislation and plundering largely without direct German prompting. Many of the mechanisms, however, reflected similar measures in Germany, if there were also certain unique aspects to the “Romanianization” of the economy.52 In spite of the belated nature of measures taken in Hungary in 1944, the active participation of the Hungarian administration in the economic expropriation of the Jews reveals some autonomy from the Germans in this sphere.53 The work of Professor Seibel and his team of researchers examining the Holocaust and polycracy in Western Europe demonstrates the insights to be gained from the comparative study of such political horse-\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n28\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 28\n\nMartin Dean\n\ntrading or “log-rolling” as Seibel calls it, involved in the implementation of the seizure of Jewish assets.54 Who were the main beneficiaries from plundered Jewish property and where did the proceeds go? Despite the widespread incidence of private plunder and corruption, there is no doubt that the seizure of Jewish property in Europe was primarily a state-directed process linked closely to the development of the Holocaust. However, the widespread participation of the local population as beneficiaries from Jewish property served to spread complicity, and therefore also acceptance of German measures against the Jews, beyond the smaller circle of immediate perpetrators. In this way the Nazis and their collaborators were able to mobilize society in support of Nazi racial policies to a greater extent than the spread of racial antisemitism alone would have permitted. Thus the existence of “economic antisemitism” and opportunism must be incorporated into interpretations of the Holocaust based on Nazi ideological beliefs alone. Of particular interest might be a comparison of the number and nature of requests for Jewish property from the local population, which are surprisingly numerous in the archives of many countries. These frequently include assertions of one’s loyalty and service to the Nazi Party and regime; in Latvia one policeman even boasted of his active participation in anti-Jewish actions.55 Interpreting individual motivation is one of the hardest questions to answer on the basis of the available sources. Frequently, it is only possible to surmise people’s motives from the evidence of their words and deeds. Nevertheless a comparison of the treatment of Jewish property with other state expropriation policies, such as the treatment of Polish property (also confiscated by the Haupttreuhandstelle Ost) may shed further light both on the development of government measures and also the responses of society. The main divergences in the nature of property confiscation are those between its implementation in Eastern and Western Europe, derived mainly from Germany’s occupation policies. Nevertheless, there remain certain mechanisms and responses that are comparable throughout Europe, not least regarding the strategies followed by allies of Nazi Germany, where political considerations (often linked to Germany’s fortunes in the war) played a key role. In conclusion, what can we learn from a comparative perspective of the plunder and confiscation of Jewish property throughout Europe? The best use of comparative history is often to shed new light or gain a new perspective on aspects of national history that cannot be fully understood in isolation. The international and interrelated nature of property confiscation throughout Europe lends itself to detailed comparison for this reason. The recent work of national historical commissions, company historians, and other researchers has greatly increased our knowledge of the complex processes involved and also the archival resources available on property seizure.56 Going beyond the raw data, it is now appropriate to develop new interpretations and analyses using a broader comparative approach. Both\n\n02-Dean:02-Dean\n\n2/12/07\n\n10:39 AM\n\nPage 29\n\nThe Seizure of Jewish Property in Europe\n\n29\n\nthe implementation of spoliation and the extent of indigenous participation may be assessed more effectively in this international context. Ironically, just as property restitution cannot be fully understood without first researching the full extent of Aryanization, confiscation, and plunder, so too the study of these topics is now benefitting greatly from the gradual opening of the restitution archives and the intense international interest in resolving outstanding historical legacies. This in turn helps us to understand better the role of property issues within the development of the Holocaust itself. Despite the many obstacles to be overcome, the skillful application of comparative history can provide historians with fresh ammunition to pursue historical debates from a new angle using unconventional means.\n\nNotes 1.
