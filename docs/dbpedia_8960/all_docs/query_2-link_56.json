A. RUDENKO (Chief Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.): Mr. President, with the permission of the Tribunal, evidence on the count âDespoliation and Plunder of Private, Public, and National Propertyâ will be presented by the State Counsellor of Justice, Second Class, L. R. Shenin.\n\nSTATE COUNSELLOR OF JUSTICE OF THE SECOND CLASS L. R. SHENIN (Assistant Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.): May it please Your Honors, my task consists in presenting to the Tribunal evidence of the criminal and predatory motives of Hitlerite aggression and of the monstrous plundering of the peoples of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the U.S.S.R.\n\nMy colleagues have already proved that the attack on the U.S.S.R., as well as on other European countries, was planned and prepared beforehand by the criminal Hitlerite Government.\n\nI shall submit to the Tribunal a number of the conspiratorsâ original documents, statements, and speeches, which in the aggregate will prove that the despoliation and plunder of private, public, and national property in the occupied territories was also premeditated, planned, and prepared on a large scale, and that thus, simultaneously with the development of their purely military and strategic plans of attack, the Hitlerites with the cold-blooded deliberateness of professional robbers and murderers also developed and prepared beforehand the plan of organized plunder and marauding, after having minutely and accurately calculated their future profits, their criminal gains, their robbersâ spoils.\n\nThe official report of the Czechoslovak Government on the crimes committed by the Hitlerites on the territory of Czechoslovakia, the first victim of German aggression, has already been submitted to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-60 (Document Number USSR-60).\n\nIn the third section of this report there is a short extract from an article by Ley, published on 30 January 1940 in the Angriff. I quote:\n\nThis promise, this program of action, found its concrete expression in the fact that the Hitlerite conspirators subjected all territories occupied by them to unrestrained plunder, highly varied in form and method and entirely shameless in its devastating results. The report of the Czechoslovak Government contains a large number of examples corroborating the corresponding counts of the Indictment.\n\nI shall read this section into the record starting with the first paragraph on Page 72 of the Russian translation. I read:\n\nThe following characteristic fact is mentioned in the report, namely, the way in which Hitler became acquainted with Czechoslovakia, which he had just seized. I shall read into the record Subparagraph B of this section, entitled, âAfter the Invasion of 15 March 1939.â The Tribunal will find this excerpt on Pages 3 and 4 of the document book. I quote:\n\nOne of the methods of thoroughâI should say totalâplunder was the so-called economic Germanization. I submit to the Tribunal as evidence of these crimes the following extract from the official Czechoslovak report. This extract the Tribunal will find on Pages 4 and 5 of the document book:\n\nI skip one paragraph of this report and pass on to the next count:\n\nI skip the paragraph concerning the same methods adopted in the case of light industry and pass on to the next count of the report, âFinancial Spoliation.â\n\nGentlemen, further on in this report we find a detailed account of the Hitlerite campaign of spoliation directed against the financial economy of the Czechoslovak Republic. With a view to saving time I shall refrain from quoting this excerpt and shall merely submit the balance sheet of the Czechoslovak National Bank.\n\nI now quote an excerpt from the section entitled, âTaxesâ:\n\nGentlemen, the excerpt which I just read from the report of the Czechoslovak Government gives an adequate picture of the manner in which, after having seized Czechoslovakia, the Hitlerites subjected it to wanton plunder in every field of its economic lifeâagriculture, industry, and finance.\n\nHaving seized the entire economic resources of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Hitlerite Government forced this economy to serve their criminal interests, extracting everything possible in order to prepare for further aggression against the peoples of Europe and for new military attacks with the monstrous aim of achieving world domination by the German âmaster race.â\n\nI shall now pass to the reading of the fourth section of the official report of the Polish Government dealing with crimes committed by the Hitlerites in occupied Poland. This report has already been presented to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-93 (Document Number USSR-93) and, according to Article 21 of the Charter, constitutes irrefutable evidence. I quote an excerpt from this report which the Tribunal will find on Page 14 of the document book:\n\nI skip two pages of this report enumerating the companies which were specially created for carrying out of this plunder activity and also for plundering the Polish-Jewish population, which as is already known to the Tribunal, was later exterminated. I pass on to the end of the Polish Government report. The Tribunal will find this excerpt on Page 17 of the document book.\n\nMere quotations from these and other decrees may create a wrong impression as to the means used by the defendants in the case of the Jewish property in Poland. But it should be pointed out that steps concerning Jewish property were only preliminaries to infinitely greater crimes in the future. At the end of this section of the report is justly statedâI quote:\n\nIt is impossible to enumerate all the crimes committed in Poland under the direct leadership of the Defendant Frank, who was the head of all the administration in the so-called Government General.\n\nFrankâs diaries which were found and became part of the evidence in this case, give a clear and concrete idea of the crimes committed by the Hitlerites in Poland under his direction. In these diaries, Your Honors, are entries which have a direct bearing on the subject of my presentation.\n\nTherefore I should like, with your permission, to quote excerpts from this diary which have not yet been quoted.\n\nI quote from the volume entitled âConference of Departmental Heads for 1939-1940â (Document Number USSR-223), Pages 11 and 12. In your document book, gentlemen, this excerpt is on Page 21:\n\nFrom the volume entitled âDiary 1942â I quote:\n\nFrom the same volume, Page 1277âthis concerns the Governorâs conference which took place on 7 December 1942, in KrakÃ³wâmeasures for increasing production for the years 1942-43 were discussed. A certain Dr. Fischer stated:\n\nFrom the same volume on Page 1331, Frank speaks:\n\nThis same Frank on Page 1332 states the followingâthe Tribunal will find this quotation on Page 27 of the document book:\n\nIn the volume entitled âWorkers Conferences for 1943,â we find an excerpt concerning the conference of 14 April 1943, which took place in KrakÃ³w. On Page 28 of the document book, the Tribunal will find the excerpt which I wish to read into the record.\n\nOn Page 24 the same person continuesâthis total account is on Page 28 of the document book:\n\nAnd further:\n\nHowever, the quotation which I have read from Naumannâs reply in no way influenced the policy of the merciless plundering of the Polish people, whose fate, to use Frankâs own words, interested him from one angle only.\n\nIn the volume entitled âDiary, From 1 January to 28 February 1944â there is the following statement by Frank made at the conference of the leaders of German agriculture on 12 January 1944. The Tribunal will find this excerpt on Page 30 of the document book.\n\nI believe, Your Honors, that after this quotation there is no need for me, as a representative of the Soviet Prosecution, to add anything more to that section of my statement which deals with the crimes committed by the Hitlerite criminals on the territory of the Polish State. Indeed, any one of the sentences quoted is more than sufficient to give us an exact picture of the regime in Poland created by Frank, and of Frank himself, who created this regime.\n\nTurning now to the plunder and pillage of private and public property by the Hitlerites in Yugoslavia, I must, Your Honors, read the appropriate extracts of the official report of the Yugoslav Government, submitted to the International Military Tribunal by the Soviet Prosecution as Exhibit USSR-36 (Document Number USSR-36). This report, in accordance with Article 21 of the Charter, is submitted as irrefutable evidence.\n\nCount 6 of this report, entitled âPlunder of Public and Private Property,â reads as followsâthis count is on Page 32 of the document book:\n\nI submit to the Tribunal a certified photographic copy of the aforementioned proclamation as Exhibit Number USSR-140 (Document Number USSR-140).\n\nI submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-194 (Document Number USSR-194), âthe German decree of 30 June 1942 concerning the withdrawal of notes issued by the Reichskreditkasse and also a certified copy of the decree concerning the Serbian National Bank, of 29 May 1941,â as Exhibit Number USSR-135 (Document Number USSR-135).\n\nThe Tribunal will find this excerpt on Page 40 of the document book:\n\nThe Defendant GÃ¶ring, on 26 March 1943, issued a decree demanding a further decrease in the prices of all goods imported from the occupied countries.\n\nI submit to the Tribunal a certified copy of the above-mentioned decree as Exhibit Number USSR-206 (Document Number USSR-206).\n\nIn order to save time I skip a part of this section of the document which quotes concrete examples of the confiscation of property belonging to the Yugoslav population, and I pass on to the next count, which is entitled, âOther Methods of Plunder.â The members of the Tribunal will find this section on Page 52:\n\nI shall cite a few examples:\n\nThere are numerous examples of the same kind.\n\nFrom this Your Honors may see that the plunder of public and private property in Yugoslavia was conducted by the Hitlerites according to a preconceived plan, that it affected every class and every branch of the countryâs economy, and caused enormous material loss to the Yugoslav State and to its citizens.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT (Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence): I believe this would be a convenient time to recess.\n\n[A recess was taken.]\n\nMR. COUNSELLOR SHENIN: After the invasion of Greece, the Hitlerite conspirators pursued their policy of merciless despoliation of the occupied countries and immediately began to plunder her national property. The official report of the Greek Government on the crimes committed by the Hitlerites has already been submitted to the Tribunal.\n\nThe appropriate section of this report entitled, âExploitation,â gives the concrete facts of the plunder of public and private property in Greece. I quote the following excerpts from the part, âExploitation,â from this report of the Greek Government, which will be found on Page 59 of the document book:\n\nIn addition to requisitioning supplies for their armies, the Hitlerite conspirators exacted enormous sums of money from Greece to cover the so-called cost of occupation. In the report of the Greek Government the following remark is made on the subjectâthis is on Page 60 of the document bookâI read:\n\nAnother method of plundering Greece which the Hitlerites applied on a vast scale was the so-called requisitions and confiscations. In order to save time, I shall, with the permission of the Tribunal, merely read into the record a brief excerpt from the Greek report dealing with this question. I quote:\n\nAs the country was divided among three occupying powers, the Hitlerites blockaded that part of Greece which was occupied by their own troops and forbade the export of food supplies from that zone. The Hitlerites began to confiscate all existing stocks of food and other goods, a measure which reduced the population to a state of extreme misery and starvation. This plundering had such catastrophic consequences for the Greek nation that, finally, even the Germans themselves were forced to realize that they had gone too far. The practical result of this was that towards the end of 1942 the German authorities promised the International Commission of the Red Cross that they would return to the population all the local products confiscated and exported by the armies of occupation. The Germans also undertook to replace them by the importation of products of the same caloric value. This pledge was not fulfilled.\n\nAs in all the occupied countries, the Germans issued and put into circulation an unlimited amount of currency. It should be noted that this currency represented the so-called occupation marks without any security. I quote an excerpt from this report, which the members of the Tribunal will find on Page 63 in the document book. I read:\n\nThe Germans, after causing great inflation in that way, purchased all goods at prices fixed before the occupation. All goods purchased, as well as valuables, articles of gold, furniture, and so forth, were shipped by the Germans to Germany.\n\nFinally, as in every country they occupied, the Hitlerites put into operation in Greece also the so-called âclearing system.â Under this system, all goods earmarked for export were first confiscated or put under embargo by the military authorities. Then they were bought up by German firms at arbitrarily fixed prices. The price of the goods established in this one-sided way was then credited to Greece. The prices for merchandise imported from Germany were fixed at from 200 to 500 percent higher than their normal value. Finally, Greece was also debited with the price of merchandise imported from Germany for the needs of the occupation forces. The Germans called this cynical method of plundering âclearing.â\n\nI quote a short excerpt from the report of the Greek Government which the members of the Tribunal will find on Page 64 of the document book. I read:\n\nIn this way, Your Honors, the Hitlerites plundered the Greek people.\n\nMay it please Your Honors, I pass on to the statement of the facts of the monstrous plunder and pillage to which private, public, and state property was subjected by the Hitlerite usurpers in the temporarily occupied territories of the Soviet Union. The irrefutable original documents which I shall have the honor to present for your consideration, Your Honors, will prove that long before their attack on the U.S.S.R., the fascist conspirators had conceived and prepared their criminal plans for the plunder and spoliation of its riches and of its national wealth.\n\nLike all other military crimes committed by the Hitlerites in countries occupied by them, the plunder and pillage of these territories was planned and organized beforehand by the major war criminals whom the determination and valor of the Allied nations have brought to justice.\n\nThe crimes committed by those who carried out the conspiratorsâ criminal plans over wide areas of the Soviet land, on the fertile steppes of the Ukraine, in the fields and forests of Bielorussia, in the rich cornfields of the Kuban and the Don, in the blossoming gardens of the Crimea, in the approaches to Leningrad and in the Soviet Baltic Statesâall these monstrous crimes, all this mass plunder and wholesale pillage of the sacred wealth created by the peaceable and honest work of the Soviet peoples, Russian, Ukrainian, Bielorussian, and othersâall these crimes were directly planned, designed, prepared, and organized by the criminal Hitlerite Government and the Supreme Command of Armed Forcesâthe major war criminals, now occupying the dock.\n\nI shall begin with evidence as to the premeditated nature of the crimes committed on U.S.S.R. territory. I shall prove that the wholesale indiscriminate pillage of private, public, and state property committed by the German fascist usurpers was not an isolated occurrence, not a local phenomenon. It was not the result of the disintegration or the thefts of individual army units but was, on the contrary, an essential and indissoluble part of the general plan of attack on the U.S.S.R. and represented, moreover, the fundamental purpose, the chief motive underlying this criminal aggression.\n\nMay I beg the indulgence of the Tribunal if, in stating the facts connected with the preparations for this type of crimes, I am obliged to refer very briefly also to several of the documents already submitted to the Tribunal by my American colleagues. I shall endeavor, however, to avoid repetitions and shall mainly quote such extracts from these documents as have not been previously read into the record.\n\nIt is known that simultaneously with the elaboration of âPlan Barbarossa,â which provided for all strategic questions connected with the attack on the U.S.S.R., purely economic problems arising from the plan were elaborated.\n\nIn the document known under the title, âConference of 29 April 1941 with Branches of the Armed Forces,â and presented to the Tribunal by the American prosecution on 10 December as Document Number 1157-PS, we read:\n\nFurther on in this document it is indicated that the FÃ¼hrer, contrary to previous practice in the preparation measures envisaged, ordered that all economic questions were to be worked out by one center and that this center is to be âthe special-purpose economic staff Oldenburg under the direction of Lieutenant General Schubertâ and that it is to be under the Reich Marshal, that is, GÃ¶ring. Thus, as early as April 1941, the Defendant GÃ¶ring was in charge of all preparations for plundering the U.S.S.R.\n\nTo finish with this document, I should like to recall that provision is made in it, even at that early date, for the organization of special economic inspectorates and commands at Leningrad, Murmansk, Riga, Minsk, Moscow, Tula, Gorki, Kiev, Baku, Yaroslavl, and many other Soviet industrial towns. The document points out that the tasks of these inspectorates and commands included âthe economic utilization of suitable territoryâ that is, as is explained below, âall questions of food supply and rural economy, industrial economy, including raw materials and manufactured articles; forestry, finance and banking, museums, commerce, trade, and manpower.â As you see, Your Honors, the tasks were extremely wide and extraordinarily concrete.\n\nThe Plan Barbarossa-Oldenburg was further developed in the so-called âdirectives for economic management of the newly occupied eastern territoriesâ which were also elaborated and issued secretly before the attack on the U.S.S.R.\n\nBefore passing on to the âGreen Fileâ I should like to present to the Tribunal and read but in part another documentâthe so-called âFile of the District Agricultural Leader,â which was submitted to the Tribunal by my colleague Colonel Smirnov as Document Number USSR-89. These very detailed instructions for future district agricultural leaders which were also worked out and published in advance, bore the title of âDistrict Agricultural Leaders File,â and were dated 1 June 1941. Naturally this document, too, is also marked âtop secret.â\n\nThis instruction begins, â12 Commandments for the Behavior of Germans in the East and Their Attitude towards Russians.â My colleague, Colonel Smirnov, read into the record only one of those commandments: and I, with the Tribunalâs permission, shall read into the record the other commandments. The first commandment statesâthe members of the Tribunal will find it on Page 69 of the document book. I read:\n\nWhat sort of âworkâ is meant is clearly shown by the following commandments. I quote extracts from this document:\n\nIn this way the future âagricultural leadersâ were not only ordered to be implacable, merciless, and cruel in their plundering activities, but were also warned of what would happen to them if they were not implacable enough or if they showed âlack of character.â\n\nThe following commandments develop the same idea:\n\nSuch were these commandments for agricultural leaders, which one shouldâto be more exactâcall âcommandments for cannibals.â The file begins with these âcommandments,â which are followed by a perfectly clear-cut program for the plundering of U.S.S.R. agriculture. At the beginning of this program we read:\n\nAs you see, Your Honors, a perfectly clear and candid formulation of the aims of the attack on the U.S.S.R. is given. Of course, it does not exhaust these aims. This aim was not confined to the stealing of provisions, and provisions were far from being the only thing stolen. This is only an extract from the agricultural leadersâ file, and they were not the only people to be entrusted with tasks of pillage and to perform these tasks.\n\nThe file as a whole contains the following sections of a carefully thought out and extremely concrete program for the plunder of the Soviet Unionâs agriculture. I read the table of contents. Your Honors will find this document on Page 67 of the document book:\n\nI am not, Your Honor, going to take up your time by reading the whole of this document, which consists of 98 typewritten pages. I am presenting it to the Tribunal in its entirety, to be included in the files of the Trial.\n\nI shall read from this document, already presented to the Tribunal by my American colleagues on 10 December of last year as Exhibit Number USA-147 (Document 1058-PS), only a few short lines. It is a note of the record of a speech made by Rosenberg at a secret conference on 20 June 1941, dealing with questions of the East. In his speech, Rosenberg stated particularly:\n\nThus did the leaders of Hitlerite Germany formulate the tasks they set themselves when preparing their attack on the Soviet Union.\n\nAlready in August 1942âthat is, from 26 to 28 AugustâGauleiter Koch, who had just arrived from Hitlerâs headquarters, spoke at the conference in Rovno. The record of this conference was found in Rosenbergâs archives. This document was kindly put at our disposal by our American colleagues. It is registered as Document Number 264-PS, but it has not been presented to the Tribunal.\n\nI read into the record an excerpt from this record. The members of the Tribunal will find it on Page 72 in the document book. I read:\n\nI shall show later how far this original figureâ3 million tons of grainâwas exceeded by the Hitlerite plunderers, whose avid appetites grew from month to month.\n\nAll these aims of plunder had been planned in advance by the criminal Hitlerite Government, who worked out an organized scheme for carrying out organized plunder and practical methods of pillaging the occupied territories.\n\nWith the Tribunalâs permission I shall read extracts from a secret document by Reich Marshal GÃ¶ring which was captured by units of the Red Army. This document bears the title, âDirectives for Economic Management in the Newly Occupied Areas in the East (Green File),â and extracts of it have already been mentioned by my colleagues. This document is presented by the Soviet Prosecution as Exhibit Number USSR-10 (Document Number USSR-10).\n\nThe title page of the document readsâPage 76 of the document book:\n\nAs is clear from the text of the document, these directives were published immediately before Germanyâs attack on the U.S.S.R. âfor the information of military and economic authorities regarding economic tasks in the eastern territories to be occupied.â\n\nIn setting forth the âmain economic tasksâ the directives state in the first paragraph:\n\nI omit the next part of the excerpt, and I pass on to the following excerpt, which the members of the Tribunal will find on Page 78:\n\nI omit the rest of this quotation in order to save time.\n\nFurther, the plan devised in advance for the organized plunder of the Soviet Union provided in detail for the removal from the U.S.S.R. to Germany of all raw materials, supplies, and stocks of goods available. In confirmation of this I cite excerpts from this document so that I shall not have to read it in full. The members of the Tribunal will find these excerpts on Page 83, 87, and 88 of the document book:\n\nPage 88âfrom the section âRaw Material and the Exploitation of Commercial Resourcesâ:\n\nBack of Page 87:\n\nBack of Page 83âin the section of the directives entitled âEconomic Organizationâ we find a project of an apparatus with wide ramifications which was to carry out this organized plunder of the U.S.S.R. I shall read a series of excerpts from this section, which the members of the Tribunal will find on Page 79 of the document book:\n\nSecond excerpt:\n\nIn directing your attention to these two excerpts, Your Honors, I consider it definitively proved that the Defendant GÃ¶ring not only had personal charge of the preparations for the plunder of private, public, and state property, but later on directed personally the vast apparatus specially set up for these criminal purposes. You can judge of the projected organization of this apparatus, by the following extracts from the Green File. I read:\n\nFurther on, in Paragraph 4 of this same section, under the title âStructure of the Individual Economic Institutionsâ the whole plan of construction of the Economic Staff East is described. I shall cite it in my own words in order to save time. The members of the Tribunal will find the document to which I refer at the back of Page 79 in the document book.\n\nChief of the Economic Staff with the leadership group (field of activity, leadership questions, also manpower); Group IA, in charge of food and agriculture, running the entire agricultural production and also the assembling of supplies for the army; Group W, in charge of industry, raw materials, forestry, finance, banking property, and trade; Group M, in charge of troop requirements, armaments, and transport; economic inspectorates attached to army groups, in charge of the economic exploitation of the rear area. Economic task forces organized in the zone of each security division and consisting of one officer as commander, and several specialists in different branches of the work. Economic groups attached to the field commands, who are responsible for supplying the immediate requirements of the troops stationed within the sphere of activity of the field command and for preparing the economic exploitation of the country in the interests of war economy.\n\nTo these economic groups were attached experts on manpower, food production and agriculture, industrial economy and general economic questions; the economic section, attached to the army command, with special technical battalions and platoons as well as special intelligence subsections for industrial research, particularly in the field of raw materials and crude oil, and subsections for discovering and securing agricultural produce and machines, including tractors.\n\nThis same plan also provides for special technical units for crude oilâbattalions and companiesâand also the so-called mining battalions.\n\nThus, under the direct control of the Defendant GÃ¶ring, a whole army of plunderers of all ranks and branches was provided, prepared, trained, and drilled in advance for the organized pillage and looting of the national property of the U.S.S.R.\n\nYour Honors, I will not take up your time by reading the whole text of the Green File; I shall limit myself to enumerating its remaining sections, which bear the following titlesâPage 77 in the document book:\n\nThus the plunder of all branches of the U.S.S.R.âs national economy was foreseen.\n\nTo conclude I shall read into the record Keitelâs order, dated 16 June 1941, 6 days before the attack on the U.S.S.R., in which he instructed all military units of the German Army to be ready to execute all the directives of the Green File. I shall now read this orderâyou will find this, Your Honors, at the back of Page 89 of the document book:\n\nI omit the second part of this order which contains detailed instructions as to how the directives of the Green File should be executed, and I read only the last paragraph of Keitelâs order:\n\nThe concluding provision of this document, which says that âthe exploitation of the country must be carried out on a wide scaleâ was strictly observed by units of the German Army; and the occupied regions of the U.S.S.R., from the very first day of the war, were subjected to the most merciless plunder. In confirmation of this, I shall later present to the Tribunal a series of original German documents, orders, directives, instructions, decrees, and so forth, issued by German military authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, to finish with the Green File, I may state in conclusion that this striking document is definite evidence of the remarkable qualifications for plunder and the vast experience in brigandage of the Hitlerite conspirators.\n\nThe program for plundering the occupied territories of the Soviet Union, conceived on a wide scale and elaborated in detail by the conspirators, was put into practice by the Hitlerite aggressors from the very first days of their attack on the U.S.S.R.\n\nApart from the organized plunder carried out by the vast apparatus specially formed for this purposeâan apparatus consisting of all kinds of agricultural leaders, inspectors, specialists in economics, technical and intelligence battalions and companies, economic groups and detachments, military agronomists, and so forthâthe so-called âmaterial interestâ of the German soldiers and officers, who had unlimited possibilities of robbing the civilian population and sending their booty to Germany, was widely encouraged by the Hitlerite Government and the High Command of the German Army.\n\nThe universal plundering of the population of the towns and villages of the occupied territories of the U.S.S.R. and the mass removal to Germany of the personal property of Soviet citizens, the property taken from the collective farms and co-operative unions and the property of the State itself, was carried out according to a prearranged plan wherever the German fascist aggressors appeared.\n\nI turn, Your Honors, to the presentation of individual Soviet Government documents on this question. A few months after Hitlerite Germanyâs treacherous attack on the U.S.S.R., the Soviet Government had already received irrefutable data about the war crimes committed by the Hitlerite armies in the Soviet territories they occupied.\n\nMy colleagues have already presented to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-51 a note of the Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R., Molotov, dated 6 January 1942.\n\nIn order to avoid repetition and to save time, I shall read only a few excerpts from this note which have a direct bearing on the subject of my presentation. You will find the quoted extracts, underlined on Page 100 of the document book:\n\nThe last paragraph of this quotation:\n\nIn order to save time I shall not read the next paragraphs of this note, but shall give an account of them to the Tribunal in my own words. They contain a whole series of concrete facts of the looting of the peaceful population in different regions of the Soviet Union and the names of the victims as well as the list of such things and belongings as were taken from these peaceful citizens. Further, this note reads as follows:\n\nSeveral months later, on 27 April 1942, in connection with the information which continued to come in regarding the crimes committed by the German fascist armies, Molotov, Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R., published for the second time a note on the monstrous misdeeds, atrocities, and acts of violence of the German fascist invaders in occupied Soviet territories and on the responsibility of the German Government and the High Command for these crimes. This second note is also submitted to the Tribunal. . .\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: General, what do you mean by âpublishedâ?\n\nMR. COUNSELLOR SHENIN: What I mean is that this note was first sent to all the governments with whom the U.S.S.R. Government maintained diplomatic relations. The text of the note was also published in the Soviet official press.\n\nThis document has already been presented by the Soviet Prosecution as Exhibit Number USSR-51 (Document Number USSR-51). I shall read a few brief excerpts from this document which have a direct bearing on the subject of my presentation.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Perhaps we had better adjourn now, and you can read it after the adjournment.\n\n[The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.]\n\nAfternoon Session\n\nMARSHAL (Colonel Charles W. Mays): May it please the Court: I desire to announce that the Defendant Streicher will be absent on account of illness.\n\nMR. COUNSELLOR SHENIN: I shall read now excerpts from the note of the Peopleâs Commissar. . .\n\n[The proceedings were interrupted by technical difficulties in the interpreting system.]\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.\n\n[A recess was taken.]\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Owing to the delay the Tribunal will sit until half past 5 tonight without further adjournment.\n\nYes, Colonel.\n\nMR. COUNSELLOR SHENIN: I am reading into the record excerpts from the note by the Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign Affairs dated 27 April 1942, and in order to save time I shall, with your permission, quote only a few of the most necessary excerpts from this note. They are very short. In this note, attention was drawn to the fact that the documents captured by the Soviet authorities and put at the disposal of the Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign Affairs are evidence of the premeditated nature of the plunder carried out by the Hitlerites.\n\nI read the following excerpts; last paragraph on Page 44 of my statement, Russian text.\n\nI omit the rest of the quotation from Mr. Molotovâs note and conclude with the last paragraph:\n\nI omit the remainder of this quotation which gives an inventory of all property, cattle, and fowl confiscated by the invaders from 25 districts of the Tula region.\n\nYour Honors, the notes which I have read, mention only a few of the innumerable crimes and cases of plunder committed by the Hitlerites on Soviet soil.\n\nWith the permission of the Tribunal I shall now present several German documents from which you will see how the German commanders and officials themselves described their soldiersâ behavior. Later I shall read candid statements by the German fascist leaders saying that German soldiers and officers must not be hindered in their marauding activities. It is natural that under these conditions the moral disintegration of the German fascist armies should reach its culminating point. Things reached such a point that the Hitlerites begin to plunder each other, thereby proving the truth of the well-known Russian proverb, âA thief stole a cudgel from a thief.â\n\nMay I now quote from the document which I present to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-285. This is an extract from a report of the German District Commissioner of Zhitomir to the Commissioner General of Zhitomir dated 30 November 1943. You will find the document to which I refer on Page 93 in the document book. I read:\n\nI read the second excerpt from the same document:\n\nNow I shall read into the record an excerpt from a report of the German District Commissioner of the town of Korostyshev to the Commissioner General of Zhitomir. The members of the Tribunal will find this excerpt on Page 94 of the document book.\n\nI read into the record other excerpts from the same document:\n\nAnd the second excerpt:\n\nThen the third excerpt:\n\nAnd the last excerpt:\n\nIn these towns; Your Honors, is the conduct of the German soldiers depicted by a German commissioner in his official report.\n\nThere is no doubt that this description is an objective one, especially since it is supplemented by an official report of the German Ukrainian company for supplying agriculture in the Commissariat General, addressed to the Commissioner General of Zhitomir. This is how the report describes the results of a raid by German soldiers on the companyâs premises, â. . . The office was in a horrifying and incredible condition.â Second excerpt:\n\nI skip a few lines:\n\nI omit two more excerpts from the document.\n\nSuch, Your Honors, is the heartcry of the German brigands of the company for the economic adoption of the Ukraine, who themselves complain of the brigands in the German Army.\n\nIn order to show that it was not only in Zhitomir and Korostyshev that such things took place, I shall quote yet another report, this time by the Commissioner of the Kazatinsky district, which contains the following statement, â. . . The German soldiers stole food, cattle, and vehicles.â This laconic but significant introduction is followed by no less significant details:\n\nThe chief of the main department, Dr. Moisich, relates the same story in a report to the Commissioner General of Zhitomir, dated 4 December 1943. All these documents are being presented in their original form to the Tribunal.\n\nI shall now, Your Honors, proceed to read excerpts from the official reports and communiques of the Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union for the investigation and establishment of crimes committed by the German intruders and their accomplices. In order to save time, I ask the Tribunal to permit me to read only a few excerpts from these documents, and to give you the contents of the rest in my own words.\n\nThe report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the looting and crimes perpetrated by the Hitlerites in the city and district of Rovno has already been submitted to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-45. The corresponding section of this report reads as follows:\n\nI shall not quote all the data mentioned in this report of the Extraordinary State Commission. The report made by the Extraordinary State Commission on the atrocities committed by the Hitlerites in Kiev, and submitted to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-9, emphasizes the fact that the Hitlerites plundered the peaceful population of Kiev. I quote a brief extract, âThe German occupation forces in the city of Kiev looted factory equipment and carried it off to Germany.â\n\nFollowing the directives of the criminal German Government and the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces, the satellite states also joined in plundering and other crimes. Romanian troops who temporarily occupied Odessa along with German Armed Forces plundered this flourishing city in accordance with instructions from their German masters. The report of the Extraordinary State Commission concerning the crimes committed by German and Romanian invaders in Odessa reads in part as follows:\n\nThe report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the damages inflicted by the German fascist invaders on industry, urban economy, and cultural and educational institutions in the Stalino region, already presented to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-2, also gives a good deal of data on the looting and removal to Germany of the factory equipment of this important industrial region.\n\nI have quoted only a few of the reports compiled by the Extraordinary State Commission on certain districts of the Ukraine. This flourishing Soviet republic was subjected to unrestrained looting by the Hitlerites. The Hitlerite conspirators considered the Ukraine a tidbit and plundered her with exceptional voracity. I should like to read several documents in proof of the above.\n\nRosenbergâs letter to Reichsleiter Bormann dated 17 October 1944. This document which has already been submitted on 17 December by the United States Prosecution under Exhibit Number USA-338 (Document Number 327-PS) states that the Central Trading Company for the East for marketing of agricultural produce sent the following goods to Germany in the period between 1943 and 31 March 1944 only:\n\nThe Defendant Rosenberg reported his âagricultural achievementsâ to Hitlerâs closest assistant in these terms.\n\nIt should be noted that during the first year of the war the voracity shown by the Hitlerites in plundering the Ukraine was so great, that it awakened certain misgivings even in themselves.\n\nI shall read an excerpt from a letter addressed by the Inspector of Armaments in the Ukraine to the Infantry General Thomas, Chief of the Economic Armament Office of the OKW. The letter is dated 2 December 1941. This document was submitted to the Tribunal by the United States Prosecution on 14 December as Document Number 3257-PS. I read a short excerpt:\n\nHaving outlined this program, the author explains further:\n\nI omit the next paragraphs of this quotation.\n\nHowever, the Reich Commissioner for the Ukraine, Koch, went steadily on with his policy of ruthlessly plundering the Ukraine. In due course I shall submit to you numerous further documents, also in the original, in confirmation of the above. Kochâs policy met with the approbation of the Hitlerite Government.\n\nIt is worthy of note that at the beginning of the war the plundering of the occupied territories of the U.S.S.R. was organized in accordance with the directives contained in the Green File, already mentioned. I submit to the Tribunal, as Exhibit Number USSR-13 (Document Number USSR-13), a letter by GÃ¶ring dated 6 September 1941 on the subject of inspection for the seizure and utilization of raw materials, in which, among other things, the following passage occursâthe Tribunal will find this excerpt on Page 131 of the document book:\n\nI omit the last part of the quotation.\n\nLater however, when the Germans set up their so-called civil administration and organized a number of special economic bodies in various occupied territories including the Ukraine, in particular, disputes arose among the numerous German military and civil bodies and organizations, all of whom were engaged in plundering the occupied territories. Rosenberg, as Reich Minister for the Eastern Occupied Territories, began to insist that all military and economic organizations in the Ukraine were to be liquidated and their functions transferred to German civil administrations.\n\nI submit to the Tribunal a draft report for State Secretary KÃ¶rner on this subject, dated 3 December 1943, as Exhibit Number USSR-180 (Document Number USSR-180). I read from it:\n\nI omit the rest. In the same draft are detailed objections made by General Stapf and submitted by him to Keitel. He criticizes Rosenbergâs suggestion and advises the retention of the Economic Staff East.\n\nAnd now, with the permission of the Tribunal, I present as Exhibit Number USSR-174 (Document Number USSR-174), another original document which is a covering letter from the Permanent Deputy of the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories to State Secretary KÃ¶rner on the same subject.\n\nWritten suggestions by Rosenberg were appended to this letter in which Rosenberg insists that the entire economic activities be placed under the control of his ministry once more. As this is a rather long document and I am presenting it in the original, I ask your permission not to read it since it is mainly concerned with Rosenbergâs proposal, which I have already described to the Tribunal. For the information of the interpretersâI omit two pages of my presentation and pass to Page 62.\n\nEvidently Rosenberg did not receive the answer he wanted, so on 24 January 1944 he again wrote to GÃ¶ring on the same subject. I submit this letter as Exhibit Number USSR-179 (Document Number USSR-179). In this letter Rosenberg suggestsâI shall read into the record a short quotation, which the Tribunal will find on Page 151 of the document book:\n\nGÃ¶ring replied to this in a letter dated 14 February, which I offer in evidence as part of the same Exhibit Number USSR-179. I quote:\n\nThus, Your Honors, Rosenbergâs claims met with resistance on the part of other German authorities who stubbornly refused to give up such a choice âeconomic activity.â\n\nRosenberg in his turn refused to yield and continued to press his demands. I now offer in evidence the following document, Exhibit Number USSR-173 (Document Number USSR-173)âthis is a letter from Rosenberg to GÃ¶ring dated 6 March 1944. In this letter, Rosenberg refers to his experience in Bielorussia and again urges his proposals. It is a long document and I shall not read it, as it is presented to the Tribunal in toto. But GÃ¶ring still had his doubts and decided against Rosenberg.\n\nOn 6 April 1944, a month after the above-mentioned letter was sent off, Rosenberg again wrote to GÃ¶ring. This document I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-176 (Document Number USSR-176). May I omit reading it into the record, since in substance it is like the last; and the arguments advanced in it are not such as to interest us greatly now. I omit Page 65 and pass on to Page 66.\n\nThus, Your Honors, even when the Red Army was delivering its last crippling blows against the German fascist hordes, the Hitlerite brigands went on quarreling about the spoils. I think there is no need to prove that while this haggling continued, the occupied territories were looted in feverish haste by the German authorities, both military and civil.\n\nNow, Your Honors, I shall read some brief excerpts from the report made by the Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union on the crimes committed by the Hitlerite invaders in the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian Soviet Socialist Republics, which were also mercilessly plundered by the German fascist aggressors.\n\nAll these reports have been already presented to the Tribunal by the Soviet Prosecution. The report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the crimes of the Hitlerites in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic contains the following statement:\n\nI shall now quote excerpts from the report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the crimes committed by the German invaders in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. For the information of the interpretersâthis quotation is on Page 68, second paragraph:\n\nSecond quotation:\n\nFurther, I shall read a short excerpt from the report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the Estonian S.S.R.: I quote:\n\nI omit part of the quotation and I read the second paragraph on the next page:\n\nI omit one more paragraph and I read the last quotation from this report:\n\nYour Honors, a similar policy of plundering private, public, and national property was also carried out by the German fascist invaders in the occupied territories of Bielorussia, Moldavia, the Karelo-Finnish S.S.R. and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.\n\nVarious military units and organizations in different districts of the U.S.S.R. employed the same methods of plunder at all stages of the war in accordance with the same criminal plan and in pursuit of the same criminal aims. This plan was worked out, these aims were determined, these crimes were organized by the major war criminals who are now in the dock.\n\nThe U.S.S.R. Prosecution has at its disposal tens of thousands of documents on this subject. The presentation of all these numerous documents to the Tribunal would require such a long time that it would only complicate the Trial. For this reason, with the Tribunalâs permission, I shall not quote any further documents or reports of the Extraordinary State Commission on separate regions and republics, but I shall read into the record the statistical report of the Extraordinary State Commission relative to the material damage done by the German fascists to state enterprises and establishments, collective farms, public organizations, and individual citizens of the U.S.S.R.\n\nThis document is being presented to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-35 (Document Number USSR-35). I shall read into the record only those extracts from the report which have a direct bearing on the subject of my presentation. They are stated as followsâPage 71 of the statement:\n\nThe Extraordinary State Commission calculates the damage done to the national economy of the Soviet Union and to individual villagers and townspeople at 679,000 millions of rubles reckoned at the official prices current in 1941 as follows:\n\nI omit the following sections of this report, which describe how this damage is divided among separate Soviet Republics, and I pass on to the fourth paragraph, which describes the destruction of collective farms, State farms, and machine tractor stations. In order to save time, I shall confine myself to a few separate excerpts:\n\nFurther, some concrete data are given on the plundering in the Kamenetz-Podolsk and the Kursk region, the collective farm âFor Peace and Workâ in the region of Krasnodar, the collective farms âFor the Timesâ in the Stalino region, as well as collective farms in Mogilev and Zhitomir districts and others. The German fascist invaders inflicted great damage on the State farms of the U.S.S.R. They shipped out of collective farms all stocks of agricultural products and destroyed farm and other buildings belonging to the state farms.\n\nAnother excerpt:\n\nI omit the remaining excerpt of this section; and I pass on to Paragraph 6, which deals with the mass looting of Soviet citizensâ property by the Germans:\n\nThe same section contains a whole series of concrete facts of the plunder of Soviet citizens in Smolensk, Orel and Leningrad Provinces; the Dniepropetrovsk and Sumsky Provinces, et cetera. With the Tribunalâs permission, I omit two pages of my presentation, and I read the following paragraph at the bottom of Page 76:\n\nThe above documents and reports of the Extraordinary State Commission depict the crimes committed by the Hitlerites in the occupied territories of the U.S.S.R. These crimes had been organized by the defendants.\n\nThe fact that GÃ¶ring, in his capacity as Reich Marshal and Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan of the Hitlerite Government, was directly in charge of all the operations of the German military and civil authorities for the preparation and execution of despoliation of the occupied territories, is clearly shown by the documents which I have already presented. Nevertheless, I beg the indulgence of the Tribunal to read the final document on this matter, that is, the decree issued by Hitler on 29 June 1941.\n\nA copy of this decree was kindly put at our disposal by the American Prosecution, and it has not yet been presented. I, therefore, present it to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-287 (Document Number USSR-287). This decree reads as follows:\n\nHowever, Your Honors, the granting of extraordinary powers to GÃ¶ring does not, in any way, mean that the other defendants took only a passive interest in organizing the looting of the occupied territories. All of them, jointly and separately, worked feverishly in this direction. Frank robbed the Poles; Rosenberg managed affairs in the Ukraine and in the other occupied territories of the U.S.S.R.; Sauckel and Seyss-Inquart were busy here and there; Speer and Funk made schemes for and carried out predatory measures within the scope of the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry for Armament and War Production, while Keitel acted in the field of the Armed Forces.\n\nIn this connection I should like to submit to the Tribunal two more documents relating to Keitelâs economic activities. These documents, Your Honors, are presented to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-175 (Document Number USSR-175). On 29 August 1942 Keitel, in his capacity of Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces, issued the following order under âNumber 002865/42-g.Kdos. regarding securing of supplies for the Armed Forces.â I shall read only two short excerpts from this order. Your Honors will find them on Page 181 of the document book. I read:\n\nThe second excerpt:\n\nIn a memorandum by section chiefs Klare and Dr. Bergmann, dated, â19 November 1942, most secret, subject: Procurement of Supplies for the Armed ForcesââI submit this memorandum in the original to the Tribunal under the same number, Document Number USSR-175âwe find the following estimate of the results achieved by the above-mentioned order from Keitel. I now read into the record only the first paragraph of this memorandum.\n\nNow with Your Honorâs permission, I shall read into the record one more document, namely, a telegram sent by Keitel on 8 September 1944. This document was kindly put at our disposal by the American Prosecution and registered as Document Number 743-PS. It was not presented to the Tribunal before; I therefore submit it now as Exhibit Number USSR-286, and I quote:\n\nI read this text as follows:\n\nThus, Your Honors, even at the end of 1944, when under the blows of the Red Army and its allies Hitlerite Germany was precipitated towards its final defeat and only a few months before its final military and political collapse, Hitler, Keitel, Koch, and many others were still stretching out their already stiffening fingers to grab the property and wealth of others.\n\nThis is the evidence I have to show regarding the looting and marauding perpetrated by the Hitlerite hordes in the occupied territories of the Soviet Union. But they plundered not only the living, they also plundered the dead. My colleague, Colonel Smirnov, has already presented comprehensive evidence on this question. I do not wish to quote it again, but I refer to it only to show how closely interlocked and all-embracing was the circle of their crimes. As Rauschning testifies in his book, which has already been presented by the Soviet Prosecution to the Tribunal, Hitler once said:\n\nAnd Hitler actually found these men in the persons of the defendants and their numerous accomplices.\n\nAs the documents which I have just presented show, the Defendant GÃ¶ring, on account of his position in Hitlerâs Government as Reich Marshal and Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan and as head of the whole criminal system for the plundering of the occupied territories, was guilty of these crimes.\n\nFor this reason the stenographic record of a secret conference of German administrative leaders (Reich Commissioners) for the occupied countries, which took place on 6 August 1942, is of particular interest. GÃ¶ring presided over the meeting. This document, like many other original documents which I had the honor of presenting today to the Tribunal, was found by Soviet military authorities in September 1945 in one of the municipal buildings of the town of Jena, in Thuringia.\n\nThis extraordinary document contains a long speech by GÃ¶ring and the replies of the Hitlerite rulers of the occupied countries. And, Your Honors, many of the people who are sitting in the dock now took part in this conference. The contents of this document are such that any comment on my part is unnecessary. Therefore, if it pleases the Tribunal, I shall proceed to read from this document.\n\nGÃ¶ring then goes on to say:\n\nAnd now I come to the next excerpt:\n\nMr. President, I see one of the German Defense Counsel wishes to take the floor. I shall, therefore, give him an opportunity to do so.\n\nDR. ALFRED THOMA (Counsel for Defendant Rosenberg): Mr. President, I have only a short question.\n\nThe prosecutor has not told us where this document can be found, in which document book and what number it has. He mentioned only the page on which the Court can find that document.\n\nMR. COUNSELLOR SHENIN: This document was presented to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-170. The photostatic copy was turned over to Defense Counsel.\n\nMay I continue, Mr. President?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It comes from the archives of the Defendant GÃ¶ring, does it not? You have so stated.\n\nMR. COUNSELLOR SHENIN: Yes.\n\nI quote the next excerpt:\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe next excerpt from this address concerns the quotas to be fixed for deliveries from countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and the Government General. In reply to GÃ¶ringâs questions and instructions definite figures were quoted by those attending the meeting. I omit one page and continue:\n\nPassing to the next quotationâGÃ¶ring is speaking:\n\nThe next quotationâGÃ¶ring is still speaking:\n\nAfter this Lohse, Reich Commissioner for Bielorussia, addressed the meeting:\n\nLohse goes on to describe the activities of the partisans in Bielorussia. In this connection GÃ¶ring interrupts him and says:\n\nAnd Lohse answered:\n\nIn conclusion I quote the last three quotations from GÃ¶ringâs speech. He said:\n\nThe discussion went on in the same way. GÃ¶ringâs speech ends with the following sentence:\n\nAs Your Honors have heard, besides GÃ¶ring this conference was attended by the Defendants Rosenberg, Sauckel, Seyss-Inquart, Frank, Funk, and others. As you have heard, GÃ¶ring finished his speech with a direct threat against the participants in this conference, by saying that âwe shall have to meet on a different level.â This threat came true. The matter has, in every sense of the term, been met on a different levelâfrom the level of the dock.\n\nThus the whole volume of evidence submitted establishes beyond all doubt:\n\n1. That simultaneously with their well-laid preparations for the military invasion of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the U.S.S.R., the criminal Hitlerite Government and the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces worked out a plan for the mass plunder and spoliation of private, public, and state-owned property in the territories belonging to these countries.\n\n2. That having worked out this criminal plan, the conspirators carried out all the preliminary measures necessary for its execution by training special bodies of officers and officials for the despoliation of the territories they meant to seize by preparing and issuing special instructions, reference books, and orders for this purpose, and by creating a special and very complicated organization of all sorts of âeconomic inspectorates,â âdetachments,â âgroups,â âjoint stock companies,â âplenipotentiaries,â et cetera, and by calling in a large number of specialists in different branches, military experts on agriculture, agricultural leaders, economic spies, et cetera.\n\n3. That in accordance with this long-prepared plan, they subsequently plundered and despoiled private, public, and State property in the occupied territories and also robbed the peaceful population of these territories, having recourse to atrocities, violence, and arbitrary practices of the most appalling nature.\n\n4. That in order to make the soldiers and the officers of the German Army âeconomically interestedâ in the war, the conspirators not only failed to prosecute cases of marauding and robbery committed, by German soldiers and officers, but even encouraged these crimes and incited their men to commit wholesale looting.\n\n5. That by the commission of all these crimes the conspirators caused enormous economic damage to the people of the occupied territories, exposing them to starvation and suffering, and that they profited by their criminal activities for the personal gain and enrichment of themselves and their adherents.\n\n6. That having thus planned, prepared, and initiated wars of aggression against the freedom-loving nations, the conspirators aimed at the predatory despoliation of these nations and thereafter achieved these criminal ends by means of equally criminal and predatory methods.\n\nOn the strength of the above, the defendants have consciously and deliberately violated Article 50 of the Hague Convention of 1907, the laws and customs of war, the general principles of criminal law accepted by the penal codes of all civilized nations, as well as the national law of those countries in which these crimes were committed.\n\nFor these criminal acts, Your Honors, each and all of which are covered by Article 6(b) of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, all the defendants must be found guilty; all of them without exception must be held responsible both individually and as members of the conspiracy.\n\nMay it please Your Honors, the documents which I have presented to the Tribunal and which I have read into the record are silent witnesses to the crimes organized and committed by the defendants.\n\nBut the conscience of the Judges will hear the testimony of these silent witnesses, who relate truthfully the story of the arbitrary practices and crimes of the Hitlerite brigands and the boundless sufferings of their innumerable victims.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.\n\n[The Tribunal adjourned until 21 February 1946 at 1000 hours.]\n\nMorning Session\n\nMARSHAL: The Defendant Hess will be absent from todayâs session on account of illness.\n\nGEN. RUDENKO: I would like to inform Your Honor that in accordance with the plan of the Soviet Prosecution presented to the Tribunal and with the permission of the Tribunal, we shall start presenting evidence on that section entitled, âThe Destruction and Plunder of Cultural and Scientific Treasures, Cultural Institutions, Monasteries, Churches, and Other Religious Institutions, as well as the Destruction of Cities and Villages.â\n\nThe evidence on this section will be presented by State Counsellor of Justice of the Second Class, Raginsky.\n\nSTATE COUNSELLOR OF JUSTICE OF THE SECOND CLASS M. Y. RAGINSKY (Assistant Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.): May it please Your Honors, among the numerous and grievous war crimes committed by the Hitlerite conspiratorsâcrimes enumerated in detail in Count Three of the Indictmentâcrimes against culture occupy a definite place of their own. These crimes expressed all the abomination and vandalism of German fascism.\n\nThe Hitlerite conspirators considered culture of the mind and of humanity as an obstacle to the fulfillment of their monstrous designs against mankind, and they removed this obstacle with their own typical cruelty. In working out their insane plans for world domination, the Hitlerite conspirators, side by side with the initiation and prosecution of predatory wars, prepared a campaign against world culture. They dreamed of turning Europe back to the days of her domination by the Huns and Teutons. They tried to set mankind back.\n\nIt is unnecessary to quote the numerous pronouncements of the fascist ringleaders on this subject. I shall permit myself merely to refer to one pronouncement of Hitlerâs quoted on Page 80 of Rauschningâs book, and already presented to the Tribunal by the Soviet Prosecution. âWe,â said Hitler, âare barbarians and we wish to be barbarians. It is an honorable calling.â\n\nOn behalf of the Soviet Prosecution, I shall present to the Tribunal evidence of how the defendants put into practice these orders of Hitler, which found concrete expression in the wrecking of cultural institutions, the looting and destruction of cultural treasures, and the suffocation of the national cultural life of the peoples in the territories temporarily occupied by the German armies, that is, the territories of the U.S.S.R., Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.\n\nI shall present to the Tribunal evidence of the Hitleritesâ preparations and planning for the looting of cultural treasures; how, long before the treacherous attack on the U.S.S.R., the so-called Einsatzstab Rosenberg prepared for pillage, how the predatory activity of the Defendant Rosenberg was co-ordinated with GÃ¶ring, Heydrich, and the Supreme Command, and how this pillage was disguised.\n\nIt is now generally known to what monstrous lies and provocations the Hitlerites resorted in the camouflaging of their crimes. While annihilating millions of people in the extermination camps they had set up, they spoke, in their orders, of âfiltrationâ and âcleansing.â While destroying and plundering cultural treasures, the fascist vandals sought shelter behind the terms âcollection of materialsâ and the âstudy of problems,â and shamelessly referred to themselves as âbearers of culture.â\n\nThe Hitlerite conspirators endeavored to change into serfs, bereft of all their rights, the peoples of the territories seized; and, for this purpose, they destroyed the national culture of these peoples.\n\nThe destruction of the national culture of the Slav peoples and particularly of the Russian, Ukrainian, and Bielorussian cultures, the destruction of national monuments, schools, literature, and the compulsory Germanization of the population, followed the German occupation everywhere, in obedience to the same criminal principle which governed the ensuing pillage, rape, arson, and mass murders.\n\nI omit, Mr. President, the end of Page 3 and Page 4 of my presentation, and I proceed to the presentation of Section 2, Page 5.\n\nAs I have already indicated, the destruction of the national culture of the peoples in the occupied territories was a fundamental part of the general plan for world domination established by Hitlerâs conspirators. It is difficult to determine whether destruction or plunder was the prevalent factor in these plans. But there is no disputing the fact that both plunder and destruction were aimed at one goal onlyâextermination; and this extermination was carried out everywhere, in all the territories occupied by the Germans, and on an enormous scale.\n\nArticle 56 of the 1907 Hague Convention laid down, I quote:\n\nThe Hitlerites consciously and systematically scoffed at the principles and demands laid down in Article 56. All the conspirators are guilty of this, and the Defendant Rosenberg in the first place.\n\nRosenberg had an organization with widespread ramifications for the plunder of cultural treasures and with numerous staffs and representatives. The Einsatzstab Rosenberg and Rosenbergâs chief of staff, Utikal, were the central point of the network co-ordinating the criminal activities of many predatory organizations inspired and directed by the Hitlerite Government together with the German Supreme Command. Rosenberg was officially placed in charge of plundering the cultural treasures in the occupied territories by a decree of Hitler of 1 March 1942.\n\nI have in mind Document Number 149-PS presented to the Tribunal on 18 December of last year by the United States Prosecution and accepted by the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USA-369. With your permission, Mr. President, I shall quote only two paragraphs of this document. You will find this document on Page 3 of your document book. I quote:\n\nI omit one paragraph and quote the last paragraph of this document:\n\nThis decree of Hitlerâs was issued, as is clear from the document quoted, to all departments of the Armed Forces, the Party, and the Government.\n\nBut it is not 1 March 1942 which should be considered as the beginning of Rosenbergâs predatory activities. I shall submit several excerpts from a letter of Rosenberg to Reichsleiter Bormann in confirmation. The letter is dated 23 April 1941. This document was presented to the Tribunal on 18 December 1945 by the United States Prosecution, and it was accepted by the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USA-371 (Document Number 071-PS).\n\nThis documentâwhich Your Honors will find on Page 4 of your document bookâis interesting also for the fact that the plunder, referred to as âconfiscationâ in the letter, was carried out by the Defendant Rosenberg in close collaboration and contact, based on a written agreement, between the departments of Rosenberg and Himmler. I cite extracts from Page 1 of the Russian translation of this letter:\n\nAnd furtherâyou will find this on Page 5 in your document book:\n\nThe importance attached by the Hitlerite conspirators to Rosenbergâs predatory staffs is shown in GÃ¶ringâs special circular of 1 May 1941, addressed to all Party, Government, and military institutions, which had been ordered to co-operate with the Einsatzstab Rosenberg. This document was presented by our American colleagues on 18 December of last year and accepted by the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USA-384 (Document Number 1117-PS).\n\nEven at that time the scale on which the pillage was conducted was already enormous. As Rosenberg stated in his letter of 23 April 1941, at that time, that is, in April 1941, 7,000 cases of looted works of art had already been dispatched to Germany.\n\nTo conclude with this document I shall, with your permission, read one further brief quotation into the record. It consists of one paragraph only. You will find this paragraph on Page 6 of the document book:\n\nThis document, in which pillage is referred to as âwork,â proves that Rosenbergâs criminal activities were carried out in close contact with the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces; and, finally, that as early as April 1941 plans were being made for plundering the territories about to be occupied.\n\nThe speech of the Chief Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R., General Rudenko, and the speech of the representative of the United States Prosecution, Mr. Alderman, defined what Rosenberg meant in his letter by âterritories about to be occupiedâ at that time. That was the period of the practical realization of the evil Hitlerite schemes, planned in the so-called Plan Barbarossa, the period when the German fascist hordes were hurled against the frontiers of the Soviet Union, the period of the attack on the U.S.S.R.\n\nLastly, it is necessary to point out that, in April 1941, the Defendant Rosenberg placed Utikal at the head of all operational staffs, âthe creation of which may become necessary during the course of this war.â In this connection Rosenberg referred to the âsuccessful workâ and to the âexperience gainedâ by his operational staff in the western occupied territories and in the Netherlands.\n\nThis fact is confirmed by a certificate issued to Utikal, dated 1 April 1941, and signed by Rosenberg. The authenticity of this documentâwhich bears Document Number 143-PSâwas confirmed by Rosenberg at his interrogation on 26 September 1945. I present this document to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-371.\n\nIn reporting on the organization for the looting and destruction of cultural treasures, it is necessary to indicate yet another department which combined diplomacy with pillage. I have in mind the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe Chief Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R., General Rudenko, in his opening speech pointed out that the general pillage in the occupied regions of the U.S.S.R., carried out on the direct orders of the German Government, was directed not only by the Defendants GÃ¶ring and Rosenberg and by the various âstaffsâ and âcommandsâ subordinated to them; the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, headed by the Defendant Ribbentrop, also participated through a âspecial formation.â\n\nThe creation of such a formationâthe so-called âRibbentrop Battalionââand its practical activities in the looting of cultural treasures in the territory of the U.S.S.R. are testified to in a written statement of 10 November 1942 by ObersturmfÃ¼hrer Dr. FÃ¶rster, who was captured by Red Army units in the region of Mosdok. In this statement FÃ¶rster likewise indicated the task of Rosenbergâs staff in the plunder or, as he expressed it, in the âwithdrawalâ of museum treasures and antiques. A certified photostat of this statement I present to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-157 (Document Number USSR-157).\n\nIt is stated in FÃ¶rsterâs statement, I read:\n\nI omit the last paragraph of this statement.\n\nWith your permission, Your Honors, I shall read two more excerpts into the record from a letter of the Reich Minister for the Occupied Territories, dated 7 April 1942, and signed by order of the Minister, by Laibrandt, closest assistant of the Defendant Rosenberg. This letter, Your Honors, is in your document book, on Pages 12 and 13, and was submitted on 18 December last year by the United States Prosecution as Exhibit Number USSR-408 (Document Number USSR-408).\n\nThis document is very revealing in that it indicates the scale of the projected pillage and disguises this pillage which, in the document, is shamelessly referred to as âthe preservation of objects of culture, research material, and of scientific institutions in the Occupied Eastern Territories.â\n\nThis document is also characteristic in that Rosenberg, fearing that he might miss some of the booty, established his own monopoly to plunder and only made concessions to the quartermaster general of the Army, in conjunction with whomâas the letter revealsâOperational Staff Rosenberg carried on its âwork.â\n\nI read the first excerpt of this letter. I quote:\n\nAs you see, Your Honors, the looting of libraries, archives, scientific research institutes, museumsâboth public and privateâand even of church treasures, was already being planned.\n\nThe fact that this is not a question of preserving cultural treasures, but of plunder, is revealed by the following excerpt from the letter mentioned. You will find it on Page 12 of your document book. I quote:\n\nI shall not burden you by enumerating the many addresses to whom copies of this letter were sent. I shall merely name some of them: OKH, the Reich Minister of Economics, the Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan, the Reich Commissioners for the Baltic regions, the Ukraine, et cetera. Thus this document reconfirms that both GÃ¶ring and Funk, as well as the representatives of the OKH, actively participated in this pillage.\n\nThe priceless works of art plundered in the occupied countries were removed to Germany, now transformed by the Hitlerites into a robberâs den.\n\nThe Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union established that, in January 1943, the Commander of the 1st Tank Army, Cavalry General Mackensen, in the presence of the head of the propaganda department of the 1st Tank Army, MÃ¼ller, removed from the Rostov Museum of Pictorial and Plastic Art, which had been evacuated to the town of Piatigorsk and which was then on the premises of the Lermontov Museum, the most valuable canvases of Ribera, Rubens, Murillo, Jordaens, Vereshtshagin, Korovine, Kramskoy, Polenov, Repin, Lagorio, Aivasovsky, and Shishkin, sculptures by Donatello, and other exhibits.\n\nThis statement, Your Honors, has already been presented to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-37 (Document Number USSR-37). With your permission I should like to read into the record only one paragraph on Page 5 of this document. The quotation is on Page 18 of your document book. I quote:\n\nFrom the affidavit of the Plenipotentiary of the Polish Government, Stefan Kurovsky, it has been established that the Defendant Frank, in looting the cultural treasures of the Polish State, was also striving after his own personal gain. Pictures, porcelain, and other works of art from the plundered museums of Warsaw and KrakÃ³w, particularly from Vavel Castle, were transferred to the estate of the Defendant Frank.\n\nThe affidavit to which I referred is an appendix to the report of the Polish Government and is presented to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-302 (Document Number USSR-302). This document, Your Honors, is to be found on Pages 19-20 of your document book.\n\nIn this document registered under Document Number 055-PS, which is a letter from the head of the Political Leadership Group P4 of the Reich Ministry for the Eastern Occupied Territories, dated 14 September 1944, there are indications as to where the looted treasures were taken and stored. This letter, addressed to the âReich Minister through the Chief of the Political Leadership Staffâ is headed, âObjects of Art Evacuated from the Ukraine.â This letter is to be found in your document book on Page 21. I present this letter as documentary evidence and, submit it as Exhibit Number USSR-372 and I quote the text. I read:\n\nI read further from the text of this letter:\n\nI omit the last paragraph of this letter since it has no material bearing on the subject, and will continue by quoting an excerpt from Page 2 of Rosenbergâs letter, of which I have already read one quotation earlier in the day. You will, Your Honors, find it on Page 5 of the document book. I quote. Rosenberg wrote:\n\nYou have heard, Your Honors, of Hitlerâs attitude towards the property of the people and the works of art in the countries seized by the Germans.\n\nThis episode is to be found in the Czechoslovakian Government report, presented to the Tribunal; excerpts from this report were read yesterday into the record. Therefore, I consider there is no necessity for reading it into the record once more. However, it is necessary to note that not only Hitler but GÃ¶ring was an ardent adherent of this policy of âacquisitions.â You also heard, Your Honors, yesterday how GÃ¶ring acquired valuable Gobelin tapestries in France. However, GÃ¶ring did not acquire Gobelin tapestries only. He wrote in one of his letters to RosenbergâI refer to Document Number 1985-PS, which I submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-373, and which is in your document book on Pages 156 to 158âGÃ¶ring wrote that he âby means of purchases, presents, bequests, and barter owns perhaps the most important private collection, at least in Germany, if not in Europe.â The document presented is a copy of a typewritten letter and includes a series of corrections and notes in ink, evidently in GÃ¶ringâs own hand. This copy was captured, together with GÃ¶ringâs other correspondence, by units of the American Army, a fact which was confirmed and in due time presented to the Tribunal by our American colleagues.\n\nThis document, Your Honors, reveals, to a remarkable extent, the nature of the âacquisitionsâ effected by GÃ¶ring and also confirms Ribbentropâs part in the âpreservationâ of cultural treasures in the occupied territories. For this reason, I shall, with your permission, read a few extracts from this document.\n\nI read the extract from the first page of this letter. I quote:\n\nI now read an extract from Page 2 of the letter, the last paragraph:\n\nI omit one paragraph and I read Subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the next one. Subparagraph 2 enumerates the objects which GÃ¶ring would like to acquire. It refers to a very extensive and highly valued collection of Dutch artists of the 17th century, while Subparagraph 3 mentions âa comparatively small though very good collection of French artists from the 18th century, and finally, a collection of Italian masters.â\n\nYou have heard, Your Honors, what was meant, in practice, by âthe personal material interest of soldiers in the war.â All this established irrevocably that the Hitlerites engaged in pillage and brigandage and that everybody, from the privates to the criminal leaders of Hitlerite Germany, participated in the plunder. The same must be said regarding the destruction of cultural treasures. Decrees and directives concerning the destruction of cultural treasures came from the leaders of Hitlerite Germany and from the highest ranks of the Military Command.\n\nI shall refer, as evidence, to the order of the Commander of the German 6th Army, signed by Field Marshal Von Reichenau, approved by Hitler and entitled, âOn the Behavior of the Troops in the East.â This order was presented to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-12. This document, contrary to the usual Hitlerite custom, contains direct and entirely undisguised instructions for the destruction and suppression of culture in the occupied territories.\n\nWith your permission, I shall quote just one paragraph of this order. It is on Page 161 of your document book. I quote:\n\nAll the rest to be destroyed; no historical or artistic buildings in the East to be of any value whatsoever.\n\nI shall quote one more document which establishes that the destruction and pillage of cultural treasures, universally carried out by the Hitlerites in the territories occupied by them, was inspired and directed by the Hitlerite Government. I refer to the diary of the Defendant Frank, extracts of which have already been submitted to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-223. In the first volume of Frankâs diary, on Page 38âPage 169 in your document bookâthere appears an entry dated 4 October 1939 which reads as follows:\n\nI consider that the documents, now submitted and read into the record, are fully sufficient to enable us to draw the following conclusions:\n\n(a) The pillage and destruction of the cultural treasures of the peoples in the German occupied territories were carried out in accordance with previously elaborated and carefully prepared plans.\n\n(b) The fascist Government and German High Command directed the pillage and destruction of cultural treasures.\n\n(c) The most active role in the organization of the pillage and destruction of cultural treasures was taken by the participants in the conspiracy, the Defendants Rosenberg, Ribbentrop, Frank, and GÃ¶ring.\n\nI pass on to the next section of my presentation, entitled, âDestruction and Pillage of Cultural Treasures in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.â\n\nI reported to the Tribunal on the general plans of the Hitlerite conspirators for strangling national cultural life in the countries occupied by them. I now pass on to report on the actual materialization of the criminal plans of the Hitlerite conspirators in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.\n\nI shall refer only to such irrefutable proofs as the official reports of the Governments of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, already submitted to the Tribunal by the Soviet Prosecution. I shall read into the record a few parts of the relevant sections of these reports directly concerning the theme expounded by me, which have not been quoted by my colleagues.\n\nI begin by quoting extracts from the Czechoslovak Government reports. These excerpts, Your Honors, are to be found in your document book, on Pages 81 to 88. I quote from Page 81:\n\nThe Germans seized all colleges and hostels for students.\n\nI pass to a quotation on Page 83 of the report:\n\nI pass on to the excerpts on Page 86 of the Czechoslovakian report:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is a good opportunity to adjourn.\n\n[A recess was taken.]\n\nThus the Hitlerites destroyed the national culture of the peoples of Czechoslovakia, plundered and pillaged works of art, literature, and science.\n\nIn Poland, as in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, the German fascist invaders carried out a large-scale liquidation of national culture with exceptional cruelty. The Hitlerite conspirators destroyed the Polish intelligentsia, closed educational establishments, prohibited the publication of Polish books, looted works of art, blew up and burned national monuments.\n\nI am reading into the record relevant extracts from the Polish Government report, which was submitted to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-93 (Document Number USSR-93). These excerpts, Your Honors, are on Pages 197-200 of the document book:\n\nI skip the last paragraph and pass on to the next page:\n\nThe excerpts are on Pages 207 and 208 of the document book.\n\nI skip a few paragraphs and pass on to the last paragraph on Page 221:\n\nNational monuments:\n\nTo the report of the Polish Government is attached a list of public libraries, museums, books and other collections sacrificed to plunder and looting. These lists of objects are available on Pages 254 and 255 of the document book. In the first list we find the names of 30 libraries and in the second 21 museums and collections of works of art which were plundered and destroyed. I shall not read these lists in full, but shall mention only some of the museums and collections which were a subject of national pride and constituted the treasure of the Polish State.\n\nThe following objects became the booty of the fascist vandals: The treasure house of the Wawelski Cathedral in KrakÃ³w, the Potocki Collection in Jablonna, the Czartoryski Museum in KrakÃ³w, the National Museum in KrakÃ³w, the Museum of Religious Art in Warsaw, the State Numismatic Collections in Warsaw, the Palace of King Stanislaw-August in the Lazienkowski Park, the Palace of King Jan Sobieski in Willanow, the collection of Count Tarnowski in Sukhaya, the Religious Museum in Posen, and many others.\n\nThe Hitlerite invaders also plundered monasteries, churches, and cathedrals. On Page 43 of the report of the Polish Government, corresponding to Page 223 of the document book, there are final notes by the Polish Primate, Cardinal Hlond. They concern a written communication from Cardinal Hlond to Pope Pius XII. I shall read into the record only two paragraphs of these concluding notes. I quote:\n\nI omit the end of Page 29 and pass on to Page 30: Yugoslavia.\n\nThe destruction of the national culture of the peoples of Yugoslavia was carried out by the Hitlerites by various means and methods. I shall not, Your Honors, enumerate them in detail. These means and methods are already known.\n\nIn Yugoslavia the same thing occurred as in Poland and Czechoslovakia. We need only stress that, in the destruction of the culture of the peoples of Yugoslavia, the German fascist occupants showed great ingenuity and utilized the vast experiences acquired in other countries occupied by them. The system of destruction of the national culture of the peoples of Yugoslavia starts with attack and pillage and ends with mass murder, camps, and the ovens of the crematories.\n\nIn the report of the Jugoslav Government, presented to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-36, there are quoted a large number of facts and documents which establish, without any possibility of doubt, the criminal deeds of the defendants. But even these numerous facts quoted in the report do not exhaust all the crimes committed by the Hitlerites. The report of the Yugoslav Government quotes only typical cases as examples. I shall cite a few excerpts from this report. These excerpts, Your Honors, are on Page 303 of the document book. I quote:\n\nAnd further, on Page 307:\n\nThe German barbarians destroyed and plundered not only schools and libraries, they also destroyed universities and broadcasting stations, cultural establishments, and sanatoria. On Page 23 of the report, corresponding to Page 278 of the document book, we find, for instance, the following facts concerning Belgrade. I quote:\n\nAs is established by the report of the Jugoslav State Commission, which is Document Number J-39(a), and which I submit under Exhibit Number 364, Page 313(a) of our document bookâthe Hitlerites razed to the ground the National Library in Belgrade and burned hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, which constituted the basic stock of Serbian culture. They completely destroyed 71 and partially destroyed 41 scientific institutes and laboratories of Belgrade University. They razed to the ground the State Academy of Art, and they burned and looted thousands of schools.\n\nI omit the end of Page 31 and pass on to Page 32. Your Honors will find this passage on Page 303 of the document book.\n\nDuring the 4 years of German domination, the people of Yugoslavia experienced great sufferings and sorrow. The Germans looted the economic wealth of the country and caused great material damage. But the damage they caused to the culture of the people of Yugoslavia was even greater.\n\nIn concluding this chapter of my report, I consider it essential, Your Honors, to quote yet another excerpt from the diary of the Defendant Frank. I have in mind the calico-bound volume of the diary entitled, âConferences of the Leaders of Departments of 1939-1940,â which contains an entry regarding the conference of the departmental leaders of 19 January 1940 in KrakÃ³w. This excerpt is on Page 169 of the document book. I read:\n\nTo this statement of Frankâs, we need only add that the Defendant Frank zealously performed this task in Poland and that the Reich, Gau, and other leaders acted with equal zeal in the occupied territories of the U.S.S.R., Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.\n\nI am now going to present, Your Honors, proof of crimes committed by the defendants against the culture of the peoples of the Soviet Union.\n\nWe have heard in this court what brutality was used and on how vast a scale the Hitlerites conducted the destruction and spoliation of the cultural wealth of the peoples of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia. The crimes perpetrated by the Hitlerite conspirators in the occupied territories of the U.S.S.R. were graver still. The criminal organization, known as the Hitler Government, aimed not only at plundering the people of the Soviet Union, at destroying their towns and villages, and at extirpating the culture of the peoples of the U.S.S.R., but also at enslaving the people of the Soviet Union and of transforming our native country into a fascist colony of serfs.\n\nIn the second part of my statement I have proved how the destruction of the cultural monuments of the peoples of the U.S.S.R. was planned and perpetrated.\n\nIn the note of the Peopleâs Commissar for Foreign Affairs V. M. Molotov, dated 27 April 1942, which was presented to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number USSR-51(3) (Document Number USSR-51(3)), documents and facts are quoted which establish beyond dispute that the destruction of historic and cultural monuments and the vile mockery of national feelings, beliefs, and convictions constituted a part of the monstrous plan evolved and put into practice by the Hitlerite Government, which strove to liquidate the national culture of the peoples of the U.S.S.R. Later I shall refer again to this document, but at present I wish, with your permission, to read into the record the following excerpt which is on Page 321 of your document book. I omit the first and quote the second paragraph:\n\nTrue to their custom of destroying universally recognized cultural valuables, the Hitlerites everywhere on the Soviet territory occupied by them, devastated and mostly burned libraries, from the small club and school libraries up to and including the most valuable collections of manuscripts and books, containing unique bibliographical valuables.\n\nI omit a paragraph and continue the quotation:\n\nI omit two paragraphs and pass on to the last paragraph of this quotation:\n\nThe German vandals treated with particular hatred these cultural monuments which were most dear to the Soviet people. I shall quote several instances:\n\nThe Hitlerites plundered Yasnaya Polyana, where one of the greatest writers, Leo Tolstoy, was born, lived, and worked.\n\nThey plundered and despoiled the house where the great Russian composer, Tschaikovsky, lived and worked. In this house Tschaikovsky created the world-famous operas Eugen Onegin and The Queen of Spades.\n\nIn Taganrog they destroyed the house where the great Russian writer Chekhov lived; in Tikhvin they destroyed the residence of the Russian composer Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\nAs evidence, Your Honors, I shall read into the record an excerpt from the note of Foreign Commissar Molotov, dated 6 January 1942. This document has already been submitted to the Tribunal as Document Number 51(2). This excerpt is on Page 317 of the document book. I quote:\n\nI omit the next paragraph and close this quotation.\n\nActing upon directions of the German Military Command, the Hitlerites destroyed and annihilated the cultural-historic monuments of the Russian people connected with the life and work of the great Russian poet, Alexander Sergeivitch Pushkin.\n\nThe report of the Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union, the original copy of which is now submitted to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-40 (Exhibit Number USSR-40), reads as follows:\n\nI shall omit the beginning of Page 1 of the report.\n\nI shall also omit the next paragraph. I read on:\n\nI omit the next paragraph and read on:\n\nI omit the end of this page and pass on to Page 41 of the report:\n\nI omit the rest of this page, and I pass on to Page 42:\n\nI omit a paragraph and quote further:\n\nThe destruction of works of art and architecture in the towns of Pavlovsk, Tzarskoe-Selo, and Peterhof, figure among the worst anti-cultural crimes of the Hitlerites. The magnificent monuments of art and architecture in these towns, which had been turned into âmuseum towns,â are known throughout the civilized world. These art and architectural monuments were created in the course of 2 centuries. They commemorated a whole series of outstanding events in Russian history.\n\nCelebrated Russian and foreign architects, sculptors, and artists created masterpieces which were kept in these âmuseum townsâ and, together with valuable masterpieces of Russian and foreign art, they had been blown up, burned, robbed, or destroyed by the fascist vandals.\n\nI read into the record Exhibit Number USSR-49 (Document Number USSR-49) which includes a statement of the Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union dated 3 September 1944. The excerpts which I shall quote, Your Honors, are on Pages 330-332 of the document book.\n\nI omit the end of Page 43 and the whole of Page 44 of this statement, and begin my quotation in the middle of Page 45:\n\nI skip one paragraph and quote the last one on this page:\n\nI skip one paragraph on Page 47:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has appreciated the successful efforts which the other members of the Soviet Delegation have made to shorten their addresses, and they would be glad if you could possibly summarize some of the details with which you have to deal in the matter of destruction and spoliation and perhaps omit some of the details.\n\nThat is all for this morning.\n\n[The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.]\n\nAfternoon Session\n\nMR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: The looting and destruction of historical and artistic palaces in the town of Pushkin (Tzarskoe-Selo) was carried out with malice aforesight by order of the highest German authorities.\n\nI omit the end of Page 47 and the beginning of Page 48:\n\nI omit one paragraph and continue:\n\nI omit another paragraph.\n\nI omit one more paragraph.\n\nI omit a paragraph.\n\nI omit two paragraphs:\n\nI omit the end of Page 49 and the beginning of Page 50 of the report.\n\nI omit the next two paragraphs and quote the last paragraph, which concludes this document:\n\nMany large towns were destroyed by the German fascist invaders in the occupied U.S.S.R. territories. But they destroyed with particular ruthlessness the ancient Russian cities containing monuments of ancient Russian art. I quote as an example the destruction of the cities of Novgorod, Pskov, and Smolensk. Novgorod and Pskov belong to these historical centers where the Russian people laid the foundation of their state; here, in the course of centuries flourished a highly developed and individual culture. It left a rich heritage which constitutes a valuable possession of our people. Thanks to the survival of numerous monuments of ecclesiastic and civil architecture, murals, paintings, sculpture, and handicraft, Novgorod and Pskov were rightly considered the seat of Russian history.\n\nThe Hitlerite barbarians destroyed, in Novgorod, many valuable monuments of Russian and foreign art of the 11th and 12th centuries. They not only destroyed the monuments but they reduced the entire city to a heap of ruins.\n\nBy way of proof, I shall read into the record some excerpts from the document presented to the Tribunal as Document Number USSR-50. You will, Your Honors, find these excerpts on Pages 333 and 334 of the document book. I read:\n\nI omit one paragraph.\n\nI omit one sentence.\n\nI omit the rest of this page and pass on to Page 54, of my report.\n\nCitizen Youri Nikolaievich Dimitriev, in his affidavit, gives a very detailed account of the barbarous destruction by the Germans of the monuments of ancient Russian art in the cities of Novgorod and Pskov. Dimitriev, since 1937, was the custodian of the Ancient Russian Art Section of the Russian State Museum in Leningrad. He began the study of the historical monuments of Novgorod and Pskov in 1926. As a great expert in this particular sphere of art, he was asked by the Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union to participate in the investigation of the crimes of the German fascist invaders.\n\nI submit to the Tribunal the original of Dimitrievâs depositions, duly certified, in accordance with legal procedure in the U.S.S.R., as Document Number USSR-312 (Exhibit Number USSR-312).

They desecrated and burned down ancient monuments; they destroyed schools and institutes, libraries, and sanatoriums. The report also mentions the fact that in April 1943, the Germans needed rubble to pave the roads. For this purpose, they blew up the intermediate school. The Germans burned down all the libraries of the city and 22 schools; 646,000 volumes perished in the library fires.\n\nI now pass on to Page 57 of my report:\n\nI shall quote only one last paragraph on Page 57:\n\nSuch are some of the numerous facts of the crimes committed by the fascist barbarians. They demonstrate how the criminal schemes of the Hitlerite conspirators were actually materialized.\n\nIt is known how mercilessly the German fascist invaders carried out the economic plunder of the Ukrainian"
