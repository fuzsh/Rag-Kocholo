Japan's deficiencies in mineral resources were of little importance in an era when cheap raw materi- als could be acquired easily from overseas. The United States offered a ready market for manufactured exports, made more competitive by an increasingly undervalued cur- rency. It also provided access to industrial expertise for Japanese technologists. Foreign policy focused overwhelm- ingly on trade promotion, although one important territorial issue was resolved with the return of Okinawa to Japanese sovereignty by the United States in 1972. The \\\"family state\\\" of pre-war times was replaced by a \\\"developmental state\\\", in which a stable political regime under the conservative Liberal Democrats allowed major industrial groupings to re-emerge under the guiding hand of an elite bureaucracy.

Japanese agriculture itself was by now heavily subsi- dized and plagued by inefficiencies linked to the small farms inherited from the land reforms of the 1940s. It attempted, unsuccessfully, to adapt to competition from imports by changing the crops that it produced. The Plaza Agreement of 1985, between the United States, Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, sought to resolve global trade imbalances by expanding Japan's domestic demand. The rapid appreciation of the yen was also expected to make Japanese products less compet- itive in international markets and to boost imports to Japan. Yet again, however, Japanese industry responded by shift- ing up a gear: in a flurry of direct investment in East and Southeast Asia, manufacturers sought to avoid high Japanese wages by moving production overseas (map 3). This process was known as \\\"hollowing out\\\". It was matched by a rapid expansion in Japan's foreign aid, the aim of which was to support infrastructural improvements in neighbouring countries. This facilitated production of, and created additional demand for, Japanese products in these countries. Japan became the centre of a regional manufac- turing system tied together by trade flows of raw materials, components and manufactured goods. Tokyo was trans- formed into one of the world's three great financial centres. Investments at home and overseas were buoyed up by low interest rates and the willingness of banks to lend against property assets, which soared in value. This speculative \\\"bubble economy\\\" finally burst in the early 1990s as land prices collapsed, obliging the government to shore up the ailing banking sector. The banks' problems were com- pounded by the subsequent economic crisis in Southeast Asia (pages 250-51) as loans to finance new factories in Thailand, Indonesia and elsewhere turned sour. THE WARIN ASIA 1931-45 pages 234-35 253\n\nTHE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SINCE 1949 A China's population almost doubled during the period of Mao's leadership (1949-76), although the period of the Great Leap Forward (1958-62), which caused severefamine in some areas, shows up as a slight slowing of the growth rate. Attempts were made during the 1970s to restrict the size of families, culminating in a law passed in 1979 (generally considered to have failed) limiting married couples to one child. As in many other developing countries, a falling death rate has ensured that, despite a reducedbirth rate, the population continues to grow - officially at around 1 per cent per year, although this takes no account of a large, mobile, unregistered population, mainly to be found in rural China. The country's urban population has grown steadily as a proportion of the total, exceptfor the period of the Cultural Revolution (1966-72), when it declined. ^ China has thelargest population of any country in the world. At the time of Mao's death in 1976 the majority were clustered, as they had been for centuries, in the rich agricultural regions, with around 20 per cent of the population in cities.

From the early 1960s, however, China's relations with the Soviet Union soured, mainly due to Khrushchev's repudia- tion of Stalin's policies. At the same time, China also lost support among the neutral, newly independent countries of the developing world when it crushed anti-Chinese opposi- tion in Tibet, and entered into a border dispute with India. The Cultural Revolution was a period of intense xenopho- bia, but in 1971 Mao, in an apparent reversal of policy, welcomed President Nixon's initiative to normalize relations with the United States. In October of that year the People's Republic of China replaced Taiwan in the United Nations and re-entered the world stage. CHINA AFTER MAO Mao's death in 1976 initiated a power struggle between the \\\"Gang of Four\\\" (which included Mao's widow) and Deng Xiaoping. Deng emerged the victor, and during his era (1978-97) pragmatism prevailed. Faced with a rapidly expanding population (map 1 and bar chart), economic growth became the stated priority, to be brought about by a policy of \\\"four modernizations\\\" (in industry, agriculture, science and technology, and the army). China's industrial output rose steadily during the 1980s, and increased dra- matically during the 1990s by over 20 per cent each year. In the agricultural sector China made important gains through the reform of farming practices. Although the total land area committed to agriculture remained much the same, yields improved enormously (map 2). From 1978 onwards state ownership and planning were reduced, \\\"the market\\\" was respected and nurtured, and property rights were gradually defined. Communes were abolished and citizens permitted to run private businesses and engage in market activities. Instead of attempting to make China self-sufficient, the new regime adopted an export-led growth strategy, copied from other newly indus- trialized countries. DEMANDS FOR DEMOCRACY As China became more open to Western economic princi- ples and ideology during the 1980s, many people, in particular students, began also to demand modernizationof the political system. Although the paramount leader Deng resisted these demands, Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang was more open to change. Hu's demo- tion and subsequent death triggered pro-democracy demonstrations in many major cities during April 1989. Throughout May demonstrators occupied the vast Tian- anmen Square in Beijing, demanding Deng's dismissal and political reform. With the world's press watching, the Chinese government held back for several weeks.However, overnight on 3-4 June the army moved in to disperse the demonstrators. Hundreds were killed and thousands were injured; arrests, imprisonments and executions followed. The international outrage that resulted soured China's rela- tions with the outside world and briefly affected foreign investment , which had, since the 1980s, been channelled through China's \\\"Special Economic Zones\\\" and \\\"open cities\\\" (map 3 and bar chart). In July 1997, shortly after Deng's death, Hong Kong was returned to Chinese rule (and designated a \\\"Special Administrative Region\\\"). Later that year the Chinese gov- ernment decided to privatize state-owned enterprises operating at a loss - roughly 30 per cent of the state sector. With mounting unemployment from the collapse of the public sector, the trend towards a semi-capitalist society continues in uneasy contrast to the strict party control, creating a great deal of uncertainty about the political and economic future of the world's most populous nation.

As a result, large parts of Africa experienced economic stagnation during the 1980s. In the early 1990s optimism replaced the euphoria of the independence era and the gloom of the 1980s, as several civil wars ended and democratic elections were held across the continent. As the decade wore on, however, such opti- mism appeared ill-founded as bitter ethnic and religious disputes and civil wars broke out and the prospect of democracy and development receded in several key states.

FAILURE OF INDUSTRIALIZATION The industrialization strategy, known as import-substitution industrialization (ISI), which had been officially endorsed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America in 1949, was deemed a failure within 15 years (pages 272-73). By the mid-1960s government-led industrialization had not only failed to generate the anticipated number of jobs, but had also not progressed much beyond light industry and proved unable to compete effectively in local or inter- national markets. This was partly the result of weaknesses within the strategy itself, which required Latin American countries to import more in the short term in order to estab- lish their industries, leading to balance of payments difficulties. Another problem was Latin America's enduring technology and communications gaps: the more developed economies produced goods that were not only of higher quality, but were also marketed with far greater sophistica- tion. The politicization of economic decision-making by Latin American states also had a detrimental effect on indus- trialization policies. Some Latin American countries did become more industrialized during the 1950s and 1960s (bar charts), but were still far more dependent on the production of raw materials (map 1) than had been antici- pated when the policy of ISI was launched. INTERNATIONAL DEBT CRISIS The failure of the industrialization model was one factor contributing to the debt crises that hit Latin America in the early 1980s. The major cause, however, was the disintegra- tion, during the 1960s, of the system of international financial regulation that had been in place since 1944. When oil price rises in 1973led to a surplus of \\\"petro- dollars\\\" on the international lending markets, Latin American countries, which had never succeeded in gener- ating internally the levels of capital needed for development, appeared to be ideal targets for loans. With economic depression and inflation in the developed economies, these loans were effectively set at very low, or even negative, interest rates. When US interest rates rose dramatically in the early 1980s, Latin American countries found themselves 258\n\nATLAS OF WORLD HISTORY: PART 5 POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS Politically, this period saw the introduction of full suffrage throughout the region, with women granted the vote by the mid-1950s in all Latin American countries, and literacy qual- ifications gradually dropped, although not until as late as 1989 in the case of Brazil. However, for much of the period the democratic process was compromised at best, and com- pletely suspended at worst. Most countries were governed by populist regimes in the 1940s and 1950s which, although elected, tended to use dictatorial methods once in power. Argentina's Juan Domingo Peron (1946-55) was the classic example. Nevertheless, populism generated a level of politi- cal activity among the masses which alarmed those in the property-owning classes to such an extent that most were prepared to support military coups in the 1960s and 1970s. Such fears were shared by US governments, whose long- standing concerns about political stability in Latin America had acquired particular urgency because of the Gold War (pages 244-45). During the late 1940s and 1950s, the United States had taken care to consolidate not only its political alliances with Latin American nations (in the Organization of American States) but also its military links, with the USA supplying most of Latin America's weapons and military training (map 2). In these circumstances, the military coups of the 1960s and 1970s ushered in regimes influenced partly by the management techniques and A In the second half of the 20th century also occasionally direct methodsin its Thevariety in ethnic composition in the A Between 1956 and 1958 Fidel Castro led the United States extended its sphere of attempts to quash what it perceived as countries of Latin America is striking.

The military leaders argued that only they were capable of bringing about national development and that the demo- cratic process would have to be suspended until the country was \\\"ready\\\" for electoral politics. The repression for which these regimes became internationally condemned was directed initially at the Left, but gradually acquired a random nature designed to inhibit all political activity, even among moderates. Although the military stayed in power for lengthy periods of time (Brazil 1964-85, Argentina 1976-83 and Chile 1973-89), they proved no more able than civilian politicians to achieve economic development; indeed, they presided over the debt crises (and, in many cases, their purchases of weapons contributed substantially to the debt). A process of redemocratization began in Latin America in 1980, and by 1990 there were elected govern- ments in every country of the region apart from Cuba. Most Latin American countries are still some distance away from being fully consolidated liberal democracies, with civilian control over the military, respect for civil rights, freedom of the press and broadly representative polit- ical parties. The process of resisting authoritarianism stimulated a wide range of grassroots organizations con- cerned with, for example, human rights, women's issues and neighbourhood self-help, many of which are reluctant to be recruited by formal political parties. The question of ethnic identities (map 3) also assumed an increasing significance, particularly in 1992, the quincentennial of the European \\\"conquest\\\", \\\"discovery\\\" or \\\"encounter\\\" with the Americas. (The very term used to describe Golumbus's landing in 1492 is highly disputed, reflecting the intractability of the ethnic and cultural issues at stake.) There is still a potentially dan- gerous gap between the concerns of the people and of the government in many Latin American countries.

Despite heavy casualties, but civil order was still a long way from being restored. Iraq failed to make territorial gains. Defeat by Israel in 1949 served as a catalyst for the emergence in Egypt, Syria and Iraq of army-led, nationalist, secular regimes that advocated socialist reforms to improve living conditions for the countries' rapidly growing populations. Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt became the champion of Arab nationalism, advocating non-alignment, with some co-operation with the Soviet Union, as a way of curtailing the influence of Western powers in the Middle East. In 1956 Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal led to a failed attempt by Israeli, British and French troops to gain control of this vital sea-route. Egypt's anti-Western approach was opposed by Saudi Arabia, Israel and Iran, who saw Egypt's growing power as a threat. The conflict was played out in a proxy war, when Egypt and Saudi Arabia supported opposing sides in the civil war in Yemen in 1962-69 (map 1). By the 1970s, most of the major industrialized countries relied on oil from the Middle East - a situation that the Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (map 1) used to their advantage when they placed an oil embargo on countries who supported Israel in its 1973 war with Egypt and Syria (pages 272-73). The tensions arising from the widening social rifts in many oil-rich states resulted in the emergence of \\\"political Islam\\\", which combined radical religious teaching of Islam with the desire for social and political change. The Iranian revolutionof 1979 under Ayatollah Khomeini, with its specifically Shi'ite character, encouraged other Islamic opposition movements. These erupted across the Middle East, from Egypt to Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, Islamic groups fought the Soviet intervention of 1979 before engaging in a civil war which resulted in the Taliban establishing a fundamentalist govern- ment in 1997. In October 2001, the United States launched air strikes against Afghanistan after the Taliban refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, based in Afghanistan and leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist network which was held responsible for the attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001 (pages 242-43). In December 2001, opposition forces, backed by US and British special forces overthrew the Taliban, and formed an interim government. WARS IN THE GULF REGION The Iranian revolution caused particular concern in neigh- bouring Iraq, which feared a similar rebellion from its own large population of Shi'ite Muslims. Both countries also included large Kurdish populations, and Iraq accused Iran of supporting an uprising of the Iraqi Kurds in 1979. The main motive for an Iraqi attack on Iran in 1980, however, was to expand into the oil-rich region on their joint border (map 4). At the end of an eight-year war in which an estimated one million people died, neither side had made significant gains. During the war, Iraq received aid from most of the Arab states and, shortly before the end of the fighting, used chemical weapons against its own Kurdish population, some of whom had supported Iran. Debts incurred by Iraq in its war against Iran, territorial claims, disputes over the price to charge for oil, and loss of prestige were all factors that contributed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. Ignoring international condemna- tion, Iraq annexed Kuwait and could not be persuaded by United Nations sanctions to withdraw. In January 1991 an international alliance led by the United States declared war on Iraq, initially concentrating on an aerial bombardment of Iraqi military installations. On 24 February, ground forces moved in, and by the end of February Iraqi troops retreated from Kuwait. Iraq's subsequent suppression of revolts by Shi'ite Muslims in the south and Kurds in the north led to UN-backed \\\"no-fly zones\\\" for Iraqi aircraft north of the 36th and south of the 32nd parallels.

Thus Yeltsin's position was strengthened, and although Gorbachev was reinstated his power was diminished. The Ukrainian independence refer- endum in December 1991 made the continuation of the Soviet Union untenable, and when Yeltsin and the presi- dents of Ukraine and Belarus met in Minsk to create the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Soviet Union collapsed into 15 independent republics (map 1).

September it was dissolved. The political leaders within the duma retaliated by proclaiming Yeltsin's removal from the presidency, with the result that in October they were besieged in the parliament building. Their response was to order an attack on the Kremlin and other key buildings, leading to a three-hour battle. The army rescued Yeltsin and shelled parliament, leaving 145 dead and over 700 injured. New elections resulted once again in a majority for the Nationalists-Communists, but Yeltsin, although in ill-health, won the presidential elections of June 1996. His reformist policies failed once again to improve the economy. A financial collapse in the summer of 1998 discredited the market reformers and brought a new conflict between Yeltsin and the duma, with the latter rejecting Yeltsin's attempt to restore Chernomyrdin as prime minister. The following year Yeltsin resigned in favour of Vladimir Putin. NATIONALIST DEMANDS Nationalism, responsible for the break-up of the Soviet Union, also threatened the Russian Federation. Autonomous republics, such as Tatarstan and Yakutia (now Sakha), demanded \\\"sovereignty\\\", in which their own laws would take precedence over those of Moscow. Yeltsin's Union Treaty of March 1992 compromised by granting them con- siderable autonomy, and finally even Tatarstan signed in February 1994. Chechenia split from Ingushetia and declared independence after the August 1991 coup. At the end of 1994, Yeltsin sent in Russian troops, which were forced to withdraw in 1997 (map 2). In 1999 a fresh Russian offensive was launched against the separatists, but it failed to end their military and terrorist campaign.

Demands were made by Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia for a large measure of sovereignty, and by 265 Serb nationalists for a larger Serb state (to include parts of Slovenia, Croatia andBosnia-Herzegovina). The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with a Serb population of 2 per cent of the total, achieved independence peaceably in 1991. The process of independence in Slovenia, which also included a Serb population of around 2 per cent, was accomplished in 1991 with only a brief intervention by the Yugoslav (Serbian) army. In Croatia, however, the conflict that broke out in 1991, following the Croatian declaration of independence, was more violent, with the Yugoslav army fighting on behalf of a Serbian minority of around 12 per cent of the total. The bloodiest conflict occurred in ethnically and reli- giously mixed Bosnia-Herzegovina,where the 1991 census showed that 31 per cent of the population were Serb, 17 per cent Croat, and 44 per cent were classified as \\\"Bosnian Muslim\\\" (although some of these were of no religious per- suasion). An organized campaign of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" was undertaken, principally by the Serbs, with the aim of creat- ing ethnically homogeneous regions in Bosnia as a prelude to its dismemberment and incorporation into Serbia and Croatia. The war, and the terrorist methods used against the civilian population, resulted in large-scale movements of populations (map 3). In Kosovo, a region in southern Serbia where the large ethnic Albanian population sought independence, violence erupted in 1998 between the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Yugoslav army.

In June 1999, following a NATO campaign of air strikes, Serbian forces withdrew as NATO troops entered Kosovo. The UN then took over the administration of the province. Significant Hungarian minorities remain in Romania and Slovakia, and the Bulgarian population is around 10 per cent Turk. There is also still a sizeable Roma population in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, although accurate figures are difficult to come by. The Roma people are subjected to a variety of forms of discrimination, and a significant increase in violent incidents arising from anti-Roma feelings since 1989 has encouraged many to attempt to emigrate to Western Europe.

UN peacekeeping operations have generally worked well where the task is fairly limited and clear cut - such as the patrolling of ceasefire lines in Cyprus - but when the situa- tion is more complex, as in Rwanda or Bosnia, the UN peacekeepers have often found themselves out of their depth. Nevertheless, peacekeeping has, in many cases, assisted in ending war and in creating the conditions in which the causes of the war can be addressed through diplo- macy, and the economic and social reconstruction of a war-torn country can commence. \\\"SECOND GENERATION\\\" PEACEKEEPING Since the end of the Gold War new opportunities have arisen for UN action in dealing with threats to peace, and this has stimulated an increase in the form of operation known as \\\"second generation\\\" peacekeeping. This occurs when the UN becomes involved in intra-state conflicts in \\\"failed states\\\", where governmental functions are sus- pended, the infrastructure is destroyed, populations are displaced and armed conflict rages. In these circumstances the UNhas performed three different peacekeeping roles. First, it has acted as a neutral force and honest broker between the warring factions, seeking to encourage the negotiation and implementation of a peace agreement and to prepare and conduct national elections as a means of fur- thering reconciliation and stability. This was the case with the United Nations Angola Verification Missions from 1989 onwards and the UNmission to Cambodia in 1991-95.

Between 1970 and 1995 the world's refugee population increased by over 900 per cent to 27 million people. This 269 was partly due to wars (map 2), but also due to people seeking refuge from poverty, persecution and economic and environmental disasters. Refugees often end up in the poorest countries, which lack money to support their own citizens, let alone refugees. These displaced populations are a growing concern to the international community. With so many nations still struggling to develop eco- nomically and politically, the provision of basic human rights on a world scale seems an immense task. A strong international legal foundation has been laid for the respect of human rights. However, the reluctance of the interna- tional community to use economic and military sanctions against governments that abuse human rights - and the ineffectual nature of these sanctions - means that world- wide transgressions of human rights are likely to continue.\n\nTHE POSITION OFWOMEN SINCE 1914 In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to grant and reproduction, leadership and decision making, family universal suffrage to women.

Although overall there has been a global trend towards improvement in the provision of secondary education for girls (map 3\\\\ this disguises the fact that within individual countries attendance at school may be affected by war or by economic difficulties. Furthermore, when assessing improvements in women's lives it is necessary to look at more than one variable. Even in countries that awarded women the vote relatively early (such as Turkey and Japan), women may still be represented in fewer than 10 per centof administrative and managerial jobs, whereas in countries that granted women the vote relatively late (such as Switzerland, Honduras and Botswana) more than 30 per cent of women are in such employment. One indication of women's status in society is the number who are political representatives, specifically those holding ministerial-level appointments. There have often been long periods between a country's enfranchisement of women and the election of the first woman to the national parliament. At the end of the 20th century there was still little female representation worldwide.
