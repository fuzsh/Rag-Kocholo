        "text": "ECONOMYNEXT – In Sri Lanka, indoctrination and hate targeting communities not considered to be the ‘core-nation’ as defined in ethno-religious terms start early in state-funded schools. From Grade One, in fact.\n\n‘Don’t call your Thaththa (father) Appachchi,’ a teacher tells 30 odd wide-eyed kids in a Sinhalese dominated class where there is only one Tamil child.\n\n\"Appachchi is Tamil. Don’t call him Thaththi. That is Sankara. We have to avoid being Sankara.’\n\nThis is told in Sinhala. How many hundreds of first-grade kids this teacher and others had indoctrinated is unknown.\n\nThe teacher then launches into a lecture about how Anagarika Dharmapala opposed ‘Sankara’ practices and how he led a revival of the Sinhalese race.\n\nIt is about the Sinhala race versus others, how it was dying, and how he revived it using Buddhism.\n\nIn the little majority kids, hatred is kindled against minorities.\n\nHistory is worse. Kids are taught that Tamils are the Chola, Dravida or Damila invaders (these terms mean entirely different things). Christians – Catholics in particular – are generally the Portuguese invaders.\n\nMinority kids are made to feel guilty and second class, presumably like black kids were made to feel in segregated societies in the West.\n\nNone of the teachings of Anagarika Dharmapala that kids are taught at government schools are about underlying Buddhist philosophy.\n\nThere is no opportunity to debate or understand that there is a distinct difference between Buddhist evangelization activities, aimed simply at converting people or helping them know the words of Lord Buddha, versus hate directed at members of other communities, which tends to have unfortunate consequences later.\n\nFast forward to 2019.\n\nA teacher at a school in Colombo, who had studied in a state school, tells a colleague. \"Don’t shop at Cargills, it is owned by Muslims.\"\n\n\"I don’t shop at Arpico. It is owned by Catholics,\" retorts her friend.\n\nTeaching Sinhalese kids Tamil will not solve the problem of years of indoctrinated hate, mixed up with an unhealthy dose of nationalist pseudo history.\n\nVijaya who deposed Kuweni and her lot (most probably some ancestor-worshipping community – note Yakshani – and replaced it presumably with Hinduism) is a hero.\n\nThere is no self-criticism or debate to question whether such acts are right or wrong or it was simply the way thing happened before European-style nation-states came into being.\n\nIn fact, Indian colonists had displaced, deposed or assimilated with native Austronesian tribal communities up to Indonesia and the Philippines (Mindanao) replacing older practices like ancestor worship with Hindu-Buddhism and later Islam.\n\nFurther away from India, some of the older practices remain intact to this day.\n\nIn Cambodia, for example, a foreign conqueror called Kaundinya or Hùntián (according to Chinese writings) is said to have married a ‘Naga’ princess and imported Indian customs and laws.\n\nHowever, there is no story of her being kicked out later – children and all – like the colonists did in Sri Lanka.\n\nNaga people were probably serpent worshipers, also said to have been in Sri Lanka. Even today, many people in Sri Lanka are against killing cobras.\n\nOnly Papua New Guinea and Australia seem to have escaped the rolling Indian juggernaut and was left for later European settlers to colonize. To call the various dynasties and empires of South Asia ‘Indian’ is also misleading. ‘India’ is a British creation of a later age.\n\nIn any case in government schools, a peculiar kind of cherry-picked Sinhala-centric inward-looking ‘history’ is taught. Whether Madrasas also teach this kind of Muslim-centric history, this columnist has no idea.\n\n‘Liberty! Liberty, give us, in order that we may suppress’\n\nWhat is sure is that none of this history can provide any context to understand the present day predicament of the country, which is basically a European style nation-state with the popular vote.\n\nSri Lanka’s entire post-feudal administration machinery, the political system, and the unitary state had been imported from the West.\n\nThere is little in Sri Lanka’s monarchical or Wedawassam history or in India for that matter, that can be a reliable guide to understand how the system should work or why it has failed, triggering death and destruction.\n\nInstead, all oppression of minorities and present-day problems are blamed on a convenient excuse of ‘divide and rule’. Post-1948 rulers, who got self-determination to run the country, disclaim all responsibility.\n\nNeither is anyone taught that this is a scene that had been played out at many other post-colonial states, the worst of which were in Eastern Europe from Romania to Hungary to Yugoslavia.\n\nIt was not only in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Rwanda and other African states that minorities were discriminated against and subject to mass-killing as soon as a majority got independence from an Empire or other foreign power.\n\nEconomist and philosopher Ludwig von Mises quotes Swedish novelist and playwright August Strindberg’s Road to Damascus to illustrate the point.\n\n\"FATHER MELCHER: At the Amsteg station, on the Gotthard line, you have probably seen a tower called Castle of Zwing-Uir; it is celebrated by Schiller in Wilhelm Tell. It stands there as a monument to the inhuman oppression which the inhabitants of Uri suffered at the hands of the German Kaiser! Lovely!\n\n\"On the Italian side of the Saint Gotthard lies the station of Bellinzona, as you know. There are many towers there, but the most remarkable is the Castel d’Uri. It is a monument to the inhuman oppression, which the Italian canton suffered at the hands of the inhabitants of Uri. Do you understand?”\n\n\"THE STRANGER: \"Liberty! Liberty, give us, in order that we may suppress.\"\n\n\"However, Strindberg did not add that the three cantons Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden under nineteenth-century liberalism peacefully cooperated with the Ticino whose people they had oppressed for almost three hundred years,\" Mises points out.\n\nMadrasas\n\nState-funded education, with centralized syllabuses, were the tools that were used to corrupt generations of kids and made them into adults who were filled with hate in newly independent nations.\n\nThis was first seen in Eastern Europe, where the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire created many new nations, long before it happened in Asia and Africa.\n\n\"Western Europe developed a system of obligatory public education. It came to Eastern Europe as an achievement of Western civilization,\" writes Mises, who watched in his lifetime nation-states in Europe turn in to minority oppression as soon as nationalists got control of the governing machinery.\n\n\"But in the linguistically mixed territories, it turned into a dreadful weapon in the hands of governments determined to change the linguistic allegiance of their subjects.\"\n\n\"The philanthropists and pedagogues of England who advocated public education did not foresee what waves of hatred and resentment would rise out of this institution.\"\n\nIn Sri Lanka today, the question of Madrasas or Islamic religious centred schools have shot to the spotlight after Easter Sunday attacks.\n\nIt must be noted that some of the bombers had education not at Madrasas, but at Western universities and also the state-funded school system.\n\nThough this columnist had not spoken to anyone who had studied at a Madrasa in Sri Lanka, it is unlikely to be a secular education, though whether the corruption of the mind is worse or less than at some state-funded schools, it is not known.\n\nWhat is clear is that wherever a secular state has been undermined, and the clergy gets the upper hand, misery, the slaughter of innocents and destruction has been the result.\n\nThe Denominational School System\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the Denominational School system was a product of the 1867 Morgan Committee, which was commissioned to look into improvements in the existing education system.\n\nAt the time the system was dominated by mainly various Christian missionaries. The British administrators wanted a non-denominational Christianity to be taught as a subject. There were also government schools, including Royal College.\n\nGovernment schools were in both local (vernacular) languages and English (with the focus varying depending on the views of the British Governor and top officials in charge) though after the Colebrooke Commission there was a push for English education, naturally viewed as ‘Imperialist’ by local commentators.\n\nIn 1965, the legislative council appointed a sub-committee to look into improvements. The Catholic Church at the time had French priests.\n\nBefore religious emancipation in Britain, Catholics (referred to as papists) had been severely discriminated against, due to the conflict between the Pope and the Anglican Church.\n\nChristopher Ernest Bonjean, a French Catholic priest who came from India, had been lobbying for some time over education matters. He was called to the commission. He had proposed that all denominations and religions be allowed to teach their religion as part of the curriculum.\n\nThe British government had agreed for each religion to be taught provided rest of the education was secular under the assisted school system, where the government gave some tax money to supplement the revenue of the schools.\n\nThe Catholic Church and Protestant Churches being well organized in education benefited from it. It was much later that Buddhist organizations were set up to build schools. By that time, Christian schools were already in places demarcated for assistance.\n\nSecular Education\n\nIn some Western nations, religion is no longer taught in schools. In Communist countries and some Western nations, ethics are taught and in others theology where students may learn about the basic principles of several religions.\n\nFrance is a country which has strong secular education, and even religious symbols are banned.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the new government went about cutting down the influence of the clergy and confiscated Church assets. But they did not favour any other religion either, leading to a secular state.\n\nSri Lanka nationalized mainly missionary schools. However, it did not lead to secularization in the way of France.\n\nMany schools were re-named after persons figuring in Hindu-Buddhist history (from present-day India), changing the original names, which were either the name of the particular missions that founded them or some names of Christian saints coming from Middle Eastern or European history.\n\nIn hindsight, it was a sign of things to come.\n\nA secular-liberal Sri Lanka would have ignored the founders as a historical relic, and got on with their lives.\n\nSchool names were brand names built over time, and there is no real need to change any of them at all except for nationalist reasons.\n\nA secular-socialist oriented Sri Lanka could have re-named them – along with those founded by Buddhist and Muslim missions – into some un-connected names such as the place name.\n\nBut the bigger problem is how history is taught, and the anti-minority majoritarianism that has crept into centralized syllabuses officially as well as unofficially.\n\nIn 2012, Turkey, which for long years was a secular state, changed the laws which helped boost so-called Imam Hatip colleges without popular discussion, going in the reverse direction.\n\nMadrasas proper were abolished in 1924 as part of reforms made by the father of modern (secular) Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\n\nDhimmi\n\nTurkey is, in fact, an excellent example of what happens when Empires break down. Unlike in Sri Lanka, there was no foreign power and ‘divide and rule’ to be blamed and distract reformers. The Allies had control of the territories only for a very short time after World War I.\n\nTurkey was the centre of the Ottoman Empire, where the ruler was Muslim. In line with many countries with Muslim rulers, minorities following other religions had second class or Dhimmi status, dating back from a so-called Pact of Umar.\n\nUnder Dhimmi, non-Muslims were given certain protections, including property, and were allowed to live and marry according to their customs. They paid a jizra tax.\n\nIn Sri Lanka under the 1979 constitution, Buddhism was given foremost status, and everyone else was relegated to virtual Dhimmi status.\n\nFrom the frequent riots since independence and how the police look the other way at times, it seems that the de facto Dhimmi status is pretty weak in Sri Lanka and there is poor protection for property and life.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire naturally ruled over many types of peoples it took in as part of its expansion. At one time the Ottoman Empire ran most of the present-day Middle East up to the Balkans in Europe as well as North Africa.\n\nArmenians were one such group.\n\nAnti-Minority Jealousy\n\nArmenians belonged to several Christian denominations. Some were holding high posts in the Ottoman Empire as they had higher levels of education. Outside of the main centre, however, Armenians were extremely poor.\n\nScience and education seem to have progressed initially in areas with Christian rulers despite attempts by the Church to snuff out science.\n\nIt is ironic that when Martin Luther reputed to have written his ‘Jews and their Lies’ in 1543 which helped fire anti-Semitism, Nicholas Copernicus also published the work saying that the Earth orbited the Sun, not the other way around.\n\nGreeks also had economic power in the Ottoman Empire and were Christian.\n\nForeign minorities who are trading communities tend to have stronger economic power.\n\nIn ancient Sri Lanka when it was a centre of regional commerce, trading communities like Romans and Greeks and apparently Christian Persians were resident in the island.\n\nBut economic prosperity is not a zero-sum game. This is not well-understood by nationalists, though Kings, Emperors and also Sultans, seems to have understood it.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Muslims are in business, just like Greeks were in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBut nationalists will also want to eliminate poor minorities not just the rich. In India for example, Hindu nationalists complain that Congress party went out of the way to help Muslims who tended to be poorer than Hindus.\n\n\"Why are Muslims complaining that they are poor,\" one nationalist told this columnist. \"They ran this country for centuries they should have done something then.\"\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire declined, minorities started to be oppressed, even with the Sultan in power, as his grip came under threat from reformist forces.\n\nThere was a movement to build a Republic and depose the monarch. They were inspired by Meiji Japan.\n\nLike in Japan and during the French revolutions there were nationalists, liberals and statists in the mix.\n\nThe liberals wanted an inclusive Ottoman Republic.\n\nNationalists wanted a republic with a ‘Turkish’ identity. Ultimately a group of nationalists called Committee of Union and Progress gained the upper hand. Liberals were sidelined, and Young Turks took control.\n\nArmenians, who served in the Army in the Ottoman Empire from the days of Sultans were removed.\n\nIn 1915 in the so-called Armenian genocide, more than 1.5 million Armenians were believed to have been killed. Hundreds of thousands fled and became stateless citizens.\n\nThey benefitted from so-called Nansen passports developed by Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian explorer who was tasked to help them by the League of Nations. He was the High Commissioner for Refugees for the League. The present-day UNHCR is a result of what he started.\n\nThe Nansen passport was developed initially to help Russians who were made stateless by Lenin. Lenin ‘revoked’ the citizenship of over 800,000 expat Russians who were made stateless as a result.\n\nIn earlier ages, citizenship was not an issue. People simply walked.\n\nIronically after Easter attacks, refugees from Pakistan who were in Sri Lanka under UNHCR protection (some of whom were Christian) were targeted by nationalists.\n\nThe massacres of Armenians and other Christians later led to the modern-day coining of the term ‘genocide’ according to some observers.\n\nTurkey aligned itself with nationalist Germany in World War I (Central Powers) and lost the war. As a result, its empire was broken up.\n\nIt lost territory, and Saudi Arabia became an independent state, after a long series of internal conflicts, combined with and British moves to de-stabilize Ottomans during the war.\n\nTurkey became a secular republic after World War I, under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The new rulers were statist but secular. The military was also secular. But all that is now changing.\n\nTurkey also had a bad central bank and is still the sick man of Europe. An unstable central bank with a collapsing currency is a trait Turkey shares with Sri Lanka.\n\nHowever, at the outer fringes of its former empire, countries like Saudi Arabia have excellent central banks which do not engage in fancy monetary policy and self-destruct.\n\nEthno-religious Nationalism\n\nEthno-religious nationalism is not really about economic power. While it is true that migrant trading communities tend to be rich, when territories with Muslims were annexed, those people are not necessarily wealthy.\n\nMuslims in present-day India were annexed by Britain in the building of the Raj.\n\nThe problem with nationalists is that they want to eliminate people who they have never seen, simply because they are on the face of the Earth speaking a particular language or following a religion that is different from their own and is making up demographic numbers.\n\nIf there is economic power, all the good to fire up jealousy.\n\nFor Hitler and his followers, the fact that there were wealthy Jews and bankers certainly helped spread resentment.\n\nBut the Romany were not rich. Nor were homosexuals. Neither were the Slavs.\n\nIt is a mistake to think that nationalism is driven by economics. It is like saying that the Tamil Tiger problem was caused by poverty.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Millions of impoverished people have been eliminated by nationalists, and many people live in poverty without resorting to terrorism against another community.\n\nAn economically prosperous community or an educated one is a useful tool.\n\nSinhalese and Tamils were exported to Malaysia by the British to build the civil service. They have built Hindu and Buddhist temples. The Sultans of Malaysia allowed it under British rule. Many African nations import Sri Lankan accountants even now.\n\nAn economically prosperous person, of whatever community pays tax. Unless he is protected by import duties and is, therefore, exploiting the consumer, he is serving the people.\n\nWhen Zimbabwe expropriated and drove out white farmers leading to a collapse in agricultural output neighbouring nations gave them land leases and bank credit, becoming net exporters of maize or tobacco or whatever they grew.\n\nWhen Sri Lanka expropriated British tea farmers, Kenya let them come.\n\nIrredenta and Triangular Nationalism\n\nMost nationalists only want to create a homogenous nation-state within their country.\n\nRogers Brubaker, a US academic, has identified the following elements in a newly independent, nationalist leaning, nation-state.\n\nThe nationalists, which constitutes a majority, defines a ‘core nation’ as belonging to them. This could be Sinhalese, Buddhist, or Turkish or Muslim, German or Italian, or Jewish in the case of Israel.\n\nHowever, it does not represent the actual citizenry since in the present day, as a country’s demography is always in a state of flux. Birth rates may wax and wane. People may change their language or religion, migrants may come and go. If the country was recently part of an Empire or under the control of a larger neighbouring nation, border are open.\n\nSri Lanka after independence brought in a tight citizenship law to freeze the population and expel Indian origin workers ending thousands of years of migration for various tasks, ranging from toddy tapping to catching elephants.\n\nThe lack of homogeneity and the state of flux triggers the idea that the core-nation is not flourishing, and state interventions are needed to fix it. Language or religion policies (anti-conversion laws), citizenship, and so on are then instituted.\n\nUnlike capitalism, where transactions are voluntary, state intervention is coercive and are usually zero-sum leaving victims in their wake.\n\nIt is usually the case that wherever there is a minority, there is also a similar majority community living in the next country. This may be because people migrated during imperial or foreign rule, or that former feudal or imperial rulers drew the borders in across the land of a linguistic or religious group – as they have done for millennia – or the border was simply where the last war stopped.\n\nWhen a majority discriminates against the ‘alien’ minority in the newly independent nation-state, the same ethnic group in the next country will then try to help the minority or irredenta – the unredeemed people.\n\nThe irredenta will insist that they have been living the land for centuries or millennia and is their homeland too and not just that of the majority, leading to a triangular power struggle or triangular nationalism.\n\nThat is why some people in Tamil Nadu helped the Tamil Tigers. They may not have any idea aim to annex Sri Lanka’s North, and indeed, the Northern people may not want to be annexed, but simply want self-determination.\n\nEither way, the ground is set for killing and bloodshed.\n\nPan-Nationalism\n\nPan-Nationalism is a connected concept. Hitler wanted to create Greater or Pan Germany, which will annex countries where German speakers lived, the Third Reich.\n\nThis was supposedly the re-creation of glorious past (atheether sri vibhuoothiya in Sinhalese nationalism), where such a Greater Germany existed, such as the Holy Roman Empire or the German Empire unified by Bismark.\n\nBut the Second Reich was not homogeneous either. The Jews and other minorities also existed then.\n\nHitler annexed Austria, where Germans were a majority, to build a Pan-German state, and other countries where Germans were a minority. Russian Tsars – before communism – had also been trying to build a Pan-Slavic state.\n\nThe excuse to annex a country with a minority could be the oppressed irredenta.\n\nUnlike a standard or successful Emperor, who wanted the land and people and their knowledge, the Nazis and other nationalist just want the land, not the people, a concept called Lebensraum.\n\nThis is the difference between ordinary colonial rule and Pan-Nationalism.\n\nEastern European philosophers had complained that the British never understood the nature of nationalism (Britain itself was a constitutional monarchy, where the king was ‘German’ and Scotland or Ireland could vote itself out if they wanted to, leaving aside the question of the Empire which was progressively let go and internal elections held), as it was a free trading – basically federal state – and as a result could not comprehend the plan to eliminate Jews and Slavs.\n\nHitler and his cohorts used to a concept of Aryanism made popular by the Thule Society and Helena Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society to include ‘superior’ people and exclude others.\n\nAccordingly the British were Aryan. So were the Norwegian or the French.\n\nIt gets funnier, except that it is no joke. For South Asian nationalists, Tamils were Dravidian and not ‘Aryan’.\n\nHitler also wanted to eliminate Slavs their land was to be taken as part of expanding Germay into the East under General Plan East. They were also not ‘Aryans’.\n\nGeneralplanOst (Europe, with pre-war borders, showing the extension of the Generalplan Ost master plan of Hitler. LEGEND: Dark grey – Germany (Deutsches Reich). Dotted black line – the extension of a detailed plan of the \"second phase of settlement\" (zweite Siedlungsphase). Light grey – planned territorial scope of the Reichskommissariat administrative units; their names in blue are Ostland (1941-1945), Ukraine (1941-1944), Moskowien (never realized), and Kaukasien (never realized). Source: Wikimedia\n\nThe entire Soviet Union was to be taken under Generalplan Ost, and the Slavs massacred on enslaved. About 27 million Soviet people, including nearly nine million soldiers, died during World War II.\n\nIn many countries, there were Nazi ‘fifth columns’ to welcome them and carry out sabotage before they came.\n\nEven the US had a pro-Nazi fifth column especially in the Republican Party who opposed America joining World War II.\n\nIslamic Pan-Nationalism\n\nIslamic State is not new global terrorism as Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed. But merely an old concept coming back in religious garb.\n\nWhat is called global terrorism is basically a network of fifth columns in countries to be included in the ‘Reich.’\n\nThe ISIS took control of a large swathe of Syria, which along with Iraq was previously ruled by the Baath Party, a secular – left-oriented (hence the link with the Soviet Union) political movement.\n\nThe ISIS wanted to create a Pan-Islamic state running up to Sri Lanka and the North African territories that had once been with various Muslim leaders including Ottomans.\n\nHowever now that ISIS had lost their core state in Syria and Iraq from which they hoped to expand the Pan-Islamic state.\n\nA suspected ISIS’s Pan-Islamic state included countries that were controlled by Muslim rulers in the past as well as those that were not. This map is from the Empire of Fear: Inside the Islamic State by Andrew Hosken.\n\nIt was not necessary for an oppressed minority to exist for ISIS to extend its tentacles, though it can certainly help gain recruits. With repeated anti-Muslim riots, Sri Lanka was undoubtedly an easy candidate.\n\nBut ISIS and Al Qaeda are, or were, active in many majority Muslim states, where there is no oppression of Muslims at all.\n\nThey are more active in secular states with a Muslim majority, where they feel Islam is not adequately respected.\n\nThis is where Wahabism comes in.\n\nWahabism\n\nSaudi Arabia and Al Saud dynasty originated in the outer reaches of the Ottoman Empire, partly helped by Western powers like Britain after World War I.\n\nHowever, the alliance between Muhammed ibn Saud and Muhammed ibn Abd-al-Wahhab dates back to 1744. It is a remarkable tale of triumph and defeat and comeback.\n\nUnder instruction from Wahabis, Al Saud’s decided to run a tightly Muslim state, which was unlike earlier and larger Muslim ruled empires, which were more cosmopolitan. Gaining control of Mecca and Medina after expanding out of his original stronghold of Nadj, helped increase the legitimacy of the Saud dynasty.\n\nThe collapse of the Bretton Woods and the inflationary rise in oil prices made Saudi Arabia more powerful.\n\nUnlike Iran, which had a bad central bank which printed money and de-stabilized the country, Saudi Arabia had a good one, helping generate an economy at least as stable as the US, despite sea-sawing oil prices and deficit spending at times.\n\nHelped by oil money, Wahabism spread.\n\nMilitancy increased after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and the US and Saudi Arabia funded partisans inside the country. With Wahabi zeal, its citizens also went to fight.\n\nIt seems that the more modern Saudi Royals are becoming slightly uneasy with Wahabism. Wahabi driven militants are thinking on their own and operating on their own agenda.\n\nSaudi Arabia has already closed its religious police.\n\nThowheed Movement\n\nA characteristic of many religions that originated in the Middle East, including Zoroastrianism, Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions, is the concept of one god or monotheism.\n\nMonotheism itself rejects the concept of any other god. Obviously, such a religion could be more susceptible to nationalism than other faiths, and its priests or activists will find it easier to push the idea of discrimination or intolerance to their followers.\n\nMembers of Thowheed groups are also in conflict with other more inclusive Muslim groups including Sufis, who have built shrines for example. The Thowheed movement also removes the love for money, according to those who are familiar with the ideology.\n\nTrends in modern-day Islam as promoted by the Wahabi or Muslim Brotherhood go against what has happened with other religions, which have become more moderate as time went on.\n\nGreeks and Romans, who had a vast pantheon, could quickly assimilate the God of the next city-state or country it conquered. The Indo-Greeks readily assimilated Buddhism, and the statues and Buddhist art now seen is the result.\n\nHistory shows that it has been the practice of all monotheistic religions to slam any syncretism as heresy.\n\nIt is a bit peculiar that Nazi-style nationalism has erupted in Sri Lanka and Myanmar despite Lord Buddha not preaching monotheism or any hate whatsoever. The Buddha did not get involved in religion or even deny that gods existed.\n\nBut it is clearly happening in Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Whether Theravada Buddhism – at least as promoted by some monks – is more susceptible than Mahayana to nationalism is also a phenomenon that may require further study.\n\nBut that nationalism against minorities worsened in Myanmar with the military dictatorship loosening its grip and trend towards popular vote is clearly seen.\n\nHistory has shown that when a group of people promote that a sect or peoples as pure, whether pure race Aryanism or Thowheed, the consequences tend to be tragic.\n\nOther observers have commented that in Sri Lanka, nationalists, including sections of the media and clergy are using the Mahavamsa as the Bible has been used, and the Koran is being used now to foment hatred.\n\nMixing politics and illiberal religion has always been a recipe for disaster, and it backfires on the people themselves, as it is now happening in the Middle East.\n\nAs some commentators have pointed out, the Muslim community must take note of these developments and take action. Secular nations with Muslim majorities are already taking action. Both the Wahabi and Muslim Brotherhood movements have been active in trying to uproot secular leaders of majority Muslim nations.\n\nThe Sinhalese who have control of the polity seems to have little knowledge that the path taken after independence necessarily leads to conflict and slaughter of innocents, and it is no longer possible to blame foreign domination after gaining self-determination.\n\nRed Flags\n\nPost-independent Sri Lanka has been too much like Germany or Romania or Hungary, which should have raised red flags long ago.\n\nThat it did not, is probably due to a gap in education. Not that education under the British gave any understanding of nationalism. But Nazism proper had not come at the time.\n\nThe July 1983 attacks, the current anti-Muslim attacks are dead ringers for the Nazi Kristallnacht of 1933.\n\nThe boycott of Muslim businesses is also a copy of Judenboycott. Calls for boycotts started long before Muslims displayed any type of militancy or even political action and dates back at least to the writings of Anagarika Dharmapala.\n\nThe Sinhala only act, and language requirements also had many precedents in Europe, including the Nazi Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service.\n\nIt is well accepted that no one other than a Sinhalese (or Sinhalese Buddhist) can become the Prime Minister or President of Sri Lanka, in a de facto ‘Aryan paragraph’.\n\nDe facto ‘laws’ accepted by everyone are sometimes more effective than actual legislated ones.\n\nSri Lanka’s relentless intellectual opposition to liberalism, the worship of power and authoritarianism, is also troubling and is a sign that things cannot improve fast.\n\nOne reason for the worship of dictatorship is the same reason it happened in Germany. The Social Democrats, messed up the economy and could rarely agree on anything, which led to a call for a ‘strong man’ to fix it.\n\nThe current administration also has no discernible economic ideology, there have been too many interventions followed by currency collapses.\n\nThough they used the popular vote to come to power, Nazis had no respect for the parliament and made laws through gazette. The Nazi’s also did not like capitalism or free markets, which was common to all European fascists. All fascist economies also collapsed eventually.\n\n“An over-refined democratic parliamentarianism that today seems almost grotesque found its last and highest expression,” Joseph Goebbels once said. “It provided the stage on which National Socialism rose to power.\n\n“We told our opposition often enough that although we were using its weapons and rules for our purposes, we had nothing intellectually or politically in common with them.\n\n“To the contrary, our goal was to use these means to put and end to them and their methods, to finally eliminate their theories and policies. Both in theory and practice, National Socialism opposes liberalism.”\n\nWorld War II in particular and in many ways World War I also was driven by Pan-nationalist aggression based on a specific mindset.\n\nThe alignment of the Ottoman/Turkey with Germany and later Japan with Germany goes to show that they were not the same as wars fought in the past.\n\nIn Europe and the US, white nationalism is on the rise. India, which had long been a secular state, is changing under the BJP. Nobody seems to want to learn from the past."
