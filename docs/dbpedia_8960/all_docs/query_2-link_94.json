        "text": "Shallow Equilibrium\n\n31. XII 2023\n\nAnd those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music. (Friedrich Nietzsche)\n\nWhy does every good idea turn out bad? The French Revolution and liberté/égalité/fraternité morphed in a relatively short time into the reign of terror, the October Revolution to Stalinist purges and its subsequent euthanasia, Cuban denial of capitalism to extreme poverty and isolation. Despite its progressive agenda and rebellion against the conformism of the 50s, the 1968 uprising produced the socioeconomic conditions that gave birth to neoliberalism and institutions which evolved into a radical antithesis of its fundamental premises. Capitalism’s global triumph of the 20th century gave rise to extreme inequality, poverty, and production of human misery where, after a series of endogenous crises that eroded its capacity to underwrite a stable society, resulted in the chaotic epilogue of its unwind with the realistic possibility of its descent into Fascist dystopia.\n\nEvery initially positive social change inevitably turns into a nightmare as if evil always manages to find its way unobstructed and without resistance. Good (and honest) acts always catch us by surprise. They are unpredictable because every good act is committed impulsively; it is not natural and spontaneous. Evil, on the other hand, acts naturally — we never wonder about it, we are surprised only if it is not realized. Evil is transient, it divides — people do evil things in order to survive or get ahead. Good is the essence of sustainability, it unifies, but represents the denial of (human) biology.\n\nIt appears that, almost without an exception, there is an evil bias in every social change. This is more a play of the laws of probability than the consequence of deep social laws or divine forces.The universe (both physical and social) evolves from less to more probable configurations. Bad/disorderly outcomes are always more likely than the good/orderly ones — entropy (in aggregate) always increases. Disorder prevails, but on occasions when local order arises somewhere, it can only happen if its creation ejects enough disorder elsewhere so that the aggregate entropy ends up higher. Order is an oddity — an unlikely configuration; it has a lower probability than disorder.\n\nThis systematic drift which tends to push the system in the wrong direction is showing up in full bloom at the moment. It is amplified by an additional component linked to the current intersection of economic and social crises.\n\nDowngraded metastability\n\nEconomics is a linear science defined around an equilibrium determined by the mode of social organization. However, in capitalism, economy and society interact in a particular way. Capitalist economy erodes the social landscape on which it operates; it makes long-term concessions in order to finance its short-term successes and in that way erodes stability and compromises its longevity and survival.\n\nThe best illustration of this interplay is offered by the Covid pandemic. Unlike previous episodes of recessions caused by financial and economic wrongdoings which had social consequences, the pandemic was a social crisis with economic consequences. In the past, the heaviest burden of recession was carried by the lower social strata – after the recovery, they emerged worse off while the top rebounded and continued roughly even relative to their pre-crisis standing. During the pandemic, however, there was a total devastation of the social bottom. At the same time, with a large chunk of the fiscal stimulus landing on the balance sheet of the 20% wealthiest individuals and corporations, the very narrow and selected top recorded a triumphant rebound with unprecedented multipliers. Tesla, Apple, and the bulk of the tech sector more than doubled in record time. This was a spectacular bifurcation of wealth and social stratification which outlined the contours of the predatory and zero-sum nature of the oligarchic top and underscored unambiguously that the massive concentration of wealth is the main source of production of poverty – a qualitative shift not seen before in capitalism’s turbulent history.\n\nSo, here we are. When all is said and done, after a long sequence of crises, we are facing a paradigm shift and social change that could give birth a new equilibrium. But what kind of equilibrium should we expect? Here is a short recap to the vocabulary needed to navigate this landscape.\n\nEquilibrium is the site where forces of restoration of order compete with those of disorder. Depending on the relative strength of those two forces, there can be several types of equilibrium.\n\nStable: The original configuration is regained after a disturbance — forces of restoration overpower those that take the system away from equilibrium. (e.g. residing in a valley). Unstable: Even the tiniest deviation from equilibrium is fatal – forces of restoration are too weak for even the weakest shocks – this equilibrium is not viable and the system leaves it permanently (for example, a ball on the top of the hill: when it starts rolling down, it never returns).\n\nStable and unstable equilibria\n\nMetastable: The system is locally stable, but can be destabilized by sufficiently strong shocks. A dimple on the top of the hill is a landscape with metastable equilibrium. Standing up is a state of metastability: If we are pushed slightly, we will remain standing. However, if the push is sufficiently forceful, we will fall.\n\nMetastable equilibrium\n\nIn its late phase, capitalism has degenerated into a state of downgraded metastability. Normal conomic business cycles consist of booms and busts with cyclical crises. In general, recovery from each crisis is financed by social deficits. So, after a while, crises become deeper and social deficits bigger demanding a heavier hand in handling them. In that sense, the economy interacts with the society and in that process, it constantly erodes the social landscape which determines the equilibrium. In particular, when cumulative social erosion becomes so massive that it demands a social change, in the interregnum before the actual change takes place, the system is operating near the bifurcation point experiencing a contestation of multiple equilibria corresponding to possible final destinations representing the anticipated social changes. In that regime, forces that take the system away from a local equilibrium are comparable to or weaker than the restoring forces. At that point, all possible social configurations have similar probability of being realized — the system operates around the shallow equilibrium.\n\nBifurcation point and shallow equilibrium\n\nNear the shallow equilibrium, the system loses its robustness – it becomes vulnerable to seemingly benign shocks, which can produce sizeable effects of long duration and consequences leading to positive feedback and endemic instability. In this configuration, social stability can be threatened further with (normally insignificant) low probability disturbances and trivial public communications maneuvers like conspiracy theories, abuses of free speech or a general arbitrariness in informational dissemination which can disrupt society’s normal functioning.\n\nThe four paths\n\nThe onset of capitalism’s gradual unwind started in the late 1980s as a loss of equilibrium after the collapse of communism. The more convincing signs of the immanent exit from capitalism began to show up at the beginning of this century with new monopolized modes of production and contraction of the reserved pool of labor amplified by the emerging new technologies leading eventually to increased precarity and further social deficits. These trends were further reinforced with the GFC in 2008, which further eroded the fragility of political legitimation of the system. What followed was the widening scope of the crisis of permanent exclusion and the prospect of the emergence of failed states in the developed world as the excess population – those who could no longer be reintegrated into the normal rhythms of society — began to approach the critical mass.\n\nThe tensions of the last decade were accelerated by the collapse of liberal democratic mythologies which underscored the active quest for new myths in the midst of that crisis. Everything that used to mobilize the libidinal forces of the developed West is now dissolving in light of the devaluations of these myths, while waiting for new ones creates a troubling disequilibrium.\n\nThe preview of the four paths into the future might very well be a prelude to the most radical and, at the same time, the most significant transformation of capitalism after the industrial revolution. It is an announcement of the socioeconomic blowback, the arrival of times where social deficits will have to be reconciled and managed.\n\nThe three paths that were identified by Immanuel Wallerstein[1] should be seen as the attraction centers which will define the dynamics of socio-economic developments in the next decades. Democratic fascism: A semi-inclusive, cast-like division into two strata where 20% of the world keeps the remaining 80% in submission – an old wine in new bottles already tried out with different ratios that had failed because of the flawed math; Neo-feudalism: An exclusive, highly inegalitarian world of parcelized sovereignties (an equilibrated form of the current times of trouble), with consolidation of fractionalized structures into bigger entities with highly vertical structure, like multinational corporations, global crime syndicates…, but without endless capital accumulation as the mainspring. Egalitarian utopia: Decentralized, inclusive system achievable through political sophistication and technology; not necessarily socialization of poverty, but geared towards egalitarian distribution. Its legitimation is supported by evidence that short-termism leads to undesirable long-term outcomes.\n\nThe fourth path\n\nAccording to Wolfgang Streeck, capitalism is collapsing under its own weight, dying from the overdose of itself, from being too successful, it is disintegrating, but not giving way to a better alternative. As an economic system, capitalism is showing an advanced decline in capacity to underwrite a stable society. What is likely to follow after such a disintegration of a system is a prolonged period of social entropy and disorder[2]. Out of all possible paths, this is the most radical outcome, one that is without a historical precedent and one we seem to be least prepared for. It corresponds to the Interregnum, disintegration of society as such — a perpetual anotherhood of undead capitalism, pregnancy without childbirth — a trajectory where the times of trouble continue indefinitely.\n\nRentism, oligarchic repositioning, and the crowning of the techno-feudalism\n\nDemocracy implies that people share common values and interests. But, in an economic system that fosters high concentration of wealth and greater inequality, there are fewer common interests. Neoliberal politics has managed these tensions by engineering a cultural divide and culture that no longer serves to shape consensus but to continue to polarize. In this way, democracy has become less viable as a political system. This program has created a positive feedback loop that has continued to reinforce divisiveness as a political management tool. In the end, the society has expressed the desire to change away from democracy because division has become unbearable.\n\nThere is a considerable will and capital aimed at steering the postcapitalist world towards a configuration of fractionalized sovereignties resulting in a neo feudal mode of social organization. The actors behind these efforts are driven largely by the opportunities that such reorganization offers/promises rather than any concrete ideological motives. Conservative think tanks and political fringe organizations have already worked out a rather detailed plan of how to dismantle and reorganize the remnants of the capitalist state in order to position for the transition to the new social configuration and are waiting on standby to place their candidates in positions from which they can represent their interests with maximum efficiency. They are following closely the template of dismantling of the state apparatuses in post-communist countries and their planned metamorphoses into failed states. Ironically, the most vocal opposition to this program have been not the Progressives, but the political Center, which has been driven into an uncomfortable coalition with the progressives. They are the defenders of the compromised and outdated neoliberal capitalism and believe in the possibility of its salvation. Blinded by capitalism’s great run and biased by the absence of a clear vision about alternatives, these addicts of the status quo see the current predicament not as the endpoint in capitalism’s evolution, but as yet another cyclical crisis.\n\nWhile on the surface it appears that the spectacle of the current Republican presidential candidacy is the main worry for the political Center, this is only a temporary distraction. The problem runs much deeper. The background forces of the far-Right supporting the neo feudal alternative would be ready to embrace any viable candidate for the occupancy of the highest office that would facilitate implementation of their plan of transformation. The 2024 elections are just the first round of that battle which is likely to continue in the years to come.\n\nThe demented ideas of the plan for the Right-wing takeover have been outlined in Project 2025. The specter of the autocratic visions of that project as a blueprint for a turbo charged MAGA agenda goes beyond the immediate electoral prospects of the current candidate. As Jeet Heer argues the recent The Nation article, Even if [Conservatives] lose in 2024, at some point another Republican president will reside in the White House. And, the hope is that, they will almost certainly enact the autocratic policy vision of Project 2025, with the help of the radicalized think-tankers who now staff GOP institutions. The Project 2025 agenda to undermine the civil service is already being echoed by other Republican presidential hopefuls[3].\n\nBut things are much more non-linear. For example, as the article points out, American Compass, a think tank that contributed heavily to Project 2025’s section on labor policy, is getting funding from some extremely wealthy progressive donors with an aim to blend current conservative vague rhetoric of economic populism with actual policies. These are liberal players aiming to defeat left leaning policies from the center primarily targeting the position of labor. This play from both sides strengthens the Right by giving it more respectability than they currently enjoy. It helps elevate Right-wing ideas as being normative by creating a false consensus backed by wealth and distracts attention from their manifest undermining of democracy[4].\n\nWhat resides behind these initiatives is the rapid takeover of the new modes of production that are encountering resistance from the old and antiquated social structures. Effectively, we have already entered the technofeudal zone. This transition is a slightly distorted mirror image of the transition from feudalism to capitalism that took place in the late 18th century, which was driven by the shift of power from the owners of land to the owners of machinery, steamships, and electrical grids, and the shift of wealth creation from a rent accumulation to profit making. Current, technologically spiked reversal of this process consists in replacement of the feudal lands with digital platforms and shifting corporate profits to platform-owners’ rent[5].\n\nCompanies like Amazon and Facebook have been operating away from the markets and they represent the new techno-feudal oligarchy. Their profits are not based on production, but on collecting rent from their platforms for selling other companies merchandize for which they charge a substantial margin, sometimes as much as 60%. At the same time, they distribute minimal amounts of their profit in terms of wages. Normally, for corporations of the Fordist economy these numbers reside near 90%. In contrast, for Amazon this is 1% and for Facebook 5%. This asymmetric accumulation of capital sucks money out of the system. The math is simple: If you get paid without working, then someone has to work without getting paid.Toxic concentration of wealth results in overproduction of poverty. But this is just one of the side effects of this transition. In addition to that, central banks have to print money to compensate for this secular decline in money supply, the action that becomes manifestly inflationary and inhibits saving, elevates uncertainty, and increases precarity further.\n\nThe fauna of Right-wing agitation: Lumpen billionaires and lumpen capitalists\n\nThis transition to new modes of social organizing, and the underlying economic opportunities it could create, promises a huge return to early birds, the new emerging nobility of luck, which Sam Farber refers to as lumpen capitalists. They are the post-industrial version of original robber barons of the early America. They come from hinterland places like Grand Rapids, Wichita, Little Rock and Tulsa. Their fortunes derive from real estate, private equity, casinos and services ranging from private armies to chain usury. These lumpen billionaires are dependent on the domestic market, and indeed often on federal and state governments[6]. In the past decade, the far-Right wing of conservative politics gave national leadership, media attention, and political legitimacy to a plethora of far-right groupuscules, ranging from the “patriot” militias that started to emerge in the 1990s to the Q-Anon conspiracy theorists with their uprising culminating on Jan-6 2021 as the new Waco.\n\nThe vacuum caused by the ongoing collapse of neoliberalism and the shallow equilibrium that has emerged as a consequence, is the result of an inability to imagine the world without capitalism precisely by its most obvious victims, a Stockholm syndrome of a sort. Lumpen capitalists are seizing this moment to leverage on the buildup of pseudo-nostalgic sentiment to sway the conditions in their favor.\n\nIn this configuration, heterogeneous stages of social and economic development coexist simultaneously. As Alberto Toscano argued, desperate farmer, an unemployed worker or marginalized and/or bankrupt citizen are easily seduced by the ghost of history, which was suddenly released by the crisis, especially in a country with a substantial fraction of population with Fordist dependency[7] like manufacturing, mining, and other segments of disenfranchised subproletariat facing the prospect of permanent exclusion fostered by the new technological advancements and paradigmatic shifts in the modes of production.\n\nThis is the path to re-contextualization of the current American conservative utopia. In reality, Republicans are fighting for their bare life. Beyond concerns for their short-term survival, their only vision of the future is society as an atonal pseudo-totalitarian operetta without a key or meter, the kingdom of arbitrariness where words have no fixed meaning and actions no consequences. They are acutely aware of these changes and their long-term implications and have already begun their transformation process to reposition for the new modes of social organization and wealth distribution. The centrists are still in denial, fixated on status quo and beliefs that the old system of neoliberal capitalism can be salvaged with a face lift that could thrive in the new paradigm.\n\nWith the imminent unwind of neoliberalism on the horizon, power is back in vogue and the future looks increasingly more authoritarian.\n\n[1] Immanuel Wallerstein, Historical Capitalism with Capitalist Civilization, Verso (2011)\n\n[2] Wolfgang Streeck, How Will Capitalism End?: Essays on a Failing System, Verso (2016)\n\n[3] Jeet Heer, Why “Liberal” Donors Love Giving Money to the Extreme Right, The Nation (24 Nov 2023)\n\n[4] Ibid.\n\n[5] Yannis Varoufakis, Techno-feudalism: What Killed Capitalism, Melville House (to appear in February 2024)\n\n[6] Mark Davis and Adam Schatz, Catholics and Lumpen-billionaires, The London Review of Books podcast and https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Lumpen_Bourgeoisie\n\n[7] Alberto Toscano, Late Fascism: Race, Capitalism and the Politics of Crisis, Verso (2024)\n\nRise of the Primitive Society of the Future\n\n24. X 2023\n\nWe invested reality with the whole of the imaginary, but it is this imaginary that is vanishing, since we no longer have energy to believe in it. (Jean Baudrillard)\n\nThe nature of the Hegelian flow of history is, in essence, the social version of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Societies/civilizations evolve from more ordered (less freedom) to less ordered configurations (more freedom). Entropy, in aggregate, always has to increase, but if it does not, if local order for some reason arises, it has to eject enough disorder elsewhere so that the total entropy of the universe increases[1]. As the system ages, order becomes less likely and maintaining forced order becomes costly and those costs increase with time.\n\nFrom the very beginning, civilization and religion had been on the collision course. Religion and its adherence to a fixed structure, acted as a resistance to disorder and became the main entropy-reduction force. Its inner conflicts with the flows of history were not visible initially but became more pronounced with advancements of science, individualization, and the general emancipation process. Religion’s intrusion into everyday life, as a consequence of its excessive secularization and the loss of territory to science, had only amplified its conflict with society.\n\nAt the same time, the Freudian trick of the human psyche — prohibition of enjoinment always turns into enjoinment of prohibition — was in full play. Religious axioms became a major point of contestation. What will become cherished human rights had been in direct conflict with basic tenets of religion, as if, with every step of social progress, these religious axioms were asking to be broken. The religious ban of adultery collides with the entitlement to privacy; pursuit of happiness with the ban to steal; right to bear arms with thou shalt not kill; freedom of religious belief with the commandment against worshiping false gods[2]. As society moved to more permissive and tolerant modes, the conflicts only increased.\n\nModernity was a referendum on the desire to transcend the contradiction between religion and historical flows of civilization. Its arrival interrupted the turbulent millennium and, after centuries of religious dominance, put a temporary stop on humankind’s addiction to religion. In effect, modernity was a result of a buildup of discontent with and a rebellion against the tyranny of the divine order. At its core, modernity represents the first instance of the large-scale transfer of power and responsibility in history. Unhappy with how God managed the affairs of the world, man put himself in charge.\n\nBut, as much as modernity outlined the path of man’s distancing from religion, it also paved the way for its return. The disappearance of divine authority and the process of emancipation that was triggered, created problems of their own. The world was rendered transparent, demystified and, ultimately, hollowed and deprived of its richness.\n\nThe proliferation of cult-like authoritarian figures in the Age of Reason was a knee-jerk reaction to the disappearance of central authority which continued to reverberate for several centuries. The developed West had to wait till the mid-20th century for a more systematic and coherent response to the underlying withdrawal symptoms when the market emerged as a surrogate, which temporarily filled the vacuum created by God’s exile. At the peak of the neoliberal post-industrial phase, the market attained the status of a separate entity that was worshiped like a pagan deity and to which society sacrifices social prey in order to appease it. This defined the contours of a new social structure: The primitive society of the future.\n\nAngels in America\n\nToday, the world stands divided facing the bankruptcy of its old narratives, largely as a consequence of an irreconcilable divergence of experiences, beliefs, and imagination. As divesting from reality in the form of parody, mockery, or masquerade has taken its toll, the growing fraction of the disillusioned population is eager to be mobilized by new narratives. However, as Jean Baudrillard observed, they are, at the same time, unable to receive them due to years of symbolic hollowing out, which deprived them of the capacity to surrender to any collective cause that transcends individual interests. Religion is returning, but in a perverse form, as a parody of itself and without its magic spell, as a grotesque reflection of reality and without any of its original substance[3].\n\nThe chart is the chronology of religious belief in 21st century America, which tells the story of religion’s perverse return. There are three distinct patterns to note here.\n\n1. The trend and population growth\n\nAt first glance, there is an encouraging sign of collective downward trend suggestive of gradual emancipation (from the clutches of religion): Since the beginning of this century, the fraction of population that believes in God (in the most advanced economy in the world) has declined by about 15%, from the staggering 90% to the still mind-boggling 75%.\n\nAlthough this emancipatory trajectory seems undeniable, when combined with the fact that each decade the population in America increases by about 10%, it turns out that, regarding religion, about the same number of Americans are still where they were 20 years ago, but the entire (positive) natality has been driven by non-believers. Believers are not disappearing, they are just being outnumbered.\n\nThis has created an uncomfortable sense of urgency among believers suggesting that they are gradually getting squeezed out, that their numbers are not being carried by the trend of population growth and that, in cultural terms, their breed is facing an existential threat. These sentiments are resonating heavily with the declining natality figures across the Western world facing a similar perceived threat and paranoid projections about their replacement with the above-trend growth of predominantly Islamic immigration and displaced populations there. In America, these trends are further amplified by the changes in racial mix across classes, together with various socio-economic developments, which have artificially inflated the sense of urgency among the white evangelicals and various religious fringe elements, which have been the major mobilizing forces of diverse nativist groups and their quick spiraling into proto-fascist authoritarian political movements.\n\n2. Basic biblical illiteracy gap\n\nThe 15% gap between those who believe in God but not in the Devil, can have several origins. That segment of the population could reflect just basic biblical illiteracy, like people who are simple religious for social reasons and don’t want to be bothered by the details of its implementation. For them, the existence of God creates a comfort zone, it decomplexifies a number of issues that would otherwise require a stock of knowledge and discipline of thought. It is a short-cut through the generally rising complexity of the world. Inhabitants of this gap can also come from the folks who subscribe to alternative versions of religious interpretation that don’t require the Devil, only God. Either way, without the Devil, God is the origin of both good and evil – everything that happens in the universe, be it good or bad, is his will. These implications, when taken to their final consequences, tend to lean towards more fundamentalist interpretations which legitimize all evil deeds — if God exists, then everything is allowed. So, while the religious base has been in decline, their beliefs are drifting towards more fundamentalist interpretations, and their conviction grows deeper.\n\n3. Risk parity gap\n\nThe most intriguing pattern, however, is the 10% persistent gap between those who believe in heaven but not in hell. While the basic Biblical Illiteracy Gap concerns the divine hierarchy and stands removed from this world’s affairs, the Risk Parity Gap has a direct impact on how folks should conduct their lives. Its existence is an ultimate statement of conviction in unaccountability. In absolute terms, a steady 10% over two decades is a growing number of people. In 2000, this meant about 28mn, while in 2023, it was 34mn. This gap goes beyond basic biblical illiteracy. These are not religious-ignorant, but truly religious folks who agonize about the real state allocation in the afterlife. For them, this asymmetry means that there are only rewards and no accountability in the afterlife and so one can continue to sin with impunity. In other words, it is impossible to commit a sin for which one will have to atone, so why bother with guilt, morality, right, and wrong.\n\nThis gap is the ethics-free zone — religious suspension of the ethical at work, designed to inoculate against moral dilemmas – the lebensraum of hard-core libertarians who do as they please regardless of how it affects others, the ideological creed encoded as the unconditional pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe Risk Parity Gap captures the core of the basic flaw of the fundamental premises of the American experiment. Since its inception, America has stood as a symbol of impunity in the unilateral penetration of unexplored areas and a new frontier that embodies the spirit of globalization and risk taking. What in normal circumstances would be characterized as looters, were in fact pioneers and early settlers, which arrived before the land registers. The armed land-taker acted under rules more suitable to the definition of crime rather than noble participation in the exploration of the world[4].\n\nAfter several centuries of plunder and destruction of indigenous life, this criminal conduct got a divine stamp of approval in the form of Manifest Destiny, which became the password for the disinhibition of action and the underlying code of optimism, which constitutes the true national language[5].\n\nThe perverse return of religion\n\nIf what we experience as reality is structured by fantasy, and if fantasy serves as the screen that protects us from being directly overwhelmed by the row Real, then reality itself can function as an escape from encountering the Real. (Slavoj Zizek)\n\nReligion has always played a dual role. On the one side, it defines a point (in human evolution) that corresponds to the moment of self-awareness and introspection – by positing an imaginary observer (a divine entity) to whom we ascribe a number of attributes and continuously adjust our behavior so that it becomes more pleasing to Him. On the other (practical) side, religion acts as an anesthetic by creating an imaginary layer that manages the traumatic encounter with the realization of our mortality. In both cases, religion functioned through the channel of Real/imaginary/reality: We escape the raw Real by creating an imaginary layer, which in turn structures our reality in an essential way.\n\nThis has changed in a profound way in the last three decades. Religion in the West has returned in its degenerate form as a device for management of capitalism’s excesses. We are escaping the raw (traumatic) Real again, not the existential (biological) immanence of our mortality, but the inevitability of capitalist self-destructiveness.\n\nBy opening the doors for the return of God through vulgar materialistic interpretations, religion is no longer the imaginary layer that structures our reality, but a device that legitimizes the ongoing capitalist excesses, its trespassing and suspension of the ethical as salvation from our enslavement to capitalism.\n\nIn premodern times, religion acted as a source of friction in historical flows which has grown with time to become a significant, but nevertheless surmountable, obstacle able to be transcended by social change (e.g. modernity and enlightenment). In contrast, contemporary religion possesses neither ontological nor palliative function. Rather than operating as an anesthetic through an imaginary layer, it now serves to validate the existing reality and its underlying contradictions, and to compromise the possibility of change. In that process, it reverses historical flows — society turns away from freedom and embraces the authority and power.\n\nThis transformation of the role of religion is happening in a society with the most advanced levels of social atomization exhibiting, at the same time, the maximal disagreement with basic axioms of religion. While atheism in Europe has become a fully legitimate option and its most precious legacy, America no longer has that option and remains trapped in the vortex of its own unresolved past which continues to suffocate it, without offering any venue of escape[6]. In its perverted form, religion in 21st century America has become an unsurmountable obstacle for the flows of history; it stands to normalize societal contradictions and prevent their resolution. This is the beginning of the end of the Hegelian historical continuum — achieving true freedom by reaching the end point of no resolution, by freely submitting to what has become necessary because true freedom is having no choice.\n\n[1] After three quarters of a century of peaceful and orderly life in the global north, there is a growing chaos everywhere else in the world.\n\n[2] Slavoj Zizek, How to Read Lacan, W.

XII 2022\n\nWe are not alcoholics because we drink; we drink because we are alcoholics (S. Basara)\n\nPrologue: The touchdown\n\nAmerica rose from the Atlantic like an auxiliary universe in which God’s experiment with mankind could be started from scratch – a land in which arriving, seeing and taking seemed to become synonymous. While, in the feudalized and territorialized old Europe every strip of arable land had had an owner for thousand years, and every forest path, cobblestone or bridge was subject to age-old rights of way and restrictive privileges in favor of some princely exploiter, America offered countless arrivals the exciting contrasting experience of a virtually lordless land that, in its immeasurability, wanted only to be occupied and cultivated so as to belong to the occupier and cultivator. A world in which the settlers arrive before the land registers — a paradise for new beginners and strong takers[1].\n\nIntrospection: Risk-taking and chance nobility\n\nSince its inception, America stood as a symbol of impunity in the unilateral penetration of unexplored areas[2] and a new frontier that embodies the spirit of globalization and risk taking. It was the land of escapism and new beginnings with no baggage of history and tradition, and few rules; an unstructured community of risk-takers where everyone had the same initial conditions. What in normal circumstances would be characterized as looters, were in fact pioneers and early settlers. The armed land-taker, a farmer under God, acted under rules more suitable to the definition of crime rather than noble participation in the exploration of the world. After several centuries of plunder and destruction of indigenous life, this criminal conduct got a divine stamp of approval in the form of Manifest Destiny.\n\nAmerica lacked its hereditary and institutional nobilities. But, as luck was the only metric of distinction, it defined one of its own, the nobility of chance: individuals who had become rich, famous and favored in their sleep, and who never quite understood what had carried them upwards[3].\n\nOn the clean slate of new beginnings everything was subject to change, an anomaly that went against the grain of the mores of the stability-obsessed Middle Ages. Until the late 20th century, America retained its status as a site of pure potentiality. It had no past, only future and was whatever it imagined itself to be, that unique place where anyone who wants to do something new can do something new and where the code of optimism constituted the true national language[4]. But the most unique (and the most troubling) aspect of American subjectivity, which defines the essence of its antisocial core, was the Chosenness, the American password for the disinhibition[5] of action and appearance on the world stage.\n\nThis motif has created a stage where exception to the moral law could be taken. In Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment this argument is summarized in Raskolnikov’s statement to the prosecutor:\n\nIn short, I argued that all people – not only the great, but even those who deviate only marginally from the common rut, that’s to say who are only marginally capable of saying something new, are bounded, by their very nature, to be criminals – to a greater or lesser degree, of course. Otherwise they would find it hard to get out of the rut, and it goes without saying that, again because of their nature, they could not possible agree to remain in it.\n\nBelonging to the chosen people empowers one to commit crimes as a way of performing his duty of removing the obstacles to the new posed by the ordinary people, the destruction of the existing reality in the name of one that is better.\n\nThis is the logic that had defined the spirit of the New Continent from its discovery. In his letter to Doña Juana de Torres, Christopher Columbus wrote: Our Lord made me the messenger of the new heaven and the new earth, of which he spoke in the Book of Revelation by St John, after having spoken of it by the mouth of Isaiah.\n\nSelf-deception: The great accounting fraud\n\nSome memories have to be buried and forgotten because they contradict the optimism of the big picture and some other will be used to build the official version of the “good history”. And so the history began.\n\nThings could never fully add up in the land of new beginnings. Luck is a zero sum game – it has both winners and losers. This (simple) fact collided with the puritanical code — there are no losers, only people who wallow in self-pity – and its existence had to be kept out of the public sight and political discourse. By deliberately manufacturing a mythical image of America and its past, the power of the past can be used to transform those that are governed and shape their subjectivity.\n\nThe great American accounting fraud — hiding the losers in the gambling hall of pursuit of happiness[6] – has been an ideological maneuver intended as depression concealment, which covers the abyss beneath every failed fortune-seeker. But, with time, the accumulated deficit of luck grew so big that it could no longer remain hidden and its burden became unbearable in the early 21st century. Its resurfacing defined the wounded subject of postmodernity.\n\nWith time, America has become a country with vanishingly few paths out of poverty (or even out of the working class) and after several centuries of the American dream, the direct lineage from the early settlers and risk-takes – the committed aficionados of luck – found themselves at the bottom of the social ladder which gave birth to the culture of victimhood.\n\nThe accidentally wounded white American male subject, an ousted member of dominant and privileged majority, has become a collateral damage of capitalism’s global triumph. Beaten in just about any game that matters, even the ones they invented, they have joined the ranks of excess population on the way to irreversible social displacement and marginalization.\n\nThe emergence of the American wounded subject in the new century was immersed in nostalgia for the times of new beginnings, a demand for another chance to those who found themselves lost in the game of luck, competition, and meritocracy.\n\nAt the center of their uprising resides Ressentiment /rə,säntə’män/, a psychological state arising from suppressed feelings of envy and hatred that cannot be acted upon, a dormant emotional sediment caused by the loss of privileged position. Not sufficient to mobilize political action, it remains inactive and intoxicating.\n\nThis condition resulted in armies of disillusioned individuals who have committed themselves to chemical escape from American reality.\n\nIntermission: The rebirth of the subject\n\nSubjects are distinguished by their capacity to act – formation of a subject requires diffusing the inhibitory mechanisms in order to eliminate the regression of endless doubt instrumental for converting “theory” into actions. The easiest way to create disinhibiting mechanisms is to subject oneself to the command of a higher authority.\n\nThe modern right-wing populist uprising is modeled on the Jesuit mode of subjectivity, which consists of absolute surrender to supreme authority (the pope), cultural manifestations of the ability to suffer, and conversion of suffering into passion.\n\nContemporary victims of neoliberal capitalism retroactively see their newly found world in support of interpreting their history as a repressed memory of systematic abuse. Their version of American reality is a hysterical reaction to failure with subjectivity defined by their coming out, no longer needing to hide and admitting to the abuse[7].\n\nTheir impassioned rage is mobilized through flood or arbitrariness with an aim of manufacturing reality from improbable possibilities through a populist cacophony of God, victimhood, entitlement, male privilege, ressentiment, and sovereign citizenry. The underlying discontent is contextualized through conspiracy theories and fusion paranoia. What used to be the terrain of fringe movements has become so deeply ingrained in the mainstream politics that the paranoid style has become the cohering idea of a broad coalition plurality that draws adherents from every point on the political spectrum.\n\nWith their recent leader out of the picture, defenestrated, embarrassed, and discredited, the march of victimhood of angry citizens not only did not slow down, but it continued with new intensity and higher granularity. They offer impassioned conversion of their suffering and, like modern-day Jesuits, stand as passive followers offering their unconditional obedience to the highest bidder, a prospective new “pope”, who would elevate their victimhood, pledge their votes, and monetize their rage capital.\n\nEpilogue: Reverse flows from the netherworld\n\n2022 confirmed what previous years already outlined. In the last 12 months, the number of mass shootings in America exceeded 600 again, only marginally lower than the previous year’s record 692, and two times as high as in 2015 when the identitarian orgy got a new dose of legitimacy. These killings have become the micro representation of the rebellion of unreason that illustrate the final phase of transformation of the game of competition into a competition of cruelty.\n\nFor the chosen, failure and mediocrity is forbidden. But when the number of those who fell through the cracks grows so big that they become a community of like minds unified by shared victimhood and their new sense of belonging, the power of collective self-pity becomes a force of its own. The community is generally inclusive, which reflects a fear of small numbers — it likes size because it reinforces cohesion and identity robustness. It absorbs everyone willing to join in but expresses hostility to outsiders – burning bridges reinforces commitment to the identity.\n\nThe stealth approach of stochastic terror is the beginning of an uprising from the inside – a blowback of the American dream, its nightmare version — an autoimmune reaction of the system driven by the extrapolated logic that human life is worthless if it stands in the way of the pursuit of happiness.\n\nTired of self-abuse, anesthetized by drugs and alcohol, disillusioned white males have taken permanent residence in a conflicting configuration between life as they wanted it and life as it has been. They have been lost in their desperate search for a savior who will restore their (perception of) lost dignity and self-respect, and reclaim, on their behalf, what they always considered rightfully theirs, the privilege of luck.\n\nAngry and armed with guns, but feeling powerless, they are taking a short cut in externalizing their depression through a simulated ritual of frontier justice and revenge for their predicament by denying the future to the innocence the way it had been denied to them.\n\nThis is the baggage of the American dream, which reinforces the late-Shakespearian perception of humans as competition-infected, jealousy-blinded, failure-scared risk-takers, which appear on the world stage as balls with which illusory powers, malign genies, money spirits and greed demons play their games[8].\n\nIn imperial Rome, Fortuna, the goddess of luck, was primarily the protector of slaves and destitute plebeians who depended entirely on chance and the generosity of the rich. In America, she had found another constituency as a protector of the new nobility of chance and turned its back on the poor.\n\nThe nebulous reality of the American dream has become the story of divine betrayal and its latest chapter represents an uprising against the new divine order. And this meaningless rebellion will not stop until the actual victims finally begin to speak and reflect about their history in honest and clear terms. Not when they tell themselves fairy tails about themselves, but when they start connecting the dots and drawing the lines.\n\n[1] Peter Sloterdijk, In the World Interior of Capital, Polity (2013)\n\n[2] ibid.\n\n[3] ibid.\n\n[4] ibid.\n\n[5] ibid.\n\n[6] ibid.\n\n[7] The disinhibiting value of confession is another Jesuit motif of subjectivity – in its modern version, survivor transcends his trauma completely only when he can make it public as a testimony.\n\n[8] ibid.\n\nThe Economics of Repulsion\n\n7. XI 2021\n\nIn traditional capitalism, the supply of commodities is finite and their exploitation leads to depletion of the supply. By mining coal, diamonds or drilling oil, access to these commodities becomes increasingly more difficult, which requires deeper mines, oil drills, and more sophisticated technology, all of which increases production costs. For a fixed demand, this reduction in supply results in a rise of perceived value and higher price.\n\nIn cognitive capitalism, where information is the main commodity, the imbalance resides on the opposite side. Its economics is governed by diminishing demand. Human attention is biologically limited – there is a finite amount of information our brains can absorb and store at any given time. Supply of information, on the other hand, is unlimited and comes practically at no cost – ideas can come out of nowhere (or as a result of the general intellect) and, in principle, cannot be exhausted.\n\nSince everyone is competing for the same fraction of our (limited) attention, sooner or later cognitive capitalism becomes a zero-sum game. For a brain already overloaded with information to pay attention to something new, it has to neglect something else. Every spec of information, every new idea, therefore, has an inherent ephemeral quality and carries a potential of becoming worthless.\n\nIn order to insert itself into the tight space of the already saturated attention space, new information has to be able to shock. It does not necessarily have to be relevant or carry semiotic value; it only needs to be sufficiently loud to overpower other voices. And, in competitive markets, such loud information wins and gradually dominates. Cognitive capitalism, thus, inevitably leads to semiotic inflation — more information buys less meaning – and ultimately to hyperinflation when information carries no meaning whatsoever.\n\nMetabolic disorder and addiction to shocks\n\nAs an ideology that disseminates market values to every segment of life, neoliberalism has naturally aligned with the new logic of social media and the diminishing demand of the attention economy. Once one allows the market to impose its values and criteria, society becomes subordinated to it and has to be managed as its auxiliary. As an adaptive system, neoliberalism has adjusted to the new chapter of cognitive capitalism by transforming society and conditioning political subjects to its new laws.\n\nNeoliberalism makes citizens into consumers. As consumers, today’s voters have no real interest in politics or in actively shaping the community; they react only passively to it. Politicians and parties follow this logic of consumption too. They have to deliver. In that process, they become nothing more than suppliers; their task is to satisfy voters who are their customers.\n\nSociety of the spectacle and the attention economy, when put together, result in new politics defined by the explosion of affects, revenge, and peddling in highly improbable. Through interaction between technology and politics, society gradually becomes addicted to shocks — they need to be administered continuously and without interruption.\n\nImmunoreaction and informational fatigue syndrome\n\nShock is a kind of immunoreaction. A strong immune system stifles communication – it impairs its fluidity – the lower the level of immunity, the faster information circulates. A high level of immunity slows down the information flow. Immune-suppression, on the other hand, allows massive quantities of information to penetrate our souls without immune defense.[1]\n\nPolitical foreplay, in the initial stage, consists of preparing its constituents for the new landscape by weakening their cognitive immune system. Once political subjects are properly conditioned, politics is administered through barraging them with a constant flow of nonsense in order to wear down their immune system and create a metabolic disorder[2] (akin to an eating disorder). Their minds are constantly stimulated – the underlying information becomes a semiotic equivalent of junk food — the less meaningful the information and the more toxic and addictive its effects are, the more marketable it is.\n\nAccording to Walter Benjamin, the primary mode of a spectator’s response to cinema was one of a shock: Shock replaced contemplation that came as cinema replaced painting. However, we are no longer shocked by images. Even the most disturbing images have been made consumable[3].\n\nShocks now have to contain another quality that relies on different kind of imagery and the target audience needs to be conditioned to receive them.Media outlets are increasingly playing on repulsion rather than on seduction — response to pleasure is too diverse while response to repulsion is the same. Anxiety gradually replaces excitement while persistent exposure to the semiotic excess of informational barrage leads to what B.C. Han calls informational fatigue syndrome (IFS), which progressively weakens our analytic capacities and monopolizes our attention.\n\nIn our reaction to ambiguously disturbing images emerges a new category representing the repulsion we cannot resist.\n\nRepulsion as political leverage and emergence of the emotionalized electorate\n\nIn its essence, Right-wing populist politics in Europe is not dissimilar to its American counterpart – it revolves around conservative budget spending, pseudo-Christian values, certain types of cultural iconography, and self-centered xenophobia. However, their mode of articulation cannot be more different. European right-wingers and their politics, as much as one finds them disagreeable, their delivery is coherent – they speak in meaningful sentences, their thoughts have a logically consistent flow, and address the problems of shared reality, which one might agree with or contest and argue on rational premises.\n\nIn the USA, however, shared reality no longer supports the tenets of whatever the conservatism has become, which stand in trivial conflict with facts and is rendered demonstrably false and indefensible, invalidated by the long history of failure and bankruptcy. Defense of the right-wing narratives in the USA requires the creation of an alternative universe where not only are the shared reality and observable facts ignored, but the underlying laws of economics, sociology, biology, physics, the probability, and even mathematics have to be suspended. The end effect of this environment is removal of all systems of reference where the mental instability of a single person in power easily mutates into a large-scale collective affliction with defenders and advocates of that politics turning into performance artists in a state of simulated self-induced mental illness.\n\nIn cognitive markets, where shocks amplify informational impact, the more repulsive the messengers, the easier their message penetrates the barriers erected by the compromised public immune system. Self-debasement becomes the statement of authenticity and repulsion a desirable quality.\n\nTwo examples of this mechanism at work:\n\nRight-wing broadcasters and political consultants, which have elevated their appearances to the level of performance art, tend to wear their shirts one size smaller and buttoned up all the way to the top, so that it causes an authentic discomfort and irritation giving them a slightly deranged and agitated look, an emotion which gets transmitted to their emotionalized audience.\n\nAnd speaking of undersized garments, the infamous sighting of Christy’s camel toe represents a singular example. Once seen, never forgotten, this historic picture — a visual equivalent of eating durian — cannot be accidental, despite its spontaneous appearance. Such extreme deficit of self-awareness simply does not exist (not to mention the discomfort wearing of these pants must have caused). It is not a fortuitously captured moment of leisure of the former New Jersey Governor, but a product of meticulous calculation of the teams of specialized PR consultants.\n\nThese, and other similar, images are carefully crafted so that they continue to shock, irritate, and disgust because these are addictive emotions; they provide a lifeline to the outrage conglomerate. In this way, any possible resistance of the opposition is automatically thwarted and their collaboration ensured from the outset. They have been taken hostage by this vortex of addictive repulsion. Opposition media outlets are placed in a conflicting position where their bottom-line disincentivizes resistance. As much as they would like to oppose the new ideology of repulsion, they cannot afford to wound, let alone deal a defeating blow to it – nobody would pay attention to them anymore, which would ultimately wipe out their revenues and put them out of business. This mechanism sustains otherwise lifeless and non-sustainable narratives.\n\nThe objective of politics is to never break the chain of emotions set in motion by a shock. Their synchronization has become the new way of governing and the community of emotions replaces the community of interests resulting in communism of affects[4].\n\n[1] B. C.

IX 2021\n\nThree quarters of a century after his death, Goebbels is back in vogue. After the 2020 shipwreck, Republicans are fighting for their lives. Desperate and pissed off, they are coming out as a full-blown Nazi party, taking Goebbels’ playbook as a gospel, pure and undiluted, as if no other books have ever been written. There are no more pretenses — anti-Semitism, racism, and misogyny are alive and well in America today with open support for white supremacy in all its modes and hasty legislation of outdated segregationist policies. MAGA-pride events, the culturally adjusted burlesque versions of Nazi conventions, have replaced country fairs and have become magnets for angry, aggressive, and comically stupid folks. New blood is being mobilized to carry out Brown-shirt activities and half-assed attempts to model their own martyrs (Ashli Babbitt as a modern day Horst Wessel) on Nazi folk heroes.\n\nWithout a program or agenda, and armed with strategy of fully randomized focus targeting, everything is in the mix (hoping that something will stick): The Constitution, first (and second) amendment, race (critical and uncritical), education, prayer in schools, American history (and anti-history), slavery, 1619, white replacement, immigration, misogyny, abortion, climate change, wealth distribution, student loans, taxes, recounts, voter suppression, insurrection, swastikas, sedition, civil war, Republican math, Florida man, flat earth, space travel, Taliban, Hunter Biden, media, influencers, Moonies, masks, vaccines, Fauci, Ivermectin, Jews with (and without) lasers, cousins in Trinidad, and, of course, Jesus.\n\nBy its design, the new, 21st century gumbo of neo-Nazi propaganda has become the key identifier of growing masses of excluded, grotesquely ignorant folks whose anger and self-pity, caused by their precarity, trumps rationality, logic, science, and their own economic interests, safety and well-being. The high marketability of the Nazi-style response to populist rage is the new frontier for the transparently dishonest media outlets who, in search of attention, publicity, and ratings are willing to cross the boundaries of century-old social and political taboos and get on the other side in order to get ahead of the competition or just stay in the game.\n\nA logical question emerges at this point: Why do we have to go back to these issues again? After all, these are outdated ideologies with a well-documented chronology of their inadequacy and chronic failure (social, economic, political, moral). Is fascism turning out to be the strange attractor of modernity and is its periodic recurrence unavoidable?\n\nDespite its extreme nature and excesses, what happened in Germany in the 1930s was a logical inevitability of the Western civilization and its intellectual tradition. Evil is an intellectual need of the mind, which meditates about good. Intellectuals made evil logically necessary upon funding the idea about a better world. It is, therefore, no wonder that the origins of WWII reside in one of the most developed countries with the strongest cultural tradition in the Western world of that time.\n\nAfter WWII was over, while the victors indulged in the narcissistic righteousness of its aftermath, Germany emerged richer with insights, which had remained unregistered by the allies. Through an unprecedented defeat, they [Germans] have been brought to the unwanted but valid insight that national identities and ethnic missions are in principle nothing more than violent and violence-producing collective autohypnosis. Consequently, they have developed a relationship to the missions of history that resembles that of a sober alcoholic to their former drug[1].\n\nAnd while modern Germany has retreated from the manic historicity and forever abandoned the idea of being a chosen nation, the victors saw, and continue to see, WWII as just another round in a tournament for international supremacy in which one competitor (Germany) had been eliminated. They (the victors) never abandoned the dreams of their own supremacy — their individual or collective visions of the future have been nothing but projections and fantasies of their domination extending to their logical extremes[2].\n\nAmerica seems to have gone the furthest in that direction. Economically prosperous, but, at the same time, neck-deep in shit, largely due to its own self-neglect and gross mismanagement of its fortunes, it remains narcissistically in love with itself (for all the wrong reasons). Paradoxically, this is especially true for those segments of the American population that have been the victims of said neglect. In the last years these folks have been in a state of a post-coital narcissistic orgy and have become a petri dish for the same collective auto-hypnotic identity politics and self-discovery that Germany went through a century ago.\n\nBy the end of the first decade of the new century, the gap that separates every disgruntled member of the excluded white sub-proletariat in America from the clutches of white supremacist rage has shrunk so much that it takes only a moment of inattention for any member of that community to falsely interpret their personal misery, deserved defeat, and bitterness as the sad faith of America, which, if we are to be honest, with such whining, pitiful and comically ignorant constituents, never really deserved anything better.\n\nThey failed in the game, which they invented, maintained, and defended at all cost, and now, they want another shot at it, but with altered rules, ones that would guarantee their advantage. This is the core of the microsolidarity and fractal belonging of the current identity politics. It is also fascism at its purest.\n\nAnd as the saying goes: All comedies of history happen twice; the first time they are bloody, and the second time ridiculous. When the final receipts were written, the 1900s turned out to be a bad century for Germany. It was also a turning point for America as the leading cultural and economic global force. Now that baton has been passed, it is America’s turn. So, here we are.\n\n[1] Peter Sloterdijk, Infinite Mobilization, Polity Press (2020)\n\n[2] ibid.\n\nTexas\n\n5.IX 2021\n\nIdentity code has a generally excluding effect capable of mobilizing negative energies and social forces towards those who do not share the same origin, territory or culture. Fascism is the fundamental obsession with identity, origin and belonging. It is a knee-jerk reaction to physical and social displacement. Fascism is generally inclusive, which reflects a fear of small numbers — it likes size because identity robustness had been eroded by the defection and erosion of ranks. It absorbs everyone willing to join in and expresses hostility to outsiders.\n\nWhile there are many varieties of fascism, they all have one thing in common: Misogyny resides at the origin of each and every one of them – there hasn’t been a fascist movement without it. It’s never been too difficult to mobilize enough male solidarity when it comes to organized misogyny. By questioning the external norms that relate to the position of men and women in society, man has and had nothing to gain and everything to lose: he would lose not only social and economic advantages, but something far more precious, a sense of his own superiority which bolsters his ego both in his public and private life[1].\n\nThe fundamental cohesive force of fascism always begins with a male bonding ritual of masculinization of cultural self-perception. In Italy, for example, early 20th century fascism represented the turning point from feminine self-perception to masculine assertiveness: Erasing feminine quality of its Mediterranean sensitivity – everything that makes life there pleasant and seductive — and affirming a different self-image based on acceleration and male potency (national pride, military aggressivity, industrial growth, etc). German fascism, on the other hand, was not a programmatic cultural defeminization, but rather an establishment of systematic downgrade of femininity to reproductive function as a part of the new nation-serving hierarchization. Its essence was a utilitarian placement of women as birth factories, their subordination to the interests of the National Socialist political agenda (run by men), to serve the numbers.\n\nWhen seen in the context of the most recent developments, the new intensity of the American misogyny appears less of an anachronistic anomaly and more as a logical consequence of the current political struggles. The debates (and the present escalation) of the Abortion law – the topic that had been put to rest in the remainder of the world a long time ago – is resurfacing now, at this particular moment, not in the light of its renewed relevance or urgency, but as an opening act for the new chapter of fascism. It is showing here in a more convoluted way than it had 100 years ago because the social and cultural displacement of the 21st century Western man has triggered new modes of identity politics.\n\nModern day misogyny is the ultimate male fantasy of the Western conservatives structured around a nostalgia for the times of lower entropy, a return to the past as a site of coherence, and a relapse to the patriarchal setting when man held their “naturally deserved” upper hand and (a male) God ruled the world. Through misogyny this man articulates the desire to reclaim what he considers his “natural right” to control women and, in that way, take control of his own destiny.\n\nConservative man’s vision of woman is not objective, but an uneasy combination of what he wishes her to be and what he fears her to be[2]. The masculinization program and return to patriarchal values (the most coveted axiom of any right-wing politics) and assault on women’s rights and their position in society, if they are to be successful, would have to be deeper, gradual, and systematic. This means undoing the women’s emancipation. The tactical approach of conservative politics is that the masculinization program requires a proper framing and subtle maneuvering — women must not be antagonized; they are many and they vote. In their view, the most effective approach is to strike at the root of a woman’s influence.\n\nNo one has more influence on a person during their formative age than their mother. As such, she is a constant threat to both the state and to men in general. The decision of life and death has to be taken away from women. Their influence and importance in the life of their children have to be diminished, if not de facto, then, at least, symbolically. Right to life! This is ultimately the question about who has jurisdiction over the life of an individual, their mother/family or the state (ruled by men, of course). With the help of proper framing, this becomes the theme that defines the core of conservative identity politics, an issue slowly hijacked by (predominantly white) men who feel righteous and entitled, and present themselves as defenders of human life while women take a back seat.\n\n[1] Eva Figes, Patriarchal Attitudes, Persea Books (1986)\n\n[2] ibid.\n\nWhat More Needs to Happen before Something Happens?\n\n22. VIII 2021\n\nOur everyday life is peppered with illegal activities – its normal functioning would be practically impossible without discretionary transgressions of the law. We jaywalk every day, regularly drive above the speed limit, and use cellphones while driving. And who hasn’t littered at some point in their life? For a long time, smoking marijuana or taking drugs have been considered rights of passage for many, while sharing you password or downloading music, movies or books is done continuously without even an afterthought. In certain states in America, non-procreative sex is still illegal and in some countries like Iran it carries a death sentence. Nevertheless, people systematically, and sometimes exclusively, engage in those practices as a matter of sexual preferences or lifestyle choices.\n\nThis aspect of casual transgression is well understood by both the citizens and the authorities. However, actions of authorities are almost never aimed at their systematic suppression. Police functioning is most effective when everyone is breaking the law. The purpose of the law and law enforcement is to make you a potential criminal and for the police to have an option to declare you an actual criminal at any given time[1].\n\nOnce this is done, once you have been declared a criminal, the court does not initiate a trial and possible sentencing, but instead pressures you to plead guilty and accept your criminality. This is more effective in the long run – once you have confessed to your criminality (in order to serve a lesser sentence or go free with a slap on the wrist), there would be no way of complaining or objecting to the consequences. In this way, you move closer to an easily governable docile subject. This is governmentality at its purest.\n\nHowever, the situation is markedly different when non-individual entities are concerned. When an entire congregation or political party breaks the law systematically, this becomes a sign of possible civil disobedience and unrest, which requires urgency of intervention, especially if their followings are of negligible size. In that case, any attempt to prosecute those people can be diverted into a political struggle and, as such, become a defense against abuses of power.\n\nGenealogy of a Political Hysteria\n\nThe seeds of the Jan-6 clown coup, and with it, the radical reshaping of the Republican party, most likely started as a consequence of the previous Oval Office occupant’s failed attempts to extort some kind of blanket immunity from prosecution by his successor. The repeated failure to successfully ensure such a package led to escalation in the negotiations and threats, most likely never intended to be realized, but, as the new President elect called his predecessor’s bluff, things went beyond the point of no return. As matter got out of hand in this game of miscalculated leverage, and assumed an unintended dimension with grave legal implications, some key figures of the previous administration became implicated and compromised.\n\nClearly, the whole Jan-6 thing wasn’t conceived to be anything but a threat. No one in his right mind would think that a few hundred people breaking into the Capitol would amount to keeping the losing candidate in office. Keeping the Congressmen as hostages and asking that the Election results be reversed? Or what? The mob executes them? The noose? Only a total moron (and there were plenty of them in DC on that day) could believe that this could amount to anything. All of that was intended to be nothing more than a threat to push the Republicans in Congress to vote against certification in order to drag things further so that the new administration, in order to keep things under control and finish the whole charade, finally settles for a sweeping pardon. Nothing else.\n\nWell, that didn’t work as planned, so here we are. For those involved, the consequences have become non-trivial. The latest transformation of the Republican Party into a pseudo-criminal collective is a result of dealing with those consequences.\n\nSince almost every Republican still sees the support of Trump’s base as a must-have on their political path, the implicated leaders have compelled others, either by dirt or by promises of endorsement, to join in and create a shift from individual to collective criminality. With that maneuver, the underlying allegations of the Republican top would be converted into a collective liability of the entire party, which would transform the defense of the idiot-coup into a political struggle.\n\nClearly, this cannot be, in any possible context, a sustainable platform of a political organization. It is a losing proposition in an environment where political victory is won within 1% majority. It is really a desperate attempt to diffuse the culpability of their leadership and prevent consequences to take place.\n\nThe cold civil war\n\nThe democratic process was originally conceived as a way to peacefully resolve economic disputes between people who share common values, either cultural, religious, or in terms of lifestyles or visions of the future. As such, democracy requires commonality; inequality undermines it. When, however, inequality reaches the critical point, when interests diverge so much that consensus is no longer attainable, the bonding tissue that keeps society together begins to tear and democracy becomes compromised. In the absence of commonality, disputes can no longer have peaceful resolve. Instead, the resolution occurs through negotiation or war[2].\n\nDespite being abundantly and unambiguously clear what happened on and after Jan-6, the response has been annoyingly gradual. The effect of subsequent diversion of blame from individual to collective was to increase the already existing division and elevate the tensions, which have been accumulating over the past years. The escalation caused by the Republicans’ coming out as the white supremacist party has transformed those tensions into a cold civil war.\n\nThe legal and political disputes related to the Jan-6 events are now happening against a highly combustive social background where the underlying social tensions have already crossed the point of no return. The most acute problem, therefore, is how to avoid the cold civil war from heating up.\n\nThe current situation has become explosive — it is configured like a booby trap. And, when facing the problem of its deactivation, one does not just come in and cut the wires — one wrong move and the device will explode. Deactivation must proceed slowly and sequentially, first by figuring out who is connected with whom and only then can the cutting really begin.\n\n[1] This argument, I believe, is due to Slavoj Zizek.\n\n[2] Jeffrey A. Winters, Oligarchy, Cambridge University Press (2011)\n\nDeath & Life in Utopia for the Stupid (a flashback)\n\n19. VII 2021\n\nThe rational is always the rationality of an irrational (Fèlix Guattari)\n\nIf utopia represents the impossible [imaginary places where social relations are represented, contested, and inverted], and developed society has reached the point where (almost) everything is possible, then the problem of finding our way is no longer the problem of disappearing utopia, but the problem of vision and politics[1]. So, what is the neoliberal utopia really like? What is a logical extrapolation of the neoliberal experience and what could be the next frontier for its all-around permissiveness?\n\nOf all the issues that have emerged in the last years, murder has been the most divisive. From police brutality, to vigilante killings, mass murders, shooting of cops or innocent bystanders and terror attacks. All these cases were really about who has the right to kill whom, and at what price. Black lives matter, terrorism, the OJ Simpson trial, the idiot coup … they have all been about the same theme: Is it ok for whites to kill blacks, for Muslims to kill Christians, for rich to kill poor, or even for the rich blacks to kill not-so-rich whites, etc.? There has always been some implicit hierarchy of rules in that space.\n\nIssues that have played a similar divisive role in the past have been alcohol prohibition, teenage drinking, abortion (right to life), legality of drugs, prostitution, gay marriage, speed limits, etc. In many countries where these issues have been put to rest, tensions and problems associated with the issue have disappeared.\n\nIt is common sense to assume that removing an aura of taboo reduces the appeal of the vice. By legalizing something, one eliminates the challenge and reduces the abuse. For example, incidence of teenage drinking, drunken driving etc. are much lower in countries which have no minimum drinking age, and similarly in the case of car accidents vs. speed limit. In the same manner, one can argue, that the legalization of drugs could lead to lower incidence of drug abuse and a reduction in crimes associated with illegal drug trafficking. Same holds for prostitution. The upside of legalizing these activities is that society becomes less polarized – people get along better with each other – and, once divisive aspects are removed, politics becomes more constructive.\n\nUtopia for the stupid\n\nStupidity does not understand context. It assumes knowledge and extrapolations of experiences to contexts where those do not belong and often cannot hold. This is the summary of neoliberalism’s essence and its destiny as an ideology premised on applying the laws of the markets to life as a whole. In the final days of the unraveling of the neoliberal reign, this has become the era of stupidity. Therefore, entertaining the counterfactual reality that reflects the future as a neoliberal utopia of permissiveness, by allowing for its virtual triumph and applying its patterns and rules to situations where they do not belong, should be done based on the same foundations of confused contexts and argued with the same logic as the ideology itself.\n\nBy analogy with the well-know cases of causal connection between bad habits and their status of social taboo, it is fair to ask the same question regarding murder. Following the logic of neoliberal reasoning, one can argue along the following lines:\n\nFirst, in America, there is an insane number of murders every year. By now, we probably have more than one mass murder for each day in the year. Obviously, the fact that murder is a capital offense is no detractor for killers; the rate of killing (individual/random/mass) keeps increasing. The legitimate question to ask then is: Would the number of murders decrease if they were to become legal? Following the same line of reasoning as with drinking or drug abuse, one could argue that most likely, there would be an initial surge, but then the trend would gradually subside and a new lower equilibrium murder rate reached.\n\nDeath by shooting would gradually be accepted as a consequence of our freedoms, in the same way as death caused by traffic accidents, plane crashes, fire, or natural disasters have.\n\nThe benefits would be immediately visible. First, guns would get the status of a regular appliance, like car or TV — everyone would own (at least) one. This would be plain common sense. All debates about the second amendment would become obsolete and with them the polarizing effects would go away. There would be no justification for the existence of the gun lobby. The NRA would be rendered politically irrelevant and politics, free of its influences, would be able to focus on issues that matter. Without polarization around the second amendment, republicans and democrats could even merge into a single party.\n\nSmart guns would become the new technological frontier. Apple would produce first iGun, synchronizable with iPhone and iWatch, and Teslas would come with special road rage software and appropriate smart guns usable in such situations.\n\nCompulsive killing would be frowned upon. It would be deemed uncool, along the lines people treat compulsive eating and obesity. There would be awareness groups that provide counseling and talk shows where compulsive killers would be subjected to public shaming.\n\nThe US would enter its post-political phase. There would be less need for police; private protection would be the new area of economic expansion. There would be far fewer people in prisons, both private and state-run. No debates about the death penalty or life sentences? All these would free the federal budget for more constructive projects. People would be much more considerate and respectful of each other’s feelings. Conflicts would tend to be avoided. Everyone would be nice to each other (assholes would have a very low chance of survival). Generally, people would get along much better. Right?\n\nAt the end, it would be every man for himself, just as Margaret Thatcher said: There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. These thoughts represent the basic axiom of neoliberalism and its sociopathic core. It, therefore, doesn’t come as a surprise that, when stripped of the constraints of moral judgment, the utilitarian logic of neoliberalism, if applied consistently and carried to its final consequences, inevitable leads to over-optimized dystopian world of sociopathy. A sociopath truly practices the notion of morality developed by utilitarianism. He need not necessarily lack intelligence, but on a landscape of normal human interaction, he is lost – that is what defines his affliction. For him, morality designates a behavior one adopts by way of intelligently calculating one’s interests (in the long–run, it profits us all if we try to contribute to the pleasure of the greatest number of people). A sociopath sees morality as a theory one learns and follows and not something one identifies with: [in his universe] doing evil is a mistake in calculation, not a guilty act[2].\n\n[1] Fredric Jameson, An American Utopia: Dual Power and the Universal Army, Verso (2016)\n\n[2] Slavoj Zizek, How to Read Lacan, W.

(Peter Sloterdijk)\n\nIn the autumn of 1914, a human life was infinitely more worthless than in the autumn of 1913. WWI was an abyss, a near-unfathomable crisis of civilization, and one of the most important issues that needed to be addressed in its wake was precisely the worth of the human being[1].\n\nThis question would set the tone and meter of the political discourse to come, its echo extending beyond the remainder of the 20th century, without ever losing its relevance. It would only assume different forms and granularity as its context changed, its mutation continuously adapting to different modes of fascism and identity politics, which defined the metrics for the relative valuation of human life.\n\nBefore and during WWII, it was the value of Arian vs. non-Arian lives (fascism). In occupied territories in WWII, Germany had a simple algorithm, precise and unambiguous, displayed in public for everyone to know: For each German killed, they would execute 100 randomly picked locals. In the second part of the 20th century, which Immanuel Wallerstein had coined as the realization of democratic fascism[2] whereby 20% of the global population exploits the remaining 80%, the debate shifted to the relative worth of American vs. non-American lives. In backlash to western hegemony, the Islamic dilemma was articulated through Islamo-fascism and terrorism with the discourse defined by a different valuation of Muslim and infidel lives. With the gradual normalization of neo-fascism and white supremacy in the new century, the debate shifted (back) to white vs. non-white and natives vs. migrants.\n\nIn today’s America, this problem is currently struck around quantifying the value of Black lives. It is not an entirely new debate, but the socio-political backdrop is. The narrative behind the current ritual of white supremacist coming out and their clownish uprising rests on the belief that, contrary to the overwhelming evidence, Black lives are valued fairly, if not even overvalued. Persistent and deliberate police brutality against Black people is but a particular way of transmitting this message, and so is the normalization of white supremacy with white replacement paranoia, the glorification of slavery, voter suppression, the exorcism of critical race theory from the school curriculum, and general revisionism.\n\nDelirium\n\nThe embrace of a regressive revival of racial tensions defines the delirium of the current socio-political counterpoint. It is a moment that desperately demands collective introspection. Here, we have to be careful to avoid the trappings of conventional (Freudian) psychoanalysis defined relative to an Oedipal axis (which locates the roots of our problems in sex and family). What is currently at play requires a different perspective, defined by Deluze and Guatarri as the anti-Oedipal:\n\nThe real problem of delirium lies in the extraordinary transition from the pole of reactionary or fascist to a revolutionary pole. Statements like ‘I belong to a superior race’ appear in all paranoid deliriums. Similarly, ‘I belong to an utterly inferior race’ is a revolutionary pole of madness[3].\n\nThe excluded white precariat is torn between these two poles, unable to decide where they stand or belong, and where they want to be. They have managed to lose their way in the interstices of the anti-Oedipal perspective. The decades of erosive acrobatics of ideological maneuvering have made this point especially ambiguous in a way that, although neither one is correct, both appear equally plausible and seductive.\n\nTrapped in what Wendy Brown considers the neoliberal trauma inflicted by neoliberalism’s accidental wounding of the white male supremacy[4], the white underclass remains transfixed between a self-pity of collective victimology and an unwavering sense of superiority and entitlement, all these emotions grossly misinterpreted, misdirected and manipulated, standing as a testament to their anachronism.\n\nThis ideological terrain had been already claimed and appropriated by the conservative Right, resurrected as the Right Wing populism, which has latched onto the underlying white discontent as their lifeline and the last point of rescue from their own obsolescence. In a bizarre symbiosis between the super-privileged and the super-marginalized segments of the white American population, conservative leaders have taken upon themselves the role of speaking on behalf of the poor so that the poor wouldn’t speak for themselves: We want to include you in the decision without letting you influence it. Through carefully structured narratives and divisive memes, their rhetorics are framed as a culture war, which insures that the underlying rage capital of the white precariat remains properly invested and its supply never stops growing.\n\nEntropy\n\nThe current crisis of politics is unlike anything seen before. It hasn’t been brought about by chronic scarcity, economic devastation or depression. It has been driven by an undeniable realization that exploding wealth and prosperity has repeatedly failed to underwrite a decent, or even acceptable, life for a growing majority of people amidst the unrestrained accumulation of wealth of a shrinking minority.\n\nEntropy cannot decline, it must rise – systems always evolve towards less orderly state. This means that order always comes at a price: Local order can happen so long as it ejects enough disorder to its surroundings that the total disorder raises. Peaceful social life means that one party, the ruling one, has already won. Interfering with that – taking over by another political faction – creates an upheaval and disruption of peace.\n\nExploding inequality, which comes about when extreme prosperity is financed by extreme exclusion, eventually tips the scale and leads to a buildup of latent systematic violence that does not know, and is incapable of acknowledging the existence of, any bounds. At some point, this latent violence begins to permeate every aspect of social and political life and along the way creates the state of the general exclusion principle: [Y]ou cannot calculate both the current [social] position of an individual and his or her velocity of exclusion, [e.g.] advancement of women and their virtual downgrading[5]. It is impossible to distinguish causes and effects or to isolate subject from object (are Republicans hostages of their base or is the base their victims). One can grasp either the appearance or the meaning, but not both at the same time (we cannot tell whether GOP politicians only act as morons or they are actual morons). Ultimately, we can no longer calculate the price of a human life and its statistical value at the same time[6].\n\nNihilism of value and the fight for human soul\n\nHow did we get here? What is the big loss and trauma humanity had experienced that has led to this nihilism of value, which the neoliberal mutation of capitalism only made intolerable?\n\nIn the past, the human being was not doomed to be merely what he is. God and Satan wrestled over him. In the past, we were important enough to have a battle fought over our soul. Today, our salvation is our own affair. Our lives are no longer marked by original sin but by the risk of failing to fulfill our ultimate potential. So we accumulate plans, ideas and programs; we constantly pass the buck and seek to outdo each other in a universal effort to perform[7].\n\nBy attempting to achieve local order in our lives we eject disorder elsewhere. And as everyone does the same thing, this creates entropy, which continues to grow unstoppably and, as much as we try to avoid it, entropy begins to seep into all pores of everyone’s life. But whom do we turn to when we fail (and an increasing fraction of American population is failing), or whom do we blame for our failure?\n\nIn the absence of transcendent powers watching over us, and in the perpetual effort to validate our existence, we are forced to become ‘fatal’ to ourselves[8]. We romanticize the past and revive its ghosts in order to create a context for the struggle about jurisdiction over the ancestral terrain, its location and boundaries, and the right to map the current reality onto it. This is the only way of bringing back the lost meaning of human life. We need to own the future in order to conquer the past, because this is the terrain on which the battle for our souls will be fought again.\n\nIn what becomes a parody of fate, a leader figure will emerge who will fill that empty place and fight for the excluded and forgotten. And when they find each other, the excluded and forgotten followers will ignore every and all of his shortcomings — no matter how flawed he might be, they will support him unconditionally. He might be the worst human being there is, but they don’t require goodness or humanity from him because he fights for their soul. Nothing else will matter anymore.\n\n[1] Karl Ove Knausgaard, My Struggle Book 6, Farrar, Straus and Giroux (2019)\n\n[2] Immanuel Wallerstein, World Systems Analysis: An Introduction, Duke University Press (2004)\n\n[3] Felix Guattari, Chaosophy, Semiotext(e), New edition (2008)\n\n[4] Wendy Brown, In the Ruins of Neoliberalism: The Rise of Antidemocratic Politics in the West, Columbia University Press (2019)\n\n[5] Jean Baudrillard, Impossible Exchange, Verso; Reprint edition (2012)\n\n[6] ibid.\n\n[7] ibid.\n\n[8] ibid.\n\nBare life\n\n29. V 2021\n\nIn Hegel’s master-slave dialectic, the party who emerges as master does not fear death. The desire for freedom, recognition, and sovereignty raises the master above concern for bare life. It is fear of dying that induces the future slave to subordinate himself to the Other. Preferring servitude to the threat of death, the slave clings to bare life. (B. C. Han)\n\nWhat on the surface appears as a consolidation in the ranks of the post-Q-anon Republican Party, from Hawley’s clenched fist and Lyin’ Ted’s escapades, the psychotic trailer-park vitriol of Boebert and Taylor-Greene to the full immersion of Stefanik, the disoriented and stunningly myopic maneuver devoid of any logic and common sense, is not an ideological realignment, but the fight for bare life – a desperate attempt to secure a financial bloodline necessary for their short-term survival.\n\nWhen seen in a broader context, the collective pledge of unconditional servitude to the rejected and discarded former leader represents the liminal stage in the forced transformation of the American conservatism, which has been following a well-defined and rigid pattern of ritual in its quest for structure, long lost after decades of its own cannibalization. This transformation process has reached the point where its inner contradiction have become so abundant that the party representing conservative ideology can no longer exist as a part of the democratic process.\n\nFor the Republican Party, this is the unconditional moment – a situation that requires the creation of a new set of values and standards, a new picture of the world and one’s sense of self in it. They are confronted with the restrictions and pathological narrowness of their existence, a condition that demands the Party to abandon the security of its limitedness, and enter a new realm of self-awareness. For them, there is no turning back; the whole system of values must change.\n\nRepublicans’ desperate gasp for air is an attempt to answer the existential question forced upon their party: How to respond to a confrontation with the reality of failure — an absolute failure, which one cannot fail to recognize? Answering this question requires entering terra incognita where they come to terms with their underlying incapacities, a transformation process that demands separation from the existing structure.\n\nThe power of ritual\n\nRitual is a social act of subjective transformation, which allows the transformed subject to see the context with different eyes and from a new perspective afforded by the experience of ritual. It usually takes place at an inflection point where the status quo approaches a dead end and functions as a mechanism that converts the obligatory into the desirable.\n\nThe essence of ritual is a play between structure and anti-structure. Irrespective of the context, it is always staged in three acts. The first act consists of separation – this is when the subject is taken out of their context. The second step is the transitional or liminal stage. During this phase, the work of the ritual takes place: The order of things is (temporarily) suspended — participants are in a structureless zone ready to accept new rules. In the final, integration, phase the subject is re-contextualized[1].\n\nAn example of this formal structure, with all three stages is the ritual of the American college experience. After a sheltered (and structured) childhood, where access and exposure to major sources of risk, like excessive time mismanagement, night clubs, drinking, drugs, etc. is restricted either legally or through parental supervision, college kids ceremonially leave their parents’ homes and move into student dorms (separation), the new communal centers where they cohabitate with their peers. Unsupervised and armed with newly acquired fake IDs, they step into the Devil’s playground (anti-structure) with access to alcohol, drugs, sexual experimentation, and a host of new experiences, becoming exposed to the risks and temptations of the adult world. No longer kids and not yet adults, betwixt and between, they enter the liminal stage, in which all rules of either life seem to be suspended. In most cases, the American college experience has a progressive (centrifugal) liminal period, which emerges as a source of potential alternative structures waiting to be embraced after which a successful integration into adult life can take place.\n\nIn the last 4 years, conservative politics has entered the liminal stage, its existence marked by the play between structure and anti-structure. Nothing is ordinary — everything is tremendous. Semiotic excess — lies, nonsense, conspiracy theories, and propaganda — has had the main purpose of perpetuating the ritual, sustaining liminality, and suspending the rules. Palpable falsehoods became new articles of faith, new social identity drew the boundary between us and them and became the main theme of political discourse. Acceptance includes tests of authenticity, which require participants to go through initiation rites in which they burn bridges by committing deep out-of-the-money unethical acts and physical or intellectual atrocities (sometimes all three). This is an ongoing ritual within a ritual consisting of competitive symbolic self-immolation in the arena of public spectacle, which irreversibly closes the doors for their return to pre-liminal life.\n\nIf 2016 was a moment of separation, and subsequent years were liminal, in the current context of political ritual, post-liminal right wing integration is evolving towards the Weberian everydayinization of the out-of-ordinary situations.\n\nThe road to re-contextualization\n\nFor all the good that it has created, money, in its omnipresence as the ultimate metric of value, has had a deleterious effect on society, culture and politics.\n\nDemocracies today are captured and dominated by big interest groups and their money. They still formally function as democracies — we are free to speak and free to struggle — but elections are competitive and their outcomes are not known in advance; they remain constrained by the boundaries set by financial interests of the wealthiest segments of the society. This has become more pronounced as the costs of running (for political office) are getting more and more expensive, further reinforcing the power of big money. It is practically impossible for a candidate to emerge without money – he/she must either be independently wealthy or have the people with money who back them. At the end, politics has become a game of seduction where everyone is funded by someone and they have to conform with the wishes and views of their potential and actual donors.\n\nMoney has flattened everything – it has made every drama, every villain, and every existential or ethical dilemma linear and one-dimensional. Behind every act of evil, there is always a financial position. A madman who is plotting to nuke a large American metropolis in a doomsday suspense drama is no longer a deranged psychopath, driven by madness of revenge against humanity or dreams of establishing ex-nihilo a new world order, but a rational investor who has a short position in commodities, which would be driven in the money by the underlying catastrophe of his design.\n\nThe GOP’s current political ritual of collective lobotomy is not the result of a regressive uprising of autocratic mad villains, but a consequence of the flattening of politics by money. Their apparent suicidal tactics are in reality just posturing meant to serve as a surrogate for commitment. The ritualized loyalty oath to their rejected and defenestrated ex-leader is nothing else but a money-raising scheme. It is a plea of an increasingly marginalized ideology, deemed futureless, running out of the willing oligarchic support, transitioning from an actual political party to a suicide pact which embraces the TV-evangelist business model centered on monetizing on peoples’ misery and stripping the gullible bottom of disenfranchised rubes of their last penny.\n\nThis is the current American conservative utopia and the path to their re-contextualization. Republicans are fighting for their bare life. Beyond concerns for their short-term survival, their only vision of the future is a society as an atonal pseudo-totalitarian operetta without a key or meter, the kingdom of arbitrariness where words have no fixed meaning and actions no consequences, a fool’s paradise in which Ivy-league cohabitates happily with trailer-trash and everyone is allowed to dwell in his/her own stupidity.\n\n[1] This breakdown of the structure and the concept of liminality were first introduced by Arnold von Gennep in 1909, Rites of Passage, University of Chicago Press (1961)\n\nTurmoil and Tinfoil\n\n17.XI 2020\n\nWoke up this morning, decided to kill my ego, it ain’t ever done me no good, no how.
