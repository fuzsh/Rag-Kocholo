At the bottom of a list of names of the sixteen deported Jews, to whom an additional name has to be added, we read in perfect Sütterlin handwriting the cynical sentence, “Süssen is now free of Jews!” In contrast to other places where violence or even physical attacks on Jewish fellow citizens occurred, this did not happen in Süssen. Rather, when the need of the local Jews was greatest, they were secretly supported by a number of Süssen citizens, through groceries that were secretly left on their doorstep, for example. Most of the repressive measures against the Jews were brought into the village from outside. Non-Jewish citizens, too, understood the meaning of deportation. After a Jewish neighbor said goodbye, the son of a couple overheard his father saying to the mother, “They will not return.” Until the beginning of the twentieth century, the village had no Jewish history whatsoever. To be sure, the names Judengasse and Judenzoller are mentioned in old accounts and maps. These hints refer merely to a street for Jewish travelers, for whose use they had to pay a fee. The history of Jews in former Gross-Süssen began in 1902 and ended with their deportation on November 28, 1941, with a brief continuation when three of the sixteen who had been deported, and who survived the hell of the labor and concentration camps, returned in 1945. As was the case in many other villages and towns, the memory of the former Jewish fellow citizens was repressed. Nevertheless, a few Süssen citizens maintained contact with former Jewish residents, especially with Hugo Lang, who was the last to succeed in emigrating to the United States. The passage of time allowed for a more open conversation of the events from the Nazi period. Hence, in 1989, then Mayor Martin Bauch extended an invitation from the city council to the surviving members of the Jewish\n\nF5756.indb vii\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nviii | Foreword\n\nfamilies to visit Süssen. This invitation had a ripple effect that continues to this day. A second impetus arose from the visit of an American professor. Mrs. Gilya Gerda Schmidt teaches Judaic Studies at the University of Tennessee, with a focus on the Holocaust. She was born Gerda Dauner in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt and grew up in Süssen. She remembered from her mother’s stories that Jews also lived in Süssen. In the summer of 1998, she received an invitation to give a lecture at the Evangelische Akademie in Bad Boll near Süssen; she took this opportunity to establish ﬁrst contacts with the town. Since that time the Jews of Süssen have had their historian. In the intervening years, Professor Schmidt has been in Süssen again and again, for many weeks, and tirelessly researched the fate of the Süssen Jews. She likewise explored the fate of the members of the Ottenheimer family. Although the Ottenheimers lived in the nearby district capital of Göppingen, they owned a factory in Süssen that was Aryanized in 1938. For this research she traveled all the way to Cuba, which was not easy for an American citizen. Professor Schmidt’s kindness and human warmth, along with a consistent single-mindedness and diligence, earned her respect, appreciation, and affection from those who came in contact with her. I hope that the book will help to send racism and nationalism where they belong—to the rubbish heap of history. Werner Runschke Süssen Stadtarchivar\n\nF5756.indb viii\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIn spite of our reliance on technology, a project of any kind takes people to succeed, and a project that deals with the fate of human beings and requires a detailed understanding of how a particular local system functions, even more so. Most important for the success of this kind of project are those people who have intimate knowledge of the sources—people who direct and work in archives and libraries in a variety of lands. They are the true heroes of studies such as this, for without their cooperation and help there would be no project. While it is true that research often takes place in isolation, the work prior to sitting in a cubicle with a bunch of dusty folders or newspapers is not the researcher’s, but the expert’s, who ﬁrst locates the sources. And as this project has taught me, eyewitnesses are also indispensable. They, too, are heroes, though of a different kind from archivists and librarians—adding a voice of humanity. Eyewitnesses are the clothes that dress the skeleton of documents that are so essential, yet not sufﬁcient. Nearly ﬁfty years ago I emigrated to the United States, much as a number of Süssen citizens had done since the nineteenth century, some of whom attained success. The credit for maintaining contact for nearly half a century belongs to my classmate from elementary school Gerda Schwenger, née Stahl, who doggedly wrote and called many times over the years. Another classmate and good childhood friend, Beate Lehle, née Ziegler, also sent signs of life periodically. In this way, contact was not entirely broken even after my parents died in 1977 and 1978. Although I envisioned this study about thirty-ﬁve years ago, it began in earnest with a ﬁnd in a used bookstore in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the spring of 1993. While in Knoxville, interviewing for the newly created Endowed Chair of Judaic Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Tennessee, one of my future colleagues, Dr. Rosalind Gwynne, took me to McKay’s, a used bookstore, to show me their Judaica collection. Among the books I found a volume in English with a blue cover\n\nF5756.indb ix\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nx | Acknowledgments\n\nthat bore a gold chai (Hebrew letters yud and chet, meaning life as well as the number 18) on the front that dealt with the Jews of Württemberg.1 In it I found conﬁrmation for the seeming mirage I had carried in my head since my childhood in Süssen, Germany, that there had been Jews living in Süssen until the Holocaust. I recall my mother’s telling me so when I was a child. When, after living in the United States for ﬁfteen years, I returned to Süssen for a visit, my mother showed me a historical study of Süssen, published on the occasion of the 900th anniversary of the town in 1971. Alas, there was no sign of any Jewish presence in it. Nor was I able to elicit any clear answers from anyone on anything related to Jews in Süssen. Today I understand that it would not have been possible in 1971 to publish information on the Jewish citizens of Süssen, it was barely possible in most of Germany to speak about things connected with the Holocaust. The teaching of the Holocaust in German schools did not begin until the 1970s. As my mother died after my visit, ﬁnding this book in Knoxville was the ﬁrst evidence I had that I had not been hallucinating. Now, for the ﬁrst time, I had a few names, though not yet any faces to put with the vague memory of whispers about the Jewish families and the euthanasia victims who had lived in Süssen. It nevertheless took ﬁve more years and the completion of several other projects before I could seriously look into the reality behind this lingering mystery. Much to my surprise, I was neither the ﬁrst nor the only person interested in the subject. The village of Süssen, now under the leadership of an enlightened mayor who was born after the Holocaust, had taken the initiative in 1983 to create an exhibition and accompanying Dokumentation for the citizens to revisit the ﬁfty years since Süssen was uniﬁed in 1933. Assembled by the Volkshochschule (adult education institute), a section of these documents was recycled and expanded in 1989, when Mayor Bauch invited the surviving former Jewish citizens to a reunion, much in the manner of similar ofﬁcial reunions all over Germany.2 The bottom line was not a pretty picture—twelve members of one family, the Lang family, as well as three other Jews not on the Nazis’ ofﬁcial list, were deported for the purpose of ethnic cleansing.3 The triumphant bottom line of the Nazi-era municipal secretary’s list of deported Jews reads, “Süssen is now free of Jews [judenfrei].”4 I was most interested to learn what this statement meant for the victims. I was also curious to learn how Jewish life could have existed at all in a village that had no Jewish community, no synagogue, no rabbi, and no cemetery. What would it have been like to move to a town with\n\nF5756.indb x\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nAcknowledgments | xi\n\nclear divisions along religious lines, where Catholics and Lutherans were strictly segregated not into two parts of town, but literally into two separate towns? Where in this pattern would two Jewish families ﬁt? And how could they survive as Jews with the closest Jewish community ten kilometers away, at a time before the automobile was a common mode of transportation? Professionally and personally, I was fortunate to meet some truly exceptional people who, from the very beginning, showed an interest in my project and offered their unconditional support. First among these are Bärbel and Werner Runschke, who not only once, but repeatedly, have shared their beautiful and comfortable home in Süssen with me for extended periods, and have become not only valued colleagues, but cherished friends. It is fortunate for me that Werner is also interested in altem Glomp (old stuff), though in his case this refers to actual local artifacts such as tools and pottery as well as documents and pictures that tell how it once was. He is a scholar in his own right. Werner sees it as his mission to make sure that Süssen’s local history is preserved.5 I am happy to say that, since we began working on this project together, teaching about the Jews of Süssen has become a regular part of his local history lessons to school classes and visitors. In his capacity since 1993 as Stadtarchivar (director of the newly relocated and reopened City Archive in Süssen at the time I began this research), Werner became an invaluable colleague, facilitator, source of information, and friend. He introduced me to ofﬁcials and colleagues who were able to lend support in various ways. He became my wheels to out-ofthe-way places and trusted comrade-in-arms for photographic and technical adventures. His generous, diligent, and painstaking efforts in helping me locate needed materials, explaining technical terms, and deciphering the Sütterlin handwriting make this book also his book. Together with his wife, Bärbel, they constituted my research team. Bärbel and I enjoyed long hikes and interesting conversations in the beautiful countryside, and she graciously gave of her time to help me decipher tombstone inscriptions and track down buildings. We all beneﬁted from and enjoyed Werner’s excellent cooking and Bärbel’s delicious baking. In a place where most meals contain pork, Werner creatively resorted to delicious vegetarian meals for my beneﬁt. Thank you so much, Bärbel and Werner, for all your support. Any existing shortcomings are mine alone. On November 24, 2006, the municipality of Süssen recognized Werner Runschke’s achievements in educating the local population on their history and customs, when Mayor Lützner awarded him the Johann-Georg-\n\nF5756.indb xi\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nxii | Acknowledgments\n\nFischer-Bürgermedaille mit Bürgerbrief, the highest honor the city can bestow on its citizens and a rarely awarded distinction for truly deserving residents of Süssen.6 Walter Ziegler, director of the Göppingen District Archive, is another valuable colleague. Years of experience with local matters have molded him into a real power. Born in Süssen, Mr. Ziegler served his apprenticeship in the City Hall of Süssen and thus has decades of knowledge about local and regional documentation. I owe him thanks not only for access to all the materials in the Göppingen District Archive, but also for valuable hints regarding sources and materials in other collections and for access to his personal collection. The archive is located in the castle of Filseck, which is a grand historical location in beautiful surroundings. Walter Lang (no relation to the Lang family in this study) was district archaeologist for Göppingen when I started this research. He had already been an interested party in Holocaust research and published several pieces of his own, including some on Kristallnacht in Göppingen. He was one of Hugo and Inge Lang’s hosts during their visits to Süssen in 1989 and 1991 and became the keeper of materials and pictures that Hugo left for the Süssen City Archive. An individual who has truly distinguished himself not only in historical scholarship but also in Jewish scholarship is Dr. Karl-Heinz Ruess, director of the Göppingen City Archive. Dr. Ruess has single-handedly revived a lost community. Göppingen had a vibrant Jewish community that was completely destroyed by the Nazis. Today only one Jewish man who returned from Israel in the 1970s lives in the city. The Jews of Süssen belonged to the Göppingen Jewish community with its brilliant rabbi of thirty years, Aron Tänzer. Dr. Ruess was instrumental in the creation of the Göppingen Jewish Museum, located in the old Lutheran church in Jebenhausen.7 The church houses the benches and the chandelier from the Jebenhausen synagogue, which was torn down in 1905 after the community was disbanded. Much of the postwar information for both the Lang and the Ottenheimer families came from the Ludwigsburg State Archive. This study would not be nearly as complete without the help of Mrs. Michaela Mingoia and her colleagues, who cheerfully responded to the many queries over the past decade. Mrs. Mingoia was a tremendous help in locating information not only in Ludwigsburg but throughout Germany. Thanks are also due to Mayor Marc Kersting, who took on the leadership of the city in 2010, and to the City of Süssen for their hospitality\n\nF5756.indb xii\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nAcknowledgments | xiii\n\nduring my research stays. Thanks also go to former Mayor Wolfgang Lützner and to the employees at the city hall for their kindness in supplying me with technical support during the 2002 stay. I would like to extend a special thank you to former Mayor Rolf Karrer for his personal interest, initial encouragement and endorsement of this project in 1999. Not until 2007 did I meet yet another former mayor, Martin Bauch. I am grateful to Mr. Bauch for reaching out to the Langs when the opportunity arose; otherwise, I might never have found Hugo Lang. Hugo Lang is the only surviving descendant of his family with whom I established extensive contact, because he was the only Lang family member accessible to me; his sister Ruth died at the very beginning of this research, in 2000. Hugo and his wife, Inge, an Auschwitz survivor from Berlin, have become wonderful friends and have given me tremendous support and help. They have allowed me to photograph the entire family album and shared with me stories, letters, documents, and memories. After we met in 2000, my colleague in the History Department at the University of Tennessee, Dr. Kurt Piehler, who hails from the same town as Hugo and Inge in New Jersey, interviewed Hugo for his oral history project. I would like to thank Kurt for sharing his materials with me.8 Inge also wrote down her powerful and sad story to include in this book. The Langs have been gracious hosts during a number of visits to their home for a series of interviews, the most recent in 2010. A few years ago I also had the opportunity to meet a son of Rabbi Tänzer’s, Erwin Tänzer, who was around ninety and, with his wife, Ruth, lived in Pennsylvania. Sadly, Erwin Tänzer died on May 19, 2007. May his memory be for a blessing. A very emotional moment occurred for me in May 2007, after the Stuttgarter Zeitung published a story about this research. Through the generosity of a German tourist who knew Werner Ottenheimer, a phone call while in Germany connected me with ninetyone-year-old Werner Ottenheimer in Havana, Cuba. Finally, there was a living witness to the Ottenheimer story. In December 2007, I traveled to Cuba to talk with Mr. Ottenheimer about his childhood in Göppingen. Unfortunately, Werner Ottenheimer has also died since our visit, on December 19, 2008. And yet another connection was established as a result of the newspaper article. A German friend of Liese Lotte (Lilo) Guggenheim Levine’s, formerly from Göppingen, told Lilo about this research. On August 5, 2007, I visited Lilo and her husband, Mel, in Saranac Lake, New York, where we were joined by one of Lilo’s childhood friends, Isolde Lilli Netter Vandermeulen, and her daughter Debbie. And then, in 2008, Rivka\n\nF5756.indb xiii\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nxiv | Acknowledgments\n\nRibak from Haifa came to Knoxville with her family and, upon their return, her husband Yair made the connection for me with Shavei Zion in Israel which led to a surprising meeting with Alisa Klafter, born in Rexingen, Germany, and a cousin-by-marriage to Hugo Lang. These are rare and special moments that will remain with me forever. A thank you is also due to my classmates from elementary school in Süssen, ﬁrst and foremost to Inge Honold, née Vetter, who arranged a class reunion in 1999, after I had been in contact with only Gerda Stahl Schwenger and Beate Ziegler Lehle for nearly forty years. It was a memorable experience and rekindled childhood friendships. Over the years, I have beneﬁted from reading papers and giving lectures on issues related to this project at professional conferences and in academic settings. These include, in 2000, “The Recovery of Small-Town German Jewish Life: An Example,” Association for Jewish Studies; in 2001, “From Cattle-Dealing to Riga: A German Jewish Family Before and During the Holocaust,” Southeast Conference for the Study of Religion; in 2006, “Recovering Lost Jewish Communities,” East Tennessee History Center, Knoxville; in 2007, “Das Schicksal der Süssener Juden,” Jewish Museum, Jebenhausen, Germany; “Can Grand Larceny and Good Neighboring Exist Side by Side?” “The Case of Two Jewish Families in Rural Swabia during the Nazi Era,” and “Requisitions-Restitution-Reparations: The Story of the ‘Judenhaus’ in Süssen,” all at the University of Tennessee; in 2009 “Süssen is Now Free of Jews,” International Humanities and Arts Conference; “Return to the Black Forest,” Association of Writers and Writing Programs; “Friend or Foe: A Tale of One Family’s Journey into the Holocaust,” Southeast Commission for the Study of Religion; “The ‘Other’ Victims: In a German Village, Perpetrators and Survivors Battle Over Their Victimhood,” Association for Jewish Studies; in 2010 “Suezza—No Grazing Land for Jews,” International Association for the History of Religions, and in 2011 “Stolpersteine—The Mark of Cain or Redemption?” International Humanities and Arts Conference. My thanks to all the colleagues who commented on my work and made valuable suggestions for improvement and expansion. During the past six years I have derived great beneﬁt and encouragement from my colleagues in the German Research Seminar here at the University of Tennessee, funded by the Humanities Initiative of the College of Arts and Sciences. Professors Daniel Magilow, David Lee, Vejas Liulevicius, David Thompkins, Stepfanie Ohnesorg, Maria Stehle, and Denise Phillips not only afforded me the opportunity to present my work for their com-\n\nF5756.indb xiv\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nAcknowledgments | xv\n\nments but connected me with scholars they know who work in German Studies. Thank you for this most stimulating experience. I owe a special thank you to Professors Magilow and Lee, who read and commented on the entire manuscript. Professor Andrew Bergerson, from Missouri State University–Kansas City, as well as Stephanie and Eric Bank likewise gave the manuscript a thorough reading that resulted in many excellent queries and comments. In the fall of 2007 and 2010, I used the manuscript as one of the texts for my RS/JS 385 class on German Jewry. We read and discussed the completed sections, and the students’ comments were invigorating and their questions profound. My thanks to all of the students for participating in these discussions and also for catching some of my mistakes! R. Michael Booker was my 2006–10 teaching assistant and helped with the details and revisions of this project, as did Krystyn Linville, Jenny Salata, and Erika Magnuson, our work study students. Many thanks to Fordham University Press for including this study in its World War II series: Professor Kurt Piehler, series editor; Fred Nachbaur, director of the Press; and Wil Cerbone, editorial associate. My thanks also to the two anonymous readers for their excellent and timely comments and suggestions. A very special thank-you to Michael Koch, outside editor of this book, for his interest, care, and tremendous help in making this a much more readable book, and to Eric Newman. Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank my employer for the past eighteen years, the University of Tennessee, including former Dean Bruce E. Bursten and the College of Arts and Sciences, and former colleagues, Professors James Fitzgerald and Charles Reynolds in the Department of Religious Studies, and Professor J. P.

G. Fischer, Dichtungen, 1841.1\n\nGeographical entities often gain recognition for some unique feature. The district of Göppingen, located in the middle of Baden-Württemberg in the southwestern part of Germany, is known for its connection to the distant past. Hardly a week goes by without a report or article about a new archaeological ﬁnd, be it dinosaur remains, Ice Age fossils, Stone Age artifacts, or Roman relics.2 The geological makeup of the area dates to the Jurassic period, 290 million years ago.3 Deep inside the earth, gneiss and granite still connect this region with the Black Forest in the west and the Bavarian Forest in the east. A massive ocean, followed by a Mars-like atmosphere, gradual decay of the Jura, and tectonic plate movement formed the land with its variation of hills and mountains. Surviving reefs to this day form a “crown” of mighty rocks along the foothills known as the Schwäbische Alb (Swabian Jura).4 Twenty-six million years ago volcanic activity led to higher earth temperatures, generating many thermal springs, and creating carbonic acid which is of great importance to this region, for it, in turn, produces mineral water, which is abundant here.5 Originally used for its therapeutic value in regional spas only, the mineral water from this region is sold worldwide today.6 Minerals also used to play a role in the industry\n\nF5756.indb 1\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\n2 | Introduction\n\nof the area, especially iron. Because of foreign competition, the last iron ore mine, located in Geislingen, closed in 1963. Pebbles, sand, stone, and loam for cement and roof tiles are also big business in the entire region.7 The landscape as it is today evolved during the past 1.8 million years. Warm periods alternated with cold periods, creating Karst, an impressive array of mountains with outcroppings and formations, much like the much larger and world-famous Stone Forest in Shilin, outside of Kunming, in Yunan Province, China.8 The entire region is full of caves, some of considerable size, and it is still possible to ﬁnd a variety of fossils among the rocks. Archaeological evidence of human life in this region dates back to before 10000 BCE. In some of the caves an archaeologist discovered in 1930 ﬂint tools and blades, as well as ﬁreplaces with bones from a variety of animals. Following the end of the last Ice Age about 10000 BCE food sources and ways to procure food changed. So, as a result, did the tools. Microlithes, small geometrical ﬂint artifacts, became the primary hunting tools.9 A great many were located in this area. During the Neolithic period, 4500–2000 BCE, people domesticated animals and planted crops. This necessitated a more sedentary way of life than had been customary until then. With it came technical expertise in construction and handicrafts, requiring new types of tools.10 A stone axe for forestry was found in the district, as were many other tools of the period. The climate of today evolved about 10,000 years ago and, according to archaeologists, the area under discussion was settled about 5,000 years ago (in about 3000 BCE),11 preceding the biblical Abraham by more than a thousand years. Until the Middle Ages, a tribe in the area known as Schwaben (Swabia) enjoyed living in small communities. In the Middle Ages, castles were established as fortiﬁed villages and, over time, mostly walled towns, such as Göppingen in 1098, took the place of castles.12 All the while, village life outside of these walled towns continued unabated, as was the case with the farming villages of Jebenhausen and Süssen (then known as Siezun). According to an 1844 description, the Oberamt (administrative district) of Göppingen reaches from Kirchheim and Esslingen in the west to Schorndorf and Welzheim in the north to Gmünd and Geislingen in the east to Geislingen and Kirchheim in the south. The circumference totals thirty-six to thirty-eight walking hours (or some 112 miles) because of the winding boundary line.13 It is a picturesque, hilly part of Germany, with diversiﬁed forests and numerous buttes—often dotted with charming cas-\n\nF5756.indb 2\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nIntroduction | 3\n\ntles or their remains, vast fruit orchards, and rich ﬁelds. Elevations range from about 1,000 to 1,400 feet above sea level, temperatures average about 48 degrees Fahrenheit, and rainfall is ample at 29.5 inches annually.14 The main river ﬂowing through the valley is the Fils, with the Lauter being a sizeable tributary, especially during the spring snowmelt. The Fils eventually conﬂuences into the Neckar near Plochingen, east of Stuttgart and west of Göppingen. The climate and rich soil are suitable to agriculture and fruit production. Jews have lived in Swabia as far back as the Middle Ages. Swabian cities such as Göppingen, Geislingen, Esslingen, Heilbronn, Reutlingen, Ulm, Augsburg, and others show a Jewish presence that ebbs and ﬂows over time.15 Rural Jewish communities developed primarily when Jews were expelled from cities and settled in nearby villages, thus creating the phenomenon known as Dorfjuden (village Jews).16 Life for Jews in Württemberg was at best unstable over time, and at worst intolerable. Their most powerful enemies were not noblemen, but the guilds of artisans established in the Middle Ages who would not tolerate Jews sharing the same living space with them. “Until 1806 the statutes of the Württemberg guilds arose from two leading thoughts . . . a) the attempted expulsion of the Jews from the Land, and b) the effort to restrict and complicate Jewish trade and life as much as possible, especially through tributes and taxes.”17 This basically meant that the only professions open to village Jews outside the Jewish community were money lending and the much despised peddling. The cattle trade was just barely more respectable than peddling, an important distinction because it was not outlawed in 1828, unlike peddling. Initially Jews were not allowed to deal in new wares; they had to restrict their business dealings to second-hand commodities. Peddlers traveled from Sunday till Friday, loaded down like pack horses with wares, sometimes accompanied by a helper, and they covered a large territory each week. The permanent exhibition catalog in Buttenhausen states, “Peddling is one of the most painstaking ways to make a living, the peddling Jew has to be on the road in all kinds of weather. . . . What he doesn’t have to suffer in the inns! He has terrible worries. Out of prejudice, his [Christian] compatriot, who isn’t wealthy, hardly ever buys from a Jew, he takes his cash to a Christian dealer. When his wallet is empty, then he goes to the Jewish dealer, and why? Because a Christian person won’t lend him any money.”18 Likewise, the director of the Göppingen City Archive, Karl-Heinz Ruess, writes in Spuren schreiben Vergangenheit, “When the Jews did not deal with cattle, they peddled.” They traveled with a carrier\n\nF5756.indb 3\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\n4 | Introduction\n\nor “with a burlap sack on their back through the surrounding villages and towns, went from house to house and offered to farmers and Bürger (citizens) ﬁne cloth, cotton and linen materials, ribbons and borders, leather, skins, bed stuffs, watches, and all kinds of second-hand goods.”19 The ethnographer and philosopher Friedrich Georg Friedmann reports, “One of my great-grandfathers traveled from fair to fair with a heavy sack on his back. Someone told me how the children made fun of him because he was a Jew.”20 As many farms were quite isolated, the weekly visits from the peddler not only served to provide needed goods for the housewife but they also doubled as a news source for the family. During the years of the Black Death pandemic (1348–49), illness and persecution further reduced the Jewish presence in Swabia. In their book, Jüdisches Leben im Wandel der Zeit, Paul Sauer and Sonja Hosseinzadeh note that “already in the ﬁrst half of the fourteenth century there was a small Jewish community in Stuttgart, which suffered terribly during the gruesome plague, the Black Death, in 1348/49, but was apparently not totally destroyed.”21 Karl-Heinz Burmeister notes that the available lists of Württemberg residences show that at the time of the plague “all Jewish communities across Württemberg were affected,” that the area was “blanketed” with pogroms against the Jews living in Württemberg.22 The Deutzer Memorbuch (book of remembrance; Deutz is a place near Cologne) contains a long litany of kehillot, or Jewish communities, that bewail the death of members, including ﬁfty such communities in Medinat Schwaben, among them also Göppingen and Geislingen.23 Other city names in this book that will reappear in the twentieth century are Ulm, Esslingen, Heilbronn, Stuttgart, Bad Cannstatt (today a suburb of Stuttgart), and Reutlingen.24 Helmut Walser Smith argues that much of German behavior during and after the Holocaust was not new but recurring behavior that dates back to the Middle Ages. Upon their expulsion, Jewish property was appropriated and transformed for German religious and secular use.25 Life in the countryside became a viable alternative to city life, especially in light of the fact that expulsion from cities could and did happen at any time. Arguably, from the time of the Black Death in 1348 on, Altwürttemberg was even less hospitable to Jews than it had been before.26 Until 1360, all Jews who lived in the Grafschaft Wirtemberg were Kammerknechte (pages) of the emperor, whose property they were to keep, sell, or gift.27 “On September 15, 1360, Kaiser Karl IV bestowed on the two coregents Count Eberhard II (der Greiner) and Ulrich IV among other privileges also the right to engage Schutzjuden.”28 From the information\n\nF5756.indb 4\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\nIntroduction | 5\n\ntransmitted, Jews settled in Stuttgart in 1434, 1441, 1443, 1459, and in Göppingen in 1462.29 They had rights and privileges and were allowed to live wherever they wanted. Sauer and Hosseinzadeh write, “Between 1393 and 1488 Jews again lived in Stuttgart under favorable conditions. The center of the small kehillah with synagogue and mikvah was in the Brennerstrasse, also called Judengasse.”30 This state of bliss did not last, however. During his rule, Eberhard I (1445–96)—also known as Eberhard im Bart (Eberhard the Bearded)—added a clause to his will that Jews should be expelled from his territory.31 This statute, while taking effect upon his death on February 24, 1496, did not seem to have been strictly enforced because Jews continued to do business in the region, even if they could not live there.32 Besides, not all subsequent rulers felt the same way about Jews as the anti-Jewish Eberhard; some aristocrats were eager to take advantage of Jewish expertise in business matters. Historians Sauer and Hosseinzadeh note that the dukes of Württemberg could not manage without Jewish ﬁnanciers and merchants.33 A Jewish presence was restored to parts of the region at the time of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) when Jewish money was needed either to arm for battle or to recover from battle. But these relaxations of statutes continued to be uneven, as in 1621, when a Württemberg statute declared that “Jews are allowed to buy and sell only at fairs and only for cash.”34 It was thus understood (by some) that Jews were not to settle in Württemberg but would merely pass through on their way to some other destination. “Jews must buy safe passage at the border from the ﬁrst mayor or ofﬁcial [they encounter], either in the form of a letter [of safe passage] or in the form of Leibzoll [body tax], depending on their wealth.”35 In 1710 Duke Eberhard Ludwig of Württemberg allowed the ﬁrst Hoffaktor (court Jew) to settle in Stuttgart, adding four more by 1712; by 1721 seven Jews were living at the court in Stuttgart.36 “The citizenry of Stuttgart treated the privileged court Jews with hostility. The merchant guild especially saw them as life-threatening competition. This upset the duke. He threatened those who harangued, insulted, or even physically attacked the Jews who enjoyed his special protection with severe punishment.”37 The most famous of these early privileged Jews at the court of Württemberg was Süss Oppenheimer, or Jud Süss as he was known, whose ascendancy as Carl Alexander’s court Jew caused such envy that the Stuttgart citizenry hanged him for all the misdeeds of his lord upon the latter’s sudden death. His body was left hanging in a gibbet suspended in midair, where the birds tore off his ﬂesh bit by bit.38 These continuing\n\nF5756.indb 5\n\n4/30/12 7:49:33 AM\n\n6 | Introduction\n\ntensions led to another law, passed in April 1739, that expelled within six months all Jews who had been permitted to settle in villages or towns that were incorporated into the Duchy of Württemberg—and thus did not belong to the Reich (empire).39 Those in power must have been torn between their dislike of Jews and their greed to beneﬁt from the Jewish presence. Jews were subject to a variety of taxes that they had to pay to the local lord as well as to the emperor. There was a body tax, a head tax, a tax for birth, a tax for death, a tax for pursuing a profession or trade, a tax for passing from one territory to another (different for Jews travelling on foot than for Jews travelling on horseback), a tax on livestock, and a tax to maintain wells and paths and bridges.40 In 1753 a Jew paid a fee of three kreuzer to travel two meilen (about nine miles), for a longer stretch it cost thirty kreuzer. For the transport of a body the fee was a hefty two ﬂorin.41 In 1764 there were some Jews living in Württemberg territory whose Schutzgeld (protective tariff) was doubled.42 In 1768 it was necessary for a Jew to possess at least ﬁve hundred to six hundred ﬂorin in order to qualify for protection.43 Taxes also came in the form of tributes. In Freudental, Jewish residents were expected to deliver livestock, feathers, and “a sugar cone for the Gnädige Frau (lady of the lord) for New Year’s . . . made of the ﬁnest Canari sugar,”44 no less, and, of course, the customary holiday geese to the dignitaries of a town for Martini, or Martinmas, on November 11—in the case of Ichenhausen the tribute was twenty-four geese per family.45 Geese were also the tribute in Rexingen and in Baisingen.46 Starting in the second half of the eighteenth century, Jewish families were welcome in two types of habitations in Swabia: those under the direct rule of the emperor and those owned by imperial knights.47 Imperial or “free” cities were reichsunmittelbar, meaning directly under the jurisdiction of the emperor or his representative, the Reichsritter (imperial knights, local nobility).48 While any walled habitation was automatically a city, not all cities were under the jurisdiction of the emperor. Reichsritter lived in Schlösser (castles) that were not necessarily in walled cities. A case in point is Baron of Liebenstein who lived in a castle in Jebenhausen. When the danger of war lurked—which was often—the baron and his family moved to safety within the city walls of neighboring Göppingen. But Göppingen, in spite of its proximity to Mount Hohenstaufen (former home of Emperor Barbarossa in the Middle Ages), was no longer an imperial city; it now belonged to Württemberg. Hence no Jews were allowed to live in Göppingen until 1806, but they were allowed to live in the neighboring village of Jebenhausen, only two kilometers to the south. In 1777\n\nF5756.indb 6\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nIntroduction | 7\n\nthe Liebensteins granted Schutz (protection) to twenty Jewish families. In this time period, Jewish communities were similarly established in Buttenhausen (1787 with twenty-ﬁve families), Laupheim, Rexingen, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and other places. These habitations often had rural character, and Jews lived and worked side by side with local Christian artisans, merchants, storekeepers, and farmers—though never as farmers, since they were not allowed to own farmland. Up to 1806, the conditions of Schutzjuden varied drastically depending on the perception of a given lord concerning the function of Jews in his territory. Still governed by medieval statutes, the number of Jews receiving protection was usually limited. As a rule, only one son per family was allowed to remain, get married, and establish a household in a particular community. The other children of a family had to move away. Where did they go? Members from any given family could be found far distances from home, though usually within the territory of Schwaben or among the extended territories settled by the tribe—unless they emigrated to faraway lands, mostly the United States. Albert Einstein’s family may serve as just one example. The family originated in Bad Buchau am Federsee, one of the great rural Jewish communities of the nineteenth century. His great-greatgrandfather lived and is buried in Laupheim, his maternal grandparents, Julius Koch and wife, lived in Jebenhausen, about sixty miles west of Buchau, where his mother, Pauline Koch, was also born. Einstein, however, was born in Ulm, twenty-two miles east of Jebenhausen, and lived the latter part of his life in the United States. His father later moved to Munich in Bavaria and from there to Italy, where he died. Each of these localities has evidence of an Einstein presence, either in the form of real estate or tombstones. Although there were no shtetls in southern Germany patterned on those in Eastern Europe, this did not mean that Jews were allowed to live wherever they wanted to. They could only settle in certain locations in a village or town, often in a section entirely separate from Christian residents. These areas were known as the Judengasse, Judenviertel, Judenhof, or by some other name identifying the residents as Jews (examples are Jebenhausen, Ichenhausen, Laupheim, Schwäbisch Gmünd). In Ichenhausen, for example, Jews were not allowed “to live within the three gates of the town square.”49 Jews usually were not allowed to buy houses from Christians (see Buttenhausen in 1788) either, but were assigned to houses that were speciﬁcally built for them by their benefactor (for example, Freudental, Ichenhausen, Laupheim, Baisingen). If a Christian house came into Jewish possession as part of a business deal, the house had to be resold\n\nF5756.indb 7\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n8 | Introduction\n\nto a Christian buyer within a certain period of time. Still, in 1797 Duke Friedrich II had to retract a promise he made to his court Jew, Jakob Raphael Kaulla of Hechingen. That year the duke had granted banker Kaulla and his family the right to reside in Stuttgart. But the citizens of Stuttgart complained bitterly, forcing the duke to reconsider. He changed his mind a few months later, although he was convinced of the “total invalidity and nullity of the raised objections.” He voiced his regret at losing the beneﬁts of “considerable ﬁnancial transactions,” which would have come from the far-ﬂung business ventures of Madame Kaille Kaula, the banker’s sister, and one of the most powerful Jewish women ever,50 an equal to the famous Glückel of Hameln in the seventeenth century. Madame Kaula, though doing the duke’s bidding, preferred to retain her residence in her Prussian home city of Hechingen, where she is buried. When the Holy Roman Empire, which had been in existence since 800 CE, came to a formal end in 1806, the territory of Schwaben was divided between the duchies of Bavaria and Württemberg. Both duchies were also elevated to kingdoms by Napoleon, in gratitude for their services to the emperor. In 1800 only 534 Jews were recorded as living in the territory of Altwürttemberg.51 In 1801, 58 of these lived in Stuttgart,52 mostly as tenants. The Peace of Pressburg in 1805 expanded Württemberg’s territories, so that by 1810 the total population of what was now known as Neuwürttemberg had jumped from 650,000 in the dukedom to 1,400,000 in the kingdom.53 This brought the Jews in the western area of Swabia (stretching from Ulm to Breisach in the Black Forest54), who had formerly been under the protection of the Reich or local nobility, under the jurisdiction of the King of Württemberg, making them Landesunterthanen (subjects).55 The new structure also permitted Jewish immigration to all parts of the kingdom, albeit only to existing Jewish communities. Jews also endeavored to become Bürger, or citizens, of a given village, small town, or city. Acquiring Beisitzerrecht (resident status) or Bürgerrecht (citizen status) was crucial for carrying on business or taking part in the civic life of a town. Since there was no uniﬁed Germany until 1871, this did not yet mean that Jews were German citizens. But since the Reichsritterschaft (imperial nobility) had also come to an end, it did mean that they ceased to be Schutzjuden. Although merely Untertanen (tolerated subjects) and as such constrained by many rules and regulations in the Kingdom of Württemberg, some relief from restrictions and oppressive taxation began in 1806 with Elector Friedrich II’s abolition of the guilds as an antiquated institution. This ruling also abolished the Ausschliessungsgesetz der Juden (exclusion-\n\nF5756.indb 8\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nIntroduction | 9\n\nary law for Jews) without, however, providing an alternative legal basis for citizenship. As their Schutzbriefe became invalid, the new conditions still had to be worked out.56 The elector lost no time in doing so, and on June 4, 1808, the Oberlandesregierung (main provincial government) presented a draft of a new statute, Ordnung für die Juden in den Königlichen Staaten (Ordinance for Jews in the Royal States), which was, however, not acceptable to the king.57 Between 1806 and 1828, a number of individual statutes were established in Württemberg, even though no uniform law for Jewish residents was produced.58 For instance, in 1807 the Leibzoll (body tax) and Geleitgeld (tax for safe passage) for Jews at the borders to and from Württemberg were abolished. Jews were allowed to acquire land for agriculture,59 and in 1809 the guilds that didn’t give up easily relaxed their restrictions and allowed Jews to participate in some professions that had until then been restricted for Jews.60 In 1811 Jewish integration was advanced even further, as they were allowed to acquire real estate.61 Special tariffs and gifts to lords were abolished in 1812 and privileges connected to the right of residence were bestowed along with the residency tax.62 In 1815 the Schutzgeld for Jebenhausen Jews, for example, was reduced from twelve to four ﬂorin.63 The king passed a series of statutes for the cultural amelioration and integration of Jews into the existing society. A further push for a uniform Judengesetz came with the coronation of King Wilhelm I on October 30, 1816, following the Congress of Vienna (1815).64 However, one step forward often meant two steps backwards. While the abolition of taxes and work-related restrictions after 1806 were a welcome step forward, not all was well. On September 25, 1819, Württemberg received a new constitution and became a constitutional monarchy.65 This system of governance gave the Jews religious freedom, but not civil rights. Only those citizens belonging to the three recognized Christian denominations—Lutheran, Reformed, and Roman Catholic—had full civil rights. However, this law did give Jews the right to attend university.66 Simultaneously, demands could be heard from the population that Jews should be isolated from the general population in special colonies or reservations, an idea reminiscent of the medieval ghettoization in Frankfurt and other cities and the later ghettoization connected to the Final Solution.67 Statutes in 1825 such as obligatory school attendance for Jewish children foreshadowed things to come,68 as both Jewish trade permits were restricted to a particular district and peddling licenses were painstakingly monitored.69 These restrictions cast a long shadow and were turned into law by the fateful Israelitengesetz\n\nF5756.indb 9\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n10 | Introduction\n\n(Jewish law), also called the Erziehungsgesetz (education law), of April 25, 1928, which regulated the ways in which Jews were permitted to make a living.70 In spite of these drawbacks, for Jews these statutes were mostly steps in the right direction. As Jacob Katz writes in Out of the Ghetto, “In Germany the struggle for emancipation was focused ﬁrst on the legislative bodies of the respective states—the Landtage and senates of the independent towns. Important improvement in their legal status was achieved by the Jews of . . . Württemberg in . . . 1828. . . . Free choice of occupation and right of residence were obtained.”71 Given the documented difﬁculty for Jews to eke out a living during the nineteenth century in places like Jebenhausen, it seems ironic that Württemberg is held up as an example. It does, however, speak well for the enterprising spirit and the persistence of the Jewish community there. At the height of rural Jewish life between 1806 and 1864, Württemberg was saturated with rural Jewish communities, a result of immigration as well as territorial expansion. In 1828 a total of 9,991 Jews lived in eighty towns and villages.72 Sixty-nine of the communities73 had a kehillah that functioned according to age-old tried-and-true methods of autonomous administration. Rabbi Aron Tänzer of Göppingen wrote, “In these 69 communities one could ﬁnd 57 synagogues, 51 rabbis, 67 cantors, 22 teachers, 23 cemeteries, 20,407 ﬂorin in endowments and 24,145 ﬂorin in communal debt.”74 Stefan Rohrbacher puts the ﬁgure in 1832 at 93 percent of Jews living in approximately sixty rural villages.75 The Israelitengesetz not only gave new opportunities to Württemberg Jews, it also took away existing opportunities. It forbade Jews to peddle on danger of losing their Bürgerrecht (status as citizens). Thus the government restricted the issuance of licenses and the sphere of trade, strictly supervising all business transactions, and imposing legal disabilities on trade with Christians.76 Jews were to learn a “bürgerlich [bourgeois] occupation.”77 But Christian guilds, despite their abolition in 1806, continued to make it difﬁcult for Jews to enter the professions. Apprenticing an observant Jew to a Christian master was also a problem because of the dietary laws and Sabbath observance, so that the new law was a curse. With few alternative employment opportunities available, the law caused untold hardships for families and encouraged large-scale emigration to the United States before 1848 and to German cities in the second half of the nineteenth century. Professions that were needed in the Jewish community, such as butcher, baker, tailor, and shoemaker, had of course not been subject to Christian guilds all along. But the government did not count these indi-\n\nF5756.indb 10\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nIntroduction | 11\n\nviduals in their statistics, as these bourgeois professions were not newly adopted, hence did not reﬂect “a change of heart.” Since Jews had never been allowed to own farmland, agrarian professions such as farming were brand-new. Cattle dealing was the major profession among rural Jews and as such was not prohibited. However, Viehverstellen, or boarding of cattle with a farmer for a period of time to fatten them up, was prohibited, even though it went hand in hand with cattle dealing. Likewise, foreign Jews were a thorn in the side of the watchdogs, because they not only came to cattle fairs but also did business at other times. This practice was considered peddling, forbidden from 1828 on.78 Jews were also obligated to adopt surnames, as had become the norm among Germans.79 Although Rabbi Tänzer wrote that there was much good in the new law, the new regulations also seem to have complicated Jewish life, even while setting it on the road to emancipation. Emancipation in German lands occurred gradually from the time of Napoleon, in ﬁts and starts, beginning in 1806 in Northern Germany and concluding in Württemberg on August 13, 1864, Bavaria in 1869, and in all of Germany in 1871. Internal changes occurred alongside the external ones. Rabbi Tänzer considered the formation of a “Jewish Synod” of Württemberg as one of the most valuable and empowering outcomes of the Law of 1828.80 As part of the new status of Jews as religious “equals” to Christians, the structure for Jews as members of a religious body was modeled on that of the other publicly recognized confessions. On January 5, 1832,81 this umbrella organization, known as the Israelitische Oberkirchenbehörde (Jewish Religious Authority) became the spokes organ for all Jewish communities in relation to the state, and thereby disempowered individual communities at the state level.82 The choice of name for the umbrella organization was not an entirely fortunate one. The authorities might have found a more neutral term, as the word Kirche (church) is identiﬁed with Christianity. This is especially true since the organization dealt with matters of civic administration as well as religious matters.83 In order to become a real part of the state bureaucracy, the Jewish community of Württemberg established the Israelitische Zentralkirchenkasse (Central Treasury of the Jewish Religious Authority) to which Württemberg Jews paid a church tax, six ﬂorin for a self-supporting male and three ﬂorin for a self-supporting widow.84 The tax was unpopular and was discontinued in 1873,85 to be replaced by the similarly unpopular, but commonly accepted, system of tithing.86 In 1832 Jewish communities were reorganized according to economic viability. They were also provided with an organizational structure. The\n\nF5756.indb 11\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n12 | Introduction\n\nnew system called for Kirchengemeinden (religious communities) and Rabbinate (Rabbinic districts).87 After reorganization, instead of sixty-nine communities there were now forty-one, which were assigned to thirteen Rabbinic districts.88 Tänzer stresses that the purpose of the religious communities was the common worship of God and that these communities were religious congregations with no separate corporate standing (such as the old Jewish communities had).89 All Jews in Württemberg were compelled to belong to a Jewish community. In this context, modernization of religious practice and Jewish education was instituted by the state as well. One of the most important tasks of the Israelitengesetz was the Hebung (cultural elevation) of Württemberg Jews. This affected every walk of life, from rabbis and cantors to peddlers, farmers, artisans, and merchants. Starting in 1834 the Jewish Religious Authority was obliged by the state to ensure that all rabbis, cantors and teachers, who were now state employees,90 took two civil service examinations. The rabbis were also to prove that they were citizens or residents of the town in which they lived. It appears from Rabbi Tänzer’s account that only six of the previous rabbis were retained, implying that forty-ﬁve (of the ﬁfty-one) old-time rabbis were deposed. Apparently none of the cantors made the cut, which created an additional employment problem—what to do with rabbis and cantors who could no longer earn their keep? The Jewish community collectively was responsible for servicing the indigent, so these poor souls, who were often older, became a burden on the community. The government recognized this and gave the Central Treasury of the Jewish Religious Authority an annual state subvention of 1,500 ﬂorin for 1836–39, “for the support of the old rabbis and cantors who lost their livelihood due to no fault of their own.”91 The government also regulated synagogue worship. A synagogue order of service was instituted for the purpose of decorum, a prayer for the monarch became obligatory, and sermons in German, an organ, and a mixed choir in progressive synagogues, as well as other innovations were instituted. A prayer book, composed and compiled by Rabbi Maier of Stuttgart and published in 1836, became mandatory for all Jewish worship services in the Kingdom of Württemberg, but did not prove popular.92 Rabbis also had to wear a robe similar to that of Christian clergy.93 “Israelite” schools seem to have been particularly well positioned to make the transition to the reorganization with minor difﬁculties, which of course speaks well for the Jewish system of education. As David Sor-\n\nF5756.indb 12\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nIntroduction | 13\n\nkin writes in The Transformation of German Jewry 1780–1840, in 1829 all eleven of these schools transitioned to state-funded elementary schools without any difﬁculty whatsoever.94 From 1836 on, Jewish Volksschulen (elementary schools) with more than sixty families were funded by the local municipality and no longer by the Jewish community.95 These schools were located in Aufhausen, Buchau, Buttenhausen, Crailsheim, Freudental, Jebenhausen, Mühringen, Nordstetten, Oberdorf, and Rexingen.96 Rabbi Tänzer lists the subjects taught in Jebenhausen. The German teacher was responsible for biblical history, German reading and language, mental and written arithmetic, German spelling and calligraphy, and German singing.97 The Jewish teacher was in charge of Hebrew language, religion, and Hebrew calligraphy.98 Other educational opportunities for Jewish children were the voluntary Jewish religious schools, whose only difference from the Jewish elementary schools was that their establishment did not require a minimum of sixty families and was funded by the Jewish community, similar to the Jewish day schools in the United States today.99 The curriculum was identical to that in public schools. If there was neither a Jewish elementary school nor a voluntary Jewish Religious school, Jewish pupils had to attend the allgemeine Ortsschule (local elementary school) with Jewish religious instruction paralleling that of their Christian classmates. Although they had to attend school on the Sabbath, accommodations were made for pupils not to take tests or write on that day and to attend worship services if possible.100 The administration of the Jewish pupils was the responsibility of the Oberschulbehörde (Christian State School Board), not the Jewish Religious Authority. A local pastor or priest was charged with the immediate supervision of any instruction of Jewish children. Did the Israelitengesetz of 1828 make a difference? According to government statistics, in 1828, out of 3,041 Jewish males over the age of fourteen, 2,600 were peddlers, none were scholars or artists (by German standards; they were of course by Jewish standards), 32 were farmers or helpers, and 409 were artisans or apprentices. Twenty-four years later, the picture looked quite different. Out of 3,930 Jewish males over fourteen, only 695 were peddlers, a drop of 75 percent; 214 were scholars and artists (acceptable by German standards), 405 were farmers, and the biggest jump was among the artisans and merchants, namely 2,526, a six-fold increase.101 Although some Jewish traditions were regrettably lost during this period of reorganization, the danger of drastic change was greater in cities than in rural communities. Jewish village life as a rule was more conserva-\n\nF5756.indb 13\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n14 | Introduction\n\ntive and traditional. Older community members enjoined their children to adhere closely to tradition. One father, in his ethical will, admonished his sons “never to shave with a razor blade.”102 For the most part, while the children of this generation remained in the village they obeyed the religious laws, but when they moved or were forced to move either to cities or abroad, they often adjusted their ways to those of the new environment. Since these rural communities were farther removed from the watchful eyes of the authorities, local leaders sometimes ignored the orders for change and kept to the old ways. Nachum Gidal writes, “While in the 18th and 19th centuries Jewish society in the large cities was riven by the differences between the orthodox, liberals, and extreme reformists, and also by the gulf between rich and poor, the communities in villages and small towns remained homogeneous.”103 Being Jewish in German lands had been a challenge since the Middle Ages. After Emancipation in 1871, however, there was much optimism and hope for a better future. Then, some sixty years later, the perpetrators of the Holocaust came to power. One would think that none of the survivors would ever want to return to a place where friends and neighbors caused them so much pain. However, as this study demonstrates, one should never underestimate the pull of home, even if, as historians Jack Kugelmass and Jonathan Boyarin as well as Omer Bartov document, the beautiful gardens of the survivors’ youth continue to exist only in their memories.104 Chapter 1 tells the remarkable tale of a mayor, Martin Bauch, reaching out to a survivor, Hugo Lang, in an attempt to reconcile victims and perpetrators in 1989. Chapter 2 focuses on the village of Süssen, which was home to two Jewish families from 1902 until they were expelled by the Nazis. The chapter also touches on some of Süssen’s history—including its military history and the presence of Napoleon, the devastation from war, the suffering caused by famine, and the ravages of epidemics such as the plague—in an attempt to illuminate some of the town’s collective past. Chapter 3 introduces the Ottenheimer family who in 1902 branched out from their hometown of Göppingen and were welcomed in Klein-Süssen. The chapter discusses the family’s contributions to village life, their business successes and challenges, and their eventual loss of property due to Aryanization as well as the resultant personal tragedy of the Ottenheimer families. Chapter 4 introduces Jakob Lang, the patriarch of a successful extended family in Süssen, and tells the story of his half-brothers, Louis and Leopold, and their families until the time when the Nazi laws began\n\nF5756.indb 14\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nIntroduction | 15\n\nto impinge on their daily lives in 1937. Chapter 5 documents the grisly details of the Nazis’ ever tightening noose around the Langs’ necks—the loss of their livelihood, their arrest and imprisonment in the Dachau concentration camp, and the loss of their home and property in 1939. Chapter 6 covers Hugo Lang’s departure from Süssen, only three months before the rest of his family was deported “to the East,” and his adventures and new life in the United States. Chapter 7 describes the tragedy of the Lang family’s deportation. Chapter 8 grapples with the Lang cousins’ liberation and return from the concentration camps and their struggle to reclaim their belongings, illuminating the continuous wrangling among the German authorities over the ﬁnancial responsibility for compensation of the victims. Chapter 9 delves into the bewildering maze of bureaucratic hassles that surrounded the Langs’ reparations proceedings—a messy tale of compensation for real estate and other losses, such as liberty, education, and good will. Chapter 10 focuses on the history of the Jewish communities in Jebenhausen and Göppingen, to which the two principal Jewish families discussed in this book belonged. Chapter 11 summarizes the history of the little known satellite Jewish community in Kirchheim unter Teck for those who do not have access to the German publications. Chapter 12 describes some of the darker history of picturesque Geislingen, including its concentration camp and the local Finanzamt (tax ofﬁce) to which Süssen paid its taxes. This book is an essential chapter in the history of the town of Süssen. It is also a chapter in the history of the city of Göppingen, because the Süssen Jews belonged to the Göppingen Jewish community. It is furthermore a contribution to our understanding of World War II, Holocaust studies, and the scholarship of Landjudentum (rural Jewry), a category of scholarship that has taken root primarily in Germany, and primarily as a consequence of the Holocaust, in an effort to document some of the hundreds of rural Jewish communities that have been lost forever.105 This book is also an important chapter in the personal history of two Jewish families—the Langs and the Ottenheimers—who lived and worked in Süssen for nearly forty years. Laura Levitt, in her book, American Jewish Loss After the Holocaust, pleads for our appreciation of “ordinary legacies” of ordinary Jewish families.106 The Langs once led such ordinary lives, as Hugo Lang’s family photo album shows. Last but hardly least, this study concludes a chapter in my own life, for once upon a time Süssen was my hometown as well. But that story will have to wait for another time.\n\nF5756.indb 15\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n1\n\nPost-Nazi Süssen: An Attempt at Reconciliation\n\nWe mourn, but we live in hope of reconciliation among the people and peoples of the world and in hope of peace. —Mayor Martin Bauch, SPD, Volkstrauertag, November 13, 1988\n\nIn 1981 the picturesque town of Süssen, located within view of the famous butte that once was the home of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa (1123–90) and the Hohenstaufen monarchy, began dealing with its past by unveiling a bronze fountain in the market square that depicts ﬁfteen highlights from the town’s history—from its ﬁrst mention in 1071 to 1981.1 The fountain was designed by Black Forest artist Jo Homolka (born in Stuttgart in 1925) and cast in bronze by the local ﬁrm of Strassacker, the same company that in 1938 had cast a giant wreath with a swastika for the Parteitag in Nuremberg. One of the scenes on the historical fountain depicts the deportation of the Jews of Süssen.2 In 1983, on the occasion of the ﬁftieth anniversary of the uniﬁcation—under Nazi pressure—of then Gross-Süssen (Greater Süssen) and Klein-Süssen (Smaller Süssen) into one settlement, the local Volkshochschule researched and published its ﬁrst attempt at local Nazi history, entitled, 50 Years of Süssen.3 Somewhat ﬂawed—with omissions and errors because the town’s history had not yet been thoroughly researched—the publication presented a sanitized version of historical events, but nevertheless contained the ﬁrst evidence of the Nazi-inspired persecution of the Jews of Süssen, including the deportation records. In a special feature, “50 Jahre Gemeinde Süssen,” the regional newspaper, the Neue Württembergische Zeitung, also reported on the fate of the Jews.4 However, it was not until 1988 that the town’s ofﬁcials were ready to engage with the survivors of the Nazi atrocities. In 1988 Ruth Lang Lemberger wrote to the city hall in Süssen in an attempt to obtain a birth certiﬁcate. She was then sixty-three years old and was probably getting ready to apply for Social Security in the United States which requires applicants to provide a birth certiﬁcate. On Octo-\n\nF5756.indb 16\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nPost-Nazi Süssen | 17\n\nber 31, 1988, then Mayor Martin Bauch responded to Ruth in an effort to establish contact “similar to that already underway in other cities and communities of the Federal Republic in order to prepare a meeting in Süssen.” He noted that in 1983 Süssen had opened its archives so that the citizens could learn about the events of the Holocaust, adding an ofﬁcial apology for the wrongs perpetrated on Ruth and her family and informing her of the naming of a lane in memory of the Lang family who used to call Süssen their home. He also requested the addresses of other members of the extended Lang family who were deported in 1941. Ruth must not have responded to his request, because on November 18, 1988, Mayor Bauch wrote to Ruth again, asking her to share her story with him. “We younger people have to rely on eye witnesses and victims to help us with remembering and to serve as a warning.” This was clearly an appeal to her on the grounds that he was too young to have been a Nazi. To my knowledge, Ruth did not share her story with the mayor. Mayor Bauch also sent her a program from the Volkstrauertag (National Memorial Day) on November 13, 1988, and a transcript of his speech for the occasion.5 In his speech, Mayor Bauch minced no words: “Auschwitz remains unique. It was carried out by Germans in the name of Germany. This truth is irrevocable. And we will not forget.”6 He then mentioned Louis and Leopold Lang, who had served and had been decorated for their service in World War I. “That the gratitude of the fatherland drove those who returned into exile, deported them, and subjected all too many of them to the National Socialist concentration camps, will forever be one of the most shameful and depressing chapters of German history.”7 On May 12, 1989, Mayor Bauch sent a letter to the former Jewish citizens of Süssen inviting them to a weeklong visit in the town they had to leave “during the years of persecution.” Based on the responses, invitations were extended to Hugo Lang and Ruth Lemberger, and their cousins Siegfried, Kurt, and Henny Lang. The letter stressed that “the town of Süssen has changed considerably in recent decades; some of the things that used to be familiar no longer exist or have been redesigned.” The town also offered the visitors kosher meals if desired. They also were allowed to bring a signiﬁcant other to the all-expenses paid reunion. A registration form was enclosed.8 On May 30, 1989, Ruth’s brother, Hugo Lang, former Jewish citizen of Süssen, and his wife of forty-one years, Inge, living in New Jersey, replied to the invitation. “We both accept the invitation and will leave from JFK in New York on October 1.”9\n\nF5756.indb 17\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n18 | Post-Nazi Süssen\n\nOn the morning of October 2, Hugo and Inge arrived in Süssen, accompanied by their daughter Evelyn and her husband Anthony Donofrio as well as Hugo and Inge’s son, Ken, and his wife, Maria, and two grandchildren, Victoria, age ﬁve, and Kendra, one and a half years old. Manfred Lang’s widow, Rose, and her son from her (Rose’s) ﬁrst marriage, Michael Fabian, also joined them. The city arranged for them to stay at the Hotel Löwen. The ofﬁcial program commenced that afternoon with a welcoming session in the city hall to which all city council members were invited. All of the painful memories were temporarily suppressed when Hugo Lang thanked the city for the invitation, including his old friend, “former Deputy Mayor Häfele,”10 and stating that he was proud to be able to show his wife and children his “old home in Württemberg.” He noted that “fortyeight years have passed since I left my homeland in 1941, had to leave. . . . Unfortunately, my parents, aunt, uncle, grandparents, sister, and cousins remained behind. None of them could get a visa at the time. You know what happened to my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles—I won’t speak about it. Those who do not know only have to read the memorial plaque in the cemetery. This plaque clearly describes their terrible fate.” Hugo expressed his thanks to the town for erecting “the memorial plaque” in the cemetery and for not allowing the family names of “Lang and Oppenheimer [sic! Ottenheimer]” to be forgotten. “We also appreciate the memorial on the historical fountain, and will not forget these things.” The plaque in the cemetery Hugo was referring to was the war memorial for World War II soldiers, afﬁxed next to the World War I war memorial on the outside wall of the chapel in the Süssen cemetery, Stiegelwiesen. For years I have puzzled over how the names of Holocaust victims could have gotten on the same plaque with their perpetrators. In organizing the Süssen ﬁles in the District Archive in Göppingen, a colleague found an alphabetical listing of “fallen and missing soldiers of the Gemeinde [municipality] Süssen,” which included police ofﬁcer Josef Holl, who accompanied and guarded the Jews of Süssen to the collection camp in Stuttgart, on the same page with his victim, Rudolf Metzger. For Holl it says “missing in action in Poland in January 1945,” and he was subsequently declared dead; for Rudolf Metzger the listing says umgekommen (died), not verstorben (deceased) as for a prisoner-of-war on the same list. In other words, those compiling the list knew the semantic difference between the two terms. Alfred and Hermine Baer, Eva and Leopold Lang, Louis and Fanny Lang, and Alfred and Eugenie Metzger are also on this list.11 Though he did not let on in his public speech during his visit to Süssen, Hugo told me that\n\nF5756.indb 18\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nPost-Nazi Süssen | 19\n\nhe was horriﬁed that his loved ones were intermingled with the dead who had served Hitler and the Nazi state. In his speech, Hugo also noted, “Honestly, all Lang family members were very happy to live in Süssen at that time. My father often said, ‘We will never leave our hometown voluntarily.’ But unfortunately things turned out quite different than my parents had planned.” He then gave those present an update on the relatives who also live in the United States and were not able to be present. “My brother Manfred did very nicely for himself. He had a good job and a beautiful house. Two years ago [1987] he died of cancer.” He also acknowledged that Fred’s widow Rose and her son Michael came to Süssen with them. He continued, “My sister Ruth also would have liked to join us on this trip, but that wasn’t possible this year. She and her husband have a [kosher] butcher shop that they couldn’t close. Maybe in a few years when she is retired.” He then added, “My sister Ruth met her husband in the concentration camp. At that time they promised that if they survived they would keep kosher. This they did. They keep milchig [dairy] and ﬂeischig [meat] separate. They became observant. They survived the camps and promised to go the whole way, not only half.”12 Hugo continued, “My cousin Siegfried lives in Florida. His health is not good. He always had problems with his hip. He was born with one leg shorter than the other. Already then he wore a brace. He was operated on four times, but it didn’t get any better. So he couldn’t come with us.”13 And Hugo’s “cousin Kurt lost his twenty-six-year-old son three months ago, so he couldn’t come for that reason.”14 About his other cousin, Inge Lang, he said that she had died of cancer in 1973. “She was the oldest of the Louis Lang family. And my cousin Henny lives in Florida. She moved there from New York a few years ago. She isn’t well. That’s why she couldn’t come.”15 Hugo then thanked the town for the invitation, and wished everyone continued good fortune “under the excellent leadership of Mayor Bauch.”16 The visitors and the town’s people had to feel each other out. When asked about his ﬁrst contact with the citizens of Süssen, Hugo responded, “The ﬁrst meeting was a little difﬁcult for us, because we didn’t know what might be discussed, what might happen. But that is no longer the case, we now know that the town and the city council, and especially Mayor Bauch, had put a lot of effort into the research. We are convinced that this community will remember the Lang name.”17 On Tuesday, October 3, a reception was held in the city hall, followed by an all-day tour of the town, including their former home. As a boy, Hugo had to help store the produce for the winter in the cellar. He obviously\n\nF5756.indb 19\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n20 | Post-Nazi Süssen\n\nhad fond memories for, after visiting his house, Hugo commented, “The cellar is still the way it was ﬁfty years ago. The stone plates, the steps are the same. I am happy to have seen the cellar again.”18 In the evening there was a get-together with acquaintances from the neighborhood and former classmates of Hugo’s in the Mostkeller (a room named for a cellar where cider is stored) of the Gasthof Löwen. When asked what it felt like to be in the presence of former classmates, Hugo responded, “Honestly, I was a little bit nervous to see people with whom I went to school and whom I no longer recognized. But I had the courage to shake their hand and greet them. Meanwhile we have become more familiar. Many said that they had to join the war effort. They had to join in like all others, I understand that.”19 He was also given a list of classmates who had died during the war or were missing in action. There were thirteen of them—the same number of dead from a whole school class as from one family, the Langs.20 To the question whether this gathering brought back any special memories, Hugo responded, “Yes. Hermann Fischer, a classmate, fought in the same battle in the Ardennes where I was captured. He was a German soldier, I was an American GI. We both were in the same town at the same time, on the same day—December 18, 1944. That was quite a coincidence. That was the high point of the meeting for me. We talked for an hour and parted again as friends.”21 There were no scheduled activities for Wednesday morning, October 4. The afternoon plans included a bus trip to Stuttgart for a meeting with Rabbi Joel Berger, chief rabbi of the state of Baden-Württemberg, and a visit to the Stuttgart synagogue. Rabbi Berger was somewhat anxious about the timing, as the visit coincided with the High Holy Days that year, September 29 to October 9.22 Mr. Kurt Eifert, a retired school principal, served as the Langs’ escort. The evening concluded with a dinner at the kosher Restaurant Shalom in Stuttgart. On Thursday, October 5, the group visited Göppingen, which used to be home to the Jewish community to which the Langs belonged. They visited the site of the destroyed synagogue and the Jewish section of the Göppingen municipal cemetery. Their escorts were Walter Lang (no relation), teacher and district archaeologist, who had to be excused from teaching so he could conduct a tour of Göppingen for the guests.23 Mr. Kurt Eifert also joined them again. The afternoon was set aside for a stroll through Göppingen, and the day concluded with dinner with Mayor Bauch as well as a consultation on the remainder of the stay. No activites were scheduled for Friday, October 6.\n\nF5756.indb 20\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nPost-Nazi Süssen | 21\n\nOn Saturday, October 7, the group traveled to Ulm, 19 miles east of Süssen, for a city excursion and visit to the Ulmer Münster, a beautiful cathedral with its famous “Hebrew” window. Ulm had special meaning for Hugo who had apprenticed as a waiter in the Jewish Restaurant Moos at Weinhof, in the vicinity of the cathedral, before Kristallnacht in 1938. He also has a good and lifelong friend in the United States, Walter Gundel, whom he knows from their Ulm days. The day concluded with a dinner in Süssen, hosted by the municipality, again in the Mostkeller of the Gasthof Löwen, and attended by the mayor and members of the city council as well as Mr. Eifert and wife. Sunday, October 8, was reserved for any desired farewell visits—farewells that were quite different from those of Louis, Leopold, and their relatives in 1941. Some time during the visit, two cookbooks from the Lang kitchen were also returned to Hugo and family.24 Asked how he felt when he received the two cookbooks from Frau R. H., the woman who had held on to them all these years, Hugo responded, “I would have never believed that they still existed. Especially since they were my mother’s, may her memory be for a blessing. I was very pleasantly surprised and would like to thank the woman personally.” According to archival records, Frau H. is the daughter of a couple who acquired the Lang’s kitchen cupboard (presumably at auction after deportation). The cookbooks, which dated back to the time of the kaiser, were inside.25 The mayor noted that the “old kitchen cupboard” was handed down to Frau H.’s daughter and has been refurbished so that it serves as the centerpiece in their household.26 I asked Hugo if he had the cookbooks. Hugo replied that he gave them to his sister, Ruth.27 The visitors departed on Monday, October 9. The town’s October 15 bulletin featured the meeting in the city hall on the front page with the headline, “A group of former Jewish citizens and their families spent last week in Süssen. During the Third Reich some of them were assisted with emigration and were thus spared the horrors of the persecution against the Jews.”28 Those assisted were Fred and Hugo, and their cousins Henny and Inge. Before leaving Hugo offered the town a gift of DM 10,000 for a proper memorial for his murdered family. The town, while declining his money, promised to erect a separate memorial plaque for the victims of the Holocaust. They kept their promise. Less than two years later, Hugo and Inge received an enthusiastic letter from Rolf Karrer, SPD member,29 informing them that he was elected mayor on November 26, 1990, and was ready to\n\nF5756.indb 21\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n22 | Post-Nazi Süssen\n\ntackle the memorial plaque the city had promised.30 He also sent them a proposal for the inscription for the memorial plaque, to which Hugo immediately responded by telephone. From this letter it becomes apparent that the city did not know for sure the names of the Lang family members who were murdered.31According to a letter of July 22, 1991, the city council decided in March to approve the memorial in the cemetery Stiegelwiesen. Mayor Karrer then invited Hugo and Inge to a dedication of the handsome bronze memorial on Tuesday, July 30, 1991, at 5 P.M. in the cemetery Stiegelwiesen, with dinner to follow.32 The plaque, which is placed in front of the burial hall, but at a 45degree angle to the memorial plaque for the war dead, has all the correct information and reads, In memory of our fellow Jews who were deported and murdered during the Nazi reign, as a daily reminder for us, and as an obligation not to tolerate racial hatred and intolerance. 1933–1945–1991.\n\nThose listed are Leopold Lang; Eva Lang, née Liffmann; Louis Lang; Fanny Lang, née Landau; Alfred Baer; Hermine Baer, née Lang; Hans Kurt Baer; Siegfried Baer; Werner Baer; Alfred Metzger; Eugenie Metzger, née Baer; Rudolf Metzger; Falk Sahm, and Walter Zeimann. During this visit, Hugo and Inge’s guide was again District Archaeologist Walter Lang. According to a letter to Hugo and Inge dated September 17, 1991, Mr. Lang at that time also conducted research on the Jews of Göppingen, authoring a publication on Kristallnacht which he sent to the Langs in 1992 along with Inge Auerbacher’s book, I am a Star.33 He was also at that time involved with the Jewish Museum in Jebenhausen, and became the keeper of pictures and mementos that Hugo gave to the town of Süssen. An article on the front page of the Süssener Mitteilungen of August 15, 1991, pointed out that the unveiling of the memorial took place “a few days after the anniversary of the attempt on Hitler’s life [by Count von Stauffenberg on July 20, 1944] in the presence of members of the Jewish family Hugo Lang.” Acting Mayor Karl Müller noted in his remarks that “at that time in Süssen very few people were willing to help the victims, there practically was no resistance.” He, too, noticed the irony of the entry in the city council minutes of 1941 “in the most elegant Sütterlin script” that Süssen was now free of Jews.34\n\nF5756.indb 22\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nPost-Nazi Süssen | 23\n\nIn spite of hopes to visit Süssen in 1992, the occasion of the unveiling of the memorial plaque was Hugo and Inge’s last visit to Süssen, although they regularly have visitors from Süssen in their New Jersey home.35 Both Mr. Bauch and Mr. Karrer stayed in touch with Hugo and Inge. On July 4, 1995, Mayor Karrer wrote to Hugo and Inge informing them that he had met Hilde Schmalz, née Meissnest, a good friend of Hugo’s since childhood, who was about to visit the Langs for six weeks. He was going to send along a booklet that the town had put together in its application for cityhood, asking them for their opinion.36 Two local industrialists likewise visit Hugo and Inge regularly when on a business trip to the United States. Hugo routinely receives the Süssen information bulletin, a gift initiated by Mayor Karrer in 1991,37 which he reads with great interest and sometimes sends on to Knoxville for further perusal. To my knowledge, no such ofﬁcial visit to Süssen has taken place by survivors of the other Jewish family that is part of this study, the Ottenheimers. Since the Ottenheimers were considered primary residents of Göppingen, an invitation may have been extended from the city of Göppingen, which has hosted a number of visiting Holocaust survivors over the years.\n\nF5756.indb 23\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n2\n\nA Village Called Süssen\n\nI wish to rush from my home For it is no longer such! Alien and oppressed I feel here Never again will I return. —Johann Georg Fischer, Dichtungen, 1841.1\n\nAn erstwhile resident of Süssen who reads Johann Georg Fischer’s poem, no matter the reason for his or her leaving, will recognize the sentiment. Although Hugo Lang, who was forced to leave, and I, who chose to leave, have been graciously welcomed back upon our return, the sentiment expressed in Fischer’s poem resonates. For me researching the story of two Jewish families in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century on location was at once satisfying and disturbing. As it happens, both of these Jewish families established contact with their respective parts of Süssen in the same year, 1902. Jakob Lang moved to Gross-Süssen from Göppingen, and Alfred Ottenheimer, also from Göppingen, bought land for a factory in Klein-Süssen. Although a good bit of the history of these two families points to cordial relations with their municipalities, there is also evidence of betrayal. The village of Süssen, with its historic buildings and breathtaking gardens and window boxes, is located in the center of the district of Göppingen, along the old road from Stuttgart (31 miles to the west) to Ulm (24.8 miles to the east), surrounded by spacious ﬁelds and lush orchards. Until 1933, Süssen was split into two parts—Gross-Süssen (Greater Süssen), which was Lutheran, and Klein-Süssen (Smaller Süssen), which was Catholic. The two villages were separated by the river Fils, which ﬂows through the center of town and gives the entire twelve-mile-long valley from Göppingen to Geislingen its name—the Filstal. The valley is framed on both sides by gently rolling hills, which are dotted with picturesque medieval castles such as Staufeneck and Ramsberg in the north. Dominantly\n\nF5756.indb 24\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nA Village Called Süssen | 25\n\nrising in the northwest is the Hohenstaufen, one of three Staufer mountains, erstwhile home of the medieval Emperor Barbarossa.2 At the eastern end, above Geislingen, protrude the ruins of Castle Helfenstein and the Ödenturm. In tax matters, Geislingen remained the center for Süssen even after its rezoning and annexation to the district of Göppingen in 1938. The name Süssen is a modern version of a word that predates the existence of the settlement. Derived from an Old High German word, it means “wooded grazing land” or “wooded grazing land for cattle.” Several formulations of the word are known, including Siezun and the earlier siaza or sioza.3 Walking through this town today, one is struck by the multicultural makeup of the population. A larger percentage of Süssen residents are Muslim than ever were Jewish, and Muslim women live out their religiosity in public by wearing headscarves, though no burkas are in evidence.4 Süssen also has a Muslim Community Center. However, at the concert celebrating Süssen’s tenth anniversary of obtaining the title of town, which was held in the Lutheran church on July 7, 2006, there was no observable Muslim presence. Even so, the city has made tremendous progress. When I was a child, there was little diversity. Back then, the locals received the World War II refugees—Germans from eastern Europe, such as Silesia, Sudeten Territory, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary (Hungarian nationals with German roots called Donauschwaben)—only grudgingly and with resentment because of their material needs at a time when native Süssen citizens themselves experienced a severe shortage of food and jobs.5 Hungarian women back then also wore headscarves, something the local population got accustomed to because the women did not acquiesce to the cultural pressure to assimilate. It nevertheless took a long time for the refugees to be accepted and integrated. Only in 2000 did the town of Süssen formalize its long-time partnership with Törökbalint, a sister city in Hungary. And then there were the Gastarbeiter (guest workers) from Italy, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Spain, who had been invited by the German government to pick up the shortfall in labor following the economic recovery in the 1950s. They did well, and helped the population of small towns like Süssen, and Germany in general, to regain and maintain their high standard of living. But what about the quality of the foreign workers’ cultural lives? Many started families, and their offspring born in Germany were considered German citizens. Yet the parents were not nor, under German law, could they ever become citizens. Had Germany really changed that much\n\nF5756.indb 25\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n26 | A Village Called Süssen\n\nin regards to how it treated foreign-born residents since the Holocaust? The question whether Germany is an Einwanderungsland (immigration country) has been hotly debated for more than thirty years. In spite of all the visible diversity, even in a small town like Süssen, the country continues to ﬁght immigrants instead of embracing them. In 2006 the state of Württemberg introduced a Gesinnungstest, also known as the Muslimtest, to determine whether immigrants are sincere about wanting to integrate into German society.6 This is reminiscent of the Israelitengesetz of 1828 whose purpose it was to integrate Jews into the German artisan class, a move that deprived many of them of their traditional livelihood, yet did not open up new opportunities for them. It seems that every generation has to ﬁght the battle of belonging all over again. A History of Conﬂicts\n\nThe discovery of Merowingian burial grounds near Süssen’s railrod station suggests that people may have settled in the area as early as the seventh or eighth century CE.7 The ﬁrst written evidence of a settlement dates from 10718 in a document of the cloister of Lorsch at Bergstrasse,9 located geographically far from the farm they owned in Süssen. Lorsch was founded in 763 CE,10 well before the start of Charlemagne’s reign in 800 CE. The farm in Süssen was a gift to Lorsch along with other bequests that stretched from the North Sea to Graubünden, Switzerland. A historian of the cloister reported that “members of the Lorsch Abbey could travel from one end of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation to the other without sleeping on foreign soil even for one night!”11 Although Süssen, at ﬁrst, had only one farm to offer, that was important, for it helped to feed the monks of Kloster Altenmünster, a monastery near Lorsch.12 From the ninth century on the population of the region was Christian and relied for religious guidance on the cloister in Adelberg—established in 1178 by Ritter Folknand von Staufen.13 In 1267 Count Ludwig of Spitzenberg-Helfenstein and his son, Eberhard, whose castle was perched on a mountain of the same name above the village of Kuchen, three miles east of Süssen, gifted the church in Süssen with all rights to the Cloister Adelberg “as an indulgence for their and their forebears’ eternal salvation.”14 With the death of Konradin (the last of the famous and powerful Staufen clan) in 1268, their possessions were appropriated and administered primarily by lesser nobility, such as the counts of Spitzenberg, Helfenstein, and Rechberg. In the thirteenth century Süssen seems to have had some\n\nF5756.indb 26\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\nA Village Called Süssen | 27\n\nnobility of its own, probably ofﬁcials of the Count of Spitzenberg. In his book, Von Siezun bis Süssen, Walter Ziegler mentions Gottefrido de Siezon in 1241, Sigfrid in 1290 and 1291, and Knight Eberhard von Süssen, and his son Johann, in 1321, 1331, and 1332.15 It is not known where in the village these noblemen resided; they disappeared from history after 1332. Johann von Süssen’s emblem was the emblem of Gross-Süssen until 1933. The Süssen emblem since 1933 incorporates parts of the former Grossand Klein-Süssen emblems.16 Personal status in the Middle Ages was all about possessions, of both land and people. Everyone—the emperor, the king, the Church, the Pope, and all the dukes and other lesser nobility—vied for bigger and better land holdings. Properties were won, lost, bought, sold, gifted, inherited, and swapped among the nobility, including the residents of these territories. Communities were split up among several different overlords.17 Süssen was no exception and over time became a place of many masters. In 1270 two farms and a farm on loan to the current “owner” were sold by one nobleman to another—actually to a noblewoman.18 Ten years later two more farms were sold to someone else and in 1290 yet another property was sold. The respective properties went to politically competitive owners, the ﬁrst two to the counts of Helfenstein (and in 1396 to the Reichsstadt, or Imperial City, of Ulm), and the second and third properties to the Spital zum Heiligen Geist, a Church-owned hospital, in the Imperial City of Schwäbisch Gmünd. In 1290 the resulting separate ownership of large tracts of property in Süssen split the village in two. For the next 640 years the two settlements developed relatively independently of each other. The part north of the river Fils became known as Minnern Siessen or KleinSüssen, while the part south of the Fils was known as Gross-Süssen.19 What they shared, however, is a wild and unstable history due to robber barons, traveling soldiers to and from military battleﬁelds, ﬁres, natural disasters, religious wars, witch trials, and political upheavals. Two incidents shall serve as an example. Süssen is located on the main thoroughfare from the Rhineland to Bavaria. In 1441, despite the paid armed guard detail that escorted and protected their caravan, a group of merchants returning from a fair in Frankfurt was ambushed and robbed of 40 horses and 5,000 ﬂorin (gulden),20 not to mention the loss of 8 or 9 lives.21 On September 6, 1449, both parts of Süssen and neighboring towns were burned to the ground during the Schwäbische Städtekrieg (Swabian Cities War), a war between the Duchy of Württemberg and the Imperial City of Ulm. Recovery from\n\nF5756.indb 27\n\n4/30/12 7:49:34 AM\n\n28 | A Village Called Süssen\n\nthis devastation was slow, and the peace did not last. The region suffered at least one major war every one hundred years, often more frequently than that. If politics were complicated, so was religion, and the consequences cast a long shadow. In 1493 religious rivalry put Klein-Süssen on the map of the Vatican when their priest decreed that the local church, the Marienkirche, could celebrate high mass and therewith collect the taxes previously due to the neighboring district of Hürbelsbach.22 Klein-Süssen remained Catholic until after World War II. Two years after Martin Luther’s posting of the Ninety-Five Theses on the doors of Wittenberg University in 1517, Lutheran Count Ulrich of Württemberg was ousted and exiled by the Catholic Kaiser. The residents of Gross-Süssen were reformed in 1531 along with all of the subjects of the district of Ulm.23 Yet until 1535, their shepherd was a Catholic priest provided by the Cloister Adelberg. The cloister became one of the casualties of the Reformation, closing its doors in 1535. Many of the indentured servants in Gross-Süssen were former subjects of the monastery who did not necessarily gain their freedom at the time. During the continuing hostilities in the region, the suffering brought on by the indenture of the men affected primarily their wives and children, because the troops destroyed their property and the men weren’t present to defend it. In 1552 this prompted the wives in several villages, among them also Gross-Süssen, to band together and petition Duke Christoph of Württemberg for protection of their property.24 Gross-Süssen remained Lutheran until after World War II. Count Ulrich’s exile was not easily forgotten. Nearly thirty years later, in 1546, the incident led to another religious war, the Schmalkaldische Krieg (Schmalkaldic War).25 Gross-Süssen was initially spared from the hostilities of the Thirty Years’ War,26 which raged in German lands from 1618–48, because the Schwäbische Reichskreis (Swabian Imperial District), which included the imperial city of Ulm and its territories, declared its neutrality.
