        "text": "Reichskommissariat Arthursland (RKA) was established by the German Empire on November 1940. It became the civilian occupation regime in the territory of the Arthurian Empire controlled by Germany. The political organization for this territory – after an initial period of military administration before its establishment – involved a German civilian administration, completely under the a military junta led by its appointed Reichskommissar, Erwin Rommel. After the marriage of Empress Guinevere to Prince Joachim, Wilhelm II's son, the latter was appointed as the ruling monarch of Arthursland, which didn't change much as Joachim chose to live in the city of Guinevere with his wife, heading the consulate.\n\nGermany's main political objectives for the Reichskommissariat, as laid out by the Reichstag and Bundesrat, included the colonisation of the occupied land, civilian work administatration led by the Reichswerke which would work to bring valuable resources back to Germany. Through the use of the Schutzmannschaft battalions, Germany seeked to maintain full control of their territory.\n\nThe territories included three administration zones headed by Erwin Rommel, Helga Mörder and Werner von Goldberg, who each act as their own administrative head from their own capital cities; Castle Dagonent, now Moltke, for Rommel, which is the capital of the Reichskommissariat; Germania for Helga Mörder, which is isolated from the other two in a small region; Hindenburg, controlled in the eastern part by Werner von Goldberg.\n\nAfter the increase of German territory, the Reichkommisarit was forced to split into the western Reichskommissariat Arthursland and Reichskommissariat Ostland in late 1941, which would be headed by then promoted Generalmajor Werner von Goldberg.\n\nPolicies[]\n\nIn Arthursland, the administration nationalised unused or poor land and turned them over to the Reichswerke, who build large food mega-plantations and ginourmous mines worked by the locals of the Continent but with Germans as work-unit leaders or heavy-equipment operators. In towns and cities, small workshops, industries were built to educate the local population. To the delight of the locals, tax never came in the form of currency but in conscription or work-service, making many living in the area very rich people.\n\nColonisation[]\n\nOne of the main goals of the Reichskommissariat is to allow the colonisation of the Continent with proper German citizens or to convert the locals of the Continent to German culture. Although, with the rise of technology and luxurious consumer products, the number of civilian volunteers of willing German citizens was low, leading for Arthursland to be known for the number of German civilians compared to the German soldiers to be only 2-to-1. Thus, they had to rely on the latter project for most of the time.\n\nEconomic exploitation[]\n\nAccording to order of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Reichswerke were given full administraive rights to mine the many valuable resources, which are being constantly being replenished by the Continent's magic, around their territory. Oil, gold, metal and even precious gems were being mined on a massive amount and exported straight beyond the Gate, leading to an economy boom in the German Empire with the surplus of resources.\n\nReligion[]\n\nBefore, the Church of the Paragons was the main religion of the area in German territory. After Germany established a very good hold on the region granted to them, Protestantism was introduced to the people of Arthursland via priests and missionaries arriving to the Continent. The Prussian Union of Churches officially established two Cathedrals, converting thousands to Christianity. Due to the rising Protestant precense, the Church of the Paragons had very tense relations with converted Protestants in German and Arthurian territory."
