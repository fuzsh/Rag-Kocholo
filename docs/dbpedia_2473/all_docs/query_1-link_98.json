        "text": "Starring: Jo Van Fleet, Robert H. Harris, John Qualen\n\nWritten by: Ray Bradbury\n\nDirected by: Robert Stevens\n\nFirst aired January 29, 1956\n\nEpisode Grade: C\n\nThis one SOUNDS like it’s gonna be really creepy and amazing. It’s not. Jo Van Fleet is amazing, though, as she always was.\n\nHitch’s Intro:\n\nI’m not even gonna tell you if the title card is the black serif letters or the white blocky sans-serif letters. I’m gonna just let you guess.\n\n(It’s the white blocky sans-serif)\n\nWe see our little Hitch at a door. He opens it, and closes it. It makes no sound. He adds some “oil” to the hinge and opens the door again, and it produces a perfectly creepy “rrrrreeeeeeeeee” and he says, “That’s better, much better.” He then goes on to extol the virtues of the “loud squeaking fluid.” It’s excellent at making old shutters bang, and old shoes squeak. Then he tells us tonight’s story is written by Ray Bradbury.\n\nWow, this is a short intro.\n\nEpisode Re-Cap & Commentary:\n\nWe see a car accident (they may be in New York City, that’s my guess), a traffic light laying on the street, and at the scene, among the crowd, are two little men in white linen suits. They are taking notes. A witness is telling a police officer: “Fifty miles per hour on a main boulevard, he musta been crazy!” The music makes an omnious BOOM.\n\nMore doomy music, as someone runs up to a doorman–who is standing at a revolving door….does that make him a revolving doorman? ha ha ha ha ha ha ha–uh, and points up to the sky. Then we see a long shot, someone plummeting to the ground from a skyscraper. That’s disturbing, no? Bells toll. The two little men are there again, this time in overcoats. The smaller of the little men is taking notes in his little notebook. A witness is saying “Maybe he slipped, or maybe he jumped…I don’t know!”\n\nAnd then we see a raging fire! And the doomy music plays as a witness says, “Someone left a cigarette burnin’, that’s what it was,” and the two little men are there again.\n\nThen we see the two little men, on a noisy street in what seems to be Brooklyn. The men are Clarence Fox (Robert Harris) and Elmer Shore (John Qualen). Clarence points to a brownstone and says to Elmer, “There it is. 989. That’s where she lives.” Children are playing in the water shooting from a hydrant. Elmer says, “Why are we here, why drag me here day after day in this heat to accidents and deaths and now this woman I’ve never even met…???”\n\nYeah, let’s get to the point already, we’re only two minutes in. In this handy exposition, we find out that Clarence and Elmer were insurance salesmen. They sold insurance (yes, they do repeat this, for our benefit). And then they retired three months before. But Clarence, a statistics buff, reminds Elmer that retired men are likely to die sooner rather than men who remain active. What I want to know is….Why are they wearing suits in 100-degree heat? What is that about? They’re wearing full, long-sleeved suits and HATS. I’m not a statistician, but I’ll bet the chances of you suffering from heat exhaustion are far higher when you’re wearing long pants and a long sleeved shirt and a blazer and a tie and a hat, in 100 degree heat. Just a hunch.\n\nClarence reiterates that they saw three deaths, all related to carelessness. (How does one fall off a building accidentally? How does one get on the precipice of a building accidentally?) And then the camera does a funny close-up of Elmer’s and Clarence’s sweaty, sweaty faces. Clarence looks in the distance and says eerily, “Why…..What’s behind it……?” I don’t know Clarence, but here’s a bottle of Aquafina and a fan and handkerchief and a popsicle and some shorts.\n\nBy the way, their ties are very short and wide. Their hats are Stetson straw hats.\n\nThey go to a counter, and order two glasses of milk. Milk? In hot weather? All I can think of is this:\n\nThen, as they’re drinking their milk from the……milk…stand….Uh, Mrs. Shrike (Jo Van Fleet) exits the brownstone. Holy moly, is she a mess. I mean, she is just beyond comprehension. She looks like a ragdoll that was left out in the rain and then chewed by dogs and then left out in the rain again and then ran over by a truck and then pooped on by stray cats and then left out in the rain again. She’s yelling. That’s all we’re gonna hear Mrs. Shrike do, friends. They should call her Mrs. SHRIEK. In fact, that’s what I’m going to call her from now on. I’ll bet Bradbury did that on purpose, too.\n\nAs she’s yelling, wearing a dumpy dress with the tag still hanging off of it, her hair a fried and frizzled mess, her neighbors tell her she’ll wake the baby (the baby is sleeping in a pram), and so Mrs. Shriek leans over and YELLS INTO THE PRAM because that’s the kind of nutjob she is. She walks down the street, bumping into Clarence and yelling “Get out of the way,” while kids follow her, both amused and thrilled at her utter ridiculousness. She stops in front of a man selling ice cream and says, “I want dat one dere” and the kids laugh. She laughs sarcastically in their faces and then throws the wrapper onto the sidewalk. She walks into a butcher shop. The windows say “CUT RATE MEATS” and ….ground round for 49 cents a pound. Wow! That’s a deal.\n\nMrs. Shriek opens the door–and Robert Stevens does a very Hitchcockian trick here, showing us the view from the perspective of the ceiling fan–and she pushes everyone to the side. Clarence and Elmer follow her in. Mrs. Shriek pushes two women out of the way as the butcher approaches her. It’s Michael Ansara! Oh yay! Hi Michael Ansara! Mrs. Shriek asks for a “good hunk of meat” (well, I guess that describes Michael Ansara, saaaaaaay!) and the butcher, also sweaty, says “yes ma’am” in a way that tells us he really, really hates her guts.\n\nClarence says to Elmer “Isn’t she BEAUTIFUL?” Except he says “isn’t she CLASSIC” but whatever.\n\nMrs. Shriek asks for BRAINS. Oh my gosh, she’s a ZOMBIE! EVERYONE RUUUUUN!\n\nShe specifies to the butcher that she wants fresh beef brains. Ew. Who the f*ck eats cow brains? She pesters the butcher and tells him to keep his “big fat thumbs off the scale”….He says “Yes ma’am” and she mocks him, with her annoying voice, and the butcher looks at the knife on the table and picks it up. She’s still eating her ice cream, too, and talking with her mouth open. He wraps up the brains and she says, “Thanks for nothin'” and tells him to charge it. As she leaves, the butcher asks Clarence and Elmer if he can help them. They look like hobbits next to Michael Ansara, I swear. They are so tiny. Clarence says, “I forgot the list, we’ll be back,” and the butcher watches them leave as he wipes away the sweat from his exotic face.\n\nOutside of the butcher shop, Clarence says to Elmer, “You see why she needs our help?” and Elmer says, “Yes, but she’s a destroyer, that one.” And Clarence says, “No, not a destroyer. She wants to BE destroyed!” They watch as Mrs. Shriek bullies the green grocer and tells him to get a new scale and then pushes a load of peaches all over the sidewalk. Oh my gosh, I’M going to murder her.\n\nClarence and Elmer decide to actually approach her. Directly. In her awful, terrible, disgusting flat. As they enter the brownstone, Mr. Shrike (Michael Ross) is being yelled at and he’s walking down the stairs going “Shut up! SHUT UP OR I’LL–” and then the knob from the staircase pops off in his hands. Like in my favorite movie of all time, only much, much less beautiful and not at all life-affirming.\n\nElmer says, “I feel like an old man, I’m dying of the heat,” and Clarence agrees that living in that building is like being boiled alive. Sounds nice! This is “murder weather” or something, Clarence says. I’d like to hear that on a weather forecast sometime, I would kiss that person on the lips. More murders are committed at 92 degrees than at any other temperature, Clarence says. (…Is this true? I’m gonna Google it.) They make the long trip up to Mrs. Shriek’s flat. They knock on the door, and they hear Mrs. Shriek shrieking. The door is open, and they find her yelling at her upstairs neighbors, who are playing loud big band music. I’m sure that’s how my neighbors feel about me, because that’s the music I listen to, I swear. When I’m cooking, I listen to Ray Conniff, I’m surprised I haven’t been killed already. Oh, wait, it’s not her neighbors, it’s HER playing HER radio, and she won’t turn it down! Clarence calls out “CAN YOU TURN. OFF. THE RADIO!” And she does.\n\nHer flat is just disgusting, dishes piled in the sink, filthy walls, everything is filthy and cluttered. She takes a soda from the fridge, and picks up a magazine. She sits down in a disgusting chair and Clarence asks her if he may sit down. “I’m busy, I got things to do,” she says, and Clarence sits down, saying “Thanks.” It’s nice to know Clarence has a sarcastic streak.\n\nClarence makes a pitch to her, about saving people, based on statistics, because people are dying before they should. Mrs. Shriek says “I’m not sick,” and Clarence says, “Sometimes people don’t know if they’re sick, and then they kill themselves.” Mrs. Shriek says, “I don’t kill myself.” I love that. I don’t kill myself.\n\n“But you might,” Clarence says, and for once he has Mrs. Shriek’s attention. He goes to the bathtub….which is…right in the middle of the flat….and points out that the light fixture is hanging right above it. The wire is frayed, making it quite a hazard. She could easily grab the frayed wire coming out of the tub and kill herself. Mrs. Shriek laughs at him. She says, lighting a cigarette, “So I’m dead. So you’ve come to the funeral early.”\n\nClarence tells her to put her food in the icebox. Because of food poisoning. Elmer announces that it’s now 91 degrees! Mrs. Shriek says, “Whatsa matta with your friend, he been out in the sun or sumpm?” And Clarence says “We all have, your husband has, he’s out there, getting hotter and hotter” (not in a sexy way, obviously) and Mrs. Shriek says, “Well you ain’t tell me nuttin.”\n\nShe asks Clarence if he goes around to all the buildings making speeches like this. Clarence says no. Just her. He says, Bad things happen. We lose money, we get sick. We get angry, we get mean. “Now you’re talkin’ my language” Mrs. Shriek says. Clarence continues that we make people want to hit us, even kill us. He then stops and says, “Could we open just one window?” Wait, Mrs. Shriek has food spoiling in her non-air-conditioned apartment, dirty dishes, and a lit cigarette in her hand, it’s 91 degrees and her windows are CLOSED?\n\nThen Clarence goes on to say that there are no accidents, really. He mentions the man who fell from the building, and the man who set the warehouse on fire. “Accident? No. They wanted to die.” There is a close-up of Mrs. Shriek’s face, and a baby is crying in the background. She looks rather like a baby, to be honest. A big sweaty frizzy baby.\n\nMrs. Shriek then has a glorious outburst. She’s angry that he’s there, making demands. Open the windows, PAH, that lets the flies in, STUPID. “Sure, I’ll fix this place up real nice,” she says, “I’ll sweep the floor, put on a nice clean dress, sweep the floor and make it real nice.” But she asks if Clarence can then make her 20 years younger and 40 pounds lighter. She’s both angry and sad, she’s crying and yelling. Her husband always comes home drunk and angry, they have no money, she doesn’t sleep because of the heat, she used to be so pretty, and she’s yelling and crying, “What do you know about me, tell me what you know about me?” Clarence begs for her to let them help her. She yells that she doesn’t need help and she throws the COWS BRAINS onto Clarence. Clarence raises his cane to strike her. Elmer stops him.\n\nClarence and Elmer hurry out of the building while Mrs. Shriek yells after them, “That was almost murder! Hey! MURDER!!!!! POLICE!”\n\nOn the stoop, Clarence and Elmer discuss what happened. Clarence calls himself an old fool, that Mrs. Shriek needed to be seen as a lost soul, not an experiment. Elmer says they should talk to the husband and tell him how his wife feels. No, says Clarence, he wouldn’t underst—\n\nThe Twist:\n\nClarence doesn’t finish the sentence because the doomy music starts, and Mr. Shrike comes barreling drunkenly down the street with a longshoreman’s hook in his belt loop, heading to his flat, where it is implied he will murder his wife, the poor shrewish Mrs. Shreik. Clarence then asks Elmer what the temperature is and Elmer says, “92 degrees.” We hear sirens and the police show up, a crowd gathers around the brownstone, and Clarence takes notes and Elmer leads him away.\n\nPlease make a note of it:\n\nThe very wonderful, excellent Jo Van Fleet is Mrs. Shriek. Shrike. Whatever. Jo Van Fleet was a marvelous actress. She won a Tony award for her performance in A Trip to Bountiful. She won an Academy Award for her performance in East of Eden (she played James Dean‘s mother). She is in a few other AHP episodes, one in the second season, with another excellent character actor, Oskar Homolka.\n\nThis is the first episode we meet Robert Harris. He’s one of my favorite AHP actors. He’s in quite a few episodes. This wasn’t his best, but that’s not his fault. He is in the Pantheon of AHP Roberts™ (I just made that up right now) which includes Robert Emhardt, Robert Harris, Robert Horton, Robert Stevens, Robert StevenSON, and Robert Middleton.\n\nRemember John Qualen? He played Step in this episode. He was an amusing little man, like a living cartoon."
