        "text": "Yes indeed she is very wonderful! She definitely speaks her mind and I intend to trawl through the Internet to find more video interviews of her to watch. It's a shame she became so reclusive in her later years as she's a shrewd observer of the world of Hollywood and fame she was a part of.\n\nShe also seems to speak well of Hitchcock and defends him a bit certainly more so than some of his other leading ladies.\n\nShe looked wonderful in that red suit, and wore something very similar when I saw her in 1978, or maybe it was the same one. I loved her as soon as she stepped out of her limousine and stated in a very no nonsense voice, \"I'd like to inspect the stage\"\n\nShe obviously took great care of how she was presented, and like so many of the great stars knew all about the best way to be lit. I was right up close to her when she was signing her book for me, she was very beautiful, and was 71 at that time.\n\n0\n\nHi folks, I'm still in Canada and able to watch and able to watch the US version of TCM which has a great selection of classic movies.\n\nJust watched a tribute to Barbara by actress Laura Dern with some clips of her movies which was a real treat.\n\nWalter, I know that Stella Dallas is not your favourite Barbara movie but the final scene when she conveys all that emotion with no dialogue is amazing, real tearjerker.\n\nOn a sadder note, Robert Osborne has been missing for several weeks and is believed to be having some health problems. Hope he is back soon although Ben Mankiewicz is a very effective host.\n\n0\n\nHi folks, I'm still in Canada and able to watch and able to watch the US version of TCM which has a great selection of classic movies.\n\nJust watched a tribute to Barbara by actress Laura Dern with some clips of her movies which was a real treat.\n\nWalter, I know that Stella Dallas is not your favourite Barbara movie but the final scene when she conveys all that emotion with no dialogue is amazing, real tearjerker.\n\nOn a sadder note, Robert Osborne has been missing for several weeks and is believed to be having some health problems. Hope he is back soon although Ben Mankiewicz is a very effective host.\n\nThat Laura Dern tribute is one of the best that I have seen, probably because she really is a genuine fan, and that comes across in just seven minutes, where she managed to cram in so many great clips of some of Barbara's best films.\n\nYes, that is a marvellous scene from Stella Dallas, and although it is not one of my favourites, it is certainly not because of her performance.\n\nI have put a link in here before, but here it is again for anyone who hasn't seen it, do watch it is a real treat, and shows just how versatile she was.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Aqj9MivCgQ\n\nVery sad to hear about Robert Osborne, he did look frail the last time that I saw him. I loved watching his introduction to Barbara's films because he really knows what he is talking about, and so many of the so called experts don't.\n\nOn a completely different subject, I was interviewed by phone on ITV's \"This Morning\"\n\nyesterday. They wanted to chat to viewers who are still having fun in their old age, so I sent them some of my London Marathon photo's, and they phoned me and I chatted to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby while they showed my photo's onscreen.\n\nThat is three TV appearances this year, and it's only June.\n\n0\n\nThe July issue of Sight and Sound has a 5 page feature on \"the last of the great pre-World War II Hollywood stars\": Olivia de Havilland, of course. Her run-in with Warner Brothers boss Jack Warner features heavily. Although she eventually won her case she was unable to make any films for 2 years at the height of her career. Warner even tried to have her banned from entertaining the troops.\n\nAs the feature writer says \"When we think of actresses who fought for their careers we think of [Bette] Davis, Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck; we should think too of de Havilland, who fought as hard, or harder, than any of them\".\n\n0\n\nShe looked wonderful in that red suit, and wore something very similar when I saw her in 1978, or maybe it was the same one. I loved her as soon as she stepped out of her limousine and stated in a very no nonsense voice, \"I'd like to inspect the stage\"\n\nShe obviously took great care of how she was presented, and like so many of the great stars knew all about the best way to be lit. I was right up close to her when she was signing her book for me, she was very beautiful, and was 71 at that time.\n\nShes also very easy to interview-Shes very open and eager to talk about her career in film,all things related to it and a lot of her personal stuff too.She would be a film historians dream.Such a shame she became quite reclusive in her later years.She had the exuberance of a true Hollywood star of this era without being over the yop.Understated but colourful?\n\nWhat would you say was Joans favourite amongst her own films?\n\nWho also were her Hollywood friends?\n\n0\n\nShes also very easy to interview-Shes very open and eager to talk about her career in film,all things related to it and a lot of her personal stuff too.She would be a film historians dream.Such a shame she became quite reclusive in her later years.She had the exuberance of a true Hollywood star of this era without being over the yop.Understated but colourful?\n\nWhat would you say was Joan's favourite amongst her own films?\n\nWho also were her Hollywood friends?\n\nIn one of the interviews Joan was asked about her favourite films, and of course Rebecca was among those mentioned. Other favourites were Jane Eyre opposite Orson Welles, and Letter From an Unknown Woman. She was particularly fond of The Constant Nymph, and her leading man Charles Boyer, she played a 14 year old girl when she was really 26. She was Nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, but lost to Jennifer Jones in the oh so dreary, Song of Bernadette. I always remember someone saying to me that they walked out of it when they discovered that it wasn't a Betty Grable musical.\n\nI can't recall hearing about her friends, although I doubt if she had any in Hollywood, she hadn't lived there for years.\n\n0\n\nIn one of the interviews Joan was asked about her favourite films, and of course Rebecca was among those mentioned.

Interestingly enough, she was only two years older than Susan, but she had always played older characters, and Susan looked a good 15 years younger than her actual age.\n\n0\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wickes#Filmography\n\nBorn on this day June 13th in 1910 American actress Mary Wickes.\n\nShe starred in a number of notable films and whilst not a big player or household name she certainly starred in some well known films and rubbed shoulders with some of the the big players.She'd be 106 today!\n\nShe played the wisecracking nurse of Bette Davis ill character in Now Voyager one of Bettes best films and also starred with Bette Davis in The man who came to dinner and in I'll see you in my dreams with Doris Day and Danny Thomas.\n\n0\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wickes#Filmography\n\nBorn on this day June 13th in 1910 American actress Mary Wickes.\n\nShe starred in a number of notable films and whilst not a big player or household name she certainly starred in some well known films and rubbed shoulders with some of the the big players.She'd be 106 today!\n\nShe played the wisecracking nurse of Bette Davis ill character in Now Voyager one of Bettes best films and also starred with Bette Davis in The man who came to dinner and in I'll see you in my dreams with Doris Day and Danny Thomas.\n\nAlong with Thelma Ritter, Mary was one of those wonderful character actresses that popped up in so many films. I loved her opening line in Now Voyager when she introduced herself to Bette saying, \"The name's Pickford, Dora, not Mary!\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Bette to realise how lucky she was to have her on her side against her old witch of a mother, and said to her approvingly, \"Dora, I suspect you're a treasure!\"\n\nMary also appeared in Bette's June Bride, and played the same character of Stella the maid, in two of Doris Day most successful musical comedies, On Moonlight By, and By the Light of the Silvery Moon.\n\nSister Act and it's sequel was not the first time that Mary had played a nun. she was Sister Clarissa in the wonderful Roz Russell film The Trouble With Angels, and the less successful sequel, Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows.\n\n0\n\nLol, I never even noticed Walter.\n\nI love hearing that someone you admire was nice and popular in real life.\n\nWas this I Love Lucy, Walter?\n\nMary Poppins! Another bit of info I never knew.\n\nI loved all those actresses in the 40's and 50's who played wise cracking gals. Like Eve Arnold and the actress who played Ma Kettle? Sorry, her name escapes me\n\nDavid, in 1952 Mary made her debut in I Love Lucy playing Madame Lamond, a ballet teacher. Then between 1963 and 1967 she made eight appearances in The Lucy Show, and from 1969 to 1974 she appeared in nine episodes of Here's Lucy.\n\nI guess that you meant Eve Arden, Joan Crawford's wisecracking friend in Mildred Pierce, and Barbara's understanding friend in My Reputation, she was also terrific in Stage Door, and The Dark at the Top of the Stairs.\n\nMa Kettle was played by Marjorie Main, who in one of her first roles, played Barbara's mother in Stella Dallas, and was wonderful in The Women and Meet Me in St Louis.\n\n0\n\nThank you Walter and apologies, I should have double checked the names before posting, no excuse in this day and age.\n\nI have never heard of My Reputation, I am off to read what that's about.\n\nDavid, My Reputation was the first film that I saw of Barbara's, 70 years ago this year.\n\nAlthough I was just nine years old she totally fascinated me, and when I saw her in The Other Love the following year, I became a lifelong fan.\n\nYou can see the official trailer of My Reputation on YouTube, as well as several scenes, including one with Eve Arden. It is a beautiful film, definitely in my top three of all her films, she looks stunning in her Edith Head wardrobe, and it has one of the best musical scores from Max Steiner that I have ever heard.\n\n0\n\nGoodness me I hadn't expected Mary wickes to prompt so much interest and so many replies as I must confess shes barely ever been on my radar if at all! I do remember her with Bette Davis in Non Voyager now that Ive been back and looked it up!\n\nOn this day in June 16th in 1924 actress Faith Domergue was born.She died in 1999.\n\nShe starred in a 1954 tense murder mystery drama \"This is my love\" with a cast lead by Linda Darnell and rick Jason.\n\nAnother film she starred in was 1955 film \"Vendetta\" which was producded by Howard Hughes but had some behind the scenes drama as Howard sacked several of the directors including Preston Sturges (Barbara Stanwyck connection!) before he settled on his choice but even then he ended up doing a significant amount of the directing himself.\n\nIndependent golden era Hollywood horror film \" Cult of the Cobra\" was also a film added to Faiths bow were she co-starred with Richard Long and Jack Kelly.\n\nLatterly she made a few british films including \"Man in the shadow\" or Violent Stranger as it was renamed for the US market.Zachary Scott was a co-star.\n\n0"
