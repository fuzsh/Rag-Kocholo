        "text": "American actor (1925–1989)\n\nClarence LeRoy Van Cleef Jr. (January 9, 1925 – December 16, 1989) was an American actor. He appeared in over 170 film and television roles in a career spanning nearly 40 years, but is best known as a star of Italian Spaghetti Westerns, particularly the Sergio Leone-directed Dollars Trilogy films For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). In 1983, he received a Golden Boot Award for his contribution to the Western film and television genre.\n\nBorn and raised in Somerville, New Jersey, Van Cleef served in the United States Navy during World War II aboard a minesweeper, earning a Bronze Star for his actions. After acting on stage in regional theatre, he made his film debut in the Oscar-winning Western High Noon (1952) in a non-speaking outlaw cast role. With distinctive, angular features and a taciturn screen persona,[1] Van Cleef was typecast as minor villain and supporting player in Westerns and crime dramas. After suffering serious injuries in a car crash, Van Cleef's acting career started to decline. However, he achieved unexpected stardom when director Sergio Leone offered him the co-leading role in For a Few Dollars More. The film proved to be a huge hit and cited him as a box-office draw, largely in Europe.\n\nVan Cleef went on to appear in films such as Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), as well as The Big Gundown (1967), Death Rides a Horse (1967), Day of Anger (1967), Beyond the Law (1968), Commandos (also 1968), Sabata (1969) and its sequel Return of Sabata (1971), Barquero (1970), El Condor (also 1970), The Magnificent Seven Ride! (1972), The Grand Duel (also 1972), Mean Frank and Crazy Tony (1973), The Stranger and the Gunfighter (1974), Take a Hard Ride (1975), God's Gun (1976), The Rip-Off (1978), television film The Hard Way (1979), The Octagon (1980), Escape from New York (1981), Code Name: Wild Geese (1984), Armed Response (1986) and Speed Zone (1989). He also played the lead role of John Peter McAllister on the martial arts television series The Master (1984).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLee Van Cleef was born on January 9, 1925, in Somerville, New Jersey,[2] to Marion Lavinia Van Fleet and Clarence LeRoy Van Cleef. His father was a pharmacist and his mother a concert pianist, both of Dutch descent. Lee graduated high school early at the age of 17 from Somerville High School,[3] in order to enlist in the United States Navy in September 1942.[4]\n\nMilitary service\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter completing his military training, Van Cleef was assigned to a submarine chaser and then to a minesweeper called the USS Incredible, on which he worked as a sonarman.\n\nThe ship initially patrolled the Caribbean, then moved to the Mediterranean, participating in the landings in southern France. In January 1945, Incredible moved to the Black Sea, and performed sweeping duties out of the Soviet Navy base at Sevastopol, Crimea. Afterwards, the ship performed air-sea rescue patrols in the Black Sea before returning to Palermo, Sicily.\n\nBy the time of his discharge in March 1946, he had achieved the rank of Sonarman First Class (SO1) and had earned his mine sweeper patch. He also had been awarded the Bronze Star and the Good Conduct Medal. By virtue of his deployments, Van Cleef also qualified for the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.[5] He was discharged from the navy in 1946.[6]\n\nBronze Star Good Conduct Medal European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal American Campaign Medal World War II Victory Medal\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter leaving the navy, Van Cleef received his first acting role as a reader for the play Our Town at the Little Theater Group in Clinton, New Jersey.[1] From there, he continued to meet with the group and audition for parts. The next biggest part was that of the boxer, Joe Pendleton, in the play Heaven Can Wait. During this time, he was observed by visiting talent scouts, who were impressed by Van Cleef's stage presence and delivery. One of these scouts later took him to New York City talent agent Maynard Morris of the MCA agency, who then sent him to the Alvin Theater for an audition. The play was Mister Roberts.[7]\n\nVan Cleef's screen debut came in High Noon.[2] During a performance of Mister Roberts in Los Angeles, he was noticed by film producer Stanley Kramer, who offered Van Cleef a role in his upcoming film. Kramer originally wanted Van Cleef for the role of the deputy Harvey Pell, but as he wanted Van Cleef to have his \"distinctive nose\" fixed, Van Cleef declined the role in favor of the part of the silent gunslinger Jack Colby. He was then cast mostly in villainous roles, from the part of Tony Romano in Kansas City Confidential (1952),[8] culminating 14 years later in Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).[9]\n\nAside from Westerns and the science fiction films, three of his early major roles were in noir films, Kansas City Confidential (1952), Vice Squad (1953) and The Big Combo (1955).\n\nIn 1952, he made his television debut when he was cast in the episode \"Formula for Fear\" of the Western aviation series Sky King. Van Cleef appeared six times between 1953 and 1955 on the children's syndicated Western series The Adventures of Kit Carson, starring Bill Williams. He was cast three times, including the role of Rocky Hatch in the episode \"Greed Rides the Range\" (1952), of another syndicated Western series, The Range Rider. He appeared in episode 82 of the TV series The Lone Ranger in 1952.[10] In 1954, he appeared as Jesse James in the syndicated series Stories of the Century.[11]\n\nIn 1955, he was cast twice on another syndicated Western series, Annie Oakley. That same year, he guest-starred on the CBS Western series Brave Eagle. In 1955, he played one of the two villains in an episode of The Adventures of Champion the Wonder Horse. He played Cherokee Bob in the NBC Western series Tales of Wells Fargo in 1957.[12] In 1958, he was cast as Ed Murdock, a rodeo performer trying to reclaim the title in the event at Madison Square Garden in New York City, on Richard Diamond, Private Detective.[13]\n\nVan Cleef played different characters on four episodes of ABC's The Rifleman, with Chuck Connors, between 1959 and 1962 (as Stinger in S2 E31 \"The Prodigal\" 1960), and twice on ABC's Tombstone Territory. In 1958, he was cast as Deputy Sid Carver in the episode \"The Great Stagecoach Robbery\" of another syndicated Western series, Frontier Doctor, starring Rex Allen. In 1959, Van Cleef appeared as Luke Clagg in the episode \"Strange Request\" of the NBC Western series Riverboat starring Darren McGavin, as Jumbo Kane in the episode \"The Hostage\" on the CBS Western series \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" starring Steve McQueen, and in an episode of Maverick titled \"Red Dog\" in 1961 starring Roger Moore and John Carradine.\n\nVan Cleef played a sentry on an episode of the ABC sitcom The Real McCoys, with Walter Brennan. Van Cleef was cast with Pippa Scott and again with Chuck Connors in the 1960 episode \"Trial by Fear\" of the CBS anthology series The DuPont Show with June Allyson. A young Van Cleef also made an appearance on The Andy Griffith Show and as Frank Diamond in The Untouchables, in an episode entitled \"The Unhired Assassin\". He also appeared in an episode of the ABC/Warner Brothers Western series The Alaskans.[14]\n\nVan Cleef guest-starred on the CBS Western series Have Gun – Will Travel, on the ABC/Warner Bros. series Colt .45, on the NBC Western series Cimarron City and Laramie, and on Rod Cameron's syndicated crime dramas City Detective and State Trooper. He guest-starred in an episode of John Bromfield's syndicated crime drama Sheriff of Cochise. Van Cleef starred as minor villains and henchmen in various Westerns, including The Tin Star and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.[15] His film characters died in many of his Westerns and gangster portrayals.\n\nIn 1960, he appeared as a villainous swindler in the Bonanza episode, \"The Bloodline\" (December 31, 1960) and also made an appearance on Gunsmoke. In 1961, he played a role on episode 7 (\"The Grave\") of the third season of The Twilight Zone starring Lee Marvin. He played a villainous henchman of Lee Marvin's titular character in the 1962 John Ford movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance starring John Wayne and James Stewart. In 1963, he appeared on Perry Mason (episode: \"The Case of the Golden Oranges\"). That same year, he appeared in \"The Day of the Misfits\" on The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters.\n\nStardom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1965, Sergio Leone cast Van Cleef, whose career had yet to take off, as a main protagonist alongside Clint Eastwood in For a Few Dollars More.[16] Leone then chose Van Cleef to appear again with Eastwood, this time as the primary antagonist, Angel Eyes, in the now seminal Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).\n\nWith his roles in Leone's films, Van Cleef became a major star of Spaghetti Westerns, playing central, and often surprisingly heroic, roles in films such as The Big Gundown (1966), Death Rides a Horse (1967), Day of Anger (1967), and The Grand Duel (1972). He played the title role in Sabata (1969) and Return of Sabata (1971), and co-starred with Jim Brown in an Italian-American co-production, Take a Hard Ride (1975). In two of his final westerns he co-starred with Leif Garrett in God's Gun (1976) and Kid Vengeance (1977), both of which were filmed mainly in Israel. During the 1970's Van Cleef also had leading roles, in American Westerns such as Barquero (1970), El Condor (1970) and The Magnificent Seven Ride! (1972).\n\nVan Cleef starred alongside Chuck Norris in the martial arts film The Octagon (1980). Van Cleef later had a supporting role in John Carpenter's cult film Escape from New York (1981).[17] He slipped out of the limelight in his later years.[18] In 1984, he was cast as a ninja master in the NBC adventure series The Master, but it was canceled after thirteen episodes. Van Cleef also appeared alongside David Carradine in Armed Response (1986). In all, Van Cleef is credited with 90 movie roles and 109 television appearances over a 38-year span.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nVan Cleef was married three times. His first marriage was to Patsy Ruth Kahle, in 1943. They had three children, Alan, Deborah and David. They divorced in 1958.[19] His second marriage was to Joan Marjorie Drane, from 1960 to 1974.[20] His final marriage was to Barbara Havelone in 1976, who survived him.[21]\n\nHe lost the last joint of his right hand middle finger while building a playhouse for his daughter.[22]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite suffering from heart disease from the late 1970s and having a pacemaker installed in the early 1980s,[23] Van Cleef continued to work in films until his death on December 16, 1989, 24 days short of his 65th birthday.[24] He collapsed from a heart attack in his home in Oxnard, California.[25] Throat cancer was listed as a secondary cause of death.[26]\n\nHe was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Hollywood Hills, California, with an inscription on his grave marker reading \"BEST OF THE BAD\", referring to his many notable acting performances as a villain.[27]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Director Notes 1952 High Noon Jack Colby Fred Zinnemann Untamed Frontier Dave Chittun Hugo Fregonese Kansas City Confidential Tony Romano Phil Karlson 1953 The Lawless Breed Dirk Hanley Raoul Walsh The Bandits of Corsica Nerva Ray Nazarro White Lightning Brutus Allen Edward Bernds The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms Corporal Stone Eugène Louriéby Arena \"Smitty\" Smith Richard Fleischer Vice Squad Pete Monte Arnold Laven Jack Slade \"Bolt\" Mackay Harold D.

Van Cleef is portrayed by the film's director Peter Richardson, though it rather suggests Van Cleef the personage is unrealistically playing Tony Benn, a British member of Parliament.\n\nVan Cleef served as visual inspiration for the characters of Revolver Ocelot and Old Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video game series as well as inspiring the gunslinger personality of the former.\n\nHungarian musician Tamás Cseh wrote the song \"Lee van Cleef\".[32][33]\n\nBritish singers Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott mention Lee and Clint Eastwood in the song, \"When I Get Back to Blighty\".\n\nStargate SG-1 has references to Lee Van Cleef in Season 4, Episode 20 \"Entity\". The 'Entity' is searching through personnel files on a projected computer screen, with the first listed name that shows up as Lee Van Cleef, with team designation \"SG-1\" and a rank of \"Master\". His name appears several more times with pictures of different people. [34]\n\nIn the 2000 comedy-western film Shanghai Noon, actor Xander Berkeley portrays an antagonistic character named Marshal Nathan Van Cleef.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
