        "text": "Greta Van Fleet frontman Josh Kiszka has defiantly responded to the band’s critics saying they’re “pissed off we’re doing something.”\n\nEver since the Frankenmuth rockers burst onto the scene in 2017 with their acclaimed ‘Black Smoke Rising’ and ‘From the Fires’ EPs, Greta Van Fleet have been plagued with comparisons to Led Zeppelin in particular.\n\nRobert Plant himself joked in April 2018 that Josh Kiska “borrowed (his voice) from somebody I know very well” and a year later prog rocker Steven Wilson savaged Greta Van Fleet calling them “terrible” and “like a boy band version of Led Zeppelin.”\n\nIn 2019, Kiska called for an end to the Led Zep comparisons, saying: “We hear the similarity... That’s one of the influences of ours. But at this point it’s like, ‘Okay, we’ve acknowledged that. Let’s move on.'”\n\nAhead of the release of Greta Van Fleet’s second studio album ‘The Battle at Garden’s Gate’ on Friday (16th April), Josh Kiska caught up with The Guardian for a wide-ranging chat and answered the band’s critics.\n\nMaking light of his own criticisms, Kiska joked: “I’ve gotten plenty of ridicule and I expect to get more. In fact, I’m looking forward to it.”\n\nAsked more about the band’s naysayers, Kiska added: “Some people are writing their articles in their mother’s basement and they’re pissed off that we’re doing something.\n\n“If your career is writing negative things about people, I would think you’d have something better to do.”\n\nHe continued: “If you drop flaming nitrous in someone’s lap, I think they’ll notice. It’s a sign that we’ve done something to arouse people in some way or other.\n\n“F*** anybody for putting it down. This is what we’re going to do.”\n\n‘The Battle at Garden’s Gate’ has been helmed by acclaimed producer Greg Kurstin (Foo Fighters, Paul McCartney, Katy Perry) and it was recorded at Henson Recording Studios and No Expectations Studio in California. The album features the singles ‘Age of Machine’ and ‘Broken Bells.’\n\nThe cover stars of seminal album covers revealed:\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
