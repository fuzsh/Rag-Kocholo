        "text": "AT:\n\nGR:\n\nCR:\n\nTuned In\n\nHD: Remembering Jo Van Fleet: Local theater aficionados pay tribute to\n\nBroadway, Hollywood actress\n\nBY: Brian McCoy\n\nCL: LONG ON TALENT: Jo Van Fleet, who died June 10 at the age of 81, lounges\n\nduring a scene from the 1936-37 University of the Pacific production\n\nOliver, Oliver.

Van Fleet won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy\n\nAwards for her portrayal of Deans mother in the 1955 film. -- SHE HIT HER\n\nMARKS: Van Fleet takes center stage in Neil Simons The Gingerbread Lady,\n\nwhich ran on Broadway during the early 1970s. (Photos courtesy of Tom\n\nMcKenzie\n\nLionel Kranitz had learned the news just 10 minutes before; the dismay in his\n\nvoice was fresh. Im really a bit numbed out right now, he said.\n\nThe shock and sadness, however, did not deter him. Kranitz had a story to\n\ntell, a story of the theater that is, no doubt, as old as theater. The focus\n\nof his tale and his grief that morning last week was Jo Van Fleet. The actress\n\n-- raised in Oakland and educated at then-College of the Pacific -- died in New\n\nYork June 10. Said to be 81, some reference books gave her age as 76.\n\nFleet won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of James Deans\n\nmother in 1955s East Of Eden. The performance marked her film debut; and\n\nover the next 15 years Fleet worked with a number of Hollywood legends,\n\nincluding Burt Lancaster (The Rose Tattoo, Susan Hayward (Ill Cry\n\nTomorrow, Clark Gable (The King and Four Queens, Kirk Douglas\n\n(Gunfight At the O.K. Corral, Montgomery Clift (Wild River and Paul\n\nNewman (Cool Hand Luke.\n\nShe started her career on Broadway in the 1940s and returned there in the\n\nmid-50s, winning a 1957 Tony Award for her work in Horton Footes Trip to\n\nBountiful. Kranitzs story dates from that era but another show, a\n\nproduction of Thomas Wolfes Look Homeward, Angel starring Fleet and\n\nAnthony Perkins.\n\nShe was a very big star, and I was Anthony Perkins understudy, recalled\n\nKranitz, now a Manteca clinical psychologist. Then one night, like it says\n\nin the movies, Tony was too sick to go on and I went on.\n\nTempestuous talent\n\nFor Kranitz, the performance was a potential career-maker. For Fleet, it meant\n\nsharing the spotlight with an untested actor. On stage that night, she made\n\nevery effort to steal scenes, until Kranitz put an end to that.\n\nI decided, F--- you, lady; this is it for me. Jo, at that point, decided I\n\nwas a worthy opponent, and we became friends. We ran for over a year, and we\n\nbecame friends socially. She was a good friend for that period of time.\n\nI think she was an enormously talented woman, Kranitz added. Great lady.\n\nIf you decided not to belly up to her\n\nbull----, she came across as a human being.\n\nThat image of Fleet -- talented but tempestuous, initially difficult to know\n\nbut capable of warm, lasting relationships -- was reinforced by other San\n\nJoaquin County residents who knew the actress as an aspiring undergraduate, an\n\nEnglish and theater teacher at Ripon High School, even as a star of Broadway\n\nand Hollywood.\n\nLocally, no one knew Fleet better than DeMarcus Brown. Now 96, the architect\n\nof UOPs drama and dance department taught and directed Fleet during her\n\nStockton days in the late 1930s, and the two remained in close contact until\n\njust a few weeks ago.\n\nShes visited here and Ive visited her home many times, Brown said. I\n\ncalled a short time ago and got no answer and then reached her son and\n\ndaughter-in-law, who live in Toronto. Thats when I learned how ill she was.\n\nShe was in a coma for several weeks.\n\nSixty years after the productions, Brown vividly recalls Fleets UOP\n\nperformances. She did a very fine Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew and\n\na very good comedy called Oliver, Oliver, he said.\n\nThe Oscar\n\nShe earned a teaching credential at UOP in the late 30s; years later, she was\n\nawarded and honorary degree. After earning her credential, Fleet taught\n\nEnglish and theater in Ripon. Student Alice Anderson recalls the young\n\ninstructor bringing a new perspective to the drama department, moving it from\n\nmelodramas to more sophisticated fare. Moreover, through her connection with\n\nBrown, she was able to borrow Pacifics costumes and sets.\n\nWe enjoyed her because she was young and she could relate with us,\n\nAnderson said. There are a lot of interesting stories about her.\n\nThere was a little bit of, not scandal but talk anyway, because she dared to\n\ngo out with one of the high school seniors. They went out dancing and, of\n\ncourse, in a place like Ripon, its a parochial thing and everybody was\n\nshocked.\n\nThe principal who hired Fleet recalled no such incident. Either way, she left\n\nRipon and, at Browns urging, decided to pursue theater in New York.\n\nAt that time, New York seemed like another world to me, Fleet told the\n\nAssociated Press Bob Thomas in a mid-50s interview. But (Brown kept at me\n\nuntil he convinced me to go.\n\nThe AP story continues: After she won the Academy Award, she telephoned her\n\nformer teacher to offer her thanks for his help. This, he said through his\n\ntears, makes up for whatever disappointments I may have had in the teaching\n\nprofession.\n\nFleet moved East, enrolled at the Neighborhood Playhouse and studied some at\n\nthe Actors Studio. She made her New York debut in 1946 and over the next 10\n\nyears moved between Broadway (she worked with Tennessee Williams in Camino\n\nReal and on the one-act that became A Streetcar Named Desire and early\n\ntelevision drama (where the likes of Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling wrote for\n\nher.\n\nBrown remained in contact. He recalled one trip to New York where Fleet\n\ninsisted they attend one particular play. She said, I want you to see this\n\nyoung actor, hes going to be important. The talent in question was\n\nMontgomery Clift.\n\nBittersweet career\n\nClifts self-destruction would claim him six years after working with Fleet in\n\nWild River. James Dean would die soon after the premiere of East of\n\nEden, also directed by Elia Kazan.\n\nHis death was a real blow to her, Brown recalled. She was very fond of\n\n(Dean. She thought he was a very remarkable actor at the time.\n\nCool Hand Luke was filmed in Stockton in the fall of 1966 and Fleet stayed\n\nwith Brown during the shoot. Paul (Newman used to bring her back from (the\n\nset, he said.\n\nThe picture ended a six-year screen hiatus, and its success brought a flurry\n\nof offers. She appeared with Peter Sellers in I Love You, Alice B. Tolkas,\n\nand a novice Robert DeNiro in The Gang That Couldnt Shoot Straight. Her\n\nfinal film was Roman Polanskis 1976 black comedy, The Tenant.\n\nShe remained active in theater, taking on such projects as Neil Simons\n\nThe Gingerbread Lady and an Arthur Miller-directed revival of Death Of A\n\nSalesman. She maintained her Stockton ties, too, helping to launch Lincoln\n\nHigh Schools theater program and accepting an Outstanding Alumnus Award from\n\nUOP.\n\nIn her busiest three decades as an actress, Fleet worked with the legends of\n\nHollywood, Broadway and television. She was not, however, entirely pleased by\n\nthe trajectory of her career.\n\nIt was a disappointment, Brown said. She wanted to do more and\n\ncircumstances just never turned out. She didnt get to do the big roles she\n\nshould have had.\n\nWhy? Part of the reason was poor health, which dogged Fleet through much of\n\nher later life. But there also was the tempestuous nature that made her such a\n\nfine Catherine in Browns Taming of The Shrew and that Kranitz saw on\n\nstage in Look Homeward, Angel.\n\nShe was difficult ... nobody wanted to direct her because she was hard to\n\nmanage, Brown said. She was a very bright woman and incredibly talented,\n\nand, sometimes, she was so talented it became almost a hindrance to her. She\n\nknew so much that she got herself into trouble more times than not.\n\nShe was such a fine actress, I think she was one of the finest actresses of\n\nthe century, he added. And she would take no crap from anybody.\n\n(Record Staff Writer Dianne Runion contributed to this story.\n\nBrian McCoy writes a weekly radio column.
