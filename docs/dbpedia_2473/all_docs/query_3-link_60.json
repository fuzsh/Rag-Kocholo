Barcelona is buzzing with new faces taking centre stage and thoroughly earning their top-billing as a key part of the Louis Vuitton 37th Americaâs Cup, lighting an exciting pathway for the future. Racing starts with the UniCredit Youth Americaâs Cup from the 17th -26th September whilst the inaugural Puig Womenâs Americaâs Cup runs from the 5th â 13th October. We catch up with the teams as they navigated July with some team members competing at the Paris Olympic Games whilst others worked hard on technique in Barcelona:",

        "text": "Alinghi Red Bull Racing – Youth & Women’s Team Update\n\n16 days sailed in Barcelona in various wind/sea state conditions. The venue delivered great forecast to train.\n\nNo capsizes\n\nSuper happy to have been able to train this much on water\n\nStarted to train with other Youth & Women’s teams, respecting the limitations\n\nSailing skills are improving, as well as shore skills\n\nTwo skippers announced (Nathalie Brugger for our Women’s team / Jann Schüpbach for our Youth team)\n\nShore & Tech pathway: learning day after day and enjoying the immersive experience within the team\n\n2 of our sailors are at the Olympic Games: Maja Siegenthaler (470), Arno de Planta (49er).\n\nIn July, two UniCredit Youth & Puig Women’s America’s Cup sailors at Alinghi Red Bull Racing received the special honour and responsibility of skippering for their respective teams: Jann Schüpbach for the Youth squad and Nathalie Brugger for the Women’s team.\n\nSince their selection last October, all sailors in the Youth & Women’s teams have been busy training hard and testing different crew configurations onboard the AC40s in order to assemble the most competitive squads. For Jann Schüpbach (04.12.2000, Thun, Thunersee Yachtclub), whose background is in foiling yachts (69F, Moth, Waszp) with experience in Olympic campaigning, his new role as team skipper came as a welcome surprise.\n\n“It's really cool to see the coaching staff and the management trust me to take more responsibility and believe the way I work and communicate with the team is right. It was definitely a surprise that it already happened! After testing different skippers for the last few weeks, I wasn’t expecting it at all.”\n\nDriven by his goal to compete for Switzerland on the world stage, Jann says it’s been a long but rewarding road. “This has been a dream of mine since I watched the America's Cup in Valencia in 2007 with Alinghi winning the Cup, so it means the world to me. I've been really pushing for this goal for the last few years. It hasn't always been easy – I wasn’t always sure if it was the right thing to do – and now that it’s paid off, I'm really proud to represent Switzerland and Alinghi Red Bull Racing in the America's Cup.”\n\nNathalie Brugger (25.12.1985, Fribourg, Gstaad Yacht Club (CN Morges/ CV Estavayer), a three-time Olympian (2x in the Laser Radial and 1x in the Nacra 17) and now challenging for the world’s first Women’s America’s Cup, also takes her new position seriously and is ready to bring her A-game.\n\n“It’s a huge honour to represent my country in the oldest sailing competition in the world, but it also brings a significant amount of responsibility. My main focus is on advancing and growing as a team, because we'll only see results if we can effectively collaborate and steer together. I hope to share the insights I've gained from three Olympic campaigns while learning from my teammates who have deeper experience in other areas.”\n\nThe YWAC Selection Committee was made up of Coraline Jonet (Youth & Women's Project Manager), Matias Bühler (Head Coach for the Youth & Women’s Teams) and Pierre-Yves Jorand (Leadership & Senior Advisor). Coraline Jonet said it was a unanimous decision in selecting both new skippers, for “their investment in the project, their reliability and sense of responsibility, and for the trust that both we and the other sailors have in them.\n\nOf the 12 sailors representing the Alinghi Red Bull Racing Youth & Women’s teams, 10 are currently in full training mode at the Team Base in Barcelona. Maja Siegenthaler and Arno de Planta will reunite with the others towards the end of August having just competed in Marseille in the Olympic classes of 470 and 49er.\n\nOn the water, the teams have reported strong progress in recent weeks across many areas, including pre-starts, routines and simulated high-pressure scenarios. As they enter the final stages of training, the athletes will need to maintain this pace to stay competitive against the 11 other teams for the UniCredit Youth & Puig Women’s America’s Cup.\n\nAthena Pathway\n\nAthena Pathway have had a busy July with two full Women’s and Youth sailing squads which we are sailing with at the moment. They are getting dialled in and we're testing multiple different team configurations and set ups on the AC40.\n\nIn July we welcomed another female helm, Tash Bryant, previously from Andoo Team Australia but with two British parents, she has got stuck in on the yacht and fitted into the team incredibly well.\n\nWe've been cheering on all of our Olympian friends at Team GB at the Paris 2024 Games and have been very proud of everyone!\n\nNew York Yacht Club American Magic - July Update\n\n“We are definitely getting toward the business end of this competition!” - Terry Hutchinson, NYYC American Magic Skipper and President of Sailing Operations\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, we have been through intensive race development and performance development. In the next few weeks, we have informal practice racing, leading into the beginning of the 37th America’s Cup, starting with the preliminary regatta on August 22.\n\nAmerican Magic Women’s Team Update\n\nOur women's team has been training at our base in Badalona alongside our youth team. We sail 4-5 days per week, rotating through sailors, with the other days dedicated to boat work and sail maintenance. We've been training in wind speeds ranging from 7 to 18 knots, and sea states up to 1.2m. One of our team members, Erika Reineke, headed off to the Olympics this month (good luck, Erika!), and we look forward to having her back in August.\n\nAmerican Magic Youth Team Update\n\nJuly was an exciting month as we announced our Youth Team! Harry Melges, Severin Gramm, Kyle Navin, Ripley Shelley, Ian MacDiarmid, Finn Rowe, and Ben Rosenberg make up the seven members of our youth team, and all are here at our base in Badalona training full-time on the AC40. Alongside the women's team, we sail 4 to 5 days per week, rotating through sailors, with the other days focused on boat work and sail maintenance. We've been training in wind speeds ranging from 7 to 18 knots, and sea states up to 1.2m.\n\nLuna Rossa Prada Pirelli Youth & Women’s Team Update\n\nThe second training session in Barcelona took place July 16-30.\n\nThe women's crew sailed 6 days for a total of 25 hours.\n\nThe Youth crew sailed 6 days for a total of 25 hours.\n\nDuring this period the team encountered a variety of weather conditions and wind, mostly from S-SW, ranging from 6 to 20 knots.\n\nThe Youth team alternated full day sessions with others shared with the women crew.\n\nTraining sessions took place mainly off Barceloneta, and sometimes outside Badalona.\n\nIn addition to departures, general performance and manoeuvres, the team has been working hard to optimise communication on board.\n\nThe next training session will be August 5-20.\n\nSimone Salvà, the Youth & Women’s team coach commented: “We were fortunate to experience a full range of wind conditions, which will be very useful for racing. On the last day we sailed in over 20 knots and very formed waves, completing the entire program flawlessly. There were a lot of other teams on the water during these days, and although the rule forbids a line- up, we had some very interesting crossings which confirmed our potential. In my opinion we achieved some very good speed insights, and the crew has grown tremendously in terms of confidence with the boat and precision in manoeuvring. During the July sessions we focused on performance and starting procedures (taking advantage of the support chase boat) and worked on timing and manoeuvring out of crossings. I am very happy with the work we have done so far and, in general, with the team, which is growing more close-knit and bonded every day. During the next session in August, with no more limitations in terms of engagement with other teams, we will have the opportunity to meet our opponents for the first time, although not officially. We are really looking forward to it, to feel the adrenaline of competition once again and fully understand how and where we stand compared to the rest of the fleet.”\n\nEmirates Team New Zealand - Youth & Women\n\nA transition month for Emirates Team New Zealand with a number of the team including Josh Armit, Veerle Ten Haave, Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, competing at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The team are beginning to arrive in Barcelona at the beginning of August with the team's two AC40s now on-site at the base and once everyone is in place, training will re-commence with some intense sailing planned in the lead up to the UniCredit Youth America's Cup in September ahead of the Puig Women's America's Cup in October.\n\nOlympic Results and Standings at publication:\n\nWomen's Team:\n\nJo Aleh/Molly Meech finish 7th at the Olympics in the 49er FX class.\n\nErica Dawson sitting in 2nd (at time of writing).\n\nYouth Team:\n\nJosh Armit finish 4th at the Olympics in the IQ Foil class. Veerle Ten Have finish 10th at the Olympics in the IQ Foil class.\n\nOrient Express L'Oreal Racing Team\n\nWith 50 days to go to the UniCredit Youth America’s Cup, and after an intense period in July, Orient Express - L’Oréal Racing Team’s youngest members give us an update on where they are at before the home stretch and the official practice racing against the other teams in August. On the 26 August, the Youth teams must return the AC40 to the organisation.\n\nWhile Lou, Enzo, Matisse, Gaultier and Ange focussed on individual regattas and their school exams in June, the six youth sailors – now based full time in Barcelona – pulled out all the stops in July putting in a maximum of hours on the water and continuing with their technical training onboard the AC40.\n\n“Our training in the management of the technical aspects of the AC40 began at the start of 2024 with the Boat Captain, Antoine Rucard,” said Gaultier Tallieu, trimmer aboard the AC40. “He has trained us to manage as many things as possible on board and in the launch phase. This knowledge enables us to be a little more autonomous, at least when it comes to diagnosing problems. On a personal level, it's an incredible amount of know-how that we're gaining.”\n\nOn the sailing side:\n\nEnzo Balanger, Orient Express - L’Oréal Racing Team’s skipper: “In July, there were several youth team AC40s sailing off Barcelona and we were able to evaluate ourselves against our competitors. We did a few line ups with Luna Rossa, one of the favourite teams. We're comfortable on board. Our strengths lie in the light and medium wind range. We have more difficulty in stronger breeze and need to figure out the pilot in over 15 knots of wind. The boat goes faster, as do the waves, and we need to find the right sailing philosophy in this type of configuration. But we're in the game, and quite confident. It shows that we've been working in the right direction all along.”\n\nThe mixed team of young sailors, aged between 18 and 25, is made up of six people: “A leader, Enzo, who is skipper and starboard pilot. He shares this role with Matisse, who is port pilot. Then there are the trimmers Gaultier, behind Matisse, and Théo behind Enzo,” explains Lou Mourniac. “As for Ange and I, we're substitute trimmers. We follow the sailing from the RIB with Alex Kovalski in charge of the data. Data analysis is a whole new world that we also have to get to grips with. It's very instructive and allows us to enrich our sailing to be even more efficient.”\n\nThe boat?\n\n“The AC40 is a great boat. Admittedly, 40 feet is big, but when you're on it, it's like a little go-kart. You can do whatever you want. It is very responsive. You can execute a manoeuvre in a matter of seconds so the tactics are open, and you can improvise,” described Enzo.\n\n“The slightest movement of the sails can upset the boat's stability, so you have to be very careful with the trimming,” added Lou. “As for speed, it's pretty dizzying. You must get to grips with it and keep a cool head on the water when you cross paths with the others. They're really beautiful machines.”\n\nWhat's next?\n\nLou: “Going fast is one thing. But going fast in a race is quite another. We can't wait to race against the other AC40s as much as possible!”\n\nEnzo: “We're about to enter the final phase of training, where we'll be able to officially take on the other Youth teams and gather valuable information. We'll be inspired by the others, and maybe they'll be inspired by us!”\n\nThe UniCredit Youth America's Cup has only six AC40s for 12 teams and will therefore require each team to lend its boat to the organisation to be shared with another team. The French will be sharing their AC40 with the Spanish. Training will end on the 26 August when the full AC40 fleet will be returned to the event organisation.\n\nAndoo Team Australia – Youth & Women’s Team Update\n\nThe Team Australia Challenge America’s Cup 2024 campaign has announced a Naming Rights partnership with Andoo, leading online destination for the entire home and home of feel-good living, to present Andoo Team Australia for the UniCredit Youth and Puig Women’s America’s Cup regattas in Barcelona starting in September.\n\nAndoo Team Australia is the latest high performance sailing team to carry the Andoo moniker, following the record setting super-maxi Andoo Comanche, achieving many sailing successes including line honours in the 2022 Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race and the Andoo 18ft Skiff Racing Team’s campaigns in the JJ Giltinan World Titles.\n\nTeam Australia Chair, Annick Donat, welcomed the sponsorship to boost the campaign in its final preparations to challenge in the 12 nation competitions only weeks away. “Andoo brings an impressive history of high-performance sailing which will enhance our campaign immensely.

Youth team athlete Jack Gogan shares his experience and insights from this exciting phase.\n\nAs soon as we caught wind of the possibility of getting out on an AC40—the foiling boat we’ll be using during the UniCredit Youth America’s Cup—the excitement was palpable. We had been logging serious hours on the simulator in anticipation, and the prospect of finally sailing was a huge motivator. The buildup was intense, with rigorous safety training and a gradual process of getting everyone on the boat. Initially, only one Canadian athlete would be on the boat at a time as we swapped out positions with the more established team, we were loaning the boat from. It felt like an endless progression of steps until we finally had the full team on board and Concord Pacific Racing finally set sail!\n\nThe transition wasn't without its challenges. The first few days were marked by a few technical issues, from foil malfunctions to mis-calibrated wind instruments. Despite these setbacks, our resilience shone through. The technical problems were a test of our patience and problem-solving skills. But each day, despite the hurdles, we learned something new and grew more comfortable with the boat.\n\nThe first time I got on the boat was incredibly thrilling. The speed and power were overwhelming. The boat was loud, and the sensation of foiling at high speeds was exhilarating. Despite the intense preparation, nothing could quite prepare us for the real thing. The physical sensation of the wind and the spray, combined with the sheer speed, made it clear why we put in so many hours of training. It's one thing to simulate it, but being out there, feeling the boat lift and accelerate, was beyond exciting.\n\nOne of the most surprising aspects of the transition was how well the simulation training translated to real-world sailing. I was amazed at how similar the experience was. The main differences were obviously the physical sensations, but technically, it felt very familiar. This similarity gave us confidence that our hard work on the simulator was paying off.\n\nDespite the initial nerves, our confidence grew with each sailing session. We've all put in long hours, and while there were nerves, knowing how much preparation we'd done was reassuring. The dynamic between team members became stronger as we adapted to each other's styles and techniques.\n\nOur on-water training primarily focused on boat handling, getting comfortable with various manoeuvres, and preparing for race conditions. Training in open water allowed us to practise as many manoeuvres as possible. One highlight was when one of the AC75s crossed just 50 metres behind us. Seeing those boats up close while sailing our own was surreal and incredibly motivating.\n\nIt was a stark contrast to earlier days when we would watch these big boats from the shore during our lunch breaks. Seeing them up close and personal on the water was an awe-inspiring experience. Every day we'd watch these guys out there, and now to be out on the same water, even if not directly lined up with them, felt like a significant step forward.\n\nWith our time on the boat sessions nearing an end, we are looking forward to a brief break before resuming intense preparations for the Unicredit Youth America’s Cup. Reflecting on the month, I feel optimistic and excited for the upcoming challenges. We've come a long way, and each day on the water has taught us so much. We're eager to take what we've learned back to the simulator and continue refining our skills. The next phase of preparation, especially the four intensive days before the regatta, will be crucial for our success.\n\nOutside of training, we have been enjoying our time in Barcelona. While I admit I'm not yet fluent in Spanish, the vibrant city life and the proximity of amenities have made our stay enjoyable. Team bonding activities, both professional and social, have been integral to maintaining a positive and cohesive team spirit. Barcelona has been fantastic. It's been a blend of hard work and making the most of our time in a beautiful city.\n\nAs we move closer to both the UniCredit Youth America’s Cup and the Puig Women’s America’s Cup, the Concord Pacific Racing team remains committed and focused. The transition from simulator to sea has been a significant milestone, and with continued dedication, we're confident in our ability to perform on the world stage. Thank you to all our partners and supporters for your unwavering support.\n\nAC Team Germany July Youth Team Update\n\nIn July, the ACTG team engaged in J70 Match Racing training on the scenic Alster in Hamburg, featuring both the Youth and Women's Teams. This training session was an excellent opportunity for the teams to refine their racing skills.\n\nThe team has now entered a critical phase, spending extensive hours in the simulator. These simulation sessions are designed to replicate real racing conditions, allowing team members to practice manoeuvres, test strategies, and improve their decision-making skills in a controlled environment. This intensive simulator training is crucial for enhancing performance and coordination on the water.\n\nSome team members also visited Barcelona, where they explored the new base in the Olympic Harbour. This visit offered practical insights and useful lessons that will benefit the entire team.\n\nLooking ahead, the team will focus on safety training, and the announcement of the Top 6 Team is scheduled for August 14th. These upcoming events are essential as the team continues to prepare for future challenges.\n\nAC Team Germany July Women’s Team Update\n\nIn July, part of the women's team from Germany travelled to Barcelona for an up-close experience with the AC40. They had the opportunity to observe teams conducting starting practices and manoeuvres around the course. This hands-on experience was invaluable compared to the simulator training they had previously undertaken. Additionally, they engaged in insightful conversations with experienced AC40 sailors, gaining a deeper understanding of what it will be like to sail an AC40 at speeds of 42 knots.\n\nThe Barcelona trip also marked the final team selection, with the chosen members announced as Carolina Werner, Tina Lutz, Luise Wanser, Jill Paland, Victoria Jurczok and Maru Scheel. Beyond the Barcelona experience, the team continued their training in Hamburg on the Alster, sailing with J70 boats. This team-building exercise, supported by coach Annie Lush, allowed the team to strengthen their collaboration on the water and build stronger interpersonal connections. Overall, July was a productive month for the team, filled with learning, team-building, and preparation for future challenges.\n\nSwedish Challenge – Youth & Women’s Team Update\n\nThe sensational news in early August for the Swedish Women's America's Cup Team was the stunning silver medal won by Vilma Bobeck and Rebecca Netzler in the 49erFX class at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Speaking afterwards, wrapped in the Swedish flag, Vilma proclaimed: \"We are so happy, proud but also totally empty. So much tension that we now can let go of, and today we really did all we could!\"\n\nMeanwhile, July has been an intense period for us with focus on the Youth team and with half of the Women’s team here we have been rotating with 2 sessions per sailing day. We have three women athletes in Marseille at the Olympics, all three with medal chance.\n\nIn total we have done 17 days on the water. With charging batteries and swapping them middle of the sailing session we have been able to push two sessions a day. The sailors not sailing have been looking at live stream on the sailing inside at the office and also mixed it up with practice in the simulator.\n\nAfter the Olympics we will welcome the full women’s team, and we look forward to that. We really enjoy the time here in beautiful Barcelona!\n\nSail Team BCN – Youth & Women’s Team Update\n\nTámara Echegoyen and Paula Barceló are competing in the Olympics in 49er FX.\n\nSilvia Mas has gone to Newport for the TP52 worlds, onboard Alegre.\n\nNeus Ballester went to the European of 470 in Greece.\n\nThe Youth team is sailing International Moths in different locations.\n\nWe moved our base from Port de Sitges to Real Club Naútico de Barcelona until our new base is built in Port Vell, expected to be finished middle August.\n\nSail Team BCN successfully complete first training onboard an AC40\n\nSail Team BCN, the team that will represent Spain in the UniCredit Youth and Puig Women's America's Cup, has completed its first training sessions onboard an AC40, the boat that will be used in the competition which will take place in Barcelona later this year.\n\nThe Spanish team chartered an AC40 from June to early July, during which they completed a total of ten training days. \"The truth is, it was the best investment we could have made, given that our budget doesn't allow us to own an AC40. The balance of these training days has been fantastic, and I am very proud of the performance of our sailors and their ability to adapt to the AC40,\" explains Ross Daniel, Team Director of Sail Team BCN.\n\nSince both the Youth and Women's teams had not previously had the opportunity to sail onboard an AC40, the training was progressive. Until now, the sailors have invested their training time sailing a GC32 and on an AC40 simulator. “The differences between the simulator and the real boat are significant, and they had to adapt the simulator targets to reality. The angles change from one scenario to another, and they have adapted very well to them. A small error on the AC40 is unforgiving, and it's fantastic how both the youth and women's teams have adapted to the real boat,” explains Mónica Azón, the team's coach.\n\nThe team completed ten training days which included the necessary safety training, learning the complex systems, and finally, sailing the boat. Initially, the Spanish team were accompanied onboard by experienced AC40 sailors, but progressed to sailing the AC40 independently, with all four spots occupied by the Spanish team.\n\nAlbert Torres, captain of Sail Team BCN youth team highlights the immense benefit they have gained from these training days. “The experience on the AC40 has been very positive, and we are very grateful to the team for providing us with these days. The previous work in the simulator helped us understand the processes, automate, and mechanize all the systems, and work on communication on board. This is a complex boat, entirely new to us; if one thing goes wrong, everything gets complicated, but we have proven to be a very cohesive team.”\n\nNow, the managers of Sail Team BCN are working to secure a few more training days onboard the AC40 before the official training sessions scheduled for September and October begin. “We need to finalize a sponsorship that is already well advanced to make this possible, but I hope we can make it happen in the coming days,” adds Ross Daniel.\n\nSail Team BCN's main sponsors are Foundation 0 and CaixaBank, and their partners include Port de Sitges, Highfield, Musto, BWA Yachting, Sailproof. The team represents the Real Club Naútico de Barcelona"
