        "text": "Metrograph and the Flaherty NYC Series present Miko Revereza’s Nowhere Near, the opening night film of “MAKA: Many Eyed Vessel,” Flaherty’s multi-part series taking place in various venues across New York, on Friday, November 17 In Theater. The screening will be followed by a discussion led by series programmers Emily Abi-Kheirs, Ha’aheo Auwae-Dekker, Isabel Rojas, and Raven Two Feathers.\n\nArriving at Metrograph for this special one-night-only screening event following its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and recent U.S. Premiere at New York Film Festival, Nowhere Near offers complicated and critical reflections on the filmmaker’s experience of home and self. The interconnected portrait of transition creates the doorway for the rest of the program.\n\nFeaturing works from artists around the world, this program is a curated response to the 2022 Flaherty Seminar, Continents of Drifting Clouds and the stirring reverberations that followed. With the intentions of nourishment, “MAKA: Many Eyed Vessel” reckons with the themes of its predecessor while navigating institutional spaces through its offerings of reflection, interconnection, and the future.\n\nABOUT FLAHERTY NYC\n\nFlaherty NYC takes place twice a year, in the spring and in the fall. The series, now in its 25th season, invites curators to assemble programs on a theme of their choice, featuring innovative, engaging, challenging, and groundbreaking films. The screenings are followed by discussions, often including the makers, about the work and the curatorial process. This is the sister series of the Flaherty Film Seminar, and in 2023 we are excited to expand beyond the physical venues in New York City to online audiences around the world. Learn more about the series at www.theflaherty.org\n\nA sincere thank you to our curatorial advisors and guides: Almudena Escobar-López and Sky Hopinka, 2022 Professional Development Fellow Angeline Gragasin, Poh Lin Lee of Narrative Imaginings, and our program partners at Humanities New York and the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs.\n\nWalton Ford has curated a selection of films as part of a series co-presented by Gagosian and Metrograph. The program features five films that explore extreme psychological states in their storylines and use pioneering and sometimes unconventional acting and cinematographic techniques to achieve the result.\n\nFord explains,“These films dive deep into characters in ways that are sometimes harrowing and always completely surprising. None of these films are cliché or pat, and all share an unorthodox style or method. As a narrative painter, I seek to explore subjects and tell stories in this way.”\n\nPre-screening discussion between artist Walton Ford and designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia on Friday, November 19th\n\nPresented with Gagosian"
