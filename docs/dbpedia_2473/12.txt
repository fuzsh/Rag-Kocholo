Jo Van Fleet (December 30, 1914 â€“ June 10, 1996) was an American theater and film actress.

Born in Oakland, California, Van Fleet established herself as a notable dramatic actress on Broadway over several years, winning a Tony Award in 1954 for her role in Horton Foote's The Trip to Bountiful with Lillian Gish and Eva Marie Saint.

Her first film role, as the mother of the James Dean character in East of Eden (1955), brought her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her subsequent film work was very sporadic, and included such films as The Rose Tattoo, I'll Cry Tomorrow (both 1955), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) and Cool Hand Luke (1967).

She died in Queens, New York.
