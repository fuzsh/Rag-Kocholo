        "text": "I recently got a copy of the Guiding Light 60th Anniversary issue of Soap Opera Digest Jan. 28, 1997. Here’s part of the Where Are They Now section.\n\n“Elissa Leeds, who soap-hopped from AW to GL in the 1960s as Hope Bauer is now a successful talent manager….Leeds‘s last soap assignment was playing GH’s Steffi in 1984…..[A] back injury that landed her ‘home and horizontal’ made Leeds rethink her vocation. “I thought it’s be interested to handle actors that way I felt they might want to be handled, ” she explains.”\n\n“A typical week for Leeds includes suggesting clients for roles, reading scripts, meeting studio execs and even turning down work. ‘Occasionally, we’ll pass on a part – either because of the material or because the project is not right for a particular client,’ she says. One role that was ‘not right’ for Leeds herself was AMC’s Brooke English, a character she created in 1976. Julia Barr assumed the role after the writers made Brooke…um…sexually active. ‘It truly needed to be done,’ Leeds reflects. ‘I wasn’t at an age where I was comfortable with where they were taking the character.’ Leeds credits her level-headed parents with keeping their child actress on a steady course. ‘The rules were: Schools can’t suffer, no personality changes, and it has to be fun,’ she recalls ‘If any of that altered it was over.’ Now that she and her film executive husband, Andy are expecting their first child (a son)….’I loved acting and I wouldn’t trade my experiences for anything. But I think I’m a much better manager than I was an actress.’\n\nLeeds was Hope Bauer #2 and played Hope on Another World from March 25, 1966 to June 30, 1966 and on Guiding Light, December 1968 to December 31, 1973. Leeds‘s time as Hope was before I was alive & watching, but anyone who played Hope has a special place in my heart. Hope and Alan were a wonderful couple and still one of my all time favorites. In 2017, Leeds is still listed as President of Reel Talent Management. http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elissa-leeds/35/b86/560\n\nUPDATED September 3 2017: I checked and Leeds is still listed on as the President and I updated the note. I found and linked to an image I believe is hers. I also included my current signature block."
