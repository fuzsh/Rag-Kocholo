        "text": "You may have heard the term deus ex machina in reference to a book, play, or movie. But what does it mean, and where does it come from? Keep reading to learn about the history of deus ex machina and see how it applies to several examples in literature.\n\nChoosing great read-aloud chapter books for first graders can bridge the gap between picture books and novels. Six through eight-year-olds have all the imagination and energy of younger kids, but are starting to read well on their own too. As parents and teachers encourage independent reading, itâ€™s easy to forget how reading aloud with these kids is still beneficial."
