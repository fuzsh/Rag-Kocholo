        "text": "We founded the Brooke Mattapan Campus one year after a legislative lift to the Massachusetts charter cap in 2010. Our vision for this school is the same vision that has led to excellent results at the original Brooke school: quality teaching in bigger doses. We currently serve 580 students across grades kindergarten through eight.\n\nBrooke Mattapan is a community of educators, scholars, and families who are all committed to high academic achievement. Our instruction is scholar-focused, urgent, rigorous, engaging, and inspires active participation in learning.\n\nI am inspired daily by being a part of the Brooke Mattapan community because of the incredibly strong commitment each teacher has to becoming the best they can be. Everyone here believes that continuing to learn, grow, and improve is the best way to ensure we are giving 100% of our students the type of education they deserve.\n\nAbby Waldman Principal, Brooke Mattapan\n\nAs a K-8 school, Brooke Mattapan scholars start school at 7:45am promptly and are dismissed at 4pm on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Our scholars have an 12:20pm early dismissal on Wednesday. The school year calendar for Brooke Mattapan can be viewed below:\n\n2024-2025 Calendar"
