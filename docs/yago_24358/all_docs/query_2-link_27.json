        "text": "You should consider enrolling your child at Brooke if you are looking for a productive, joyful classroom where great teachers nurture and hold every single scholar to high expectations.\n\nNot only do we support student learning through small class sizes, rigorous academics, longer school days and years, consistent school uniforms, and nightly homework, but – above all – our model prioritizes great teaching.\n\nWe strive to create classrooms where each Brooke staff member would be proud to send our own children, where teachers know and challenge every individual student and forge strong relationships with families, and where we uphold a Culture of Achievement, which encourages students to identify as scholars and love learning.\n\nCollege isn't something easy. You need to have patience and pride in what you’re learning, and you need to take it seriously because it affects your future. Right now I’m working on my grades. It isn't just a number, it’s my education and how I will live my life and be somebody.\n\nJosh Vilarson Brooke High School Class of 2024"
