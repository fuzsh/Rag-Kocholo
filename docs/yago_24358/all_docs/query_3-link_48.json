        "text": "Please Note: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) defines a child as everyone under 18. In New Zealand certain freedoms come at age 18, but a child or ‘minor’ is not considered to have reached the ‘age of majority’ until they turn 20 [Age of Majority Act 1970]. Therefore those under 20 years of age are included in this list.\n\nThere is no sense to the killing of our children, and each case seems slightly different, but these children have been failed by us all. My heart broke while adding the over 300 profiles to this project with the knowledge that more would come, and that right now, somewhere in Aotearoa New Zealand, a child is being hurt and no one is hearing their cries – or someone else is ignoring them. I wonder at the sentences handed out for the deaths; I wonder if children are seen as ‘less’ than adults as they have been in the past when babies and some children were operated on without anesthetic. For if some of the horrific injuries that I have read about had been inflicted upon an adult, I suspect the penalties would be much harsher. And yes, I can state two things right now, I would rather see a baby aborted then suffer days, weeks, months or years of abuse before being murdered. I would rather see a child wrongly taken from his or her family than read about another little life filled with horror, fear and pain. I feel for those at the ‘front lines’ – damned if they do, damned if they don’t. We cannot see into the future, but we can realise how terribly hard the job of parenting is and help become the ‘village’ that is needed to give parents a break and help raise all of our beautiful children in an atmosphere of safety and love.\n\nA baby hatch (foundling wheel) was historically a place in a hospital or social centre where a baby (usually newborn) could be anonymously placed where they would be safe and cared for. Nowadays the flaps open onto soft warmed beds and a sensor alerts helpers to collect the baby. Apparently in Germany a mother can return and reclaim her baby within eight weeks with no legal repercussions. If unclaimed, the baby will be put up for adoption. These hatches are in many countries around the world, but not in New Zealand where it is quite obvious from our terrible record of child deaths that we need them. Let us be more humanitarian and less judgmental and provide options for those who are not coping with the 24/7-hour job of parenting. Remember the thousands of damaged and abused children who have survived, but will carry their physical and mental scars into adulthood and need help to not perpetuate the cycle. Any hospitals due for upgrade could be fitted with a baby hatch, and in just a few years all would have one.\n\nAnother thing that must be looked at is levelling the playing field. When I first started this project, I wrote; Aotearoa New Zealand is a South Pacific paradise for some, but the program of neoliberal economic restructuring (aka Rogernomics) during the 1980’s and since has had devastating effects on the children of New Zealand and resulted in increasing levels of social inequality, teen suicide, child poverty, child abuse and child deaths. Creating a ‘robust economy’ via free-market reforms put economic growth above the safety and welfare of our children. The infamous ‘trickle-down’ theory that reducing the tax burden on the wealthy will prompt them to invest more in the economy, leading to increased wealth for all has been proved absolute rubbish. Those at the top of the economic ladder who express shock and horror at the latest child murder do not seem to want to examine the role they themselves are playing in an unfair and unjust society. For to examine too closely might mean they have to give up their yearly (environmentally insane) overseas holiday – or the ones they are now planning post-Covid (if there ever is a post-Covid). They would have to ensure that the wage ratio in their companies of CEO to lowest-paid worker is no more than 20 times or less. I view the yearly Rich List’s as Lists of Shame, for that exorbitant money is always made by somehow taking it off others. People should not have to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet, and the rich donating to charitable causes to assuage the guilt of absurd profits is not the way forward. Lets create a society where those charitable causes have no reason to exist and every child has a safe place to sleep at night. Level the playing field and we might just have a chance of fixing the problems and saving our children, but it might take another thirty years or so of hard work, less selfishness and a lot more empathy to do so.\n\nPlease note: The names below link to their profile on Geni where more information can be found.

Tyla-Maree lived on a poultry farm on Puriri Road, north of Tokoroa. She and her two siblings were being looked after by their stepfather Whiti Te Rau Hopa (aka Rikki Hotham) on 28 June 2007 while her mother Lisa Barron was out. It was during this time, medical experts told police, that Tyla-Maree was “immersed face-first in a vessel of water” receiving severe burns on her face, shoulders, torso and back. Medical experts and police also believe Whiti inflicted burns consistent with cigarette marks on the toddler’s genitals, inner knee and neck, which were “extremely unlikely to be accidental”. The back of her head was also bruised. When her mother Lisa Barron saw Tyla-Maree the following morning, 16 hours after she had been burned, she rushed her horrifically injured child to Tokoroa Hospital. Tyla-Maree died an hour later from a secondary lung infection and septicaemia. Whiti was charged with the murder of Tyla-Maree on 8 April 2008. He was released on bail. Whiti was on the wrong side of the road overtaking a truck when his car ploughed head-on into a four-wheel-drive vehicle driven by Auckland mother Angela Eliza Wolley, on State Highway 1, near Tokoroa on 18 October 2008. Both died at the scene. Tyla-Maree was buried at Wharerangi Lawn Cemetery in Napier.

The radio at 13d Frank Street at Koutu in Rotorua was turned up loud so the neighbours wouldn’t hear the screams and cries of three-year-old Nia Maria Glassie. Her death remains one of the most horrific and high-profile child murders in Aotearoa New Zealand. Nia was malnourished and had suffered months of persistent and violent abuse at the hands of several adults. For the main perpetrators, Wiremu and Michael Curtis, abusing Nia was a way to entertain themselves while Lisa worked as a kiwifruit picker in Te Puke. Nia had been dropped into an ice-cold bath then put in a clothes dryer spinning for 30 minutes on a hot setting, hung on a clothesline and spun around until she flew off, held over a burning fire, used to practice wrestling moves, folded into a couch and sat upon, shoved into piles of rubbish and cold baths, dragged half naked through a sandpit, thrown at walls and dropped from heights, and had various objects hurled at her. She was also kicked, slapped, beaten, jumped on and left outside naked in freezing temperatures. On Michael Curtis’ 21st birthday in July 2007, Nia suffered repeated kicks to the head. Lisa found Nia had wet her bed, and despite her being unresponsive, bathed her. She then spent the night partying with the other adults. The following day, Sunday 22 July, Lisa finally took Nia to Rotorua Hospital as she was suffering convulsions. Nia was flown to Auckland’s Starship Hospital with critical head injuries. She was put on life support but died 13 days later on 3 August 2007. If her brain injury hadn’t been left untreated for 36 hours, doctors say she would likely have survived. A jury found the Curtis brothers guilty of Nia’s murder. Lisa was convicted of two counts of manslaughter – one for failing to provide Nia the necessaries of life and the other for failing to protect the child from violence, thereby causing her death. Pearson and Kemp were found not guilty of manslaughter but convicted of assaulting the little girl. William Curtis, father of the Curtis brothers, was charged with assault on a child and injuring with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He is said to have wrapped a scarf twice around the 3-year-old’s neck, then lifted her off the ground and strangled her with it until she was purple, as well as slapping her and pushing her over or into a wall. A neighbour had seen Nia being swung on the clothesline, but failed to take any action, nor when she had been placed on the roof of the house and was seen screaming. Nia’s battered and broken body was laid to rest in Tokoroa Cemetery (3 years).\n\n2007 September 24 Jyniah Mary Pearl Te Awa Tortured and killed by babysitter Tiana Mary-Anne Odessa Kapea.

She was held against a gas heater, hung on a clothesline, swung around by her hair, hung on the back of a wardrobe door and shut in a closed freezer several times. The severe brain injuries that would kill her were a result of being kicked, thrown against a wall, shaken and smothered. Jyniah was taken from Manurewa to Middlemore Hospital then transferred to Starship Hospital where she died. In 2018 Jyniah’s father Ike Mokohoria Te Awa was jailed for the long-term physical and sexual abuse of two young children (10 months).\n\n2008 January 1 Tahani Mahomed Tortured and killed by parents Azees Mahomed and Tabbasum Mahomed.

When their car left the road just south of Kahutara School on 16 January 2008 it went into a “barrel roll” for 18m before taking out a concrete post and stopping 71m from the point of impact. Konrad had been thrown through the front windscreen and about 30m and was found in the long-grassed paddock about 20 minutes after the crash.

Marie was not found until 12 days later. Dean had been out of jail for only nine months and had a lengthy list of previous convictions including sexual violation and violence, and breaches of protection orders (15 years).\n\n2008 April 18 Dylan Hohepa Tonga Rimoni Killed by foster mother Patricia Angela Pickering. Dylan was abused, neglected and slept in a beer crate while in the care of his birth mother Jasmine Tonga. He was fostered by Patricia and her husband Douglas Hoeta in around April 2007 and lived with them at Drury in Auckland. An autopsy after Dylan’s death would reveal old injuries received at Patricia’s hands including head injuries, a broken foot, broken rib, a scar on one buttock, and a pattern of unusual bruising and scarring along with evidence of methamphetamine in his system. On 16 April 2008 Patricia slammed Dylan’s head brutally against doors and walls. Investigators would later find Dylan’s blood stains throughout the house, including on the bathroom door and in his bedroom. Dylan suffered massive head trauma that caused his brain to bleed and swell so badly that it was squeezed down into his brain stem. He also sustained a fractured leg, toe and rib, and bruising to his face. Patricia played internet poker while Dylan lay injured and dying, assuming that he would just recover from the assault as he had done after previous beatings. Hours later Patricia called an ambulance and Dylan was rushed to Starship Hospital where he died two days later from his head injury. “This child was beaten for a long time. He was hit, cut and maltreated over the period he was in Ms Pickering’s care” said Philip Hamlin (3 years).\n\n2008 May 26 Baby Girl Unidentified [twin] Killed by mother [name suppression].

Duwayne lived at Fergusson Street in Stoke, Nelson where he sustained “systematic torture” from stepfather Johnny while his mother did nothing. Six weeks before he died Duwayne sustained three broken ribs after a beating from Johnny. On 24 June, eight days before his death, Duwayne failed to bring his jersey home from school. This enraged Johnny who beat Duwayne so badly that he became partially paralysed and incontinent and was fitted with nappies as he slowly suffocated on the blood being inhaled into his lungs. Johnny tried to fix this by “exercises” in which he repeatedly punched Duwayne in the stomach to make him vomit up blood. The paralysis to the left side of Duwayne’s body had been caused by repeated kicks to the right side of his head causing a subdural haemorrhage and stroke. For the kicks to his head, legs and upper body Johnny wore his leather shoes with heavy soles. There were also 10 deep bruises on Duwayne’s scalp. In another attempt to “shock” Duwayne into movement, Johnny thrust his paralysed foot into boiling water, leaving the largest of four scald wounds on his right leg and a blistered foot. Frustrated that Duwayne still could not move, Johnny threw him against walls and a wardrobe. Over 75 extra bruises were found on Duwayne’s body as a result of being hit, kicked and struck repeatedly on the hands and soles of his feet with a wooden cricket wicket. Duwayne was dead by the time Johnny finally called an ambulance (7 years).\n\n2008 August 12 John Xavier Andrew Hapeta ‘John-John’ Killed by Nathan Tuiti Reo Mutunga Williams and Daniel Bobby Tumata.

From around five days before her death Hail-Sage was in a lethargic state, constantly vomiting and showing her mother that she wasn’t well by rubbing her head. Over this time the normally agile toddler had a number of falls, dried blood was found in one of her ears, she had a persistent cough, and the vomiting continued. Kelly and Adrian were too busy playing pokies and drinking to take her to the doctor, and in doing so failed to provide the necessities of life – namely medical attention.

Karl hit his side on the edge of a coffee table causing two broken ribs in his back which punctured his lung and caused bleeding in his chest cavity. Rikki then put Karl on the toilet and left him there while he played video games in his bedroom. Karl managed to get himself off the toilet but had stuffed the toilet bowl with paper and was trailing unravelled toilet paper when he left the bathroom. From the bed, Rikki sent Karl flying with a roundhouse style kick to the stomach, injuring his bowel, lacerating his intestine and causing internal bleeding.
