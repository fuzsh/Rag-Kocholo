        "text": "Public Domain Mark 1.0\n\n***Created by Agnes Nixon in 1969 for 1970+ viewing, All my Children was a 41 Year long, Groundbreaking, Daytime Emmy Winning, Television Drama.\n\n1985 Storylines: (Unknown source)\n\nErica, whom is in love with Mike (now a respected journalism professor at Pine Valley University), continues to be harassed by an obsessed Adam. TV anchorwoman Brooke English was sent to prison for not revealing a source in a municipal scandal she exposed. After getting out of prison, Brooke and her fiance Mark went to a party where a henchman of the corrupt judge tried to shoot them. Mike took the bullet instead and Erica spoke swore their long delayed wedding vows over the body just as he died.\n\nErica took a job as editor of Tempo Magazine. A handsome man named Jeremy Hunter came to Erica to do some art work for the magazine. Unbeknownst to Erica, Jeremy had been sent there from Tibet.\n\nAn aspiring singer named Yvonne Caldwell, whom Jesse sang duets with, became romantically interested in him. Jesse's no-good half-brother Eugene conspired with Yvonne to break Jesse and Angie up. They nearly succeeded when Yvonne lured Jesse into her bed and saw to it that Angie discovered every dirty detail of their short-lived liaison.\n\nAngie eventually forgave Jesse for his indiscretion, but not before she became embroiled in a potentially scandalous situation of her own. One of her med school professors, Dr. John Voight, a married man, tried to take advantage of Angie by suggesting that she could improve her grades by having an affair with him. Angie reported the sexual harassment to her hospital superiors, resulting in Dr. Voight's dismissal. Eventually, Jesse and Angie resolved their marital problems.\n\nTragedy struck Pine Valley in 1985, when Joe Martin's mother, \"Grandma\" Kate died peacefully in her sleep. She was deeply mourned by everyone, and eulogized by her son, Dr. Joe Martin.\n\nFinally over Chuck Tyler, Donna married Benny Sago. The ceremony was marred by a distressed and deeply disturbed Nina Cortlandt Warner, who mistakenly believed Donna was responsible for her mother Daisy's unhappiness. Secretly carrying a gun into the wedding, Nina tried to shoot Donna -- and missed! Obviously deranged, Nina was sent off to a mental hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Palmer was embroiled in a romantic game of his own. After a whirlwind courtship, Palmer married the money-hungry Cynthia Preston. Daisy saw right through Cynthia's charade, and in time, so did Palmer, who grew increasingly disenchanted with his new wife. But he grew to love her son, Andrew Preston. He took the handsome lad under his wing, adopting him. Palmer eventually divorced Cynthia and tried desperately to win back Daisy.\n\nTo get away from his frustrating romance with Erica, Jeremy (who had taken a vow of celibacy) went to his father's home in Canada. Jeremy's father Alex was married to a much younger woman named Natalie. She was a beautiful blonde, full of life and full of passion. Erica invited Natalie, Alex and Jeremy to come and live in her house in Pine Valley. In time, Erica was heartbroken to find out Jeremy and Natalie had a romantic past -- and she wanted him back at any cost. To get rid of her husband, Natalie figured she could seduce the weak-hearted Alex Hunter, to his death.\n\n**** I own zero rights to the above 1985 STORYLINES, as they were a kind gesture from a 'like' AMC fan. I did not pen the above STORYTELLING, I only (many years ago) copied them to disc to save for this very purpose for-which I have used them. Should anyone recall name of writer, please inform me (in the 'reviews' below), so that I may then thank her for her written work.\n\n** During 1985, several well known actors, etc.... guest starred on AMC including Juliet Mills (British Movie Actor), who played the part of Judge Edith Hogan, actor Jade D. Bari, in the role of jail inmate, M.J. Martel, and on March 18, 1985 (Ep unavailable), the episode of All My Children included a scene in-which Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) met and became friends with, Stephen J. Cannell, (writer, creator, and producer of drama shows The A-Team, Riptide, Hunter, and Wiseguy). Tune in, for many future guest stars!\n\n1985 SYNOPSIS (**which is owned in its entirety, by abc television **)\n\nEveryone in PINE VALLEY had a reason to kill Zach Grayson, a sleazy ex-hustler/con artist who ingratiated himself with whomever he could blackmail, or otherwise harm. One night, Ross Chandler found Zach dead in his apartment. And sooooo arises the question ...WHO KILLED ZACH GRAYSON??\n\n** I own zero rights to the above 1985 Synopsis which is written and owned in its entirety, by abc.com, as noted on web page: â€¦ Thank you, abc television, for taking on the project of making these story lines available to us, the general public. **\n\n** I also own ZERO RIGHTS (FINANCIALLY OR OTHERWISE) to any of these wonderful AMC episodes, Promos, etc., and I have uploaded them here in the Internet Archive, for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, for current and future generations to get a fairly clear view of just how, some human beings behaved/acted, during the year 1985.\n\nEnjoy!!
