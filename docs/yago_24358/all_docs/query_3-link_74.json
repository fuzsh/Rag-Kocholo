        "text": "#50. Eric Braeden\n\nTotal nominations: 8\n\nTotal wins: 1\n\nStacker score: 19.23\n\nEric Braeden has been playing the great Victor Newman on The Young and the Restless for 38 years and counting. As Victor, Braeden is one of the genre’s greatest villains and heroes; a self-made tycoon capable of unthinkable evil grounded by a tempestuous love story with ex-stripper Nikki Newman.\n\n#49. Kimberly McCullough\n\nTotal nominations: 6\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 19.23\n\nChild actors who join soap operas generally know that their time on the show is limited due to the genre's time-honored tradition of \"soap opera rapid aging syndrome\" or \"SORAS.\" Kimberly McCullough is the exception to the rule. She joined General Hospital as Robin Scorpio at age 7, and has continued playing the role on and off ever since, even winning a Daytime Emmy for a heartrending story about her teen character contracting HIV.\n\n#48. Jess Walton\n\nTotal nominations: 6\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 19.23\n\nJess Walton is the third actress to play Jill Fenmore on The Young and the Restless, but there’s no doubt that she made the rags to riches, social climbing executive her own. However, it’s impossible to mention Jill without discussing Katherine Chancellor. The women's volatile onscreen feud lasted until Walton’s scene partner, Jeanne Cooper, passed away in 2013.\n\n#47. Julie Marie Berman\n\nTotal nominations: 4\n\nTotal wins: 3\n\nStacker score: 19.23\n\nThere is no daytime TV couple more famous than General Hospital’s Luke and Laura, and Julie Marie Berman played their only daughter, Lulu Spencer from 2005-2013. During that time, Lulu became the first character in the show’s history to have an abortion.\n\n#46. Chandler Massey\n\nTotal nominations: 4\n\nTotal wins: 3\n\nStacker score: 19.23\n\nChandler Massey broke down a major barrier for Days of Our Lives with his beautiful performance as Will Horton, an openly gay young man. Massey took home the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series three years in a row (2012-2014) and became the first actor to receive a Daytime Emmy for playing a gay character.\n\n#45. Elizabeth Hubbard\n\nTotal nominations: 9\n\nTotal wins: 1\n\nStacker score: 21.15\n\nAlthough she’s most famous for playing Lucinda Walsh on As the World Turns — a role that netted her eight Daytime Emmy nominations — Elizabeth Hubbard is one of daytime’s most prolific stars. In addition to As the World Turns, she also had roles on Guiding Light, The Edge of Night, The Doctors, One Life to Live, and the Swedish soap Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden.\n\n#44. Steve Burton\n\nTotal nominations: 7\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 21.15\n\nAs General Hospital’s Jason Morgan, Steve Burton is a stoic, action hero who has been through it all — amnesia, a memory-mapping experiment, murder cover-ups, and dalliances with the mob. The character’s two constants are his passionate fanbase, and his ongoing love story with con woman turned private investigator, Sam McCall.\n\n#43. Meredith Vieira\n\nTotal nominations: 7\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 21.15\n\nSince 1992, there hasn’t really been a time when Meredith Vieira wasn’t a part of the daytime television landscape. She went from balancing hard news stories and fluff pieces on NBC’s Today Show to serving as the original moderator for The View, to hosting the recently canceled Meredith Vieira Show, and Vieira remains one of the most trusted names in news.\n\n#42. Jerry verDorn\n\nTotal nominations: 7\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 21.15\n\nBefore some of the genre’s longest-running shows began to fall victim to network cancellations, Jerry verDorn was a permanent fixture in the daytime landscape. For more than 26 years the actor starred as Ross Marler on Guiding Light, before joining One Life to Live as Clint Buchanan from 2005-2013.\n\n#41. Dr. Mehmet Oz\n\nTotal nominations: 7\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 21.15\n\nThe world was first introduced to Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2004 on The Oprah Winfrey Show. It didn't take long for his unique way of dispensing medical advice to earn the doctor his own series, The Dr. Oz Show.\n\nYou may also like: Best Emmy-nominated shows of all time\n\n#40. Sarah Joy Brown\n\nTotal nominations: 5\n\nTotal wins: 3\n\nStacker score: 21.15\n\nSarah Joy Brown originated the role of General Hospital’s Carly Corinthos, a ruthless femme fatale with a taste for revenge.

Gina Tognoni\n\nTotal nominations: 5\n\nTotal wins: 3\n\nStacker score: 21.15\n\nGina Tognoni’s soap career began on One Life to Live when she took on the role of troubled teen Kelly Cramer. Soon the actress transitioned into more adult roles, first as Guiding Light’s complicated Dinah Marler, and more recently as the mostly-reformed bad girl Phyllis Summers on The Young and the Restless.\n\n#37. Jeanne Cooper\n\nTotal nominations: 10\n\nTotal wins: 1\n\nStacker score: 23.08\n\nJeanne Cooper was without a doubt the grande dame of the soap world. During her 40 years playing Katherine Chancellor on The Young and the Restless, Cooper had her 1984 facelift written into the story, proudly portrayed Katherine’s alcoholism as an ongoing struggle, and took part in a bitter rivalry with Jill Fenmore. While she passed away in 2013, Cooper was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Daytime Emmys in 2004.\n\n#36. Nancy Lee Grahn\n\nTotal nominations: 8\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 23.08\n\nIf you need a heroine with a strong sense of justice for your soap, then Nancy Lee Grahn is the person to call. First, she played the determined lawyer Julia Wainwright Capwell on Santa Barbara, before moving on to the equally fierce princess turned lawyer, Alexis Davis, on General Hospital.\n\n#35. Martha Byrne\n\nTotal nominations: 8\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 23.08\n\nOn As the World Turns, Martha Byrne starred as Lily Walsh, one half of the soap’s hallmark couple, Lily and Holden. But while her role as good girl Lily made her famous, taking on the role of Lily’s less scrupulous long-lost twin sister Rose solidified Byrne’s place in daytime TV history.\n\n#34. Larry Bryggman\n\nTotal nominations: 8\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 23.08\n\nFrom 1969-2004, Larry Bryggman starred as Dr. John Dixon on As the World Turns, a man with a working-class background and a major chip on his shoulder. He may have been one of the town’s most gifted doctors, but he was seldom a man who could be described as good.\n\n#33. Julia Barr\n\nTotal nominations: 8\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 23.08\n\nIt’s not easy to be a scene-stealer when your primary scene partner is Susan Lucci, but Julia Barr more than held her own as Erica Kane’s archrival Brooke English on All My Children.\n\n#32. Ellen DeGeneres\n\nTotal nominations: 4\n\nTotal wins: 4\n\nStacker score: 23.08\n\nEllen DeGeneres is a true trailblazer in the world of daytime talk shows. The comedian effortlessly transitioned from primetime actress to host in 2003. Since then, The Ellen DeGeneres Show has broken The Oprah Winfrey Show’s record number of Best Daytime Talk Show wins, while DeGeneres has gone on to show that there’s no end to her charity. In celebration of her 60th birthday, DeGeneres recently gave a special audience $1 million dollars.\n\n#31. Wayne Brady\n\nTotal nominations: 9\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 25.00\n\nFor four seasons, comedian Wayne Brady was the host of his own daytime chat show, The Wayne Brady Show.

Rick Hearst\n\nTotal nominations: 7\n\nTotal wins: 3\n\nStacker score: 25.00\n\nOver the course of his career, Rick Hearst has appeared on five different soaps: Days of Our Lives, Guiding Light, The Young and the Restless, The Bold and the Beautiful, and most recently, General Hospital.

Knight\n\nTotal nominations: 7\n\nTotal wins: 3\n\nStacker score: 25.00\n\nThere are a precious few truly “good” characters in the world of soaps, but Michael E. Knight’s Tad Martin is one of the genre’s true heroes. Knight played the character off and on from 1982 until All My Children ended in 2011, becoming a soap legend in the process.\n\n#26. Ben Bailey\n\nTotal nominations: 7\n\nTotal wins: 3\n\nStacker score: 25.00\n\nGame shows are a familiar part of the daytime TV landscape, but there's only one that takes place inside of a New York taxi cab.

Michelle Stafford\n\nTotal nominations: 10\n\nTotal wins: 2\n\nStacker score: 26.92\n\nMichelle Stafford originated the role of Phyllis Summers on The Young and the Restless in 1994.

Regis Philbin\n\nTotal nominations: 6\n\nTotal wins: 4\n\nStacker score: 26.92\n\nThanks to Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee (and later Live! with Regis and Kelly) Regis Philbin was the undeniable face of daytime talk shows from 1988 to 2011.
