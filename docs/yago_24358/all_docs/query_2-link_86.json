        "text": "There is a scene late in Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields in which Shields’s own teenage daughters speak for the audience that has been watching this intimate, unflinching look back at their mother’s child stardom. “I understand it was okay once, but now it’s just different,” Shields’s 16-year-old daughter, Grier, says of her mother’s breakthrough film, Pretty Baby, in which an 11-year-old Shields played a prostitute at an early-1900s brothel. Now, adds 19-year-old Rowan, “it’s called child pornography.”\n\nThe 1978 Louis Malle film gives Lana Wilson’s documentary its title, and presents a question that the film finds much more difficult to answer than Shields’s daughters do. How do we grapple now with the fame Shields achieved as a child, filming a kissing scene with a grown man (Keith Carradine) before she’d had a first kiss of her own, and shooting 1980’s Blue Lagoon mostly in the nude? And maybe more importantly, how does Shields herself grapple with it?\n\nWhat Wilson saw in the almost 50-year arc of Shields’s career, as she says on this week’s Little Gold Men podcast, “was someone going from being an object to being a human being.” The expansive film, which will debut in two parts on Hulu on April 3, devotes its first hour to Shields’s childhood fame, which made her a cultural monolith in a way that’s almost impossible to understand now. And though Shields now acknowledges the problems with the way she was presented onscreen, she is consistent throughout the documentary about how positive her on-set experiences were.\n\nThrough seeing European art films like Jules and Jim with her mother, Shields learned not to have hang-ups around sexuality from an early age, she says. Though she “may not have understood all the nuance,” Shields says in the doc, she considered Pretty Baby “a real artistic venture.” And given her mother’s struggles with alcoholism, Shields says, “being on a movie set was the safest place I could be, emotionally.”\n\nWilson’s film matches Shields’s refusal to condemn this early work, or to rest easy knowing that something like Pretty Baby or even Shields’s controversial Calvin Klein ad campaign wouldn’t be made today. Watching Shields’s talk show appearances alongside her mother, Wilson says,\n\n“I saw this little girl basically on the hot seat being grilled by these talk show hosts who would first praise her for her beauty and her sensuality and her maturity, but then also would criticize her for being an exhibitionist…I thought, This is a situation that a lot of women and girls still have to navigate, and often privately. But here’s Brooke Shields at age 12, having to deal with all this publicly. I just had this moment of feeling like this is incredibly contemporary.”\n\nExperts like Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Jean Kilbourne weigh in throughout the film, speaking about the broader cultural forces that shaped Shields’s fame, such as the backlash to the 1970s women’s movement that made the sexualization of young girls suddenly palatable. There are also interviews with friends like Laura Linney and Drew Barrymore (interviewed barefoot, of course), who know a thing or two about how fame can warp a young brain. But Shields—interviewed by Wilson over the course of four days—is the primary voice in the film, and it’s her lack of easy answers about her very unusual childhood that gives the film a probing power. “I know this industry, it’s predicated on eating its young,” she tells a friend in the film. “I try to learn from my experience and protect my girls now, and I don’t know exactly how to do it.”\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s Little Gold Men podcast now.\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall.
