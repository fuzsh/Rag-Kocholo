        "text": "Charlie Sheen says his sons are “grateful” for the way he is handling their mom Brooke Mueller’s addiction battle.\n\nThe “Two and a Half Men” star — who shares 14-year-old twins Max and Bob with his ex-wife — revealed he’s remaining “present” for his sons while the actress tries “to figure some stuff out on her end.”\n\n“The boys are proud of me, now. They see what mom goes through, and I’m not dumping on mom because I know it’s a thing,” he told People last month.\n\n“But I think they’re super grateful that they have a Dad that is present, accounted for, responsible, focused, punctual.”\n\nSheen, 58, and Mueller, 46, have recently re-hashed the agreement of their child custody conditions, which is dependent upon her sobriety.\n\nDocuments obtained by Page Six on Jan. 19 revealed the actor will be granted emergency “sole legal custody” of the teenagers “in the event Brooke tests positive for drugs or alcohol.”\n\nMueller will undergo tests for “drugs and alcohol as often as required by her probation officer” and “within 24 hours of a written request (email or text) from Charlie or his attorney,” the documents read.\n\nDrug tests are required to be submitted at least once a week, and if she tests positive or misses a test, her custody rights will be terminated immediately.\n\nThe couple agreed to the terms above in November 2022 and August 2023, but the new filing allows Sheen to file an ex parte motion, which allows the conditions to be permitted without a response from his ex.\n\nIn August 2023, Mueller signed the custody modification shortly before she “relapsed and engaged in abusing alcohol and controlled substances.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nPage Six exclusively revealed in December 2023 that Mueller enrolled in a 12-step program to help her get clean.\n\nAt the time, an insider told us the program was really “working for her.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sheen celebrated six years of sobriety this month.\n\nIn an interview with People in December, the “Anger Management” star explained his new daily routine since getting clean.\n\nHe referred to himself as a “single dad,” who wakes up at around 5 a.m. every morning to get work done before helping his sons get ready for school.\n\n“I have a very consistent lifestyle now,” he continued.\n\nSheen filed for divorce from Mueller in 2010 after tying the knot only two years before."
