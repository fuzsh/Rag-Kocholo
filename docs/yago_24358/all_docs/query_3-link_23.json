        "text": "Since 1999, I have visited Paris too many times to count – falling in love with it a little more each time. So, after much tireless research, here is my beginner’s guide to Paris. I am not going to write about the tourist destinations such as La Tour Eiffel, Champs-Élysées, l’Arc de Triomphe, because no-doubt you are going to visit those places anyway. Instead, I am giving you a few less touristy options that you can weave into your visit, and perhaps catch a glimpse of the Paris I’ve come to adore.\n\nMy Paris\n\nParis is my favourite city in the world – hands down. But it wasn’t always! My first experience of Paris was a stressful one. I was 19, fresh off the gap-year boat, and had no idea how to be a smart traveller. I also stayed at a grotty hostel and got stuck in the metro ticket gates due to my overly massive backpack. It was during that week that I made two lifelong changes to the way I travel: Forget backpacks, wheelie cases are the way forward. And hostels are just not my thing. I have Paris to thank for those lessons learned!\n\nI have met many people over the years who haven’t enjoyed Paris. Often times it is because they have romantic notions of the city, but haven’t taken into account the millions of other tourists, or the nature of a big city. I urge you to give Paris more than one chance!\n\nWhere to stay in Paris\n\nMy favourite area in Paris is the 5th arrondissment (the Latin Quarter), but accommodation in the 3rd & 4th (Marais), 6th (Saint Germain), and 9th (Pigalle), and 12th (Montmartre) is also convenient. The 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th arrondissements straddle the Seine either side of Ile de la Cité and Ile Saint-Louis (the little islands in the middle of the Seine). The Latin Quarter stretches from the Boulevard Saint Michel and the Jardin des Luxumbourg to the Jardin des Plantes and down to Place d’Italie – it includes the famous Left Bank, the Sorbonne, the Pantheon, the Arab Institute and many lovely streets full of cafes. It is a great base to walk around Paris and has easy transport links. Search engines use ‘Saint Germain-Luxembourg‘ and ‘Pantheon-Notre-Dame‘ or ‘Latin Quarter‘ as identifiers.\n\nThere are many 2 and 3 star hotels along Rue Monge and Rue des Ècoles – such as Villa Pantheon which is a lovely 4-star, or Hotel de France Latin Quarter – a clean and good value 2-star. My favourite spots are near Luxembourg Gardens (Hotel Relais Saint Jacques) or in the Rue Monge / Rue des Écoles area, such as Hôtel Oratio in Saint-Germain, as it is equi-distant between my favourite attractions in town and Montparnasse. For something a bit special, try Hotel Le M in Montparnasse or the Hotel Les Dames du Pantheon & Hotel Des Grand Hommes du Pantheon in the 5th.\n\nWhere to eat in Paris\n\nCave la Bourgogne\n\nMy number one favourite hangout in Paris + the biggest salads ever!\n\nSquare St Médard (bottom of Rue Mouffetard)\n\nMetro: Censier Daubenton / Les Gobelins\n\nBy far the best bistro in the fifth – lovely outdoor seating area with heat lamps, overlooking Square St Médard and the lively markets at the bottom of Rue Mouffetard. You can get the most amazingly huge salads ever – the Salade Complèt is only €12. Huge bowls with goats cheese, sautéed potatoes, meat and salad, and a fried egg on top. I’ve been going back for the last 15 years and the food is consistently good.\n\nPolidor\n\nFor a seriously good steak + elbow-to-elbow trestle-table French dining\n\n41 Rue Monsieur le Prince (off Boulevard St Germain)\n\nMetro: St Germain des Pres (although, walkable from Latin Quartier)\n\nOpen Mon-Sat 12-2.30 & 7-12:30am, Sunday 12-2.30 & 7-11pm. This is a proper traditional french eatery – trestle tables, everyone sitting side-by-side, eating amazing food. They have a decent set menu, but I recommend dining a lá carte. Get the steak tartare, or the the rump steak with pepper sauce (steak au poivre). I usually average 2 courses, wine & coffee for about £30pp.\n\nUnfortunately, this place became a little famous after it was featured in Woody Allen’s 2011 film ‘Midnight in Paris’ – so the level of tourist diners has increased. Although I do laugh when I imagine the looks on their faces at the traditional tiled squat toilet that the restaurant offers!\n\nLeftbank\n\nThis is tourist-town and pushy waiters will vie for your custom – but it can be cheap!\n\nMetro: Saint-Michel; Saint-Michel Notre Dame; Cluny – La Sorbonne\n\nOn La Rive Gauche (the Left Bank) is a warren of wee streets off the Seine – these have been taken over by restaurants and tourist tat shops. However, there are some deals to be had – if you’ve run out of money and only have €10-12 euro left, this is where you can come and still get a 3-course meal! A tip is to avoid the touters and go to the smaller busier-looking places. I quite enjoy taking a walk through the Leftbank purely for the atmosphere and buzz.\n\nFor a cheap Moroccan meal, try Au Bon Couscous on 7 Rue Xavier Privas; for an French set menu, try La Cochonnaille on Rue de la Harpe. Sweet treats can be found at Maison Georges Larnicol (for macarons), or Sud tunisien (for amazing Tunisian sweet treats); both on opposite corners where Rue de la Harpe meets Rue Saint-Séverin.\n\nBouillon Chartier\n\nWorkers lunches in lush surroundings, Montmartre & Montparnasse locations\n\nMetro: Grands Boulevards (Montmartre) / Montparnasse or Falguière (Montparnasse)\n\nBouillons are the original fast food restaurants of Paris. Large scale restaurants serving quick meals for the local market workers. The thing is, back when these restaurants were popular (during the Belle Epoque), the standards of decoration were much higher – so these historic buildings are stunningly beautiful. The food is super simple, no frills, but hearty and well-priced.\n\nLove French food? Why not take a cooking class in Paris!\n\nMy Favourite area in Paris\n\nRue Mouffetard\n\nThe best (and oldest) street in Paris!\n\nMetro: Rue Monge\n\nRue Mouffetard is one of the oldest streets in Paris. It can be traced back to Roman times, and managed to avoid the Haussman renovations. It is therefore joyfully narrow, wonky, and terribly quaint.\n\nI love this street. There are markets at the bottom, and fresh food shops in the lower quarter – bakeries, butchers, cheese shops, wine shops, fresh pasta etc. Then if you meander up the hill you’ll find gift shops, trinkets, clothes, restaurants, cafes, and a bowling alley. At the top – Place de la Contrescarpe – a wee square with cafes all around! If you hit this place in the morning, it’s a perfect spot to people-watch over a coffee. The Pantheon is nearby, so you can combine with some sightseeing.\n\nFor a good value French set menu costing between €15-22, hit La Grange (72 Rue Mouffetard) or Au Petit Bistrot (89 Rue Mouffetard). On Rue du Pot de Fer, I would recommend is Le Bar de Fer – a great wine bar with graffiti on the walls and live music. I can also recommend the disco bowling at 73 Rue Mouffetard – nothing like a bit of blue-light bowling whilst drunk on cheap house wine!\n\nHappy hour on Place de la contrescarpe\n\nPlace de la Contrescarpe\n\nMetro: Rue Monge\n\nI would also recommend Place de la Contrescarpe and the bars on Mouffetard for the happy hours, although you will find them all over the city. There is no such thing as ONE happy hour in France, it is always multiple hours – usually running from 17h00 to 19h00 or 20h00 (i.e. dinner time). Apéro time is taken VERY seriously in France, and the generous l’heure de l’apéro allow one to enjoy many apéritifs for very reasonable prices.\n\nNightlife\n\nLa Fée Verte\n\n108 Rue de la Roquette\n\nMetro: Voltaire\n\nGreat for late night food, cocktails, and absinthe, La Fée Verte is a lovely spot in the heart of the 11th arrondissement.\n\nAu Cafe de Paris\n\n158 rue Oberkampf\n\nMetro: Menilmontant\n\nThis beautiful belle époque bar is a bit of a surprise. It doesn’t look like much, but walk right to the end of the bar and there is a frescoed ballroom that hosts theatre, poetry and music, downstairs is a tiny cellar bar for bands.\n\nAu Lapin Agile\n\n22 Rue des Saules\n\nMetro: Lamarck – Caulaincourt\n\nThis is an old fashioned French cabaret, with folk singing and poetry. Don’t go here if you want frilly knickers and a can-can. It is a special evening, and the tickets are much sought after. Guests get squished into bench seats around the performers and served cherry liquor on arrival.\n\nMoulin Rouge / Lido / Crazy Horse\n\nThese are the 3 top cabaret shows in Paris. They cost around €100-150 for dinner and a show. Moulin Rouge is in Pigalle, and is the most famous – but isn’t always the best. I’d go to the Lido – it’s on the Champs-Elysées and is a good mix of old cabaret and new technology. The Crazy Horse is the most authentic, but is a tad avant-garde! They usually run 2 shows a night, but book in advance.\n\nOffbeat places to visit in Paris\n\nFor the best FREE view in Paris (aside from up at Sacre Coeur)\n\nGaleries La Fayette department store\n\n40 Boulevard Haussman\n\nMetro: Chausée d’Antin\n\nIf you go to the top floor of Galeries La Fayette and go out on to the balcony, there are sweeping views to the Opera house and beyond and pretty much 360 around the city. It’s the best free view you’re gonna get – and a bit of a hidden gem! The view from the Montparnasse Tower is also amazing, and isn’t nearly as much hassle as queuing for the Eiffel Tower.\n\nMontparnasse Cemetery\n\nMetro: Denfert-Rochereau\n\nMost people flock to Père-Lachaise (which is amazing), but I love a visit to the Montparnasse Cemetery instead. It is beautiful and some pretty famous folks are buried here. Baudelaire, Man Ray, Jean-Paul Sartre & Simone de Beauvoir, amongst others.\n\nTIP – If you do visit Père-Lachaise cemetery, the resting place of Oscar Wilde, Edith Piaf, Jim Morrison etc., get off the metro at Gambetta (not the Père-Lachaise stop), as this allows you to walk DOWN the hill rather than UP!\n\nThe Catacombs\n\nMetro: Denfert-Rochereau\n\nThe Catacombs are amazing, if not a little macabre. Thousands of bodies were moved from cemeteries during the expansion of Paris. They were then stacked neatly into these catacombs under the city. It’s only about €12, and well worth the 130 steps down and the 83 step climb back out again! Get there early or go on a weekday if you can (hours are 10h00 to 20h30, last admission is 19h30); as they can only let 200 people into the catacombs at one time.\n\nIle de la cité & Île Saint-Louis\n\nThere are some other great things to do on the river islands of Paris. Visit Sainte-Chapelle, the gothic chapel within the medieval Palais de la Cité. With some of the most stunning stained glass you’ll ever see. Or have a picnic at Square du Vert-Galant, the garden at the western tip of Ile de la cité. Or, on a hot day, try the famous ice-cream at Berthillon glacier, 29-31 Rue Saint-Louis en l’Île.\n\nBouquinistes\n\nYou must take a wander along the Seine on the Leftbank between Quai de la Tournelle and Quai Voltaire; to visit the Bouquinistes (book sellers). This unique way to sell books, art and souvenirs is actually a UNESCO World Heritage site. These wooden boxes sit on the walls of the Seine and fold out to display the books inside. Books in English and French are on offer.\n\nMusée Carnavalet\n\n16 Rue des Francs Bourgeois\n\nMetro: Saint-Paul or Chemin Vert\n\nCarnavalet is la Musée de l’histoire de Paris. It is one of the lesser-visited museums, but it has recently had a huge refurbishment, so is well worth a visit.\n\nPlace du Tertre & The Back of Montmartre\n\nMetro: Abesses\n\nTucked behind Montmartre, there is a square of artists who work and sell their wares. Over the years this has become a bit of a tourist hot spot, but there are some wonderful artists on the square. I have been buying little abstract Paris scenes from an artist called ‘Telemacchus’ for the last 20 years, and now have a little collection.\n\nHead on down behind Place du Tertre to see some of the old bars of Montmartre – Le Consulat, La Bonne Franquette, and La Maison Rose. You’ve probably seen some of these places on Instagram. Head down the hill to the right of La Maison Rose to see the ancient vineyard of Montmartre and Au Lapin Agile.\n\nLe mur des je t’aime (The I Love You Wall)\n\nPlace des Abesses – Square Jehan Rictus\n\nMetro: Abesses\n\nTrust Paris to have a whole wall dedicated to saying ‘I love you’ in every language. Set in a small garden just up from the Abesses Metro stop, you can sit and marvel at the words. Why not grab some churros from the fun-fair vendor nearby and share in one of the reasons why Paris truly is The City of Love with your travel companion / lover / friend!\n\nEnjoy the green spaces in Paris\n\nPromenade Plantée\n\n1 Coulée verte René-Dumont, 75012\n\nMetro: Bastille\n\nThe Promenade Plantée (or the Coulée verte René-Dumont) is a 4.7km long walkway and garden, using an old abandoned railway line. It gives the most wonderful views of Paris – at a height you usually don’t have. You’ve probably heard of the High Line in NYC? Well, that was based on the Promenade Plantée.\n\nJardin du Luxembourg\n\nRER: Luxembourg, Metro: Saint-Sulpice\n\nThe Jardin du Luxembourg is one of my favourite places to have a picnic and enjoy a sunny day in Paris. These manicured gardens are peaceful and there are chairs provided for free around the park. The Musée du Luxembourg is worth a visit too – a great use of this ex-château.\n\nCanal Saint Martin\n\nIf your first visit to Paris is in summer, take a wander to Canal Saint Martin (in the 10th arrondissement, beyond Le Marais). It’s a little hipster, but a great relaxed vibe.\n\nParc des Buttes Chaumont\n\n19th Arrondissement\n\nMetro: Buttes Chaumont\n\nThere are so many beautiful green spaces in Paris, and the Parc des Buttes Chaumont is one of my absolute favourites. This park has lots of paths, a bridge, and a huge rock formation in the middle. Atop this hill is a folly with the most incredible view.\n\nDid you know you can easily take your dog to Paris? It’s a very dog-friendly city!\n\nTourist Tips\n\nIf you want to avoid the queues, start your day early! Queues at the Eiffel Tower, and the Louvre are usually decent by 10am; and by mid-morning they are crazy! Don’t buy a bus tour ticket, they are a waste of time, and you can do everything on the metro anyway. Buy a carnet of metro tickets (19€10 for ten tickets in Jan 2023), and you can use them for 1.5hrs on buses, metro, and the funicular up to Montmartre).\n\nTry to get up to Sacre Coeur on Montmartre, even if only for the view – but be careful to avoid the ‘stringmen’ that loiter in the park and on the steps on your way up. They will try to grab your hands and put bracelets on you (for you to then pay for). Just avoid eye contact, and keep walking. Be careful to know your surroundings at night – like in every big city, there are less safe areas, so ask at your hotel if you are concerned.\n\nThe best way to blend in with the Parisians is to look like them! Check out this guide of what to wear in Paris.\n\nA beginner’s guide to Paris\n\nThere are a lot of things to do and places to visit in Paris. And I hope this beginner’s guide to Paris has offered you a few less touristy alternatives to consider. But if I have one tip for you it is this: Sit in cafes, watch the world, have a glass of wine (or two) and read a book – it is a whole different experience in la belle Paris. Enjoy my favourite city in the world!\n\nParis is my jam. Seriously, it is my soul city and I am passionate about ensuring you have a great time there!
