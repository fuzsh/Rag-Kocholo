        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Brooke\n\nBrooke is an English name with an Old English origin, derived from the word “Broc,” which means ‘small stream.’ It was traditionally a surname, spelled as Broc back in the 12th century in Essex, and was used to refer to people that stayed near flowing water bodies or streams.\n\nThe name first appeared in the 16th century as a given name for girls, but it was not until the 19th century that it became more popular as a first name for both boys and girls. This was partly due to the popularity of the Victorian poet Rupert Brooke, named after a small river in Rugby, England.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the name Brooke continued to gain popularity, particularly in the United States, where it became a popular name for girls. It was also used as a surname by some families, such as the Brooke family in England, who were prominent in British politics and society.\n\nDifferent variants of the name are popular across different cultures and countries, such as Brigitte and Brice, which are French variants; Brücke and Brigitte are more popular among the German-speaking population; Irish people prefer Brogan and Brónach; Italian variants are Briciole and Bruna, Welsh people prefer it as Brwyn and Bronwyn, while Swedish people use variants like Brook and Brooklin.\n\nSeveral well-known occurrences of the name Brooke were seen in famous television shows, movies, and books. Brooke is a name that has been used for several fictional characters across different forms of media. In the popular Japanese manga and anime series “One Piece,” Brook is a talking skeleton and a member of the Straw Hat Pirates. The Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” features Brook Soso, a new inmate who becomes friends with the main character. “One Tree Hill” features Brooke Davis, a high school student who becomes a successful fashion designer. In the book “Love on the Lifts” by Rachel Hawthorne, Brook Sterling is a ski instructor who falls in love with the main character, and in the MTV series “Scream,” Brooke Maddox is a popular high school student who becomes the target of a serial killer.\n\nHow To Pronounce Brooke?\n\n‘Brooke’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Brooke\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Brooke famous with their contributions in various fields.
