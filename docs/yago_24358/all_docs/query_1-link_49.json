        "text": "I'm on this \"cataloging\" kick (it is my OCD).\n\nI want to show how the soap universe is connected, by making a list of crossovers.\n\nI started a list (it is now ugly, unformatted, unordered). I'll pretty it up when it is more \"canonical\". I am only focusing, more or less, on current/recent soaps, but those with knowledge of long-dead soaps are welcome to add those too.\n\nWhat I am asking for is your help: What am I missing? Thanks to Y&RWorldTurner, All My Shadows, Jack Peyton, Jinx Avery, Sindacco, Zendall Fan (SON), Seth J. Bookey, K McC(Usenet) and an anonymous commenter at blogger.com for additions and changes. I am also indebted to the AWHP at this link.\n\nFor brevity, I am treating GH and GH:Night Shift as pretty much the same show. See JP's notes below the table for additional detail, though\n\nThe P&G shows frequently reference one another's towns (Bay City, Oakdale, Springfield), and the ABC shows do too (Port Charles, Llanview, and Pine Valley). The Bell shows also mention Los Angeles and Genoa City on one another's shows. Specific crossovers follow.\n\nThe permanent record is at my blog. There you will also find alternative versions of the table that are sorted by show, and by year of first crossover.\n\nHere is the list I have so far:\n\nFrom To Character Year Notes AMC OLTL Skye Chandler 1998 (became a regular) OLTL GH Skye Chandler 2002 (became a Quartermaine sort of; married Alcazar) OLTL GH Marco Dane 1992 (became a regular) OLTL AMC/GH/PC Gretel Rae Cummings 1999 2000 2003 long story....
