        "text": "Christian Charles Philip Bale was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK on January 30, 1974, to English parents Jennifer \"Jenny\" (James) and David Bale. His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale's childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.\n\nHis first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia (1986) caught Steven Spielberg's eye, leading to Bale's well-documented role in Das Reich der Sonne (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.\n\nAdjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V. (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Die Schatzinsel (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Die Zeitungsjungen (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Betty und ihre Schwestern (1994), Portrait of a Lady (1996), Der Geheimagent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and Ein Sommernachtstraum (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.\n\nBale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron's adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\".\n\nBale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft - Noch Fragen? (2000), Corellis Mandoline (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Die Herrschaft des Feuers (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.\n\nTwo more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and Der Maschinist (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale's physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.\n\nBale's abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan's definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.\n\nBale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman's phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times - Leben am Limit (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006's Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog's feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Flucht aus Laos (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), the remake of Todeszug nach Yuma (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, I'm Not There (2007).\n\nAnticipation for The Dark Knight (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale's graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.\n\nBale's next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator: Die Erlösung (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann's Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.\n\nFor all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.\n\nBale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic The Flowers of War (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.\n\nBale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Auge um Auge - Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.\n\nBale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.\n\nIn his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their two children.\n\nLiam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.\n\nThrough the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including Die Bounty (1984), Des Lebens bittere Süße (1984), Die Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect - Unter Verdacht (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in Der Preis der Gefühle (1988) and High Spirits - Die Geister sind willig! (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Unter Verdacht (1991) and Ethan Frome (1992), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Ehemänner und Ehefrauen (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindlers Liste (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.\n\nAlso in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - Die dunkle Bedrohung (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey - Die Wahrheit über Sex (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in Die Chroniken von Narnia - Der König von Narnia (2005).\n\nNeeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of 96 Hours (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Kampf der Titanen (2010) and Das A-Team - Der Film (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown Identity (2011), The Grey - Unter Wölfen (2011), Battleship (2012) and 96 Hours - Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel Zorn der Titanen (2012).\n\nNeeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).\n\nBest known for her long-time run on the ABC comedy, \"George Lopez\", Constance Marie stars next in the upcoming Latinx romantic comedy series, \"With Love\". Created and written by Gloria Calderon Kellett (\"One Day at a Time\"), the five hourlong episodes, each of which are set during a different holiday, follows the multi-generational Diaz family over the course of 12 months as they experience the highs and lows of life during some of the most heightened days of the year. Constance plays Beatriz Diaz, wife to Jorge Sr (Benito Martinez) and mother of two who is going through a midlife/identity crisis with her kids getting older and her marriage to Jorge Sr on auto pilot. All five episodes of \"With Love\" premiered on Amazon Prime Video on December 17, 2021.\n\nMost recently, Constance appeared in the Amazon rotoscope dramedy, \"Undone\", opposite Rosa Salazar, and she recurred in the Netflix comedy, \"Alexa & Katie\". In addition, she starred in the NBC miniseries \"Law & Order True Crime: Menendez Murders\". She has also guest-starred and recurred on a variety of shows including the CBS comedy \"Angel from Hell\" and TNT's \"Animal Kingdom\", as well as voicing a character on Disney's animated series \"Elena of Avalor\", the first to feature a Latina princess.\n\nConstance starred for five award-winning seasons on the hit Freeform series, \"Switched at Birth\", for which she won an Imagen Award, an ALMA Award and a Gracie Allen Award for Best Supporting Television Actress for her role as Regina Vasquez.\n\nFor her beloved portrayal of wife Angie Lopez on \"George Lopez\", the Imagen Awards honored her with a Best Actress in a TV Series Award, and she received multiple nominations from the Alma Awards for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nIn the debut year of \"George Lopez\", Constance was also starring in the Golden Globe-nominated PBS series \"American Family\", alongside Edward James Olmos, Sonia Braga, Esai Morales and Raquel Welch.\n\nHer career began when she was a teenager in the Los Angeles underground break-dancing scene. She was selected out of a group of 500 hopefuls to dance on tour with David Bowie. Upon returning to Los Angeles, she was cast as a dancer in the movie \"Salsa\". The film's choreographer, Kenny Ortega, introduced her to producer Steve Tisch, who offered Constance her very first acting job, a starring role as Penny on the CBS series \"Dirty Dancing\".\n\nIt wasn't long before she was working in feature films, such as \"My Family\", directed by Gregory Nava. She won praise from fans for her portrayal of Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla's mother, Marcella in the blockbuster film \"Selena\". Constance was only a year older than her onscreen daughter (Jennifer Lopez), so she had to undergo extensive make-up to portray Selena's mother.\n\nConstance also starred in the celebrated film \"Tortilla Soup\" as the daughter of Raquel Welch. The film received an Alma Award nomination for Outstanding Motion Picture.\n\nTelevision producer Gary David Goldberg soon offered Constance a role as Michael J. Fox's antagonist love interest on the hit series \"Spin City\". She played Gabriella Diaz on \"Union Square\", for which she received an Alma Award nomination for Outstanding Female in a Comedy Series. She also portrayed Detective Toni Brigatti for two seasons on \"Early Edition\", opposite Kyle Chandler.\n\nIn her personal life, Constance is mother to a daughter, Luna-Marie. Candid about the difficulties she faced trying to get pregnant and eventually turning to IVF, she is determined to reach out to women in similar situations to let them know that they are not alone. In addition to being extremely knowledgeable about pregnancy and wellness, she practices a green lifestyle including composting and recycling, and she is a vegetarian, leaning heavily toward vegan these days. She is also an organic follower who had cloth diapers for her baby and zero Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in her nursery, and she has organic mattresses in their home.\n\nShe is an advocate for PETA, Planned Parenthood and Equal Pay for Women. She is the spokesperson for the East Los Angeles Women's Center that helps women dealing with rape, domestic violence and human trafficking.\n\nConstance has an active lifestyle which includes regular work outs such as walking, yoga, hitting the gym with a personal trainer and nature hikes. Although she isn't currently dancing in an official capacity, she throws a hell of a spontaneous \"dancing in the dining room\" party. You can also catch her moves on TikTok.\n\nWith an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.\n\nFreeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including \"Easy Reader\", \"Mel Mounds\" and \"Count Dracula\" on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade - Der Kontrabulle (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica - Revolte hinter Gittern (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Der Augenzeuge (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Glitzernder Asphalt (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.\n\nHis star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in Fegefeuer der Eitelkeiten (1990), Robin Hood - König der Diebe (1991), and Im Glanz der Sonne (1992). Freeman's next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood's de-mythologized western Erbarmungslos (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! - Kampf um Freiheit (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.\n\nMore strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in Die Verurteilten (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Sieben (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Außer Kontrolle (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in ...Denn zum küssen sind sie da (1997).\n\nFurther praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute's black comedy Nurse Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Im Netz der Spinne (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama Der Anschlag (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired Dreamcatcher (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Bruce Allmächtig (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy Hawaii Crime Story (2004).\n\n2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman's on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy's judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg's Krieg der Welten (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.\n\nRoles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Lucky Number Slevin (2006), a second go-round as God in Evan Allmächtig (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck's directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone - Kein Kinderspiel (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit Das Beste kommt zum Schluss (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Wanted (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008).\n\nIn 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director's true-life drama Invictus - Unbezwungen (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.\n\nRecently, Freeman appeared in R.E.D. - Älter. Härter. Besser. (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner's The Magic of Belle Isle - Ein verzauberter Sommer (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Die Unfassbaren - Now You See Me (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.\n\nBest known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed Academy Award winner writer/director/producer Sir Christopher Nolan CBE was born in London, England. Over the course of more than 25 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made and became one of the most celebrated filmmakers of modern cinema.\n\nAt 7 years old, Nolan began making short films with his father's Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.\n\nNolan's second film was Memento (2000), which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan. Starring Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Insomnia - Schlaflos (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.\n\nThe turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.\n\nIn 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008). Co-written with by his brother Jonathan, the film went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of America (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations. The film is widely considered one of the best comic book adaptations of all times, with Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker receiving an extremely high acclaim. Ledger posthumously became the first Academy Award winning performance in a Nolan film.\n\nIn 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the Sci-Fi thriller Inception (2010), starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay that he worked on for almost a decade. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year, and of all times. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with a W.G.A. Award accolade, as well as D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards nominations for his work on the film.\n\nAs one of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The Dark Knight Rises (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to his success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted Nolan to produce their revamped Superman movie Man of Steel (2013), which opened in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Nolan directed, wrote, and produced the Science-Fiction epic Interstellar (2014), starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film on November 5, 2014, to positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670 million dollars worldwide.\n\nIn July 2017, Nolan released his acclaimed War epic Dunkirk (2017), that earned him his first Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards, as well as winning an additional 3 Oscars. In 2020 he released his mind-bending Sci-Fi espionage thriller Tenet (2020) starring John David Washington in the lead role. Released during the COVID-19 pandemic, the movie grossed relatively less than Nolan's previous blockbusters, though it did do good numbers compared to other movies in that period of time. Hailed as Nolan's most complex film yet, the film was one of Nolan's less-acclaimed films at the time, yet slowly built a fan-base following in later years.\n\nIn July 2023, Nolan released his highly acclaimed biographic drama Oppenheimer (2023) starring Nolan's frequent collaborator Cillian Murphy- in the lead role for the first time in a Nolan film. The movie was a cultural phenomenon that on top of grossing almost 1 billion dollars at the Worldwide Box office, also swept the 2023/2024 award-season and gave Nolan his first Oscars, BAFTAs, Golden Globes, D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards, as well as a handful of regional critics-circles awards and a W.G.A. nomination. Cillian's performance as quantum physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was highly acclaimed as well, and became the first lead performance in a Nolan film to win the Academy Award.\n\nDuring 2023, Nolan also received a fellowship from the British Film Institute (BFI). In March 2024, it was announced that Nolan is to be knighted by King Charles III and from now on will go by the title 'Sir Christopher Nolan'.\n\nNolan resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Academy Award winner producer Dame Emma Thomas, and their children. Sir Nolan and Dame Thomas also have their own production company, Syncopy.\n\nGerman-born composer Hans Zimmer is recognized as one of Hollywood's most innovative musical talents. He featured in the music video for The Buggles' single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which became a worldwide hit and helped usher in a new era of global entertainment as the first music video to be aired on MTV (August 1, 1981).\n\nHans Florian Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, then in West Germany, the son of Brigitte (Weil) and Hans Joachim Zimmer. He entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with famed composer and mentor Stanley Myers, which included the film Mein wunderbarer Waschsalon (1985). He soon began work on several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed A World Apart, and during these years Zimmer pioneered the use of combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.\n\nA turning point in Zimmer's career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director Barry Levinson. The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year and earned Zimmer his first Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Score. The next year, Zimmer composed the score for another Best Picture Oscar recipient, Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989), starring Jessica Tandy, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nHaving already scored two Best Picture winners, in the early 1990s, Zimmer cemented his position as a preeminent talent with the award-winning score for Der König der Löwen (1994). The soundtrack has sold over 15 million copies to date and earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, an American Music Award, a Tony, and two Grammy Awards. In total, Zimmer's work has been nominated for 7 Golden Globes, 7 Grammys and seven Oscars for Rain Man (1988), Gladiator (2000), Der König der Löwen (1994), Besser geht's nicht (1997), The Rendezvous mit einem Engel (1996), Der schmale Grat (1998), Der Prinz von Ägypten (1998), and Last Samurai (2003).\n\nWith his career in full swing, Zimmer was anxious to replicate the mentoring experience he had benefited from under Stanley Myers' guidance. With state-of-the-art technology and a supportive creative environment, Zimmer was able to offer film-scoring opportunities to young composers at his Santa Monica-based musical \"think tank.\" This approach helped launch the careers of such notable composers as Mark Mancina, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick Glennie-Smith, and Klaus Badelt.\n\nIn 2000, Zimmer scored the music for Gladiator (2000), for which he received an Oscar nomination, in addition to Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics Awards for his epic score. It sold more than three million copies worldwide and spawned a second album Gladiator: More Music From The Motion Picture, released on the Universal Classics/Decca label. Zimmer's other scores that year included Mission: Impossible II (2000), Der Weg nach El Dorado (2000), and Mit oder ohne - Was Männer haben sollten (2000), directed by Barry Levinson.\n\nSome of his other impressive scores include Pearl Harbor (2001), Ring (2002), four films directed by Ridley Scott; Tricks (2003), Hannibal (2001), Black Hawk Down (2001), and Thelma & Louise (1991), Penny Marshall's Unterwegs mit Jungs (2001), and Eine Klasse für sich (1992), Tony Scott's True Romance (1993), Tränen der Sonne (2003), Ron Howard's Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), Tage des Donners (1990), Fräulein Smillas Gespür für Schnee (1997), and the animated Spirit - Der wilde Mustang (2002) for which he also co-wrote four of the songs with Bryan Adams, including the Golden Globe nominated Here I Am.\n\nAt the 27th annual Flanders International Film Festival, Zimmer performed live for the first time in concert with a 100-piece orchestra and a 100-voice choir. Choosing selections from his impressive body of work, Zimmer performed newly orchestrated concert versions of Gladiator, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rain Man (1988), Der König der Löwen (1994), and Der schmale Grat (1998). The concert was recorded by Decca and released as a concert album entitled \"The Wings Of A Film: The Music Of Hans Zimmer.\"\n\nIn 2003, Zimmer completed his 100th film score for the film The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, for which he received both a Golden Globe and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination. Zimmer then scored Nancy Meyers' comedy Was das Herz begehrt (2003), the animated Dreamworks film, Große Haie - Kleine Fische (2004) (featuring voices of Will Smith, Renée Zellweger, Robert De Niro, Jack Black, and Martin Scorsese), and Jim Brooks' Spanglish (2004) starring Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni (for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination). His 2005 projects include Paramount's The Weather Man (2005) starring Nicolas Cage, Dreamworks' Madagascar (2005), and the Warner Bros. summer release, Batman Begins (2005).\n\nZimmer's additional honors and awards include the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review, and the Frederick Loewe Award in 2003 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. He has also received ASCAP's Henry Mancini Award for Lifetime Achievement. Hans and his wife live in Los Angeles and he is the father of four children.\n\nMichael Caine was born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen (née Burchell), a cook, and Maurice Micklewhite Sr., a fish-market porter. He had a younger brother, Stanley Caine, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised Die Caine war ihr Schicksal (1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\".\n\nZulu - Die Schlacht von Rorke's Drift (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in Ipcress - streng geheim (1965) and the title role in Der Verführer läßt schön grüßen (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Das Mädchen aus der Cherry-Bar (1966), Finale in Berlin (1966), Ein dreckiger Haufen (1969), Die Luftschlacht um England (1969), Himmelfahrtskommando Okinawa (1970), Das vergessene Tal (1971) and especially Jack rechnet ab (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.\n\nHowever, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in Der Mann, der König sein wollte (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in Der Adler ist gelandet (1976). Rita will es endlich wissen (1983), Schuld daran ist Rio (1984) and Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), Gottes Werk und Teufels Beitrag (1999) (his second Oscar) and Letzte Runde (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers in Goldständer (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan's films including Prestige - Die Meister der Magie (2006), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men (2006) and Pixar's sequel Cars 2 (2011).\n\nAs of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.\n\nCaine has been married twice. First to actress Patricia Haines from 1954 to 1958. They had a daughter, Dominique, in 1957. A bachelor for some dozen-plus years after the divorce, he was romantically linked to Edina Ronay (for three years), Elizabeth Ercy, Nancy Sinatra, Natalie Wood, Candice Bergen, Bianca Jagger, Françoise Pascal and Jill St. John. In 1971 he met his second wife, fashion model Shakira Caine (née Baksh), and they married in 1973, six months before their daughter Natasha was born. The couple has three grandchildren, and in 2023, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nGary Oldman is a talented English movie star and character actor, renowned for his expressive acting style. One of the most celebrated thespians of his generation, with a diverse career encompassing theatre, film and television, he is known for his roles as Sid Vicious in Sid & Nancy (1986), Drexl in True Romance (1993), George Smiley in Dame, König, As, Spion (2011), and Winston Churchill in Die dunkelste Stunde (2017), among many others. For much of his career, he was best-known for playing over-the-top antagonists, such as terrorist Egor Korshunov in the 1997 blockbuster Air Force One (1997), though he has reached a new audience with heroic roles in the Harry Potter and Dark Knight franchises. He is also a filmmaker, musician, and author.\n\nGary Leonard Oldman was born on March 21, 1958 in New Cross, London, England, to Kathleen (Cheriton), a homemaker, and Leonard Bertram Oldman, a welder. He won a scholarship to Britain's Rose Bruford Drama College, in Sidcup, Kent, where he received a B.A. in theatre arts in 1979. He subsequently studied with the Greenwich Young People's Theatre and went on to appear in a number of plays throughout the early '80s, including \"The Pope's Wedding,\" for which he received Time Out's Fringe Award for Best Newcomer of 1985-1986 and the British Theatre Association's Drama Magazine Award as Best Actor for 1985. Before fame, he was employed as a worker in assembly lines and as a porter in an operating theater. He also had jobs selling shoes and beheading pigs while supporting his early acting career.\n\nHis film debut was Remembrance (1982), though his most-memorable early role came when he played Sex Pistol Sid Vicious in the biopic Sid & Nancy (1986) picking up the Evening Standard Film Award as Best Newcomer. He then received a Best Actor nomination from BAFTA for his portrayal of '60s playwright Joe Orton in Das stürmische Leben des Joe Orton (1987).\n\nIn the 1990s, Oldman brought to life a series of iconic real-world and fictional villains including Lee Harvey Oswald in JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991), the title character in Bram Stokers Dracula (1992), Drexl Spivey in True Romance (1993), Stansfield in Léon: Der Profi (1994), Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg in Das fünfte Element (1997) and Ivan Korshunov in Air Force One (1997). That decade also saw Oldman portraying Ludwig van Beethoven in biopic Ludwig van B. - Meine unsterbliche Geliebte (1994).\n\nOldman played the coveted role of Sirius Black in Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban (2004), giving him a key part in one of the highest-grossing franchises ever. He reprised that role in Harry Potter und der Feuerkelch (2005) and Harry Potter und der Orden des Phönix (2007). Oldman also took on the iconic role of Detective James Gordon in writer-director Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), a role he played again in The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Prominent film critic Mark Kermode, in reviewing The Dark Knight, wrote, \"the best performance in the film, by a mile, is Gary Oldman's ... it would be lovely to see him get a[n Academy Award] nomination because actually, he's the guy who gets kind of overlooked in all of this.\"\n\nOldman co-starred with Jim Carrey in the 2009 version of A Christmas Carol in which Oldman played three roles. He had a starring role in David Goyer's supernatural thriller The Unborn, released in 2009. In 2010, Oldman co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Book of Eli. He also played a lead role in Catherine Hardwicke's Red Riding Hood. Oldman voiced the role of villain Lord Shen and was nominated for an Annie Award for his performance in Kung Fu Panda 2.\n\nIn 2011, Oldman portrayed master spy George Smiley in the adaptation of John le Carré's Dame, König, As, Spion (2011), and the role scored Oldman his first Academy Award nomination. In 2014, he played one of the lead humans in the science fiction action film Planet der Affen: Revolution (2014) alongside Jason Clarke and Keri Russell. Also in 2014, Oldman starred alongside Joel Kinnaman, Abbie Cornish, Michael Keaton, and Samuel L. Jackson in the remake of RoboCop (2014), as Norton, the scientist who creates RoboCop.\n\nAside from acting, Oldman tried his hand at writing and directing for Nil by Mouth (1997). The movie opened the Cannes Film Festival in 1997, and won Kathy Burke a Best Actress prize at the festival.\n\nOldman has three children, Alfie, with first wife, actress Lesley Manville, and Gulliver and Charlie with his third wife, Donya Fiorentino. In 2017, he married writer and art curator Gisele Schmidt.\n\nIn 2018 he won an Oscar for best actor for his work on Die dunkelste Stunde (2017).\n\nBorn two months premature at four pounds, Kate Noelle Holmes made her first appearance on December 18, 1978, in Toledo, Ohio. She is the daughter of Kathleen Ann (Craft), a philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes, Sr., a lawyer. She is of German, Irish, and English ancestry. Her parents have said that her strong-willed personality is probably due to her early birth. Being the youngest in the Holmes clan, completing the family of three other sisters and one brother, Katie was always the baby.\n\nAs a teenager, she began attending modeling school. When she was sixteen, her teacher invited her to go to a modeling competition with other girls from her class. She competed in the International Modeling and Talent Association by singing, dancing, and reciting a monologue from Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962). By the end of that time in New York, Katie won many awards. But she said she didn't want to model because it wasn't challenging enough. So when she was seventeen, Katie went to Los Angeles to audition for movies. Luckily, on her second audition, she was cast in the movie, Der Eissturm (1997), directed by Ang Lee. Katie's character was Libbets Casey, a rich New Yorker, who is pursued by two of the main characters. It was a small part, but it marked the beginning of her professional acting career.\n\nAfter the excitement of her first movie, Katie began sending in audition tapes for pilot shows. During that time, she was also starring in her all-girls Catholic high school musical, Damn Yankees, as Lola. After Kevin Williamson received her audition tape for his new show, Dawsons Creek (1998), the producers wanted her to come to Hollywood right away and read live for them. But because they wanted her to come on the opening night for Damn Yankees, Katie had to tell them she couldn't make it. Fortunately, the show's producers wanted her so much for that role, they rescheduled her callback and the result was she got the part as Joey Potter. During her first year with Dawsons Creek (1998), Katie was able to do two movies, Dich kriegen wir auch noch! (1998) and Go! Das Leben beginnt erst um 3.00 Uhr morgens (1999), and, for the former, she won Best Breakthrough Female Performance at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards.\n\nThe following year, she starred next to Michael Douglas in Die Wonder Boys (2000), playing Hannah Green, a published author and a boarder at her teacher's (Douglas) house, who has a crush on him, and tries to seduce him. Her first leading role came in 2002, with Abandon - Ein mörderisches Spiel (2002). She played a college student named Katie Burke, who is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend who vanished two years prior. With Dawsons Creek (1998) coming to a close after six years in May of 2003, it was a bittersweet moment for all the cast. Accustomed to being in North Carolina filming ten months out of a year, the cast members now had the opportunity to make more movies.\n\nKatie demonstrated this in October, when she had two new movies, Pieces of April - Ein Tag mit April Burns (2003) and The Singing Detective (2003), coming out in that month alone. Pieces of April - Ein Tag mit April Burns (2003) is a charming Thanksgiving movie about April (Holmes), the black sheep of her family, who wants to give her family the perfect dinner before her mother passes on. The Singing Detective (2003) is a dark musical where the main character (Robert Downey Jr.) was a writer in a hospital for skin conditions who writes a dark world of seduction and murder in his mind. Katie Holmes played the kind Nurse Mills who tends to his every need. She also gets to lip sync and dance in this movie. In 2004, she starred in the romantic movie First Daughter - Date mit Hindernissen (2004), in which she played the President's (Michael Keaton) daughter, Samantha, who wants to go to college without any Secret Service tagging along. In 2005, Holmes co-starred in Batman Begins (2005), where she played Rachel Dawes, a childhood sweetheart and love interest to Batman/Bruce Wayne.\n\nKatie has a daughter with her ex-husband, Tom Cruise.\n\nIn 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.\n\nTom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.\n\nWith handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top-grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); Die Farbe des Geldes (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview mit einem Vampir (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire: Spiel des Lebens (1996), for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. Tom Cruise's biggest franchise, Mission Impossible, has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom Cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing, with his biggest producer credits being the Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nIn 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever.\n\nEd Limato was the last of the great Hollywood talent agents - a breed that dwindled with the loss of Stan Kamen and Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar. Over the years, Ed Limato's client list read like a who's who of Hollywood royalty and Oscar winners, including Antonio Banderas, Michael Biehn, Nicholas Cage, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Claire Danes, Geena Davis, Robert Downey, Jr., James Franco, Matthew Fox, Ava Gardner, Mel Gibson, Richard Gere, Melanie Griffith, Goldie Hawn, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thomas Jane, Frank Langella, Jennifer Lopez, Derek Luke, director Adrian Lyne, Madonna, Steve Martin, Matthew McConaughey, Bette Midler, Liam Neeson, Sam Neill, Nate Parker, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dennis Quaid, Doris Roberts, Diana Ross, Winona Ryder, David Selby, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Meryl Streep, Paul Walker, Denzel Washington, and Marlon Brando. To Limato, his clients were less business and more family. He was known to cry when one would leave him for another agent. Instead of family photographs in his living room, he kept exquisitely framed headshots of every actor he ever represented.\n\nEd Limato was in a class by himself - an iconoclast, as Vanity Fair once called him - a talent agent who glided through Hollywood with poise and panache. He hearkened back to the Golden Age, a time when men were more refined and elegant, as if he were preparing for an evening at the Mocambo. Yet despite his reverence for Hollywood of yore, his client list kept him active and relevant into the 21st century. He was as colorful as he was powerful. Always handsomely coiffed and impeccably dressed, Limato would promenade into the office wearing Italian suits of mustard yellow or salmon pink, rallying to his assistants, \"Let's talk to the stars.\"\n\nEdward Frank Limato was born on July 10, 1936 in Mount Vernon, New York into a middle class Italian-American family. As a young man, he left home and traveled the country, earning money as a disc jockey. Continued restlessness took him to Europe in 1966, where he eventually landed a job on the set of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" as an assistant to director Franco Zeffirelli. From a very young age, Limato loved movies and movie stars. He seemed obsessed with the business of Hollywood and studied the trades. In a 1990 Vanity Fair article, actor Michael York, who met Limato on the set, said, \"I was the first person to tell him he should be an agent. I told him he must obey his destiny and go to the mailroom.\" With the help of Zeffirelli's agent, Limato returned to New York and took a job in the mailroom at Ashley-Famous Agency, which eventually became International Famous Agency - where he was promoted to junior agent. Later, Ashley-Famous merged with Creative Management Associates to become International Creative Management (ICM). He transferred to ICM's west coast office but was lured away to the William Morris Agency in 1978 by Stan Kamen. He remained there until 1986 when, after a series of secret meetings with ICM CEO Jeff Berg and agent Sam Cohn, he returned to the agency that gave him his start. He stayed there for two decades until trouble brewed.\n\nIn 2006, ICM merged with Broder Webb Chervin Silbermann, primarily a TV literary agency. But within a year, the seams at the new agency came apart. Limato claimed both his authority and stature were being undermined by the new regime, which, he alleged, planned on forcing him into a consultant position and early retirement. Limato wanted out of his contract. ICM refused. The dispute was taken to arbitration, where Limato challenged a 3-year non-compete clause, which forbade him to work for another agency. The battle became a publicity nightmare for ICM, as it played out in the national news.\n\nDuring arbitration, Limato's lawyers argued that his contract dated back to the mid-90s and was bound by an obscure California law known as the \"seven year rule,\" stating that anyone who renders extraordinary or unique services cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years. On August 13, 2007, the arbitrator found in favor of the agent and against ICM. With Limato a free agent, Variety wrote, \"\"Ed Limato's arbitration victory over ICM...puts into play not only one of Hollywood's most senior and revered agents but also the most important client list in a generation.\" Limato was one of the few talent agents who could boast a fistful of clients with salaries of more than 20 million dollars a film plus first dollar gross. Almost immediately, he and his talent list made a return trip to the venerable William Morris Agency, which merged with Endeavor in June 2009 to form WME. Some industry insiders claim that ICM never recovered its movie business after Limato's exit.\n\nWhen Limato wasn't negotiating deals for the rich and famous, he served on the boards of Abercrombie & Fitch, the LA Conservancy, the American Cinematheque, and the MPTF.\n\nLimato's fame as an agent might have only been eclipsed by his annual Oscar party, a relaxed but star-studded event that was held at his home the Friday before the Academy Awards. Limato reigned supreme over the party in flamboyant regalia and bare feet. The guest list looked like the hall of fame from politics, movies, TV, music, and literature.\n\nWhen Ed Limato passed away on July 3, 2010 - a few days shy of his 74 birthday - some of his most famous clients remembered him. Richard Gere said, \"Ed was my dear friend and agent for 40 years. He was the best of the best. There will never be anyone like him. The mold has been broken. He was probably the most respected agent of our time who loved his clients dearly and would do anything for them.\" Mel Gibson said, \"It's said of agents 'they have no hearts'. Ed was all heart! He was there for me 30 years. I will miss him.\" Steve Martin said \"Ed Limato not only represented important actors in Hollywood, but also represented class and kindness.\"\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer was 23 when her agent resigned and turned her over to Ed Limato, a name she recognized but a man she'd never met. Limato always envisioned her as the Marilyn Monroe-type, which wasn't quite in line with her thinking. He once called her before an award ceremony and told her that Giorgio Armani wanted to dress her. She responded, \"Who's that and why on earth would I need someone to dress me?\" \"I think it's a good idea,\" Limato told her. She followed his instructions, but instead of settling on one of Armani's classic beaded gowns, she chose a black dress suit instead. \"Poor Ed,\" she said, \"I fell a tad short of the glamour-puss he had envisioned.\" After playing some character roles, Limato tried to chaperone her back into the glamour parts. He once warned her in his inimitable style, \"If you think your public wants to see you in another wig and accent, you're mistaken.\" She remembers just hanging out in his office while he worked - simply because she felt safe there.\n\nA memorial service was held for Ed Limato in the theater on the lot of Paramount Studios on January 11, 2011. He was eulogized by Mel Gibson, Richard Gere, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Denzel Washington. Washington told the audience that he grew up in the same town as Limato and, coincidentally, lived in a house built by Limato's father.\n\nSir Elton John eulogized his late friend with the song \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.\"\n\nBrooke Burke holds many titles, including: mother, television host, fitness guru, pod-caster, author, social media mogul (with almost 4 million followers), and cancer survivor.
