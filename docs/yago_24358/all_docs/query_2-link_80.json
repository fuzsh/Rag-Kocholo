        "text": "Country music singer-songwriter Brooke McClymont, and her husband Adam Eckersley, welcomed their daughter Tiggy Heart on November 21. Tiggy Eckersley was born in Newcastle Private Hospital at 3.50 pm, weighed 3.18 kg (7 lb), and was 51.5 cm long. Tiggy has a big brother named Harry, aged 5, from a previous relationship of Adam’s.\n\nBrooke has been performing in public since she was 11, when she won a local talent contest, and has written songs for Kate DeAraugo and Olivia Newton-John. Her first song, I Can’t Wait, was released in 2002, and was covered by Hilary Duff for the Disney show, Lizzie McGuire. In 2006, Brooke formed a band called The McClymonts with her sisters Samantha and Mollie, and they have been performing together ever since.\n\nAdam made the finals of the 2009 season of Australian Idol, after already winning several awards for blues/roots music. This year he signed with his first major record label. Brooke and Adam were married on Adam’s parents’ country property in the country music capital, Tamworth, in 2009. They honeymooned in Tasmania.\n\nBrooke and Adam were considering the name Tiger for their baby girl, but went with Tiggy instead as a bit of a spin on it."
