It originated as the transferred use of a surname from the Olde English “bróc” referring to a brook or stream. The surname would have been assigned to people who dwelled near a brook or stream as a means of identification (surnames were either derived from place names, topographical features, names passed from the father, occupations and nicknames). In this case, the surname likely developed from a topographical feature of the landscape (which included a flowing stream of water). Some etymologists have theorized that Brooke may have also developed as an occupation surname from the Medieval Norman-French “broc” meaning “pitcher” (in describing one who delivered fresh water from a jug of some sort). Such an occupation would have been held by a woman, in which case Brooke would be considered one of the few matronymic surnames (i.e., passed from the mother rather than the father). The first recorded spelling of this surname appeared in Essex in the early 12th century and was rendered as “Broc”. Aside from “brook” being a “stream”, it is also a verb meaning “to endure, tolerate”, originally derived from the more favorable Proto-Indo-European root *bhrūg- meaning “to make use of, enjoy” (Pok. 173), in the sense of eating and digesting food. The verb’s modern meaning of “tolerance” came from “to stomach something” in the late 16th century. As a female given name, Brooke is quite popular throughout the English-speaking world. It’s ranked highest in Scotland and Northern Ireland, followed by England, Ireland, Canada and the United States.\n\nAll About the Baby Name – Brooke\n\nPersonality\n\nOF THE GIRL NAME BROOKE\n\nThe Three energy is powerful and enthusiastic. These personalities are cheerful, full of self-expression, and often quite emotional. They have an artistic flair and \"gift-of-gab\" that makes them natural entertainers. Their joyfulness bubbles over, and their infectious exuberance draws a crowd. The Three personality is like a child - forever young and full of delight. They are charming, witty, and generally happy people. The Three personality lives in the \"now\" and has a spontaneous nature. Threes seem to live with a bright and seemingly unbreakable aura that attracts others to them. In turn, they are deeply loyal and loving to their friends and family. Luck also has a tendency to favor number Threes.\n\nPopularity\n\nOF THE GIRL NAME BROOKE\n\nThe name Brooke didn’t really come into circulation in the United States until the 1950s, most likely influenced by the very wealthy New York socialite/philanthropist Brooke Astor who lent her name some aristocratic cachet. However, it was really Brooke Shields who garnered the name the most notice in the late 1970s and early 80s. It was then that Brooke surged to the top of the charts, landing a coveted spot on America’s Top 100 list in 1979. Her best year ever was 2003 when Brooke was the 43rd most popular baby girl’s name in the country. Just recently, in 2012, Brooke slipped off America’s Top 100 list – her popularity having been replaced by the über-trendy Brooklyn. Brooke is a strong sounding one-syllable name that still manages to imbue a sense of gentleness. When we hear the name, we envision the soft, Zen sound of water as it flows gently down a brook.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nON BROOKE\n\nGENDER:\n\nGirl\n\nORIGIN:\n\nEnglish\n\nNUMBER OF SYLLABLES:\n\n1\n\nRANKING POPULARITY:\n\n113\n\nPRONUNCIATION:\n\nBROOK\n\nSIMPLE MEANING:\n\nSmall stream\n\nCharacteristics\n\nOF BROOKE\n\nCommunicative\n\nCreative\n\nOptimistic\n\nPopular\n\nSocial\n\nDramatic\n\nHappy\n\nCultural References to the Baby Name – Brooke\n\nLiterary Characters\n\nOF THE BABY NAME BROOKE\n\nWe have not found any significant literary references for Brooke.\n\nChildrens Books\n\nON THE BABY NAME BROOKE\n\nWe cannot find any childrens books with the first name Brooke\n\nPopular Songs\n\nON BROOKE\n\nBrookeâ€™s Lullaby\n\na song by The Teddybears\n\nFamous People\n\nNAMED BROOKE\n\nBrooke Shields (actress)\n\nBrooke Astor (socialite/philanthropist)\n\nBrooke Adams (actress)\n\nBrooke Burke (TV personality)\n\nBrooke Langton (actress)\n\nChildren of Famous People\n\nNAMED BROOKE\n\nWe cannot find any children of famous people with the first name Brooke\n\nHistoric Figures\n\nWITH THE NAME BROOKE\n\nWe have not found any significant historical figures with the first name Brooke."
