        "text": "Born in Fort Wayne, Indiana on February 8, 1949, Julia Barr is most famous for her role as Brooke English on the ABC daytime drama All My Children. Barr played the character from 1976 until 1981 and from 1982 until she exited the show on December 20, 2006.\n\nBarr broke into the soap world at 27 years old with a short stint as bad girl Serena “Reenie” Szabo on the ABC soap Ryan’s Hope in 1976, but later that year was asked to join All My Children, and the rest is history as they say. She won two Daytime Emmy awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1990 and 1998 for her portrayal of Brooke English.\n\n\"The core of good storytelling and acting is the heart of a good soap opera\"\n\nThe actress has been married to Dr. Richard Hirschlag since 1982 and their daughter Allison played Lizzie Spaulding on the now defunct CBS drama Guiding Light in 2002.\n\nThe actress is currently working on an Internet series with Jill Larson (Opal on All My Children), about three women who are at a point in their lives where they are without their male companions for various reasons. She returns to her role as Brooke English on All My Children, starting on February 23.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Julia, congratulations on the return visit to All My Children! Personally, Is this something that has been in the works for a while or were you asked to return when you taped the 40th anniversary episode?\n\nJulia Barr: Thank you very much. Being asked back was really nice. It occurred after I taped the 40th anniversary show (which I taped in early December) and had nothing to do with that appearance. This is something that worked out in conjunction with a storyline they started writing late in December.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Are you planning on staying in Pine Valley for a while?\n\nJulia Barr: For now I’ll be there for a few months … but stay tuned! Anything can happen.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): You will be commuting from New Jersey to LA now that AMC has relocated?\n\nJulia Barr: Yes, I’ll commute to and from the east coast and my husband will come and visit me when he can.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Can you give us any spoilers concerning Brooke’s new storyline?\n\nJulia Barr: Can’t say a word! Sorry!\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): When last we saw Brooke, she was a mourner at Simone Torres’ funeral. I believe since then they have said that Brooke has been living in China with Laura. Will the character of Laura return with Brooke?\n\nJulia Barr: I don’t think they have plans to bring Laura back right now. And I think Brooke was visiting China but not living there … these things seem to change in terms of back-story! I can’t keep up.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Fans have been wondering what happened to Tempo. Will Brooke continue to work for the magazine?\n\nJulia Barr: I hope so. I think so!\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Do you keep in touch with Richard Shoberg who played Tom Cudahy on AMC? I always thought there was great chemistry between Brooke and Tom. Is there any chance of bringing him back?\n\nJulia Barr: I never know what the show has planned and who they bring back or let go … I am in touch with Richard, though.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Who would you like to see her paired with romantically?\n\nJulia Barr: Tad, Adam, David! Any of those would be more than fine by me!\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): You left All My Children in December of 2006. Many actors opt to go on recurring status (if given the choice) rather than completely leave the soap. Why did you decide to leave?\n\nJulia Barr: I felt like the time was right to take a break after 30 years. I also was unhappy with the direction they took the character and not having any story for such a long period of time.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Megan McTavish (head writer off and on from 1992 until 2007) was criticized for \"killing off\" Dixie Cooney Martin in 2007 and for reversing the landmark storyline of Erica’s abortion. Was it her decision not to give your character any goodbye scenes before you left about three years ago?\n\nJulia Barr: I don’t know why – or who – it was decided to not give Brooke any closure. It was sad for me and I know it was very difficult for fans.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): I recently interviewed Daniel Kennedy (Petey Cortlandt). He was let go and not given any goodbye scenes (although he requested the scenes since he had an ongoing relationship with Colby). His character was just mentioned a few days ago as being gone. Do you think this happens in soaps because the writers do not care about the characters as much as the storylines?\n\nJulia Barr: I can’t speak for the writers or producers. I know that there are so many people involved in these decisions and so many reasons why things happen. I stopped trying to figure it all out.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): You began your soap career on Ryan’s Hope that aired from 1975 until 1989. What would you say are the major differences between soaps in the 1970s and the current soaps of today?\n\nJulia Barr: Soaps keep trying to reinvent themselves and viewers have so many choices on television now … and so little time in this fast paced world and working full time. But the core of good storytelling and acting is the heart of a good soap opera and I believe still there on the few shows left.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): With Guiding Light gone and As the World Turns going in September, do you think that All My Children could be next, or has the move to LA “saved” the show for now?\n\nJulia Barr: This is a question for the television executives, not me. I’d like to see AMC on forever!\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Do you see a future without soaps?\n\nJulia Barr: It would be a very sad turn for the entertainment industry and for our culture at large. I hope that never happens. It is a long-standing art form and I hope there will always be an audience who has the time and interest to watch.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Tell me how you first became interested in animal welfare groups.\n\nJulia Barr: I have been doing hands-on work and direct care for an animal rescue organization in New Jersey called Save the Animal Rescue Team II.\n\nI was spokesperson for The Fund for Animals from 2001 until they merged with The Humane Society of the United States in 2005. When the two groups merged, I continued supporting The Fund through The Humane Society of the United States and continue to help spread the word.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): What pets do you have now?\n\nJulia Barr: We have a mixed-breed dog named Lucy, and cats Ned and Margaret. They’re the best adopted pets we could ever have!\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Please tell us about your other charity work.\n\nJulia Barr: I’ve spent several years as an active volunteer for The Coalition for the Homeless’ First Step program in New York, worked with the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and I'm on the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Other than AMC, do you have any new projects going on personally or professionally?\n\nJulia Barr: I have a web project I’ve been working on with Jill Larson, my animal charity work, and our household of pets! I love traveling and spending time with my family. That has all kept me really busy.\n\nMelissa Parker (Smashing Interviews Magazine): Julia, if this was your last day on earth, how would you spend it?\n\nJulia Barr: I would spend it with the two people I love most in the world, my daughter and my husband.\n\n© 2010 Smashing Interviews Magazine.
