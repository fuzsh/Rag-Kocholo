It is a powerful teaching method as it is based on the principles of how children learn. It enables children to imitate the language they need for a particular topic orally, before recording and analysing it, and then writing their own version.\n\nThe Talk for Writing approach enables children to read and write independently for a variety of audiences and purposes within different subjects. A key feature is that children internalise the language structures needed to write through ‘talking the text’ as well as close reading. The approach moves from dependence towards independence with the teacher using shared and guided teaching to develop the ability in children to write creatively and powerfully. The focus texts that are used to deliver the Talk for Writing approach include a range of fiction, non – fiction and poetry.\n\nEnglish at Brooke Priory"
