        "text": "See also en:Wikipedia:Vital articles/Expanded and en:Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Core topics. This page is an expanded version of List of articles every Wikipedia should have. The goal of the list is to represent 10,000 articles on the most notable topics in different fields of knowledge and human activity. As it is difficult to compare notability of topics in different fields of knowledge, the list is based on Quotas for every topic. Please note that a clean-up might be needed in some sectors, as well as some quotas fine-tuning.\n\nThis list is composed of a series of lists that use the transclusion process combined. You cannot edit the entire list at once, only single sections. If a name or subsection needs to be moved to a different list (\"fictional people\" was moved from Arts to People), you must craft it out of one list, then open up the target list, and paste it there. Here are the links to the lists as separately editable:\n\nThis list is also used to obtain the List of Wikipedias by expanded sample of articles.
