Microtubules function in many essential cellular processes, including mitosis. Tubulin-binding drugs kill cancerous cells by inhibiting microtubule dynamics, which are required for DNA segregation and therefore cell division. , there are six members of the tubulin superfamily, although not all are present in all species. Both α and β tubulins have a mass of around 50 kDa and are thus in a similar range compared to actin (with a mass of ~42 kDa). In contrast, tubulin polymers (microtubules) tend to be much bigger than actin filaments due to their cylindrical nature. Tubulin was long thought to be specific to eukaryotes. More recently, however, several prokaryotic proteins have been shown to be related to tubulin. <human>: What are some examples of drugs that bind to tubulin? <bot>: These include paclitaxel, colchicine, and the \"vinca\" alkaloids, each of which have a distinct binding site on β-tubulin. <human>: Are there any other examples? <bot>: In addition, the anti-worm drug albendazole selectively targets the colchicine site in worm, but not human or \"Drosophilia\", β-Tubulin. <human>: What is another specific example of a drug that binds to tubulin? <bot>: Class III β-tubulin is a microtubule element expressed exclusively in neurons, and is a popular identifier specific for neurons in nervous tissue. <human>: What is the difference between class III and other isotypes? <bot>: It binds colchicine much more slowly than other isotypes of β-tubulin. <human>: Are there six classes of isotypes? <bot>: β1-tubulin, sometimes called class VI β-tubulin, is the most divergent at the amino acid sequence level. <human>: What are the functions of the different isotypes? <bot>: It is expressed exclusively in megakaryocytes and platelets in humans and appears to play an important role in the formation of platelets.\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\nBackground: Polka-style medleys of cover songs are a distinguishing part of American musician, satirist, parodist, and songwriter \\\"Weird Al\\\" Yankovic's catalog. Twelve of his fourteen albums contain them; his self-titled debut and Even Worse omit them. The medleys are composed of various popular songs, each one reinterpreted as a polka (generally an instrumentation of accordion, banjo, tuba, clarinet, and muted brass interspersed with sound effects) with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect and profane lyrics are covered with cartoon sound effects. Yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was \\\". ..the way God intended.\\\" Yankovic said that the medleys were something he did \\\"even before I had a record deal\\\" in live performances, and that many of the songs are included due to not receiving a full parody version - \\\"if there’s a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll end up in the polka medley. \\\" Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, \\\"At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley.\\\" Yankovic has always asked permission from every artist whose songs compose a medley due to royalties issues. He acknowledged some influence of Spike Jones in the medleys, such as the sound effects. Three of Yankovic's polka medleys—\\\"Hooked on Polkas\\\", \\\"Polka Power!\\\", and \\\"The Hamilton Polka\\\"—have been released as singles (either in international markets or domestically). \\\"Polka Your Eyes Out\\\" and \\\"Polkas on 45\\\" were also the only polkas to appear on a greatest hits album and \\\"Polka Face\\\" is the only polka to have an official video released for it that are not clips of the original songs music videos. <human>: Tell me about List of The Apprentice candidates (British series 4). <bot>: Polka-style medleys of cover songs are a distinguishing part of American musician, satirist, parodist, and songwriter \\\"Weird Al\\\" Yankovic's catalog. <human>: What happened with Lucinda on British series 4? <bot>: On \"The Apprentice: Why I fired them\", Sir Alan Sugar praised Lucinda as having \"exceptional skill\", and felt that she would have been \"fantastic\" in the role of working for him, but explained that he did not feel that she would have been willing to apply her mind to the job. <human>: What did she do after the show? <bot>: Since leaving the programme, Ledgerwood has expressed interest in a career in the media and in herbal medicine, which she studies part-time at Edinburgh Napier University. <human>: tell me more <bot>: She has also served as a BBC assistant presenter at Royal Ascot 2008, and as a cover host for Danny Baker's slot on BBC Radio London 94.9.

In the 930s, he was at the court of King Æthelstan of England (r. 924–39). After Æthelstan's death, Israel successfully sought the patronage of Archbishop Rotbert of Trier and became tutor to Bruno, later the Archbishop of Cologne. In the late 940s Israel is recorded as a bishop, and at the end of his life he was a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Maximin in Trier.

The highway extends 14. 3 miles (23. 0 km) from Maryland Route 25 (MD 25) in Brooklandville east to MD 7 near White Marsh. Joppa Road has three main segments separated by very short breaks on its course through central and eastern Baltimore County. The central segment is a multi-lane highway from MD 45 and MD 146 in the county seat of Towson to U. S. Route 1 (US 1) in Perry Hall. This highway is mostly a commercial strip and parallels Interstate 695 (I-695) through Towson, Parkville, and Carney. The western and eastern segments of Joppa Road are two-lane roads through mainly residential areas. The western segment connects Brooklandville and Towson via Riderwood. The eastern segment serves parts of Perry Hall and White Marsh. Joppa Road and its western complement, Old Court Road, have been a cross-county highway since the 17th century. This highway connected the western part of the county to its original county seat of Joppa, which was sited on the Gunpowder River near the modern community of Joppatowne. The western segment connects Brooklandville and Towson via Riderwood. The state-maintained segment of the highway between Towson and Perry Hall was designated Maryland Route 148. MD 148 was widened in the mid-1930s and again in the late 1930s and 1940s. The highway's role as the primary east–west highway of Baltimore's northern suburbs was superseded by the construction of I-695 in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Allegheny Avenue later became MD 141 and was removed from the state highway system in 1961. <human>: Is Joppa Road in any kind of trouble? <bot>: Joppa Road between US 1 and MD 147 was constructed by the state as a concrete road in 1925 and 1926. <human>: Is there anything else you can tell me about Joppa Road? <bot>: That road, which became MD 148, was the final link in the state and county construction of a hard-surface circumferential highway from Eastern Avenue (MD 150) to Liberty Road (MD 26).\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\nBackground: The Kanem–Bornu Empire existed in areas which are now part of Niger, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, and Nigeria. It was known to the Arabian geographers as the Kanem Empire from the 8th century AD onward and lasted as the independent kingdom of Bornu (the Bornu Empire) until 1900. The Kanem Empire (c. 700–1380) was located in the present countries of Chad, Nigeria and Libya. At its height, it encompassed an area covering not only most of Chad but also parts of southern Libya (Fezzan) and eastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon. The Bornu Empire (1380s–1893) was a state in what is now northeastern Nigeria, in time becoming even larger than Kanem, incorporating areas that are today parts of Chad, Niger, Sudan, and Cameroon. The early history of the empire is mainly known from the Royal Chronicle, or Girgam, discovered in 1851 by the German traveller Heinrich Barth. Remnant successor regimes of the empire, in form of the Borno Emirate and Dikwa Emirate, were established around 1900 and still exist today as traditional states within Nigeria. <human>: Briefly describe Kanem–Bornu Empire. <bot>: The Kanem–Bornu Empire existed in areas which are now part of Niger, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, and Nigeria. <human>: When did the Kanem-Bornu Empire reach its peak? <bot>: Bornu peaked during the reign of Mai Idris Alooma (c. 1571–1603), reaching the limits of its greatest territorial expansion, gaining control over Hausaland, and the people of Ahir and Tuareg. <human>: Did they go to war to achieve this? <bot>: Peace was made with Bulala, when a demarcation of boundaries was agreed, upon with a non-aggression pact. <human>: What were some of the innovations during this time? <bot>: Military innovations included the use of mounted Turkish musketeers, slave musketeers, mailed cavalrymen, and footmen. <human>: What else did you find interesting? <bot>: This army was organized into an advance guard and a rear reserve, transported via camel or large boats and fed by free and slave women cooks. <human>: How well did they do with this system? <bot>: Military tactics were honed by drill and organization, supplemented with a scorched earth policy. \" Ribāts\" were built on frontiers, and trade routes to the north were secure, allowing friendly relations to be established with the Pasha of Tripoli and the Turkish empire. <human>: What other accomplishments did they have? <bot>: Ibn Furtu called Alooma Amir al-Mu'minin, after he implemented Sharia, and relied upon large fiefholders to ensure justice.\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\nBackground: Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni), also known as the northern two-toed sloth is a species of sloth from Central and South America.

The class represented the penultimate stage in the development of the Southern Railway's 2-6-0 \\\"family\\\", which improved upon the basic principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward for Great Western Railway (GWR) locomotives. The U class design drew from experience with the GWR 4300s and N classes, improved by applying Midland Railway ideas to the design, enabling the SECR to influence development of the 2-6-0 in Britain. The U class was designed in the mid-1920s for production at a time when more obsolete 4-4-0 locomotives were withdrawn, and derived from Maunsell's earlier SECR K (“River”) class 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The first 20 members of the U class were rebuilds of the K class locomotives, one of which was involved in the Sevenoaks railway accident. A further 20 U class locomotives were built in 1928 to fill the gap in cross-country and semi-fast express passenger services after the withdrawal of the K class. The design also continued the standardisation of the Southern Railway locomotive fleet by using parts designed to be interchangeable with other Maunsell-designed classes. A total of 50 locomotives were built over three batches between 1928 and 1931, and the design formed the basis for the 3-cylinder U1 class of 1928. They were able to operate over most of the Southern Railway network, gaining the nickname \\\"U-boats\\\" after the submarine warfare of the First World War, and continued to operate with British Railways (BR). The class saw continuous use until 1966, when all members of the U class were withdrawn from service.

The route begins at an intersection with NY 28 in the town of Shandaken, just southwest of the hamlet of Phoenicia. The route runs through the narrow mountain pass called Stony Clove Notch before reaching the town of Hunter, where it ends at NY 23A. NY 214 was part of a tannery road constructed by Colonel William Edwards of Hunter in the late 1840s, opening by 1849. The road was upgraded in 1873 to the Stoney Clove Turnpike, which serviced hotels and resorts in the Catskills. In 1930, the route was designated as NY 214, but the part in Greene County was not state-maintained, instead by the county. From 1946 to 1956, the residents of the hamlet of Lanesville spent time fighting for NY 214 to be reconstructed due to being an unsafe dirt road for their children to attend school using their bus. After two sections were completed by 1952, the last section in Greene County was a political debate for four years over the New York State Department of Public Works delaying the project for a multitude of reasons. Construction of the final section finally commenced on July 16, 1956. In 1994, it was proposed that NY 214 become part of a scenic byway and in 2013, the state of New York approved a bill creating the Mountain Cloves Scenic Byway, which is a 41-mile (66 km) byway with multiple branches serving the Catskill Mountains. <human>: Tell me about New York State Route 214. <bot>: New York State Route 214 (NY 214) is a 12. <human>: What happened in New York in 1954? <bot>: On August 24, the Department of Public Works noted a letter to the parents committee noting that NY 214 had been placed on the 1955 program for construction, like it had three years prior. <human>: more please <bot>: The state also noted that they would do survey and design during the winter of 1954–1955 and then move the project to the contract stage in 1955. <human>: Did anything happen in 1955? <bot>: By late December 1954, the district engineer for the state noted that the work would be able to be contracted by April 1. <human>: Did it ever get contracted? <bot>: However, plans were not sent to the state until late July 1955 to the main office in Albany. <human>: What happened after it was sent? <bot>: To make things worse, the defeat of a $750 million road bond amendment in November 1955 would potentially delay the work on NY 214 even further. <human>: Did it get delayed? <bot>: Stating more run-around by the state, John Papp, the chair of the parents committee noted that the letting proposal for a contract was to start December 1, 1955, but defeating the amendment changed plans, even though part of the road was severely damaged in a storm on October 16.\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\nBackground: The Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram is a collection of 7th- and 8th-century CE religious monuments in the coastal resort town of Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, India and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

En route to the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Nixon faced challenges from Governor George Romney of Michigan, Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, Governor Ronald Reagan of California, and Senator Charles Percy of Illinois. Nixon won nine of the thirteen state primaries held that season, although due to the population of his state, Governor Reagan won the popular vote while carrying only California. These victories, along with pledged delegate support from states not holding primaries, secured Nixon the nomination on the first ballot of the Republican National Convention, where he named Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland as his running mate. In the general election, Nixon emphasized \\\"law and order\\\", positioning himself as the champion of what he called the \\\"silent majority\\\". Running well ahead of his opponent, incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey, his support slipped in the polls following his refusal to partake in presidential debates, and following an announcement from President Lyndon B. Johnson that a halt in the bombing of Vietnam had been negotiated. Winning a close election on November 5, 1968, Nixon and Agnew were inaugurated as the 37th president of the United States and 39th vice president of the United States, respectively, on January 20, 1969.

Its disadvantage was that the bars to which the lids were attached meant they could only be opened individually. \\n* In 1951 the sliding-roof wagon was built, whereby half the loading area could be opened up and loaded from above without obstruction at one time. This was achieved by sliding one half of the two-part roof over the other. \\n* In 1958 came the swing-roof wagon which enabled the entire loading area to be opened up by swinging the roof out on the longer side of the wagon. Its disadvantage is that, in some variants, the opened roof does not fit within the loading gauge and can thus block a neighbouring track. \\n* The latest development is the rolling roof wagon that entered service in 1973. Its plastic rolling roof can be completely rolled up at one end enabling the entire wagon to be loaded from above.

The city is also the seat of the eponymous Municipality. It is located in the northwest corner of the Yucatán Peninsula, about 35 km (22 mi) inland from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2020 it had a population of 921,770 while its metropolitan area, which also includes Umán Municipality and Kanasín Municipality, had a population of 1,316,090. The city's rich cultural heritage is a product of the syncretism of the Maya and Spanish cultures during the colonial era. It was the first city to be ever named American Capital of Culture and is the only city that has received the title twice. The Cathedral of Mérida, Yucatán was built in the late 16th century with stones from nearby Mayan ruins and is known to be the oldest cathedral in the mainland Americas. In addition, the city has the third largest old town district on the continent. In 2007, the city was visited by former U.S. President George W. Bush to meet with the ex-president of Mexico Felipe Calderón for the historic creation of the Mérida Initiative. Mérida is often considered the safest city of Mexico and one of the safest cities in the Americas. In 2019 it hosted the 17th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, receiving more than 30 of them. It is a City of Gastronomy as part of the UNESCO's Creative Cities Network. The UN-Habitat's City Prosperity Index recognized Mérida as the best city to live in Mexico for its high quality of life. The city was certified as an International Safe Community by the Karolinska Institute of Sweden for its high level of public security. Forbes magazine has ranked Mérida three different times as one of the three best cities in Mexico to live, invest and do business. <human>: What were the diverse cultures that made up the city of Mérida, Yucatán? <bot>: These first Korean migrants settled around Mérida as workers in henequen plantations. <human>: What is the city's main historical district called? <bot>: Mérida has one of the largest \"centro histórico\" districts in the Americas (surpassed only by Mexico City and Havana, Cuba). <human>: continue <bot>: Colonial homes line the city streets to this day, in various states of disrepair and renovation; the historical center of Mérida is currently undergoing a minor renaissance as more and more people are moving into the old buildings and reviving their former glory. <human>: Did any famous people live in or visit the city? <bot>: In August 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the city on his third trip to Mexico. <human>: Did any other important people visit the city? <bot>: The city has been host to two bilateral United States – Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 (Bill Clinton – Ernesto Zedillo) and the second in 2007 (George W.

Jewish surnames are thought to be of comparatively recent origin; the first known Jewish family names date to the Middle Ages, in the 10th and 11th centuries CE. Jews have some of the largest varieties of surnames among any ethnic group, owing to the geographically diverse Jewish diaspora, as well as cultural assimilation and the recent trend toward Hebraization of surnames. Some traditional surnames relate to Jewish history or roles within the religion, such as Cohen (\\\"priest\\\"), Levi, Shulman (\\\"synagogue-man\\\"), Sofer (\\\"scribe\\\"), or Kantor (\\\"cantor\\\"), while many others relate to a secular occupation or place names. The majority of Jewish surnames used today developed in the past three hundred years. <human>: What are some of the more common Jewish surnames? <bot>: David Cassel), Treves (whence, according to some authorities, originated the very popular Alsatian name of Dreyfus), Dresden, Fulda (hence Foulde), and Oppenheim; others, to less familiar towns, like Auerbach, Bischoffsheim, Utting am Ammersee (hence Utting), Hildesheim (Hildesheimer), Landshuth, Sulzberg. House signs such as those in the \"Frankfurter Judengasse\" gave rise to the names of some of the best known of Jewish families: Rothschild (\"red shield\"), Schwarzschild (\"black shield\"), Adler (\"eagle\"), Ganz or Gans (\"goose\"), Strauß (\"ostrich\"), and Ochs (\"ox\"). <human>: Where did some of these surnames come from? <bot>: Some names may seem to be derived artificially, but can also refer to towns, e.g., Birnbaum (translated into \"Peartree\"), Rosenberg, Kornberg, Sommerfeld, Grünberg (hence Greenberg), Goldberg, and Rubinstein/Rubenstein. <human>: tell me more <bot>: The English Crawcour (cf. <human>: What other surnames are common? <bot>: Siegfried Kracauer) comes from Cracow, while \"van Praag(h)\" is the name of a Prague family that settled in the Netherlands before going over to England. <human>: Any other honorable mentions? <bot>: The name Gordon may in some cases be derived from the Russian Grodno but is also said to have been adopted by Jews in the Russian Empire in honor of Lord George Gordon (1751–1793), a Scottish nobleman who converted to Judaism in 1787 in Birmingham. <human>: What other countries have influenced the surnames? <bot>: From Poland have come names such as Polano, Pollock, Polack, Polak, Pollak, Poole, Pool, and Polk.\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\n<human>: Provide an article about The physiology, discussing in detail marine vertebrates, red blood cells in four paragraphs. <bot>: The physiology of underwater diving is the physiological adaptations to diving of air-breathing vertebrates that have returned to the ocean from terrestrial lineages. They are a diverse group that include sea snakes, sea turtles, the marine iguana, saltwater crocodiles, penguins, pinnipeds, cetaceans, sea otters, manatees and dugongs. All known diving vertebrates dive to feed, and the extent of the diving in terms of depth and duration are influenced by feeding strategies, but also, in some cases, with predator avoidance. Diving behaviour is inextricably linked with the physiological adaptations for diving and often the behaviour leads to an investigation of the physiology that makes the behaviour possible, so they are considered together where possible. Most diving vertebrates make relatively short shallow dives. Sea snakes, crocodiles, and marine iguanas only dive in inshore waters and seldom dive deeper than 10 meters (33 feet). Some of these groups can make much deeper and longer dives. Emperor penguins regularly dive to depths of 400 to 500 meters (1,300 to 1,600 feet) for 4 to 5 minutes, often dive for 8 to 12 minutes, and have a maximum endurance of about 22 minutes. Elephant seals stay at sea for between 2 and 8 months and dive continuously, spending 90% of their time underwater and averaging 20 minutes per dive with less than 3 minutes at the surface between dives. Their maximum dive duration is about 2 hours and they routinely feed at depths between 300 and 600 meters (980 and 1,970 feet), though they can exceed depths of 1,600 meters (5,200 feet). Beaked whales have been found to routinely dive to forage at depths between 835 and 1,070 meters (2,740 and 3,510 feet), and remain submerged for about 50 minutes. Their maximum recorded depth is 1,888 meters (6,194 feet), and the maximum duration is 85 minutes. Air-breathing marine vertebrates that dive to feed must deal with the effects of pressure at depth, hypoxia during apnea, and the need to find and capture their food. Adaptations to diving can be associated with these three requirements. Adaptations to pressure must deal with the mechanical effects of pressure on gas-filled cavities, solubility changes of gases under pressure, and possible direct effects of pressure on the metabolism, while adaptations to breath-hold capacity include modifications to metabolism, perfusion, carbon dioxide tolerance, and oxygen storage capacity. Adaptations to find and capture food vary depending on the food, but deep-diving generally involves operating in a dark environment. Diving vertebrates have increased the amount of oxygen stored in their internal tissues. This oxygen store has three components; oxygen contained in the air in the lungs, oxygen stored by haemoglobin in the blood, and by myoglobin, in muscle tissue, The muscle and blood of diving vertebrates have greater concentrations of haemoglobin and myoglobin than terrestrial animals. Myoglobin concentration in locomotor muscles of diving vertebrates is up to 30 times more than in terrestrial relatives. Haemoglobin is increased by both a relatively larger amount of blood and a larger proportion of red blood cells in the blood compared with terrestrial animals. Adaptations to find and capture food vary depending on the food, but deep-diving generally involves operating in a dark environment. Body size is a factor in diving ability. A larger body mass correlates to a relatively lower metabolic rate, while oxygen storage is directly proportional to body mass, so larger animals should be able to dive for longer, all other things being equal. Swimming efficiency also affects diving ability, as low drag and high propulsive efficiency requires less energy for the same dive. Myoglobin concentration in locomotor muscles of diving vertebrates is up to 30 times more than in terrestrial relatives. Adaptations to find and capture food vary depending on the food, but deep-diving generally involves operating in a dark environment. They are not specific to immersion in water, but are protective mechanisms against asphyxia which are common to all mammals but more effective and developed in seals. The extent to which these responses are expressed depends greatly on the seal's anticipation of dive duration.The regulation of bradycardia and vasoconstriction of the dive response in both mammals and diving ducks can be triggered by facial immersion, wetting of the nostrils and glottis, or stimulation of trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerves.Animals cannot convert fats to glucose, and in many diving animals, carbohydrates are not readily available from the diet, nor stored in large quantities, so as they are essential for anaerobic metabolism, they could be a limiting factor. Decompression sickness (DCS) is a disease associated with metabolically inert gas uptake at pressure, and its subsequent release into the tissues in the form of bubbles. Marine mammals were thought to be relatively immune to DCS due to anatomical, physiological and behavioural adaptations that reduce tissue loading with dissolved nitrogen during dives, but observations show that gas bubbles may form, and tissue injury may occur under certain circumstances. Decompression modelelling using measured dive profiles predict the possibility of high blood and tissue nitrogen tensions. <human>: What is meant by barotrauma? <bot>: When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure: The initial damage is usually due to over-stretching the tissues in tension or shear, either directly by expansion of the gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue. <human>: next <bot>: Tissue rupture may be complicated by the introduction of gas into the local tissue or circulation through the initial trauma site, which can cause blockage of circulation at distant sites, or interfere with normal function of an organ by its presence. <human>: How do the different levels of damage compare? <bot>: Barotrauma generally manifests as sinus or middle ear effects, decompression sickness (DCS), lung overpressure injuries, and injuries resulting from external squeezes. <human>: What are the most common types of barotraumas? <bot>: Barotraumas of descent are caused by preventing the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the gas space, and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture. <human>: What other types are there? <bot>: Barotraumas of ascent are also caused when the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver is prevented. <human>: What are the symptoms of each type? <bot>: In this case the pressure difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength.\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\nBackground: In science and research, an attribute is a quality of an object (person, thing, etc.). Attributes are closely related to variables. A variable is a logical set of attributes. Variables can \\\"vary\\\" – for example, be high or low. How high, or how low, is determined by the value of the attribute (and in fact, an attribute could be just the word \\\"low\\\" or \\\"high\\\"). (For example see: Binary option) While an attribute is often intuitive, the variable is the operationalized way in which the attribute is represented for further data processing. In data processing data are often represented by a combination of items (objects organized in rows), and multiple variables (organized in columns). Values of each variable statistically \\\"vary\\\" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain. A domain is a set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have. The values are ordered in a logical way and must be defined for each variable. Domains can be bigger or smaller. The smallest possible domains have those variables that can only have two values, also called binary (or dichotomous) variables. Bigger domains have non-dichotomous variables and the ones with a higher level of measurement. (See also domain of discourse.) Semantically, greater precision can be obtained when considering an object's characteristics by distinguishing 'attributes' (characteristics that are attributed to an object) from 'traits' (characteristics that are inherent to the object). <human>: Briefly describe Variable and attribute (research). <bot>: In science and research, an attribute is a quality of an object (person, thing, etc. <human>: What is the difference between new york style cheesecake and regular cheesecake? <bot>: Variable and attribute (research) In science and research, an attribute is a characteristic of an object (person, thing, etc.).

At the post-war Nuremberg trials, the Waffen-SS was declared to be a criminal organisation due to its major involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. The division was developed around the nucleus of an ethnic Albanian battalion which had briefly seen combat against the Yugoslav Partisans in eastern Bosnia as part of the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). Composed of Albanians with mostly German and Yugoslav Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) officers and non-commissioned officers, it was given the title Skanderbeg after medieval Albanian lord George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, who defended the region of Albania against the Ottoman Empire for more than two decades in the 15th century. Skanderbeg never reached divisional strength, being at most a brigade-sized formation of between 6,000 and 6,500 troops. In May 1944, members of the division arrested 281 Jews in Pristina and handed them over to the Germans, who transported them to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. The division itself was better known for this action and for murdering, raping, and looting in predominantly Serb areas than for participating in combat operations on behalf of the German war effort. Its only significant military actions took place during a German anti-Partisan offensive in the German occupied territory of Montenegro in June and July 1944. Following those operations, the unit was deployed as a guard force at the chromium mines in Kosovo, where it was quickly overrun by the Partisans, leading to widespread desertion. Reinforced by German Kriegsmarine personnel and with fewer than 500 Albanians remaining in its ranks, it was disbanded on 1 November 1944. The remaining members were incorporated into the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. After the war, divisional commander SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS August Schmidhuber was found guilty of war crimes by a court in Belgrade and executed in 1947. <human>: Provide one sentence about 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg. <bot>: The 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian) was a German mountain infantry division of the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside, but was never formally part of, the Wehrmacht during World War II. <human>: When did the Italian troops leave Albania? <bot>: Albania remained occupied by Italy until its surrender to the Allies in September 1943. <human>: What happened when the troops left the area? <bot>: In August of that year, faced with the imminent collapse of the Italian war effort, Germany deployed the 2nd Panzer Army to the Balkans to take over areas previously occupied by Italy. <human>: Did the 2nd Panzer Army take control of the area? <bot>: One of the Italian areas seized by the Germans was Albania, where the XXI Mountain Corps of \"Generaloberst\" Lothar Rendulic's 2nd Panzer Army had been deployed. <human>: What did the Germans do to take control of Albania? <bot>: A Wehrmacht plenipotentiary general, and a special representative of Heinrich Himmler, SS-\"Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei\" Josef Fitzthum, were both based in the Albanian capital of Tirana. <human>: What else did they do to take control of the area? <bot>: The Germans took control of all Albanian forces that had been collaborating with the Italians prior to their capitulation, including the \"Balli Kombëtar\", an anti-communist and nationalist militia. <human>: Did they subdue the people? <bot>: The Germans strengthened the Albanian army and gendarmerie, but quickly decided those troops were unreliable.\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\n<human>: Write me an article about LanguageTool Plus, Microsoft Office in three paragraphs. <bot>: LanguageTool is a free and open-source grammar, , and spell checker, and all its features are available for download.

The story is set at the end of the Dutch colonial rule and was written while Pramoedya was imprisoned on the political island prison of Buru in eastern Indonesia. The story was first narrated verbally to Pramoedya's fellow prisoners in 1973 because he did not get permission to write. The story spread through all the inmates until 1975 when Pramoedya was finally granted permission to write the detailed story. The central character and the narrator of This Earth of Mankind is a Javanese boy, Minke, who is fortunate to attend an elite Dutch school because he is a descendant of Javanese royalty (the character is based on Tirto Adhi Soerjo). Minke faces a complex and dangerous world when he meets Nyai Ontosoroh, a njai or concubine of a Dutch man. Minke's life becomes more dangerous when he falls in love with Annelies, the beautiful Indo daughter of Nyai Ontosoroh. In This Earth of Mankind, Pramoedya portrayed the unjust life of the Indonesian people during the Dutch colonization period when social status was governed by the amount of European blood running through their veins. Pramoedya characterized Minke as an outspoken person, who refuses this hierarchical society by becoming a writer instead of a speech-maker, which bears a resemblance to Pramoedya's life who was jailed for two years after carrying anti-Dutch documents and then became a writer.

Although the peninsula of Gibraltar is only 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) long and 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) wide, it occupies an extremely strategic location on the southern Iberian coast at the western entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. Its position just across the eponymous Strait from Morocco in North Africa, as well as its natural defensibility, have made it one of the most fought-over places in Europe. Only five of the sieges resulted in a change of rule. Seven were fought between Muslims and Catholics during Muslim rule, four between Spain and Britain from the Anglo-Dutch capture in 1704 to the end of the Great Siege in 1783, two between rival Catholic factions, and one between rival Muslim powers. Four of Gibraltar's changes in rule, including three sieges, took place over a matter of days or hours, whereas several other sieges had durations of months or years and claimed the lives of thousands without resulting in any change in rule. <human>: Briefly describe List of sieges of Gibraltar. <bot>: There have been fourteen recorded sieges of Gibraltar. <human>: What happened in the 14th century? <bot>: List of sieges of Gibraltar There have been fourteen recorded sieges of Gibraltar. <human>: Why were they fighting? <bot>: Although the peninsula of Gibraltar is only long and wide, it occupies an extremely strategic location on the southern Iberian coast at the western entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. <human>: and? <bot>: Its position just across the eponymous Strait from Morocco in North Africa, as well as its natural defensibility, have made it one of the most fought-over places in Europe. <human>: Did they win? <bot>: Only five of the sieges resulted in a change of rule. <human>: What happened with the other sieges? <bot>: Seven were fought between Muslims and Catholics during Muslim rule, four between Spain and Britain from the Anglo-Dutch capture in 1704 to the end of the Great Siege in 1783, two between rival Catholic factions, and one between rival Muslim powers. <human>: Is there anything else you can share about the article? <bot>: Four of Gibraltar's changes in rule, including three sieges, took place over a matter of days or hours, whereas several other sieges had durations of months or years and claimed the lives of thousands without resulting in any change in rule.\n\n{ \"source\": \"infil_dbpedia\" }\n\nBackground: Photo CD is a system designed by Kodak for digitizing and saving photos onto a CD.
