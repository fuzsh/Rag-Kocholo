ATGTICKETS.COM/Birmingham\n\nP:03\n\nTheWelcome Ato lexandra We may be heading into the thick of autumn with thoughts very much turning towards Christmas, but the jam-packed season of shows rolls on at The Alexandra with this eagerly awaited performance. Weâve enjoyed magnificent support from our dedicated customers in this busy second half of the year and itâs my great pleasure to welcome you here today on behalf of everyone at the theatre. Looking ahead, this Christmas we are thrilled to host the internationally acclaimed stage sensation Jersey Boys, which begins a four-week run on Tuesday 7 December. This Broadway smash-hit musical has won 65 major awards and been seen by more than 27 million people worldwide, so itâs amazing to have the show in Birmingham for the festive period. Moving into the New Year there will be no January blues, as the spectacular musical Bat Out Of Hell thunders into town, bringing to life the legendary anthems of Jim Steinman and Meat Loaf. Before the month is out, two further brilliant musicals arrive at The Alexandra as we welcome The Addams Family and Chicago to the Second City. Joanne Clifton (Strictly Come Dancing, The Rocky Horror Show) will star as Morticia when the weird and wonderful world of the Addams clan delights audiences and then a week later a star-studded cast including Coronation Streetâs Faye Brookes and West End and TV star Darren Day will bring the razzle-dazzle of the 1920s to life in Chicago. If youâve got a theatre-lover in your family and youâre looking for that special Christmas gift, then look no further than a TheatreCard membership packed with benefits. Visit atgtickets.com/membership to discover more and treat your loved ones to a fantastic show in 2022. After a challenging year, we can all take comfort in the fact that brilliant shows are back on our stage and thank you once again for your continued support. Enjoy the performance!
