        "text": "The infusion of pure energy and the sound that wonât leave your mind and body indifferent in any moment â is Kal Band.\n\nThe eclectic rhythm created by the combination of Western Balkan music with swing, jazz, blues, and pop brings a completely new and original sound that is applied from the first to the last chords.\n\nThe group was founded in 1996. Since then, over a thousand concerts have been played abroad. They participated in all major European festivals: Fusion Festival â Germany, Pepsi Sziget Festival â Hungary, Berlinale Festival â Germany, EXIT Festival â Serbia, Belgrade Beer Fest â Serbia, Kustendorf Film and Music Festival â Serbia, Nisville Jazz Festival â Serbiaâ¦\n\nThose are the pure aesthetics of the minor scale, so itâs no surprise that western, music critics, the style that the Roma group put into our lives called RockâNâRoma, or Gypsy Rockabilly.\n\nThey played in America in 2006 and 2008. As a part of the tour, they guested at all major American clubs such as Joeâs Pub in New York city. There, musicians such as Leonard Cohen, David Byrne, Richard Thompson, Dolly Parton, Sinead OâConnor, Norah Jones, Youssou NâDour, David Gilmour and many more have been featured.\n\nOn the second US tour in 2008, they performed 45 concerts and collaborated with one of the most famous New York musical attractions, Gogol Bordello.\n\nÂ 2007 â First place on the annual chart of the World Chart Music Chart of Europe in 2007\n\nâ Davorin Popovic Award for Best Video in the Former Yugoslavia 2007\n\n2009 â Second place on the annual chart of the World Chart Music Chart of Europe in 2009\n\nâ Top 20 World Music CDs of the Year for band KAL."
