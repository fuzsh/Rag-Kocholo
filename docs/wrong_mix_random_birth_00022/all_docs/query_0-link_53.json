Of course, as is well known, the development of the general idea exemplified in the privilege of self-policing has long been what many Tennessee Valley Authority is being seriously con- trade groups have wanted and urgently demanded. sidered in Administration circles. How authentic We think, however, what they have had in mind is these reports are we do not know, but they appear very different from what they are likely to obtain Volume 139 Financial Chronicle under arrangements now in contemplation. In any event we cannot eliminate the belief from our own minds that it would be a very doubtful expedient to give industry and trade carte blanche to restrain competition in whatever degree it seemed best to them—and feasible for them. This latter may or may not be the true inwardness of current plans said to be in the process of formulation in Washington. Labor Provisions to Remain Most important of all in this connection, there is not the slightest indication of any intention on the part of the authorities in Washington to eliminate or even to relax the labor provisions of the codes. True, there are a few who have been able to build up some hope that the President will presently declare and demonstrate a newly found independence for organized labor, but certainly nothing has happened so far as we can learn to afford a solid basis for such a hope. Certainly the President's insistence upon a 36-hour week in the cotton clothing industry does not suggest any such independence. The same is obviously to be said of the conditions specified in the Executive Order directing the creation of a Cotton Textile Work Assignment Board. The conditions there set forth under which a manufacturer may be permitted to change the duties of his employees could hardly be matched outside of Russia. It is true That the President is apparently,for the moment at least, less inclined toward a universal 30-hour week than was the case some time ago, but it is by no means clear that pressure will not presently be exerted to have working hours shortened without corresponding reductions in weekly wage rates. It is not likely that a great deal of enthusiasm will be aroused in thoughtful minds by any change in the policies and practices of the National Recovery Administration which does nothing to lessen the burden of labor costs imposed by existing codes, costs that according to the Iron and Steel Institute amounted to some $95,000,000 in the steel industry during the first year under the code. Nor are official announcements from Washington indicating a purpose on the part of the authorities to stand by the Houde Engineering decision involving support of the principle of majority representation in labor matters apt to encourage the belief that there has been much change in the attitude of the Administration in its labor policy. Developments such as these, it is to be remembered, follow the Chicago address of Mr. Richberg and the price raising talk of the President with the press during the preceding week. It seems perfectly clear to us, therefore, that the business community would be wise to wait much more definite, concrete and convincing evidence before it places a great deal of faith in current reports of a \"turn to the right\" by the Administration. As already asserted, the Administration has evidently become impressed with the growth of hostility to much of the New Deal. It has without question been rendered uneasy by the development of extreme radicalism within its own party. The difficulty and the urgency of inducing genuine business recovery has doubtless given it pause. All this is heartening, but whether it will cause the authorities to do more than issue soothing statements and perhaps to take somewhat more effective steps than heretofore to curb the wilder elements in public life, is still in our opinion distinctly an open question. 2407 The Federal Reserve Bank Statement LTHOUGH some fairly important monetary transactions affecting Treasury indebtedness were carried out early this week, there is little evidence of this in the condition statement of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, combined, for the week to Wednesday night. In preparation for repayment of called Fourth Liberty 4%7 0 bonds that were not exchanged for other securities, the Treasury called for large amounts from the war loan deposits with member institutions. Apparently there was a close correspondence between the Treasury calls and the amounts of the bonds tendered for cash on Oct. 15, for excess reserves of member banks with the Federal Reserve System continued to increase while Treasury deposits with the System on general account hardly varied in the statistics for Oct. 17 as against figures for Oct. 10. In other respects, also, the Federal Reserve statement fails to reflect any important alterations in money and credit conditions. The Treasury deposited with the System a further $4,746,000 of gold certificates, which apparently corresponds to the fresh gold acquisitions for the weekly period. Of some interest is the steady advance in the industrial loans which now are a regular feature of the statement. Such loans by the Federal Reserve banks have increased to $4,576,000 on Oct. 17 from $3,708,000 on Oct. 10, while commitments to make such advances increased in the same period to $2,182,000 from $1,809,000. The deposits or sales of gold certificates by the Treasury to the Reserve institutions increased such holdings of the banks to $4,965,342,000 on Oct. 17 from $4,960,596,000 on Oct. 10, and as other cash also showed a gain the total reserves of the System increased to $5,203,164,000 from $5,186,387,000. Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation declined slightly to $3,182,329,000 from $3,184,558,000, while the net circulation of Federal Reserve bank notes receded to $29,425,000 from $29,664,000. Member bank deposits on reserve account were $3,996,276,000 on Oct. 17 against $3,978,521,000 on Oct. 10, indicating that excess reserves are approximately $1,800,000,000. Treasury deposits on general account were not much changed at $53,194,000, and foreign bank and other deposits also were stable, so that total deposits advanced about $20,000,000 to $4,232,888,000. The increase in gold certificates, together with the small decline in circulation, more than offset the advance of deposit liabilities, so that the ratio of total reserves to deposit and Federal Reserve note liabilities combined advanced to 70.2% from 70.1%. Discounts by the System decreased a little to $11,712,000. Bankers' bills bought in the open market were modestly higher at $6,177,000, while holdings of United States Government securities remained substantially unchanged at $2,430,265,000. A The New York Stock Market SERIES of dull sessions on the New York Stock Exchange occasioned few price changes of any significance in the current week. The market for equities was irregular, and the net result of the small upward and downward movements on alternate days was a very modest average recession in quotations. Turnover was somewhat in excess of 500,000 shares in each and every session, but on no occasion did transactions even approach the 1,000,000-share mark. The general trend Monday A 2408 Financial Chronicle was lower, with recessions measured in small fractions, and some groups moving in the opposite direction. It was indicated in Washington over the last week-end that inflationary moves are unlikely, and some liquidation of stocks followed. The tone Tuesday was firm, but changes again were quite small. On Wednesday and again on Thursday perceptible trends were lacking in the market as a whole. A moderate buying movement developed in merchandising stocks, and some preferred issues also were in demand. Movements yesterday were mostly toward lower levels, and in many instances large fractions to a point or more were lost. But the somberness of the market was again relieved by a few group movements, with merchandising shares quite prominent. The new margin requirements established under Securities and Exchange Commission control became effective this week, but they appeared to exercise no appreciable effect on trends. In the listed bond market conditions were very favorable early in the week, owing mainly to conclusion of the refunding of $1,250,000,000 Fourth / 4% bonds which were called last April Liberty 41 for redemption Oct. 15. The completion of such arrangements coincided with a resumption of investment activities by large institutions, and material gains developed in Treasury securities and high-grade corporate bonds. Later in the week it appeared that new financing would be resumed by one of the recovery corporations formed by the Fedeial Government, and the bond market turned hesitant while awaiting full information on the extent and nature of such financing. Foreign exchange markets were somewhat erratic, with sterling strong and weak by turns, and this induced the customary uncertainty regarding monetary developments. Commodity markets were irregular, but net changes for the week were small, and they were not of much influence in the stock and bond markets. Of more significance were the usual indices of industrial production, which remain less favorable than might be hoped. Steel-making operations for the week beginning Oct. 15 were estimated at 22.8% of capacity by the American Iron and Steel Institute, against 23.6% last week. Electric power production throughout the United States was 1,656,864,000 kilowatt hours in the week to Oct. 13, against 1,659,192,000 kilowatt hours in the preceding week, according to the Edison Electric Institute. The decrease was accounted for largely by the observance of Columbus Day in some parts of the country. Car loadings of revenue freight for the week to Oct. 13 were 635,639 cars, the American Railway Association indicates, this being a gain of 0.7% as compared with the preceding weekly period. As indicating the course of the commodity markets, the December option for wheat in Chicago closed yesterday at 987 / 8c. as against 102c. the close on Thursday of last week. December corn at Chicago closed yesterday at 767 / 8c. as against 767 / 8c. the close on Thursday of last week. December oats at Chicago closed yesterday at 51%c. as against 521/ 8c. the close on Thursday of last week. The spot price for cotton here in New York closed yesterday at 12.50c. as against 12.65c. the close on Thursday of last week. The spot price for rubber yesterday was 14.00c. as against 14.43c. the close on Thursday of last week. Domestic copper closed yesterday at 9c., the same as on Thursday of last week. Oct. 20 1934 In London, the price of bar silver yesterday was 23 15/16 pence per ounce as against 24% pence per ounce on Thursday of last week, and spot silver in New York at 531/ 4c. as against 535 / 8c. on Thursday of last week. In the matter of the foreign exchanges, cable transfers on London closed yesterday at $4.95/ 1 4 as against $4.931/ 8 the close on Thursday of last week, while cable transfers on Paris closed yesterday at 6.63%c. as against 6.65%c. on Thursday of last week. On the New York Stock Exchange 31 stocks reached new high levels for the year, while 15 stocks touched new low levels. On the New York Curb Exchange 24 stocks touched new high levels, while 35 stocks touched new low levels. Call loans on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged at 1%. On the New York Stock Exchange the sales at the half-day session on Saturday last were 414,090 shares; on Monday they were 511,076 shares; on Tuesday, 677,730 shares; on Wednesday, 662,210 shares; on Thursday, 655,110 shares, and on Friday, 527,312 shares. On the New York Curb Exchange the sales last Saturday were 104,235 shares; on Monday,102,845 shares; on Tuesday, 120,925 shares; on Wednesday, 126,080 shares; on Thursday, 161,245 shares, and on Friday, 125,955 shares. Dulness and indecision marked the course of the stock market this week, with prices of equities for the most part following an irregular trend. General Electric closed yesterday at 181/ 4 against 18% on Thursday of last week; Consolidated Gas of N. Y. / 4 against 285 at 263 / 8; Columbia Gas & Elec. at 83 / 4 against 93 / 8; Public Service of N. J. at 311/ 4 against 4 against 32%; J. I.

The steel stocks declined to lower levels for the week.

Political developments on the Continent were observed with the greatest care in all markets. In London a fairly hopeful view was taken and it was believed adjustments could be made without occasioning profound diplomatic difficulties. On the London Stock Exchange, accordingly, price trends were mildly irregular, with changes small. On the Paris Bourse the sharp recessions of the preceding week were continued and accentuated by the various adjustments found necessary in the Cabinet. Quotations on the Berlin Boerse also sagged, although Germany does not appear to be involved in the current developments relating to the murder of the Yugoslavian monarch. International monetary affairs were not considered in a very happy state and some of the liquidation on European markets was attributed to growing nervousness over the sharp fluctuations of sterling exchange and the uncertainty surrounding the gold bloc conference at Brussels. Reports of trade and industrial trends in Europe remain somewhat mixed. Some British industries are less active than in recent months, but the motor industry seems to be enjoying a small boom. British foreign trade returns for September were quite favorable. Industrial production in Germany is reported as declining. Wholesale price indices in England and Germany have declined recently, but the French index has again advanced. The London Stock Exchange was quiet and modestly irregular in the initial session of the current week. British funds were marked lower by small fractions, but good demand was encountered for Indian bonds. Home railway issues were firm and some good features developed among the industrial stocks, while others were soft. In the international section changes were small and in both directions. In another dull session on Tuesday, British funds improved slightly. Some of the industrial issues were subjected to liquidation, but others remained steady. In the international group a general downward tendency developed, chiefly because of unfavorable overnight reports from New York. Trends again were mixed on Wednesday, with dealings still on a very small scale. British funds were uncertain, but home railway shares improved on good traffic returns. Industrial issues were marked S 2409 Financial Chronicle lower with only a few exceptions. Anglo-American trading favorites were better in the international section, but foreign bonds eased. There was a better demand on Thursday for British funds, but other sections of the London market remained irregular. African gold mining issues improved sharply because of an increase in the price of the metal. Leading industrial 'stocks were marked slightly lower, while international securities were firm. The upswing in British funds continued yesterday, but other sections of the market are uncertain. Prices on the Paris Bourse were heavy as trading was resumed on Monday, with buying orders lacking because of the domestic and international political difficulties. Rentes lost ground notwithstanding indications that a French internal loan was better received than had been anticipated. French stocks and international issues also were marked downward and the losses were quite extensive in some departments. The decline was continued and accentuated Tuesday, largely as a consequence of alarmist rumors regarding the Balkan situation. Rentes were slightly lower, but Yugoslavian securities fell sharply. Only a little activity was reported in French bank, utility and industrial stocks, which also lost ground. The opening Wednesday was firm, owing to formal announcement that the Treasury's internal loan had been materially oversubscribed. As the session progressed, however, declines again set in and initial gains were not maintained even in rentes. French utility stocks were especially soft in the later dealings, but others also declined. The Bourse was closed Thursday because of the funeral of Bing Alexander of Yugoslavia. Rentes again receded as trading was Tesumed yesterday, while other securities also dropped. The Berlin Boerse was extremely dull Monday and the general trend was downward, owing to the universal uncertainty regarding the political developments in Europe. Changes were mostly fractional and were due in the main to modest liquidation by professional traders. A few stocks in the mining group showed strength. Tuesday's dealings were again on a very modest scale, with stocks weak while fixed-interest securities advanced. Losses in equities were mostly small, but in some instances they amounted to 3 and 4 points. Dullness remained the prevailing characteristic on Wednesday and most price changes were toward lower levels. Potash stocks were among the issues in demand, while some further inquiry for bonds also was noted. A new law was promulgated Thursday providing for taxation of speculative profits in equities, although similar profits on bonds are not to be subjected to the levy. Renewed liquidation of stocks was noted in consequence and prices of such securities were marked downward, but bonds were in fair demand. In quiet dealings yesterday stocks were irregular, but bonds were marked higher. The Silver Imbroglio IT IS becoming ever more apparent that the American silver monetization program, far from providing the aid for trade with China predicted by its proponents, will prove a detriment to commercial intercourse with the Far East and may even affect diplomatic relations between the United States and China. Communications exchanged between Nanking and Washington on the silver question were made public without comment last Sunday and 2410 Financial Chronicle Tuesday, the formal notes being made available first while informal communications were disclosed later. They evince a keen anxiety on the part of the Chinese Government to prevent the sharp advance in the price of silver noted on world markets in consequence of the American buying. In reply, Secretary of State Cordell Hull politely pointed out that the buying program would be continued by the United States Government, although efforts would be made to avoid disturbances to the Chinese economy. The Chinese Government announced last Sunday, in this situation, the protective step of a 10% export tax on silver, and it was indicated at the same time that extensive advances in the price of the metal would be followed by renewed endeavors to halt the drain of money from the country. There was also a suggestion on the part of China for a direct exchange of silver for gold, but this was not viewed with favor in the American reply. In a preliminary exchange of communications, China posed the question whether the silver purchases by the United States were in conformity with the spirit of the international silver agreement signed at London in 1933. That agreement was designed primarily to assure the stability of the price of silver, it was pointed out. Information was requested as to the probable policy of the United States in further purchases of silver, so that steps could be taken by China for safeguarding her currency,\"which is flowing out of the country to a degree that is potentially alarming.\" It was pointed out by the United States Government, in reply, that an excessively high price for silver is not desired or contemplated. The Silver Purchase Act provisions calling for the accumulation of the metal until a ratio of one-fourth silver to three-fourths gold is attained were quoted and assurances were given that the greatest care would be exercised in carrying out these provisions. China, in an informal rejoinder, contended that the rising price of silver has involved severe deflation and economic losses to China and has dislocated that country's balance of international payments. Chinese silver exports so far this year are more than three times those of any previous full year, and continuation of such tendencies might cause serious injury and possibly panic conditions, it was added. Assurances were asked that the United States will refrain from any action that might cause continued exports of silver from China, and it was reiterated that the London agreement contemplated stability. From China's viewpoint, the stabilized price should be somewhat lower than the present levels. The communication remarked that China is contemplating the gradual introduction of a gold base currency and the query was put, \"in principle,\" whether the American Government is willing to exchange with the Chinese Government gold for silver. In the formal notes exchanged thereafter by the two Governments, little was added to the statements and declarations of the preliminary communications. Dr. H. H. Kung, the Chinese Finance Minister, remarked in a note of Oct. 2 that American cooperation to prevent a further rise in the price of silver and to maintain stability as contemplated in the London agreement is particularly vital to China. \"In this connection it may be pointed out that the rise of silver discourages the export of commodities and thereby impairs China's purchasing power for imports,\" the Chinese note said. \"Also a reply is Oct. 20 1934 desired to our inquiry regarding the exchange of silver for gold.\" Expressing a desire to avoid export restrictions, China asked the American Government to confine its silver purchases for the present to silver already in the United States. Secretary Hull replied on Oct. 12 that the silver purchases are mandatory under the American legislation, although ways and means of carrying out the objective are within the discretion of the President. \"This Government,\" the American note stated,\"is desirous of so carrying out the program as to produce the general benefit that would result from the enhancement and stabilization of the price of silver, and to avoid so far as possible disturbances to the economy and public finances of China.\" Mr. Hull indicated that close consideration would be given the Chinese contentions in further arrangements for purchases of silver. Direct intergovernmental transactions, such as China suggested, have not been undertaken, it was added, but readiness was expressed to explore at any time such larger problems. After a series of protracted conferences at Nanking, the Chinese Government announced last Sunday that a customs duty had been imposed on silver exports, effective Oct. 15, in order to safeguard China's economic interests and protect her currency. On silver dollars and mint bars this export duty is 470 minting charge, or 7%7 1070, less the 21/ 0 net, while on other forms of silver the duty will be a flat 10%,as against the former 21/ 470 export duty. \"In addition,\" the announcement added, \"an equalization charge will be imposed upon exports of silver equal to the deficiency, if any exists, between the theoretical parity of London silver and the rate of exchange officially fixed by the Central Bank of China after making allowance for the export duty.\" Finance Minister Kung issued a statement at the same time in which he pointed out that there is no reason to expect a cessation of American purchases. Although an embargo on silver exports was suggested by many of the leaders of business and finance consulted, this alternative was not adopted by the Chinese Government, which prefers a flexible duty \"that will restrain the exports of silver within limits actually required by the balance of payments.\" The Administration in Washington appears to take a light view of the Chinese tax, as Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., was quoted in an Associated Press dispatch, Monday, as saying the tax would have little effect upon the Treasury's huge silver buying program. German Trade and Finance HAT the commercial and financial relationships between the United States and Germany are becoming ever more involved and increasingly less satisfactory to American traders and investors is hardly more than a commonplace nowadays. The German Government took two steps in the last ten days which may aid its desire for autarchy, or economic self-sufficiency, but which assuredly will not contribute to its good repute. The existing trade treaty between the two countries was denounced on Oct. 13, and two days later the German Government defaulted formally on interest payments due in foreign currencies on its own external obligations. To American business men the former step is, perhaps, of no great immediate significance, since the foreign exchange restrictions of German authorities already had curtailed ordinary transactions and re- T Volume 139 Financial Chronicle duced them sharply. The treaty, moreover, does not lapse formally until Oct. 14 1935, and in the meanwhile another commercial treaty may well be negotiated. The investment community, however, was loath to believe until the last minute that the sovereign German Government would refuse to abide by its contractual obligations, especially when avoidance of default would have entailed a relatively minor drain on Germany's foreign exchange resources. Dr. Hans Luther, the German Ambassador, informed the State Department on Oct. 13 that the Berlin Government desired to bring about changes in Article 7 of the existing commercial treaty. That article provides for most-favored-nation treatment. The German Government's intention was \"not necessarily\" to terminate the treaty, according to Washington dispatches, but a restatement of the article was held necessary by Germany because of the development of German trade along bi-lateral channels. At the State Department the German notification was accepted as a formal notice of termination of the agreement, since the treaty provides for such termination if either party notifies the other of an intention of modifying, by change or omission, any of the provisions or any of the articles of the treaty. In Washington reports it was noted that the State Department gave a cool reception to Dr. Luther's suggestion for negotiations looking toward replacement of the pact. It was remarked briefly that American officials are not ready at present to negotiate. The German Government's default occurred Monday, when the authorities in Berlin failed to supply the funds necessary for meeting the payment in foreign currency on American holdings of the Dawes loan of 1924. Before the German moratorium was declared last June, three monthly payments out of the six necessary to meet the coupon due Oct. 15 were transferred, and half the required sum thus was available and was paid by the three trustees of the loan. Against the remaining 50% of interest due, the German authorities made registered Reichsmarks available, but such registered marks are a highly restricted form of German exchange and they are quoted in the foreign exchange markets at approximately half their nominal value. In effect, therefore, American holders of Dawes 7's received an aggregate of about 75% of the sums due them contractually, Oct. 15. Because of special arrangements made with Germany by the British, French, Netherlands and other Governments, holders of the tranches of the Dawes loan floated in other countries than the United States received full payments of Oct. 15 coupons in their own currencies. It seems quite evident, therefore, that discrimination was exercised by Germany against American bondholders, even though the German Government is said to have given assurances to Washington that such discrimination would not take place. Officials of the Administration at Washington are studying this phase of the matter. Of the original $110,000,000 American tranche of the Dawes loan approximately $60,000,000 remain outstanding. The sum due American holders on Oct. 15 was somewhat more than $2,000,000, of which half already had been transferred prior to the moratorium, so that transfer of only a little more than $1,000,000 would have sufficed to prevent the formal default at this time. 2411 Naval Disarmament RELIMINARY discussions of naval armaments P problems have been resumed at London by representatives of the United States, British and Japanese Governments, with a view to ascertaining whether there is any prospect for success in formal negotiations next year. It will probably be determined in the course of the current informal exchanges whether the 1935 naval conference will be held at all, and it may also be that Japanese or British denunciations of the existing Washington and London naval treaties will depend upon the outcome. Norman H. Davis and Admiral William H. Standley, as the chief American representatives, arrived in London on Tuesday, and some of the Japanese technical experts appeared on the same day. The Japanese Ambassador to London, Tsuneo Matsudaira, heads the delegation from Tokio. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, of Great Britain, is expected to play an important part in the gatherings, which will probably be of a bilateral nature, although round-table conferences of all three delegations also are possible. The positions of all three countries are now fairly well known, and as they diverge at important points, no great confidence is felt regarding the success of the current discussions. The United States desires continuation of the Washington and London treaties, and possibly a material reduction of some type§ of warships. Britain has indicated a desire for additional vessels of the small fast cruiser types that are especially suitable for a world Power with naval bases throughout the oceans. Japan has made no secret of her desire to end the 60%. ratio of British or American fleets of larger vessels and insists upon a global arrangement of types and tonnages. Since the known views are so widely at variance, it is reported that many experienced British diplomats heartily wish a way could be found for shelving the entire issue at this time. The difficulties, moreover, are not confined to the three leading naval powers since competitive French and Italian building threatens to upset the traditional British standard of a fleet equal to any two Continental navies. In the background looms the German rearmament program, which some experts believe soon will be extended to the naval sphere. Practical diplomacy clearly dictates a delay in the discussions, since naval armaments problems are almost as numerous and complicated as those which forced delay on land disarmament discussions, but the impending expiration of the most important naval treaties does not permit of the postponement expedients employed so liberally by the General Disarmament Conference in a vain attempt to disguise the abject failure of land disarmament negotiations. Balkan Affairs HERE were many evidences of intense diplomatic activity in Europe this week, as the statesmen of almost all Continental countries grappled with the changes wrought in the Balkans by the assassination of the Yugoslavian King, Alexander. Within the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes some signs of dissension appeared even while the King was being laid to rest. The Croatians prepared to demand a larger share in the Government at Belgrade, and some reports suggest that autonomist ambitions were voiced. But the internal affairs of T 2412 Yugoslavia were overshadowed, for the time being at least, by continued apprehensions of international complications resulting from the assassination of the King and Foreign Minister Louis Barthou of France. Several accomplices of the assassin were arrested this week, and it appears that a Croatian terrorist band with headquarters in Hungary was responsible for the murders. The revelations occasioned much feeling in Yugoslavia against Hungary, and in some cities riots against Italy also were repeated because of rumors that Italian machinations were in some way connected with the incidents. Leading statesmen of the French, Czechoslovakian and Rumanian Governments met in Paris early this week to consider the situation and endeavor to prevent Yugoslavian indignation from taking an accusatory form directed against any nation. Dr. Edouard Benes, the Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister, was delegated to exert his great influence toward that end and he promptly left Paris for Belgrade. In the Yugoslavian capital a meeting of Little Entente Ministers was held to consider whether an appeal should be made to the League of Nations to sift the circumstances surrounding the assassination of King Alexander. In Geneva, however, every effort was made to avoid any such appeal to the League, for that body is admittedly in no condition to handle \"political dynamite.\" The Italian Government took a sensible view of the riots in some Yugoslavian cities and there was no corresponding excitement within Italy. Numberless rumors were current regarding the possible effects of the occurrence on Yugoslavian politics, on the Little Entente and even on the general European situation. Among the few definite developments was a decision to postpone, indefinitely, the Balkan conference which was scheduled to take place this month. King Alexander was buried near Belgrade, Thursday, with appropriate rituals, with the President of France, the Kings of Bulgaria and Rumania and many other dignitaries present. Peter, the 11-year old son of Alexander, was proclaimed the new monarch of Yugoslavia late last week, and the regency assumed formal control. French Cabinet REMIER GASTON DOUMERGUE of France, who has met many political crises since he came into office last February, successfully surmounted another difficulty this week, when several members of his National Union Cabinet resigned in response to the general indignation over the assassinations at Marseilles of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and Foreign Minister Louie Barthou. The first task facing the Premier was that of naming a successor to the murdered Foreign Minister. Pierre Laval, who held the post of Minister of Colonies in the Cabinet, was assigned to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and the vacancy thus created was filled by the appointment of Louis Rollin as Minister of Colonies. Albert Sarraut, as Minister of the Interior, was the center of the political storm roused by the assassinations, as it was charged that he had not taken sufficient precautions for the protection of the King. He presented his resignation to 111. Doumergue last week, and Paul Marchandeau was named his successor. Because of the growing dissatisfaction in France over the conduct of the Stavisky scandal hearings, Minister of Justice Henri P Oct. 20 1934 Financial Chronicle Cheron was forced to tender his resignation, and the filling of this post caused some difficulty. After it was tendered unsuccessfully to several eminent Frenchmen, Senator Henri Lemery accepted the office, and the National Union Cabinet was again complete. It remains evident, however, that the regime will be subjected to severe attacks when the Parliament reassembles. M. Laval, who has headed the Foreign Ministry before, is expected to continue the strongly nationalistic policies of M. Barthou. Hitler and the German Church IN MANY a long year there has been no such interesting development among German churchmen as their current resistance to Nazi domination of the Evangelical Church in the Reich, and it is perhaps even more significant that Chancellor-President Adolf Hitler and his Nazi followers appear reluctant to take any measures against the churchmen. Several Bishops of the Protestant Church were expelled recently by the Nazi Reich Bishop, Ludwig Mueller, obviously for political reasons. But in Munich some 16,000 Bavarian pastors pathered last Sunday and expressed their distaste of Nazi churchmen and Nazi political interference in no uncertain terms. The Associated Press reports that large numbers of the churchmen proceeded to the Brown House in Munich, which is the headquarters of the Nazi movement,and spat on the ground while shouting derisively at Chancellor Hitler. In pulpits all over Germany the attempt at Nazi domination of the 'Church was denounced last Sunday, and a manifesto was circulated in which Nazi Bishops were taken to task for \"the triumph of violence and hypocrisy.\" This is the first time since Hitler came into power that any such organized outburst against his regime has been permitted, and the occurrence has been interpreted everywhere as an indication that the Nazi regime is far from enjoying the general acclaim suggested by Nazi propaganda and the results of the peculiar plebiscite held earlier this year.

The pound is also fractionally firmer in terms of the French franc. Speculative drives against sterling seem to have subsided and at present the only pressure against the pound is the normal seasonal influence caused by the heavy imports by Great Britain of foodstuffs and raw materials from the primary producing countries. The range for sterling this week has been between 5 for bankers' sight bills, compared 3 and $4.95% $4.90/ with range of between $4.89 and $4.933 last week. The range for cable transfers has been between 4, compared with a range of $4.903/ and $4.953 between $4.893/ and $4.93% a week earlier.

There is less talk in London of the possibility of stabilization of the pound with relation to the dollar. It is felt there that American policies are still too undefined to make the Oct. 20 1934 approach of sterling to the dollar practicable. London bankers and financial authorities on the Continent also seem to feel that there will be extensive changes in the banking and monetary set-up in the United States. London is quite convinced that for the present at least there will be no further devaluation of the dollar. They see in the United States Treasury plans for refinancing in April the entire probability that no change can be made in dollar valuation, if one is to be made at all, until some time after April. In any event it would seem more likely that Great Britain will shape its monetary policy in the direction of accord with the European gold bloc policies rather than overstress the relation of sterling to the dollar. Delegates of the gold bloc countries have now gathered in Brussels for their second \"defense conference.\" On the eve of the conference, Paris dispatches stated that Great Britain would be invited to give adherence to whatever agreements might be reached by the 35 delegates representing the seven gold bloc nations. It is even thought possible by some Paris authorities that as a result of the conference Great Britain might be induced to return to the gold standard. It is pointed out that it would be only reasonable to expect that the London authorities would wish to work in harmony with these countriesFrance, Belgium, Holland, Luxemburg, Italy, Switzerland and Poland-as they represent in Europe a combined population of more than 100,000,000 in an unbroken extent of territory stretching from the Adriatic to the North Sea and taking in all of western Europe, except the Iberian Peninsula. Omitting Russia, they represent 36% of the population and 37% of the international trade carried on Sin Europe. Several of the gold bloc countries have extensive colonial empires, the population and commerce of which must also be taken into consideration in estimating the power of the gold bloc. However, recent statements in high quarters in Great Britain give no encouragement to the idea of an early return to the gold standard by Great Britain. Nevertheless, it is well to bear in mind that when England does return to gold it is very likely to do so without consultation with other nations. At present Great Britain is enjoying a high degree of business activity. Profits of British industries have risen sharply and it would seem are on average 27% higher than for the third quarter of 1933. In some lines profits have doubled. In the quarter just ended 318 companies reported total profits of £17,100,000, compared with £13,400,000 for the same firms a year ago. This is an impressive proof of Great Britain's trade recovery. Twenty-eight iron, coal and steel companies show increase in net profits amounting to 120.5%. Two motorcycle and aviation concerns report a gain of 112.4%. The nation-wide building boom is reflected in reports of 10 companies making building materials whose profits were 87.8% over those of last year. Sixty-four rubber companies reported profits of 72.9% higher than in 1933. Returns of the London clearing banks show an increase of 10.2% for the period Jan. 1 to Oct. 3, compared with the corresponding period last year. Total clearings for the period amount to L26,501,185,000, compared with £24,051,493,000 in the like period a year ago, an increase of 0,449,692,000. Less shipping is laid up in Great Britain and Ireland than at any time since 1930. According to the London \"Economist,\" this is the first time in seven years that the third quarter of Volume 139 Financial Chronicle the year has shown such general improvement. An upward trend in profits is now said to be general throughout British industry. Money continues in great abundance in London and open market rates remain practically unchanged. Call money against bills is in abundance at 1A% to 4 3 %. Two-months' bills are at 11-16% to 23-32%, three-months' bills are 25-32% to 13-16%, fourmonths' bills 13-16% to %%,and six-months' bills 15-16% to 1%. The London gold price continues high, although it shows considerable recession from the high record of 143s. 3d. per ounce reported on Thursday, Oct. 11. The gold price continues to be based more or less dolly on the franc-sterling rate of exchange, although an increase in demand has raised the premium over the French parity price which buyers are willing to pay to about 10 pence per ounce. The premium is included in the price quoted daily in the market. All the gold available from day to day continues to be taken for unknown destinations, believed to be for account of private owners. These takings are generally left on deposit in the vaults of the large London banks, though some of it doubtless finds its way to central banks in Europe. On Friday last there was available £180,000, on Saturday £211,000, on Monday £203,000, on Tuesday £521,000, on Wednesday £585,000, on Thursday £587,000, and on Friday £134,000. On Friday the Bank of England bought 02,641 in gold bars. The Bank of England statement for the week ended Oct. 17 shows a loss in gold holdings of 0,828. Total gold holdings now stand at £192,584,337, which compares with £191,731,964 a year ago and with the minimum of £150,000,000 recommended by the Cunliffe committee. At the Port of New York the gold movement for the week ended Oct. 17, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consisted of imports of $859,000, of which $838,000 came from Canada and $21,000 from Guatemala. There were no gold exports. The Reserve Bank reported an increase of $21,000 in gold earmarked for foreign account. In tabular form the gold movement at the Port of New York for the week ended Oct. 17, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was as follows: GOLD MOVEMENT AT NEW YORK, OCT. 11—OCT. 17,INCL.

Cotton and grain for payment closed at $4.95. Continental and Other Foreign Exchange XCHANGE on the Continental countries continues relatively easy without much change from last week. Interest centers in the gold bloc conference, which begins to-day in Brussels. The conference has been touched upon above in the resume of sterling exchange. Reports are rife as to the probable scope. and measures which inay be adopted as a result of this conference, but nothing can be known definitely until the outcome of its discussions is officially announced. It can be positively asserted only that the participating nations are strongly committed to the maintenance of the gold standard. An agr\" eement to this effect was signed in London on July 3 1933, and the September Geneva communique which came from the first or preliminary gold bloc conference asserted: \"The powers on the gold standard are more than ever determined, as stated in their declaration signed in London on July 3 1933, to maintain it integrally at the present gold parity, this appearing to them as one of the essential conditions for the economic and financial restoration of the world.\" According to reports from Amsterdam suggestions have been made in influential quarters that the gold bloc pool the economic resources of the colonial empires for the purpose of insuring a measure of independence with regard to essential raw materials. Belgium is the weakest link in the gold bloc. The belga has been under pressure for some time and the unit has been ruling easy in terms of the dollar, French franc, sterling and most other currencies. The belga has been in constant need of defense for a considerable period. Latest dispatches from Brussels state that the cabinet has approved drastic reductions in Belgian Government expenses, assuring a balanced budget. French francs are largely unchanged from last week and are ruling easier in terms of both the dollar and sterling. The franc is also easy in terms of guilders and Swiss francs. During the past week market reports indicated that there has been some flow of French and Continental funds to London. Owing to shipments of gold from Paris to Amsterdam and Zurich, the gold flow to Paris from hoarded resources in London and on the Continent has been greatly curtailed in recent weeks. The British Exchange Equalization Fund seems also to have disposed of much less gold to Paris. Nevertheless the Bank of France statement for the week ended Oct. 12 shows a further increase in gold holdings of 60,000,000 francs. This makes the 32nd weekly increase, bringing the total for the period to 8,478,_ E Financial Chronicle 2416 743,243 francs. Total gold holdings now stand at 82,406,000,000 francs, which compares with 82,483,264,000 francs a year ago and with 28,935,000,000 francs when the unit was stabilized in June 1928. The Bank's ratio is at the high figure of 80.67%, which compares with 79.64% a year ago and with legal requirement of 35%. There are no new developments of importance in mark exchange. The German exchange situation The high continues extremely unsatisfactory. quotations for marks in terms of the dollar are deceptive, representing as they do a scarcity value due to the limited amount of foreign exchange which the German exchange control will grant the market. , The following table shows the relation of the leading European currencies still on gold to the United States dollar: France (franc) Belgium (belga) Italy (lira) Germany (mark) Switzerland (franc) Holland (guiltier) Old Dollar New Dollar Parity Parity 6.63 3.92 23.54 13.90 8.91 5.26 23.82 40.33 19.30 32.67 40.20 68 06 Range This Week 6634 to 6.66% 23.50 to 23.61 8.62 to 8.66 40.48 to 40.72 32.811i to 32.99 68.18 to 68.54 The London check rate on Paris closed on Friday at 74.60 against 74.02 on Thursday of last week. In New York sight bills on the French center finished on Friday at 6.6314,against 6.655A on Thursday of last week; cable transfers at 6.63 8, against 6.65% and commercial sight bills at 6.613 %, against 6.63%.

The range of fluctuation of the leading neutral currencies is not materially changed. The matter of greatest importance to the neutral exchanges is the gold bloc conference which meets in Brussels to-day, as noted above in the remarks on sterling exchange and on the Continental units. The gold reserves of the Bank of the Netherlands increased by 5,400,000 guilders last week to 877,700,000 guilders. Note cover is now 80%. Bankers' sight on Amsterdam finished on Friday at 68.17, against 68.48 on Thursday of last week; cable transfers at 68.18, against 68.49 and commercial sight bills at 68.15, against 68.45.

Checks on Sweden closed at 25.53 and cable transfers at 25.54, against 25.46 and 25.47, while checks on Norway finished at 24.88 and cable transfers at 24.89, against 24.79 and 24.80. Spanish pesetas closed at 13.74 for bankers'sight bills and at 13.75 for cable transfers, against 13.81 and 13.82. E Oct. 20 1934 XCHANGE on the South American countries is strongly inclined to follow the swings in sterling. The market for the South American currencies is somewhat limited in New York. but is more active than it has been for several years. On the whole the South American countries are experiencing a period of considerable prosperity. In the first seven months of this year Argentina increased her exports to 834,392,000 pesos from 685,519,000 pesos in the corresponding period last year. Imports also rose to 598,590,000 pesos from 504,582,000 pesos, but the export surplus gained, moving to 235,802,000 pesos from 180,937,000 pesos. Brazil also shows flourishing export business. For the first half of the year exports totaled 1,661,051,000 milreis, against 1,34p3,408,000 milreis in the first half of 1933. Imports increased to 1,137,700,000 milreis against 995,492,000 milreis in the first half of 1933. The Brazilian export surplus increased from 357,916,000 milreis to 523,375,000 milreis. Peru records similar favorable progress and Chile shows a remarkable gain in exports. Argentine paper pesos closed on Friday, official quotations, at 32% for bankers' sight bills, against 323/i on Thursday of last week; cable transfers at 33, against 33. The unofficial or free market close was 2634@26 , against 26%@26%. Brazilian milreis, official rates, are quoted 8Y1. for bankers' sight and 8% for cable transfers, against 834 and 8%. The unofficial or free market close was 7%, against 73 4Chilean exchange is nominally quoted 1034:, against 2. 103 / 8. Peru is nominal at 22.68, against 22.623/ E XCHANGE on the Far Eastern countries presents confusing aspects due partly to Chinese official measures to steady the internal value of their currency and prices, which are now menaced by the advance in world silver prices brought about by the silver purchase policy of the United States. The confusion in exchange is also intensified by the fact that the Japanese control has lowered the peg of the yen with respect to sterling. The Indian rupee fluctuates of course, in harmony with sterling, to which it is legally attached at the fixed rate of is. 6d. per rupee. China has made a proposal to exchange its silver for United States gold and has suggested that China May be compelled to abandon the silver standard and go on a gold basis. Recent reports from Shanghai indicate that the Central Bank of China is laying the groundwork for a stabilization fund to steady silver in its relation to China's internal price structure. On Sunday the Chinese Government imposed a tax of 10% on silver exports, whether in the form of bullion, sycee, or coin. Its law governing the matter is such that, if necessary to accomplish its purpose of arresting the outflow of silver from Shanghai, the tax may be increased at will as circumstances dictate. The inclusion of silver coin in the export duty is of vital importance. Heretofore China has had a tax of 23/2% plus a surcharge of 23/2% on the tax, on exports of sycee and bar silver. Exports of coin were exempt from the duty. It is believed that the American Government acting through banks in Shanghai and Tientsin acquired millions of ounces in the form of coin, though this cannot be stated with certainty at this juncture. At any rate stocks of Mexican dollars in Shanghai declined in number from 388,000,000 dollars on June 9 to 339,000,000 dollars on Sept. 22. Any rise in silver in London is expected to result automatically in an upward revision of the export E Financial Chronicle Volume 139 duty. It is felt that even the possibility of a further advance in the export duty will cause a cessation of Chinese offerings in London. These heavy offerings alone have prevented a runaway price in the London silver market in recent weeks. Between June 9 and Oct. 6 silver stocks at Shanghai suffered a net decline of 104,934,000 ounces to 344,915,000 ounces. The London offerings from China are believed to have been largely absorbed by the United States Government. Hong Kong dollars are only slightly affected by the Chinese Government rulings, as Hong Kong is a British crown colony. The action of the Chinese Government has the effect of practically removing Shanghai from the silver standard so far as the outside world is concerned. It is understood that one of the reasons that Japan lowered the peg on yen was to offset any trade advantage which China might gain through keeping down the value of its silver. Foreign exchange observers believe that the price of silver in Shanghai, and therefore the exchange value of the Shanghai dollar, will decline sufficiently to compensate for the export tax. Among other claims, China insists that the rising silver prices place her in an unfavorable competitive position with Japan. In order to protect her position Japan lowered the peg in the yen sterling market on Tuesday from the bid of 14 1-16d., where it had been for several days, to an offer of 14d. This change has not been reflected in a marked drop in yen exchange in New York because of the sharp rise in sterling. The export business and internal trade of both China and Japan is more active and prosperous than it has been for several years. The commercial Secretary of the Japanese Embassy reports that the loss in the export industry caused by the recent • typhoon and tidal wave was rather slight and normal production is already well under way.

The Vexed Question of Collective Bargaining A reading of the famous Section 7-A of the National Industrial Recovery Act does not at first suggest any difficulty of interpretation. The section calls for the insertion, in every code of fair competition, of the provisions \"that employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and shall be free from the interference, restraint or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\" and \"that no employee and no one seeking employment shall be required as a condition of employment to join any company union or to refrain from joining, organizing or assisting a labor organization of his own choosing.\" The provisions seem, at first sight, to mean nothing more nor less than that employees may, if they choose, act collectively rather than individually in any agreements they may make with their employers, that in so doing they shall not be interfered with or coerced by employers, and that no discrimination in employment shall be exercised because of membership in any labor organization. The Recovery Act became law on June 16 1933. Instead of promoting harmony between employers and their employees, however, the collective bargaining provisions became almost at once an active source of discord. The summer and fall of 1933 saw an epidemic of strikes in many of which collective bargaining was, or appeared to be, the primary issue. Early in July the extraordinary spectacle was presented of Sidney Hillman, at that time a member of the Federal Labor Advisory Board, authorizing a strike in the New York City area of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, of which organization he was president. In spite of the provision that employees might \"organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,\" organized labor officials demanded the abolition of company unions, and when in August President Roosevelt set up a National Labor Board under the chairmanship of Senator Wagner of New York,two of the memberships were given to William 2418 Financial Chronicle Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, and John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America. It is not apparent that the Administration intended at first to give exclusive recognition, in interpreting Section 7-A, to any one form of labor organization, but the fight which was opened on company unions caught it between two fires. The issue was sharply drawn at the end of July when the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce submitted an automobile code which, after reciting the labor provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act, added the reservation that \"in accordance with the foregoing provisions the employers in the automobile industry propose to continue the open shop policy heretofore followed,\" and that \"the selection, retention and advancement of employees will be on the basis of individual merit without regard to their affiliation or non-affiliation with any.labor or other organization.\" The reservation brought vigorous protests from William Green and Donald Richberg, the latter at that time counsel for the National Recovery Administration, and on Aug. 23 General Johnson and Mr. Richberg, in a joint statement, announced that \"the plain meaning\" of Section 7-A \"cannot be changed by any interpretation by any one,\" that \"the words 'open shop' and 'closed shop' are not used in the law and cannot be written into the law,\" that the collective bargaining provision \"can mean only one thing, which is that employees can choose any one they desire to represent them, or they can choose to represent themselves,\" and that \"employers may likewise make collective bargains with organized employees or individual agreements with those who choose to act individually.\" The automobile representatives, however, stoutly resisted Administration pressure, and although, in the code as finally approved, the reference to the open shop was dropped, the provision regarding the selection and retention of employees on the basis of individual merit, regardless of any organization affiliations, was retained. The automobile code was the conspicuous beginning of a controversy which has continued, with increased rather than lessened bitterness, until the present time. The section of organized labor represented by Mr. Green has not only fought every kind of union except its own, but has insisted that a minority of employees, however large, must be held to be represented by whatever representatives the majority may choose. The latter position has been sustained by the Federal Labor Relations Board, thereby giving to the contention an Administration endorsement. The controversy has served to cast doubt upon the meaning of collective bargaining as the term is used in the National Industrial Recovery Act, and to read into Section 7-A, as the view of organized labor, an interpretation which the plain language of the section certainly does not sustain. Instead of industrial harmony and cooperation for recovery, we have had nearly a year and a half of charges and counter-charges, recriminations and attacks, pulling and hauling, and one of the most disturbed and menacing labor situations that the country has ever known. The attempt which the General Motors Corporation has just made to clarify the situation in its own particular field is, accordingly, of wide significance. In a statement, signed by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., as president, which was mailed to the 130,000 em Oct. 20 1934 ployees of the corporation on Monday, the various aspects of collective bargaining are broadly dealt with. General Motors, the statement declares, recognizes collective bargaining as \"a constructive step forward, both for the employees and management,\" and the purpose is \"not only to continue the idea but to develop it.\" Collective bargaining is defined as \"a method of intercommunication and negotiation between employees and management, whose objective is the maintenance of harmonious and cooperative relations through mutual understanding and agreement with respect to terms and conditions of employment.\" \"Membership in a labor union,\" the statement continues, \"does not in itself establish the right of any such union or other organization to represent employees in collective bargaining negotiations,\" but the representatives for such purpose \"must have been specifically chosen by the employees they are to represent, and the fact of such choice must be established.\" This sets aside at once the claim of organized labor to exclusive recognition of a particular union or form of union in collective bargaining, and gives recognition to any group of employees, whether organized or not, provided the representatives are specifically chosen as such by the workers for whom they are to speak. It is not expected that, with collective bargaining established and conducted on these lines, complaints and controversies will cease to appear. The statement recognizes that \"controversial questions of fact, such as discrimination cases and questions of layoff, may frequently be more amicably and speedily settled through an impartial, competent, fact-finding agency having the confidence. of both sides,\" but the submission of such cases to outside bodies is to be made only with the specific authorization of the executive committee of the corporation. \"The management,\" the statement declares, \"should be reasonable in its willingness to listen to any one desiring to discuss matters purporting to affect General Motors employees,\" even, apparently, if the person in question is not a duly accredited spokesman for a group, while \"in the event that an issue is raised by a particular group or their duly accredited representatives the settlement of which involves the interests of non-represented groups, the management should satisfy itself that any decision arrived at provides fair treatment with respect to such non-represented groups.\" Moreover, \"it must be distinctly understood that it is contrary to the letter and the spirit of collective bargaining for the management to attempt by any means to prevent questions as regards same from being raised by the employees and fully discussed with them or their representatives.\" A clearer statement of the meaning and application of the collective bargaining which the Industrial Recovery Act requires could hardly be desired. It is as clear regarding the obligations of management as it is regarding those of labor, and leaves no ground for the criticism that labor is the only party whose rights and duties need to be defined. It gives no recognition in collective bargaining to any labor organization as such, but deals with employees only through \"representatives of their own choosing.\" By inference, therefore, it excludes all interference with bargaining by outside agents of labor unions. It was easier, perhaps, for General Motors to take such a position because there is not in the automobile industry any predominant type of labor organi- Volume 139 Financial Chronicle zation, but the principles enunciated in the statement are as applicable to an industry in which the majority or all of the employees adhere,for example, to the American Federation of Labor as to one in which a company union or several forms of organization are found. It would be gratifying to be able to hope that the General Motors statement would clear the air once for all, and leave collective bargaining to bring the benefits which the National Industrial Recovery Act doubtless contemplated. Unfortunately, there are still some serious obstacles to be overcome. The decision of the National Labor Relations Board upholding the right of a majority of employees to speak for the minority as well stands squarely in the way of the principle which General Motors has championed and which,for obvious reasons, the American Federation of Labor strongly supports. William Green was reported on Monday, in an Associated Press dispatch from San Francisco, as showing \"considerable interest\" in the General Motors statement, but he was also quoted as saying that \"a fundamental point is that the will of the majority of the workers should be followed in settling the point as to what organization is to speak for the workers,\" and as declaring that \"the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board, the steel, petroleum and railway boards have all said so.\" Reports of proceedings in the trial of the Weirton Steel case at Wilmington, Del., have seemed to show that Government counsel themselves have no very clear id"
