        "text": "It was too wet to go out so I started on some Spring Cleaning. I get the urge every year or so, but it doesn’t last long – just till the next sunny day. However, during last week’s little flurry of activity I found an old book tucked away at the back of a shelf. Small, scruffy, tiny print, and bound in a cheap, red coloured, cardboard cover, it could hardly look less inviting. It was part of Cassell’s Pocket Reference Library series, and was titled Proverbs and Maxims. First published in 1910 and reprinted 6 times before the edition now in my hands was put together (1931). There are probably many subsequent additions for, as the compiler John L Rayner quotes on his frontispiece, ‘a good maxim is never out of season.’\n\nI glanced through it idly – thinking this would be marginally more interesting than dusting the shelf – and looked up husbands (half a page of quotations), men (one and a half pages), wives (two and a half pages) and women (over three pages). I can’t be sure, because the original authors were not cited, but the gist of each proverb/maxim suggests that in most cases, they were opined by a man.\n\nTake those on husbands – ‘if a husband be not at home, there is nobody.’ ‘Husbands be in Heaven when wives scold not.’ And so on (mostly) in the same vein.\n\nLikewise, there is a complacency and tolerance about the proverbs on men: ‘Man, woman, and devil are the three degrees of comparison.’ ‘Man is a bundle of habits.’ ‘Every man is the son of his own works.’ A proverb about old men is a bit disparaging – ‘it’s hard to break an old hog of an ill custom.’ But this is nothing on the general gist of proverbs about women.\n\nWives in particular, get a raw deal. ‘He that has a wife has strife.’ ‘Wives and wind are necessary evil.’ ‘Wife and children are bills of charges.’ But women in general don’t fare much better. The most complimentary was, at best, patronising. ‘A good woman is worth, if she were sold, the fairest crown that’s made of pure gold.’ Which is better, I suppose, than ‘A man of straw is worth a woman of gold.’\n\nMost however are plain nasty, and stress the importance of keeping a woman in her place. ‘Women are ships, and must be manned.’ Women are the devil’s nets.’ ‘When an ass climbs a ladder, we may find wisdom in a woman.’ And my all-time least favourite – ‘a woman, a dog, and a walnut tree, the more you beat them, the better they’ll be.’\n\nWell, it’s a booklet from a hundred years ago, you may say. Things are so much better these days. True. When it was first published, women did not have the vote. And it is only in the last 50 or so years that women have been able to open bank accounts or take on a mortgage without permission from their husband or father, that the Football Association has graciously allowed women and girls to play football, and that athletics has permitted women to run in marathons. None of this has happened without a fight by women (and some men), so it’s great that Jasmin Paris, a young British woman, and the first woman ever to complete the Barkley ultra-endurance race in under 60 hours, has dedicated her achievement earlier this month ‘to woman everywhere.’\n\nBecause in other spheres, ‘progress’ is not always so evident. The NHS talks about ‘people with ovaries’ rather than acknowledge that these are bodily parts unique to women (though they have no problem talking about men getting checked out for prostate problems), and many UK politicians struggle to say what a woman is for fear of upsetting trans identifying males. The responses to women who object to this obfuscation are often crudely worded versions of the centuries old maxim ‘Let women spin, and not preach.’\n\nFurther afield, the situation is much worse, particularly in Afghanistan where women and girls have no rights and are not allowed to leave home without a male relative as a chaperone. No school, no work, no entertainment, no sporting activities – not even a walk in the park. Women out unaccompanied risk arrest, physical punishment, prison or even death (though the purity police, aka the Taliban, aren’t averse to a bit of punitive rape of such ‘loose women’ alongside these other measures). And allegations of adultery are now likely to end in death by stoning – just for the woman, of course. This in a country where 50 years ago young women dressed like me and, like me, were free to go to university and to work. No wonder the suicide rate among women and girls is so high there at the moment.\n\nSo well may we snigger at the old fashioned, misogynistic, attitudes evident in this little book of maxims and proverbs. But scratch the surface and many such sentiments are still around in western ‘civilised’ countries. And they are pretty much Government policy in some countries, notably Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nAnd now the sun is out, and it is unlikely to rain for the next few days, so my spring cleaning has come to an abrupt halt. Long may the sun shine!\n\nLinks to my books and social media\n\nYou can find all my books and short stories on Amazon books, At least one story always free.

He is also the power behind fantom publishishing and Rosie’s Retro Bazaar. He took time out of his busy schedule to answer a few questions about what these, and Book Extravaganza, are all about.\n\nHello Dexter, can you tell me a bit about yourself, Fantom Publishing and Rosie’s Retro Bazaar.\n\nFantom was established 19 years ago, almost to the day! Over the past two decades we have published around 400 print and audio titles.\n\nWe have worked with lots of fantastic authors including autobiographies of actors Paul Nicholas, Julian Glover, Geoffrey Beevers, Jack Wild and Derek Fowlds. We have many more biography and Cult TV and Film related titles which are too many to mention.\n\nRecently, we have published the novelisations of One Foot in the Grave by the series’ creator David Renwick, and a collection of scripts by comedy writing duo Marks and Gran.\n\nFor as long as I can remember I’ve been involved with the arts, working professionally for ITV as a youth, however it was my involvement with the television station at Warwick University – whist completing my degree – that demonstrated to me what was possible.\n\nThe venture and my previous experience inspired me to start an audio-visual enterprise which over the first couple of years developed into a publishing house and events company.\n\nThrough fantom we have organised over 200 events – which is amazing! Prior to lockdown I developed Retrospective Ltd and the Rosie’s Retro Bazaar brand through my love of Mid-century design. This is principally a retro and village market, but this has recently expanded to include heritage themed events.\n\nI was inspired into producing audio books by my grandmother, who after going blind relied on them for storytelling and entertainment. If she enjoyed an audio book or play, she would pass me the cassette and I would take a listen.\n\nIt was this that gave me the opportunity to learn about the industry and inspired me to move into print – egged on by one of my audio book readers (actress Mary Tamm) who said she was looking for a publisher for her autobiography First Generation.\n\nSo, what is a Book Extravaganza?\n\nIt is an event like no other, we are bringing together a variety of independent and small businesses which have a connection to books and the art of storytelling.\n\nAcross two floors of the Belgrade Theatre, we have a collection of authors with a plethora of styles and subject matters – from local interest to children’s fiction and true crime to science fiction!\n\nWe have themed stalls from audio books to LGBTQI+ as well as antiquarian and second handbooks.\n\nJoining this, will be a host of stalls inspired by the history of books, associated crafts, and tools. For example, cards made from ladybird artwork and beyond. Journals, stationery, pens, and bookmarks!\n\nIf you are an aspiring writer, and looking at routes to market, we have printers and author services to give you more inspiration and ideas. We have Illustrators and comic creators.\n\nThere are also talks and performance work including Coventry’s Young Poet Laureate Aamani Kanda who will be reciting some of her poetry – you will be able to find out more on our website.\n\nWhy did you decide to hold the Book Extravaganza in Coventry?\n\nCoventry is my home city and community, culture and developing the local economy is a big motivator for me. I want to give local authors and businesses a new shop window to display their talents in the hope it enhances the image of the city and the opportunities within.\n\nIt will be in the Belgrade, Coventry, 10am – 4pm – is that right?\n\nThat’s correct, the event will run from 10am until 4pm. The talks and performance schedule will be announced online and via social media this week.\n\nHow much will it cost to take part or to attend?\n\nThe event is FREE to attend, however if you are an author or small business related to the book or storytelling industries you can apply for a stall via our website. But hurry we only have a couple left!\n\nWho will be there and who do you hope will attend?\n\nThe event is open to everyone whether you are an avid reader, budding writer or just browsing. It is an ideal opportunity to find that unique gift or unusual title.\n\nHow will people get in touch with you if they want to be part of it?\n\nYou can message us online via any of our social media channels or through our websites www.fantompublishing.co.uk and www.rosiesretrobazaar.co.uk\n\nDo you see this as an annual event in Coventry?\n\nWe are hoping this becomes a biannual event, the positive response talking to book groups and people online gives me the confidence that this will be a different event which can continue to grow! Watch this space!\n\nWhat do you see happening afterwards in Coventry (or elsewhere)?\n\nWe have been approached by a couple of other locations in the Midlands who are keen to host a Book Extravaganza; and we hope to have another in Coventry in the lead up to Christmas.\n\nOn 8th June we have our next Twentieth Century Market, which is moving from Drapers’ Hall to the Belgrade Theatre. This event is a retro and vintage fair which encompasses fashion, furniture and homewares.\n\nFantom run approximately a dozen Doctor Who conventions and events across the country including locations in Sheffield, Bristol, Milton Keynes and London. We did our first convention in Coventry last year and plans are afoot for the next!\n\nThe Belgrade is keen for us to continue and present more events for them, so again watch this space! Who knows what will happen next.\n\nAnything else you want to add?\n\nWe are supporting Listening Books charity at this event; a national audiobook charity providing an online audiobook service for the print impaired.\n\n40% of revenue from our audio book stall will go direct to the charity and there will also be a raffle to win audio books signed by the writers and readers.\n\nIt’s a charity close to my heart as the art of audio can bring a new world of storytelling, knowledge, and entertainment whether that’s due to a physical impairment or age. It brings me full circle as I saw firsthand with my grandmother and what difference audio can make.\n\nOur inaugural Book Extravaganza is FREE to attend, however if you pre-register your interest at www.rosiesretrobazaar.co.uk you can be entered into a raffle to win £75s worth of books!\n\nSounds like a definite date for the diary. Thank you so much for your time, Dexter, and look forward to seeing you on the 6th April at the Belgrade.\n\nSome pictures from Dexter’s album to whet your appetite\n\nThe late June Brown – reading a copy of Jack Wild’s autobiography It’s a Dodger’s Life. One of my favourite photos!!\n\nAuthors Catherine Schell & Derek Fowlds swapping books! Catherine was a bond girl!\n\nThe late Peter Vaughan (Porridge, Game of Thrones…) signed copies of his autobiography Once A Villian.\n\nKen Farrington at a book signing – he was best know for being Billy Walker in Corrie.\n\nThese last three are of Mary Tamm – she was Tom Bakers companion in Doctor Who. There are photos of her with my first book, and reading the audio book.\n\nPS: Links to Margaret’s books and social media\n\nYou can find all my books and short stories on Amazon books, At least one story always free.

The word is closely associated with the verb, to collocate – to group or place items together in some system or order (like, if you still have them, your DVDs, CDs, cassettes or records). It can also mean the way we group together words in a sentence.\n\nSo, linguistically, what is collocation?\n\nCollocation is ‘a predictable combination of words.’ For example, we can say ‘heavy rain,’ but not ‘strong rain’ because it does not sound right. Likewise, we tend to ‘do exercise’ but not ‘make exercise’. We talk about someone’s ‘cute little puppy,’ not her ‘little cute puppy.’\n\nCollocations can be made up of any kinds of words such as verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjectives. Although people have attempted to draw up rules – adverb before adjective (or is it vice-versa?) – there are no hard and fast rules for collocations. They are just combinations of words that we become familiar with, and then use correctly without thinking. Because there are no rules, people who have not been immersed in the language since birth will sometimes get it wrong, giving us native English speakers a completely unjustified (and often very temporary) sense of superiority over foreigners.\n\nLinguists also use the term, collocation, to refer to the regular association of one particular word with another. Several people I know can never be frank, they are always ‘brutally frank;’ many optimists are said to have ‘rose-tinted spectacles,’ English landladies in seaside towns will offer you a ‘hearty breakfast’ before you set off for a ‘bracing walk.’ What is ‘fish,’ without ‘chips’?\n\nNew collocations spring up regularly – is there now any other intelligence than artificial intelligence? Or fade out of use – who worries about addled eggs in these days of refrigeration?\n\nSometimes, the difference between a collocation and a cliché is pretty blurred – are ‘a time bomb,’ or ‘a ticking clock,’ happy collocations or irritating, over-used, phrases that slide into many articles on, for example, climate change / the economy / the crisis in the NHS ….?\n\nNB: Collocation – from Latin – collocare (co – together, plus locare – place)\n\nLinks to my books and social media\n\nYou can find all my books and short stories on Amazon books, At least one story always free.

Not surprisingly, there is a huge volume of fan fiction written about the Harry Potter characters and the author, JK Rowling, is said not to mind – so long as the writers do not try to sell their work.\n\nFan fiction is rarely authorised and is technically illegal as the writer uses copyrighted characters and settings, and encroaches upon the intellectual property rights of the original author. Copyright law grants the holder the exclusive right to control how their work is used and identified. Many authors, like JK Rowling, are aware of the fan fiction their work inspires but see it as largely harmless, maybe even of benefit to any young person trying their hand at it as it develops their imagination. Established authors will rarely, if ever, read any of it though; partly because they have better things to do with their free time, partly through fear of being accused of ‘stealing’ an idea from a fan for a future book.\n\nOne of the worst examples of Fan fic, I am told, is My Immortal, which is based on Harry Potter books, but shows scant regard for the actual characters and is riddled with typos and grammar mistakes. Many other works aren’t much better, and some developments in fan fiction are increasingly giving the genre a bad name.\n\nSlash fiction is a sub group of fan fiction. It focuses on same sex romantic/sexual relationships between characters that was neither intended nor implied by the original author. It is so called because the slash (/) is used to indicate that the relationship is sexual (e.g. Noddy / Big Ears). Friendship is indicated by ‘&’ (Noddy & Big Ears). The sexual relationship is usually between 2 male characters (m/m). If it is between two females (f/f) it is called femslash or femme slash.\n\nThis is still pretty harmless, you may think. But some writers of fan fiction go further – Angst fic, or even Dark fic where the plot lines become increasingly violent and sexual – rape, incest, murder, torture, suicide ….\n\nThe journalist and women’s rights campaigner, Dr Helen Joyce, first wrote about fan fiction in The Economist in 2016 when her editor asked her to look into the potential impact of pornography on young people. She had not paid any attention to fan fiction before, and had never heard of slash fiction, but in her initial research she found a link between them and porn. She included in her article her concern about the impression this could be making on the many young female readers who like reading fan fiction.\n\nSubsequently she was contacted by a number of parents who agreed with her, but also felt that slash fiction was creating, or compounding, their daughters’ feelings of gender dysphoria – initially starting with the girl identifying as one of the gay boys in a fan fictional relationship, rather than a female character from the original book. However, in most of the slash fiction of that era (remember, this is less than 8 years ago) the relationships were not explicit, and the romance element virtually sexless. Ostensibly, many storylines seemed relatively tame – for some girls a temporary haven away from the anxious realities of first periods, developing breasts, and boyfriends in real life.\n\nHelen Joyce has recently gone back to research the topic, and found, in keeping with modern angsts, a plethora of fan fiction characters were now in therapy of some form or another. She has been shocked, too, to find that the fan/slash genre has become much more pornified, violent and explicit than even a few years ago, with anal sex, choking, spitting and slapping seen as ‘normal,’ even on a first date (and a million miles away from the behaviour of the characters in the original books). These degrading porn storylines however do correlate with recent research done with young people about the impact of porn on their lives. It appears that many have had access to explicit and violent porn from a young age, and that girls understand this behaviour to be what they could expect from boys in real-life sexual relationships, or be seen as prudes. Certain strands of fan fiction, that to the uninitiated sounds like an innocent, adolescent, vehicle for fandom in regard to a favourite author, seem to have become very dark indeed.\n\nLinks to my books and social media\n\nMy work, as far as I know, is a fan-fiction-free-zone.

Those like Katie Price (a.k.a. the model, Jordan), and another model, Naomi Campbell who ‘wrote’ the easily forgettable novel Swan, are easy to disparage. Their relationship with pen and paper is similar to Dolly Parton’s relationship with her hairdresser: when asked how long it took her hairdresser to concoct such a mass of curls Dolly allegedly replied ‘I don’t know, I’m never there.’ But at least she was open about the contrivance, unlike Price and Campbell whose creations were brought into this world by faceless ghost writers.\n\nIt’s not so easy to dismiss the work of some of the other people who became famous for something other than writing before succumbing to the urge to pen their memoirs or take a foray into fiction. Stephen Fry was an intellectual who first came to our attention as a comic actor and was well capable of writing a novel about the holocaust, Making History, and many others. Around half a century earlier, Dirk Bogarde wrote six well received novels as well as being a film star.\n\nToday we have TV personality Richard Osman’s Thursday Murder Club series, which appears to have struck a chord with the general public and I, for one, certainly enjoy reading his books. And there’s rumour of a pending novel from Taylor Swift, which I may pass on.\n\nThere’s no doubt that celebrities get an easy ride when it comes to finding a publisher, as the publisher knows the name alone will guarantee sales. Often, enough sales to make it worth their while to give them a generous advance (think Prince Harry and Spare). But a famous name doesn’t guarantee sales. The actress Celia Imrie was promised a contract for a novel she was thinking about writing – a novel she did in fact complete, but it didn’t exactly fly off the shelves.\n\nThose of us who write without the luxury of fame, struggle to get an agent’s or publisher’s attention. After 20 or so rejections, it is easy to feel a bit aggrieved that one’s hidden masterpiece is destined to remain just that – hidden. But the commentator Charlie Connolly has pointed out that publishers who take on celebrity authors and go on to sell thousands of copies of their work(s) keep those publishing houses solvent. They are therefore in a position to offer contracts to a few unknowns too, who may or may not bring in a return on their investment. There would, he argues, be fewer publishers if there was a ban on celebrity publishing (which would be impossible to enforce anyway).\n\nMajor celebrities who want to see their words in print are snatched up by the big-name publishers, but there are plenty of other publishers that an unknown would-be author can try. Reputable ones don’t charge to publish, but they will expect you to do all the leg-work in regard to marketing and promotion, and buy your own copies to sell at launches etc. Alternatively, some authors choose to pay an often quite hefty fee to a publisher to get their book out – and still find they have to do their own marketing, with the promised support evaporating after their last payment.\n\nIt’s not surprising therefore that writers turn to self-publishing. Some of the more enterprising ones set up their own publishing business for their own books and maybe a few friends who write in the same genre. There are some famous precedents: Virginia Woolf couldn’t get a publisher, so her husband set up a publishing house for her, Hogarth Press, that is still going strong – as are her books.\n\nGalling as it may be that the works of the celebrities make a seemingly effortless rise to the top of the pile of manuscripts by a publisher’s desk – and then sell in numbers that often far outweigh their true worth – it is unlikely that they really are the reason why it is so hard for most of us to get published. And yes, that is a green-eyed monster perched on my left shoulder.\n\nLinks to my books and social media\n\nYou can find all my books and short stories on Amazon books, At least one story always free.
