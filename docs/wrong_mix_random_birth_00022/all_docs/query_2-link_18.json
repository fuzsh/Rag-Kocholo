Indeed, when it does not serve the artistic purpose, it acts as a barrier and creates a fourth wall that distances the artist from the audience.\n\nConversely, when it finds its natural balance, it becomes a true support, an indisputable ally of the stage production. This pursuit of accuracy and the desire to provide support guide our work.\n\nUnisson Design is also about the alliance of forces, starting with the two sound designers, Cyril AUCLAIR and Léonard FRANÇON, who rely on a network of excellence within the sound reinforcement industry.\n\nWith a solid experience, acquired and tested over many years through national and international productions, as well as an in-depth knowledge of the field, this alliance continues to deliver results renowned for their quality.\n\nRecently, Unisson Design has distinguished itself in the following creations:Cabaret, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at Lido 2 Paris Zazie dans le Metro at MCA Peau d’Ane, Funny Girl at Théâtre Marigny, Le Vol du Boli, 42nd Street at Théâtre du Chatelet, and with Bartabas at the Seine Musicale for Stravinsky’s The Rite and Mozart’s Requiem.\n\nTheatre credits include: Back to the Future The Musical, Grease, Elf, Time Traveller’s Wife, Into the Woods, Waitress, Only Fools & Horses, Magic Mike Live, Matilda (Adult casting), 42nd Street, Bat Out of Hell, 5 Guys Named Moe, Ghost, Our House (West End); Mamma Mia!
