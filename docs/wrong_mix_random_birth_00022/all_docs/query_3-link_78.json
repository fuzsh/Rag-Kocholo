It's been so enjoayable that we thought we should document the group playing Williams music live in a studio. This document is not in anyway trying to compete with the amazing work that William Onyeabor did originally. This is a limited LP only edition which we hope you enjoy.

It's been denigrated and damned, boycotted and banned, but it can never be stopped: champeta, the ever evolving, high-energy hybrid of Columbian, African and Afro-Caribbean styles just keeps on coming. And leading a new charge are Tribu BaharÃº, barrelling out of BogotÃ¡, championing their version of champeta, inspired by the legendary, street-shaking Pico sound-systems of Columbia's Caribbean coast. Sparkling Congolese guitar driven by high-speed bass and drums and the all-animating upfront singers. Champeta was swept away by the ubiquitous Reggaeton in the '90s but Tribu BaharÃº are part of a wave of nuevas musicas Colombianas based in the capital city who are reestablishing it as a prime force and adding more ingredients to the recipe. Contain traces of soukous, zouk, calypso, mbaqanga, soca, compa Haitiano, rap and ragamuffin. Essential ammunition for the globally-minded DJ. Â Limited-edition of 500 pressed. 7â 45RPM on black vinyl. Comes in full-color die-cut sleeve with center hole and full-color label.Â\n\n1. Pa Tras 2.

Amidst intense media speculation about the band's next move, the single bridged what was then considered a long gap between the Revolver album, released in August 1966, and Sgt. Pepper, which followed ten months later.Â\n\n\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\"\n\n\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" The Beatles Beatles Apple Corp./Capitol Records 7\" Vinyl RSD Exclusive 7000\n\nBettie Serveert\n\nDamaged Good\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/22/2017\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: Schoolkids Records\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Limited Run / Regional Focus\n\nMORE INFO\n\nDutch indie legends Bettie Serveert return on their 25th Anniversary with their 11th studio album, Damaged Good.

Look no further than this limited edition compilation of tracks culled from across the artist's catalog of 9-plus albums. The legendary lo-fi band began in the small town of Wivenhoe, southeast England at the turn of 1980s. Essentially the project of Martin Newell, a rock singer and part-time kitchen porter with a love of sunny 1960s pop music, punk rock and musical comedy, he never cared much for any kind of musical rule book and broke new ground with music that garnered a cult following. Newell created a highly influential sound that continues to inspire to this day. The absolute opposite of a musical perfectionist, the founder Cleaner believed that great pop was to be had by doing things quickly, in slapdash fashion and by \"fumbling around in the dark in search of happy accidents.\"\n\nSIDE ONE: Â 01 A Blue Wave 02 Marathon 03 Marilyn on a Train 04 Only a Shadow 05 Corridor of Dreams 06 Golden Age Saturday 07 Johnny the Moondog 08 Songs for Syd Barrett / 3:59\n\nSIDE TWO: 01 Julie Profumo 02 Gamma Ray Blue 03 Follow the Plough 04 The Mercury Girl 05 Germayne (Like a Catherdal) 06 The Tear Collector 07 Haunt Your HouseÂ\n\nBest OfÂ Cleaners From Venus Cleaners Captured Tracks LP RSD Limited Run / Regional Focus 400\n\nNels Cline\n\nIn the Wee Small Hours\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/22/2017\n\nFormat: 7\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: Blue Note Records\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Limited Run / Regional Focus\n\nMORE INFO\n\nNels Cline cover of Frank Sinatra's track \"In The Wee Small Hours\"\n\nIn the Wee Small Hours Nels Cline Cline Blue Note Records 7\" Vinyl RSD Limited Run / Regional Focus 1000\n\nCoheed and Cambria\n\nGood Apollo, IÂm Burning Star IV\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/22/2017\n\nLabel: Sony Legacy\n\nQuantity: 2500\n\nRelease type: 'RSD First'\n\nMORE INFO\n\nReleased in 2005, the breakthrough third studio album by progressive rockers Coheed and Cambria continued the bandâs ambitious four-album âArmory Warsâ sci-fi storyline and featured the mainstream rock hit âWelcome Home.â Now, Good Apollo, Iâm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness is remastered from the original sources and pressed on vinyl for the first time as a 2LP set on exclusive splatter vinyl.\n\nGood Apollo, IÂm Burning Star IV Coheed and Cambria Coheed Sony Legacy 'RSD First' 2500\n\nJerry Cole\n\nThe Astro-Sound From Beyond The Year 2000\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/22/2017\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: Modern Harmonic\n\nQuantity: 630\n\nRelease type: RSD Limited Run / Regional Focus\n\nMORE INFO\n\nGuitar mastery meets the space age bachelor pad with a healthy mix of controversy. The Astro-Sound of Magnificence, from Beyond the Year 2000...a unique capsule of a funky, psychedelic rhythm section jamming, with snarling, stabbing and swooshing cranked-up-to-infinity electric guitar voyages piloted by Wrecking Crew veteran Jerry Cole, polished and primed for takeoff with a string section playing eerie, beckoning melodies in unison. These are the sounds of epiphanies concerning the future, space and sounds on the horizon, circa 1969.

The Astro-Sound of Magnificence, from Beyond the Year 2000...a unique capsule of a funky, psychedelic rhythm section jamming, with snarling, stabbing and swooshing cranked-up-to-infinity electric guitar voyages piloted by Wrecking Crew veteran Jerry Cole, polished and primed for takeoff with a string section playing eerie, beckoning melodies in unison. These are the sounds of epiphanies concerning the future, space and sounds on the horizon, circa 1969.

Wu-Tang Clan's Inspectah Deck & Esoteric carved a niche for Czarface with venomous vocals, but the musical production is their super power. Powered by the trademark sound of 7L and Todd Spadafore (The Czar-Keys), a sound that's been developed since Czarface's first LP in 2013, First Weapon Drawn serves as the soundtrack to Czarface's mysterious origin. Fresh off of their collaboration with Marvel Comics, Czarface has not only delivered a new audio adventure complete with narration, it has given us an extra large, full color, action-packed 24 page comic book with it, housed in a beautiful gatefold jacket! In the spirit of the highly sought after Power Records series from the 70's, you can read along with the comic and hear the story come to life on vinyl.\n\nSIDE A: 1. Czarface Theme 2.

In particular, The Cure became a mainstay for both, and they would use elements of the layered moodiness and the swirling guitars combined with hardcore to create an emotionally punishing soundscape in DAMANTION A.D. From their very early recordings, DAMNATION A.D. would pay homage to the great influence of The Cure by covering ''Cold.'' During that same session almost 25 years ago, the idea to cover Pornography in its entirety was formed. Over the next two and a half decades, the band secretly worked on this project, constantly revising it. Rumors started to circulate to the point where it became an urban myth. Finally, 25 years since the ideas was conceived, their dream of paying tribute to one of their most important influences will see the light of day. This is the first new Damnation AD release in ten years, and it's released on a limited number of clear blue vinyl LPs for Record Store Day 2017.\n\n1. One Hundred Years 2. A Short Term Effect 3.

Marianne Faithfull had this to say about the 1971 recordings: âThe record itself is very strange and ghostly. Itâs the voice of somebody incredibly high, probably on the edge of death. They always sound like that. Johnny Thunders sounds like that. Anybody who heard that record would have said, âWell thatâs that. Weâll never hear from her againâ.â Recorded in 1972, but not released until 1985, this silver vinyl reissue brings it back into print for Record Store Day.Â\n\nRich Kid Blues Marianne Faithfull Faithfull AEC Imports/Demon LP RSD Exclusive 2000\n\nFat Joe & Remy Ma\n\nPlata O Plomo\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/22/2017\n\nLabel: EMPIRE/RNG\n\nQuantity: 1500\n\nRelease type: 'RSD First'\n\nMORE INFO\n\nFat Joe and Remy Ma release their debut collaborative album, Plata o Plomo.

J. Spaceman (Spacemen 3, Spiritualized), they discovered they were kindred spirits. FÃ¶llakzoid and Spaceman's projects share a restless drive to explore the outer limits of music, as well as an uncanny ability to lock into a groove until it infiltrates the deepest recesses of the listener's psyche. When FÃ¶llakzoid met Spaceman backstage at a Wooden Shjips gig at London's Electric Ballroom several years ago, they instantly became friends. For London Sessions, the Chileans and Spaceman joined forces for new, live-to-tape renditions of \"Electric\" and \"Earth,\" two highlights from FÃ¶llakzoid's III. The recordings were made in a private studio in London while FÃ¶llakzoid was on tour in Europe in June 2016, and Spaceman's contributions breathe new life into the songs. \"Jason added a very different harmonic atmosphere to the songs,\" guitarist Domingo Garcia-Huidobro explained. \"It somehow rearticulated the space and metric that already existed in a way the band never could. These new versions have a different edge.\"\n\n(A): Electric (11:37)\n\n(B): Earth (11:21)\n\nLondon Sessions Follakzoid feat. J.

While Frankie And The Witch Fingers seem to incorporate a few more dissonant sounds and breaks, think 13th Floor Elevators or The Velvet Underground, to really spice up the sound and add a level of dissonance to the tightly crafted garage pop melodies, that just seem to melt out of your speakers. Reverberation and fuzz dosed guitars shimmer and undulate in the songs, while echoed vocals float above the instruments, blending in and out of fits of distortion and rave-ups. The bass and drums are like calm pounding waves, powerful enough to chip away at a mountain with out raising an un-needed racket while doing so. Tracks slowly build moment and break into amazing walls of sound and distortion, before fading back into the shadows to reveal the skeletal melody of the song again to let you take it all back in one more time before youâre done. My favorite tracks are when they just hit the gas though, pounding riffs and thundering bass twisting together like a Porsche hitting a lamp post at a hundred and eighty miles an hour, taking your mind along for the ride!

But the classic American music that Graffin pays homage to here, in both carefully chosen covers and in his own songwriting, forms the backbone of Bad Religion's epic tales of the young and the poor, mired by misery and poverty. Cold as the Clay honors the traditional folk music that Graffin grew up listening to, with original rock compositions that drew inspiration from the folk rock of Gram Parsons and Neil Young, as well as traditional American Folk music. The album was produced by Brett Gurewitz and features guest performances by singer Jolie Holland and The Wearkerthans as backing musicians. In celebration of both the 10th anniversary of this release and the 10th Record Store Day, Cold as the Clay will be pressed on LP for the first time, in a limited run of metallica gold vinyl.\n\nSIDE A: 01 Don't Be Afraid To Run 02 Omie Wise 03 Cold As The Clay 04 Little Sadie 05 The Highway 06 Rebel's Goodbye\n\nSIDE B: 01 Talk About Suffering 02 Willie Moore 03 California Cotton Fields 04 Watchmaker's Dial 05 One More Hill\n\nCold As The Clay Greg Graffin Graffin ANTI- LP RSD Exclusive 1500\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nP.N.E.
