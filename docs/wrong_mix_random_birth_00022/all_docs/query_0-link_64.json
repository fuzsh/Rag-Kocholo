        "text": "SABAN-PARSONS, MARY Military\n\nBorn in the humble surroundings of a California mining town, Mary Saban Parsons served in the U.S. Navy, raised children, received a college degree late in life and, according to her friends, valued her origins. She died of heart disease Tuesday in a Roseville care center at age 87. Her parents had known each other in Croatia. Her mother arrived in Northern California in 1913, four years after her father. He worked at the Mammoth copper mine. Mrs. Parsons was born in Kennett, near the Shasta County mine, which is now under the waters of Shasta Lake. Her early life was a series of dirt-floor mining camps in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and California. \"She said it was a hard life but a good life,\" said her friend Rita Lind. \"Her family was very close and there was a lot of love. She said her parents were always inviting other miners, especially those from the old country, to eat or stay with them. \"They didn't have much but they shared all of it,\" said Lind. All the moving caused Mary to fall two years behind in school. Her mother finally put her foot down, saying that the girl needed to stay in one place long enough to catch up and start high school. The family moved to Sacramento where she attended St. Joseph's Academy. Her father commuted to mining jobs. Mrs. Parsons graduated in 1935 and went to work for the telephone company as a switchboard operator in Nevada City. When she got a job with the U.S. Forest Service in Nevada City she met a schoolteacher named Charles Parsons. In 1943 Mrs. Parsons joined the WAVES, serving at the 12th Naval District staff headquarters in San Francisco. It was quite an experience for a small-town girl in a big city during a war, said Lind. \"She was the shy and quiet one. When the rest of the girls wanted to go into town and have some drinks, she'd be the one urging caution,\" Lind said. In 1944 she married Charles Parsons. She was discharged as a Yeoman Third Class in 1945. The couple moved to Auburn after the war where her husband taught and was an administrator for Placer schools and a junior college. In 1962 they moved to Roseville when Charles Parsons was appointed superintendent of the Roseville Joint High School District. After their two daughters were grown, Mrs. Parsons attended Sierra College and in 1976 was awarded an associate of arts degree. She was 64 years old and, at that time, the oldest person to earn the AA degree from the college. \"She was just the epitome of a good person,\" said Lind. \"Everybody else came first. She was -- a lady.\" Late in life, Mrs. Parsons was stricken with Alzheimer's disease, curtailing her contact with her close friends and her beloved Croatian cooking. Besides her husband of 58 years, Mrs. Parsons is survived by her daughters, Pamela Mary Hughes, of Decatur, Ga., and Rebecca Sharon Andersen, of Oakland, and three grandchildren.\n\nSABICH PIONEERS\n\nMattias Sabich. The first Croatian pioneer was Mattias Sabich, coming from Mexico to Los Angeles in 1834. He had a son, Matias, in 1841 and a son, Francisco, in 1842 in Los Angeles. Matias was a trader and merchant. He was listed as an Austrian on the 1860 Census of Population, but at a later date his son, Francisco, an orchardist, had employed John Cuculich as a nurseryman. Both of these names are found in Dalmatia. Sabich planted the first orange groves in Los Angeles. All foreigners who became colonists in the Californias who observe the constitution and laws of the Republic will be Mexican citizens as soon as they build their own houses and begin to cultivate their lands. One of the first outgrowths of the new movement toward colonization was the Gomez Farijas Colony. In February 1834 signs began to appear in Mexico City inviting men, women and families to join a colonial adventure to settle California. Among the three hundred or so colonists who left Mexico on August 1, 1834 was a trader named Matias Sabich or Sabici (1798-1852). Sabich married Josefa Franco Lazard, a member of one of the leading families in Mexican and early American California. Her brother Don Antonio Franco Coronel, was one of the first mayors of Los Angeles and Ygnacio Coronel founded the citys first school. Matias fathered two sons, Mattias and Francisco and he became a well-known and apparently wealthy member of the community. Sabichs wife died in Los Angeles and is buried at San Gabriel mission.\n\nFrancisco Sabich, a member of the Society of Los Angeles Pioneers, who died suddenly of heart disease on the 12th of April, 1900, in the 59th year of his age, was a native of this city. He was born October 4, 1842. His father, Matias Sabich, was a native of Croatia, who came to Los Angeles at a very early day; and his mother was Josefa, daughter of Don Ygnacio Coronel, and sister of Antonio F. Coronel. Matias Sabich in 1852, after the death of his wife, took his two boys, Francisco and Matias, and set out on his return to his native land, but he died on the way. His two sons were taken in charge on their arrival in England by the American consul, Mr. Joseph Rodney Croskey, who became a true foster-father to them, taking them into his own family and carefully educating them. Frank was in the British navy three years. Matias was a portion of the time at school in France. Both learn to speak French, and of course English and Spanish, the latter being their mother tongue. They returned to Los Angeles in 1860, having been away about eight years. Matias Sabich was accidentally shot while on a hunting trip, from the effects of which he died not long afterwards. Frank studied law and was admitted to the bar. He was several times elected a member of the City Council in the early 70's and also once in the 80's. In 1865, he was married to Magdalena, daughter of Wm. Wolfskill, the pioneer. She, with their eight children survive him. What is interesting is that La Casa Primera De Rancho San Jose, one of the first houses in the city of Ponoma (Los Angeles County), possesses the wedding dress that Mardalena Wolfskill wore on her wedding day. She married one of the Mattias Sabichs sons on May 4, 1865 in Los Angeles. Her father was very wealthy and one of the pioneers who gave his money to his daughter and son-in-law. The present-day family of the Sabichs gave the wedding dress in the 1960s to a historical house to preserve a sample of the style worn in 1865. Mr. Sabich was prominently identified with the \"Sons of the Golden West\", being at the time of his death, a grand trustee of the order for the State of California.\n\nSABICH, VLADIMIR Skiing Champion-Military\n\nDownhill skier Vladimir Spider Sabich from Kyburz, California, placed fifth in the slalom event at the 1968 WInter Olympic in Grenoble, France. Turning professional in 1971, he was twice professional world champion on the pro circuit. Sabich suffered a career- threatening back injury in 1973 but staged a dramatic comeback to capture the prestigious Benson and Hedges special slalom event at Mount Snow, Vermont, in January, 1974. He swept past his opposition including second place finisher Mike Schwaiger of Austria, in surprisingly easy fashion. Forty professional skiers turned out for the competition, staged on a 36 gate course which dropped 450 feet on a 1,800 foot layout. Said to be the inspiration for Robert Redfords film Downhill Racer, Sabich died tragically in a shooting incident involving actress Claudine Longet in Aspen, Colorado, in March, 1976.\n\nSabich started skiing at the age of 5. By her best guess, Frances Sabich figures her three children -- Mary, Spider and Steve -- broke at least 15 bones combined. \"We had someone in a cast every winter,\" said Frances, who lives with her husband, Vladimir, in Colusa, California. The son of Croatian immigrants, Vladimir Sabich flew B-25 bombers for the U.S. in World War II and spent a year in a Siberian camp after being shot down over the northern part of Japan. In 1945 the Sabiches named their first son Vladimir, but he was never known by anything other than Spider.\n\n\"He was a long baby, but he had no flesh on him,\" Vladimir said. \"He was all skin and bones. I said, 'Geez, he looks like a spider.\"'\n\nVladimir and Frances moved from Sacramento to Kyburz in 1950. The handful of kids who attended Silver Fork Elementary -- a one-room schoolhouse to this day -- went to class in the summer and skied in the winter. The Sabich children competed for the Red Hornet team at Edelweiss, a popular hill that closed down in the early 1960s. The Kyburz kids sometimes hitched rides up the highway in Vladimir's patrol car. There was a Catholic church across the road from Edelweiss where Spider and Steve served as altar boys on Sunday mornings before strapping on their skis. After a brief fling with high school football -- \"The way he played football, he was only going to get hurt,\" Vladimir said -- Sabich accepted a skiing scholarship to the University of Colorado in Boulder. Bob Beattie was the coach, and his skiers included Sabich, Kidd, Jimmy Heuga, James \"Moose\" Barrows and Ni Orsi -- Olympians all. Steve Sabich also went to Colorado on a ski scholarship, but a knee injury ended his career prematurely.\n\n There were two things interesting about Spider,\" Beattie said. \"He had a great sense of humor and a lot of flair. He was a great-looking guy, very spirited. But he also majored in engineering when he came to Colorado. His mind worked very thoroughly, as an engineer's would. He had these two opposite sides to him.\" Kidd and Heuga won Olympic medals in 1964, pioneering a breakthrough for the U.S. men's team in the European-dominated sport. Sabich's shot at Olympic glory came four years later. The top Americans spent the latter part of 1967 training in France, and a dispute over the bill in a fancy restaurant on New Year's Eve landed Sabich and Kidd in a Grenoble jail. \"It was an adventure,\" Kidd said. \"We were in pretty good spirits that night.\" Less than two months later, Sabich finished fifth in the Olympic slalom. The race was marred by fog and mist that greatly limited visibility. \"It was so foggy, we never saw Spider,\" Vladimir says. \"We heard him go by, but we didn't see him.\" Sabich left the US Ski Team in 1970 to join Beattie's pro circuit. He was the perfect ambassador -- photogenic, colorful and articulate. He was also unbeatable, or so it seemed in 1971 and 1972, when he achieved his greatest results. The competition wasn't as strong as it was on the World Cup circuit, but Sabich finished first in the first pro race he entered and won nine of 18 events in 1972. He earned $50,600 that year, when his combined income from prize winnings and endorsements exceeded $150,000.\n\nDede Brinkman, a longtime friend who has lived in Aspen since 1970, explains the attraction she and other women felt toward Sabich. \"He was so charming and very sexy,\" Brinkman said. \"It was the same type of charisma you see in movie stars.\" Sabich moved from Boulder to the Aspen area in 1971. The home that Steve Sabich built for his brother at a cost of $90,000 in neighboring Starwood is now worth approximately $3 million. The beams came from an old aerial tramway the brothers tore down. Those were heady times, what with the view, the skiing and the nightlife. Kidd and several of Sabich's contemporaries downplay his widespread reputation as a partier, but his brother doesn't. \"Spider smoke, drank and did whatever all of us did,\" he said. \"Let's not forget, those were the '60s and '70s. But I also remember grabbing a bunch of poles and setting up courses when there wasn't anyone else on the mountain at Snowmass. He'd do his 25 runs. A lot of people who'd see Spider out partying didn't see him doing those 25 runs. He was serious about his training.\"\n\nSabichs memory lives in a framed display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Aspen. There is also a Spider Sabich Ski Racing Arena on Snowmass Mountain. Tragedy struck the Sabich family again in 1988, when Mary died of brain cancer. She was a doctor, just 45 years old. She is buried next to her brother in Placerville, Calif. \"I don't know how my parents have handled it,\" Steve Sabich said. \"The only thing we can do is take the positive, high road and make sure Spider is remembered for his accomplishments rather than as a victim. He was no victim. He was a very strong guy.\"\n\nSABOLIC, IVAN Physician-Professor\n\nIvan Sabolic is a physician and research fellow, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; married to Branka with two daughters. Born January 15, 1950 in Kljud, Croatia. Education includes University of Zagreb School of Medicine 1973, M. Sc 1976 and DSc 1980 at University of Zagreb, Croatia.

Member of Croatian Biochemical Society; The New York Academy of Sciences; American Physiological Society.\n\nSABOLIC, CHARLES Tamburitza Hall of Fame\n\nCharles \"Chuck\" Sabolic was born December 29, 1925, in Conway, Pennsylvania, the younger of two sons of Paul and Evica Sabolic. Evica, nee Jambrisak, was a native of Berek (Bjelovar); Paul emigrated from Kostanjevac (Bjelovar) to Conway where he was a boilermaker for the railroad. At age 9, Chuck was given is first musical instrument, a banjo. He immediately took to music and performance. Soon he was studying tamburitza, first with Paul Perman, then with Steve Pandak. Chuck played brac in a piano trio at Pandak's tavern in Conway. At the same time he became interested in the musical styles of the \"old-timer\" tamburashi in and around Aliquippa, Pa., joining them in frequent jam sessions. Eventually he joined their orchestras. Some of the big influences on Chuck's career were Jim Novosel, John Habazin, Matt Prigorac, \"Big Vinko\"and \"Curly\" Celich. Frank Topak, TAA Hall-of-Famer and organizer of the famed Balkan Mountain Men, was Chuck's uncle and another mentor. He always placed high value on the experience of the unsung heroes of tamburitza music in America: that first generation of players. War and a tour of duty with the U.S. Navy intervened. After leaving the service in 1946, Chuck wasted no time in resuming his tamburitza career, playing with the Happy Balkans. Now, though, he was showing that sharp memory for melodies and lyrics and the flair for showmanship that were to become his calling card. He organized the Biser Tamburitza Orchestra in 1947 (and still leads Biser today). The original members of Biser were Chuck, on brac; Pete Carevich, brac; Tony Luketich, bass, and Steve \"Lefty\" Cvetican, on bugarija who remained Chuck's associate in Biser until his death in 1976. Other outstanding tamburashi who, over the years, have been members of the Biser Tamburitza Orchestra are Joe Matasic (Hall of Fame , Tony, Lou, and Steve Markulin, Julius Peskan, Nick Chavlovich, John Saban, Lex Ellesin, Pio Adamovich, George Rudar and Matt Rebrovic. Biser entertained throughout the U.S. and Canada, at various functions on the radio and television. The orchestra has made excellent recordings of tamburitza music, including the Biser theme song, \"Za Tvoje Plave Oci,\" Chuck's original composition. This song also became the theme song for The Tamburitza Hour radio program, a weekly show hosted by Chuck's brother, Ed Sabolic. Chuck and Biser relocated in Los Angeles in 1959. The group was an immediate hit, they were the most sought-after tamburitza group in the West. For the last dozen years Lex Ellesin and Chuck have teamed to keep Biser going strong in California and Nevada. Chuck an active promoter of tamburitza music, is a natural leader, as evidence by his many years ot service to his Croatian Fraternal Union lodge and the Croatian National Association of Southern California. He has been a visible forcein the TAA, co-chairing the 1974 Tamburitza Extravaganza in Los Angeles, coordinating the 1976 Las Vegas Extravaganza, and again as vice chairman of this year's Las Vegas event. Chuck is on the TAA Board of Directors. Chuck has the desire to help others grow and prosper and has encouraged the development of a younger generation of tamburitza musicians in Los Angeles. Chuck has been playing tambura 53 years, and plans to play \"as long as the Good Lord gives me strength.\" He has been blessed with the love and support of Nettie, his wife of 42 years, and his sons and grandchild. Last November Chuck retired, and he and Nettie moved to Las Vegas. Retired? Look for Chuck to organize a seniors' tamburitza orchestra here in the Nevada desert!\n\nSADKOVICH, JAMES J. Consultant-Professor-Author\n\nWhat do a professor, intelligence analyst, guitar teacher and consultant for the Croatian Information Agency have in common? They all fuse into one man: James J. Sadkovich. James Sadkovich was raised in the United States during the Cold War \"a bad time to be a Slav in the US,\" he says. As a boy, Mr. Sadkovich attended St, Augustine's, one of Milwaukee's Croatian parishes, and completed most of his elementary school there. While he considers himself American, \"with a bit of Croatian,\" he made an effort to discover his culture and roots. The pressure to be American was greater than any ties to what my older relatives referred to as 'the old country,\"' he says. However, the desire to learn about his history sent him on a journey of discovery. He taught himself to speak Croatian, learned to dance Croatian folk dances and traveled to his homeland. He became an expert on the region and was a consultant for the Croatian Information Agency, Intelligence analyst in, 1983, for Yugoslavia and East Germany and most recently, an expert consultant on Croatia and the Former Yugoslavia. He has spent most of his life teaching people about the ghosts, errors and successes of the past more commonly known as history. However, in 1991 he gave up his tenure, something he calls \"the kiss of death in academics\" and decided to pursue other goals and dreams, which include playing guitar, manual labor, part-time teaching and going back to school to earn-- a degree in Mass Communication-even though he has a Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Mr. Sadkovich's wrote an intriguing 1998 book The US Media and Yugoslavia, 1991-1995. James Sadkovich was a professor, University of Southern Mississipi, Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Born May 10, 1945 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Parents were from from Vele Mune in Istria and Staro Petrovo Selo in Slavonia. Educated in history, University of Wisconsin 1982. Published Italian Support for Croatian Separatism, 1927-1937 (1987); The Italian Navy in World War 11 (1993); The Use of Political Trials to Repress Croatian Dissent, 1929-1934 (\"Journal of Croatian Studies\", 1987-1988); Terrorism in Croatia, 1929-1934 (\"East European Quarterly', 1988); Serbian Hegemony Revisited (Journal of Croatian Studies, 1990-1993. Member of American Historical Association; Association for Croatian Studies; Croatian Academy of America; Society for Italian Historical Studies.\n\nSAICH, ANTON Ranch\n\nBorn October 11, 1863, he is a native of Golubinica, Dalmatia, the son of Anton and Mary (Anticevich) Saich. The family consisted of three children, John, Peter, and Anton, the subject of this sketch. In July, 1889, he came to Philadelphia and immediately came to California. He worked in San Francisco in the hotel business for one year, but that kind of work was not to his liking. For about one year he worked on ranches near Watsonville and Capitola; then came to Santa Clara County and settled near Cupertino, working for wages for a time; then in 1900 he bought twenty-two and a half acres all set to prunes, on the Stevens Creek Road. From time to time he has purchased additional acreage until he now owns 110 acres of fine orchard, set to prunes, peaches, apricots, cherries, and grapes. His ranch is well equipped with wells for irrigating and the water is piped to all parts of the ranch. He has rebuilt his house and farm buildings and all are now in fine shape. he has pulled out and reset about forty-five acres, so it is now one off the valuable orchards in the district. For many years Mr. Saich was engaged in buying and drying fruit, which he sold to packers, while he was also engaged in shipping cherries to the eastern market. Mr. Saich was first married in Santa Clara in 1901, being united with Miss Annie Kucer, a daughter of Steve and Kate (Kristicevich) Kucer; the father, a contractor and builder in Dalmatia, was accidentally killed by a fall while working on a building. He was born near Mr. Saichs native place and came to Santa Clara with her brother. Their union, however, was broken by her passing August 5, 1902, leaving him her infant son, born thirty-five days before his bereavement, whom they named Anton, Jr., and whom the father tenderly cared for and reared, and he is now his fathers right-hand man and able assistant in his horticultural enterprise. Mr. Saich some time afterwards married a second time, to Miss Teresa Brajenvich, who was born in the same vicinity as her husband, a daughter of John and Frances Brajenvich, the father being a farmer in his native Dalmatia. By his second marriage Mr. Saich has four children, Mary, Frances, Anna and John, all under the parental roof, dutiful and obedient children, a credit to their parents.\n\nSAKIC, JOE Hockey-Olympics\n\nJoe Sakic Forward for the Colorado Avalanche Hockey Team. After arriving in Canada from their native Croatia, Marijan and Slavica Sakic settled in Burnaby, Canada (Vancouver suburb), where their son was born and he soon found himself being dropped off at the local rink. Little Joe was shy, painfully so, because Croatian was the language of his home and he initially struggled with English. But on the ice, he was a star from the start, developing the startlingly sneaky and devastating wrist shot and one-timer that bedevils National Hockey League goalies years later\" Joe Sakic, captain of the Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche, is the winner of the Lester B. Pearson Award, given to the MVP of the regular season based on voting by NHL players in 2001. Sakic beat out Pittsburgh Penguins stars Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr for the award presented each year by the NHL Players' Association. \"This is the biggest honor any player could have,\" Sakic said Thursday. \"To be voted by all the players, to get the respect from them is something I'll never forget.\" Sakic also was a finalist for the Hart (Most Valuable Player) and Lady Byng (sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct) trophies and the Selke Award (top defensive forward), to be awarded Thursday night. He is the first player in 10 years to be a finalist for all three awards. Jagr amassed 121 points, including 52 goals, to win the scoring title for the fourth year in a row. Sakic was second with 118 points, including 54 goals. Lemieux, who came out of retirement in late December, had 76 points, including 35 goals in only 43 games. Sakic also led all playoff scorers with 13 goals and 13 assists.\n\nJoe Sakic scored the game-winning goal in the Gold Medal game playing for Team Canada in the Olympic Ice Hockey tournament of 2002. He is the all-time franchise leader for the Colorado Avalanche in goals, assists and points; and has been an NHL All-Star 9 times! Not to mention that he is one of the nicest professional athletes anywhere, and one that he is both aware and proud of his Croatian origin.\n\nSALAMUNOVICH, PETER Fisherman\n\nSalamunovich born in 1896 came to the United States in 1911, during the high tide of Croatian immigration. A fisherman, he worked off the Southern California coast before settling in Avalon, Santa Catalina Island in 1928, where he continued pursuing the occupation he had learned as a young boy off the Island of Brac, Dalmatia.\n\nSALATICH, P. B. Doctor-Oysterman-Professor\n\nDr. P. B. Salatich was born in New Orleans June 26, 1880. As a young man he always liked doctors and medicine, and it was not as surprise when he enrolled in Medical University, although that didn't stop him from cultivating oysters for several years and he worked day time as a bookkeeper and studied at night. He enrolled in Tulane University and graduated in 1905. He married Gladys Walter, an American, in 1907. They had five sons and two daughters. His oldest son, Peter Jr. is the student at Loyola University. two sons are in High school and other children are in Grammar School. For many years he was a professor of medicine at Tulane University. He was a member of the American College of Surgeons, American Medical Association, New Orleans Country Club and member of the Slavonian Society. He is well known surgeon throughout the South. He discovered \"The Interpretation of Pain in the Lower Lumbar Region\". He was the Slavonian. Society Physician and close friend to all members and fisherman in New Orleans. His father came from Dubrovnik, Croatia in 1870. He was a member and Secretary of Slavonian Society.\n\nSALLE, ANTON Businessman\n\nAnton Salle was the son of the late Dora and Marko Salle, both of the Island of Korcula, Dalmatia, Croatia.. He is survived by a sister Bena Bowles. He was 73 years of age in 1988. He is also survived by his son, Steve; daughter-in-law, Pat; daughter, Doreen and son-in-law, Bob Knabe.

Anton was a member of the Automotive Painters Union Local 1176 of Oakland and a member of former Croatian Fraternal Union bowling teams and tournaments in California. He has been a member of Tomislav Lodge 121 of Oakland ever since he married his wife, Eva Knezovich, in 1942- 46 years ago.\n\nSAMBRAILO, CHARLES P. Farm-Cattle-Paper Products-Gold Mine\n\nThe subject was a successful farmer and rancher, a cattle raiser, and he was a leading business man of the area around Watsonville as supplier of cartons and paper products to the many growers and ranchers in this Section. Charles Peter Sambrailo was born in Dalmatia on August 19, 1901 , the son of Peter and Stane (Milloglav) Sambrailo, both natives of Dalmatia. His father had come to California years earlier and owned a gold mine at Angel's Camp in 1878. The subject's father, Peter Sambrailo, filed for citizenship in Amador County. Charles P. Sambrailo came to this country as a young boy, settling with his parents in Watsonville in 1911. Peter Sambrailo began growing and shipping fruits and farm crops, and this was the life his son knew as a growing boy. He helped his father at times, and grew accustomed to the life of farmer and rancher. He attended the public schools of Watsonville, after which he entered his father's business. Since 1923 Mr. Sambrailo, had been involved in fruit, especially apples, and raising cattle. He had become one of the better known farmers and ranchers of the area, where he was president of Charles Sambrailo and Sons Ranches. This operation, which now includes his two sons, had grown steadily from the original acres to a large establishment that contains farm land, orchards, and cattle pastures. Mr. Sambrailo was also president of CharIes Sambrailo Paper Company, a firm which supplies the growers and farmers with containers for packing and shipping. Though president and manager of these businesses, Mr. Sambrailo had entrusted much of the responsibility to his two sons. Mr. Sambrailo was a member of the Pajaro Valley Chamber of Commerce and of the local lodge of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. His faith was Catholic. Mr. Sambrailo had been married twice. His first marriage to the former Henrietta King ended in her death in 1944, twenty years after the ccremony which joined them together. In 1946 Mr. Sambrailo, was married to Ruth Brandl, daughter of Fred and Rose Brandl. The subject was the father of two sons: Charles is married to Joan Kelley and William K. is married to Nancy Bentley and their children are Mark, Judy, and Michael Sambrailo. Both the sons reside nearby in Watsonville and the surrounding countryside, and both were affiliated with their father in business as executives of the firm of Charles Sambrailo and Company. Mr. Sambrailo passed away on December 3, 1963, and the two brothers have taken over active management of the corporation and ranch partnership.\n\nSAMBRAILO, PETER Farm-Cattle-Paper Products-Gold Mine\n\nCharles Peter Sambrailo was the son of Dalmatian parents who came to the new world to seek a new life, settling in Amador County where the elder Sambrailo worked in gold mines. The subject was a successful farmer and rancher, a cattle raiser, and he was a leading business man of the area around Watsonville as supplier of cartons and paper products to the many growers and ranchers in this Section. Charles Peter Sambrailo was born in Dalmatia on August 19, 1901, the son of Peter and Stane (Milloglav) Sambrailo, both natives of Dalmatia.

He was a physician for twelve Croatian societies in Los Angeles. He married Ana Skurich, the daughter of one of the most eminent Croatian pioneers in Watsonville, Mr. Stjepan Skurich.\n\nSANJEK, ROGER Professor-Author\n\nRoger Sanjek, a third-generation American of Croatian and Irish descent, has inade a substantial contribution to our understanding of interethnic and interracial relations in the United States. His most recent work, The Future of Us All: Race and Neighborhood Politics in New York City has thus far appeared in a hard cover and paperback edition. More importantly, the book, which studies interethnic relations in Elmhurst and Corona, Queens, has received critical acclaim among scholars and the general public. Sanjeks success should come as no surprise when one keeps in mind that the professor of anthropology at Queens College has published numerous works before, including Fieldnotes: The Makings of Anthropology, which, in its fourth printing, has become a standard textbook in colleges and universities throughout the United States. At a recent dinner at Astoria's Rudar Club, Sanjek explained that his Croatian background really gave him no particular insights into his anthropological work. \"I was basically a kid who grew up in New York in the '50s. In line with the times., I viewed myself as a product of the New York melting pot. \" Sanjek traces his Croatian roots to Varazdin, where his grandfather, Louis, attended gymnasium before studying at Zagreb University. Though he initially intended to be a Roman Catholic priest, Louis left the Church upon his arrival in the United States prior to World War I and became a Lutheran ininister, the only known Croatian Protestant cleric in America. He served in, among other places, Astoria, Queens, and wrote two self-published books in which he provided many details about his Croatian background. Elmhurst and Corona are for Sanjek a paradigm, an example of where we are going as a nation and as a city. In the 1960s, Ehnhurst and Corona had been almost entirely white. Within twenty years, the ethnic and racial composition of both neighborhoods radically changed. The change reflected those seen throughout New York City. Sanjek did not deal directly with issues which affect Croatian immigrants. today. However, his work does provide lessons that Croatian community leaders in neighborhoods where they are con centrated, such as Astoria, should keep in mind. The most important appears to be that immigrant communities must reach out to each other. in order to collectively defend their interests. Our Croatian community has failed, thus far, to do this. Though- Astoria is certainly considered by most Croatian New Yorkers to be one of the main centers of Croatian immigrant life in the City, we have yet to see any systematic attempts to reach out to the Greek, Italian, Brazilian, Bosnian Muslimand other major ethnic groups in the community. Our failure to do so could be seen in the last election. As far as this author is aware, no political candidate for any city or state-wide office based in Astoria made any attempt, to even recognize the existence of our community. We are being effectively ignored by those people who make decisions which affect all of us., Sanjeks workshows that in such an ethnically diverse area such as Astoria it would be difficult for Croatian Americans to make their voice heard on their own. They need, to forge alliances in order to do so.\n\nSANKO, SLAVKO Teacher\n\nInstructor in French and Russian at John Carroll University, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

He graduated from the School of Applied Arts in Split in 1958 and from the Academy of Fine Arts, Department of Sculpture in Zagreb he studied under Krsto Hegedusic, Grga Antunac, Valerije Michieli in 1971. In 1972 he moved to Canada and settled in Toronto where he still lives and works'as a professional artist. Already as a student Sardelic mounted one-man exhibitions. He worked on reliefs and mosaics for public places. He travelled abroad to study. Initially he leaned towards sculpture in stone, wood and bronze, as well as large mosaics. Vitality of movements, in sculpture and dynamism of colour in painting were characteristic of this period.\n\nOn arrival in Canada Sardelic's palette propelled in the direction of new surroundings, new inspirations, using acrylics in which the harmony of organic geometry and mythological symbolism first appeared. Similar development occurred in his sculpture. In 1976 Sardelic worked on murals. He experimented with new materials in graphics and painting, discovering individual technical means for his artistic expression. The presence of erotic forms in a vivid polyphony of colours marked the passionate experiences of the new environment and time, thus becoming the focal point of the cosmography of his perception. Since 1978, Sardelic has often spent time in the United States, Mexico, Columbia, and Venezuela, where he came into contact with the ancient cultures of North and South America. This experience reflected on his work's search for new growth in the form of evolving expressiveness by capturing and arousing global co-existence in a happy union of man's primordial intuitions and the flow of the universal energy of life. Sardelic has been exhibiting continually since 1969 in museums and galleries throughout the world, including Canada, United States, Mexico, Columbia, Venezuela, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Slovenia, Belgium, Japan, Korea, Germany, Croatia, and Australia, by participating in many international exhibitions a biennials where he received numerous awards and honours. To date he had 37 one-man exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Mexico City, Caracas, Bogota, Ottawa, Hamilton, (Canada), Toronto,' Frankfurt, Windsor (Canada), Zagreb, Sarajevo, Dubrovnik and Hamburg, and he participated in over 150 exhibitions. With the support of the Canada Council and the National Museums of Canada he mounted a large oneman exhibition in the Art Gallery of Hamilton. In 1987 he participated in 11 international exhibitions and biennials. With the sponsorship of the Government of Canada he put on a comprehensive one-man travelling exhibition in 1988 in the museums and galleries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1989 he was chosen Artist of the Year by the Canadian-Croatian Artists Society in Toronto. He also executed a large mosaic commissioned by a private collector. In 1994 he spent a short period of time in Australia. In 1995 the Government of the Republic of Croatia awarded him the order of the Croatian Danica for outstanding merits in the field of culture. Ante Sardelic is a member of various artist societies throughout the world. He is included in numerous i n t e r n a t i o n a I publications and \"Who's Whos.\" He has been writing poetry since his student days. The last five years of his artistic endeavour have been dedicated to the project The Eternal Homeland (Vjedna Domovina) and to providing aid for Croatia. His work can be found in galleries, museums, and private collections the world over. The following are several reviews of Sardelic's Eternal Homeland project: \"Through its poems and graphics the Eternal Homeland - of Ante Sardelic is a continuation and at the same time a summation of his artistic endeavour to date. Sardelic's \"Mediterranean spirit\" signifies a veritable awakening of colours and symbols, and in this artistic ' actualization there is obviously a growing emphasis on national themes: the coat of arms as the sum of Croatian fate, the triple braid as a sign of national constancy and homogeneity, and the three different scripts-the Glagolitic, the old Croatian Cyrillic and the Latin -- are used as an external mark of Croatian polyphony. Through his expression and his form Sardelic reaches for the very depths of the Croatian being, for the true source of our existence. His invocations \"de profundis\" and his jubilations \"in excelsis\" come to fruition here. He expresses his expectation and his welcome to Croatia reborn...\"\n\nSARDELICH, PETER Production Manager\n\nSardelich, born in 1935 in Smokvice on the Adriatic Island of Korcula, completed Electechnical education in Split (Dalmatia). He began in the United States as a baker, then a janitor in the fishing industry. He studied TV at Columbia College of Los Angeles in 1967 and later became production manager of NBC Studios in Burbank, California.\n\nSARICH CLAN Fishermen-Millworker\n\nThe Sarich family is one of the original Croatian families to settle in the Northwest comer of Washington State. Their family history in America started when a young man, Mike Sarich left his native Croatia to make a better life in this country. Where exactly he came from we're not sure. In later years he told people he was from the town of Omis (a small coastal town right outside of Split), but on documents he always wrote that he was from Nova Sela.\n\nWhat is known is that before he left the old country, he passed through the island of Vis and spotted a young girl, Lucri Karuza, whom he would remember for several years. When he came to the United States, Mike settled in the Northwest, where he worked in many of the lumber mills - finally ending up in the small mill-town of Clear Lake, Washington, which is just south of the present town of Sedro Woolley.\n\nAfter several years of working in the country and saving his money, he sent back to the old country for a bride to join him. The young girl, Lucri Karuza, whom he had seen in Vis was now 19 years old and agreed to come to America to marry him. At this time (1913), conditions in Vis were very poor with poverty and hard times. There was also a threat of war in the area, and all the young men were being drafted for several years of service in the Austrian Army. It still must have been difficult for a teen-age girl to leave her family and travel halfway around the world to marry a 33 year-old man she hardly knew. When Lucri came to this country, she was accompanied by her older brother, Nick Karuza. Nick's intention was just to come to the United States for a few years, save some money, and then go back to Vis.\n\nLucri and Nick sailed from Trieste to New York, and then rode across the country on the train to Bellingham, Washington where other men from Vis had already started to settle. In later life, Lucri would tell of the excitement of sailing into New York and seeing the Statue of Liberty. Nick would tell the story of how nervous he was passing through Ellis Island. He did not have all the proper papers for leaving Austria so was traveling with the passport of someone several inches taller than he was, but he made it through Ellis Island! Neither one of them could speak any English, but someone in their party knew the words \"hot dog\", so they were able to buy food to eat on the cross-country train trip.\n\nLucri and Nick's parents, Pavao and Margarita Luksic Karuza, were a fishing family in Vis. In fact the oldest child, Nick, was born in a row boat when the young married couple was out on a fishing trip. Of the ten children born to Pavao and Margarita Karuza in Vis, the oldest three (Nick, Yerka and Lucri) all came to the US. Five had died in childhood, and the two remaining both died as young adults during the flu epidemic in Vis of 1923 and 1924. It must have been very sad for the parents left in Vis to have their only three remaining children living overseas.\n\nWhen Nick and Lucri arrived in Bellingham, they were met by her husband-to-be, Mike Sarich. Mike wanted to get married that same day, but Lucri insisted that she have some time to rest up and get used to a new country before they got married. So they ended up waiting a week at which time they were married in the church of the Assumption, which was then located on North Elk (now State) Street. This was before Sacred Heart was established in South Bellingham. After the wedding, the Sarich newlyweds settled in Clear Lake where Mike worked in the lumber mill. They lived in \"downtown\" Clear Lake, about two blocks from the mill. Lucri soon discovered that she would have to learn English so she could even buy groceries at the only grocery store in town. She also taught herself how to read and write, as well as took care of other Croatian boarders that were living with them. During this time in Clear Lake, both of their sons were bom. The first boy was named John after the paternal grandfather (Ivan Saric), and the second boy was named Paul after the maternal grandfather (Pavao Karuza).\n\nAround 1920, the Clear Lake lumber mill burned. Mike was out of a job so the family had.. to move somewhere. They chose to move to South Bellingham, where Lucri had many ffiends who had moved from Vis. Mike worked for many of the lumber mills in Bellingham, including many years for the mill which was located at the bottom of the IOth Street Hill, just north of Harris. (This is the site that would later become the Uniflite plant). He eventually retired from the City of Bellingham Water Department.\n\nWhen the family moved to Bellingham, they settled at the comer of I I th and Easton, where they owned an old four-plex. They rented units out to many other families, mainly Croatians, for $10 per month. In the mid-thirties, these old apartments were tom down and the existing house at 622 1 Ith was built.\n\nSince they lived near the mill, one of Mike's extra jobs was to take care of the horses at the Mill on Sundays and other off days. He also took advantage of living near the water and supplied all the wood for heating their house and cooking by carrying driftwood on his back from Easton's Beach.\n\nMeanwhile, Lucri's brother and sister also became established in this country. Her brother Nick Karuza, who had immigrated with her, saw his plans of returning to Vis delayed when he fell in love and married a Bellingham girl, Vinka Ku1jis. He fished for many years out of Washington, Alaska, and California - living for most of that time in San Pedro. He did eventually realize his dream and moved back to Vis after his wife died, when he was in his 70's. He spent the last years of his life in Vis, living in the old family home which he had inherited.\n\nNick and Lucri's sister, Yerka had married John Lasich. They lived in Clifton and Astoria, Oregon, where John fished in the Columbia River. After John died, she married his brother, Tony Lasich, who also was a Columbia River Fisherman.\n\nSo, even though Mike Sarich was not a fisherman, the family still had a fishing heritage. Like most of the young South-side Croatian boys of the time, John and Paul Sarich both went to Lowell School, graduated from Fairhaven High School, and worked on fishing boats. For many years they both had their own purse seiners, John the Indiana and Paul the Marene. (Sleasman 1999)\n\nSARIC, DARLENE A.

In 1989, the business moved into its current custom-built facility at Joseph Lloyd Parkway.\n\nSARICH, JOHN Chef-Restaurant-TV Cooking & Wine-Writer\n\nFew chefs enjoy access to a greater bounty of world-class wines and fresh foods than John Sarich. Its incredibly exciting to live in the Pacific Northwest, says John. Not only do we have an outstanding variety of ingredients from the land and sea, we also have exceptional wines from the Columbia Valley, where long summer days and crisp autumn nights produce ideal conditions for well balanced wines. John joined Washingtons Chateau Ste Michele Winery in 1976, and his enthusiasm and knowledge of the wines and food of the area is unsurpassed. He conducts cooking classes, wine and food tastings, wine dinners and special events throughout the US and internationally. He also presents training seminars and classes for wine and food professionals and aficionados around the world. In 1980, John left Chateau Ste Michele to pursue his dream of owning a restaurant. He founded Seattles acclaimed Adriatica Restaurant and later opened Dalmacija Ristoran in Seattle Pike Place Market. While at Adriatica, John was selected by Esquire magazine as one of the countrys hot new chefs and listed by The Seattle Times as one of the citys top five chefs. After returning to Chateau Ste Michelle as Culinary Director in 1990, John hosted the Emmy-nominated cooking show Taste of the Northwest for four years.

John is currently working on his new television series (Best of Taste  Flavors of the Pacific Coast) the companion cookbook for which was published in April 2001 by SeaHill Press. (Internet 2001)\n\nSARICH, JOSEPH Business-Military\n\nJoseph Steven Sarich, Jr. was born in Seattle, Washington on July 28, 1918; he died here March 10, 2001. Brother Joe was born into an intensely proud Croatian Fraternal Union family so it is small wonder that he, his twin brother John and younger brother Steve, Jr. were charter members of Nest 220 when it was formed here in 1923. The twins, Joe and John, remained in Seattle all their lives and were, together with their wives, regular fixtures at all of our social events. Joe was a veteran of World War 11, having served his country in the Signal Corps in the South Pacific. He and his wife Helen were married in 1947-a marriage that was to endure 53 years and bring forth son Joseph, Jr. and daughter Judy. Joe worked some as a bookkeeper and as a bus driver but he spent the better part of his working life with his brothers in the Puget Sound Salmon Egg enterprise. He was a member of the Magnolia Presbyterian Church in Seattle, where he served as an elder for many years. Brother Sarich is survived by his wife Helen, daughter Judy (James) Lacy, four grandchildren and his brothers John (Mary) Sarich and Steve (Kay) Sarich. He was preceded in death by his son Joseph Sarich, Jr.\n\nSARICH, PETER M. Grocery-Life Insurance\n\nPeter born 1919, in Lead, South Dakota made his living in the grocery and life insurance business. He later became a member of the Prudential Million Dollar club and the Prudential Underwriters Association of Long Beach. Sarich made his income by selling to people in America but he never forgot his cultural heritage, for he was a long time member of Croatian Fraternal Union, Lodge 177. He also served as president of Mary Star of the Sea High School PTA. Peter and his wife Toby had two daughers: Betty Schmitt of Mammoth Lakes, and Barbara Wallace of Hawaii, and one son, Victor of San Pedro. Peter passed away July 27, 1981.\n\nSATLOW CLAN\n\nThe three Satlow brothers from Dalmatia, Croatia came to the Harbor in Aberdeen, Washington the long way around. Anthony (wife, Anna Bussanich) the oldest one, left home when he was 14 and sailed around the world before landing in Port Townsend in 1897. He came to Aberdeen and worked in a saloon and also one at Grays Harbor City before moving to Tacoma to open a grocery store. In 1911 he returned to Hoquiam and started the Vienna Grocery which he operated until 1960 when he retired. In the meantime, Brother Matt also had gone to sea and finally found his way to Hoquiam where he joined Tony. Later he purchased a store and service station at Axford Prairie. Younger brother Sam followed his brothers footsteps and became a seafaring man. His travels took him to South Africa where he met and married Katherine Petersen. Six years and three children later, the family arrived at the Blagen mill dock aboard a lumber schooner. Sam opened the North End Pool Hall and Grocery store in Hoquiam which he operated for many years.\n\nSCOPINICH, PAUL Ship Yard\n\nFor more than a century the name \"Scopinich\" has been synonymous within the yachting community with craftsmanship, service, reliability and integrity. When we place the name \"Scopinich\" on our fighting chairs, it represents the pride and reputation on six generations of master shipbuilders. This famous name can be traced to a small island off the eastern shore of the Adriatic, Losinj Mali, Croatia where, from the mid-nineteenth century great grandfather Scopinich owned and operated the Scopinich Boat Works. In the early twentieth century great uncle Mirto Scopinich and grandfather Federico Scopinich migrated to the U.S. and kept this heritage of excellence flourishing at their two locations in Freeport, Long Island. Despite the Depression, hard work, dedication and skills learned in the old country gave Scopinich a reputation as the builder of the finest boats coming out of Long Islands many shipyards. In 1942 the two Scopinich yards were awarded the coveted U.S. Army and Navy \"E\" prize for excellence in war production. Federicos son, Mario, carried on this tradition of excellence at the Hampton Boat Works at Hampton Bays, Long Island. Today, Paul Scopinich, Marios eldest son, continues the family tradition by building the finest marine products in the world. A Scopinich product is a statement of excellence, a handcrafted masterpiece using only the finest materials. Its innovative design, superior ergonomics, sophisticated engineering and perfectly machined metal components, combined with the finest finish, make a Scopinich the barometer of excellence against which all others are judged. Scopinich Fighting Chairs and Accessories at Stuart, Florida is proud to present its complete line of world class fighting chairs, accessories and a range of sportfishing equipment that assures years of recreational and tournament satisfaction.\n\nSCORSUR, BENJAMIN Ranch-Silverminer\n\nFor many years Benjamin Scorsur has been prominently and successfully identified with the fruit industry in Santa Clara County and long experience has made him an authority on this line of work. He also ranks with the pioneer residents of this part of the state, having taken up his residence here in 1871. A native of Croatia, he was born in Dalmatia, in Dubrovnik, April 11, 1855, the fourth in the family of John Cathrinia Scorsur, the father a well-to-do farmer of Dalmatia. Although it was his parents desire that he devote his time to his studies, Benjamin Scorsur preferred hard manual labor to the routine of the schoolroom, and hearing many favorable reports concerning California, he decided to locate there, when fourteen years old he went to sea, receiving five dollars a month as pay; however, he followed the sea for five years, when he quit the sea to come to California, arriving in September, 1871. His elder brother, James Scorsur, had proceeded him to the United States, arriving in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1866. In 1871 the two brothers started for California, but first made their was to the mines of Virginia City, Nevada. Not meeting with success there, they packed all of their belongings, consisting of a few blankets and tools, and struck out for the Guadalupe mines in Santa Clara Valley. They divided tier time between mining and farming. preempting 163 acres of land adjoining the mines, which were at the time owned by and English company, and at this time Benjamin Scorsur became a citizen of the United States. For eight years the two brothers devoted their attention to mining, farming and stock raising, working laboriously to gain a start in life, but their efforts were fruitless, for through a dispute in the title the land once more became the property of the English Company by decision of the Santa Clara County courts. Possessing the dauntless spirit of youth, Mr. Scorsur courageously faced the future, and removing to San Jose, he entered business circles as a fruit buyer, dryer and shipper. From a modest beginning the enterprise grew to one of the large proportions and for thirty-five years he continued along those lines. He also became a prosperous horticultureist, purchasing a good ranch of twenty-three acres on the Doyle Road and a valuable cherry orchard on the San Francisco Highway. In 1918 following the close of the war, Mr. Scorsur bought a sixty-acre home ranch, is married, and has one child,. He is a veteran of the World War, serving only eleven months overseas as a member of the Ninety-First Division.

He has worked diligently and persistently, and success in substantial measure has crowned his labors, while at the same time his efforts have been an important factor in the development and improvement of Santa Clara County along horticultural lines.\n\nSCORSUR, JOHN Ranch\n\nA man who was highly esteemed for his splendid traits of character and the warm friendship he made was the late John Scorsur, who was born in Dalmatia, Croatia, in 1873, a son of James and Thomasine Scorsur. The father was a pioneer fruit man and a prominent and successful horticulturist, having an orchard on the Homestead Road. He died July, 6 1915, his wife surviving him until August 16, 1916. Of the Union of this worthy couple, two children were born, namely, Kate, Mrs. Felicich of San Jose, and John, the subject of this sketch, who came to the United States with his mother, joining his father, who was then residing at Guadalupe. Some years later the family moved to San Jose and here John attended the public schools, as well as the business college. He excelled in penmanship from the American Pen Art Hall. After his school days were over he assisted his father in the care of the orchard as well as the fruit business. In the fall of 1900 Mr. Scorsur made a trip back to his old home in Dalmatia, and there on February 9, 1901, he was married to Miss Annie Genovich, also a native of Dalmatia, the daughter of Peter and Mary Genovich, farmer-folk in that far-off country. He immediately returned to his home in San Jose with his bride, arriving in March, 1901, and they began housekeeping in the residence at 1398 East San Fernando Street, where Mrs. Scorsur still lives. John Scorsur was engaged in the fruit business with his father, looking after the orchards on the old homestead, and became a well-posted and progressive orchardist. He was in ill health several years before his death, which occurred April 6, 1915. He was a man of pleasing personality and had a host of friends, being a member of the Austrian Benevolent Society and St. Josephs Benevolent Society. The union of Mr. and Mrs. Scorsur was blessed with five children, Thomasine, Marie, Anna, James and Jennie, who all reside at home. They are members of St. Patricks Catholic Church.\n\nSCORSUR, NICK Ranch-Silverminer\n\nA good example of thrift and untiring energy is illustrated in the life of Nick Scorsur, now retired from active business life, and his years of toil have resulted in a competency that is justly deserved. Born in Dalmatia, Croatia, January 1, 1858, he is a son of John and Catherine (Cavaletta) Scorsur; his father was, for many years, in the stock and sheep business. Five sons and two daughters composed the family, of whom only two survive, the subject of this sketch and an older brother, Ben, who both lie in California. As early as 1875, two brothers, James and Benjamin, came to America, settling in Virginia; and late in 1880 he came to California by the way of the Isthmus of Panama and located in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley. In 1882 Nick Scorsur followed them and his continuously resided in this section since that time. The brothers invested in a 160-acre tract of land near the New Almaden mines, which they cleared and developed. When they were ready for planting, the owners of the mining property informed them that they had no right or title to the property and were successful in beating them out of their holdings, as well as others in the neighborhood. This occurred in 1885, but, undaunted, the three brothers located on a tract of land in East San Jose, where they started in the fruit business. Beginning at the bottom, by hard work and close application, they gradually enlarged their operations and increased their holdings; in 1892 however, they dissolved the partnership. James passed away in 1915. Meanwhile Nick Scorsur engaged in in fruit buying, handling cherries, peaches, and prunes with good success. He owned a forty-five-acre prune orchard on White Road, which he kept for about five years, when he sold it at a good profit. He owns a thirty-five-acre cherry and prune orchard at Campbell and also a twenty-acre orchard on Senter Road, which brings him a handsome income each year. In 1900 he invested in a tract of land in East San Jose, building a commodious residence at the corner of Twenty-sixth and San Antonio streets, still the family home. The marriage of Mr. Scorsur occurred in San Jose, April 4, 1889, and united him with Miss Ellen Talia, also a native of Dalmatia, who was born August 14, 1865, and who came to California in May, 1888. She is the daughter of Captain Matthew and Raphael Talia. Her father was a man of sterling integrity who followed a seafaring life as captain of private merchant vessels on the Mediterranean Sea. Mr. and Mrs. Scorsur are the parents of five children; John is manager of the ranches owned by the family; Matthew, deceased; Nicholas graduated in 1917 from the College of Commerce, University of California, with the degree of B.A.\n\nSCORSUR, STEVE Ranch-Restaurant\n\nA resident of California since 1887, Steve Scorsur was born in Dalmatia, Croatia, August 14, 1861. His father, John Scorsur, followed the sea for many years until he retired to his farm. He had married miss Mary Lopizich and they were blessed with six children- four boys and two girls- and two sons and two daughters and still living. One brother, John Scorsur, is a fruit buyer and lives on Pine Avenue, The Willows. The parents both passed away on the home farm in Dalmatia. The fourth child of the family, Steve Scorsur, grew up on the farm and as there were no public school advantages in those days did the best he could to pick up an education, though most of it was obtained in the great school of experience. When sixteen years old he went to sea, first in the Mediterranean trade, and then in the transatlantic, touching at Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Providence, and Galveston, Texas, his first trip to the United States being when he was nineteen years old, when he landed in Philadelphia. He continued his seafaring life until 1887, when he came to Galveston on a three-masted schooner, Martin L. Smith, and there he left ship and came to San Jose, California, where he had uncles and cousins living. He found employment in the fruit business, working for James Scorsur, but soon went to Los Angeles, where he was employed for two years. Thence he removed to Madera, where he became proprietor of a restaurant, being in business there when Madera County was organized, and was a warm friend of Judge Connelly. After eight years in Madera, Mr. Scorsur sold out his interests there and returned to San Jose, purchasing his present place of one acre on San Antonio Street, where he erected a residence, built a dryer and engaged in buying and selling fruit, in which he has been very successful. He also owns a ranch on Foxworthy Road, where he is engaged in raising prunes and apricots. Mr. Scorsurs marriage took place in San Jose, March 12, 1901, uniting him with Miss Mary Genovich, who was born in Dalmatia, and came to America that same year. Their union has been blessed with five children: John, a graduate of Healds Business College, is now a bookkeeper in the Bank of Italy at San Jose; Mary was educated in the San Jose high school and Healds Business College and assists her mother in presiding over the home; Peter, Stephen and Anthony are attending the grammar school. Mr. Scorsur is a member and former vice-president of the Austrian Benevolent Society of San Jose. The family are members of St. Patricks Catholic Church and take a generous part in its benevolence.\n\nSCOTLAND, ARTHUR G, (DOMICH) Judge\n\nJustice Scotland was first appointed to the Superior Court in Sacramento County by Goverernor George Deukmajian in April 1987, and was elevated by Governor Deukmajian to the Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District in January 1989.

Mr. Scurichs parents were Peter Antone and Mary (Sanbrailo) Scurich. His father acquired orchard land in the Watsonville area, and devoted his atteniton primarily to raising apples. After attending local public schools, Anthony P. Scurich, at about the age of fifteen, joined his father in growing, packing, and shipping apples. Following the fathers death in 1956, he became responsible for the managment of the orchards and other holdings on seventy acres near Watsonville.

In 1883 he crossed the Atlantic, but did not remain in the eastern section of the United States, making the long journey across the continent to the Pacific coast. He entered the employ of the Southern Pacific Railroad, working first as a section hand in Redding, California, but in 1888, he came to Watsonville. He embarked in the fruit packaging and shipping business, forming a partnership with Nick Banac and theirs was one of the first firms of that kind in the valley. Subsequently he was joined by his brother, Stephen Scurich, who had come to the Golden state when sixteen years of age, and they became the owners of a ranch of one hundred acres in Green valley, on which they planted an apple orchard. By scientific methods and concentrated effort they brought the farm to a high state of development and afterward sold the place, making a large profit on the investment. When he came here there were apple orchards on Main street, in what is now the business section of the city. In 1898 he organized the Austrian-American Benevolent Society of the Pajaro valley, which has become a strong and prosperous organization, having the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars in its treasury. At San Francisco, California, in 1893, Mr. Scurich married Mess Mary Vlahutin, also a native of Dalmatia. Antone L.

Packing Shipping Farm\n\nFollowing in his fathers footsteps as a leading California grower and shipper of apples, Stephen Scurich, Jr. continues to send his distincitve peoducts to all parts of the nation and Europe. Scurichs Pajaro Valley fruit is famous among connoisseurs, and the firm has won countelss awards for its products in state and coutny fairs. Valley Rose apples were developed by the elder Stephen Scurich, Sr., and his son his introduced many innovations into the growing, care, and shipping of famed varieties of fruit produced in orchards around Watsonville. Stephen Scurich, Jr., often called Bob, was born in Watsonville, on August 9, 1908, the son of Stephen and Lucie (Zar) Scurich. His father was born in 1868 in Dalmatia, Croatia. He came to this country at the age of sixteen, settling in Watsonville and working hard in fields and packing houses to earn money to send for his brothers and sisters. Stephen Scurichs wife, the former Lucie Zar, came to New Orleans, Louisiana. The elder Stephen Scurich and his brother Luke entered the orchard business as soon as they could lease land for fruit growing. It was not long before they attained success and became the largest packers of fruit in central California. They annually sent hundreds of carloads of apples to Europe, where Pajaro Valley fruit had become an item in high demand. Many times Gold Medal winner for his Bellflower and Sebastopol apples, he invested in such Watsonville property as the Central Hotel. The first in his area to pack apples in colored polyethelene bags, he was also the first to use seasonal packaging at Christmas time.

Seput of Hillsborough, and two daughters, Elizabeth Zibilish of Mill Valley and Evelyn Friend of San Diego. There are eight grandchildren.\n\nSERKA, PAUL Fisherman-Engineer\n\nPaul Serka was, on every count, a remarkable fisherman. Born in Sumartin, Island of Brac, Dalmatia, Croatia he pulled up his roots at the age of twenty-three. With the help of his brother, Nick, who was fishing with Frank Novak, he came to Tacoma in 1913. Accompanying this future top fisherman were Tony Ancich and Nikola Babich. Serka, a tall, sensitive young man, arrived in Washington with a desire to practice his trade and fish the waters of Puget Sound, but \"chances\" were hard to find. He labored in the sawmills and laid streetcar track along the Point Defiance line to sustain himself. When the opportunity to fish did come, it was shortlived. In Gig Harbor he fished with Andrew Gilich, replacing one of the members of the crew who was ill. When the former crewman recovered, Serka returned to his former shore jobs. In Europe he had fished on a small scale for sardines, mackerel, and bottom fish. By the fall of 1913, he was fishing the West Passage for sockeye and humpies with Joe Martinac on the boat Traveler. When he moved to Gig Harbor a year later, he found himself to be in the company of superior fishermen who were also from Sumartin: Lee Makovich, the Skansie brothers, John Skansie (there were two unrelated Skansie families in Gig Harbor), Mike Katich, Pasco Dorotich, Spiro Babich, and Sam and John Borovich. Fishing was not a year-round venture. There were summer and fall fishing. The rest of the time was spent doing repair work and patching nets (260 fathoms). The shares on a boat were divided much as they had been in Europe: boat, two shares; each crew member, one share. The fishermen were allowed to fish every day but Sunday. This was called \"Sunday Law\", and they were fined if caught. A big catch was known as a \"big scratch\", and \"high boat\" designated the boat that had caught the most fish.\n\nBy 1915, a year after he became an engineer with one-quarter ownership in the boat St. Nicholas with Mike Katich, Andrew Gilich, and Skansie, at least 200 boats were fishing in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Competition was keen. There was much fish but no market for them. Fishermen were paid five cents apiece for loads of mixed humpy and sockeye. In many cases, the canneries turned away boatloads when they could use no more. Some fishermen, after having made set after set and having pulled nets by hand all day, found that no cannery would accept their catch at a fair price. Those fishermen who were continually \"high boat\" had no trouble with this because their catch was guaranteed by the cannery. \"High Boat\" made $2,000 in 1915, but many boats didn't even make expenses. Usually one-half of the crew was green, but all were eager and willing to learn. Serka sold the St. Nicholas and bought the boat Confidence with partners. Sam Kazulin repaired the boat in a Gig Harbor yard. Mike Katich became a partner in 1916 when together they purchased a sixty-foot boat. A boat of this size brought more comfort to the fishermen and held more fish in its hold. Until 1917, Serka fished locally and at the Salmon Banks in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but, in 1918, he ventured farther north to Alaska, where he fished for the Kanaka Packing Company along the Portland Canal which was one-half American, one-half Canadian as soon as you stepped into Alaska. A pilot was hired for two weeks to take the boat north, but, as they went, Serka watched the charts and learned navigation; he fished in Alaska for years without a mishap. When asked whether he was anxious when he took the boat underway himself, Serka looked surprised: \"Of course not!\" He had made up his mind that he would master his trade, and this he did. Katich and Serka sold their boat to Nick Bez, who converted it into a tender. He purchased a one-third share of the Emancipator when his brother decided to return to Europe in 1919. Paul Puratich was one of the owners. At that time, a boat and net could be had for $12,000. The Oceanic was designed by Martinac and built in the Skansie yards for Serka in 1920. It was powered by one of the first diesel engines on the Sound. Some of the crew members were Joe and Jerry Markota, John Jerkovich, and Tony Ancich. Serka skippered this boat for fourteen years.\n\nMaria Cvitanovic, a beautiful lady from Sumartin, and Paul Serka were married in 1924. Six years later, the Sun Rise Ranger was built for a planned Canadian venture, but no charters could be obtained, and, by 1932, Serka returned to Washington. Martinac was again retained to build another boat, the Oceania, in 1934. Tragedy struck this ill-fated seiner in 1948, when high swells caused water to fill its hold. All equipment and nets went under. The skipper and crew lost all their belongings but saved their lives. Vince Cvitanovich and Serka were partners in the Wisconsin in 1947. Cvitanovich served as a member of Serka's crew for many lucrative years. The Sea Master, one of the fastest purse seiners in the Sound, was built by the Kazulin yard in 1958. This master seiner was to be Serka's last command, for, in 1967, Serka left the life of the sea.\n\nWhen a man was consistently \"high boat\", others followed wherever he went or set his nets. \"When making a set, the other boat should let you get your skiff in position,\" Serka said. Some, in their hurry and desire to catch fish, neglected to do this. Paul Serka was always followed by others. He had fished many seasons, and this strong, quiet man knew the tides and how to spot a school of fish and how to work them both to his advantage. A glance at the evening sky told him how to prepare for tomorrow. Most of his life had been spent in contest with the elements, never in foolhardy risks, but with the sound judgement of what might be safely done under the prevailing temper of the wind and the seas. Fishing is not only knowing the tides, the navigation charts, and working with people, it is also taking a chance. Behind every rock or sand bar, every set, lay the chance of losing life, limb, boat, and net. It took great courage to brave the elements and gamble everything you had worked for. Some days were lucky. Serka knew many days of elation when he knew he was \"high boat\", but there were other days when many sets were made and the fish were not there. Paul Serka worked for the improvement of the fishing industry, and this gentleman of the sea will be remembered for his excellence with men, boats, and fish.\n\nSERTICH, JOHN Professor\n\nJohn Sertich was born on Feb. 22, 1927 in McGill, Nevada.\n\nHe graduated from Saint Marys College in California in 1950 and received his masters degree from the University of Laval, Quebec, Canada in 1955. He also attended Sacramento State College in Sacramento from 1964-1966. His specialty is Metaphysics and Social Philosphy. He speaks Croatian, French and German. He completed his thesis in 1955 on The Basis of Logical Opposition for an M.A. in Philosophy. He is an instructor of philosophy at American River College in Sacramento, California.\n\nSESICH, BOB Teacher\n\nSesich has just been selected as the outstanding teacher in his district by the 660 classroom instructors who serve alongside him. Thats a lot of praise, but it comes straight from his colleagues in the Freemont Union High School District.\n\nA onetime starting tackle on the University of New Mexico varsity football team, Sesich today still looks like a pretty tough customer. But his looks are tempered with a genuine understanding of the problems kids bring to Blaney. Sesich teaches social studies, but also takes on other faculty duties, including science and math, health safety, alcohol and drug abuse, and driver education. Thursday night he was honored by the San Jose Jaycees in their nationwide program of recognition for outstanding teachers.\n\nSesich is a graduate of Sunnyvale High and San Jose State, where he received his teaching credential and his masters degree. He was a football player at both schools and served as an assistant football coach at Sunnyvale High for four years.\n\nAged 32, he and his wife, Barbara live in Cupertino with their two children, Robbie, 5, and Laurie, 7.\n\nSESICH, EMILY Croatian Activist Tamburitza\n\nEmily was born in the Santa Clara Valley and was a long time resident of San Jose, and a 61 year member of the Croatian Fraternal Union. Her maiden name was Klicinovich. She was a dedicated fraternalist and a hard worker. Many a gallon of spaghetti gravy and pounds of pasta she helped prepare at various functions at Napredak Park, both the old hall and the new. Whenever there was a function all I had to say was, \"Emily, send out 50 or 100 flyers or letters to those that I have checked off on the lodge membership roster \" In a few days it was done. Emily would then be on the phone saying it was done and asking what else had to be done. She was the type that if you asked her to bring a cake, she would bring two or three.
