        "text": "Biography\n\nHere's the video for the new single, \"Sophia\".\n\nIndependent Country Recording Artist, Stephanie Quayle boldly declare she's \"living the dream,\" and She sure didn't get there by resting on her laurels or her looks.\n\nStephanie is not that type of woman.\n\nThe road to her latest project, \"Ain't No Housewife\", is paved with a surprising amount of life experience worn into this bold singer-songwriter's boots. From the slow burn of \"Promise You Won't Feel a Thing\" to the bold, boogie-woogie declaration \"Ain't No Housewife,\" Stephanie sounds as confident as she does earnest, paying respect to country elders while pushing the envelope of Americana music.\n\nStephanie's youth was spent in a dusty Montana barn, the hum of country music legends in the background. The muse came early at age 12 to this American beauty, though her earliest efforts at songwriting denied the inherent twang in her voice.\n\nEventually, at age 16 Stephanie embarked on a musical journey that found her fronting her first band in Switzerland, a long way from the Rocky Mountains she called home. Performing in Europe only furthered this musician's resolve: to chase down that musical dream and let nothing stand in her way. \"It was the moment I knew that this would be my life,\" she says.\n\nThe ride towards that dream wasn't always pretty but it was real. Stephanie returned to the United States, making her way through gravel roads, dive bars and the elusive star-making machinery to finally replant her roots in Los Angeles. Stephanie's dream chase could have been easier, but she decided instead to be an independent artist, a journey that led to the writing and recording of \"Ain't No Housewife\". \"It was no longer about what everyone else wanted me to do, or who to be, it was about what I wanted to create and how I wanted to tell my story and empower others.\"\n\nIn the Spring of 2009 Stephanie was invited to Maria Shriver's 2009 Women's Conference as a woman and agent of change. Maria was moved by Stephanie and wanted her to share her story and inspire others. Soon thereafter Stephanie returned to her hometown of Bozeman, MT to debut her sound and heart at the 2009 Hatch Film Festival. After a 10-year absence from the Montana music scene, Stephanie received an incredible homecoming and was recognized as the Groundbreaker Musician of the Year.\n\nThe inspiration from this event boosted her back to California to open the Women's Conference in front of thousands women!!! She will be back in 2010 too with her song about empowerment, \"Be Who You Are\".\n\nThe word was getting out and in January she and her band were off to The Sundance Film Festival to perform at the coveted Moving Pictures Magazine Event and the Gibson Guitar Lounge.\n\nShe quickly shifted gears from the buzz of Hollywood to be the Keynote for the 2010 Girls For A Change Conference. Speaking, performing and mentoring hundreds of girls from the State she grew up in was one of the most defining moments of Stephanie's career and life. It was more than the accolades; it was the art of paying it forward happening right before her eyes.\n\nPerforming throughout Los Angeles and getting the crossed arms to say, \"I don't like country, but I like this\" continued to fuel Stephanie into 2010. The momentum sent her on a whirlwind of performances around the country. Amidst all this, Stephanie and her creative friends shot her debut music video \"Sophia\".\n\nIn June, Stephanie was the first artist to perform at the College National Finals Rodeo and opened it with the National Anthem. She debuted her song, \"Rodeo Life\" and since then it has become the rodeo anthem for many of the athletes, both young and old. On her down time she visited the local recreation center and spent time singing and speaking to hundreds of kids, another truly defining moment for this emerging singer/songwriter.\n\nStephanie recently signed on as the spokesperson for Cowgirls Are Forever, a film project that includes education along with multi-platform branded experiences. The CAF project is the untold story of the American cowgirl, how her bold spirit has shaped the American landscape, and impacted contemporary culture in art, music, fashion, entertainment, conservation, business, ranching and rodeo. The mission of CAF reflects Stephanie's mission as well. CAF inspires women from all walks of life to connect with the can-do cowgirl spirit that lives inside. It is the perfect platform for Stephanie. She has a passion for empowering girls to become strong, bold, and independent women. She always says, \"Never give up.\"\n\nThis fall Stephanie is back in Montana to bring awareness to her community in support of the Belgrade school district. All schools are being hit hard by budget cuts and she is working with her community to put on a fundraising concert to keep music and sports alive. She will be going around Montana as an advocate to motivate kids to stand up for these vital elements of public education.\n\nStephanie will be hitting the road in October with her band down south and ending her year at the National Finals Rodeo.\n\nStephanie continues to express herself and what she stands for through her songs, videos and performances. Some of Nashville's finest have her music and the buzz continues to gain momentum. This rising star is doing it her way and going straight to her fans' hearts. Stephanie Quayle will seduce you with both her voice and her story, and maybe inspire you to kick up some dust and chase your own dream as well.\n\nhttp://www.stephaniequayle.com\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/stephaniequayle\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephanie-Quayle/6287419655?ref=ts\n\nhttp://twitter.com/stephaniequayle\n\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/aint-no-housewife/id335798591"
