        "text": "World records\n\nBritons who challenged themselves during lockdown saw their achievements recorded in the record books this week. Londoner Tinuke O’Yediran achieved the most cartwheels on roller skates in one minute – with a total of 30 – and the most spins on e-skates in one minute, with 70. Martin Rees, from Berkshire, performed the most magic tricks underwater in three minutes, achieving a total of 20.\n\nStephen Ellison\n\nThe diplomat was praised after he jumped into a river in China to rescue a drowning student. The British consul-general in Chongqing swam the young woman to safety after she slipped on rocks and fell into the water.\n\nManchester\n\nA modernist monolithic concrete pavilion known locally as The Wall in Piccadilly Gardens has been demolished after years of acrimonious campaigning, closing a chapter on one of Britain’s most maligned attempts at urban planning in recent years. The structure was designed by celebrated Japanese architect Tadao Ando, but was seen to enable anti-social behaviour from public urination to drug-dealing.\n\nTurnip Prize\n\nThere were a record 120 entries this year for the spoof award organised by a Somerset pub, which has announced its shortlist. The award is given annually to someone who has “created something that they perceive to be crap art using the least amount of effort.” The entries include a baby doll with its back to a plant called Back to the Fuchsia and a stone placed on a tomato, in tribute to the late comedian Bobby Ball and his catchphrase “Rock on Tommy”.\n\nDisco classics\n\nThe 1977 hit single Yes Sir, I Can Boogie by the Spanish duo Baccara has re-entered the charts after it was adopted as an unofficial anthem by Scotland’s football team as they celebrated beating Serbia to make it to the European Championships for the first time in 22 years.\n\nFabienne Quinn\n\nThe teenage special constable who volunteered more than 1,000 hours for Police Scotland, is now joining the force as a regular officer. The 19-year-old started her volunteer role at Paisley police station in April after being furloughed from her job as a lifeguard and completed 1,023 hours on shift.\n\nCaroline Lucas\n\nThe Green Party’s only MP has topped the Radio 4 Woman’s Hour Power List, which celebrates the positive contributions that women make to the environment and sustainability. The judges said that Lucas was able to explain scientific evidence in “clear and impactful terms” and described her as “fearless in holding power to account”.\n\nLewis Hamilton\n\nThe British racing driver won a seventh Formula One world championship, equalling Michael Schumacher’s all-time record. The 35-year-old’s victory in the Turkish Grand Prix in Istanbul took him to a record 94 wins.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThe singer-songwriter has helped to fund the production of the US firm Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine by donating $1m (£755,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Centre in Nashville, Tennessee. Results from the vaccine trials revealed that it may be 94.5 per cent effective in protecting people against Covid-19.\n\nAiden Stott\n\nThe lifelong Wrexham FC fan, who has cerebral palsy and was raising money to adapt his home, woke up to find the £6,000 he needed had been donated by the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Rob McElhenney, who is set to take over the club with his fellow actor Ryan Reynolds. The takeover could lead to £2m being invested in the club, which has been in fan ownership since 2011.\n\nCancer diagnosis\n\nJudit Giró Benet, a 23-year-old student from Tarragona in Spain, has been awarded this year’s James Dyson Award for a home-testing kit that detects breast cancer by analysing urine. The pain-free, non-invasive method could encourage greater numbers of women to test themselves, removing the need to travel to a GP surgery or hospital.\n\nBotany\n\nThe Millennium Seed Bank is celebrating its 20th anniversary, having become home to 2.4 billion seeds since opening, making it the world’s largest wild-plant seed bank. The aim of this “Noah’s ark” for plants, which is based in Wakehurst, Sussex, is to act as an “insurance policy” for rare, threatened and useful plants.\n\nSeals\n\nEngland’s largest grey seal colony is expected to have a record baby boom of 4,000 new arrivals this year. The colony at the National Trust’s Blakeney Nature Reserve in Norfolk has flourished due to low levels of disturbance in the first few weeks of life and a lack of natural predators on the long shingle spit where they have their young.\n\nNot-for-profit plumbing\n\nA plumber from Burnley who rose to internet fame for fixing vulnerable customers’ boilers for free said he has spent £50,000 supporting people this year. James Anderson also set up a food bank, settled bailiff bills for those unable to pay and provided PPE for local care homes and the NHS.\n\nChristmas spirit\n\nForestry workers hope felling the tree that will stand in Parliament Square can be the “start of Christmas” for people. The 30-year-old 43ft spruce was spotted five years ago growing in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, and selected as it will look good from all angles."
