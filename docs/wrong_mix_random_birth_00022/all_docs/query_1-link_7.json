        "text": "Pigeon Forge, Tennessee (November 9, 2023) —Dollywood’s HeartSong Lodge & Resort celebrated its grand opening this past weekend with a visit from international icon Dolly Parton. The lodge marks the second world-class resort created by Dollywood Parks & Resorts and Parton, further expanding the premier family destination located in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\nTucked away in the Smoky Mountains next to Dollywood’s original resort, Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort and Spa, the 302-room lodge was inspired by Parton’s love of the Great Smoky Mountains and blurs the lines between indoors and out, seamlessly blending mountain adventure and the world-class Dollywood experience that visitors know and love. Lodge guests are invited to explore nature, create memories and discover their own “heartsong”– that emotion that drives us, grounds us, sustains us and inspires us.\n\n“Dollywood’s HeartSong Lodge & Resort takes me back to when I was a little girl exploring my beautiful Smoky Mountains,” Parton said. “I have so many fond memories of the days when us kids spent hours playing in the creek and chasing fireflies after supper. I hope families who come to my HeartSong Lodge discover what makes these mountains so special to me while creating their own precious memories.”\n\nHeartSong Lodge offers multiple room types to fit every family or group. Children will look forward to bedtime in bunk beds with private televisions designed just for them, while larger families and groups can enjoy spacious suites. Each guest room features a beautiful Smoky Mountain mural showcasing iconic animals like black bears, butterflies and fireflies, and is equipped with a mini-fridge, safe and customizable sound machine that generates the soothing notes of nature. The top-end HeartSong Suite offers an apartment-style guest room that blends natural colors and designs in a grand setting that boasts majestic views of the lodge’s Cove area and the surrounding Smokies.\n\nHeartSong Lodge offers several amenities and experiences for families to connect, recharge and play during their trip. Just beyond the lodge’s lantern-inspired lobby windows is The Cove, an outdoor area featuring cozy fire pits and an expansive pool area featuring a zero-depth entry pool with a cascading waterfall, splash pad, hot tub and seasonal poolside dining. The lodge also offers a variety of on-site activities through Camp DW, which encourages families to play and create together. Guests can choose from arts and crafts, storytelling and summertime pool parties. Each morning, families can enjoy Imagination Library Story Hour as Camp DW hosts read books from Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. At night, families gather around the outdoor fire pit for complimentary marshmallow roasting and an old-fashioned sing-along.\n\nThe lodge offers an array of dining options that are available to overnight guests and non-guests alike, including its full-service restaurant, Ember & Elm: Tastes Rooted in the Smokies. The à la carte breakfast and dinner menus provide guests with Southern favorites featuring items offered by local purveyors. Adjacent to Ember & Elm is High Note: Casual Dining & Drink, which provides guests with all-day dining options. For meals on the go, Songbird Market provides a convenient selection of grab-and-go options … including Dollywood’s world-famous cinnamon bread.\n\nInspired by Parton herself, Acoustic Lobby is a private dining room designed with detailed touches of the entertainment icon around every corner. The centerpiece of the room is a glittering chandelier made from acoustic guitars. The room also features items from Parton, including the outfit she wore during a HeartSong Lodge & Resort media event in June 2022 and a display of favorite instruments. Acoustic Lobby offers its own food and signature cocktail menus for private events. When not being used for such an event, the room will serve as another area for guests to enjoy each other’s company and make memories.\n\nWith the Great Smoky Mountains as a backdrop, HeartSong Lodge is a breathtaking venue for corporate and group events. With 26,000 square feet of flexible indoor and outdoor meeting space – including the two-story HeartSong Event Center and a breathtaking event lawn – the lodge offers numerous options to provide a unique and inspiring setting for groups ranging from 10 to 700 attendees.\n\nDollywood resort guests can take advantage of exclusive park privileges throughout their stay. These include complimentary transportation to and from Dollywood theme park and Dollywood’s Splash Country; complimentary Dollywood TimeSaver Passes to shorten ride wait times with a Dollywood ticket; early entry on Saturday mornings to a select ride or experience at the parks; and resort in-room delivery of purchases from the parks delivered directly to guest rooms free of charge."
