        "text": "\"Through research on Berlin, New York, Nashville, New Orleans, Los Angeles and beyond, this book shows how much there is to learn about the relationship between popular music and cities. It also includes fascinating discussion on places that have not been so commonly associated with popular music, including rural Australia and the Russian arctic, middle England and the Middle East. Sounds and the City will be an important addition to reading lists for those interested not only in music and cities but also in the geographical and global circulations of popular music and in cultural heritage and cultural memory, local identity and social change.\" - Sara Cohen, University of Liverpool, UK\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 26.74\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 35.30\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access"
