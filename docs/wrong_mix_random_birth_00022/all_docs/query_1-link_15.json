This ride is Dollywood's first ever launched coaster, representing a new frontier of innovation and excitement for the Smoky Mountain theme park. Lightning Rod launches riders from 0 to 45 mph in an incredible 3.5 seconds, immediately shooting them up a 165 foot tall hill that delivers stunning views of the Great Smoky Mountains.\n\nFrom there, the coaster traverses over 3,800 feet of track with multiple inversions, airtime hills, and highly banked turns taken at top speeds. With a max speed of 73 mph, Lightning Rod will be one of the fastest coasters in the U.S. when it opens. This breakneck pace is sure to get coaster enthusiasts' hearts pumping as fast as the ride itself.\n\nEarly reviews from coaster enthusiasts who got to experience Lightning Rod before it opened to the public have been glowing. The launch provides a sudden rush of acceleration that creates an immediate adrenaline surge. The airtime hills and inversions deliver thrills all along the course, with riders feeling weightless at multiple points. Even seasoned roller coaster veterans have called Lightning Rod an instant top 10 coaster thanks to its speed, airtime, and smoothness.\n\nLightning Rod is significant for Dollywood because it represents the park's commitment to staying at the forefront of coaster technology and innovation. While Dollywood has always appealed to families, with Lightning Rod they are making a play to attract the hardcore thrill seekers as well. Now enthusiasts from around the country will plan trips to experience Dollywood's one-of-a-kind launched coaster.\n\nFor those who have enjoyed Dollywood's coasters like Thunderhead and Wild Eagle in the past, Lightning Rod takes the park's ride portfolio to the next level. It combines extreme acceleration and speed with airtime and inversions for a complete thrill machine. Thanks to the engineering of Swiss coaster experts Bolliger & Mabillard, Lightning Rod manages to pack a smooth, intense ride into its compact 3,800 foot layout.\n\nWhat else is in this post?\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - New Ride 'Lightning Rod' Debuts\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - Dollywood Splash Country Expands Water Park\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - Campground Upgrades Complete\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - New Festival 'Great Pumpkin LumiNights' Launches\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - Dolly Parton Performing New Show\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - More Family-Friendly Activities Added\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - New Dining Options Coming Soon\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - Major Park Expansion Announced\n\nRollin' into 2024: What's New and Exciting at Dollywood This Year - Dollywood Splash Country Expands Water Park\n\nIn addition to debuting a world-class roller coaster, Dollywood is enhancing their water park Dollywood's Splash Country for the 2024 season.

With a ride time of almost 5 minutes, it's one of the longest and most immersive water rides in the region.\n\nRiverRush reflects Dollywood's commitment to rides the whole family can experience together. The larger rafts mean kids as young as 4 can join in the excitement with their parents and siblings. Yet the rapids and tunnels provide thrills for everyone. RiverRush rounds out the diverse ride portfolio at Splash Country, joining body slides, tube slides, splash areas for toddlers, and more.\n\nIn addition to RiverRush, Splash Country is debuting a fun new area called Lily Pad Lagoon.

These artistic pumpkins representing classic Halloween motifs like black cats and ghosts light up pathways with a special ambience.
