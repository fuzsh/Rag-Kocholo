        "text": "Find fitness you love in 4 days of mini-workshops with Fitness & Mindset Coach Kourtney Thomas. Enroll now to learn how to cultivate a more loving relationship with your body, today.\n\nNot feeling all that confident in your skin lately?\n\nIf you’ve been struggling to feel good in your body, to embrace body changes, or to fit in fitness in a life that looks a little different – this event is for you. I’m going to help you tap into 4 unexpected but wildly effective ways to not only find fitness you actually love, but find more love for your body while you do it.\n\nWho’s hosting?\n\nKourtney Thomas, CSCS,*D (that’s me!), is a self-discovery and body image coach for women who want to know what the heck they’re doing, because everyone needs the blunt (but kind) reminder that the only “right” way to do something is the way that works for YOU. In the last decade, Kourtney has worked her way from personal trainer and endurance running coach at a facility, to successful business owner, sought-after contributor, and real-life difference-maker for her clients and audience.\n\nWith her background in fitness, business, and life coaching, Kourtney has a gift for understanding all kinds of people, building instant rapport, and saying what she means without being mean. She helps women cut through the fluff to the conversations that matter so they can find their inner Dolly Parton. There aren’t confetti cannons around here, but there’s a whole lot of grit and growth. When she’s not coaching, Kourtney enjoys bicep curls and hiking fueled by cake in Denver, CO, where she lives with her husband, dog, and cat.\n\nWhat you’re in for.\n\nYou’re going to learn insightful and useful stuff in a power-packed 4 days!\n\nEach day, you’ll get a short (less than 10 minutes!) video body love lesson delivered directly to your inbox. Plus, quick daily assignments and journaling worksheets, a free community for body love chat, and an exclusive Q&A session with me, Kourtney!\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn…\n\nRESPECT.\n\nIt’s time to hold yourself in the same high regard you hold others in your life. I’ll show you how to start.\n\nCARE.\n\nYou care for all the wonderful people in your life, you get to care for yourself too. I’ll teach you the quickest path to doing it with zero guilt.\n\nJOY.\n\nYou deserve to take joy where you can get it! I’ll reveal how it connects to fitness and exercise, and how to use it as a body love strategy.\n\nAUTHORITY.\n\nYou are the influencer of your body and your life. I’ll show you how to apply everything you’ve learned, with authority, to Boost your body love, right now and always.\n\nHey. Look.\n\nYou do not need another quick fix to solve the problem of your body.\n\nYour body is not a problem. You do not need to be fixed.\n\nAll you need to do is step outside the cycle that’s more hurt than help.\n\nIt’s time to Boost your body love.\n\nSign up today and don’t forget to share with your friends!\n\nSee you there!"
