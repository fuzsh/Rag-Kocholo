        "text": "Musical Leisure: Sonic Ties against Commodification and Exploitative Forms of Lives\n\nI this talk, I engage with musical leisure as the framework that helps us to understand the potentialities and limits of sound and music in shaping alternative ways of collective engagement and organizing. Considering the historical and contemporary examples of the involvement in the amateur, non-monetized music/sound-related activities, my goal is to open discussion on the waged and unwaged productive time in ethnomusicological explorations. Starting from the question of what does it mean to be connected through/by music and sound in our leisure time, I discuss the potential fields of resistance to the precarity and exhaustion caused by exploitative modes of existence. I focus on the practices of politicization of a field of leisure and their potentials and limits in resisting the contemporary neoliberal work-leisure misbalances in order to show how the perspective of musical leisure is missing historical knowledge and experience that can intervene in the ongoing critical conversations about the corporate, privatized and deeply individualized consumerist ethos.\n\nI would address three specific topics: 1) critical engagement with capitalist commodification, alienation, and exploitation and its dismissal of class perspective to understand the social relations 2) the role of musical leisure in mobilizing people to live, persist, and resist to the precariousness, labour instability and feeling of uncertainty 2) the ways communal leisure activities can serve as emancipatory vehicle for building new forms of solidarity across national borders.\n\nAna Hofman is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Culture and Memory Studies, Research Centre of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana. Her research interests include music, sound, and politics in socialist and post-socialist societies, with an emphasis on memory, affect, and activism in the present-day conjuncture of neoliberalism and post-socialism in the area of former Yugoslavia. She has published two monographs, Staging Socialist Femininity: Gender Politics and Folklore Performances in Serbia (2011), and Music, Affect, Politics: New Lives of Partisan Songs in Slovenia (2015), dealing with contemporary musical recuperation of the World War II Yugoslav antifascist resistance. She served as co-editor (with Federico Spinetti and Monika E. Schoop ) of a 2020 Special Issue of Popular Music and Society, titled “Music and the Politics of Memory: Resounding Antifascism across Borders” She recently edited the volume (with Tanja Petrović) Affect’s Social Lives: Post-Yugoslav Reflections (2023).\n\nDr. Hofman teaches at the ZRC SAZU Postgraduate School, Ljubljana. She was a Visiting Researcher at the School of Music, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, Halle, Germany and the Department of Music, University of Chicago. She has also been appointed as Postdoctoral Fulbright Fellow at the Graduate School of City University of New York in 2018. The same year, she received the Danubius Mid-Career Award from the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research and the Institute for Central Europe and Danube Region. Dr. Hofman is currently working on a monograph on strategic amateurism, politics of leisure and musical afterlives of socialism after Yugoslavia (Oxford University Press)."
