From a humble upbringing in the Dakota plains, Sotera earned her degree in design from the University of Minnesota. She returned to the Twin Cities from the West Coast to work on Prince’s movie Graffiti Bridge. He took notice of her work ethic and asked her to help with the Glam Slam club he was building in downtown Minneapolis, creating a “creative director” position just for her, for all things visual. Sotera’s direction duties included art design, photo shoots, sets for music videos and tours, album covers, music instruments (including the gun microphone), furniture, and Paisley Park itself. Her work can be seen in the music videos of international hits like “Get Off”, “7”, “Sexy M.F.”, “Money Don’t Matter 2nite”, and many more. Her milestone project came when Prince asked her to create a new symbol that would come to represent his new name, the extensive research for which was done largely at the U of M libraries. Today Sotera lives and works in Twin Cities, designing and inventing products for some of America’s largest retailers.\n\nSpecial performance"
