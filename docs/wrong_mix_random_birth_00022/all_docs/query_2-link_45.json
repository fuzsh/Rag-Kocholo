        "text": "Lerner and Loewe’s classic Tony Award-winning musical will close the 2017–2018 Season\n\nWashington, D.C. –Shakespeare Theatre Company today announces the cast of Lerner and Loewe’s multiple Tony Award-winning musical Camelot. Directed by STC Associate Artistic Director Alan Paul (Kiss Me, Kate; Man of La Mancha), the classic musical will play at Sidney Harman Hall (610 F St NW) from May 22 through July 1, concluding STC’s 2017-2018 mainstage season.\n\nWith the much-beloved music of Lerner and Loewe (My Fair Lady), Camelot depicts the powerful love triangle between King Arthur, his Queen, Guenevere, and the knight Lancelot. It also tells a strikingly familiar tale of a leader’s integrity, courage and empathy—a chronicle of the struggle for civilization and goodness in a world accustomed to violence and hate, and a hymn to an era of leadership that upheld idealism and championed the potential of humankind.\n\n“The tale of King Arthur is intriguing no matter what age you are,” said Alan Paul. “It’s about the birth of enlightened government, love, honor and the ideals of chivalry. I’m excited to introduce this musical to a new generation.”\n\nAlmost 60 years after it premiered on Broadway, the enchanting score, featuring If Ever I Would Leave You and I Loved You Once in Silence, continues to captivate musical theatre audiences.\n\nSTC Affiliated Artists Ted van Griethuysen (Merlyn) and Floyd King (King Pellinore) will join an impressive cast of actors including Ken Clark (King Arthur), Nick Fitzer (Lancelot du Lac) and Grammy Award-nominee Alexandra Silber (Guenevere), who will make their STC debuts.\n\nHelen Hayes Award-winning Choreographer Michele Lynch reunites with Paul after their celebrated production of Kiss Me, Kate. Camelot’s set will be created by Scenic Designer Walt Spangler, whose work for STC includes Strange Interlude, Old Times, and many others. Costume Designer Ana Kuzmanic returns to STC after designing King Lear starring Stacey Keach. Lighting Designer Robert Wierzel’s previous work at STC includes Man of La Mancha, As You Like It, The Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Little Foxes. Award-winning Sound Designer Ken Travis, who last worked with Paul on his production of Man of La Mancha, will also join the artistic team.\n\nABOUT THE DIRECTOR\n\nSTC Associate Artistic Director Alan Paul credits for STC include: Romeo & Juliet; Kiss Me, Kate; Man of La Mancha (Helen Hayes nominee, Best Director); A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (Helen Hayes Award, Best Director); The Boys from Syracuse; The Winter’s Tale (Free For All); Twelfth Night (Free For All); As You Like It (Associate Director); Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2 (Associate Director); numerous galas, readings, and special events; Assistant Director: 13 shows.
