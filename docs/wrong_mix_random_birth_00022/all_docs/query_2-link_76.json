I recently learned about Caitlyn through a mutual friend and started listening to her music and was blown away. I've been a bit obsessed with her for the past few months. Especially since this all happened when her name was brought to my attention.\n\nYou can listen to the LIVE interview with Caitlyn Smith by clicking on the player below.\n\nCaitlynSmith/Youtube\n\nCHILLS\n\nCaitlyn Smith is not only an amazing singer, she's also a very talented guitarist and songwriter. \"If a song doesn't give me chills at some point, then I don't want to put it on a record. I want to feel and believe every song.\"-Caitlyn Smith. The song 'I Can't' (above) she sings with Old Dominion.\n\nAccording to her official bio, that has always been her mantra. She was nominated for the ACM New Female Artist of the Year with songs by recording artists Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton, Meghan Trainor, John Legend, and Garth Brooks to name a few, and won her a Critics Choice Award.\n\nPLAYING WITH THE BIG DOGS\n\nShe's been opening for some major acts, including George Strait, Reba, Little Big Town, and Old Dominion, which lead to her debut on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" after Kelly saw Caitlyn opening for George Strait in Vegas.\n\nCaitlyn Smith/Youtube"
