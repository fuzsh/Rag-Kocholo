        "text": "This show is hydromatic, this show is systematic! For nearly 50 years, West End audiences and Grease have gone together like \"rama lama lama...\" in London. We all wish we could enroll for our high school years at Rydell High, and be a part of high school groups, the Pink Ladies and the Burger Palace Boys. Instead, we have to imagine we're at Rydell High instead. Now, the days of imagining are over, as Grease returns to London.\n\nThe eighth Grease West End revival opens in 2023. This Grease adaptation rethinks the story with added grit and verve, and the end result is a musical with more energy than the Greased Lightning car. But there's all the fan-favourite moments to look out for too! Here's why you need to see Grease in the West End.\n\nBook Grease tickets on London Theatre.\n\nWhat is Grease about?\n\nThe Grease musical follows a high school romance between Danny Zuko and Sandy Dumbrowski. One summer, Danny and Sandy fell in love, but had to say their goodbyes as they didn't live near each other. Later that summer, Sandy moves to a new area, and enrolls at Rydell High for her senior year. Little does she know that Danny Zuko also attends that high school! When the pair realise they're walking down the same school corridors, can Danny and Sandy make their true love last a lifetime?\n\nWhile the Grease story centres on Danny and Sandy, there's plenty of moments to watch out for in Grease that don't involve them. During Grease, Rizzo learns that she might be pregnant, and Frenchy decides to drop out of high school to pursue a beauty career. Grease is filled with the trials and tribulations of teenage love, lust, and heartbreak — a definitive high school musical.\n\nWhere is Grease playing?\n\nGrease in London is at the Dominion Theatre. The Dominion Theatre is one of the largest West End theatres, with over 2,000 seats. The Dominion Theatre is located at the end of Oxford Street, on the junction with Tottenham Court Road.\n\nHow long is Grease?\n\nThe running time of Grease in London is 2 hours and 30 minutes, including a 20-minute interval.\n\nWhat days is Grease playing?\n\nGrease plays eight performances a week at the Dominion Theatre, with matinee performances on Thursday and Saturday, and evening performances Monday through Saturday. For the complete performance schedule and show times, visit the Grease page on London Theatre.\n\nWhen did Grease premiere?\n\nThe Grease film popularised the show's story, but the Grease musical came first! Chicago's Kingston Mines Theatre Company staged the Grease world premiere in 1971. The production took place just minutes away from William Howard Taft School, where the Grease setting of Rydell High is based on.\n\nGrease quickly attracted New York City producers, opening Off-Broadway on Valentine's Day, 14 Feb. 1972. Months later, Grease opened on Broadway and ran for eight years.\n\nThe Grease British musical premiere took place in Coventry, ahead of a West End opening in 1973. To date, there have been seven Grease revivals in London: 1979, 1993, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2022, and now 2023.\n\nWho wrote Grease?\n\nJim Jacobs and Warren Casey wrote the book, the music, and the lyrics for the Grease musical. Together, they'd previously acted in shows at the Chicago Stage Guild, and collaborated on a \"rock and roll high school musical\" set in 1950s Chicago. In fact, Grease is inspired by William Howard Taft School in Chicago, Jacobs' alma mater. Unlike most musical theatre writers, Jim Jacob and Warren Casey only had one successful musical.\n\nWho is in Grease?\n\nLouise Redknapp will play Teen Angel. The Eternal singer last starred in Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 at the Savoy Theatre. Find out more about Louise Redknapp in Grease. Peter Andre and Jason Donovan will also play Teen Angel, reprising their 2022 performances.\n\nDan Partridge, Olivia Moore, and Jocasta Almgill will return to play Danny, Sandy, and Rizzo, alongside Olivia Foster-Browne as Frenchy, Ellie Kingdon as Marty, Katie Brace as Jan, Soloman Davy as Kenickie, Callum Henderson as Roger, Jake Reynolds as Doody, and George Michaelides as Sonny.\n\nJayd’n Tyrone will play Eugene, alongside Chloe Saunders as Patty Simcox, Katie Dunsden as Cha Cha, Liam McHugh as Johnny Casino, Darren Bennett as Vince Fontaine and Teen Angel at certain performances, Rachel Stanley as Miss Lynch, and Michael Anderson, Alicia Belgrade, Kirsty Ingram, Jordan Isaac, D’Mia Lindsay-Walker, Carly Miles, Luke Redmore, Samuel Routley, Darcey Simmons, Sario Solomon, Joshua Steel, and Allana Taylor.\n\nGrease Characters\n\nThere's many recognisable Grease characters that appear in both the Grease film and the Grease musical.

Many of his peers rely on Zuko to tell them what to do, and he influences many events at the school. During the summer before his senior year, Zuko falls in love with Sandy Dumbrowski.\n\nSandy Dumbrowski: Sandy Dumbrowski is a senior highschooler who enrols at Rydell High for her final school year. That summer, she'd fallen for rough-around-the-edges Danny Zuko, but doesn't realise his true personality until they meet again at school. Sandy changes her personality to fit in with Danny, and becone a part of the Pink Ladies.\n\nBetty Rizzo: Betty Rizzo's name is shortened to Rizzo in Grease. Rizzo is the leader of the Pink Ladies, a popular female \"gang\" at Rydell High. Rizzo appears to have a tough exterior, mocking her fellow schoolmates and feuds with Danny. But as the show develops, it's clear that Rizzo isn't quite as emotionally detached as it first appears.\n\nKenickie: Kenickie is Danny's best friend, and second-in-command in the Burger Palace Boys gang. Kenickie spends a great deal of time with his car, Greased Lightning. He's in an on-off relationship with Rizzo, and a pregnancy scare shakes his life up.\n\nFrenchy: Frenchy is part of the Pink Ladies at Rydell High, but during her senior year, Frenchy drops out to enrol in beauty school.

Marty and Jan complete the Pink Ladies quintet. Then, there's other teenagers at Rydell High including preppy cheerleader Patty Simcox, and valedictorian Eugene.\n\nNo high school is complete without teachers, and eclectic English teacher Miss Lynch definitely shakes things up.
