        "text": "Beyoncé’s history-making No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart was celebrated by a country icon: Dolly Parton.\n\nAfter Beyoncé’s single “Texas Hold ‘Em” became a hit, turning the superstar into the first Black woman to have a chart-topping track on the Billboard Hot Country chart, Parton released a statement on social media, applauding the accomplishment.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nBeyoncé to Fund $500K Grant for Cosmetology Schools and Salons\n\nBeyoncé Teases Upcoming Haircare Brand Cécred\n\nThe-Dream on Oscars Shortlist, Why He'd Give His Kidney to Beyoncé and How Losing His Mother Connected Him to 'Color Purple'\n\nShe wrote, “I’m a big fan of Beyoncé and very excited that she’s done a country album. So congratulations on your Billboard Hot Country number one single. Can’t wait to hear the full album!”\n\nIn the comments, other artists applauded Parton for championing Beyoncé, including Brittney Spencer, Morgane Stapleton and Queen Latifah.\n\nBeyoncé surprise-released both “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “16 Carriages” during the 2024 Super Bowl to announce her upcoming country album, Act II, which is scheduled to arrive March 29. “Texas Hold ‘Em” quickly became the fan favorite of the two, while “16 Carriages” reached the No. 9 spot on the chart.\n\nHowever, her venture into country music wasn’t embraced by all fans of the genre.\n\nSome country fans took to social media to claim that the 32-time Grammy winner’s music doesn’t fit within the genre. Additionally, on Feb. 13, a Kentucky native shared a screenshot on X of an email they received from their local country radio station KYKC, which read: “Hi – we do not play Beyonce’ on KYKC as we are a country music station. Thank you.”\n\nAfter the tweet went viral, the general manager for South Central Oklahoma Radio Enterprises, which oversees KYKC, told CBS News that both of Beyoncé country singles were added to KYKC’s playlist, as well as to playlists from two other stations overseen by the company.\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter"
