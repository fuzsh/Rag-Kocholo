        "text": "The Christmas atmosphere in Europe appears lively from early December 2023, even while still in Turkey. Christmas tree ornaments are set up in almost every corner of the city and along the highway.\n\nEven in many cities, local residents hold Christmas Festivals or Christmas Markets that sell a variety of Christmas necessities and other basic necessities. This festival always takes place every year during the month of December. In certain cities, this event even starts as early as mid-November.\n\nArrival in Belgrade\n\nI arrived in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, on Saturday (23/12/2023) afternoon. That day, I cycled from Jagodina City, still in Serbia. When I left the city at around 8:46, the drizzle didn't want to stop. The air temperature was only 4 degrees Celsius. Quite cold.\n\nThe clothing I wear also adjusts to the temperature. The innermost layer is the baselayer, followed by a winter cycling jersey, a winter cycling jacket with a windbreaker layer, long sleeve, and winter padded pants.\n\nCycling shoes for the winter season, along with thick socks and gloves. Then, a head cover and a balaclava for the face, nose, and mouth. Wearing these layered clothes makes me quite comfortable while pedaling my bike.\n\nThe path that I passed through was quite deserted, far from the busy four-wheeled vehicles. There was no specific bike lane, but while cycling, I was not bothered by passing vehicles at all. The road was truly empty. The rural atmosphere was very strong.\n\nOn this route, there are still many abandoned houses belonging to local residents. The owners reportedly migrate to other countries, especially Germany, to find work with decent salaries. Agricultural land also remains neglected, accounting for around 20 percent.\n\nWhile in the homes of remaining citizens, it is very common to keep dogs. When they saw me passing through their territory, the dogs immediately started barking. However, they were tied up so they only made noise from behind the house gate.\n\nBesides the cold weather, this journey had almost no challenges. The road terrain was also relatively flat. Therefore, I did not have to exert too much effort even though I had to cycling a fairly long distance.\n\nI didn't really struggle even though I cycled a relatively long distance.\n\nAt approximately 4:00pm, I arrived in the city of Brestovic. The total distance traveled was 101.15 kilometers with a total elevation gain of 615 meters.\n\nFrom the city of Brestovic, I chose to travel to the city of Beograd. The distance was approximately 34 kilometers. We arrived in the Serbian capital in the late afternoon. After taking a short break at the hotel, we went to a small restaurant located not far from our accommodation. That night, we enjoyed delicious Serbian bread.\n\nThe next day, Sunday (24/12/2023), I chose to rest in Belgrade. In the morning at 10.00 am, I managed to attend a Catholic Mass at the Church of Saint Anthony of Padua.\n\nI walked approximately 500 meters to the bus stop, then took the bus for several minutes, and finally got off and walked another 300 meters. I arrived at the church, where only half of the capacity was filled with attendees. There were quite a few empty seats.\n\nThis Catholic church is one of the largest in Belgrade. However, Orthodox Christian church buildings are generally even larger. The majority of Belgrade's population are followers of Orthodox Christianity.\n\nStrengthen each other\n\nAfter returning from church, I took the crew on a tour around the city of Beograd using the city bus. We also enjoyed Chinese cuisine at one of the city's restaurants, where there was noodle soup. It was truly delicious. It turns out that Asian cuisine is very popular in Europe.\n\nIn the evening, I attended the Christmas Eve mass at the same church. The attendees were numerous. All the seats inside the church were filled to capacity. In fact, some of the congregation were forced to stay outside the building. Incredible.\n\nThis Christmas Eve service is even more interesting because there is a very good choir. Not many people are singing, but their vocal harmony is very cohesive, complementing one another.\n\nHowever, the Christmas atmosphere in Belgrade is not as festive as in other areas of Europe, and even falls short compared to Indonesia. This is because the majority of the inhabitants of Belgrade and Serbia in general are followers of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas every January 7th. It is said that during that time, the Christmas atmosphere in Serbia is very lively.\n\nOn Christmas Day, December 25th, 2023, in the morning, I spent some time communicating with my wife and children in Jakarta through a video call. They were all present. We exchanged Christmas greetings and strengthened each other.\n\nThis is the first time I celebrate Christmas away from my family. While on duty in West Papua, Maluku, and North Sulawesi, children come to visit us during the holiday season. As a police chief, I cannot leave my duties during Christmas.\n\nAs I celebrate Christmas this year, I am reminded of the legendary singers Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers who once sang a song called \"Christmas Without You.\" Christmas that wouldn't feel the same without you.\n\nThat afternoon, we were on our way to the Indonesian Embassy to meet with the Indonesian Ambassador to Serbia, Mr. Chandra Widya Yudha. I left my lodging and rode my bike along the corners of the city following the bike path.\n\nBelgrade Fortress\n\nI once visited the Beograd Fortress. This fortress is very vast and large, covering an area of 66 hectares and dating back to 279 BC. The fortress is the origin of Beograd and now serves as one of the most popular tourist destinations.\n\nBelgrade is one of the oldest cities in Europe. It is a beautiful city with many historical relics. Serbia is also one of the Balkan countries with a long history. Prior to its independence, Serbia was part of Yugoslavia along with Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Macedonia.\n\nYugoslavia has undergone several changes in name. First, it was the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and later the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. In 2006, Serbia officially separated into the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro.\n\nBelgrade has become an iconic city in Central Europe. A city with a population of approximately 1.4 million people located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers. It is also a center of culture, education, science, and economy in Serbia, even being home to many residents for the past 7,000 years.\n\nAt 1:00 PM, we arrived at the Indonesian Embassy office. Pak Chandra and the staff of the embassy were waiting for us at the office. From there, we went directly to the Indonesian Embassy Residence which is located within the same complex.\n\nWe exchanged information. I told about my journey from Jakarta to Serbia, all the ups and downs. Moreover, this trip has become an interesting and exciting experience. On the other hand, Ambassador and staff talked about Serbian society and the city of Belgrade.\n\nAt that moment, I handed over a plaque from the General Chairman of the Indonesian National Police Retirees Association, Mr. Bambang Hendarso Danuri, to the Serbian Ambassador. This plaque serves as a reminder that there is a Polri retiree who arrived at the Indonesian Embassy in Serbia by bicycle from Jakarta.\n\nAfterwards, Mr. Chandra invited us to dine at an Asian restaurant that serves Chinese cuisine. The restaurant is located by the Danube River. We ate heartily and the culinary delights were incredibly delicious.\n\nAccording to Mr. Chandra, during the summer season, the restaurant is always full of visitors, even to the outside area. Visitors want to enjoy the dining atmosphere by the clean riverbank.\n\nWhile eating, Pak Chandra shared stories about his childhood. When he was born, his father was a volunteer who was undergoing Basic Military Training in preparation for the Indonesia-Malaysia conflict in Kalimantan. His father then named him Chandra Widya Yudha."
