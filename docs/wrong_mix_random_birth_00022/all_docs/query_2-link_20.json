        "text": "Elle King took to Instagram on Sunday and spoke out about her performance at a January tribute to Dolly Parton. During her stage time, she slurred words, forgot lyrics, and cursed, the latter a major no-no at the staid Grand Ol‚Äô Opry.\n\nKing, 34, was one of multiple country stars who took the stage. She admitted to being ‚Äúhammered.‚Äù\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nPitbull Calls Dolly Parton Music Collab An \"Honor\": \"She's The Real Deal\"\n\nBeyonc√© Given The Country Music Seal Of Approval By Dolly Parton\n\nDolly Parton On Potential 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' Revival: \"They're Still Working On That\"\n\nThe Instagram post on Sunday included a video of King running up and down the stands of a concert venue during a workout.\n\n‚ÄúTo everyone sending me love because I‚Äôm human and already talked to Dolly üíÖ I love you,‚Äù she wrote over the video. ‚ÄúTo everyone who told me to k*ll myself, I love you too.‚Äù\n\nIn the post‚Äôs caption, King said, ‚ÄúOh no was my human showingü´∂‚ù§Ô∏èü´Ç,‚Äù and added a hashtag, ‚Äú#WWDD,‚Äù seemingly standing for ‚ÄúWhat would Dolly do?‚Äù\n\nKing postponed several concerts in the wake of her Opry appearance and rescheduled them for later this year.\n\nShe shared the new dates on her Instagram Story for shows in Shipshewana, Indiana; Waukegan, Illinois; Harris, Michigan; and Dallas, Texas.\n\n‚ÄúYour tickets will be valid for the new dates. If you can‚Äôt make the new date, refunds are available at the point of purchase,‚Äù King wrote. ‚ÄúSee you there!‚Äù\n\nParton came to King‚Äôs defense in an interview with Extra as she issued a plea to ‚Äúforgive‚Äù her.\n\n‚ÄúElle is really a great artist. She‚Äôs a great girl, and she‚Äôs been going through a lot of hard things lately,‚Äù Parton said. ‚ÄúAnd she just had a little too much to drink, so let‚Äôs just forgive that and forget it and move on, ‚Äôcause she felt worse than anyone ever could.‚Äù\n\nKing returned to the stage earlier this month for the first time since the January incident, appearing at the Extra Innings Festival in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry apologized for the January 19 incident on social media. ‚ÄúWe deeply regret and apologize for the language that was used during last night‚Äôs second Opry performance,‚Äù the venue said. ‚ÄúFor our first time at The Opry, it was a shame we all had to witness that.‚Äù\n\nKing also struggled on New Year‚Äôs Eve Live: Nashville‚Äôs Big Bash. Before performing her track ‚ÄúDrunk (And I Don‚Äôt Want to Go Home),‚Äù King said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK, I live what I sing, y‚Äôall,‚Äù and appeared to slur her words during that performance."
