        "text": "Los Angeles theater comes alive this Spring with incredible live performances, talented playwrights and directors, beautiful productions and whimsical storytelling. Unlike Broadway in NYC, L.A. theater is spread out, which may take a little bit of pre-planning. Theater institutions such as the Hollywood Pantages Theatre, the Music Center, The Geffen Playhouse and the Civic Arts Plaza have an array of productions that will delight and engage. These are the five best bets for May 2017.\n\nThe Bodyguard The Musical\n\nThe Hollywood Pantages Theatre\n\n6233 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90028\n\n(323) 468-1770\n\nwww.hollywoodpantages.com\n\nDate: May 2 - May 21, 2017\n\nAn unforgettable cinematic love story from the 90s starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, \"The Bodyguard The Musical\" is based on the film of course. Some of Houston's most celebrated songs from \"The Bodyguard\" including \"One Moment In Time,\" \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\" and \"I Will Always Love You,\" the famous Houston cover version from Dolly Parton's hit, among other popular hits,are featured in this musically-driven theater production featuring concert lighting and amazing sound effects. Angelenos will finally get the opportunity to fall in love with main character superstar Rachel Marron and her bodyguard played by Judson Mills. Deborah Cox plays the pop singer.

Known for her award-winning play \"Photograph 51,\" which starred Nicole Kidman, Ziegler's newest drama takes on two Princeton first-years who spend the night together.

It quickly earned critical success and Tony Awards, and has graced the Broadway stage for more than 10 years. In 2015, Hollywood made it into an Oscar-worthy movie musical, and today the whimsical theater production tours the nation. Los Angeles theater-goers will have the up close opportunity to experience the musical fairy tale (music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine), which entangles plots, characters and journeys from several Brothers Grimm and Charles Perrault imaginative stories such as \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" \"Jack and the Beanstalk,\" \"Rapunzel\" and \"Cinderella.\" The Ahmanson Theatre recently announced its next season which will feature Something Rotten! and The Red Shoes.\n\nArchduke\n\nMark Taper Forum\n\n135 North Grand Ave.\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90012\n\n(213) 628-2772\n\nwww.centertheatregroup.org\n\nDate: April 25 - June 4, 2017\n\nThe Mark Taper Forum presents the world premiere and a Center Theatre Group commission of playwright Rajiv Joseph's \"Archduke.\" Not a newcomer to the Taper, Joseph who is a Pulitzer Prize finalist (Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo) and Obie Award winner, rounds up a group of three young men in Belgrade 1914 in Archduke.
