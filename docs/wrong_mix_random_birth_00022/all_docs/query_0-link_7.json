        "text": "Amy Winehouse has been booed and jeered at a concert in Serbia's capital that kicked off her European tour.\n\nSerbian media described the performance last night at Belgrade's fortress before some 20,000 fans as a \"scandal\" and a \"disaster\".\n\nMedia reported the singer was an hour late, before stumbling to the stage and mumbling through her songs. She occasionally disappeared, and her band playing instead.\n\nThe crowd responded angrily. Tickets cost about £35 - very expensive in the country where average salaries are about £264 a month.\n\nWinehouse recently spent a week at a rehab programme in London. Her 2006's Back to Black, won her five Grammy Awards, but her music has been overshadowed by drug use and run-ins with the law."
