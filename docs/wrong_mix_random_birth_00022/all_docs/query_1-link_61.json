Steve Daines (R-MT) this week urged the bosses at two national parks in Montana to help improve visitation at some of the state’s smaller parks. “As we continue to see record-breaking visitation numbers, encouraging visitation to smaller parks in Montana is imperative to both reduce stress on larger parks and promote healthy gateway economies in other regions,” Sen. Daines wrote in an Oct. 9 letter sent to Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cameron Sholly and Glacier National Park Superintendent Jeff Mow.\n\n“Tourism is one of Montana’s leading economic drivers, which is why I am committed to increasing visitation to all of Montana’s national parks, battlefields, historic sites and more,” added the senator.

With a small investment of just $500, they were able to reach an audience of 50,000 during the one-week (twice per day) run of an ad campaign that promoted the local rodeo and brewfest. The ads ran on the Yellowstone Public Radio which has 30 translators in Montana and Wyoming. The 36-word ad invited visitors to the local events and directed them to the visitgardinermt.com site. Neala Siegle, Executive Director of the Gardiner CVB, reported positive website traffic and that the events were well attended. In addition, the ad served as both informational and promotional to Gardiner residents, who reported hearing the ad.\n\nMontana in the News\n\nTourism Partner Shout-Outs, Recognition and News\n\nBelgrade—Belgrade’s Kostas Heads to Nashville for Induction into Songwriters Hall of Fame\n\nKostas Lazarides has at least 50 guitars scattered around the historic three-story building he owns in downtown Belgrade. It’s not surprising the prolific songwriter has an abundance of instruments, but it’s a bit abnormal that he lives a quiet life in a sleepy town.\n\nLazarides, known professionally as Kostas, has written chart-topping songs for several artists, including Patty Loveless, Travis Tritt and George Strait. On Monday, the 70-year-old joined the likes of Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and Chuck Berry when he’s inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. He’ll stand alongside other inductees Dwight Yoakam, Larry Gatlin, Rivers Rutherford, Marcus Hummon and Sharon Vaughn for a formal ceremony in Nashville’s Music City Hall.
