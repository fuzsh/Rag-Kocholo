        "text": "Montana loves country music and for many Montanans, that means that classic country music sound. You know the sound we're talking about. The fiddle mixed with that steel guitar sound that can be hard to find in modern country music.\n\nFor those who love classic country AND live music, you will want to mark the following dates down on your calendar, March 1st and March 2nd. Rob Wolf, who is a Nashville recording artist and a Montana native will be performing in both Bozeman and Missoula this weekend.\n\nRob, who was raised in Livingston is a talented singer/songwriter who tends to write about the things he loves the most, and one of those things is Montana.\n\nRob travels back and forth between Nashville and Montana as he continues to write and record new music, and now folks from his home state are going to have the chance to see him perform in Bozeman at the Rialto on Friday night. He will not only perform original songs but will throw in a few of everyone's favorites as well. Rob will hit the stage at 8 pm and while the concert is free, you do have to be 21 to enter.\n\nRob will also be in Missoula on Saturday night and playing the Top Hat at 10:15 pm.\n\nFans of live music will be excited to learn that Groove Solventless and Logjam Presents are putting on the show and are part of a free concert series that will take place for the next several months in downtown Bozeman.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the upcoming concert series that will include several different artists performing several different styles of music, check out the full lineup for the Bozeman shows by looking at the Logjam Presents website.\n\nTo learn more about Rob and listen to his music, or follow him on social media, check out his website at robwolf.com\n\nOnce again, the Bozeman show is this Friday night at the Rialto with Rob hitting the stage at 8 pm and Saturday night at the Top Hot in Missoula with Rob performing at 10:15 pm.\n\nThe Most \"Montana\" Towns In Montana\n\nIf you're looking for the best that Montana has to offer, you might want to start by asking a local and that is exactly what we did. We wanted to know which Montana towns were the most \"Montana\" and who better to ask than the folks who were born and raised in The Treasure State?\n\nGallery Credit: Derek Wolf"
