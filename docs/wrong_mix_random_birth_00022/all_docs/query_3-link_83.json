        "text": "Ever have a dream that made you say ‚ÄúWTF?‚Äù? Last night I had a doozy! If you‚Äôve had a crazy dream you‚Äôd like interpreted, it just so happens I have a dream interpretation service. For now though, indulge me in reading about my dream.\n\nWe (I was with another astrologer) were in Sedona watching the sky because there were these amazing storm systems overhead. We found ourselves standing in front of this huge rock formation that looked like a huge ‚ÄòO‚Äô. Then in the middle of the O, there was this huge explosion building up and I was filming it on my phone. The other astrologer said something like: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. We‚Äôre done‚Äù. Then everything exploded and we were knocked to the ground but we lived to tell the tale. My friend had huge Dolly Parton hair, lol. In dream interpretations, the 9th house (Regiomontanus) represents the dream (the chart is calculated from when I felt ready to think about what the dream means). I can‚Äôt even stop laughing with Uranus square Saturn. Venus is bang on my natal Jupiter in the 11th for my friend with the bouffy hair.\n\nHoroscopes\n\nIn the horoscopes I occasionally write for Yasmin Boland, I was telling everyone to be careful of acting impulsively (Mars in conjunct Jupiter). Standing unprotected in the middle of crazy weather defo qualifies for acting impulsively! Best to follow my own advice!\n\nHoroscopes are written well ahead of time so I had to go back and read what I had written for my own sign. I urged fellow Cancerians to get a move on and ‚Äòcoincidentally‚Äô I‚Äôve just launched my new book üôÇ\n\nMy post from Facebook yesterday: I am super pleased to announce that my next book ‚ÄúMirror Mirror: Famous People and the Actors Who Portrayed Them‚Äù is nearly ready. With over 300 pieces of data, the book was very difficult to edit and organise but the amazing Margaret Cahill and her team of super Virgos were absolutely brilliant. I‚Äôm extra pleased Julia Parker (yes THE Julia Parker) was so generous with her Foreword. To give a few examples of what‚Äôs inside, the book examines the synastry between Taron Egerton and Elton John in ‚ÄòRocketman‚Äô, Margot Robbie and Tonya Harding in ‚ÄòI, Tonya‚Äô and Tom Hulce and Mozart in ‚ÄòAmadeus‚Äô and many, many others. There will be an online book launch with Stormie Beaston which we‚Äôll sort out soon. You can order your copy in advance at: https://www.wessexastrologer.com/‚Ä¶/coming-soon-mirror‚Ä¶/ #films #astrology\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the chart for my dream:"
