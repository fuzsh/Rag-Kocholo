After volunteering with Collective Aid projects in Calais, Belgrade, and Subotica over the past six months, I have taken on the role of distribution coordinator in northern Serbia. The Subotica project distributes food, clothing, hygiene and shelter as well as providing mobile showers, laundry services and drinking water to people on the move seeking a better life in Europe. To read more about the conditions and border violence in northern Serbia, see our advocacy report published in collaboration with other NGOs working on the ground. Please consider supporting our work through sharing our advocacy publications or donating to help us continue to provide essential aid to those living at the border.
