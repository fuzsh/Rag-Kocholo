Fox Family (formerly known as the Fox Kids Network) is an American pay television channel owned by FX Networks, LLC, a subsidiary of the Disney Entertainment business segment and division of The Walt Disney Company. Aimed mainly at children 7 to 14 years old, the channel originally launched as the Fox Kids Network as a joint venture between News Corporation and Fox Family Worldwide Inc. on March 1, 1998, and later became one of the properties that was included in the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019. Fox Family offers an alternate Spanish-language audio feed, either via a separate channel with the English audio track removed as part of a package of Spanish-language television networks sold by subscription providers, or a separate audio track accessible through the SAP option, depending on the provider.

As of September 2018, Fox Family is available to approximately 87.8 million television households (94.2% of households with cable) in the United States.

Early years (1998–2001)[edit | edit source]

The Fox Kids Network was launched nationally as a basic cable channel on March 1, 1998, at noon Eastern Time. Initial programming on the channel consisted exclusively of reruns of 20th Century Fox cartoons such as the pre-1953 Twentieth Toons shorts and Alaina Gleen, and programming from the Fox Kids block itself including Bobby's World, Eek! The Cat, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Toonmania, The Whackems, Beverly Hills Teens (1994), The Magic School Bus, Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?, Goosebumps, X-Men, and The Tick. By the time the network launched, The Fox Kids Network's programming aired for sixteen hours each day from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. A challenge for the Fox Kids Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. At the time of its launch, the channel was only carried by 250 cable systems. However, it benefited from package deals. New subscribers to sister channels FX and fXM could also get access to the Fox Kids Network through such deals. The high ratings of the Fox Kids Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. More coming soon!

Rebranding as Fox Family and the Silver Age (2001–2008)[edit | edit source]

After Fox Family Worldwide was sold to The Walt Disney Company in July 2001, FX Networks, LLC had started an initial investment of $50 million to fully purchase and own the Fox Kids Network.
