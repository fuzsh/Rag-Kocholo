Today, Disney is worth an estimated $130 billion and retains a staggering media empire as well as other businesses.\n\nHere are 14 companies you might not have realized Disney owns.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n21st Century Fox was bought by Disney last year.\n\nDisney purchased 21st Century Fox for $71 billion in 2019 as it prepared to launch its Disney Plus streaming service. They acquired Fox's productions including \"The Americans,\" ''This Is Us,\" and \"Modern Family.\"\n\nDisney later removed \"Fox\" from the name of 20th Century Fox movie production studio.\n\nAs part of that deal, Disney took ownership of National Geographic, too.\n\nNational Geographic produces magazines, television shows, books, and documentaries about nature, wildlife, and travel. Disney acquired National Geographic when it bought 21st Century Fox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney also took over FX.\n\nFX hosts shows such as \"American Horror Story,\" \"American Crime Story,\" \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" and \"Fargo.\" Disney gained ownership of FX when it bought 21st Century Fox.\n\nIt also owns the majority of Hulu.\n\nDisney owned 30% of Hulu before the 21st Century Fox merger and now owns 60%. Comcast owns 30% and WarnerMedia owns the last 10%. Disney CEO Bob Iger hasn't ruled out combining Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and Hulu into one streaming service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than a decade before, Disney acquired the Muppets Studio.\n\nDisney acquired the Muppets, along with \"Bear in the Big Blue House,\" from The Jim Henson Company in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel joined the Disney family in 2009.\n\nDisney bought Marvel for $4 billion in 2009. CEO Bob Iger wrote in his memoir, \"The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned From 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company,\" that some executives initially resisted acquiring Marvel because it was \"too edgy\" and \"would tarnish the Disney brand.\"\n\nThe deal seems to have worked out for Disney. The MCU has grossed over $22.5 billion worldwide over 23 movies, and \"Avengers: Endgame\" beat out \"Avatar\" to become the biggest movie of all time with $2.8 billion globally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney also bought Lucasfilm that year.\n\nDisney paid $4 billion to acquire Lucasfilm, which includes Star Wars and Indiana Jones, in 2012. They earned the money back with \"The Force Awakens,\" \"Rogue One,\" and \"The Last Jedi,\" which grossed a collective $4.06 billion at the box office.\n\nDisney bought ABC in the '90s.\n\nIn 1996, the Walt Disney Company bought Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion and renamed it ABC, Inc, bringing shows like \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"The Bachelor,\" and \"Dancing with the Stars\" under the Disney umbrella.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat deal meant that Disney also owns the majority of ESPN, too.\n\nCapital Cities/ABC, Inc., which owns 80% of ESPN, was bought by Disney in 1996 for $19 billion, according to the New York Times.\n\nHearst Corporation owns the remaining 20% stake.\n\nIt shares ownership of A&E with Hearst.\n\nA&E features true crime shows such as \"The First 48\" and \"Cold Case Files,\" as well as reality shows like \"Dog the Bounty Hunter\" and \"Storage Wars.\" Disney and Hearst became partners, each acquiring 50% of A&E in 2012, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifetime is part of A&E — and therefore part-owned by Disney.\n\nRecent Lifetime movies have included \"Harry and Meghan: Becoming Royal\" and the docuseries \"Surviving R. Kelly.\"\n\nThe History Channel also came as part of the A&E deal.\n\nHistory is also a subsidiary of A&E with shows such as \"American Pickers,\" \"Vikings,\" and \"Project Blue Book.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney's venture capital arm invested in GoPro.\n\nSteamboat Ventures, named for the 1928 Mickey Mouse cartoon \"Steamboat Willie,\" invested an undisclosed amount in GoPro in 2013.\n\nDisney Music Group, the music recording branch of the Walt Disney Studios, owns Hollywood Records.\n\nHollywood Records was founded in 1989 by Michael Eisner, who was CEO of Disney at the time. Artists such as Demi Lovato, Queen, and Zendaya are currently signed with the label.\n\nRead next\n\nDisney\n\nAdvertisement"
