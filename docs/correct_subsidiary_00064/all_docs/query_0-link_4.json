In 1996, the division was merged with Saban Entertainment to form Fox Kids Worldwide.\n\nOn September 2001, Fox Family Worldwide (parent company of Saban and Fox Kids channels) was acquired by Disney. As Disney's license for Fox for Fox Kids name only outside US, in 2004 it was decided to rename Disney-owned Fox Kids channels as Jetix with various feeds gradually adopting that name.\n\nAfter Disney acquired remaining shares in Jetix Europe in years 2008-2009, the company decided to rebrand channels as Disney XD (except in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, where it was rebranded as local feed of Disney Channel.\n\nTracks used[]\n\nDue to the large number of production music cues used by channel's feeds, the track list has been split into these subpages)."
