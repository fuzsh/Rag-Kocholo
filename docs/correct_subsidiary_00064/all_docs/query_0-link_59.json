        "text": "Walt Disney has agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business for $52.4bn (Â£39bn), in a deal both companies said position them to compete in the rapidly changing media industry.\n\nThe purchase includes Fox's film and television studios, as well as its 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky.\n\nFox will form a news-focused company with its remaining assets.\n\nThe move is a sharp shift for 86-year-old Fox owner Rupert Murdoch after more than half a century of media expansion.\n\nMr Murdoch turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world's largest news and film empires.\n\nHe said the break-up makes sense amid new threats from online advertising and competitors who are streaming entertainment into homes via the internet.\n\nFox shareholders, who include the Murdochs, will get a 25% stake in the larger Disney.\n\n\"With today's announcement, we launch the next great leg of our journey,\" Rupert Murdoch said on Thursday in a call for investors.\n\nHe added later: \"Are we retreating? Absolutely not.\"\n\nIt expands Disney's offerings with the FX and National Geographic cable channels, and Fox's regional sports network in the US.\n\nThe purchase also extends Disney's global reach, adding media company Star India and Fox's interests in Sky plc and Tata Sky to its portfolio.\n\nDisney will also get majority control of the video streaming service Hulu, which is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner.\n\nDisney will assume $13.7bn in Fox debt as part of the stock deal, taking the total value of the transaction to more than $66bn.\n\nThe firm believes this deal will give it the scale to compete, and expects to wring \"at least\" $2bn in cost-savings out of the new company to boot.\n\nDavid Yelland, former editor of the Murdoch owned Sun newspaper in the UK, told the BBC the transaction puts Disney in pole position to compete with California's tech giants.\n\n\"In ten years time there'll be two Chinese giants and four US giants and [of the current entertainment companies] the only one that'll survive will be Disney.\"\n\nFox is creating a smaller firm focused on news and major live sports events in the US.\n\nIt will hold onto its flagship Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network.\n\nLachlan Murdoch said: \"While the merged business is about scale, the new Fox is about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive, challenger brand.\"\n\nThere has been speculation the deal opens the opportunity to reunite Fox with the news businesses which were spun-off in 2013 following a scandal over phone tapping in the UK.\n\nThat prompted the creation of a separate news publishing group, News Corp., which owns the Times and the Sun newspapers and remains controlled by the Murdochs.\n\nRupert Murdoch said the firm hasn't looked at that possibility and any move along those lines is \"way ahead\" in the future.\n\nAs part of the deal Fox shareholders will receive Disney stock, representing about 25% of the enlarged company.\n\nIn the UK, Fox is in the midst of a bid to buy the part of the broadcaster Sky that it doesn't already own. That bid is being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is due to publish provisional findings in January.\n\nThe BBC understands that the Disney deal will not alter that CMA investigation.\n\nIf the Sky purchase is approved, that deal would probably go through before the Disney purchase of Fox assets. So the whole of Sky would then be likely to transfer to Disney's ownership.\n\nIf not, then just the 39% of Sky currently in Fox's stable passes to Disney.\n\nRupert Murdoch said: \"If things go wrong, the existing [Sky] shares go to Disney. It will be up to them to decide what to do.\"\n\nEither way Sky's future will lie primarily in Disney's hands.\n\nThe companies said they expect to complete the transaction in 12 to 18 months.\n\nBut it is not clear how the deal - which increases consolidation in the movie and sports media industries - will be received by US competition regulators.\n\nThe US Department of Justice recently sued to block AT&T's $85.4bn deal to buy Time Warner, on the basis that it will raise prices for consumers and competitors.\n\nIt is possible officials would take a similarly dim view of a Disney-Fox tie up, in which case Disney would pay Fox a $2.5bn break-up fee.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America West, a union that represents writers for television and movies, said it opposes the deal on the grounds that it would increase Disney's already sizeable power.\n\nIt said: \"The antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant.\""
