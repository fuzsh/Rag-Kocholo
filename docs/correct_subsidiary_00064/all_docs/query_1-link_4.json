        "text": "Background\n\nFox Kids Worldwide was originally formed in 1990 as Fox Children's Productions, serving as the production unit of the then-newly-launched Fox Kids block which was a joint venture between the News Corporation, owner of the Fox network and its affiliates. In 1996, the company became a joint venture with longtime partner Saban Entertainment and was renamed to Fox Kids Worldwide. The next year, the company purchased The Family Channel and its parent company, International Family Entertainment, and turned it into Fox Family, forming Fox Family Worldwide; however, Fox Kids Worldwide continued to be operated as an in-name-only unit for distribution of shows as well as producing programs, by this point all Fox Kids original programming from that period was produced and/or licensed by Saban. In 2001, due to the network not performing well, Fox Family and Saban were sold to Disney; this left Fox Kids, now back in the News Corporation's hands, without a big portion of their programming. With this, plus them struggling with the changing scene of children's television with other Saturday blocks and cable channels outranking them in the ratings, and affiliates wanting to use the daytime hours used by the block for their own programs, Fox discontinued the weekly block and put the remaining Saturday morning timeslot up for bidding, with 4Kids Entertainment winning and securing the rights to program that period. The Fox Kids block continued to air in repeats until September 7, 2002, and was replaced the following week (on September 14) by the 4Kids-programmed FoxBox (later renamed 4Kids TV); Fox Kids Worldwide was then closed.\n\nMost of the Fox Kids library, including the parts of the Marvel Productions and New World Animation libraries not co-produced by Sunbow, was purchased by Disney along with Fox Family in 2001.\n\nFox Children's Productions\n\n1st Logo (September 8, 1990-November 13, 1993)\n\nVisuals: On a purple and black gradient background is the name \"FOX CHILDREN'S PRODUCTIONS\" in gold in its 20th Century Fox font.\"FOX\" is n a big big font on top, \"CHILDREN'S\" is in the middle in a smaller size, and \"PRODUCTIONS\" is at the bottom in the same font size. A slow shining wipe effect appears on the logo.\n\nVariant: A still version exists.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio:\n\nNone or the ending theme of the show.\n\nOn at least one episode of Bobby's World, the logo uses the 1989 music from both the 1981 20th Century Fox Television and 1992 20th Television logos, most likely due to a production error.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on Eek! Stravaganza's first and half of its second season (prior to the premiere of The Terrible Thunderlizards segments), Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!, Bobby's World, and Fox's Peter Pan & the Pirates among others.\n\nThe first two haven't aired on TV in nearly two decades, and the last one has long since faded into obscurity.\n\nThe third and seventh episodes of Eek! Stravaganza have been released on VHS however, so this logo should be left intact.\n\nIt is also intact on Bobby's World on Netflix and select DVD-R releases.\n\n2nd Logo (September 18, 1993-March 3, 1998)\n\nVisuals: On a white background are silhouettes of a film reel and film tape. On top of the background is the word \"fox\" continuously changing colors, with searchlights behind it. Under the \"fox\" searchlights we see a zigzagged line with \"children's productions\" under it.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the show or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nThe Tick had a slamming sound.\n\nOn the first season of The Fox Cubhouse, this logo contains giggling from a child.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on season 2 of The Tick, which is also available on DVD and was last seen on Toon Disney's Jetix block (now Disney XD) (as a side note, Jetix is what Fox Kids eventually became in 2004, during its first two years on ABC Family, it had no proper name and was known simply as the \"ABC Family Action Block\").\n\nIt is also seen on Life with Louie, seasons 2-5 of Eek! Stravaganza, Bobby's World (preserved on Amazon Prime), and The Tick (preserved on Hulu).\n\nOn Life with Louie reruns on the North American Fox Kids block from 1999 until 2002, this logo was plastered by the 1998-2000 Fox Family Productions logo, due to Fox Kids using a Fox Family print.\n\nFox Kids Worldwide\n\n1st Logo (February 1, 1997-1999)\n\nVisuals: On a space background is the Earth. Then the Earth rapidly gets \"sucked\" in to reveal that the globe is in a kid's eye. The camera then zooms out to reveal a bunch of kids faces with the 1997 Fox Kids logo in the middle of the screen, which consists of the red text \"FOX KIDS\" stacked in front of a black square, with two yellow searchlights in place of the \"X\" in \"FOX\". Behind \"FOX KIDS\" are red rectangles that shake, and two yellow searchlights sway at the top, all of which give it an intentionally \"messy\" appearance, and below \"FOX KIDS\" is the white Ad Lib text \"worldwide\".\n\nTrivia: This logo ties into the \"Fox Kids Rocks Kids\" branding used from spring 1997 to summer 1998, though the logo was still used until 1999.\n\nTechnique: Computer animation.\n\nAudio: A whoosh and a swish sound, then a fast-paced drumbeat.\n\nAudio Variant: Sometimes on some shows, the ending theme plays over it instead.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on several newer programs from Fox and Saban from the time, such as Saban's Adventures of Oliver Twist, Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation and The New Addams Family, among others.\n\nShows from before 1997 that were still producing new episodes at the time kept the second logo (like Eek! Stravaganza).\n\nThe easiest place to find this is on R1 DVD releases of Goosebumps released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.\n\nHowever, it does not appear on most VHS releases of it, as for whatever reason, the 1992 20th Television logo is used instead; however, some VHS releases like One Day at Horrorland have this logo at the end.\n\nIt was also spotted on some later prints of older shows like Dennis the Menace and Robocop: The Animated Series, respectively.\n\nThe logo was also seen on reruns of shows on the now-defunct Jetix Play channel in Europe.\n\nIt was also seen on several episodes of Spider-Man: The Animated Series, X-Men, and the 1996 version of The Incredible Hulk on Disney XD.\n\n2nd Logo (October 9, 1999-2003)\n\nVisuals: The 1998 \"FOX KIDS\" logo (which consists of the words; in which the \"X\" in \"FOX\" is two yellow searchlights crossing, a reference to the searchlights in the 20th Century Fox logo and rest of the letters are in red) spins around several times while white circles behind it enlarge and disappear, as if they're being transmitted by a radio tower.\n\nTrivia: The rotating logo and a voice-over are based on the 1998-99 bumpers from the Fox Kids block.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A robotic voice-over saying \"Fox Kids!\" over and over with beeping noises in the background.\n\nAudio Variant: On a Russian dubbing print of the Dennis the Menace episode \"A Froggy Day/Loch Ness Mess/Box Office Smash\", the 1997 fanfare from the previous logo is heard.\n\nAvailability: This logo was mainly used by Fox Kids Europe.\n\nSeen on several Saban-dubbed anime shows from the period on the Fox Kids block, such as Flint the Time Detective, DinoZaurs, Mon Colle Knights, and Digimon (the first three seasons).\n\nSome Transformers: Robots in Disguise episodes only end with this logo, without the preceding 1996 Saban logo.\n\nNewer western animated shows from Saban and/or Fox Kids Europe such as The Kids from Room 402, Jim Button, the first and early prints of the second season of What's with Andy?, and Pigs Next Door all had this logo, among others.\n\nIt is also seen on late-1990s prints of Saban-owned material, normally with the 1996 Saban International logo preceding.\n\nAs such, this logo is seen on King Arthur and the Knights of Justice, and DIC programs such as Dennis the Menace.\n\nFox Family Channel reruns of Inspector Gadget also had this logo, in Gadget's case, following the DIC logo. These prints turned up time to time on This TV.\n\nThe BCI Eclipse DVD set of the 1983 Dungeons and Dragons animated series has this combo as well.\n\nSome late season 8 episodes of Bobby's World on Kabillion on Demand have this logo, as well as some season 3 episodes on select DVD-R releases.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of the pilot episode of The Incredible Hulk (1966 animated series), included on the UK DVD release of The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Series: Marvel Originals Series: 60s from Liberation Entertainment, following the 1996 Saban International logo.\n\n3rd Logo (February 9-August 24, 2002)\n\nVisuals: On a red background with some yellow \"stars\", the 2002 Fox Kids logo (which consists of an all yellow version of the 1998 logo in a yellow circle) is seen in the center of the screen. The words \"in association with\" is seen above it. There also seems to be a comet behind the Fox Kids logo.\n\nTrivia: This logo was based on Fox Kids's short-lived branding from February 9-September 7, 2002, as well as Fox's on-air branding from the 2001-2002 TV season.\n\nTechnique: A still, digital graphic.\n\nAudio: The end theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: It was only seen on Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension, which hasn't been re-aired in years and also does not have any sort of VHS or DVD release."
