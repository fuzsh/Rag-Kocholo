        "text": "Sorry for off-topic, but, we made a topic where we can talk about the missing Fox Kids/Jetix programming on Disney+, you can check it there:\n\nDisney+ and the missing Fox Kids/Jetix library\n\nIn 1995, Saban Entertainment and Fox Kids merged to form Fox Family Worldwide. During this merger, New World Animation/Marvel Productions was purchased and the Saban-Fox partnership acquired Marvel's entire archive of cartoons produced between the 1966 to 1997. (Except Fantastic Four '68 and The...\n\nOh! thank god. (If there is a god, of course.) Finally someone is doing something about it. I welcome the idea of splitting into two issues. While we can talk about the technical details, timelines and promotions of the channels on this subject, the other subject we will be able to share our favorite moments, memories, sections from the series, and fan-made works. I think it's been great.\n\nWhich Fox Kids Europe feeds had Digimon and what of it they aired:\n\nUK: Adventure, 02, and Tamers. Frontier never aired but was planned\n\nNetherlands: At least Adventure and 02 aired. I think Tamers did too since I remember seeing a Christmas promo from Fox Kids NL (or was it Scandinavia?) where Henry appeared, but Frontier definitely didn't\n\nScandinavia: Adventure and 02\n\nSpain: Adventure and Frontier\n\nGermany: Aired at least Tamers\n\nFrance: Adventure, 02, Tamers\n\nItaly: Did have Digimon, but don't know which seasons?\n\nPoland: Adventure only\n\nIsrael: Adventure, 02, Tamers, and Frontier\n\nEven though Savers debuted while Jetix still existed, no Jetix Europe channel picked up on it (Jetix UK did rerun Tamers around the same time Savers was airing on Toon Disney in the US). It was owned by Toei rather than Saban/Disney\n\nI think that's porky pies mate the UK aired stuff like Ace Ventura, Starla and the Jewel Riders, The Mask, Flint, Sailormoon hack n slashed Sailor Says whilst ITV showed it, Digimon Monsters Digimon Are The Champions, version and other so called not UK shows during my 1996-2000 ISH era stuff we just don't have a single schedule of but we remember from memory's.\n\nIf they aired it before you started watching should have asked an oldie about the truth of Digimon I even think the music changed and I quit watching because it's normally a bad sign by it was still going then.\n\nIn fact the channel existed before it existed in the UK as DJ Kat and The Children's Channel and when Fox Kids started DJ Kat died and everything Fox Kids acquired other than it's own branded Izonbard left TCC part by part after the series run ended until December 1998 when the TCC schedule went all English almost with the assets completely removed.\n\n1997 and onwards I remember Sky One's portion of Fox Kids reopening when Fox Kids was cram packed in schedule to support all it's stuff like Fox's airing rights for later D'Con like Pocket Dragons, late DIC Mummies Alive in the LP part of DIC where Disney or Star is the Limited Partner and DIC or Cookie Jar is the owner and then you also had their 4Kids Entertainment distribution rights block and that was the purpose of Sky One since a Fox Kids ground for those with no room to air.\n\nUS history was interesting but my UK history was even more interesting because you had DJ Kat and The Children's Channel and then DJ Kat came back unnamed as a dumping ground like a Jetix Play for shows that couldn't fit the schedule which they considered the smaller shows.\n\nThe UK version during 1996-2000 also had so many lisences which Disney needs to resign to content distribution deals again."
