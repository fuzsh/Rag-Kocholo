        "text": "Now that the Walt Disney Company has finished its acquisition of substantial parts of 21st Century Fox, what does it own exactly?\n\nThe chart below offers an updated look at the far-reaching tentacles of Disney, from its newly-acquired Fox companies to household names like Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar, to smaller and lesser-known brands, all of which exist under the same massive umbrella.\n\nIn case the chart is too much of a labyrinth, here are some important points to focus on:\n\nThrough the Fox purchase, Disney acquired important companies like Fox Family and Fox Animation, Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures, and Fox 2000 Pictures; Fox’s television creative units, Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions, and Fox21; FX Networks; National Geographic Partners; Fox Networks Group International; Star India; and Fox’s interests in Hulu, Tata Sky, and Endemol Shine Group shows.\n\nThese are the most recognizable companies Disney owns entirely or partially: ESPN (80% stake), Touchstone Pictures, Marvel, Lucasfilm, A&E (50% equity holding with Hearst Corporation), The History Channel (50% equity holding with Hearst Corporation), Lifetime (50% equity holding with Hearst Corporation), Pixar, Hollywood Records, and Vice Media (16% stake). Of course, this list also includes all of the obvious properties like the Disney-branded television channels, radio stations, stores, and parks.\n\nThese are the some of the major brands and franchises Disney owns: Star Wars, The Muppets, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Disney Princesses, Pirates of the Caribbean, Pixar films, Winnie the Pooh, and Indiana Jones.\n\nThese are some lesser-known companies and networks owned or co-owned by Disney: Maker Studios, the venture capital firm Steamboat Ventures, international media networks such as ATV, RTL 2, RDS, Tele 5, and Kividoo, Earth Star Inc, and Synergy Group, to name a few.\n\nDisney now also owns shows and films such as The Simpsons, American Horror Story, American Idol, and Family Guy, as well as movies like Home Alone, Avatar, Deadpool, Die Hard, Night at the Museum, and Independence Day. It also owns classic Fox films like All About Eve, Cleopatra, MASH, Alien, and The Thin Red Line, among hundreds of others.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Disney-Fox merger, Disney’s biggest competitors are Comcast-NBCUniversal (which owns Universal Studios, Illumination, and Dreamworks Animation), National Amusements (owner of Paramount Pictures and Viacom Media Networks, which is the parent of Nickelodeon and MTV), and Warnermedia (which houses Warner Bros. Studios, HBO, the CW, DC Comics, and Cartoon Network, among other companies)."
