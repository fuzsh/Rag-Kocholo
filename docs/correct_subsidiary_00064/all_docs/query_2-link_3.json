        "text": "If you were a kid in the late 90s and very early 2000s, and your parents couldn't afford to pay for cable tv (which meant no Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, or Cartoon Network). Then aside from PBS's edutainment fare and whatever syndicated shows and blocks that local tv stations were able to grab up, there were two networks just for you.\n\nThere was Kids' WB!. The kid-targeted arm of the former WB network that aired 14-hours of children's entertainment a week (Mon-Fri afternoons, and Saturday mornings) on WB affiliates, until 2005 when it switched to a Saturday-only block before being dissolved entirely in 2008. Being home to of course, Warner Bros. and DC-owned properties like Looney Tunes, Batman, Superman, and Pinky & The Brain, as well as a host of anime and action cartoon series such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Jackie Chan Adventures, and X-Men Evolution.\n\nAnd then there was the Fox Kids Network. Initially a unit of the FOX Broadcasting Co., before becoming part of Fox Family Worldwide (owned in partnership between Fox and Haim Saban) until its sale to Disney in 2001. A similar 14-hour-a-week block that was home to X-Men, the initial run of B:TAS, Bobby's World, The Tick, Goosebumps. It later became known for the Power Rangers franchise as well as off-beat Canadian shows and anime such as Digimon, Cybersix, Action Man, The Ripping Friends, and Medabots.\n\nIronically, the remains of both Fox Kids and Kids' WB were taken over by 4Kids in 2002 and 2008 respectively.\n\nBetween the two, which network was your go-to for kids programing if you didn't have cable (or did have cable, but still wanted to watch saturday moring cartoons anyway).\n\nWe had cable so I watched mainly cartoon network and nickelodeon (not disney channel, really didn't like disney much as a kid or adult).\n\nThat said I regularly watched kids wb. I would always get up early to watch kids wb every Saturday morning.Loved seeing Batman Beyond, Pokémon, Jackie Chan Adventures, Xiaolon Showdown, Static Shock, etc.\n\nFox Kids, I really don't have vivid memories of that. I really didn't watch much power rangers or digimon as a kid (a few episodes here and there randomly, but not consistently).\n\nI definitely watched a bunch of 90s Warner stuff as a kid. Shows like: Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, pinky and the brain, freakazoid!, batman the animated series, superman the animated series. Some of those were on fox kids before moving to kids wb and cartoon network for reruns. Not sure we're I watched some of them bit I definitely remember them.\n\nTiny Toon Adventures definitely started in first run syndication because there was an episode were buster and babs announced they were now on the fox network (and proceeded to be chased by foxes)."
