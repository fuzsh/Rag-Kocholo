        "text": "\"By acquiring sources of new content, Disney has been able to dramatically bolster its media library. Coupled with its formidable marketing arm, Disney utilises these new franchises to maximise corporate revenue.\"\n\nToday the Walt Disney brand inspires magic and excitement amongst children and adults alike. Valued at $170 billion (Market Cap, October 2018), the Walt Disney Corporation continues to capture our imagination through its theme parks, animation and feature films, television shows, video games and its ever expanding suite of merchandise.\n\nLike most successful companies, Disney expands a significant proportion of its bottom-line by growing organically, from releasing new features (such as the upcoming Ralph Breaks the Internet) to expanding its parks (such as the new Shanghai Resort and Toy Story Land at Hollywood Studios). The Walt Disney Company is also especially gifted at growing externally. By acquiring sources of new content, Disney has been able to dramatically bolster its media library. Coupled with its formidable marketing arm, Mickey Mouse utilises these new franchises to maximise corporate revenue.\n\nTypically acquisitions are difficult. CEOs can often be quick to acquire new firms as they look to establish their legacy and enter new chapters under their lineage. Statistically 70-90% of all acquisitions fail (Harvard Business Review 2015) as new operating groups are unable to adjust to a new culture and ways or working. This is however not the case for Disney which is able to pull off multiple triumphs and bounce from strength to strength. Let’s take a look at some the key examples of how Disney has successfully extended its media portfolio.\n\nPixar (2006, $7.4 billion)\n\nPixar began in 1979 under Lucasfilm before its spin-out as a corporation in 1986. With funding from Steve Jobs, Pixar made a historic $26 million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first featuring a cowboy and space ranger by the names of Woody and Buzz. Following a string of blockbuster hits, including A Bugs Life and Monsters Inc, Disney purchased Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion. Today its feature films have earned approximately $13 billion at the worldwide box office, with an average worldwide gross of $659.7 million per film. Finding Nemo (2003), along with its sequel Finding Dory (2016), Toy Story 3 (2010) and Incredibles 2 (2018) are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time.\n\nMarvel (2009, $4 billion)\n\nFrom Spiderman to Captain America, Marvel Entertainment has a long-history of popular franchises starring across comics, animation, television and feature films. Over the years, Marvel Entertainment has entered into several partnerships and negotiations with other companies across a variety of businesses, including Sony, Fox and Universal, often in a last ditch attempt to avoid bankruptcy. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. Following the acquisition, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed $17.5 billion worldwide, following film releases such as Iron Man, Avengers Assemble and Black Panther, and has also launched a string of successful TV series on Netflix and ABC.\n\nLucas Film (2012, $4 billion)\n\nThe studio is best known for creating and producing the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971. Under Lucas, the Star Wars series alone grossed $4.4 billion as well as an impressive portfolio of Star Wars themed TV series and video games. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in December 2012 for $2.2 billion in cash and $1.855 billion in stock. Since then, Disney has released four new Star Wars movies grossing $925 million with future releases planned for Star Wars Episode IX (2019) and Indiana Jones 5 (2021). Star Wars Land is also due to open its doors in Hollywood Studios in 2019.\n\nABC & ESPN (1995, $19 billion)\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that has a rich history of successful shows, with hits such as Lost, Once Upon a Time, Desperate Housewives and Grey’s Anatomy. ABC originally launched as a radio network in 1943, later diversifying into television and sports (following its gradual acquisition of ESPN in the 1980’s). In 1995, The Walt Disney Company announced an agreement to merge with ABC for $19 billion providing Disney with new reach and expertise across news, television and sport platforms.\n\nMuppets (2004, $75 million)\n\nThe Muppets were created by puppeteer Jim Henson in the 1950s, beginning with Kermit the Frog, who would become Henson's signature character. Henson saw the Muppets shoot to fame with The Muppet Show and then a string of theater releases. The first conversations on a Disney takeover took place during the late 1980s however, following the death of Jim Henson in 1990, negotiations stopped. Fourteen years after initial negotiations began, Disney purchased the Muppet intellectual properties from the Jim Henson Company for $75 million in 2004. By 2011, the Muppets were featured in a seventh film, intended to serve as a \"creative reboot\" for the characters. Since then, Disney has released an eighth film and plans a further reboot in 2019 for the new Disney Streaming Service.\n\n21st Century Fox (Pending, $71 billion)\n\nCurrently the United States' fourth-largest media conglomerate, 21st Century Fox is the legal successor to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation dealing primarily in the film and television industries. 21st Century Fox is the latest acquisition target for Disney which would not only massively extend its media library but also has the potential to dramatically bolster its plans for the upcoming Disney Streaming Service. In July 2018, 21st Century Fox shareholders agreed to sell the company to The Walt Disney Company for $71.3 billion, which will include key assets such as 20th Century Fox, FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, and its international networks. The purchase is expected to be completed in 2019. It received U.S. antitrust approval in June 2018, and is currently awaiting approval by international regulators."
