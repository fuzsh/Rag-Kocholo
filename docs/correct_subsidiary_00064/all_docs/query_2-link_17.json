        "text": "Fox Kids Europe is to lose its name after media giant Walt Disney snapped up its parent network.\n\nThe US group confirmed that the channel, which reaches more than 24m subscribers across, will undergo a Disney makeover.\n\nFox Kids Europe is part of the Fox Family Worldwide children's TV network, which has frustrated owner Rupert Murdoch with low ratings and a disappointing financial performance.\n\nThe rebranding process will be part of Disney's attempt to boost the European arm of the business.\n\nMichael Eisner, the chief executive of Disney, said today's £3.7bn deal will open up the group to an even bigger global audience.\n\nFox Family Worldwide includes the Fox Family Channel, which has 81m subscribers and will be renamed ABC Family when it is brought into Disney's ABC network.\n\n\"This acquisition strengthens our company's worldwide business of family entertainment. The Family Channel and Fox Kids are unique assets that are particularly well suited to be a part of The Walt Disney Company,\" said Mr Eisner.\n\nThe deal with Mr Murdoch's News Corporation and co-owner Saban Entertainment will see Disney pay a total of £2.1bn in cash and take on around £1.4bn in debt."
