        "text": "Now under Disney ownership, Fox Kids Europe (FKE) has announced that Buena Vista International Television (BVI-TV), a division of The Walt Disney Company, will service distribution for FKE's Saban library beginning May 1, 2002. The Saban library contains more than 6,300 episodes of children's programming including major franchises such as SPIDER-MAN, POWER RANGERS, X-MEN, DIGIMON, THE INCREDIBLE HULK and INSPECTOR GADGET. FKE owns the television rights in Europe and the Middle East to all children's programming in the Saban library. BVI-TV will service FKE's program distribution activities to third party broadcasters on substantially the same terms as FKE's previous agreement with Saban as well as handling distribution for all rights to the Saban library not owned by FKE, including rights outside of Europe and the Middle East. C21 MEDIA reported that at this year's MIP-TV, BVI-TV's senior vice president Tom Toumazis emphasized how the addition of Saban's kids programming makes Buena Vista International Television the worlds biggest distributor of childrens product. He also mentioned that Saban and FKE will be rebranded. \"It wont happen overnight and there's no rush,\" Toumazis told C21, \"but we will change the name.\""
