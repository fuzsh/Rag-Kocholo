        "text": "Could you give some examples to us?\n\nTubi is free ads supported streaming service that has a lot of acquired shows that remind me of Netflix in old days. Tubi is expanding to other countries but not sure if contents would be same in all countries.\n\nKids Shows\n\nWatch free kids shows movies and TV shows online in HD on any device. Tubi offers streaming kids shows movies and tv you will love.\n\nTubi is not available outside the United States.\n\nTubi is available in numbers of other countries - Australia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico, Panama, Canada and several others. They are expanding to oversea market.\n\nIf Disney can't do this, they should get out of the streaming service business.\n\nOk, Disney cares about how many are subscribers and they want to compete with Netflix directly. If Disney don't see old shows as worth to justifying the subscription growth, so they wouldn't be priority to get added quickly.\n\nSad to tell - streaming services aren't place that you want access to all contents.\n\nIf it wasn't for Disney+, there are a lot of old shows would be stuck in the vault and they are less likely to be license out, even most of their shows weren't carried on Netflix when they were peak (amount of contents, not subscribers) in 2011-2012.\n\nThere are more Disney shows on YouTube than Disney+. So why does the service called Disney+ exist?\n\nMost of Disney shows (beside shorts) on YouTube aren't legit since Disney+ is legit place to access, despite not all old shows are available.\n\nMPA, formerly MPAA is getting more intense with anti-piracy as they expand their influence to oversea.\n\nI realized this thread is strictly discuss about missing shows on Disney+ and I thought Tubi would be preferred alternative. Let go back on topic about missing shows on Disney+.\n\nThe interface is very complicated dude, I just didn't see it among the subsidiaries listed. I don't know how to read those reports.\n\nUS government makes harder for ordinary readers to understand the report, also I took business courses at college and I still can’t understand the SEC report fully. Other reason is Disney’s fault because they didn’t make a clear.\n\nHow? Wikipedia says it was independent and had no ties to BVS Entertainment after 2001. But as you say, Saban never owned 100% of the company and Disney only owned 100%. I was as happy as seeing an old friend. But at the same time, I was confused.\n\nHey! What's wrong with Wikipedia? Previous information has been changed. It says it is now a defunct subsidiary of BVS.\n\nWikipedia is notorious for inaccuracies and there are some people vandalized the page to put inaccurate information on page. Wikipedia is user submitted encyclopedia but there are many moderators to do all checks and review the citation. You can edit the Wikipedia to put information or fix to make a better fact.\n\nI remembered BVS when Jetix was around but I forgot after Disney abandoned it, right after rebrand as Disney XD. I still call BVS as Saban. Disney got complicated and confusing history with animation companies."
