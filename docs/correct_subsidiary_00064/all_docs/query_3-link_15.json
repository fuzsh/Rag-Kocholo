The Walt Disney\n\nCompany continues to bring joy and happiness to its consumers around the globe, and\n\nwould never stop surprising us with its visions.\n\n1. 1 Introduction\n\nBehind all the wonders that Disney has brought us, are the visionaries of\n\nDisney’s leadership team who strive to generate creativity, foster innovation, and\n\nutilize the latest technologies. Disney is a multinational, cross-platform conglomerate.\n\nTheir business flourish in many different domains, including parks and resorts,\n\nconsumer products, studio entertainment, media networks, and interactive media. The\n\ncompany is currently operating in more than 40 countries, and they really have taken\n\nissues such as labor, ethics, environment, philanthropy and etc., very seriously.\n\n1.2 Choosing Disney\n\nUpon deciding what case we want to explore in this class, we struggled quite a\n\nbit trying to come up with something that is well-known but not cliché. Our eyes lit\n\nup when spotting a group member’s t-shirt that has a cartoon character on it: it was\n\nDale, from “Chip n Dale” the Disney cartoon chipmunks. When we think of business\n\ncases we often think of products and their brands, such as H&M in the fashion\n\nindustry, or Apple in the consumer electronics industry; rarely do we think of the\n\nentertainment industry. We chose to look into Disney because it has been part of our,\n\nif not everyone’s childhood. Those classic fairytales and adventures taught us about\n\nlove, about courage, and about faith. Furthermore, like we do, Disney matures\n\novertime, bringing more diversity and innovation into its works, connecting and\n\nbringing happiness to people of different generations.\n\n1.3 Facts and Statistics\n\nThe rich backstory of Disney could not be easily simplified into a few pages of\n\nwriting, therefore certain facts and statistics that we found important to illustrate this\n\ncompany has been cherry-picked and listed below.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n9 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n1.3.1 Company\n\n■ Founding Date: October 16, 1923 (93 years ago)\n\n■ Products: Theme parks, cable television, films, publishing, broadcasting,\n\nradio, web portals, music, video games\n\n■ Number of employees: 180,000 (2014)\n\n■ Net income: US$8.38 billion (2015)\n\n■ Total assets: US$88.18 billion (2015)\n\n1.3.2 Divisions:\n\n■ Walt Disney Parks and Resorts\n\n─ Featuring the company's theme parks, cruise line, and other\n\ntravel-related assets\n\n■ Walt Disney Studios\n\n─ Includes the company's film, music recording label, and theatrical\n\ndivisions.\n\n■ Disney Media Networks\n\n─ Includes the company's television properties.\n\n■ Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media\n\n─ Produces toys, clothing, and other merchandising based upon\n\nDisney-owned properties, as well as including Disney's Internet,\n\nmobile, social media, virtual worlds, and computer games operations.\n\n1.3.3 Subsidiaries\n\n■ Walt Disney Studios\n\n■ Walt Disney Animation Studios\n\n■ Disney Theatrical Productions\n\n■ The Walt Disney Company India\n\n■ Pixar Animation Studios\n\n■ Marvel Entertainment\n\n■ Marvel Studios\n\n■ Lucasfilm\n\n■ The Muppets Studio\n\n■ Disney–ABC Television Group\n\n■ ESPN Inc.

However,\n\nDisney operates in many aspects of entertainment, including amusement parks, TV\n\nchannels, consumer products, movies, and so on. We chose to study about Disney’s\n\nparks and resorts in further detail, making this segment of the Disney entertainment\n\nkingdom our focus in this course.\n\nFigure 1. Strategic Level\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n11 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n2.1 Disney’s Corporate Level Strategy\n\nAs we have introduced in previous passages, Disney’s businesses flourish in\n\ndifferent aspects of entertainment industries, its divisions include: Walt Disney Parks\n\nand Resorts, Walt Disney Studios, Disney Media Networks, and Disney Consumer\n\nProducts and Interactive Media. Despite their differences in operation, the core of\n\nthese businesses are united, that is Disney’s mission statement.\n\nDISNEY'S MISSION STATEMENT\n\n\"The mission of The Walt Disney Company is to be one of the world's leading\n\nproducers and providers of entertainment and information. Using our portfolio of\n\nbrands to differentiate our content, services and consumer products, we seek to\n\ndevelop the most creative, innovative and profitable entertainment experiences and\n\nrelated products in the world.\"\n\nThese words, carefully chosen, summed up the Disney’s vision as an\n\nentertainment tycoon. Everything that its business units carry out aim to realize\n\nDisney’s mission statement.\n\n2.2 Disney’s Business Level Strategy\n\nWalt Disney Parks and Resorts is one of Disney’s most profitable business units,\n\ncurrently operating in six different locations around the world, including California,\n\nFlorida, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. When it came to expanding\n\noverseas, entering international markets, Disney did more than just copy its success at\n\nhome. Instead, based on past experiences and conditions of the hosting country,\n\nDisney went with one of two ways: licensing or joint venture. Disney licensed its\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n12 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nbrand to a Japanese company called Oriental Land Company, Disney had not been\n\ninvolved in operation, only did they receive royalties and parts of Tokyo Disney\n\nResort’s (TDR) revenue in return. Whereas in Paris, Hong Kong, and Shanghai,\n\nDisney chose to collaborate with local entities and run its business in the form of joint\n\nventure. Due to these different strategies, different functional level strategies were\n\nthen sketched out and performed.\n\n2.3 Disney’s Functional Level Strategies\n\n2.3.1 Research and Development\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nAccording to the financial report posted on Disney official website, people can\n\nknow that Disney Company had invested in park and resorts more and more for R&D\n\neach year until now. As a result, it is obvious that they really put emphasis on\n\nResearch and Development this part to meet this changing world.\n\nThe financial report for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\n\nTable 1. The financial report for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013\n\nThe main capital expenditures for the Parks and Resorts are expansion, new\n\nattractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n13 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nincrease capital expenditure in domestic parks and resorts was to construct new\n\nattractions in Walt Disney World Resort. While the higher capital expenditures are in\n\ninternational park and resorts are due to the construction of Shanghai Disney Resort.\n\n2.3.2 Human Resource\n\nThe strategy of Human resource in Disney Park and Resorts is one of the factors\n\nmake them such success. They have standard operation procedure when hiring,\n\ntraining, and encouraging their employees. When recruiting new employees, the first\n\npriority is “attitude”, then their skills.\n\nThey like to talk about the worst situation at first. Before job seekers applied the\n\nrecruitment form, they were asked to see a video, which illustrate the company's\n\nculture and practices. For example, they have to work on weekends, holidays and at\n\nnight. For another example, they have strict restrictions on clothing. They can’t even\n\nunveil their tattoo when they are working.\n\nBesides, Disney asks supervisors humble themselves. When the receptionist on\n\nthe front line are busy, those supervisors will assist them directly. They can do\n\neverything from sell popcorns to even put the merchandise on the shelfs. From an\n\naspect of the company, there are three benefits when they doing so. Firstly, supervisor\n\nshare responsibility of workload with staff. Secondly, front line workers know that\n\ncompany pay high attention on their works. Thirdly, supervisors could have chance to\n\ninteract with customers directly.\n\n2.3.3 Finance\n\nOwns and operates:\n\n Walt Disney World Resort in Florida\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n14 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n Disneyland Resort in California\n\nManages and has effective ownership interests:\n\n 81% in Disneyland Paris (recapitalization)\n\n 47% in Hong Kong Disneyland Resort\n\n 43% in Shanghai Disney Resort\n\nLicenses intellectual property to a third party for the operations:\n\n Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan\n\n2.3.4 Marketing\n\nDisney puts a lot of emphasis on marketing to continually attract visitors. The\n\nfollowing were what they effort:\n\nEmbrace New Technology\n\nThe park has always been quick to embrace technological advantages, like\n\nlaunching an app to keep visitors informed, or their new MagicBands wearables.\n\nUse Data to Inform Decisions\n\nThe MagicBand provides tracking data on all of the park’s guests, which allows\n\nDisneyland to optimize everything from staffing to the location of a food vendor.\n\nOptimize User Experience\n\nDisney always consider customer experience and work to streamline the process\n\nof purchasing, using, and servicing product.\n\nBalance Accessibility with Exclusivity\n\nDesign a way to make customers feel special, and they will respond with\n\ncustomer loyalty.\n\nDeliver Unexpected Moments of Magic\n\nDisneyland capitalizes on this affinity with live characters, surprise performances,\n\nparades, and exceptional customer service. Making an effort to surprise and\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n15 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\ndelight customers at every turn will always pay dividends.\n\n2.3.5 Tokyo Disney Resort\n\nAging trends in Japan has led to a decrease in TDR’s targeting market, TDR had\n\nto find new ways to appeal to potential customers other than children and young\n\nadults, their original target customers. In order to maintain attendance of its parks and\n\nresorts, TDR attempted to motivate the Japanese population of forty or above, and\n\ndefined these people as “New Age”. The “New Age Marketing” targeted guests that\n\nage forty to sixty, promoting that Disney’s parks were not just for kids or young adults.\n\nA separate online homepage called “Disney for Adults” was set up, promoting the 45+\n\nPassport to adults. This passport features services that aimed to bring a more\n\ncustomized entertainment experience to its adult users. Tokyo Disney Sea (TDS) was\n\nalso built to provide a more “grown-up experience” for Tokyo Disney’s older\n\ncustomers, where they would be less surrounded by “cuteness” such as Mickey Mouse\n\nor its fellow characters.\n\nMid-Long Term Strategies\n\nTDR had planned out its future strategies, surrounding its core plan of\n\nmaintaining a theme park attendance figure of 30 million guest per year. To achieve\n\nthat number, TDR aimed to “build stronger family entertainment” and “increase guest\n\ncomfort”. Budgets and plans were invested and planned out to be carried out through\n\nthe next decade.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n16 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nChapter 3 Strategic Map\n\nThe main objective of Disney Parks and Resort is to create happiness for their\n\nguests, which is supported by three goals: guest experience, telling stories, and family\n\nentertainment.\n\nFigure 2. Strategic Map\n\n3.1 Guest Experience\n\n● Meet and exceed the needs of customers\n\n+ Customer loyalty: loyalty is generated through increasing customer\n\nsatisfaction\n\n+ Customizing: customizing customer service allows Disney to meet the\n\ndifferent needs of its different customers: parents or children, young or\n\nelder, and etc.\n\n+ Employee training\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n17 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n▪ Regulations\n\n▪ SOP\n\n▪ Attitude: Disney makes sure that its employees share the same\n\nattitude and values as the company\n\n▪ Value sharing\n\n▪ Workload sharing: managers would supervise and help with the\n\nwork of other employees, even if it is selling hotdogs or picking\n\nup trash. It all comes down to providing guests the best\n\nexperience in the parks.\n\n+ High quality service standard\n\n● Comfortable surroundings\n\n+ Cleaning staff\n\n+ Stroller guy: One simple yet thoughtful service makes guests more\n\ncomfortable\n\n● Attendance control: In order to provide the guests with the best Disney\n\nexperience, Disney controls attendance number. In which the guest could be\n\ncomfortable with the park space, service quality, and plentiful time to enjoy.\n\n+ Ticket price management: The price is much higher than other\n\namusement parks, especially in hot seasons. Additional payments may\n\nbe needed for premium services.\n\n+ Special passports: some passports allows guests to enjoy the rides\n\nwithout having to wait in the long queues.\n\n● Data Collection\n\n● Embrace new technology\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n18 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n3.2 Telling Stories\n\n● Deliver unexpected moments of magic: For example, Disney characters may\n\nshow up to entertain the guests in queues, creating an element of surprise.\n\n● Consumer merchandise\n\n● Live characters\n\n● Setting atmosphere\n\n+ Infrastructure\n\n+ Background music\n\n+ Restaurant (and food) designs\n\n3.3 Family Entertainment\n\n● Renew themes and rides\n\n+ Creativity\n\n+ Purchasing popular franchises: Disney acquired popular franchises\n\nsuch as Marvel and Star Wars, which they can now build new\n\ntheme-based rides to attract more guests.\n\n● Parades\n\n● Stage shows\n\n● Photo services\n\n● Cruise trips\n\n● Accessible environment\n\n● Customize packages\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n19 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nChapter 4 Five Forces Analysis\n\nBuilding on the previous parts we have discussed on Disney’s theme park\n\nsegment, Disney Park and Resorts, we continue to look into this case with a critical\n\neye. Using Porter’s five forces analysis, we studied what kind of external threats that\n\nDisney might have encountered, or would come across in the future. By understanding\n\nmore about the industrial environment, the business is in, it helps the company to\n\nnavigate its way towards sustainability and success.\n\nFigure 3 Five Forces Analysis\n\n4.1 Industrial Rivalry\n\nFor Disney Parks and Resorts, there are four main rivalry in the amusement park\n\nindustry, they are Universal Parks and Resorts, Cedar Fair, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, and\n\nMerlin Entertainment. These amusement parks are located mainly in the US, some\n\nexpanded abroad globally like Disney itself. Disney also competes with local theme\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n20 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nparks in locations outside USA, such as China.\n\nEach of these parks tried to out-perform their competitors in order to attract new\n\ncustomers and keep their old customers coming back. Ticket prices of these parks do\n\nnot differ much from one another, so it would be the differences in themes and\n\nexperiences that makes them unique in their own way. New attractions, rides,\n\ninfrastructures and restaurants are the keys to making that “sprint” to be head in the\n\ngame. For example, Universal added the Harry Potter franchise, the Wizarding World\n\nof Harry Potter, into its parks, and its customer visits sky-rocketed. This success of\n\nUniversal stimulated Disney’s expansion of its Magic Kingdom which began in 2012,\n\nover one billion US dollar was invested in order for Disney to maintain its leading\n\nposition in the theme park industry.\n\nThat being said, Disney Parks and Resorts generate astronomical revenues every\n\nyear. As the chart shows, not even if all of its competitors’ revenue added together\n\ncould come close to Disney’s massive success. In general, the bargaining power of\n\nDisney’s rivalry would be seen as medium.\n\nFigure 4. Disney Industrial Rivalry\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n21 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n4.2 Threat of Substitutes\n\n“Substitutes can be defined as those products or services that meet a particular\n\nconsumer need but are available in other market. A substitute product is a product\n\nfrom another industry that offers benefits to the consumer similar to those of the\n\nproduct produced by the firms within the industry”.\n\n“The Threat of Substitutes means the availability of a product that the consumer can\n\npurchase instead of the industry’s product”.\n\nIn this case of Disney Parks and Resorts we think the Threat of Substitutes is\n\nrelatively high for the following reasons:\n\n● Cheaper alternatives to active entertainment, such as: Zoo, Museum, Movie,\n\nConcert, Sports.\n\nTheme parks are meant for active entertainment. Consumers could choose to go\n\nto the movies, park, sporting event or concert, just to name a few, instead of\n\ngoing to a theme park.\n\n● Disney maintains relevance because of unique experience.\n\nBecause Disney theme parks have a distinctive competency of their animated\n\ncharacters and their family fun rides, consumers cannot get the Disney\n\nexperience anywhere else – making Disney relevant.\n\n4.3 Potential Entrants\n\nIn Western countries the threat of potential entrants is low. The market of\n\namusement park is mature with more than 400 amusement parks and attractions in the\n\nU.S. and about 300 in Europe.\n\nBuilding a new park requires a significant capital. As example $5.5 billion have\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n22 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nbeen invested in Shanghai Disney. In my opinion this the main limitation for potential\n\nentrants as finding such a capital is really challenging. Adding that in the last years\n\nsome amusement parks have shown to be unprofitable. So potential investors may\n\nconsider putting their money into other businesses.\n\nIn China there are many opportunities in the amusement park market however\n\nthe competition is already intense with many new theme park projects. So it is\n\ndifficult for a newcomer to succeed.\n\nDisney parks have by far the strongest brand and loyal customers. Another\n\nstrength that limits the threat of new entrants.\n\n4.4 Bargaining Power of Supplier\n\n“Suppliers are those who supply the organization with what it needs to produce the\n\nproduct or service. As well as fuel, raw materials and equipment, this can include\n\nlabor and sources of finance. Suppliers can exert bargaining power on participants in\n\nan industry by raising prices or reducing the quality of purchased goods and services.\n\nPowerful suppliers can thereby squeeze profitability out of an industry unable to\n\nrecover cost increases in its own prices” (Michael, 1980).\n\nIn the case of Disney Park and Resorts we think the Bargaining Power of\n\nSupplier is Medium for the following reasons:\n\n● Limited suppliers\n\nNot many companies are in the industry of producing, building and maintaining\n\namusement rides. The few major of them are Bollinger & Mabillard, Intamin,\n\nVekoma, Arrow, Premier Rides, The Gravity Group, and S & S Power. Their\n\nproducts could be found in most of the theme parks throughout the world. Thus,\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n23 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nthose companies have large flexibility to bargain with Disney.\n\n● Switching costs\n\nThe unique products and service is not only unique but also popular among\n\nDisney’s customers. For the industry of producing toys or character related\n\nproducts, they had lower bargaining power. Disney has the pattern right on it,\n\nso it can ask any company to produce merchandise. However, in amusement\n\nrides industry, Disney can only buy specific rides from limited company. If\n\nDisney wants to change the supplier, the switching cost would be high.\n\n● Supplier sustainability\n\nThe company size may be an advantage to Disney. Suppliers do not control the\n\nbargaining power strongly because Disney they would want to keep their\n\nbusiness. Suppliers know that Disney is a stable company that could provide\n\nbusiness for many years to come.\n\n4.5 Bargaining Power of Buyers\n\nIn the parking and entertainment industry, there are four big bosses that are\n\nDisney, Six Flags, Seawood and Universal. While Disney is the leader in this\n\nOligopoly service industry, buyers’ bargaining power is much lower.\n\nThe buyers group is non concentrated: Disney park and resort has three competitors\n\nin their amusement park operate. For the 7 billions population in the world, they have\n\nno many choices for this kind of entertainment and the fact that, Disney Park and\n\nresort still stand steadily at first rate.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n24 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nThe buyer group demand is higher suppliers\n\nFigure 5. Disneyland in Anaheim\n\nDuring special events, it's common to see thousands of people on Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nat Disneyland in Anaheim. Here, they celebrate the park's 60th anniversary with a\n\n24-hour party that began at 6 a.m.\n\nThere are fun facts about Disneyland:\n\n● 0-25 minutes: 0-25 minutes is the average waiting time in line in low attendance\n\nday in Disneyland. But this is rarely happened, and you might have to wait for an\n\nhour + often.\n\n● Forecast rain: It might be larger attendance days before rain forecasted days.\n\n● Busy days: Week days are the least busy days. Saturdays are busier than Sundays.\n\nLong Weekends can be 3 times busier.\n\n● Discount ticket: Disney rarely offers discounts on single ticket. Because Walt\n\nDisney focuses on middle class, its prices are reasonable. The price changes are\n\nbased on season which is high when the market is good and reduced during low\n\nseason. For Knott's and Six Flags, their tickets are lower than Walt Disney (in\n\nrange of $40-50 ). However, Six Flag has discounts frequently (bringing Coke\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n25 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\ncans to get 50% off), and Knott's ticket price promotion can be found at\n\nsupermarkets. Unlike some of its competitors, Disney not often give discounts on\n\nsingle ticket purchases. They said that when the lower price, the quality is also\n\naffected.\n\n● Raising pass price and parking price: Some people speculated that Walt Disney\n\nticket price raising is needed way to reduce that large crowds during weekends\n\nand hot season the recent ticket increases are a much-needed way to reduce the\n\nlarge crowds that occurs at Disneyland during some weekends and high-demand\n\nseasons.\n\nParking prices at the Disneyland Resort also raised. New prices for annual\n\npassholders increases from $169 to $199. Theme park parking raised $1, to $18.\n\nDowntown Disney now only offer two hours of free parking, the hourly parking price\n\nnow is doubled from $6.\n\nFigure 6. Queue time for major attractions and visitors\n\nThis graph is for US Disney Resorts, which include Disneyland, Disney\n\nCalifornia Adventure & Walt Disney World, Florida (WDW includes: Magic Kingdom,\n\nEPCOT, Disney Hollywood Studios & Animal Kingdom) and is very generalised. The\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n26 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nTokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Hong Kong theme park\n\nattendance patterns will differ due to holidays that don't match with the USA.\n\nThe products is differentiated: Disney park and resort has their own\n\nspaciality and so are competitors. The feeling and experience is not the same for every\n\nkind of theme park so may be visitor will consider before making decision.\n\nMany switching costs on the part of the buyer: althought there is different\n\namong substitues but switching cost is not very high, because for the entertainment\n\nservice, different experience is necessary.\n\nSummary\n\nThe amusement park industry is a mature and profitable market in western\n\ncountries. Most of Disney’s established competitors are in North America. The\n\ncompany also faces competition in China where they recently opened a new park in\n\nShanghai. The threat of substitutes to amusement parks is relatively high however\n\nDisney has a strong brand and offers a unique experience making the visit of a park\n\nstill attractive. Disney parks are relatively free of potential entrants as opening a park\n\nrequires a huge capital. The bargaining power of suppliers is medium because there\n\nare only a handful of attraction makers and switching may cost a lot of money; once\n\nDisney makes a company build an attraction they have to stick with them several\n\nyears for the maintenance. The visitors have very low bargaining power as the entry\n\nticket prices are fixed and cannot be negotiated. Finally, Disney Park and Resorts has\n\nmany strengths, its future success will be determined by its ability to innovate and\n\nkeep offering a unique experience to its visitors.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n27 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nChapter 5 Strategic Group Analysis\n\nIn this strategic group analysis, first we discussed and found some popular theme\n\nor sensation parks and resorts in the world, which is Disney, Six Flag, Lego land,\n\nUniversal, Puy du fou, Europa Park, Tivoli, Wanda city and HK Marine Park. And we\n\nchose the two variable is Numbers of Location and Sensation or/and Theme Park.\n\nTable 2. Numbers of Location and Sensation or/and Theme Park\n\nNumbers of location Sensation/Both/Theme\n\nDisney 6 Both\n\nSix Flag 13 Sensation\n\nLego land 8 Both-theme\n\nUniversal 4 Both\n\nPuy du fou 1 Theme\n\nEuropa Park 1 Sensation\n\nTivoli 1 Both-Theme\n\nWanda city 2 Sensation\n\nHK Marine Park 1 Theme\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n28 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nFigure 7. Strategic Group cluster\n\n5.1 Single Location Theme-based Parks\n\n5.1.1 Internal competition of cluster: Medium\n\nThere is a competition in this category of parks as they need to differentiate from\n\nothers by storytelling, immersive experience and quality of shows. Innovation is also a\n\ncritical factor in this cluster. To attract returning visitor and build customer loyalty, the\n\nparks have to offer new shows and experiences. For example, when people get into\n\nYehLiu Ocean World, s/he can not only see fish exhibition but also see ocean theater\n\nperformance by sea lion and dolphin. During the performance, those performers can\n\neven interact with audiences. Thus, it become a special experience for customers.\n\n5.1.2 Mobility barriers: Medium\n\nThese parks can attract a larger audience by adding some rides, however their\n\ncurrent customers are not visiting because of rides but to live the themed experience.\n\nThese parks can expand internationally if they manage to build a strong enough brand.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n29 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n5.2 Single Location Mainly Theme with Few Rides Parks\n\nCluster\n\n5.2.1 Cluster internal competition: High\n\nIn the cluster of “Multiple location sensation-based”, there are two Parks\n\nincluding Tivoli Garden and Europa Park. Tivoli Garden was opened in 1843 in\n\nDenmark. Operation for 173 years, it is the second oldest amusement park in the\n\nworld. Tivoli is famous for its pleasure garden and some amusement rides such as one\n\nof world's oldest wooden roller coasters built in 1914 that is still operating today.\n\nWhile Europa Park was opened in 1975 in Germany. This park is themed as thirteen\n\nEuropean countries combine with Grimms' Fairy Tales. With plenty of stories and\n\nhigh capacity rides, people like to go there spending their vacation.\n\nBoth of two parks are located in Europe and have highly reputation. In 2015, the\n\nvisitor number of Tivoli Garden and Europa Park are 4.733 million and 5.5 million.\n\nAs a result, they are quite competing in Europe due to their similar characteristics.\n\nHowever, the Leofoo Village Theme Park (六福村主題遊樂園) was opened in\n\nTaiwan in 1979 as a Wildlife Park. Now Leofoo Village divide the theme into four\n\nareas, Arabian Kingdom, African Safari, South Pacific, and Wild West. They combine\n\nwildlife park and amusement rides together. That’s why they could attract 1.65 million\n\npeople in 2015, which is the highest among Taiwan amusement parks. The target\n\nvisitors include family, couples, students and those who want to experience various\n\nattractions in one day. So the visitor flow is different from above two amusement\n\nparks due to the location and type.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n30 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n5.2.2 Cluster Mobility: Low-medium\n\nThe mobility of single location theme park is low-medium. Tivoli Garden and\n\nEuropa Park are in specific theme such as its history or national and story\n\ncharacteristics that attract visitors around the world. There are two ways to think about\n\nit. One is that if they move to the other cluster, their attractiveness might be cut down.\n\nThen stay in their original cluster would be better for them. However, in such a\n\ncompetitive environment, they have to try harder and harder to keep their customers.\n\nThus, they could improve their rides and equipment to enhance attention. And\n\ngradually move toward both theme and sensation park.\n\n5.3 Multiple Location, Mainly Theme with Few Rides Park\n\n5.3.1 International competition of cluster: Low\n\nCompetition in this kind of park is relatively low because they have special\n\ntheme that is Lego and they differentiate from others. Therefore, they can hold a\n\ncertain customer of their own.\n\nRemaining high visitor attendance and building customer loyalty are the biggest\n\nmission of this cluster. While existing competitor continuously expand and innovate\n\ntheir appearance all over the word as well as more and more rivalry of new\n\namusement parks, Legoland need to renew audience experience by adding more\n\nshows, games,…\n\n5.3.2 Mobility barriers: Medium\n\nThe mobility barriers of this kind of park is medium, Legoland has diversified\n\nactivities such as waterpark, Lego bricks, shows, rides and so on. So that they can\n\nserve and satisfy various groups of customer. Visitors also find specific experience in\n\nthese kinds of recreation in Lego theme. These parks can strengthen their\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n31 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nglobalization if they expand their appearance in more nations buy building more\n\namusement parks next stage.\n\n5.4 Multiple Location Sensation-Based Cluster\n\n5.4.1 Cluster internal competition\n\nIn this cluster, which we named “Multiple location sensation-based”, there are\n\ntwo firms: Six Flags and Wanda City. Six Flags operates all over USA, with a total of\n\neleven different locations and numerous parks; outside of USA it also have parks in\n\nChina and Dubai. Six Flags is heavily sensation-based, almost no themes or\n\nbackground stories are incorporated into its rides. Wanda City is an emerging theme\n\npark business in China, it operates in two locations, one is Nanchang (南昌) and the\n\nother one is Hefei (合肥). In the parks, they are equipped with thirty-three set of\n\nworld-class rides. The most eye-catching ride is the 白龍飛天 roller-coaster. It\n\nstretches over one kilometer, with a height of fifty-six meters, and the speed can reach\n\n125 kilometers per hour. It is the highest and fastest roller-coaster in the world. Wanda\n\nCity is quite the new comer comparing to Six Flags, but it has great ambitions and is\n\nexpanding and investing aggressively.\n\nEven though Six Flags and Wanda City are in the same cluster, they had little\n\ncompetition with each other due to their difference in location, Six Flags mainly\n\noperates in the US and in China, Wanda City. They would become direct competitors\n\nonce they expand to more international sites, but as for now, they are more likely to be\n\ncompeting with other amusement parks from other clusters which operate in the same\n\nregions.\n\n5.4.2 Cluster Mobility\n\nFor cluster mobility, it would be fair to say that this cluster’s entry barrier is\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n32 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nrelatively low. One would need to invest a great deal of capital to acquire land and\n\nfacilities (eg. rides, restaurants, infrastructures, etc.), and that would be about it. Less\n\ncreativity and innovation would be needed then coming up with an attractive and\n\nsuccessful theme for theme-based parks.\n\nHowever, for Six Flags and Wanda City to move towards being more\n\ntheme-based, it would be more challenging. First of all, these parks are already\n\nwell-known for providing highly sensational entertainment, to add new themes and\n\nstories to its rides might not be beneficial, as this would undifferentiated them from\n\ntheir competitors such as Universal and Disney. Sometimes visitors just want to\n\nexperience the excitement without having to process the story behind it. Secondly,\n\nwhen merging a story-based theme to a ride, the appearance of the ride would need to\n\nbe specifically designed for its purpose of telling the story. These parks already has\n\ntheir rides in place, either replacing them or altering them would be a huge\n\ninvestment.\n\nOverall, we believe that entering this cluster would be relatively easy if one\n\ninvests time and capital into it. On the other hand, exiting this cluster would be more\n\nchallenging and risky, due to reasons mentioned above.\n\n5.5 Global Theme and Sensation Parks Cluster\n\n5.5.1 Cluster internal competition\n\nIn this cluster, which we named “Global theme and sensation Parks Cluster”, one\n\nis Disney, Disney has six locations in the world, which is California (1955), Florida\n\n(1971), Tokyo (1983), Paris (1992), Hong Kong (2005) and Shanghai (2016).\n\nDisneyland is distributed all over the world. Inside the Disney parks, there have\n\nsensation and theme parks. Another is Universal, Universal has four locations in the\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n33 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nworld, which is California, Florida, Tokyo, and Singapore. Universal is distributed all\n\nover the world. Inside the Universal, there have sensation and theme parks. I think\n\nDisney and Universal are competitors in these cluster, and they will be complement\n\neach other forever. They have different rides and theme in their parks, so they will\n\nattract different visitors to enter the park.\n\n5.5.2 Cluster Mobility\n\nI think the mobility of the Global theme and sensation Parks Cluster is low,\n\nbecause Disney and Universal are distributed all over the world, and they have\n\ndifferent sensation and theme parts, they will attract different visitors to enter the park\n\nand play in the park. I think Disney and Universal do not need to remove single theme\n\npark or single sensation park, because they use their attraction, creation and\n\ninnovation to let their visitors make them happy and enjoy their selves. If Disney or\n\nUniversal remove to single theme or sensation parks, they will lose their number of\n\nvisitors who prefer to the theme or sensation parks is their reason to enter the park. It\n\nis not a wise choice at all.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n34 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nChapter 6 Resource and Capability Analysis\n\nIntroduction\n\n“It is important to distinguish between the resources and the capabilities of the\n\nfirm: resources are the productive assets owned by the firm; capabilities are what the\n\nfirm can do.” (Robert M.Grant,2007.)\n\nIn the entertainment industry, Disney must compete in a complex and\n\nchallenging environment to maintain its position as the master of globalization. Hence,\n\nthe importance of understanding the firm’s capabilities and resources, finding out the\n\nfirm’s competitive advantages, is unneglectable. On one hand, it is beneficial to\n\nunderstand and enhance those capabilities, and reinforce on weaknesses - it helps to\n\nincrease customers’ satisfaction and strengthens customer relationship. On the other\n\nhand, competitive advantages help Disney to be sustainable over time, generate\n\nrevenues and profits year by year.\n\nTherefore, in this report, we’ve carried out an analysis of capabilities and\n\nresource of Disney Parks and Resorts to find out how Disney has reached its success.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n35 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n6.1 Resources\n\nBelow are some tangible and intangible resources of Disney, including financial\n\nand physical resources, technology, reputation, patents, entertainment and culture, and\n\nhuman resources.\n\nTable 3. Resources\n\nResource Details Indicators\n\nTangible\n\nResources\n\nFinancial Income Ticket sales, restaurants\n\nincome, hotel revenue\n\nPhysical\n\nParks Asset\n\nRides Many attractive rides\n\nLand\n\nIntangible\n\nResources\n\nTechnology\n\nTechnological know-how\n\nAnimation technology\n\nReputation\n\nBrand equity\n\nBrand names 13 rank\n\nCustomer’s attendance large number visitor\n\nevery year\n\nPatents Media Technology\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n36 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nEntertainment Characters and plots (from\n\nFilms and TV series)\n\nCulture Organizational Culture\n\nHuman Resources Loyalty of employees Good salary rate,\n\nrestrictions, welfare\n\n6.1.1 Tangible resource\n\nFinancial\n\n Income:\n\nDisney park and resort has sustainable and large income every year from park\n\nTickets, restaurants, hotel and resort service. The revenue of Disney Park and Resort\n\nincreased yearly (14.087M $ in 2013 and 15.099M S in2014), while the profit is also\n\nhigh (2.220M$ in 2013 and 2.663M$ in 2014). (By Walt Disney). As we know,\n\ncapital is one of the most important factor which contribute to the success of a firm,\n\nand Disney has strong advantage in this factor.\n\nPhysical\n\n Parks:\n\nDisney has six park and resorts in different location including California, Florida,\n\nTokyo, Paris, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, which can attract visitors around the world.\n\nPeople from America to Asia, and even Europe can enjoy Disney atmosphere.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n37 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n Rides:\n\nThe rides in Disney fit almost every age level person. There are many rides in\n\nDisney park with Disney characters or icons. The top three Disney classic rides are\n\nDumbo, Peter Pan’s Flight, and Its’s a small world.\n\n Land:\n\nThe land area of Disney is an advantage especially when comparing to other\n\namusement park. The largest one is in Florida, the USA, which has 12228 hectares\n\nwith four theme parks, two water parks, some other attractions, and thirty-four resorts\n\nand hotels. The second largest is in Paris, which has 1951 hectare with five themed\n\nland. The third is large location is located in Shanghai with 700-hectare land with\n\nseven themed lands. California and Tokyo has similar area of land, one is 206 hectares\n\nand the other is 201 hectares. The smallest Disney is in Hong Kong with 126 hectares\n\nof land, but still larger than many other parks.\n\n6.1.2 Intangible resource\n\nTechnology\n\n Animation technology:\n\nDisney is famous for its work of art in the field of animation, numerous films and\n\nTV series are the results of Disney’s hardworking animation artists. They constantly\n\ndevelop new technology to bring their creation to the next level; for example,\n\nanimated hair/fur on human/animal characters has become more and more realistic\n\novertime, from Monster Inc. to this year’s Zootopia.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n38 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n Technological know-how:\n\nBeing technologically advanced is crucial for Disney Parks and Resorts, as it\n\nhelps operation around the parks, providing better guest experiences. For example, the\n\nintroduction of the Magic Band. Magic bands are small, wearable bracelets that has an\n\nRFID chip connected directly to your credit card, hotel room, and park tickets. A\n\nsuper easy way to get around the parks and resorts without any hassle. Fast Pass+ is\n\nalso a great example, Disney use crowd projections to allocate a certain number of\n\nspots per ride per time frame, so that the guests can pre-select when they want to ride.\n\nAnd then, having those reservations made and tied directly to your MagicBand makes\n\nit that much easier.\n\nReputation\n\n Brand Equity:\n\nThe Walt Disney was ranked 2nd in the world’s Most Reputation Companies,\n\n2016, because of the citizenship and governance categories.

They have long queue of visitors, you\n\neven have to wait hours even in weekdays, this number of visitor in hot season is\n\nmuch higher and raising ticket price is considered to be needed measure to control the\n\ncrowd.\n\nPatent\n\nMedia Technology: Disney thrives to bring the best experience to its millions of\n\nguests every year, new technology is being developed and put into use continuously.\n\nThe brilliant engineers and artists of Disney put their minds together to introduce the\n\nworld to the newest entertainment experience and services. Patents of Disney covers a\n\nwide range from control systems to artificial intelligence, from image projection to\n\nuser application, and much more.\n\nEntertainment\n\nCharacters and plots (from Films and TV series): One of Disney Parks and\n\nResorts’ biggest strategy is telling stories, and people goes to Disney’s theme park for\n\nthe “theme”, the fairy tales they enjoyed as a kid (eg. Cinderella), the TV series (eg.\n\nTinkerbell) and films they watched and love (eg. Toy Story), and etc. These beloved\n\ncharacters and stories are Disney’s biggest attraction, what all other parts of Disney is\n\nbuilt upon. This is what makes Disney special and different from other theme parks,\n\nand cannot be easily imitated.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n42 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nCulture\n\nDisney’s core value is to bring happiness to everyone. To reach this goal, they\n\nalways immerse corporate value and organizational culture into new employee\n\norientation training. If someone who cannot fit into the culture, then s/he would not be\n\nhired. And now they even treat this training process as a product. They sell to others\n\nwho are willing to learn and like Disney culture and value.\n\n6.1.3 Human Resources\n\n Loyalty of employees:\n\nDisney gets the loyalty of employees by good salary rate, welfare and company’s\n\nculture and environment. In Disney US, Average Walt Disney Parks and Resorts\n\nhourly pay ranges from approximately $7.25 per hour for Planner to $20.31 per hour\n\nfor Host/Hostess. The average Walt Disney Parks and Resorts salary ranges from\n\napproximately $14,500 per year for Greeter to $85,045 per year for Project Manager.\n\nHow much does Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in United States pay?\n\nAverage Walt Disney Parks and Resorts hourly pay ranges from approximately\n\n$7.25 per hour for Planner to $20.31 per hour for Host/Hostess. The average Walt\n\nDisney Parks and Resorts salary ranges from approximately $14,500 per year for\n\nGreeter to $85,045 per year for Project Manager.\n\nEmployees level:\n\nDisney has talented labor force that are experts in their fields. This can be seen\n\nby their job experience and certification in many areas.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n43 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n6.2 Capabilities\n\nBelow are the capabilities of Disney, including acquisition, management, innovation,\n\nand services.\n\nTable 6. Capabilities\n\nCapabilities\n\nAcquisition Purchasing successful companies (Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucas\n\nfilm), bringing in new contents\n\nManagement In addition to conventional function-based departments, also\n\nincludes more specialized departments.\n\nInnovation They apply new tech into their rides and all surrounding\n\nServices The entire park has free wifi for all guests.\n\nAcquisition\n\nDisney has been generating classic fairy tales for decades, but now creating a\n\npopular and profitable story is harder than ever. Therefore, why not just directly\n\nharvest stories that has already generated its large fan base? Disney’s acquisition of\n\nMarvel Studios and Lukas film (Star Wars) not only requires capital, but also a great\n\nvision and boldness to execute. This can be considered as one of Disney’s strongest\n\ncapabilities: knowing when to take a leap of faith.\n\nManagement\n\nInstead of the conventional hierarchical management style, Disney Parks and\n\nResorts had its organization structure designed around specific functions and project.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n44 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nEach department has its main objective, if needed, collaboration between departments\n\ncould be direct and straight forward.\n\nTable 7.

To attract customers in the competitive\n\namusement industry, Disney always has new program or surprising performances. For\n\nexample, they held Halloween party parade this year to fit in the atmosphere. And\n\nanother example is that they use new technology to collect data in the park to know\n\ncustomers’ preferences products or rides.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n45 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nServices\n\nAt Disney World, the entire park has free wifi for all guests. Consider how big\n\nthe resort is, and the capacity that the system must support, and where they hide all the\n\ncamouflaged wifi routers. The free wifi for all guests is actually a pretty innovative\n\nand awesome technological feat.\n\n6.3 Resources and Capabilities Analysis\n\nA company’s resources and capabilities analysis is critical and can clearly show\n\nits strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTable 8.

In detail, the strong brand which specialize the\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n46 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nquality of them make customers distinguish and think of Disney as the master of\n\ntheme park.\n\nDisney also has strong team that are expert in their field and make sure to bring\n\ncustomers best quality and service. Such a good team makes the company really\n\nstrong in operations, managing its different pars efficiently. Finally, all these strengths\n\nwork toward the main strength of Disney that offering a global immersive experience.\n\nSuperfluous strengths:\n\nRides, the rides in Disney theme park can bring customers good experience, but\n\nit is not unsubstituted. Customers can use the rides of others with almost same\n\nsatisfaction.\n\nInconsequential Weaknesses:\n\nlimited number of location is really a weakness but it doesn’t much affect to\n\nDisney theme park. Customers from all over the world is willing to go for long\n\ndistance, even oversea to use Disney service and entertainment.\n\nKey weakness:\n\nWaiting time for some attractions. The service of Disney theme park is\n\nsometimes overload and guests have to wait hours to buy some ticket attractions.\n\nEspecially in hot season, they might be hustled and jostled. In the end, some of them\n\nrefuse to go to Disney in that period. It is the most weakness of Disney that might\n\ncause customer satisfaction and decrease their loyalty.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n47 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n6.4 VRIS Analysis\n\n6.4.1 Capability\n\nBelow are the capabilities, acquisition, management, innovation, and international\n\ncapabilities of Disney.\n\nTable 9.

Value Chain\n\n7.1 Firm Infrastructure\n\nFinancial\n\nRevenue\n\nThe total consolidated revenues of Disney company are 52,465 million.\n\nAccording to Disney fiscal 2015 report, Parks and Resorts earn 16,162 million at the\n\nsame year, which is one third of total revenue. And they increase 7% from 2014 to\n\n2015.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n50 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nTable 11. The Total Consolidated Revenues of Disney Company\n\n(in millions)\n\nSegment operating income (loss)\n\nThe total Disney segment operating income is 14,681 million in 2015. Park and\n\nResorts accounting for 3,031 million, it is almost one-fifth of total. Compare to fiscal\n\n2014, 2,663 million, they have about 14% growth.\n\nTable 12. Segment Operation Income\n\n(in millions)\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nFor domestic market, Disney invest from 1,184 million (2014) to 1,457 million\n\n(2015) for expand new attractions, systems infrastructure, cruise ships, capital\n\nimprovements. For International market, Disney invest from 1,504 million (2014) to\n\n2,147 million (2015) largely because the construction of Shanghai Disney Resort.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n51 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nTable 13. Investing Activities\n\n(in millions)\n\nOrganization\n\nDisney has six Park and Resorts around the world which are managed in three\n\nways: sole property, partial ownership, and licensing. Disney owns and operates in\n\ntwo location in USA. One is Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, and the other is\n\nDisneyland Resort in California. For its international parts, Disney has 81% interest in\n\nDisneyland Resort Paris (recapitalization), 47% in Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.\n\nDisney practiced joint venture with French Government and the Government of the\n\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region, but Disney can wholly manage those two\n\nparks. The situation is somehow different in Shanghai Disney Resort, where Disney\n\ncompany has 43% ownership interest, the other 57% is owned by Shanghai Shendi(上\n\n海申迪集團). Disney company has 70% interest of management right, the other 30%\n\nright belongs to Shendi group. Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan is the exception, where\n\nDisney licenses intellectual property to them instead.\n\nLegal Affairs\n\nDisney Park and Resorts is a huge organization. To manage this international\n\nbusiness well, Disney had formed a group to deal with business affairs, contracts,\n\nprivacy, country law, patents, copyrights, etc. This group plays an important role\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n52 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nbecause it protects and solves any problem related to Disney comprehensively from\n\npark construction to operation. For example, they investigate in people who infringed\n\ntrademark rights and copyrights, as well as the stores that use “Disney Store” name\n\nwithout authorized. Another example is that this group negotiate with joint venture\n\npartners when Disney entering into international market such as land lease, cost, and\n\ncapital to meet the win-win situation.\n\n7.2 Human Resources Management\n\nRecruiting\n\nDisney has a standard operation procedure when recruiting new employees.\n\nBesides basic qualifications, Disney prefer to recruit those who believe in and are\n\nwilling to follow Disney’s values. There are seven values including “Honesty,\n\nOpenness, Balance, Diversity, Integrity, Respect, and Courage.” Also, Disney has\n\nreleased guidelines for their employees. They need to follow restrictions from clothing\n\n(color of undergarment, accessory prohibition, tattoos covered, etc.) to behaviors\n\n(chewing gum, smoking, having poor posture, etc., are prohibited). If the applicant\n\ncould not accept the requirements above, s/he may have no chance in getting into\n\nDisney.\n\nTraining\n\nDisney has its own learning school called “Disney University”. New employees\n\nhave to take the course “Disney Traditions” to learn about Disney-related facts. With\n\nthis course, new staff can understand Disney’s current status, development, features\n\nand segmentations. They also learn from basic Disney story to their role in this family.\n\nDisney would also asked full time employees to take classes each year to acquire\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n53 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nmore skills, trends and knowledge.\n\nWelfare\n\nTo maintain staff loyalty, Disney offers a set of rewards package. The benefits\n\ninclude medical insurance, accident insurance, annual leave, overtime payment,\n\nlaundry services for uniforms and costumes. Also, s/he will get free or discount ticket\n\nfor him/herself, family and friends to worldwide Disney theme parks and resorts. The\n\nhotels, shopping stores, dining area also have discount if staff ID is shown.\n\n7.3 Technology Development\n\nThere is no doubt that technology Development is significant for Disney.\n\nThrough creative and innovative techniques, Disney can provide customers\n\na-dream-come-true experiences and moments in the tale with the interaction manner.\n\nWhen it comes to theme parks, examples of utilization of technology can be found in\n\nmany places, such as the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyages, where the latest visual\n\neffects and sound immersion technologies are implemented. The latest technology is\n\nnot only used in innovation storytelling, but also in the reservation system of\n\nDisneyPark.com, where customers can customize their trip to Disney Resorts in the\n\nlight of their own preferences.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nDisney’s R&D division develops better ways of providing entertainment to their\n\nguests. Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development, Inc. is the research and\n\ndevelopment arm of The Walt Disney Company, it is responsible for the creation,\n\ndesign, and construction of Disney theme parks and attractions worldwide. They\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n54 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\ndesign and building Disney theme parks, resorts, and other entertainment venues at all\n\nlevels of project development.\n\nTechnology (Bringing Innovation)\n\nDisney Parks and Resorts is a typical example of the spirit of innovation. Much\n\nof that innovation is driven by technology to create new and exciting experiences.\n\nTheir imagineers love Disney stories and experience, and used technology to make\n\nthem more interactive, and even more entertaining. For example, they use 3D\n\ninnovation with 4D to enhance the attraction and allow guests to experience the story\n\nfrom a toy’s perspective. The guests can also experience Toy Story Midway Mania! at\n\nDisney California Adventure Park.\n\n7.4 Procurement\n\nDisney is a unique and important customer to many of its suppliers, therefore it\n\nhas the ability to purchase with the lowest price while obtaining the highest quality of\n\nits supplies. Procurement is a support function where the company can make the\n\ngreatest savings. This is due to the fact that capital expenditures for domestic and\n\ninternational Parks and Resorts take up almost 70% of the total capital expenditures of\n\nthe company. Because of diverse business lines with their own business strategies,\n\nDisney could not use standardization as their fundamental strategy for procurement\n\nand supply chain management throughout the conglomerate. That being said, its\n\ndiverse business lines also bring opportunities for cooperation and generating\n\nsynergies among them. Procurement for Disney Parks and Resorts include activities to\n\nmaintain the optimum operating level cost efficiently. Some Disney parks products\n\ncan be found in others Disney parks, and the design can be use in others countries.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n55 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n7.5 Inbound Logistics\n\nDisney Park and Resort’s strategy is based on providing “customer experience”,\n\nthus its inbound logistics would be quite unusual comparing to conventional\n\nmanufacturing industries.\n\nConstruction facilities, goods and warehouses\n\nDisney Parks and Resorts have sustainable suppliers for their inbound, from\n\nattraction construction to hotel, cruise and restaurant. Being a global brand, its goal is\n\nto bring the best experience to visitors. Therefore, they customize by offering safe\n\nrides, fresh foods, comfortable hotel, and etc.…from the very first inbound.\n\nTechnology\n\nAnimation technology and technology know-how are components that contribute\n\ngreatly to Disney Parks and Resorts. They are the key elements in bringing the\n\ncharacters from films of Disney to life in Disney theme parks. The continuously\n\ndeveloping technology in Disney Parks and Resorts also gives customers special\n\nexperiences and convenience. For example, the magic band - small bracelets that has\n\nchip connecting to park tickets, hotel rooms and credit cards.\n\nEmployees\n\nDisney Parks and Resorts have teams of workers that are experts in their field.\n\nTheir duties are bringing visitors happiness and quality service. The thoughtfulness\n\nwithin Disney’s employees towards their guests is one of their elements of success.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n56 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n7.6 Operations\n\nConstruction and maintenance\n\nThe main active of Disney park and resort are constructing rides and attractions\n\nwhich also including repairing and adding in new technology and appearance.\n\nCreating events and trips\n\nOne of the biggest difference of Disney park and resort is their themes of cartoon\n\ncharacters, stories,…from films or animation that they produced. They not only create\n\nparade, music concert in special events annum in the park and resort but also voyage\n\nin many periods all over the world.\n\nService (attractions, hotels, cruise, restaurant, and etc.)\n\nAs the master of service industry, good service is the most important things that\n\nDisney wants to bring to their customers. Service in park, hotel, cruise and restaurant\n\ncontribute a large percentage to the different operation of Disney park and resort.\n\n7.7 Outbound Logistics\n\nWe believe that Outbound logistics is not really applicable in the value chain of\n\nDisney parks and resort. Outbound logistics is usually part of the value chain of\n\nmanufacturing and trading companies. Disney parks and resorts belongs to a specific\n\nindustry with a specific value chain.\n\n7.8 Marketing & Sales\n\nOne of the strongest strength of Disney is integrating all of its business activities\n\nto create this synergy that brings in profit, the product of the movie industry could be\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n57 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nhave the effect of marketing for the theme park industry or Disney’s consumer\n\nmerchandises. In this analysis, we will be focusing on the marketing and sales\n\nactivities related to Disney Parks and Resorts.\n\nContent Marketing\n\nAs we have mentioned before, Disney is an empire selling stories, imaginations,\n\nand happiness. When you visit a Disney theme park, you see rides, restaurants, hotels\n\nthat are designed around a certain Disney movie or Disney character you have seen\n\nbefore. In a way, we can say that Disney movies play heavy roles in marketing of the\n\nparks. There are many examples, such as Tokyo Disney introducing their new\n\nattraction based on “Finding Nemo” and “Finding Dory” in 2017, and Hong Kong\n\nDisney’s new attraction “Iron Man Experience”.\n\nFigure 9. Finding Nemo /Dory attraction/ride concept art\n\nFigure 10. Finding Nemo\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n58 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nFigure 11. Iron Man Experience\n\nSocial Media\n\nToday social media is a part of people’s lives, and a pretty big one too. The\n\ninternet allows firms to reach its customers faster and cheaper. Disney’s official\n\nFacebook page alone has over 50 million likes, Disneyland and Walt Disney World\n\nhave around 33 million likes combined; and we are just getting started. Listed below\n\nare the statistics extracted from Disney’s different social media platforms.\n\nTable 14. Social Media Platform and User Statistics\n\nSocial Media Platform Statistics\n\nFacebook 50 million likes\n\nTwitter 5.13 million followers\n\nInstagram 7.6 million followers\n\nYoutube 1.9 million subscribers\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n59 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nApart from social medias, Disney also runs its own “Buzzfeed” website called\n\n“Oh My Disney\" and the “Disney Parks Blog”, which continuously provide contents\n\nabout Disney, including new attractions in theme parks, promotion of current releases,\n\nTV series, Movies, trivia, quizzes, and etc. This keeps the fans updated and interested\n\nbetween their visits to the parks and resorts.\n\nIn order to attract the more “mature” customers to Disney Parks and Resorts,\n\nDisney had launched some interesting campaigns. One of them is the “Disney Dream\n\nPortraits”, where Disney casted Hollywood A-list stars as iconic Disney characters in\n\na set of photo shoots. This marketing activity obviously targeted at customers aside\n\nfrom children, and appeals to adults (eg. parents) and older fans.\n\nFigure 12. Taylor Swift as Rapunzel\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n60 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nFairy Tale Weddings\n\nMany of Disney’s fairy tales are stories of princesses living happily ever after\n\nwith the princes they fell in love with, and what more can a girl ask for when it comes\n\nto the ultimate princess experience: getting married in a Disney castle?\n\nFigure 13. Disney wedding\n\nStarting from 2012, happy couples are able to book weddings at Disney Parks in\n\nFlorida, California, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. Packages often include ceremony at the\n\ncastle, reception at the hotel hall, princess-inspired wedding gowns and bridesmaid\n\ndresses, and so on.\n\n7.9 Service\n\nAs Disney parks and resorts offers entertainment it can be considered as a service\n\ncompany, Service is a good opportunity for the company to improve their guests stay.\n\nThe company offers many services to its customers. Here is the list of services\n\nprovided by Walt Disney World, no less than 56 extra services are listed to fulfil the\n\nneed of most of the visitors and deliver a personalized experience. The list includes\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n61 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\numbrella rentals, mosquito prevention, laundry service, child care services or car care\n\ncenter… Service is a key strength of the company and contribute to the main goal of\n\nthe company that is providing a unique immersive experience.\n\nWhere does the value come from?\n\nDisney Parks and Resorts are magical kingdoms where dreams come true,\n\nbringing happiness and joy to its loyal guests. Being a benchmark business entity in\n\nthe leisure industry, the value of Disney theme parks is difficult to be measured in\n\nnumbers and diagrams. The value comes from the synergy of all departments within\n\nthe organization, thriving to provide the best entertainment for each and every\n\ncustomer. It is in the technology department, where the animations are so life-like\n\nwhen projected in 3D; it is in the human resource management and service, where\n\nemployees are trained to alway smile to the guest, to be happy to assist the guest in the\n\nbest fashion possible; it is in marketing, spreading words and creating trends on the\n\ninternet, causing ticket sales to skyrocket every year. Overall, the value of Disney\n\nParks and Resorts comes from its forever-progressing innovation and quality customer\n\nservices.\n\nDifferentiation or low cost strategy?\n\nIn industries that are more conventional, such as manufacturing or farming, the\n\nlow-cost strategy is usually implemented. However, with an entertainment business\n\nsuch as Disney, all has to give way to the content; they would definitely try to reduce\n\nredundant expenses, but in the end in all come down to differentiation, what differs\n\nDisney Parks and Resorts from its competitors. Running a theme park, especially a\n\nsuccessful theme park, is not cheap, so it would take outstanding contents and\n\nattractions to bring in visitors, to make them feel their ticket price is worthwhile.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n62 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nDisney differentiate in its contents, the one and only Mickey Mouse and his friends,\n\nand other classic franchises that are found nowhere in the world. Disney also\n\ndifferentiate in its service, employees are well-trained in an unique “Disney style”, it\n\ncan be seen in their looks, behaviors, and attitude, unlike any other theme parks. In\n\nconclusion, Disney expertise in differentiation, resulting it to be one of the most\n\nsuccessful business in history and the years to come.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n63 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nChapter 8 BCG Matrix and Synergies\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis week we focused on the BCG growth-share matrix and the synergies that\n\nDisney has created within the conglomerate. Disney is such an entertainment empire\n\nthat it operates in many different industries: theme parks, studios, cable network,\n\nconsumer merchandises, and etc. We looked at several SBUs that are more\n\nwell-known to the general public, and discuss their positions on the BCG matrix, and\n\nwhat kind of synergies were produced.\n\nFigure 14.

In 2016, there was no growth in\n\nthat division and in particular a decrease in overall revenue as the company faces\n\nlower advertising and affiliation revenue and higher operational and production costs.\n\nThe TV industry is not going to have a bright future as new generations spend less and\n\nless time watching shows and more and more time on the Internet. In the BCG matrix\n\nwe can consider ESPN Inc. as a Dog.\n\n8.1.2 Lucasfilm - Star\n\nThe last major acquisition from Disney group in 2012, Lucasfilm, for $4.06\n\nbillion was a smart and profitable move. The phenomenally successful return of Star\n\nWars, and Studio’s record-breaking $7.5 billion in total box office made the Studio\n\nEntertainment division operating results grew by 28% for fiscal year 2016. We can say\n\nthat LucasFilm SBU is a Star in the BCG matrix that will bring growth and profits to\n\nthe group with future Star Wars movie currently being produced.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n65 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n8.1.3 Disney Channels Worldwide－Question Mark\n\nDisney Channels Worldwide (ABC Cable Networks Group) is under ABC\n\ntelevision Group, which provide television channels ans radio network. This\n\nsubsidiary has variety of channels such as Disney Junior (for children 8 years and\n\nunder), Disney Channel (kids ages 9–16), Disney XD (pre-teens and young teenagers),\n\nDisney Cinemagic (movie channel in European market), Dlife (women and family\n\ntargeted channel), and Hungama TV (for children in India).\n\nRevenue\n\nAs we can see on the report, the revenue in cable network (Disney Channels\n\nWorldwide) has growth 10% from 15,110 million (2014) to 16,581 million (2015).\n\nAnd the segment operating income also increase about 5%.\n\nTable 15. Revenue in Cable network\n\nViewer ranking\n\nThe network viewer ranking of Disney Channel is number nine in 2015. They\n\nhave 1,784,000 viewers. Although they had decrease about 9% watcher from 2014 to\n\n2015, they can still keep their ranking in the front.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n66 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nTable 16. Network Viewers\n\nMarket share\n\nWhen it comes to market share, Disney Channel Worldwide have almost 29% of\n\nmarket rate. The other 71% market share are occupied by their competitors, including\n\nCbs Corporation, Comcast Corp, Discovery Communications, Inc., Twenty-first\n\nCentury Fox, Inc., News Corp, NEWS CORPORATION, Viacom Inc., and others. It\n\nis easy to see how Disney Channel Worldwide take part in this pie.\n\nFigure 16. Cable Networks Segment Market Share\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n67 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nWe consider Disney Channel Worldwide belongs to Question Mark. Nowadays,\n\nthere are so many media consumers can choose from. Every step they do may\n\ninfluence their position in this competitive industry.\n\n8.1.4 Walt Disney Animation Studios - Star\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS) has a long-running history dating all\n\nthe way back to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 1937, with the classic fairytales\n\nsuch as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, WDAS has developed and evolved as time\n\nwent on. Oscar-winning films including Frozen and Big Hero 6 are also the amazing\n\nartworks produced by WDAS.\n\nFigure 17. Walt Disney Animation Studios\n\nAs a SBU of Disney, WDAS does not really have a stock price of its own. To\n\nattempt to declare its position on the BCG matrix, we looked at how well WDAS is\n\nprofiting comparing to its competitors over the last few years, mimicking the indicator\n\nof market share.\n\nAs the table suggested below, WDAS is one of the top four firms in the animated\n\nfilm industry (US). Over the last three years, WDAS has generated over 680 million\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n68 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nUSD in box office, occupying approximately 14.5% of the market. Pixar is the leading\n\nstudio in this industry, that being said, it is also a SBU of Disney, so overall, we could\n\nsay that Disney is ahead of the game. Judging from their results (see appendix table 1),\n\nZootopia was definitely an exciting success after the already-pretty-successful Big\n\nHero 6, and it looks like WDAS did not plan on stopping. Moana’s 119 million box\n\noffice was achieved in two weeks’ time, as different foreign release date coming up, it\n\nis possible for WDAS to reach a new high.\n\nTable 17. 2014-2016 Animated Films Total Lifetime Gross\n\nFirm\n\n2014-2016 Animated\n\nFilms Total Lifetime\n\nGross\n\nPercentage\n\nPixar 965.84 20.5%\n\nDreamWorks Animation 834.16 17.7%\n\nIllumination Entertainment 704.07 15.0%\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios 683.69 14.5%\n\nWarner Bros. 329.02 7.0%\n\nBlue Sky Studios 325.78 6.9%\n\nSony Pictures Animation 277.21 5.9%\n\nOthers 583.84 12.4%\n\nTotal 4703.61 99.9%\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n69 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nFigure 18. Big Hero 6, Zootopia, and Moana\n\nIn terms of market growth, many articles suggested that animated films is truly\n\nthe “box office magic”, animation is no longer targeted towards children, but has\n\nbecome much more “adult acceptance”. For example, kids can enjoy all the “animals\n\nliving like humans” theme in Zootopia; the adults, however, can see through all those\n\ncuteness, and take away the social issue “prejudice” behind Judy’s adventure.\n\nThe progress of animation technology also promises a bright future for animated\n\nfilms, not to mention the up-and-coming tide of future 3D and VR. However, it would\n\nbe the scipts, the backbone of a film to really lures the audience into theatres. It is\n\nvery exciting to see what WDAS has to bring to the table next, and they rarely fail our\n\nexpectation.\n\nFor reasons above, I would categorize Walt Disney Animation Studios as a star\n\non the BCG matrix.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n70 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\n8.1.5 Pixar Animation Studios - Star\n\nPixar Animation Studios, similar to WDAS above, is in the animated film\n\nindustry. Pixar made its debut in 1995 with the legendary Toy Story, which we could\n\nsay paved Pixar the golden path towards its success. Until this day, even after\n\nDisney’s acquisition in 2006, Pixar continues to offer the world amazing stories and\n\ndazzling images.\n\nFigure 19. Pixar\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n71 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nFrom the table below, we can declare that Pixar is very much like the “golden\n\ngoose” in the fairytale Jack and the Beanstalk, it literally makes “gold”; this studio is\n\nno stranger to success. We believe it is safe to say that Pixar Animation Studios is also\n\none of Disney’s stars.\n\nTable 18 Pixar Animation Studios\n\nFilm Production Budget\n\n(in million USD)\n\nWorld Wide Gross\n\n(in million USD) Profit Rate\n\nToy Story 3 200 1,067 ~534%\n\nFinding Dory 200 1,026.9 ~514%\n\nFinding Nemo 94 899.2 ~957%\n\nInside Out 175 857.6 ~490%\n\nMonsters University 200 744.2 ~372%\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n72 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nTable 19.

Disney Parks around the world\n\nDisney finanal report - the fiscal 2016\n\nAccording to the fiscal 2016, you can see that the total consolidated revenues of\n\nDisney are $55,632 million, and Disney Parks and Resorts are about $16,974 million,\n\nit’s about one third of total revenues.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n74 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nTable 20. Disney Financial Report – the Fiscal 2016\n\nThe revenues for Disney Parks and Resorts consist of the sale of admissions to\n\ntheme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise, charges for room nights at\n\nhotels, sales of cruise vacation packages and sales and rentals of vacation club\n\nproperties, and are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities,\n\nreal estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.\n\nThe significant operating expenses include operating labor, infrastructure costs,\n\ncosts of sales and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include information\n\nsystems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, insurance\n\nand transportation and other operating expenses include costs for such items as\n\nsupplies, commissions, and entertainment offerings.\n\nAs the following table, you can see the percent % Change between 2015 and\n\n2016 for Disney Parks and Resorts is about 5%, the change for Disney Parks and\n\nResorts is the second highest percent % change in the four divisions, the first high\n\npercent % change is Studio Entertainment, which is about 28%.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n75 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nOperating Income\n\nThe growth of the operating income was because of an increase at the domestic\n\noperations, partially offset by a decrease at our international operations.\n\nHigher operating income at the domestic operations was due to guest spending\n\ngrowth and lower costs, partially offset by lower volumes. The increases in guests\n\nspending were driven by higher average ticket prices at the theme parks and cruise\n\nline. Lower costs reflected decreases in labor and marketing costs from efficiency\n\ninitiatives. Costs also benefited from lower infrastructure costs due to timing and a\n\ndecrease in fuel costs.\n\nLower operating income at the international operations was due to higher\n\npre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort and lower attendance and higher\n\noperating costs at Disneyland Paris. These decreases were partially offset by cost\n\nefficiency initiatives as well as higher volumes and guest spending at Hong Kong\n\nDisneyland Resort.\n\nTable 21. Operation Income\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Case Study\n\n76 FCU e-Paper (2016-2017)\n\nRevenues\n\nThe revenues in the Disney Parks and Resorts increased 5% ($812 million). The\n\nincrease of the revenues in average guest spending was due to higher average ticket\n\nprices for admissions to our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line, increased\n\nfood, beverage and merchandise spending and higher average hotel room rates.\n\nRevenues from our international operations reflected increases of 6% from higher\n\nvolumes and 4% from other revenue were due to the opening of Shanghai Disney\n\nResort, partially offset by lower attendance at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong\n\nDisneyland Resort. The increase from other revenue was driven by Shanghai Disney\n\nResort, including revenues for periods prior to its grand opening.\n\nTable 22. Revenues\n\nTable 23.
