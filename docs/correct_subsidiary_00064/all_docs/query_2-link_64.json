Disney store at Target locations will be among the select places in the U.S. where guests can browse and purchase Disney store specialty merchandise from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.\n\nDisney store at Target will launch just when the new assortment of merchandise from Disney’s Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker hits shelves.

The “shop-in-shop” will feature an enhanced Disney assortment of more than 450 items, including more than 100 products that were previously only available at Disney retail locations.\n\nGuests will be able to browse and shop a variety of Disney Princess, Star Wars, Marvel, Disney Junior characters, classic Disney plush, apparel, home and holiday-specific products. They’ll also be able to access collectible merchandise, including the Disney Animators’ Collection with dolls, clothing and accessories. Items will range in price from $2 - $200, with many items under $20.\n\nDisney store at Target will offer a welcoming and engaging shopping experience for the entire family, with music, interactive displays, photo opportunities and a seating area where families can relax and watch Disney movie clips and Park events.\n\nGuests can check out the look and feel of the new Disney digital experience on the Target site today. Disney store at Target will launch online on Oct. 4 at Target.com/Disneystore and in the Target app. The new online experience serves as a hub for the Disney stories and characters guests love, all in one place. The collection of merchandise will include an expanded assortment of new items in October, coinciding with the in-store launch. A store locator is available to help guests plan a visit to Disney store at Target and user-generated content showcases guest love for Target and Disney products.\n\nGuests will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of shopping at Target when they purchase items from Disney store at Target, whether online or in stores.
