So BVS decided to air DIGIMON FRONTIER on UPN weekday afternoons, (post-One Too) since Disney and Paramount were still competitors in the the theme park industry at that time, (and UPN being folded into MTV Networks and being managed under CBS) Disney can’t really afford the entire FOX KIDS library (except for Power Rangers) since Disney folded the name into JETIX. When Disney acquired most of 21CF in 2019: Disney halted, delayed or probably delayed more TCF Film projects since Disney wanted to refocus more on TCF's legacy of IPs. After the tragic introduction of the STAR brand as a more wider general entertainment name in International markets in 2021, the world was still in out of control mode. Also, when Disney purchased FOX KIDS: the company was facing troubles with its ABC and Touchstone brands….\n\n2021 also saw the tragic closure of BlueSky Studios as Disney wanted to focus more on Disney Animation and PIXAR…which was more profitable. Also Disney wanted to reboot all of the 20TH IP for Disney+, Hulu, FX on Hulu and STAR internationally. 20TH also has a partnership with FOX Media for producing programs for the FOX network. Since the network production units now mainly involves in the production of the show, the final remaining network that doesn't have a network-branded production unit is NBC since all NBC-branded units were folded into Universal TV to form NBCU TV (now called Universal TELEVISION and most of their upcoming inventory is controlled by a unit called the Universal Studios Group)"
