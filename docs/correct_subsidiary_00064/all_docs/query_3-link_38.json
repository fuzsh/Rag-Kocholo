        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nI saw my first Disney movie in the early eighties, I must have been seven or ten. It was ‘Bambi’, and it ran on TV as a series with a new episode coming out every week. I laughed and I cried and it was wonderful.\n\n‘One Thousand Dalmatians’, ‘The Aristocats’, ‘Lady and the Tramp’ and ‘Jungle Book’ followed – incredibly beautiful character drawings, flawless character movement and great storylines – I was hooked forever.\n\nMy Disney love began in childhood and carried me into adulthood (also comic books, but that’s another story). I watched every animated movie Disney has ever produced. I believe Hades (‘Hercules’) is the best and most underrated villain in a Disney movie. Hades was voiced by the incredible Oscar-winning James Woods who, I recently found out, said voicing Hades was his favourite job as an actor. When I saw ‘Beauty and the Beast’, I was a teenager and instantly connected with Belle because I was just like her: reading all the time, practically every book in my parents’ home library, a bit socially awkward. I still know every note, and almost every word, to ‘Part of your world’, Ariel’s song from ‘Little Mermaid’, one of the most beautiful songs in Disney history in my opinion. ‘Little Mermaid’ is also a testament to Disney’s genius storytelling and amazing artists: Ariel, the main character doesn’t speak for most of the movie, how about that! When Pixar became part of Disney (what a genius business move!), animation changed forever. I’ll stop right here so this article doesn’t turn into a 10,000-word celebration of the wonderful world of Pixar movies (discover the Pixar storytelling framework).\n\nIf you have ever seen a Disney movie, if you or your kids are Disney fans, or just curious to know how Disney became a movie powerhouse and a powerful brand worldwide, this article is for you.\n\nTo write this article, I selected relevant information from Disney’s website, the official Disney fan club, and the company’s latest financial report.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDISNEY COMPANY INFO\n\nCompany valuation: 168 billion dollars; Disney is in the top 3 biggest movie producers worldwide;\n\nNumber of employees: 220,000 worldwide (166,000 in the U.S. and approximately 54,000 internationally);\n\nNumber of Disney branded stores: 40 in Japan, 20 in North America, 3 in Europe and 1 store in China;\n\nThe Company owns 8 television stations which collectively reach approximately 20% of US television households;\n\nTV Channels outside the US: 220 General Entertainment channels (under Fox, National Geographic and Star brands), 75 Family channels (under Disney brand), 55 Sports channels (under ESPN, Fox and Star brands);\n\nDisney content is broadcast in approximately 40 languages and 180 countries/territories;\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company is expected to release approximately 40 titles (films and TV series)\n\nThe Disney Studios film library includes content from approximately 100 years of production history, as well as acquired film libraries and totals approximately 5,100 live-action titles and 400 animation titles;\n\nDisney Parks & Experiences:\n\n6 Parks:\n\nWalt Disney World Resort (Florida, USA)\n\nDisneyland Resort (California, USA)\n\nDisneyland Paris (France)\n\nHong Kong Disneyland Resort (Taiwan)\n\nShanghai Disney Resort (China)\n\nTokyo Disneyland (Japan)\n\n5 Disney Experiences:\n\nDisney Cruise Line\n\nDisney Vacation Club\n\nNational Geographic Expeditions\n\nAdventures by Disney\n\nAulani, a Disney Resort & Spa (Hawaii)\n\nRevenues by business segment:\n\nDisney Media and Entertainment Distribution – 55 billion dollars\n\nDisney Parks, Experiences and Products – 28,7 billion dollars\n\n100 YEARS OF DISNEY TIMELINE & MILESTONES (1923 – 2023)\n\n1923: Together with his brother, Roy, Walt establishes the Disney Brothers Studio, today The Walt Disney Company; he was 22. They take on contracts for animated shorts and story cartoons.\n\n1928: Walt creates Mickey Mouse.

It is Walt Disney’s first innovation: an amusement park where parents and children could go and have a good time together; more popular now than it was in 1955.\n\n1964: ‘Mary Poppins’ is released and is later nominated for 13 Academy Awards.

Sensing the company’s vulnerability, corporate raiders attempt a hostile takeover which, fortunately, is stopped by Walt’s nephew, Roy E Disney. With his help, the Company gets a new management team with a successful record track in Hollywood. The new leadership unlocks new revenue streams, finds new ways to maximize the assets and launches Disney into the top spot of the entertainment industry.\n\n1988: For the first time, Disney led Hollywood studios in box-office earnings: ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit’, ‘Good Morning, Vietnam’, ‘Three Men and a Baby’, and later, ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids’, ‘Dick Tracy’, ‘Pretty Woman’, and ‘Sister Act’ each pass the $100 million milestone.\n\n1991: ‘Beauty and the Beast’ is the first-ever animated feature film to be nominated for best picture at the Oscars; it lost to ‘Silence of the Lambs’.\n\n1994: ‘The Lion King’ is launched and soon becomes one of the highest-grossing films of all time. The Company ventures onto Broadway with a very successful stage production of ‘Beauty and the Beast’.\n\n1995: ‘Toy Story’, which pioneered computer animation techniques, enters the Guinness Book of World Records for being the first feature-length computer-animated movie ever made. It becomes the highest-grossing animated film of all time.\n\n1996: Disney completes its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC. The $19 billion transaction, the second-largest in U.S. history, brought the country’s top television network to Disney.\n\n1999: ‘The Sixth Sense’, whose script was acquired by Disney, becomes the second biggest hit of the year after ‘Star Wars – The Phantom Menace’.\n\n2003: ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl’ and ‘Finding Nemo’, two of the all-time highest-earning movies help Disney become the first studio in history to surpass $3 billion at the global box office.\n\n2006: ‘High School Musical’ airs and breaks all Disney Channel records, with its soundtrack going platinum. ‘Hannah Montana’ debuts on Disney Channel.\n\n2009: ‘Up’ is released, and won two Oscars.\n\n2019: Disney+ streaming service debuts.\n\n2012-2023: In this decade, Disney launched over 30 box office hit Hollywood movies, TV series and animated films from Marvel, Disney Studios and LucasFilm that made movie history and became iconic films part of pop culture.\n\nDISNEY STATISTICS & FUN FACTS\n\n2022 revenue: 83 billion dollars;\n\nDisney Plus has 164 million paid subscribers;\n\n62 million visitors annually across all Disney parks (Pixie Dust and Passports);\n\nAs a film producer, Walt Disney Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 32 Oscars;\n\nAs of 2023, The Walt Disney Company has won a total of 143 Academy Awards (Oscars) including Walt Disney’s;\n\n‘The Little Mermaid,’ ‘Iron Man’ were added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.
