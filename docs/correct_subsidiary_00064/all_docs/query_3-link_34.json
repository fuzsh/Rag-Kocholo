        "text": "The Comprehensive Disney-DeSantis Timeline in Simple Format\n\nA long time ago in a country not so far, far away…\n\n2020: Trump Lays the Foundation for Legislation Against Corporate DEI Training\n\nSeptember: Trump Takes on “Woke” Corporations\n\nPresident Trump issues executive order (EO) 13950, “Combat Race and Sex Stereotyping,” to prohibit any government employees or federal contractors from holding diversity training on historical racism.\n\nDecember: Executive Order Subject to Preliminary Injunction\n\nThe Northern District Court of California issues a nationwide preliminary injunction, emphasizing that the EO restricted speech the First Amendment protects and noted the government’s “impermissible reach” in restricting content used to train contractors.\n\n2021: New Admiration Pushes for Comprehensive Approach to Equality\n\nJanuary: Biden Revokes EO on Diversity and Inclusion\n\nPresident Biden formally rescinds EO 13950 and signs EO 13985 stating the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.” On the same day, Biden signs a separate but related order on “Preventing and Combatting Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.”\n\n2022: Political Fight Heads to Florida and Makes Disney Center of a Nationwide Cultural Debate\n\nJanuary 11: Florida Lawmakers Fill the “Individual Freedom” and “Parental Rights in Education” Bills\n\nDisney’s social impact saga begins when lawmakers in Florida fill two controversial pieces of legislation:\n\nHouse Bill 7, the Individual Freedom Bill, restricts race-based education in businesses, schools, and universities. Specifically, it bans any corporation or school from teaching that “an individual’s moral character or status, as either privileged or oppressed, is necessarily determined by his or her race, color, sex, or national origin.” This proposed legislation triggered a nationwide debate on diversity training, corporate free speech, and critical race theory. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis labels it the “Stop Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees Act,” or Stop WOKE Act.\n\nHouse Bill 1557, the Parental Rights in Education Bill, prohibits any classroom instruction involving sexual orientation or gender identity through the third grade and any discussions about it in older grades if it’s “in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” The bill also allows parents to sue schools or teachers that engage in these topics. Critics colloquially called it the “Don’t Say Gay” bill and marked it as discriminatory against the LGBTQ+ community. The bill’s author, Republican State Senator Dennis Baxley, actively backed anti-gay legislation for years, including laws that would block gay couples from adopting children.
