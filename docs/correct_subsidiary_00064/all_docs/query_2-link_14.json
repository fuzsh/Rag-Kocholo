        "text": "Logo descriptions and captures by AsdfTheRevival, Eric S., Sega3dmm, Shadeed A. Kelly, and V of Doom\n\nEditions by Shadeed A. Kelly, Mr. Logo Lord, V of Doom, edunk5, and Edc4\n\nBackground: Fox Kids (originally known as Fox Children's Network) was a children's programming block. Originally a joint venture between the Fox Broadcasting Company in partnership with it's affiliated stations, it was later owned by Fox Kids Worldwide Inc. from 1996 to 2001 and then by Fox Television Entertainment beginning in 2001. Fox Kids originated as a programming block that aired on the Fox network from September 8, 1990 to September 7, 2002. The block aired on Saturday mornings throughout its existence; an additional block on Monday through Friday afternoons aired until January 2002. Following then Fox parent News Corporation's sale of Fox Kids Worldwide to The Walt Disney Company in July 2001, Fox put the remaining Saturday morning timeslot up for bidding, with 4Kids Entertainment winning and securing the rights to program that period. The Fox Kids block continued to air in repeats until September 7, 2002, and was replaced the following week (on September 14) by the 4Kids-programmed FoxBox (later renamed 4Kids TV).\n\n1st Logo\n\n(September 8, 1990-May 8, 1993)\n\nLogo: On a purple and black gradient background, we see the name \"FOX CHILDREN'S PRODUCTIONS\" in gold in its 20th Century Fox font. With \"FOX\" in the big font on top, \"CHILDREN'S\" in the middle in a smaller size, and \"PRODUCTIONS\" at the bottom in the same font size. We later see a shining wipe effect slowly.\n\nFX/SFX: Just the name shining.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\nNone or the closing theme of the show.\n\nOn at least one episode of Bobby's World, the logo used the 20th Television music, most likely due to a production error.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. Appeared on Eek! Stravaganza's 1st and half of its second season (except for The Terrible Thunderlizards segments), Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!, Bobby's World, and Fox's Peter Pan & the Pirates among others. The first two haven't aired on TV in nearly two decades, and the last one has long since faded into obscurity. The third and seventh episodes of Eek! Stravaganza have been released on VHS however, so this logo should be left intact. Can also be found on Bobby's World on Netflix and select DVD-Rs.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(September 18, 1993-March 3, 1998)\n\nLogo: On a white background, we see silhouettes of a film reel and film tape. On top of the background is the word \"fox\" continuously changing colors, with searchlights behind it. Under the \"fox\" searchlights we see a zigzagged line with \"children's productions\" under it.\n\nFX/SFX: The text changing colors, the searchlight and film equipment moving.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The end theme of the show. On Bobby's World, it's silent.\n\nAvailability: Rare. It was seen on season 2 of The Tick, which is available on DVD and was last seen on Toon Disney's Jetix block (now Disney XD) (as a side note, Jetix is what Fox Kids eventually became in 2004, during it's first two years on ABC Family, it had no proper name and was known simply as the \"ABC Family Action Block\"). Also appeared on Life with Louie, seasons 2-5 of Eek! Stravaganza and Bobby's World (which can be seen on Netflix). On Life with Louie reruns on the North American Fox Kids block from 1999 until 2002, this logo was plastered by the 1998-2000 Fox Family Productions logo, due to Fox Kids using a Fox Family print.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(1997-1999)\n\n<embed align=\"bottom\" height=\"175\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/157d2b52e50ea7d49457d87d8b36b801efac410d\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"219\" wmode=\"transparent\"/>\n\nLogo: On a space background, we see the Earth. Then the Earth rapidly gets \"sucked\" in to reveal that the globe is in a kid's eye. We then zoom out to see a bunch of kids faces with the Fox Kids logo in the middle of the screen, with transparent lines moving around the screen.\n\nFX/SFX: The globe moving, the zooming out, and the moving lines.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A fast-paced drum-beat type theme, though on some shows, the end theme plays over it instead.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon if you know where to look. Seen on just about any show Fox Kids produced from 1997 to 1999, like Young Hercules andSaban's Adventures of Oliver Twist. Shows from before 1997 that were still producing new episodes at the time kept the second logo (like Eek! Stravaganza). The easiest place to find this is on R1 DVDs of Goosebumps released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment (but don't expect to find this on VHS releases of it, however, as for whatever reason they use the 20th Television logo instead). Also spotted in some later prints of older shows like Dennis the Menace and Robocop: The Animated Series. Strangely, it was seen on several episodes of Spider-Man: The Animated Series, X-Men, and the 1996 version of The Incredible Hulk on Disney XD.\n\nEditor's Note: None.\n\n4th Logo\n\n(1999-2003)\n\nNicknames: \"Rotating FK Tower\", \"The Beeping Fox Kids\"\n\nLogo: The 1998 \"FOX KIDS\" logo (which consists of the words; in which the \"X\" in \"FOX\" is two yellow searchlights crossing, a homage to the searchlights in the 20th Century Fox logo and rest of the letters are in red.) spins around several times while white circles behind it enlarge and disappear, as if they're being transmitted by a radio tower.\n\nFX/SFX: The logo spinning.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A robotic voice-over saying \"Fox Kids!\" over and over with beeping noises in the background. On a Russian print of the Dennis the Menace cartoon S2 EP9, this has music from the 3rd logo.\n\nAvailability: Rare, though it can be still found if you know where to look. It was last seen on U.S. English-dubbed anime shows on the Fox Kids block, such as Flint the Time Detective, DinoZaurs, Mon Colle Knights, and the Digimon series, among others. It also appeared on the first season of What's With Andy, with the CineGroupe and Saban International logos as well as some earlier second season episodes. Some reruns of older shows, like Inspector Gadget, on Fox Family also had this logo (they distributed the show internationally), in Gadget's case, following the DiC logo. These versions would turn up on This TV from time to time. Strangely, some late season 8 episodes of Bobby's World on Kabillion on Demand has this logo, as well as some season 3 episodes on select DVD-R releases. Otherwise, check your old tapes.\n\nEditor's Note: If you pay close attention, the circles behind the logo repeats itself after the logo almost finishes one rotation.\n\n5th Logo\n\n(February 9-August 24, 2002)\n\nLogo: On a red background with some yellow \"stars\", the 2002 Fox Kids logo (which consists of the 1998 logo in a circle) is seen in the center of the screen. The words \"in association with\" is seen above it. There also seems to be a comet behind the Fox Kids logo.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The end theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. It was only seen on Galidor: Defenders of the Outer Dimension, which hasn't reaired in years and doesn't have any sort of VHS or DVD release.\n\nEditor's Note.: None."
