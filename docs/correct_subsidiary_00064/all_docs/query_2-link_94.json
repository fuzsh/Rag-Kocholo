They didn't buy Fox for the name they brought it for the content. The Fox brand/name has been tainted in the last few years and Disney would rather not be associated with it which is fair enough.\n\nKinda reaffirms what many of us suspected.

The agreement did say Disney had the right to use the \"Twentieth Century Fox\" name under license, but I assume that was for films only.\n\nFor the record, the studio is still legally known as Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.\n\nI'm guessing it was for the TV studios.

Its now happened, so we can say goodbye Fox Studios and all its various similar named entities.\n\nTellingly, a lot of the companies Disney bought that are branded legally under \"21st Century Fox\" or \"Fox\" have been renamed to \"TFCF\" since around March, as if to hide their (former) association with Fox.\n\nIt surprised me that they aren't renaming them under ABC like they did with the Fox Family and Fox Kids affiliated companies.\n\nTellingly, a lot of the companies Disney bought that are branded legally under \"21st Century Fox\" or \"Fox\" have been renamed to \"TFCF\" since around March, as if to hide their (former) association with Fox.\n\nIt surprised me that they aren't renaming them under ABC like they did with the Fox Family and Fox Kids affiliated companies.\n\nMaybe some of it comes down to existing contracts. Or maybe down to content that is being created for other networks. Who knows.\n\nDisney gettin' big...\n\nNice-chart. It certainly does help visualize that theoretically a big five tech giant could gobble up whatever they wanted. Even Disney.\n\nThe ship has somewhat sailed, but I do think Nintendo was the one logical company Disney should have thought about in lieu of Fox. Certainly a much better fit than Twitter, goodness knows why Iger considered that.\n\nIt really would have insulated the company a heck of a lot better during the Pandemic. Such is hindsight - plus their competitor snatched up rights.\n\nNice-chart. It certainly does help visualize that theoretically a big five tech giant could gobble up whatever they wanted.

Its too big of a market not to. The only question will be if its going to be through a major acquisition or not.\n\nLittle late to the party but it looks like Disney is rapidly scrubbing whatever's left of the \"Fox\" name from their acquired businesses as of last week. Went to the New York, Delaware and California business registries and discovered lots of 21CF businesses formerly bearing the \"Fox\" name is now under the not-so-subtle \"TFCF\" initials (i.e. Fox Entertainment Group LLC is now TFCF Entertainment Group LLC), with the rest likely to be re-branded by the end of this month.\n\nMost of the companies still bearing the \"Fox\" name now are those that Fox kept.\n\nIron Fist/Luke Cage/Heroes For Hire/Daughters of the Dragon will now be available for use in less than a year, with Daredevil available in just over 13 months...\n\nIron Fist/Luke Cage/Heroes For Hire/Daughters of the Dragon are now available for Disney to use, Daredevil in just over 2 months, and The Punisher/Jessica Jones in around 5 months if the 2 years since cancellation is correct.\n\nLooks like Disney is really pushing the \"Star\" brand as the de-facto successor to Fox as the Latin American Fox channels are to be re-branded as Star beginning next year.\n\nThat's also the year the license to continue using the \"Fox\" name on 21CF's international assets expires, which means the European, African and Asian networks not already under the Star name could be next to be re-branded.\n\nDisney Renaming Fox Channels In Latin America To Star\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-Ti6HSp7AA0 Earlier this year, Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced that the Walt Disney Company would be launching a new streaming service called “Star” internationally, rather than Hulu. With “Star” including general ...\n\nmakes sense. I imagine hulu will be branded to star sooner than later. And with star being in 100s of countries and with Star and HotStar having more subscribers than netflix/amazon/hbo/hulu/disney+/peacock/apple/comcast combined, Im sure that Disney will be investing heavily into the brand as a whole. Now Disney has a major hub for streaming and will be increasing its Disney presence around the world esp in India. I would bet that if/when disney builds a new park, it would be in india.\n\nmakes sense. I imagine hulu will be branded to star sooner than later.
