        "text": "Paramount released the Gladiator II trailer on Tuesday, just as the studio’s own conquerors were in a conference room across town discussing the twilight of the Roman—sorry, Redstone—empire. In their public comments, including to me on Monday, David Ellison and his financial partner Gerry Cardinale have been purposely vague about their exact plans for New Paramount, instead painting on a thick coat of tech platitudes over the massive challenges facing the business they just acquired.\n\nBut… they know they need to move fast, much more quickly than if they waited around for the government to bless their $8 billion takeover of National Amusements and the controlling stake in Paramount Global. Since Shari’s chosen “office of the C.E.O.” awkwardly articulated a turnaround plan about a week before Skydance bigfooted them, I asked Ellison whether that strategy would stop during the regulatory review, which could take a year or so given the F.C.C. broadcast license changing hands. “That will not stop—and, candidly, cannot stop, given the rapidly changing environment,” he said."
