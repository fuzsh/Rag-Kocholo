Welcome to St. James Episcopal Church! We are so glad you are here. St. James is a vibrant Episcopal faith community in the Lake Highlands neighborhood of Dallas. We are very young, very old, and every age in between. There is room for every gift and every person. We seek to live a common life with Christ as our center. Join us for worship on Sundays at 8am and 10am.
