St. James’ Parish is as diverse as our 300+ years of history. We draw from the Annapolis area and as far south as Calvert County. We have over 325 families and individuals. At the same time we are striving to remain a parish where everyone feels connected and a part of a vibrant Christian Community. Our parish emphasizes “Remembering the Past, Living our faith, and Worshipping into the Future”. In the midst of the Eucharist each Sunday, we clearly proclaim “This is not our table, it is the Lord’s, and everyone is Welcome”. The Eucharist is extended to young and older, for we are all God’s children. We are Sisters and Brothers in Christ and as such it is essential that we relate to each other as a family.
