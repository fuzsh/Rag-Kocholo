Welcome to St. James Episcopal Church. We are glad that you have stopped here and we hope that you can find the information you seek in these pages. If you do not, please click on the Contact¬ù menu and send us a message. We will not put you on an automatic mailing list if you do. We would also welcome a telephone call at 318-445-9845.

St. James is a part of The Episcopal Church (episcopalchurch.org) and the Diocese of Western Louisiana (epiwla.org). We worship using the Book of Common Prayer (bcponline.org) and the Episcopal Hymnal 1982.

As our Bishop, the Rt. Rev. Jacob W. Owensby, PhD, D.D. (jakeowensby.com) has said of this diocese: We are culturally diverse. We are welcoming. We believe in a loving, liberating, and life-giving God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection saved the world. And we know that God loves you with no exceptions. That is a good description for St. James as well.

We are not here to judge: where you came from; what your religious roots are (if any); what your life situation is; or anything else that might feel like it is a test you must pass to come into the church. Come and join us. We will not call embarrassing attention to your visit. We just want to offer St. James as your new church home. And to let you know that you are welcome here.

The peace of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be with you,

The Rev. Canon John Bedingfield

Rector
