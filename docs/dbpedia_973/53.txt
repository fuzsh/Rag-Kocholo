We’re excited to invite you to our back to school shoe drive! We’re gathering new or gently used shoes to support local students who could use a helping hand. Your kind donations will make a big difference in providing kids with the footwear and supplies they need for the school year. Every little bit helps, so please donate what you can for this great cause!
