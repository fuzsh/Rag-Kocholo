        "text": "Britt Mergler\n\nExecutive Assistant & Dance Instructor\n\nBritt began dancing at the age of 3 and made EMC her dance home as a young teenager. While she trained in all styles of dance, her true love has always been ballet.\n\nDuring her years at EMC, she was a student teacher, a member of the Senior Ensemble and a principal dancer in the Susquehanna Youth Ballet.\n\nHer leadership training began under Ciara Driscoll as an assistant in the Kreative Kidz Program, where she learned the skills to run a fun and inspiring class while building a strong foundation of basic skills and movement in her students. Bringing out the confidence in her students and revealing the joy and freedom dance brings is the basis for every class she teaches. Britt believes dance can and should be enjoyed by everyone.\n\nIn 2024, Britt returned to EMC to continue her training as a dance educator, and also join the teaching team in Kreative Kidz and the Elementary Dance Technique Program. Britt is also taking a seat in the Executive Admin Team where she can help bring magical events and experiences to our students and families.\n\nKathy Burns\n\nOffice Manager\n\nKathy has been part of the EMC Team since 2006 and she is the “friendly face” of EMC that our families have grown to know and love. She enjoys interacting with our students in her role as Office Manager and she loves her job!\n\nFun facts: Miss Kathy has a cosmetology teaching license and worked as a barber for many years. She also has a CDL and has worked as a school bus driver.\n\nCurrently, she shares a home with her husband, Monte, and spends her free time riding on the back of a Harley Davidson, kayaking and enjoying sightseeing adventures most weekends.\n\nKathy has three grown children and five grandchildren that she spends time with as much as possible. Her oldest daughter, Ashley was one of EMC’s first dancers in PA and is now running the EMC Spirit Shop on Facebook.\n\nKathy makes it a point to always attend our Holiday Celebration and Spring Concert at the Pullo Center and loves seeing the students grow from year to year.\n\nJamie Ferguson\n\nHuman Resources Director & Music Academy Director\n\nJaime joined EMC in 2010 and is responsible for keeping on top of all the HR needs of our very vibrant and dynamic Team.\n\nJaime holds a Bachelor’s degree from IUP (Indiana University of PA) in Business Marketing and before joining EMC, she had been working in Human Resources for 10 years.\n\nShe lives at home with her husband, Kerry and two beautiful children, Van & Wyn.

She believes that with hard work, dedication and patience anything is possible.\n\nRobin Snyder-Wiencek\n\nFounder and CEO\n\nRobin began her dance training at a small, local studio in Baltimore at the age of three, where she couldn’t get enough of “dance studio life”.\n\nLater, she was fortunate enough to attend the prestigious Baltimore School for the Arts, where she received a proper dance education and a love for teaching.\n\nUpon graduation from high school, Robin attended college briefly, but the entrepreneurial bug bit hard and she jumped at the chance to open her studio when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nIn 1992, at the age of 22, Robin started her studio in a single room studio in Baltimore City. She made many mistakes along the way but with the support of her husband, Walter who joined in and made the dance studio dream his own, the studio soon became a second home to hundreds of children and teens every week.\n\nToday, EMC Performing Arts Studio provides Dance, Music, Theater and AcroGymnastics classes to nearly 1000 weekly enrollments in New Freedom, PA.\n\nAs a founding member of DSO Connect, Robin has been generous in sharing her knowledge and experience with studio owners around the country through this online community and her podcast.\n\nIn the next chapter, Robin hopes to continue to grow the EMC Performing Arts Studio community while also traveling and spending time with her sons, grandchildren and husband wherever their RV may take them.\n\nCarli Kernan\n\nHostess\n\nCarli is a freshman at Susquehannock High School.
