        "text": "The Catholic Church of St. James grew out of a tiny band of committed Catholics who moved into Conway during the 1940s.\n\nFrom very early on it was a racially integrated church, a rarity in the South of that era. After many years of Masses celebrated in various locations by priests from neighboring towns, a church was built by their dedicated efforts, and dedicated in 1961 with Father Henry Burke as first pastor.\n\nGrowth was slow until the 1990's, when South Carolina became a favorite retirement destination for many from the north, south and west. Young people followed as jobs were created, and then from the mid-90's a continued growth of Hispanic Catholics added to the community."
