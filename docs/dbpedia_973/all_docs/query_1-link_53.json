        "text": "President's Palette\n\nIn August of this year the world of watercolor lost the artist that the American Watercolor Society designated a “Living Legend” in 2019, Frank Webb, AWS-DF, NWS. During his more than 70 years as a professional artist and teacher, located in Pittsburgh, PA, Frank had won over 125 major awards and his paintings had been exhibited around the world. He had studied art at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh in the late 1940’s and then later, privately with Edgar Whitney and others. For almost 30 years (1950-79) he ran a successful art business and then retired, focusing his talents on watercolor and by doing that, he passed on his love of the medium to generations of students, thereby enriching the world.\n\nHis inspired teaching generated 5 books on watercolor techniques and I thought that the best way to honor him was to pass on one of his “Convictions” from the book “Webb on Watercolor”(1) that I am now reading. Words of truth, vision and encouragement.\n\n“The job is to communicate life. The world does not really need another picture. It needs your vision of how things could be if they were in order. Perhaps nothing else in this life is so ordered, so splendid, and so complete as a work of art. Through your painting, human life is intensified and handed on to others.”(1)\n\nAs I look back at the paintings of which I am most proud to have done and the paintings (of others) which I admired most in our exhibits, they are always the ones which communicate emotions and feelings - paintings where you actually experience the ambience of the day/place, or the intensity of the emotion expressed, or the touch of the texture - be it fluffy feathers or luscious, dewy fruit or weathered faces and hands. Frank Webb was, oh, so right. Through our art we pass on our own vivid life experiences to share with others. Just look at the winning paintings in the BWS BCPL Hereford Branch exhibit printed on the next pages and read the statements of our Juror, John Brandon Sills, as to why he selected those particular 6 out of all the 95 magnificent paintings hanging there. Better yet, go and experience all of the paintings in person, and choose the ones that speak to you. The show lasts till December 17th so you still have time.\n\nAnd then start thinking about our future exhibits.\n\nSherry Morell\n\nBWS President"
