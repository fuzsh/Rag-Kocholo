        "text": "HISTORY OF ST. AGATHA - ST. JAMES CHURCH\n\nOur original parish was established in 1850 as the Church of St. James the Greater. It was the first Catholic parish in Philadelphia County west of the Schuylkill River. Ground was purchased at 38th and Chestnut Streets and within two years, a church building was erected. Construction of the current building, designed by architect Edwin Forrest Durang, began on October 16, 1881 and was completed in 1887.\n\nThe Church’s interior is simply breath-taking. The neo-Gothic style was modeled from European cathedrals and the stained-glass artist studied those in the famed cathedral of León, Spain.\n\nOur church underwent additions in 1930 and renovations in 2003. Nearby St. Agatha's Church was closed in 1976, and its parish was merged into St. James Church. Now, we have two incredible patron saints to look over and guide our parish.\n\nSt. Agatha (Virgin and Martyr)\n\nFeast Day, February 5\n\nSt. Agatha, also known as Agatha of Sicily, is one of the most highly venerated virgin martyrs of the Catholic Church. It is believed that she was born around 231 in either Catania or Palermo, Sicily to a rich and noble family.\n\nFrom her very early years, the notably beautiful Agatha dedicated her life to God. She became a consecrated virgin, a state in life where young women choose to remain celibate and give themselves wholly to Jesus and the Church in a life of prayer and service. That did not stop men from desiring her and making unwanted advances toward her.\n\nHowever, one of the men who desired Agatha, whose name was Quintianus, because he was of a high diplomatic ranking, thought he could force her to turn away from her vow and force her to marry. His persistent proposals were consistently spurned by Agatha, so Quintianus, knowing she was a Christian during the persecution of Decius, had her arrested and brought before the judge. He was the Judge.\n\nHe expected her to give in to his demands when she was faced with torture and possible death, but she simply reaffirmed her belief in God by praying: \"Jesus Christ, Lord of all, you see my heart, you know my desires. Possess all that I am. I am your sheep: make me worthy to overcome the devil.\" With tears falling from her eyes, she prayed for courage.\n\nPrayer to Saint Agatha: [Mention intention] O Heavenly Father, who raised Agatha to the dignity of Sainthood, we implore Your Divine Majesty by her intercession to give us health of mind, body and soul. Free us from all those things which hold us bound to this earth, and let our spirit, like hers, rise to your heavenly courts. Through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You, forever. Amen.\n\nSt. James the Greater (Apostle and Martyr)\n\nFeast Day, July 25\n\nNothing is known of St. James the Greater's early life, though it has been established that he is the son of Zebedee and Salome and brother of John the disciple.\n\nThe title \"the Greater\" was added to St. James' name to help distinguish him from the Apostle James \"the Less,\" who is believed to have been shorter than James \"the Greater.\"\n\nSaint James the Greater was one of Jesus' first disciples. James was fishing with his father and John the Apostle when Jesus came to the shores of the Sea of Galilee and called for the fisherman, who were unable to catch any fish that day, to dip their nets in the water once again.When the fishermen followed Jesus' instructions, they found their nets full, and after emptying the fish on board, the boats nearly sank from their weight.\n\nLater, James was one of only three called by Jesus to witness his Transfiguration, and when he and his brother wanted to call fire upon a Samaritan town, both were rebuked by Jesus.Following Christ's Ascension, James spread the Gospel across Israel and the Roman kingdom as well. He traveled and spread the Word for nearly forty years in Spain.It is said that one day, as he prayed, The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him and asked him to build her a church, which he did.\n\nPrayer to Saint James the Apostle: O glorious Apostle, St. James, who by reason of thy fervent and generous heart wast chosen by Jesus to be a witness of His glory on Mount Tabor, and His agony at Gethsemane; thou, whose very name is a symbol of warfare of this life and victory: obtain for us strength and consolation in the unending warfare of this life, that, having constantly and generously followed Jesus, we may be victors in the strife and deserve to receive the victor's crown in Heaven. Amen."
