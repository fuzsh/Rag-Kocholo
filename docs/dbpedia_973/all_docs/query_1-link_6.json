        "text": "Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nAs Thanksgiving approaches, I wanted to share with you a couple of thoughts and reminders about our ministries with those who are facing insecurity and hunger. Especially as in the midst of this time when we have to adapt and do just about everything differently. But just because we have to do it differently, doesn’t mean the need isn’t there, and it doesn’t mean that the Church of the Holy Comforter isn’t there either.\n\nACTC Thanksgiving Baskets\n\nEach year the Assistance Center of Towson Churches distributes around 2,000 “Thanksgiving Baskets” to the community through its 40 member churches. CHC has always participated in this project, and your response has always been generous. It has always been a joy to watch your faces as you bring in basket after basket, and then watch as Bob Ash, Joe Escobedo, Pete Hartman and others load car load after car load to make their way to ACTC. Last year you gave 92 baskets. However, as we continue to gather remotely and as it is impractical to collect the baskets on our campus, the leadership has given a monetary donation to ACTC equivalent to 100 baskets on CHC’s behalf. If you would like to contribute to the effort, please make out your checks to CHC and write “Thanksgiving Baskets” in the memo.\n\nFood for Thought\n\nTwo weeks ago, Beth Avil, one of our FFT coordinators, wrote to you about the changes in how we are responding to children at Pot Spring Elementary School who are experiencing food insecurity. Again, CHC has been a leader in this response to the more than 3,000 children in Baltimore County Public Schools who are classified by the school system as in desperate need. The pandemic has exacerbated that need. While we are not able to joyfully bring in our cans, boxes and bags of food, we can do our part to offer aid to the 20 families we are supporting with the $50 gift cards we provide to each family each month. Donations can also be made on the Give page of the CHC website using PayPal, debit or credit card. You will have the option to designate the money towards Food for Thought.\n\nDinners at Mt. Calvary, AME Church\n\nSince Thanksgiving 2015 members of CHC have prepared and served hot, nutritious and delicious meals for our neighbors on the 4th Wednesday of each month. Many are homeless, some are recently unemployed, all have need. Before the pandemic, work began about 4 pm and ended about 7 pm and 50-70 people, including children, came and went through the serving line for dinner.\n\nNow, kitchen work begins at about 1:30-2 pm and lasts till 4:30-5 pm. Over 100 people are now served, but the food is delivered to them by the Mt. Calvary staff as there is no in-person dining. As the time of work has shifted from evening to daytime, many who found joy in this ministry are not available due to work. Our CHC kitchen crew is now down to one person. There are two others from our sister parish St. James in Monkton who help prepare.\n\nIn order to continue this ministry, we need at least one other person to plan and prepare the dinners each month along with our remaining cook. This ministry is funded by donations and your annual pledge to CHC.\n\nClearly, the pandemic has had a negative impact on this ministry. Where once we saw the faces of our neighbors we were serving, we now do not. And for some it is now impossible to participate either because of work schedules or the need to maintain strict social distancing. As both November and December dinners are close to Thanksgiving and Christmas, those meals are provided elsewhere; we do not serve again until January 27th. Here is a wonderful and effective way to serve our neighbors who have been hit hard by this pandemic. If you have any interest in participating, please email me or Michael Curley at mcurley7@me.com."
