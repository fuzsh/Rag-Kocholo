        "text": "St. James Church\n\nThe Catholic population in 1957 was 1500 families. Father Morris began preparations to build a larger church, but, sadly, died before his work was completed. Within a few months, during which time Father Hill served as administrator, Father O’Gorman was appointed as pastor and he continued preparations for the building of the new church. The priests moved into a house on Vincent Street and demolition of the old buildings began. During the building of the new church, the hall became the temporary chapel.\n\nThe designs for the stained glass windows were all envisioned by Father O’Gorman. Three of the windows – the Transfiguration, the Calling of the Apostles to be Fishers of Men, and Christ Raising the Daughter of Jairus from the dead – are massive, compelling works of art. Along the sides of the church, above the Stations of the Cross, are the Ten Commandments, also depicted in stained glass. The new church and rectory were completed in 1961. The church was dedicated on June 18, 1961.\n\nIn 1977, Father Gerald Walker began thirteen years of leadership of St. James. That same year, the bimonthly newsletter, which had been discontinued, began again.\n\nFather Tim Nichols became pastor of St. James in 1990. During his twelve years, he brought many new and wonderful changes. A parish wide census, requiring many manpower hours, was conducted. The result was a registered parish population of 3000 families. The establishment of a pastoral committee enhanced communication between the church leadership and the parish family. In the church, a new state-of-the-art electronic organ replaced the previous organ and a new sound system was installed. The choir area was improved with a new concert piano and staggered choir seating. In addition, all of the pews were refurbished. The parish offices were taken out of the rectory and moved to the former convent across the street, which was completely renovated for this purpose. Finally, the hall was redecorated inside and out, including updating the kitchen. The modernized kitchen became the focus of an effort to feed the homeless in our area. Currently, lunches are provided by a group of volunteers every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. There were also several changes in the school. See below.\n\nIn 2002 a new era began – Father Nichols was reassigned and Father Jim Kavanagh was appointed pastor of St. James. He was assisted in his service by Associate Pastors Father Joe Kammerer and Father Brendan Kearney, and Deacons Richard Shinkle and Bob Miller.\n\nIn 2011, Monsignor Michael Meyers joined the parish as pastor. Father Jim Kavanagh retired and resides at Saint James. Many new ministries are starting and are changing lives and helping the parish grow to spiritual maturity, helping to make Saint James a holy, healthy and vibrant parish community.\n\nParish improvements include a new canopy entry project and upgrades to the doors of the church. These sparkling glass doors, repairs to the St. James Statue, and handrails in the sanctuary improve safety and commitment to providing a welcoming environment for our community.\n\nContinuing the legacy entrusted to us by the sacrifices of previous generations, we have purchased property across Vincent street on the south side of Pacific Coast Highway. This property includes buildings formerly used as churches, offices, and a never completed remodel for an education building. These will be used to allow expansion of current and future ministries, including much needed room for our growing youth and confirmation ministry. Possibilities are endless and as yet undetermined. However, it is clear that this expansion has been ordained by God and we will be open to his spirit as we continue to honor him and deepen our faith. We ask for your prayers in helping us discern the best use of this property to advance knowledge of his kingdom. Would you like to see an adoration chapel? Baby sitting daycare during Mass? Let us know how best to serve your needs.\n\nSt. James (the Greater) Church\n\nThe cornerstone of the new church was laid July 5, 1914, by Reverend Patrick Harnett, Vicar General of the Diocese of Los Angeles. Bishop Thomas James Conaty dedicated St. James Church on November 29, 1914. The architect for the church and rectory was Frank Kegley, and the contractors were parishioners, John Lechner & Sons. Father James O’Callaghan was pastor during the building of the Gothic style church, which cost approximately $30,000. Pews that seated 400 were complemented by the choir section, which allowed for an additional 60 people. The one story church measured 40 x 106 feet. It was made of red brick and had a tile roof. The interior furnishings were golden oak with pine flooring, and the altar was finished in gold and white. The tower was 81 feet high, topped with a 10 foot cross. The bell and statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph were removed from the Dominguez Chapel and placed in the new church.\n\nFather James Deenihan became the next pastor in 1918, followed by Father Thomas King, who took over in 1928. Father King was succeeded by Reverend William Stewart in 1930.\n\nReverend Msgr. George Donahoe assumed the pastorship in 1935. A parish auditorium, constructed of frame and stucco and costing $11,000, was built in 1937 under his direction. It is located on the northeast corner of Vincent Street and Broadway, and is in use today. Many card parties were held as fundraisers, and the Knights of Columbus permitted many activities to take place in their hall, located on part of what is now the Parish Center. While Msgr. Donahoe was in charge a noteworthy event took place. On October 25, 1936, Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli, the Papal Secretary of State, celebrated Mass at St. James; he later became Pope Pius XII.\n\nFather William Forde followed Msgr. Donahoe as pastor. During Father Forde’s tenure (1943 – 1952), the hall and the church’s interior were completely renovated. The church organ, installed circa 1951, was said to be one of the finest in the area.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, the parish population had grown so much that a larger church was considered. During this time, St. James’ boundaries were divided into two parishes, and Msgr. Daniel Collins, pastor 1952- 1954, left St. James to found the new Redondo Beach parish of St. Lawrence Martyr in 1955. A mission church in Hermosa Beach, established when Father Deenihan was pastor, was reclassified and became our Lady of Guadalupe Parish in 1958.\n\nGeneral History\n\nThe first inhabitants of this area were Native Americans. They lived in small villages of less than 100 people each, and subsisted on a diet of fish, small game and acorns. A common term for the natives of this area is the Gabrielenos, derived from the Spanish Mission San Gabriel. A more fitting name is the Tongva, a Native American word.\n\nThe first European settlers to the greater Los Angeles area were the Spanish. In order to establish a Spanish presence in Alta, or southern, California and reward service to the crown, massive land grants were awarded in the 1780s. One of these was given to a soldier named Juan Jose Dominguez. In 1784 he was granted over 75,000 acres, designated the Rancho San Pedro. This is the area we now know as the South Bay, and included the modern day city of Redondo Beach. His nephew, Jose Cristobal Dominguez, eventually retained title to the grant. Cristobal and his wife, Maria de Los Reyes, had ten children. Their eldest son and the executor of the will, known as Manuel, subsequently became the principal figure in the Rancho.\n\nAfter the death of Manuel Dominguez and his wife, Maria Engracia, their land holdings were split between six daughters. Three of the sisters, Susana, Guadalupe, and Maria de Los Reyes Dominguez, inherited portions of the estate, each including individual sections collectively known as the Ocean Tract. In 1889 this coastal tract was sold to the Redondo Beach Improvement Company, founded by Robert Thompson and John Ainsworth. They promoted, developed, and sold land that eventually became the nucleus of the city of Redondo Beach, incorporated in 1892. The name of the city is Spanish for “round,” which refers to the half-round street pattern of the original townsite.\n\nOne of Manuel Dominguez’s heirs, daughter Susana, held the first organized Catholic services in Redondo Beach. Maria Susana Delfina Dominguez was born June 5, 1844, and married Dr. Gregorio del Amo y Gonzalez on February 15, 1890. After living in Los Angeles for a short time, they moved to 618 Esplanade, Redondo Beach, where they lived until 1906. It was in this home that a group of Catholics met in the parlor for prayers and Sunday Mass. A visiting priest from St. Vibiana’s in Los Angeles would arrive to say Mass.\n\nDominquez Memorial Chapel\n\nAs the faithful grew in numbers, it became apparent that the parlor could not continue to serve as the church. The Dominguez children donated the land and the finances for the construction of a church to be built in memory of their parents. A committee was formed to plan the new church. The patron St. James was chosen.\n\nThe architects for the Dominguez Memorial Chapel were Messrs. Edelman and Riccard of Los Angeles, and the contractors were Hartnoll and Cole of Redondo Beach. The chapel was built on an 80 x 100 foot lot and was approached from the west with stairs mounting to heavy oak doors. There were eighteen pews to seat the parishioners. Inside to the right was a staircase leading to the organ gallery, which could accommodate a full choir.\n\nProminently placed in the chapel were statutes, made in Spain, of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph.\n\nWindows on the north and south side of the church memorialized the six Dominguez daughters. A stained glass window in memory of their parents, Manuel and Maria Engracia Dominguez, was positioned in the rear of the chapel. A 22′ high ceiling, which added to the beauty, was made of oak.\n\nAttending the dedication were the Carsons (George and Maria Victoria, a daughter of Manuel Dominguez), the del Amos, the Watsons (James and Dolores, another daughter of Manuel), Bishop Mora, Father Joachim Adam, president of St. Vincent’s College, and the parishioners of the parish, which stretched from Santa Monica to the Palos Verde Peninsula.\n\nTwo bell turrets highlighted the western exterior; one of the bells, dated 1892, is currently hanging outside the western side of St. James Church. It was cast by W. T. Garratt & Co., San Francisco, and weighs 500 pounds.\n\nThe Bishop granted the petition for a resident pastor by sending Father Forthiar, the first pastor of St. James. He served the needs of the people until 1906, when Father Ferrer was assigned. By 1910, the congregation had grown and additional seats were installed in the chapel and a new pastor, Father O’Callaghan, arrived. But it was apparent that a new, larger church was needed, so planning and fund raising began. The population of the city had increased to almost 3,000 citizens, with fifty families registered in the parish. During the building program, Father O’Callaghan was transferred and it fell to Right Reverend Msgr. Nicholas Conneally to complete the new church."
