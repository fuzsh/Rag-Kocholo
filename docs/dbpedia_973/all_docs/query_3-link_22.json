Rob asks members of the Parish to send any questions or comments about the project so far to him at communications@saintteresacatholic.org.\n\nTask 1 - Analyze Properties The goal of this task is to gather background information on the parish properties and review regulatory requirements that they are subject to.\n\nTask 2 – Analyze Buildings The purpose of this task is to inventory the buildings on the subject properties, documenting the spaces within to determine current use and general building condition.\n\nTask 3 - Confirm Program The purpose of this task is to establish a space program that reflects how the Saint Teresa Parish consolidated churches will operate in the future.\n\nTask 4 – Decision Matrix The preparation of a decision matrix will be an important tool in developing an effective and actionable Master Plan that can achieve buy-in from the church community.\n\nTask 5 - Master Plan In order to home in on the most viable sites, we will further develop the test-fits plans started under Task 4 foreach site.\n\nTask 6– Color Renderings The goal of this task is to create compelling renderings of the ultimate recommended master plan to be used for presentations and other collateral material to help gain buy-in from the larger community of Saint Teresa.\n\nTask 7- In-Person Meetings We have provided an allowance for additional conference calls/virtual meetings and/or in-person meetings to be billed on an hourly basis."
