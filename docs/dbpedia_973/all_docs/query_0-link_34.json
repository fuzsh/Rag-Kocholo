        "text": "For other schools with the same name, see St. James School (disambiguation).\n\nPrivate episcopal boarding school\n\nSaint James School is an independent boarding and day school in the U.S. state of Maryland. Founded in 1842 as the College and Grammar School of St. James's, the school is a coeducational college preparatory school and the oldest Episcopal boarding school in the United States founded as a boarding school proper.[citation needed]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint James is the second iteration of a type of school conceived by William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796–1877), who founded model schools on Long Island in 1828 and 1836. The founding Rector of Saint James was John Barrett Kerfoot (1816–1881), who was Muhlenberg's principal disciple for thirteen years before Muhlenberg sent him to Western Maryland to extend the mission. The models established at Flushing and College Point, Long Island, and St. James, Maryland, were the mother lode for much subsequent prospecting. Graduates and staff from Saint James founded St. Paul's (The Rev. Joseph H. Coit, M.A.), Concord, New Hampshire, St. Mark's, Southborough, Massachusetts; and several other schools. Racine College in Wisconsin (1852) was modeled on Saint James, and its celebrated rector, James DeKoven, recruited faculty from Saint James.[citation needed]\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint James is one of twenty-four Episcopal Schools in the Diocese of Maryland.[2] The school is governed by a board of trustees. A Prefect Council, made up of ten seniors elected by the students and the faculty, upholds the traditions of Saint James and assists faculty members and the Headmaster in the school's day-to-day operations. Of this group, one member is elected Senior Prefect, and they lead the Prefects.[citation needed]\n\nThe Sacristans and Chapel Vestry assist in the liturgy of daily services. The Senior Sacristan is the second-ranking position for students on campus, following the Senior Prefect, and is the chief student assistant to the Chaplain, currently the Rev. Dr. Brandt Montgomery. Saint James School is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and the Maryland State Department of Education. The school is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools, the Association of Independent Maryland Schools, Cum Laude Society, the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, and the National Association of Episcopal Schools.[citation needed]\n\nSex abuse\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1980s, several boarding students were sexually abused by Father Kenneth Behrel, a teacher. The school dismissed Behrel. Prosecutors in a trial that eventually resulted in Behrel's imprisonment found that the school bore some responsibility.[3][4]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint James School is situated in a rural area. The Georgian-style buildings are in 100 acres (0.40 km2) farmland containing a natural spring, fields, and streams. Total acreage exceeds 800 acres. The school lies 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Hagerstown and is approximately 70 miles (110 km) from both Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nClaggett Hall: The largest boys' dorm on campus, Claggett houses over 60 fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-formers and several faculty members.\n\nKemp Hall: The campus student center.\n\nPowell Hall: The main academic building with over 20 classrooms.\n\nJohn E.

Prehn Collection in the Saint James School Archives is a growing resource for studying the Church school movement on both sides of the Atlantic and high-quality faith-based education. The Collection features original primary documents or copies thereof related to W.A. Muhlenberg's model schools on Long Island; documents useful for the study of the schools founded by Muhlenberg's proteges, especially Kerfoot, Lloyd Breck, and Henry Coit of St. Paul's; histories of prep schools in the United Kingdom and the United States; biographies of Church school headmasters and other staff; and articles and monographs addressing the historical context and conditions in which the pan-Atlantic Church school arose. In this Collection, the researcher may better understand the relationship between the 19th-century \"Church Revival\" and the school-founding phenomenon.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
