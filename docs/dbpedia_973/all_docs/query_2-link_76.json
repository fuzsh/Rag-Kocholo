With those objections withdrawn by 1906, Father E. Earle Willett was appointed the first pastor, just four days before the first Mass was offered on September 7. Father Willett, pastor for forty-eight years, developed the habit of traveling the parish on foot, visiting families on their front porches.\n\nTen days after the first Mass, a school, staffed by the Ursuline Sisters of Mount St. Joseph, opened with thirty students. The parish quickly outgrew the church and school, and construction began for new church, dedicated in 1913, and a new school, dedicated in 1924. Today, committed lay teachers staff the school and an early childhood development program, established in 1996. Both operate at capacity enrollment.\n\nThe Louisville Landmarks Commission nominated the church, rectory, and school in 1980 for listing in the National Register of Historic Places Inventory. The parish clustered with St. Brigid in 1994.\n\nThe two parishes collaborate in outreach programs, including the St. Vincent de Paul Society, Highlands Community Ministries, Dare to Care, and many other charitable endeavors in the community; also with other area churches in Habitat for Humanity. They share staff but operate independently, and neither parish has lost its identity."
