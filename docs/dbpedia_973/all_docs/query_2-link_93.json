        "text": "Pastor, Fr. Vincent Clemente\n\nFather Vincent came to the United States from Italy at the age of 15, where his family settled in the Cleveland, OH area. He has one sister. Father was ordained to the priesthood on May 8, 1976 and has previously served at St. Martha’s in Sarasota, FL and as pastor of St. Michael in Wauchula and St. Paul in Arcadia.\n\nWELCOME, FATHER! We look forward to continued spiritual growth with you here at St. James!\n\nParochial vicar Fr. Felix Gonzalez\n\nFr. Felix Gonzalez, our newest parochial vicar, was born in Venezuela on September 18, 1953. He studied philosophy in Trinidad & Tobago, West Indies and theology at the Seminary “Santa Rosa de Lima,” Caracas, Venezuela. He was ordained on July 18th, 1981 at the .Archdiocese of Barquisimeto. He came to the United States 20 years ago and studied monastic spirituality in Worcester, MA and worked in different parishes in the Archdiocese of New York— Manhattan and the Bronx. During those years he studied in IONA College and graduated with a Masters in Science, majoring in pastoral counseling. After serving St. Leo for almost two and a half years, he is happy to embark on this new part of his spiritual journey.\n\nOur commitment to a Safe Environment\n\nAs Christian adults, we have a moral and legal responsibility and are entrusted by God with the spiritual, emotional and physical well-being of minors and vulnerable adults.

Alluding to the book of Exodus, Jesus treats their response as rebellious grumbling (6:43). The Father works within people by teaching them and drawing them to faith in Jesus (6:44-45). Jesus encourages His followers to yield to God’s teachings and thus, come to the Son, the only one who knows and reveals the Father. By believing in Jesus and receiving Him, one receives the gift of eternal life. (6:46-47).\n\nJohn identified some within Jesus’ audience as His neighbors. They challenged Jesus’ claim to have come down from heaven, because they knew of His father, Joseph, and mother, Mary. They are thinking primarily in earthly terms and not the heavenly terms to which Jesus is summoning them (6:27).\n\nJesus does not regard these as innocent questions but as murmuring. This Greek word describes the rebellious grumbling of the Israelites against the Lord (and Moses) in the wilderness (Exod. 17:3; Num. 14:26-35). In effect, Jesus is telling His listeners that their hearts are hardened like those who murmured in the desert, and to whom Moses declared, “Your grumbling is not against us, but against the Lord” (Exod. 16:8 LXX).\n\nJesus again points to the truth; No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him on the last day. Developing His earlier remarks about God’s work in 6:29,37, Jesus speaks of the Father as working to bring people to faith in Him. He instructs them to yield to His “work of God” and so receive the gift of eternal life through faith in Him.\n\nJesus supports this claim with the prophets, freely citing Isa. 54:13: They shall all be taught by God. Being taught by God involves listening to the Father, yielding to Him, and thus being brought to Jesus. The Father’s action is secret and hidden, but it has an attracting power to bring us to the Son, the one who is from God, and who alone has seen the Father. Only the “Son, who is at the Father’s side” (1:18) can truly reveal the Father (see Mat. 11:25-27).\n\nJesus distinguishes the connection between receiving Him in faith and receiving the gift of eternal life: Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. All people have access to God’s gift of eternal life through Jesus. We receive this gift through faith in Him.\n\nJesus spoke of “food that endures for eternal life” (6:27) and then was challenged by the crowd to perform a sign greater than the manna (from heaven while in the desert) (6:30-31). Jesus went on to speak of the “bread of God. . . which comes down from heaven” (6:33) and identified Himself as this heavenly “bread of life” (6:35). His discourse now crescendos in the revelation that the bread from heaven that gives eternal life is the crucified and glorified flesh of Jesus Himself (6:48-51). With strong realism, Jesus teaches that He gives this very flesh as nourishment to believers in the Eucharist, which is the sacrament of His body and blood (6:53-58).\n\nReturning to the themes of manna and life-giving bread, Jesus compares Himself as the bread of life with the manna. The manna was a providential gift from the Lord to sustain the Israelites in the wilderness. But despite the wondrous nature, the manna did not give eternal life: Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died. But the bread of life from heaven does what the manna could not. It gives eternal life. So, whoever eats this bread will live forever.\n\nThe food that gives immortality is an allusion to the tree of life in the garden of Eden. According to Genesis, the tree of life’s fruit could give immortality. But, after their sin, God expelled Adam and Eve from Eden to keep them from eating this food (Gen 3:22-23).\n\nYet, Jesus now says that anyone who eats the bread He gives will live forever.\n\nJesus opens the way to paradise and offers the food that gives immortality.\n\nYours in Christ,\n\nFr. Vincent Clemente"
