        "text": "UPDATE 02/1/2024: The Archdiocese of Baltimore filed for bankruptcy in September 2023. As a result, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Michelle M. Harner has set a deadline of May 31, 2024, for filing childhood sexual abuse claims against the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Despite the removal of the statute of limitations outlined in the Child Victims Act, time is now limited to file a claim. Contact our attorneys today for a free and confidential consultation.\n\nThe Maryland Attorney General’s Office has released a lengthy 463 page report on child sexual abuse in the Archdiocese of Baltimore, identifying 146 priests, deacons, seminarians and others credibly accused of sexual assault in the Catholic Church.\n\nAs advocates for justice, our Maryland Sexual abuse lawyers have compiled two databases that allow you to search for:\n\nPlease note, the databases only list Catholic priests accused of abuse in the Maryland Attorney General’s Office report. If you were the victim of child sexual abuse by someone not listed below, you can still file a lawsuit. Contact our lawyers for a free consultation.\n\nCONTACT OUR MARYLAND ABUSE LAWYERS\n\nAttorney General Releases Catholic Priests Sex Abuse Report\n\nThe Maryland Attorney General launched an investigation into the Catholic Church of Baltimore in 2018, following hundreds of credible allegations of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests and other church officials.\n\nThroughout the investigation, more than 300 victims and witnesses came forward to share their experiences with investigators about the persistent abuse throughout the Baltimore Archdiocese.\n\nAfter a four year long investigation, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown released a redacted version of the Baltimore Archdiocese sex abuse report on April 5, 2023. The report detailed over 600 cases of sexual abuse allegations against 146 priests, deacons, seminarians, and laymen, who were either accused of sexual assault or helped to cover it up.\n\nAttorney General Anthony Brown stated that the goal of Baltimore Archdiocese investigation was to uncover the truth about the extent of sex abuse in Maryland, and to hold church officials and the organizations responsible accountable for their actions.\n\nAs part of the state’s efforts to allow victims to hold their abusers accountable, Governor Wes Moore signed the Maryland Child Victims Act into law just six days after the Archdiocese report was released. The new law removes the statute of limitations for filing sex abuse lawsuit in Maryland, and significantly increases the Maryland Child Sex Abuse lawsuit settlement caps.\n\nWhich Priests Are Accused of Sex Abuse in Baltimore?\n\nThe Baltimore Archdiocese report names 146 church officials accused of sexual abuse, many of whom were priests, deacons, and church staff. While the report lists 156 total abusers, 10 of the names have been redacted by the order of a Baltimore Circuit Court judge.\n\nThe Maryland Attorney General’s Office found many of these clergy members facing abuse allegations were quickly transferred to other parishes or schools in the state by church leaders, sometimes multiple times."
