As a church community we work for the social justice and a worship-centered faith, to make the Incarnate Word real to a 21st century world.\n\nOur congregation consists of families and individuals; young and old; city folk and suburbanites; white and people of color; people of all sexual and gender identities. All of God's children are accepted and loved at St Monica and St James. We take pride in our diversity as people and our oneness in the Holy Spirit.\n\nOur diverse backgrounds remind us to make no peace with oppression but to see God's image in each other. We are committed to compassion and justice in our society. In our worship, the Mass, celebrated with timeless word and tradition, binds us to God and to one another. Our spiritual community constantly seeks new ways to deepen worship and liturgy and to invoke its power for transforming lives, in our individual action, collective ministries and worldwide engagement.\n\nWe seek to worship God and proclaim Jesus Christ's love through our traditions, our diversity and inclusiveness, our individual and collective ministries, and the world's communities.\n\nWe strive to continue the Gospel's call to love others as God first loved us."
