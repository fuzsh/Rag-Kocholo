        "text": "Mystery Worshipper: Paterfamilias\n\nChurch: St James Cathedral\n\nLocation: Seattle, Washington, USA\n\nDate of visit: Sunday, 23 February 2020, 10:00am\n\nWhat was the name of the service?\n\nMass.\n\nHow full was the building?\n\nThree-quarters full. The congregation were racially and generationally diverse.\n\nDid anyone welcome you personally?\n\nI was attending with my wife and brother-in-law. As soon as we entered, an usher asked, ‘Where are you folks from?’ We replied, ‘Michigan,’ and he then said, ‘Wonderful! I've been looking for three folks from Michigan to carry the gifts in procession at the offertory. Can you folks do that?’ We replied that we would be happy to, and he gave us some simple instructions. When the time came for us to fulfill our appointed tasks, he grinned and said, ‘Now don't screw it up.’ After mass, he came by our pew and thanked us for taking part in the service.\n\nWas your pew comfortable?\n\nQuite.\n\nHow would you describe the pre-service atmosphere?\n\nA bit of chatter.\n\nWhat were the exact opening words of the service?\n\nAfter the opening hymn, the pastor said that before mass began, he wanted to address a situation at the local Catholic high school (two faculty members who had announced that they were going to enter into a same-sex marriage were dismissed from their positions). The pastor noted that many of the students at the school were confused and upset, and that ‘the Church has a lot of catching up to do.’ Then he invited us to begin the mass with: ‘In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.’\n\nWhat books did the congregation use during the service?\n\nA printed order of service, quite nicely designed and easy to use.\n\nWhat musical instruments were played?\n\nA four manual pipe organ designed by Manuel Rosales Organ Builders, a Los Angeles firm. There is a second organ in the west gallery (by Hutchings-Voley), not used in this service.\n\nDid anything distract you?\n\nThe Kyrie, Gloria, and Agnus Dei were from the plainsong Missa de Angelis. The Kyrie was unusual, as it was not three-fold or nine-fold, but four-fold (using the first, fourth, seventh, and ninth petitions: Kyrie, Christe, Kyrie, Kyrie). In addition, each petition was sung in Greek by the choir, but then extended by an English ‘have mercy on us’ for the congregation. The Agnus Dei was similarly extended. Odd.\n\nWas the worship stiff-upper-lip, happy clappy, or what?\n\nHigh, but neither archaic nor stuffy. Much of the service was chanted (and the pastor chants beautifully). Four torches accompanied the gospel to the ambo. Bells were rung at the elevations during the institution narrative. There were two offertory processions: one in the east nave, one in the west nave.\n\nExactly how long was the sermon?\n\n9 minutes.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, how good was the preacher?\n\n10 — The pastor is a superb public speaker.\n\nIn a nutshell, what was the sermon about?\n\nHe based his sermon on the gospel for the day (Matthew 5:38-48 – ‘an eye for an eye’). He recalled an event where he went to hear a Muslim physician speak; the speaker’s daughters had died in a senseless act of violence in Israel. His response was to write a book entitled I Shall Not Hate. The pastor said he found the physician's talk one of the best sermons on Jesus' teaching he had ever heard. Too often we do not forgive, but instead pay back in kind, and thus make matters worse. He then noted that the Washington State Legislature was taking a look at the death penalty. He felt it was sad that Catholics are just as likely as the general public to support the death penalty, and emphatically stated that no Catholic can support the death penalty. We must break the endless cycle of revenge and retaliation.\n\nWhich part of the service was like being in heaven?\n\nThe choral singing, especially the excerpt from Bloch's Sacred Service and SS Wesley's ‘Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace.’ And the pastor's homily.\n\nAnd which part was like being in... er... the other place?\n\nFive members from the confirmation class presented five ‘reflections’ at various points in the service. In general, I'm not fond of these didactic moments being inserted into a celebratory liturgy. I must say, though, that these young people had been very carefully prepared and read their assigned texts clearly and distinctly.\n\nWhat happened when you hung around after the service looking lost?\n\nThe usher who had recruited us for the offertory procession came over and thanked us. He was most welcoming. And I had the chance to chat with the pastor briefly.\n\nHow would you describe the after-service coffee?\n\nThere was none. We went to the cathedral bookstore and looked around a bit.\n\nHow would you feel about making another visit (where 10 = ecstatic, 0 = terminal)?\n\n10 — In a dozen or so years of Mystery Worshipping, I don't think I have ever encountered a church where seemingly everything – music, preaching, liturgy – showed such careful preparation. When I return to Michigan, I will begin looking for another excuse to visit Seattle.\n\nDid the service make you feel glad to be a Christian?\n\nIndeed.\n\nWhat one thing will you remember about all this in seven days' time ?\n\nThe usher telling us, ‘Now don't screw it up.’"
