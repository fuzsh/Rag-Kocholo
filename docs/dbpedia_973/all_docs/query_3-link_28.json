        "text": "1887\n\nBishop Potter dies and is succeeded by his nephew, The Rt. Rev. Henry Codman Potter, who begins to solicit financial support for construction of the Cathedral.\n\nAn 11.5-acre site is acquired for the Cathedral atop the plateau known as Morningside Heights.\n\n1911\n\nConsecration of the Chapel of St. Columbia, the Great Choir and the Crossing.\n\nRalph Adams Cram is hired to complete the Cathedral.\n\nThe Very Rev. William Mercer Grosvenor is named the Cathedral’s first Dean.\n\n1984\n\nThe Cathedral hosts the first annual Feast of Saint Francis and Blessing of the Animals. The service includes the music of Artist in Residence Paul Winter and Paul Halley’s Missa Gaia/Earth Mass. Saint Francis Day continues to be one of the largest services at the Cathedral, drawing visitors from all over the world.\n\nInauguration of The American Poets Corner in the Arts Bay, dedicated to American writers.\n\nEdwina Sandys’ Christa, a sculpture of a female Christ on a crucifix, is displayed during Holy Week and taken down early after causing a small but historical controversy. The piece returns to the Cathedral as part of The Christa Project in 2016.\n\n2005\n\nMore than 1,000 people fill the Crossing for an anti-war rally to hear activist Cindy Sheehan on the Bring Them Home Now Tour.\n\nPost-fire cleaning and restoration of the Cathedral’s interior begins in the east end and chapels.\n\n2006\n\nThe Cathedral enters into an agreement with a real estate investment trust, leasing land for the construction of a residential building with twenty percent affordable housing units to the south of the Cathedral.\n\nRestoration and the removal of scaffolding renders the upper 55 feet of the South Tower visible for the first time in 15 years.\n\n2008\n\nThousands of people attend a rededication service and celebration in honor of the reopening of the entire length of the Cathedral. Guests at the service include New York Senators Hillary R. Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, Cardinal Edward Egan, and firefighters who battled the 2001 fire.\n\n2011\n\nThe Value of Water: Sustaining a Green Planet opens, ushering in a new wave of large-scale art exhibitions, including Jane Alexander: Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope) (2013), The Phoenix Project: Xu Bing at the Cathedral (2014), The Value of Food (2015-2016), The Christa Project (2016-2017), and The Value of Sanctuary (2019).\n\nThe Cathedral reestablishes its gift shop for the first time since the fire in the 2001.\n\nThe Cathedral commemorates the ten-year anniversary of 9/11 by offering “A Day of Community, A Day of Faith,” which includes four services, a “Spotlight on Spirit” tour, and music, readings, and messages of hope from local, national, and international guests.\n\nMusic Director Kent Tritle revives the “Great Music in a Great Space” program, an annual series of choral, organ, and orchestral concerts.\n\n2017\n\nThe Cathedral is officially designated a historic landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nNewly restored baroque tapestries are installed for the first time for the exhibition The Barberini Tapestries: Woven Monuments of the Baroque Rome.\n\nAretha Franklin gives her final public performance as part of the twenty-fifth anniversary celebration of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nThe annual Cathedral Craft Fair, sponsored by the Congregation, moves after twenty-five years from Synod Hall to the Cathedral itself, becoming a signature program.\n\n2018\n\nPhase one of renovation of the North Transept is complete.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Clifton Daniel III is installed as the tenth Dean.\n\nThe Cathedral celebrates the 125th anniversary of the laying of its cornerstone with a special evensong on November 18th. During the service, the Most Rev. Michael Curry, the 27th Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church, is seated in the International Ecumenical Cathedra and preaches his message of love."
