        "text": "Farrand & Votey\n\nDetroit, Mich. – Opus 791 (1895)\n\nElectro-pneumatic action\n\n3 manuals, 31 stops, 36 ranks\n\nIn 1895, Farrand & Votey rebuilt the 1889 Roosevelt organ as their Opus 791. Farrand & Votey retained the Roosevelt chests, but installed electro-pneumatic action to activate the primary valves. The couplers were converted to electric action, and three couplers added. An 8' Dulciana (with pipes marked \"Dolce\") replaced the 2-2/3' Octave Quint on the Great. Farrand & Votey also installed an automatic player mechanism in a niche behind the music rack, but it is no longer extant. A Spencer blower was added about 1914, replacing the original Judson water motor.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the organ building firm of Glück New York has been working to restore the organ, retaining the electrical action added in 1895 by Farrand & Votey. To date, the case has been leveled and several stops are again playable. Additional restoration work will occur as funding becomes available.\n\nOn October 13, 2008, the Organ Historical Society awarded its distinguished Historical Citation No. 369 in recognition of the Roosevelt Organ as an outstanding example of organbuilding and worthy of preservation. Frank Roosevelt\n\nNew York City – Opus 421 (1889)\n\nTracker-pneumatic action\n\n3 manuals, 31 stops, 36 ranks\n\nThe 1889 Frank Roosevelt organ in St. James Church was one of many recorded by F.R. Webber (1887-1963), a noted organ historian whose \"Organ Scrapbooks\" are in the possession of The Organ Historical Society Archives in Princeton, N.J. Click here to view the notebook page. Webber writes the following comments:\n\n\"The organ was built by Mr. Hilborne L. Roosevelt, but its original date and number are not listed in the Roosevelt literature. It was either rebuilt or else enlarged in 1889 by Frank Roosevelt. The rectangular, ivory nameplates of both Hilborne L. and Frank Roosevelt are on the console.\n\n\"Metal pipes in flats are displayed on the front of the case, with a flat of wood pipes at either end. The console is of the usual handsome appearance of the later Roosevelt work, and the ivory discs are engraved in the characteristic Roosevelt special lettering.\"\n\nAs noted in The Music Trade Review (1889, vol. 13, no. 5, p. 116), the organ included a novel combination action:\n\n\"Romaine Callender, for many years an organist of Brantford, Ont., has perfected an invention whereby he claims to have brought the control and manipulation of the stops of the largest organs to a higher degree of perfection than has hitherto been reached. It has been introduced into a new organ just erected in St. James' Roman Catholic Church, N.Y. The organist, at any movement, by simply touching with the tips of his fingers a slender horrizontal [sic] bar placed over each set of keys, brings out an entirely new set of stops without removing either hand from the keyboard or interrupting, even for a second, the rendition of the music before him. By a most ingenious contrivance he sets beforehand the various consecutive combinations of stops which he intends to use during his performance, and as he touches the bar these combinations present themselves in their proper order and at the exact moment required. The organ at St. James' is a Roosevelt, costing $10,000. It will be heard for the first time at a public recital to-morrow evening, Oct. 6 [1889], in the church at James street and New Bowery.\"\n\nMusic for the dedicatory recital was furnished by William E. Mulligan, organist at St. James' Church.\n\nThe following specifications are from a Roosevelt Organ Works publication."
