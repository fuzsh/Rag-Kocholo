        "text": "WELCOME to St. James Episcopal Church\n\nof Saint James, New York\n\n​490 North Country Road. St James, NY 11780​\n\n​We're not perfect Christians - no one is.\n\nWe're not holier than anybody else.\n\nWe're not here to impose our will on others.\n\nHow can we if we're continually trying to figure out God's will for us?\n\nWe are weak. We are sinners. We all struggle.\n\nBut above all, we know that we are loved by God... and so are you.\n\nRegardless of what you look like, who you're attracted or married to,\n\nwho you vote for, or anything else,\n\nGOD LOVES YOU\n\nand wants to be loved by you.\n\nSo if you feel there's a void in you that nothing in the world can fill,\n\nif you're lonely, unloved, rejected,\n\nor if you feel a tremendous love that you need to share,\n\njoin us.\n\nJoin us in celebrating the God who loves us so much\n\nthat he sent his Son Jesus to redeem us from all our sins and sorrows,\n\nto become one with us,\n\nto teach us how to love as God loves,\n\nand to die for us so that we can live\n\nin him, for him, and for you and all the world.\n\nBeloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us. 1 John 4:11-12\n\nThe Church's God-given mission statement:\n\nTo love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength; and to love our neighbors as ourselves. ​Matthew 22:37-40\n\n​\n\nJoin us in worship. You're very welcome!\n\nNOTE:\n\nMasks are optional. Please respect those who continue to mask.\n\nIt's awfully quiet before the service! That's to allow everyone to spend time in prayer as we prepare for the Lord to come to us .\n\nThe Holy Eucharist (aka Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper, the Mass) is our usual form of worship. If you're baptized, then you've been \"sealed by the Holy Spirit... and marked as Christ's own for ever\" (The Book of Common Prayer baptism service). So you are warmly invited to receive the Body and Blood of Christ. If you're not baptized, you're welcome to come forward to receive a blessing, or you're free to remain in your seat. Either way, you'll be blessed simply by worshiping God.\n\nHoly Communion is once again being given in both kinds, i.e. the Bread and the Cup . However, following current COVID guidelines, the Priest will dip the Bread in the Cup and hand it to you. Or you may choose to receive the Bread only.\n\n​\n\nWorship on Sundays\n\n8:00 a.m. The Holy Eucharist, Rite 1 (Traditional \"thee/thou/thy\" language)\n\n9:30 a.m. The Holy Eucharist, Rite 2(Contemporary \"you/your\" language)\n\nThe children receive Holy Communion before everyone else, then go to Godly Play\n\nThe 9:30 service is also LIVE-STREAMED\n\nYou don't have to be a Facebook subscriber to join the service. It stays online for a month.\n\nJoin us for Coffee Hour following the 9:30 servicein Mills Hall across the driveway from the church.\n\nTuesdays through Fridays\n\n8:30 a.m.: Morning Prayer, Rite 1\n\nHOLY DAYS As announced\n\n​Community Coffee Hour: Wednesdays at 10AM\n\nJoin us for coffee, bagels, and great company. All are welcome!\n\nBooks & Things Thrift Store\n\nWednesdays from 10:00AM-Noon and as announced for special events\n\nCome shop at our Books & Things shop for treasures at low prices! We offer all kinds of items: framed art, china, books, home decor, puzzles and games, children's items, and more. We also accept donations of such items: please visit during open hours for donations or call the church office to arrange a time for drop off."
