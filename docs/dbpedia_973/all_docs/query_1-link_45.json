        "text": "by Patrick Smithwick\n\nWinner of a Life Well Spent\n\nFamily, horses, Atlanta Hall Farm, a fast car and piles of good history books – that was the formula. It was a hard-driving lifestyle and as Tom got older, instead of sloughing some of it off, he added on. The man liked to work. Yet, for a visitor, it would be difficult to differentiate the work from the play.\n\nIn the early winter, Tom would get up at 5:30 on a Saturday morning, say Christmas Eve, have a cup of instant coffee, head to the barn, stand in front of a chart of 35 horses hanging outside on the wall, and scratch his hieroglyphics for what each horse is doing that day and what set each is going out on, match the right horse with the right rider, some sets going to the indoor track – trot three, gallop four, then turn and gallop five the other way; some later in the morning going to the synthetic outdoor track – he’d be there in the pickup to look over each horse as the riders circled, and then give out the orders; six of the young hurdle horses are just starting in work; they need the long jog around the perimeter of the Elkridge-Harford timber course.\n\nSets of three or four are tacked up and head out. Then, it goes into fast mode. Tom starts the van. Backs it up to the wall. Grooms finish brushing off the hunters, painting their feet. An amateur timber rider gallops his fourth horse, yanks off his blue jeans, pulls on his britches and hunting boots alongside two giggling galloping girls who are changing into their foxhunting attire in the old pine-panelled tack room festooned with show ring ribbons from the ’40s and ’50s. Clean legged, trace clipped, strong backed horses are loaded up – star professional jockey drives the van to the joint meet. Horses are unloaded. Who are these horses? Welter Weight, Florida Law, Iron Fist, Sam Sullivan – who between the four of them, will go on to win the Grand National, the Maryland Hunt Cup, the Virginia Gold Cup, the My Lady’s Manor, and many other races. It is the execution of this regimen, never missing a day, that will get them to the winner’s circle.\n\nThey hunt for two hours. Tom hops off Florida Law, steps into the van, changes clothes, and rushes to Laurel Park, where another van has brought a flat horse. He runs the horse and drives back to Atlanta Hall, calling his owners on the way, preparing to send one flat horse up to Aqueduct to run on Tuesday and another down to Florida. At the farm, he meets the van from Laurel, unloads the horse, slaps a poultice on the front legs, throws on a blanket, feeds him a hot mash, gives him a pat on the neck, and rushes up to his and his wife Mimi’s annual Christmas Eve party to which they’ve invited most of My Lady’s Manor.\n\nIf ever a man lived by the theme of a poem written by Robert Frost, a poet Tom loved –\n\n“…My object in living is to unite\n\nMy avocation and my vocation…”\n\n– it was Tom Voss.\n\nIf he’d been a tennis player, the sports writers would have noted, “Like Tilden, he played the whole court.” If he’d been a writer, the critics would have asserted, “He was a writer of the 19th Century European mold, seldom seen in America, working in all genres.”\n\nHorses were Tom’s passion, but he did not have a narrow focus. He thrived training both steeplechase and flat horses. In the steeplechase world, where there is a division between timber horses and hurdle horses, Tom trained both. In short, Tom was a “horseman.” That was the plain, Anglo-Saxon term of which he was most proud. As a teenager, beginning his career, he liked that title the most. We were horsemen.\n\nBecoming The Horseman\n\nWhat does it mean to be a horseman?\n\n“Why does Tom matter?” I was asked, and “What does he mean for the average horse person with little or no knowledge of hunting, racing or the Voss family?” First, we can learn from the education of Tom Voss.\n\nHow did Tom become a horseman? Did he take a course at college in horsemanship? No such courses being offered then. Anyway, Tom started far earlier than college age. Earlier than high school.\n\nHe began as a child going on cross-country rides with my mother, Suzie Smithwick. He’d be on Pepper. I’d be on Queenie. He was soon hunting Pepper under the tutelage of that tough taskmaster, Walter “Wassie” Ball, who ran the hunting stable of Tom’s grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. E. S. Voss. Wassie taught Tom everything he knew, the old proven ways, about horses and foxhunting, protected and frustrated him by doing too much hilltopping and not the running and jumping Tom wanted to do. The strait-laced Mrs. Dean (Louise) Bedford, founder and first president of the United States Pony Club, had her eye on Tom. She was all about, “That throat latch is too tight…. Your stock’s not tied right…. Sit up straight in the saddle,” at the meet. But oh Lord! When the hunt hit a lull, she’d take us out running and jumping, galloping through streams, clattering across roads, all the while teaching us about foxes, hounds, hawks, the way the breeze was blowing, why the ground would not hold a scent. Soon, Tom started acquiring a horse or two, another pony, “Itch,” and keeping them at his mother’s barn. Immediately, Virginia horseman Emmett Grayson, who had worked for Tom’s father, was living in the barn, rubbing the horses, and every single day bestowing his thirty years of racetrack knowledge upon Tom.\n\nAt 16, Tom started working in the mornings before school, on the weekends, over summers and vacations for my father, Hall of Famer A. P. “Paddy” Smithwick, who was launching his racing stable after recuperating from a devastating fall in a hurdle race. At 17, Tom was training his own timber horse, Suspendido, along with Wassie, and riding him in Maryland timber races. At 18, he toured Irish stud farms, galloped and schooled for the legendary trainer, Dan Moore, rode out with champion jockey Tommy Carberry. Tom worked for my father – on the farm in Maryland, at Pimlico, at Delaware Park, at Saratoga – galloping, schooling over timber and hurdles, mucking out stalls, driving the van, putting on bandages. He was reading the condition book, studying the Racing Form, entering horses at the racing secretary’s office. He did this until he was 20 and began running horses under his own name, and riding them as an amateur in timber and hurdle races.\n\nThere is a lesson here. In steeplechasing, young jockeys need to know what they are doing before they ride in a point-to-point. They need to pay their dues. I’ve been to countless point-to-points when I’ve seen Tom look at a horse and rider in the paddock, give me a glance, and we’ve both known that neither that horse nor that rider should be going to the post. Not only can they get hurt, they can hurt others.\n\nThe same goes for trainers. A trainer is responsible for the well-being of both his horse and rider. No short cuts can be taken. Either the horse and rider are ready to race, or they are not. How does a trainer learn this? How does a rider learn this? There’s only one way, through years of apprenticeship with the best.\n\nThat’s what Tom received and then gave. By the time he was in his forties, freshmen matriculated into Voss University throughout the year – young riders, young grooms, kids whose families had thrown them out – and a few seasons later graduated with a Voss Degree.\n\nThe Graduates\n\n“I arrived in Maryland with $26,000 worth of credit card debt, didn’t have an idea of what I was going to do. I was talking to Tom one night and he said, ‘See you at the barn in the morning,’ one trainer told me after Tom’s funeral. “Tom gave me that break I needed.”\n\n“I was just off the boat,” an Englishman related, “I’d gotten too big to ride races in England but I was still light enough to gallop. There I was – completely lost at Saratoga, walking around the Annex one morning. Tom asked what I was doing. I told him I didn’t have an… idea.”\n\n“ ‘Get on the van going to Maryland at the end of the week,’ Tom said. ‘Mimi’ll find you a place to live. You’ll be galloping for me.’ ”\n\n“Tom saved my life,” a middle-aged man from Concord, Massachusetts, who owns a successful paving and construction company, proclaimed. “I was 12 and going nowhere. My parents had just gone through a tough divorce. I was dropped off at Tom and Mimi’s house when Tom was training at Rockingham Park. Every morning, 5:30 sharp, I heard, ‘Boy, time to get up.’ We’d have coffee, drive to the track without saying a word. Tom would park, then ‘OK boy, get to work.’ I was mucking out stalls and walking hots. In the afternoons, I came back, hayed and fed, whirlpooled horses. I owe the success of my career to Tom; he taught me that with hard work, you can do anything.”\n\nThe list goes on. Irish jockeys, English jockeys – some riding races, others now training; some in the U.S.A., others back in the old country – regaled friends with stories of how Tom gave them their first shot and launched their careers.\n\nWhat did these graduates learn at Voss University? They learned how to work hard and how to treat a horse. Tom’s horses, stabled most of the year at Atlanta Hall, live the good life. Fed at 4:30 a.m. Turned out in paddocks and porta-paddocks from 5:30 to 6:30 where they can roll and buck, loosen up, graze and stretch. The rides – nice long quarter mile walks out to the track or to the fields to gallop. Back, they’re washed and rubbed off, cooled out. Fed at 11:00. At 3:30, some are grazed. Fed at 4:00. Checked over at 10:00 and fed carrots and a scoop of grain.\n\nWhat the Press Doesn’t Understand\n\nThis needs to be publicized! These newspaper reporters who’ve never settled a nervous horse by running their hands down his neck, never sat on a two-year-old in the starting gate, had the bell go off, and shot out of that gate faster than a rocket, who’ve never galloped full tilt into a four-foot timber fence alongside three other horses, never raised a foal from birth and brought that foal along until one day it was standing strong and victorious in a winner’s circle, these reporters who make grand negative generalizations, drawn from one highly publicized mishap, about how race horses are poorly treated, well, they need to tour Atlanta Hall Farm where Tom’s daughter Elizabeth, and son-in-law Gary Murray are now carrying on the tradition, sending horses with the Tom Voss imprint to the paddock. The young trainers need to see it, too. And what to do with the horses when they get older? The racing critics would have you believe the slaughterhouse truck immediately appears at the barn. Not so.\n\nOver his career, Tom didn’t just win races; he also turned hundreds of middle-aged flat horses who had lost their speed (flat races being about a mile), but were now more sensible and actually had more stamina, into top hurdle horses (hurdle races being about two miles), and sometimes when these hurdle horses lost a bit of their finishing zip, he turned them into timber horses (timber races being three to four miles), who, upon becoming teenagers, lived the good life of full-time foxhunters.\n\nWhen they got too old for this – out into the big field, “The Meadow,” as Tom called it, alluding to the painting, “The Elkridge Harford Hunt Crossing Atlanta Hall Meadow,” by Tom’s great uncle, Frank Voss, where the pensioners would gallop and run free for the rest of their lives, up into their late 20’s. Frank Voss finished this painting, with his brother Ned in the foreground, in 1942. Today, just out of the frame of the painting, is an old tree under which Cookie, a favorite hurdle horse Tom owned jointly with his godfather, Gary Winants, is buried. Gary’s ashes are also spread there. Art, racing, foxhunting, family history, environmental work (to prevent runoff, Tom and his brother Jack planted trees along the creek that leads into the meadow) all came together when Tom rode through The Meadow, or when he looked over this timeless and peaceful painting hanging in his living room.\n\nAtlanta Hall Farm\n\nTom turned it into one of the best training facilities in the country. That was an advantage, and that was a weight on his shoulders, too. For a few years, he had a farm manager. He graduated. Tom didn’t replace him. Then, he had the talented and devoted assistant trainer, Todd Wyatt. Todd graduated and Tom didn’t replace him.\n\nNo matter: in the middle of January, on a late afternoon before a blizzard was about to hit, there Tom would be, grease all over his hands, under a tractor, hooking up a plow. Early July, on a sultry Sunday afternoon, Tom would be up on another tractor, watering and harrowing the indoor track.\n\nOne year, part of the indoor collapses. Another year, a section of the outdoor track washes out. The barn needs a new roof. The fields need mowing. The alfalfa field has to be harvested. It was never ending. Owning your own training center has its plusses and its minuses. It was just too much sometimes! I used to tell him so. But then I’d remember the sign on his office desk, the office Mimi had designed and made for him in the old blacksmith’s shop, out away from everyone, which he never used. It said: “No crybabies.”\n\nAt The Track\n\nTom could treat every horse like a champion on Atlanta Hall Farm, but could he do it at the track? Yes. At Saratoga, he’d take sets out, as Europeans do, on relaxing hacks through Oklahoma, over to the racecourse, and around the paddock. Afternoons, he’d be back at the barn, grazing horses, turning them out in the paddocks. After dinner, at 10:00, he’d stop by the barn, offer each horse a carrot and a scoop of feed, give the horse a pat, talk to him, look him over, make sure everything was all right – the hay net was hung properly, the water bucket was full, the fan in front of the stall was set up just right, the horse was cool.\n\nThe flat tracks can learn something from steeplechasing – and from Tom. Trainers with a background in steeplechasing, Tom being a prime example, are well-rounded horsemen and make excellent flat trainers. Look at Hall of Famer Scotty Schulhoffer, trainer of Lemon Drop Kid. Who trained Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew? Billy Turner. My father Paddy and my Uncle Mikey both trained flat stakes winners. Jonathan Sheppard: the gambling man sees his name in the program at Saratoga, he rushes to the betting booth and puts down his money. Jimmy Murphy trained stakes winners for years in Maryland. Leo O’Brien is a top trainer in New York. All these trainers started off in steeplechasing.\n\nLoyalty\n\nThat is a trait of Tom’s that J.B. Secor stressed in his eulogy at St. James Church. Loyalty to his riders. J.B. spoke of Jean-Luc Samyn, a turf specialist who rode John’s Call. After winning the Sword Dancer Invitational at Saratoga in 2000, and then winning the Turf Classic Invitational Stakes at Belmont, Tom was approached by one jock’s agent after another, and urged by kibitzers, to switch to a Hall of Fame jockey for the Breeders Cup. He stayed with Jean-Luc and Jean-Luc rode him brilliantly that day, finishing third.\n\nBravery, Grace Under Pressure and Stoicism\n\nThese are traits Turney McKnight stressed in his eulogy, reading a military report on an ancestor of Tom’s who fought with distinction in the Civil War. By the time Tom reached his 60s, his body “hurt all over,” he told me, the only time I ever heard him allude to his ailments. Foot problems? Right foot would no longer fit in his riding boot? Simple, cut out a section and go hunting all day with four square inches of your foot exposed to the sleet and snow. Running horses at a point-to-point in Maryland, a sanctioned hunt meet in Tennessee, and a turf race at Belmont Park all on the same day in the spring? You’d better have inherited some military leadership genes in order to plan, coordinate, and order the movements of your troops. And on this day, what might be the most enjoyable moment? Holding granddaughter Genevieve in your arms and teaching her how to watch a race.\n\nFamily Life\n\nThe racetrack is not known for being conducive to a healthy family life. When Tom grew up, steeplechase outfits were on the move: stabled at Delaware Park late spring and June, Monmouth Park in July, Saratoga in August, Belmont in the fall. Trainers didn’t have a chance to watch their sons’ football games, their daughters’ soccer matches. Wives were separated from their husbands.\n\nTom chose to batten down the hatches at Atlanta Hall and to ship. This way, he often had to leave, but usually only for a day or two at a time. He’d be back on the farm with his wife Mimi as soon as possible, his son and daughter, his grandchildren, his mother, his friends, his owners all stopping by to see him. Tom is an unusual example of the horse racing life, of a training career – he lived in the exact center of his racing facility – leading to a fulfilling family life.\n\nTom’s daughter Elizabeth has been learning the art of foxhunting from her dad since she was a little girl, and has been steeped in Tom’s methods of training since she first galloped for him as a teenager. Elizabeth is married to Gary Murray who works both at the Voss stable and as a bloodstock agent. For decades, Mimi has been breeding her own string of horses and raising them on the farm, most of whom Tom sent to the winner’s circle.\n\nMaster of Foxhounds\n\nHe loved foxhunting, used it to train his timber horses and was devoted to carrying on the family tradition. His grandfather, E. S. “Ned” Voss, was Joint Master of the EHHC for 31 years, Tom for 21.\n\nHistory\n\nThe movie “Titanic”, based on A Night to Remember by Walter Lord, comes out. We watch the movie together, with our sons (his son my godson, my son his godson). Later, we meet Walter over lunch. Tom quietly, respectfully, asks questions about the Titantic, has his paperback copy signed by the renowned historian in his 80s, and asks about Walter’s book, The Fremantle Diary, A Journal of the Confederacy. A few years later, Tom’s son Sam galvanizes family members by researching the role of the Voss’s in the Civil War, visiting historic sites.\n\nLiterature\n\nThe night of my 40th birthday, Tom gives me a box of pencils, stands and recites a verse from Kipling’s “Gunga Din,” which ends, “You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din.” Last winter, he’s seated at the counter in our kitchen. I mention I’m teaching some Robert Frost. Tom takes a puff of his cigarette, a sip of his Coors Light, and recites, flawlessly, all four verses of “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.” A show stopper – the wives were impressed.\n\nGiving\n\nTom was generous. On a local level, where did Baltimore County trainers go in February when the ground was frozen? Oh Lord, Uncle Mikey would bring a van load of horses. J.B. would have a set. Others would arrive. And there we’d be on Tom’s horses – all in the indoor track. Close quarters! Fingers and feet frozen, we’d be galloping Tom’s horses one direction, and on the outside wall would be Mikey’s jogging. The big door would open and close. Gusts of frigid wind would burst in. Horses would skip and shy away from it into other horses. Around and around, with Tom by the door, watching every move.\n\nThree months later, March – here’s a van of horses needing to school over Tom’s hurdles. Four months later, the goings hard as a brick: where to go? Tom’s all-weather track.\n\nIn the same light, Tom supported the small point-to-points, sending young jumpers to them for experience and giving small meets a little prestige when his yellow van with the black horizontal stripe authoritatively rolled in and four perfectly turned out horses stepped down off the ramp. He worked night and day every spring to make the Elkridge-Harford Point-to-Point, held since the 1940s on Atlanta Hall, one of the best run meets in the country, with its winners going on to win the Maryland Hunt Cup.\n\nSaratoga & Pop’s Race\n\nThe Voss family loves Saratoga, and while there Tom fully supported steeplechasing, running at least one horse in every steeplechase race, winning a high percentage of them, and also winning flat races. Part of his afternoon routine was going to the backside, where he could be quiet and alone, and watch the flat races, analyzing the performances of horses he liked. At the end of the meet, he’d pick up a couple of good hurdle or turf prospects. Tom thrived in the heady atmosphere of the big time, riding the retired John’s Call through Horse Haven with his sets, trading jokes, stories and training tips with the best horsemen in the country.\n\nEvery summer, Tom and I would gear up to win the A. P. Smithwick Memorial, a Grade I $100,000 hurdle race held at Saratoga. We’d go through the whole experience together: he’d have me fully involved. I schooled and blew out Cookie before he won the A. P. Smithwick when it was held at Belmont in the early ’80s. I schooled and galloped Mickey Free, Brigade of Guards, and Anofferyoucan’t Refuse – all winners of the A. P Smithwick. We did it together. He knew I loved this. We were on a mission to win, as I call it, “Pop’s Race.” A few years, Tom didn’t have a horse that was a natural fit for the race. No matter, late spring he’d pick out one or two with the race in mind, train them for it, and when the time came, they finished in the money. That’s loyalty, giving, family, sportsmanship, friendship and incredible skill as a horseman all wrapped in one package. That’s Tom, and there’s so much more.\n\nRide On\n\nTom, you not only finished in the money, you finished the winner of a life well spent. You met every goal you set, and then, you didn’t relax – you raised the bar. We can all learn from the example you have given of a life lived with vigor, passion, forgiveness, and a great sense of humor.\n\nRide on, horseman and friend of a lifetime – ride on!\n\n©TheEquiery2014"
