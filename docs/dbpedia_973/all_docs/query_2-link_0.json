What you encounter on our website, we hope will draw you and your family to our Spiritual Home located at 147 Main Street, Johnson City, New York. This holy ground with ministries routed in our deep catholic heritage will invite you into a deeper communion with God, with yourself and your neighbors – your fellow worshipers. We appreciate with gratitude your presence and sharing the faith with us.\n\nSacraments\n\nThe Catholic Church is the mystical Body of Christ. As the Body\n\nof Christ, it is made up of both Word and Sacrament.\n\nIn the Sacrament of Confirmation, the baptized person is “sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit” and is strengthened for service to the Body of Christ."
