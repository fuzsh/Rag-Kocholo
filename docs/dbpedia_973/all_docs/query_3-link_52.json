        "text": "The marriage vows are spoken before God and in front of your family and friends. Along with the vows, you will make ‘Declarations’, which confirm that you will always love and care for each other in a way that will please God.\n\nThe lifetime commitment of these promises and statements are represented when you give the rings to each other, as a symbol of unending love. This completes the marriage, meaning you can now sign the official marriage paperwork at that point in the service.\n\nWhen the vows are said, you turn to each other, take each other’s right hand and say:\n\n‘I, (name), take you, (name)\n\nto be my wife/husband,\n\nto have and to hold\n\nfrom this day forward;\n\nfor better, for worse,\n\nfor richer, for poorer,\n\nin sickness and in health,\n\nto love and to cherish,\n\ntill death us do part,\n\naccording to God’s holy law.\n\nIn the presence of God I make this vow.’\n\nFrom The Marriage Service, Common Worship\n\nThese vows are unique to church weddings. By making these promises in church, you invite a loving and profoundly caring God to help you keep them.\n\nYour Vicar may offer sessions at the church, the vicarage, or sometimes another venue to help you prepare for the day. This is a good chance to think about your vows and the difference they will make.\n\nYou can see your own names added in to the wedding service if you use our Ceremony Planner, which will also build in your preferences for hymns and readings.\n\nCan we write our own vows?\n\nThe official vows cover all those things we hope for from a good marriage and are legally binding, so they can not be changed. However, there may be some special, additional things you and your partner want to say to each other in this setting.\n\nSome couples have done this by writing something as an additional reading, or using poetry or an extract from a book to say those things in a personal way. The vicar can advise you on how your ideas could work well as part of the service."
