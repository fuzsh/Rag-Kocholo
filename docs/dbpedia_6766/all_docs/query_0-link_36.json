And yet, it seems that we’re all regarding it as one big joke, with many memes resulting from various campaign rallies and presidential debates.\n\nA Very Short History of Contested Presidential Elections\n\nby John Colie\n\nEditor’s note: Historical information from this article comes from two main sources: “Our Most Vulnerable Election” by Pamala Karlan, published in the New York Review of Books, and The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents by William A. DeGregorio. By the time this article is published, we might have a slightly better idea of how this year’s presidential election might turn out.\n\nWhat I’m Watching to Take My Mind Off This Election\n\nBy Harry Ducrepin\n\nThe presidential election is coming up in a few days and thinking about the consequences of America’s choice next Tuesday is both devastating and overwhelming.

America has never been so divided, and with the upcoming election, all of this country’s divisiveness will come to a head.\n\nZoom: Educational Boon or Learning Doom?\n\nby Dylan McIntyre\n\nOnline education is a pretty polarizing topic nowadays. Most of us are experiencing it firsthand, and after several months of using Zoom, chances are you either love its flexibility and leniency (how else would I get to attend lectures in pajamas?) or you just want to throw your stupid laptop out the window because your background image has been permanently burned into your retinas.\n\nGood Riddance, College Board\n\nby Isabelle Pappas\n\nThe class of 2025 will be applying to college in the midst of a global pandemic, and Cornell has chosen to relieve the single most stressful aspect of the college application process: standardized testing. The Sun reported back in April that Cornell would be the first Ivy League institution to waive the standardized testing requirement for both early and regular decision applicants in this year’s admission’s cycle.\n\nCombating College Loneliness\n\nby Dylan McIntyre\n\nLet’s face it: making friends at college is hard.

When we talk about problems in the system, the same ideas pop up, notably the privatization of prisons, mass incarceration and lack of rehabilitation programs. While it’s great that we have acknowledged these issues, we should start to think beyond the scope of them and get a little more radical.\n\nA Few Netflix Recommendations to Restore Lost Intelligence Before the Semester Begins\n\nby Katriana Galloway\n\nYou’re rotting.

Everybody else has to hyphenate.” In a riveting dialogue on the implications of the African-American identity, she begs her readers to question what it means to be hyphenated, how it feels to be considered American by law but a second-class category of citizens by practice.\n\nCORNELLA | What Your Favorite TV Shows Would Look Like Today\n\nStars: They’re just like us! There’s something comforting in knowing that I’m not the only one who has to stay home and at a six feet distance.\n\nVeritas Forum Announces 2020 #My2020CommencementSpeech Contest\n\nby Zachary Lee\n\nWith commencements and graduations nationwide either being cancelled or going virtual, the Veritas Forum is ensuring that before the year ends, members of the Class of 2020 still get to share their stories.

We might be stuck at home, but we need not succumb to boredom.\n\nGALLOWAY | Corona Season: Exposing Cornell’s Simpler-Minded\n\nHardly a couple weeks ago, while still a student in the traditional sense, I observed the bespeckling of our once-tangible institution by a scattered but substantial population of a particular type of student. For the sake of your efficient recollection, I’ll attempt to compile them all into a cast of two characters (they aren’t a terribly varied crowd).\n\nPaying absolutely no attention in an econ discussion section is student number one, daydreaming about enlisting in the active troops of America’s dumbest youth currently deployed on Miami beaches.\n\nCORNELLA | Attention Lazy People\n\n[Content warning: this article contains discussion of body image. Reader discretion is advised]\n\nI was shocked when I got home and realized I had gained 15 pounds.\n\nGALLOWAY | Golden Goose Shoes: We Get it, You’re Rich\n\nDon’t have a Goodwill near you? Can’t afford to independently wear down some white sneakers via walking in them, as one does?\n\nCORNELLA | You Don’t Seriously Watch The Bachelor, Right?\n\nAnyone who publicly professes their love for the hit series The Bachelor is bound to be immediately met with rolling eyes, judgmental smirks, and questions that sound like, “You don’t seriously watch The Bachelor right?”\n\nYes, yes I do. And proudly, as well.\n\nSPOTLIGHT | Not All Business: Alumna Sonya Chyu ‘18 Combines Commerce, Chimes and Creative Writing\n\nIn a world of increasing specialization, students of the University often feel pressured to narrow their paths of study. Business major, English minor and chimesmaster Sonya Chyu ‘18 was a joyful exception to this rule.\n\nROVINE | It’s Aquarius Season, Freaks!!\n\nIt’s the most eccentric, trailblazing and radical time of the year! Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet of freedom, originality, rebellion and revolution.\n\nMy Journey in Information Science, Systems and Technology: A Filipino-American Woman’s Perspective\n\nI am holding a paper sign that says, “Because over 90% of LGBTQ tech employees surveyed reported experiencing harassment, mistreatment, or discrimination at work,” inside the intersection of Duffield Hall, where Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC) took a picture for their Fall 2019 Diversity Photo Campaign, #ILookLikeAnEngineer. Discovering my passion in Computer Science & Information Science\n\nIn Fall 2017, I took CS 1110 with Professor Walker White and became more interested in CS.\n\nCORNELLA | How to Properly Watch TV in 2020\n\nBy the time December 26th rolls around, Instagram was suddenly flooded with memes revolved around the new year: Confessions of how awful 2019 was. Proclamations that 2020 will be the year.\n\nROVINE | Capricorn Season\n\nDecember 22-January 20\n\nIt’s Capricorn Season! That’s code for: time to get your sh*t together!\n\nBIRD & human | 2\n\nWill prepares a birdseed taco for a ruminative Bird.\n\nLOVE & SQUALOR | 5 Must-See Pieces at the Johnson This Semester\n\nFounded in 1973 in memory of benefactor and Cornell Trustee Herbert F. Johnson (Class of 1922), the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art is home to over 35,000 permanent works of art. Its diverse collections span six millennia and a wide spectrum of cultural origins.\n\nROVINE | Festive, Fun, and Fruitful: Manifest Expansion This Sagittarius SZN\n\nNovember 22 – December 21\n\nHow did Scorpio season treat you?

It’s about halfway through the semester at this point, and everyone’s favorite time of year: flu, prelim, and snow season.\n\nHEALTHNUT | Guide To Cornell’s Fitness Classes\n\nWhat many people don’t know is that having access to Cornell’s fitness centers also means having access to an array of group fitness classes – not just taught by elderly and overweight ex-PE teachers, but also your overly enthusiastic but super strong peers. Luckily, these classes span gyms across campus and boast tons of time slots – perfect for your 7 am Yoga or 7 pm HIIT.\n\nBIRD & human | 1\n\n[This is the first installation of the comic series BIRD & human. Enjoy.]\n\nIn an effort to escape running into a recent ex, Bird takes a detour across campus.\n\nCORNELLA | My Big Fat Jewish Memorial\n\nAnyone who has binge-watched Modern Family, Full House, or any other family based sit-com can admit to laughing loudly at situations, while simultaneously smirking and thinking “this would never actually happen…”\n\nI’ll admit, I once believed this too. The events in those shows seem too scripted to ever actually happen.\n\nWITH LOVE & SQUALOR | Zac Posen Shutters His Business: What Does This Mean For The Fashion And Retail Industry?\n\nWe all remember the moment at the 2016 Met Gala when the lights dimmed, red carpet chatter silenced into hushed gasps, and heads turned to see Claire Danes step out in a ball gown that shined brighter than the explosion of camera flashes that quickly ensued. The whimsical piece constructed out of sheer organza and fiber optics was the fashion moment of the year — the LED gown fused other-wordly glamour with contemporary polish, a timeless silhouette with cutting-edge technology, and could only have been a creation of the legendary Zac Posen. I was immediately infatuated with his ceaseless passion for experimentation and\n\ninnovation — each custom gown jaw-dropping in a new way — paired with his unwavering vision as an artist, each piece unmistakably his.\n\nThe Best “Due Friday” Memes: A Curated Anthology\n\nIn case you live under a rock, or, like some mysteriously sane person, don’t check social media, you might have missed the “Due Friday” memes that went around last week. What a wonderful way for students across the entire university to come together and do what we do best: 1) roast the f*ck out of each other and 2) poke fun at how busy, stressed, and depressed we all are. See below for my top picks from the notorious “Any Person, Any Meme” Facebook group…\n\n17.\n\nBOO! How to Survive⁠—and Thrive⁠—During Scorpio Season\n\nHappy Halloween and Happy Spooky SZN! It’s no coincidence that Halloween (and every U.S. presidential election) falls when the sun is in Scorpio, the most mysterious, scary, and downright frightening of all 12 Zodiac signs.\n\nMILLS | Haha, I’m Sad\n\nThere’s something about throwing up a janky peace sign to yourself in a greasy mirror post-weekly Wednesday night sobbing session (no, not the one you had scheduled in your G-Cal that should have ended forty-five minutes ago, the one that came after you hit that point in the night where you realized it was an all-nighter kinda night) that gives you the strength to wash off your runny mascara that you paid an extra ten dollars for and wipe off the remnants of the half a gallon of chocolate milk you impulsively bought at Jansen’s twenty minutes ago (even though you’re lactose intolerant and wanted to go Vegan three days ago) and walk back into the Cocktail Lounge. I know what you’re thinking, “wow, Sara, that’s like really messy, maybe you should see someone” or “maybe just stop buying the chocolate milk?”, but I sweaarrr it’s totally not about me, and if it was, I’m only sometimes lactose intolerant.\n\nCORNELLA | How Friends can Teach you Everything you Need to Know\n\nWe all get a warm feeling when we see the Friends cast laugh together as “I’ll be there for you” plays in the background… because they really will always be there for us. No matter how lonely or bad we’re feeling, we can always count on the Central Perk squad from the world’s most popular sitcom to cheer us up…\n\nI certainly counted on Friends being just a couple of clicks away my entire first week at Cornell, since I was homesick and everything outside of the four walls of Bauer Hall seemed scary.\n\nWITH LOVE & SQUALOR | The 6 Train\n\nLast spring, I took the 6 train from the periphery of Spanish Harlem to my office in Soho every day. I remember the way I’d limp up the hill at the cross section of 110th Street, peering into the backlit shadow of the subway stop at the end of the street, blasting Bowie classics to cancel out the whisper of catcalls around me.\n\nXYLYLS | The Privilege of Loss\n\nI try to catalogue everything that happens, maybe to the brink of obsession. To that point, I have three pillars on which I rely to retell what is effectively my story: my Google calendar, a five-year Hobonichi, and my bullet journal.\n\nROVINE | The Democratic Candidates As The Zodiac\n\nGiven there are exactly 12 candidates vying for the Democratic nomination at tonight’s debate, I figured I had to highlight them all as represented by the 12 Zodiac signs. (Admittedly, I know way more about astrology than I do about politics- don’t come after me!)\n\nElizabeth Warren: Aries\n\nKnown to “swat and jab at the air” in interviews, Warren can seem a bit Aries Aggressive indeed.\n\nCartoon Caption Contest | Week of October 13\n\nMeet us halfway and submit a caption for this week’s cartoon!

I mean, take the infamous “I am worried” email sent to a professor and multiply the awkwardness by twenty to get something near the level of cringe of my situation.\n\nROVINE | Libra Season: Time to Find Balance, Beauty, and Love\n\nEvery September 23rd, we say farewell to Virgo season.

In my opinion, astrology has fascinating implications that may guide us toward manifesting our greatest, fullest, and highest selves in the sacred time we have on this Earth.\n\nDESTROYING JOTENHEIM | The Three Essentials of Orientation Week\n\nPack your schedule to the max\n\nOne of the great things about Cornell is that they are well aware of the difficult transition between high school and summer to living at college, and they go through a lot of effort to make the change as easy as possible for incoming freshmen with Orientation Week. Events start as early as the day of move-in, and if you take full advantage of the university’s scheduled activities, you shouldn’t have a single minute of empty time to stew over the discomfort of being in an entirely new and unfamiliar place.\n\nSUNSPOTS | Ask Us Anything – Orientation 2019\n\nWe get it! You probably have a lot of questions.\n\nRUMINATIONS | Thanks CU, Next?\n\nFor a period of time in my childhood, I thought Cornell was the only college. I didn’t understand the concept of a University, but I had also been conditioned well.\n\nCULTURALLY SHOOK | On graduating and confronting a future\n\nWriting about endings tends towards the cliché. I want to preface this by saying that it’s impossible for me to write about graduation without feeling uncomfortably self-aware of the redundancy of my feelings.\n\nTEA TIME WITH JULIAN | A slope day recovery playlist in 9 acts\n\nSongs for May 9\n\nAct 1: Father John Misty – “Nancy From Now On”\n\nNothing says ‘How did I end up asleep on my friend’s porch?’ quite like a Father John Misty song.\n\nAct 2: The Fray – “How to Save a Life”\n\nWalk home.\n\nCARTOON CAPTION CONTEST | Week of May 5\n\nThanks for a great year of great captions! Feel free to submit a caption for the first paper of next semester.\n\nEAT SLEEP REPEAT | The Best Places On Campus to Fuel Your Ice Addiction\n\nConfession time: I am that annoying girl in your math lecture that obnoxiously munches on ice the entire time. But honestly, how could I not?\n\nDESTROYING JOTENHEIM | “Left” Behind\n\nHave you ever had to sit segregated from your group of friends in lecture? Have you ever had to walk into a classroom and step over countless feet on your way to the most inaccessible corner of the room?\n\nAKABAS | The Top 50 Players in the NBA: #7-1\n\nIn case you missed Part 1 and Part 2 of this series, you can scan through my complete, updated Top 50 list for a quick refresher. This final group of players was so hard to rank that, after losing nights of sleep over it, my dad suggested that I go back to my original criteria for ranking players: “If you dropped this player onto any NBA team at random, by how much would they improve that team’s odds of winning the title?” I set up a spreadsheet with each of the remaining players as the columns and all the playoff teams as the rows, and I tried to estimate (as best I could) the increase in championship odds if each player were to be magically placed onto each team’s roster.\n\nCARTOON CAPTION CONTEST | Week of April 21\n\nMeet us halfway and submit a caption for this week’s cartoon! The Sun staff will vote and the winning caption — along with the winner’s name — will appear in the Monday, April 29 edition of the paper.\n\nSKATCH | FOMO is REAL\n\nI am here to send out a PSA to all those suffering from FOMO and all those suffering because of the people who suffer from FOMO. For those of you who do not know, FOMO stands for “Fear Of Missing Out.” A common occurrence in many friend groups, one of the most frequent cases is when someone suddenly finds out they were not invited to an event that their friends went to together, either through social media or word of mouth.\n\nCARTOON CAPTION CONTEST | Week of April 14\n\nMeet us halfway and submit a caption for this week’s cartoon! The Sun staff will vote and the winning caption — along with the winner’s name — will appear in the Monday, April 22 edition of the paper.\n\nPlease Please Please Stop Eating At Chick-Fil-A\n\nBy now, we’ve all learned that almost anything can be political. As public discourse is integrated into industry and culture, it’s almost unusual for a company to lack a hot political take or sympathetic philanthropic cause.\n\nAsk Anj | Freshman Friendships\n\nQ: So it’s going to be the end of the semester soon, and I have a problem: I’m a freshman, and I feel like I don’t have strong, sustainable friendships. My roommates are nice, but I don’t see us hanging out much after this year, and I’ve got some platonic friends from my FWS, but once that’s over, I have no idea if we’ll still talk to each other.\n\nCARTOON CAPTION CONTEST | Week of April 7\n\nMeet us halfway and submit a caption for this week’s cartoon!

The Sun staff will vote and the winning caption — along with the winner’s name — will appear in the Monday, April 8 edition of the paper.\n\nHEALTHNUT | Rise of Heart Attacks in Young Women\n\nFelicite Tomlinson, sister of former One Direction member Louis Tomlinson, died suddenly on March 13th at only 18 years old from a suspected heart attack – a reality being “increasingly recognized in young women”, according to Professor Simon Redwood, a consultant cardiologist at London Bridge Hospital. And Felicite isn’t the only one.\n\nDestroying Jotenheim | Reintroducing Excitement Into Your Life At Cornell\n\nA close friend of mine once told me to seek discomfort. Actually, that’s not true at all.\n\nAKABAS | The 10 Commandments of Awkwardly Running Into People on Campus\n\nYou’re walking straight down College Ave. and find that someone else is walking straight at you.\n\nDIVING IN | Strong Suit — An Analysis Of Superheroes And Their Suits\n\nThe night Captain Marvel was released, my friends and I drove to the Ithaca Mall movie theater in a car, brimming with anticipation. Though I don’t consider myself a die-hard Marvel fan, I was particularly excited to see this film—the CGI effects and female-driven storyline captivated my attention.\n\nSKATCH | 10 Steps to Take When Cornell Is Throwing Grenades at Your Mental Health\n\nHere I hand to you a figurative racket to bat back those mental health grenades. Everything is going to be fine.\n\nTRUTHBETOLD | The Rise of Bangtan\n\nThey won two Billboard Music Awards, performed at the American Music Awards with their hit song DNA, and recently attended the 61st Grammy Awards to present the award for Best R&B album to artist, H.E.R. Surely you must have heard of them. BTS, also known as Bulletproof Boy Scouts when they first arrived on the Kpop scene, is one of the most famous boy groups to attract international audiences.\n\nON MY MIND | What Immigrants Can Learn About Anti-Communism From the Civil Rights Movement\n\n“The American dream has become something much more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and international levels.” — James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time\n\n***\n\nOn page 12 of the standard N-400 Application for Naturalization, all foreign-born persons seeking U.S. citizenship are asked, “Have you EVER been a member of, or in any way associated (either directly or indirectly) with the Communist Party?” It is a yes or no question. Why is it there to begin with?\n\nHEALTHNUT | Celery Juice is a Joke\n\nScrew quinoa, berries and especially whole vegetables. The newest health trend: celery juice.\n\nTEA TIME WITH JULIAN | A Meditation On Martha\n\nOver the course of the past couple weeks, the BDS (Boycott, Divest, and Sanction) movement has been a particularly hot topic on campus. From initial communications between SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine) and Martha Pollack to an uneasy session of the Student Assembly, the issue has taken center stage for many campus organizers and members of student government.\n\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM | More Than A Month: Black History Being Made\n\nBlack History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by black people and their role in history. Since 1976, February has been designated Black History Month, not only in the USA, but in countries around the world- including Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nCARTOON CAPTION CONTEST | Week of March 4\n\nMeet us halfway and submit a caption for this week’s cartoon!

Many years after I reenacted every single dunk contest dunk on my NERF hoop, something about the event continues to enthrall me, so I’m handing out awards for the bests and worsts in dunk contest history.\n\nCORNELL CROSSWORD | FEBRUARY 14 (PUZZLE AND ANSWER)\n\nNew, original crosswords will appear monthly.\n\nSolutions:\n\nCARTOON CAPTION CONTEST | Week of February 11\n\nMeet us halfway and submit a caption for this week’s cartoon!

Additionally, after flubbing some players’ rankings in Part 1, I’ve decided to keep my Top 50 in a Google Doc, so that I can both correct my previous mistakes and continue to update the list throughout the season.\n\nAKABAS | The Top 50 Players in the NBA: Part 1\n\nWe know how to rank teams: my team beats your team, therefore my team is better. Just rooting for our teams carries an old-school sense of hometown pride and loyalty, but ranking players is overwhelmingly more interesting and fun — it’s a combination of statistics and intuition, of situational evidence and conjecture.\n\nSKATCH | My Disadvantages Are My Privilege\n\nDisclaimer: I formally recognize economic, racial, knowledge, gender, and every other sort of privilege as ongoing problems that we should all strive to become more cognizant of, as they have and continue to create inequality that provides for unjust pain and suffering.

Anna Akana is a Youtuber, life guru, and mental health advocate who creates videos about relatable and relevant topics, as well as longer narrative films. In this particular video, she discusses how impossible it feels to be happy when it seems as if your whole world is on fire — a sentiment that many Cornellians share on a weekly basis.\n\nEAT SLEEP REPEAT | “It’s Called Self Care” — Why the Mantra Is Ruining My Life\n\nIn the past week I have napped an average of two hours per day, impulsively bought three sweaters that I cannot afford, practically inhaled Twizzlers and an entire sleeve of Oreos, and watched five of the raunchiest past episodes of The Bachelor, all while telling myself, “It’s called self care.”\n\nHindsight is 20/20 of course, and looking back I think my actions were probably the complete opposite of self care. In the moment, however, I was so encapsulated in my stress from prelim season that I allowed myself to do practically anything just because I have this extremely vague mantra to “affirm” my desires.\n\nRuminations | Eating Is An Election\n\n‘Tis the season of campaign ads, mudslinging, robocalls, selfies of people with their “I Voted” stickers, and all of those other wonderful things that go along with election season.

Most times it’s within reason—after doing something immoral, unethical, or unkind, it’s a necessary part of self-regulation that, without intention, keeps our emotions in check and subsequently provides a feedback mechanism for changing or continuing a behavior.

Yet these rising disciplines are gaining ground at such a fast pace that many scientists and physicians have begun to neglect an important aspect of translational research: the native and marginalized populations around the globe that are heavily involved in the medical research, yet rarely reap its benefits.\n\nCARTOON CAPTION CONTEST | Week of September 17\n\nMeet us halfway and submit a caption for this week’s cartoon!

The anniversary underscored what has been an exciting, albeit precarious period of swift developments in the triangulated relations between the governments of North Korea, South Korea, and the United States in recent months.\n\nAKABAS | Stop Complaining About A Perfectly Good NBA Finals Matchup\n\nSince when did NBA fans become so spoiled?

The ratio of neural/motor energy devoted to jotting down whatever convoluted statements followed the words, “This is important,” from one of professors’ mouths (it’s one of those rare two-professor courses) versus scrolling through Facebook and answering emails had gradually shifted in disproportionate favor of the latter.\n\nSOUND OFF | Music on the Mind\n\nPeople generally agree that music has an impact on mental health and our moods, whether through numerous studies that show correlations between music, relaxation and improved mental health, or through countless Twitter memes about sad Drake songs.

Between Drake’s new singles, Migos new album and so many more new projects coming out, there’s a lot to digest and review.\n\nTHE RADICAL CENTER | The Big Tech Bust-Up\n\nAmerica’s tech titans are stifling competition, skirting regulators and harming democracy. Time to break them up.\n\nOUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM | The Legacy of the Tet Offensive\n\nIt is difficult to grapple with our complex understanding of the past. Sometimes we remember an event.\n\nOF MARGINAL INTEREST | On the Shot\n\nAh, syllabus week. The time to lounge around with friends, partake in that Tuesday karaoke night at Loco, embark on that spontaneous trip to Niagara Falls with your friends—these are the good days.\n\nKYLIE’S ROOM | Atlanta Monster, A Podcast In A League Of Its Own\n\nToo often, true crime podcasts fetishize or take light of heinous human actions. I’ll admit, I’ve listened to many – and have even written about them.\n\nTRAVELIN’ WITH JACQUELINE | From “WHOA” to “NO”: My Youtube History\n\nLike any sleep-deprived college student earning a degree in Procrastination, I often convince myself I need a study break, only to find myself panicking two hours later because I spent too much time (1) reading about the endless antics of well-dressed but not-so-well-behaved Lapo Elkann (decadent heir to the Fiat fortune), (2) browsing the sale sections of online clothing retailers that shall remain unnamed (for the safety of your wallet) or (3) poring over the exceptional articles written by the Blogs section. However, as of late, I’ve noticed that I’ve been reining in those study breaks pretty well, so that the most they’ve gone on for is maybe half an hour.\n\nBIWEEKLY JOKES FOR EVERYDAY FOLKS | Super Bowl Special: Biweekly Jokes for Everyday Blokes\n\nFirst of all, why the bloody hell is this game called football if the least talented player is the kicker? But before I get too miffed, I’d like to tell you all about how this year’s American Football Championship Match will “go down” as you Americans say it.\n\nThe Elephant in the Room | How to Survive On A Budget While Studying Abroad or Off-Campus\n\nA lot of students choose the spring semester to study abroad or take advantage of off-campus opportunities such as Cornell in Washington. As an international student, I’ve essentially been “studying abroad” since freshman year but this spring I decided to take a break from the Ithaca cold while also getting work experience and Cornell credits by participating in the Cornell in Washington Program.\n\nGRACE’S GROVE | Muji: The No-Brand Brand\n\nSince my first purchase of MUJI pens back in 2013, I’ve personally witnessed an exponential increase in the number of people carrying around the signature MUJI clear-bodied gel pens in class. While many of you probably have also been introduced to this brand’s signature stationery, there is actually a lot more to MUJI than meets the eye.\n\nTHE RADICAL CENTER | The Year Gone By\n\nThis past year offered gloom and uncertainty—and inspiration. A brief, hopeful retrospective on 2017.\n\nAN EDUCATION | On Being Lost in the Murky Twilight Zone of Finals Week\n\nWe’re in that strange twilight zone between the end of classes and going home: is it finals week or is it the end of all things looming? I couldn’t tell you how the time has been passing; all I know is that I wake up, work-work-work (or try, at least), forget to eat, get too tired to continue working, and go to bed at strange hours, the only constant in my life being the fact that I’m perpetually falling behind the rigorous study schedule I devised for myself in a last-ditch attempt to #savemysemester.\n\nTHE E’ER INSCRUTABLE | Alpha and Omega: The Light in the Abyss\n\nStanding beneath McGraw Tower at midnight is akin to experiencing the prolonged death throes of an eternity. Every day becomes as the instar of all time en miniature.\n\nGRACE’S GROVE | Boujee Freshmen Take on NYC\n\nI hope everyone had an amazing Thanksgiving Break! Like 80% of Cornell’s freshman population, I headed over to New York City for a nice and homey friendsgiving.\n\nCOFFEE THOUGHTS | First Semester Residues\n\nAs we embark upon the homestretch of this semester, I often find myself spacing out over my usual Temple of Zeus iced mocha. Weirdly enough, I hadn’t even noticed how frequent my coffee consumption was until a friend from home pointed it out via cross-country Facetime—every time we talked, I seemed to have a convenient cup of coffee within hand’s reach.\n\nSOUND OFF | The Pros and Cons of Tidal (And Other Pay-to-Stream Services)\n\nIn 2015, Jay-Z purchased Tidal for a cool 56 million dollars, touting it as a streaming platform “controlled by the artists”. Now, his Tidal holdings have boosted his net worth to make him the 2nd richest hip hop artist in the world, right behind Sean Combs and surpassing Dr. Dre.\n\nTHE RADICAL CENTER | The #MeToo Moral Panic\n\nThe push to expose sexual assault could give way to a long-awaited reckoning with America’s sexist rot. But if #MeToo becomes a mania, it might not.\n\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM | 21 Years Living Under a Dictatorship\n\nOn November 15, the military took over my country’s main broadcasting station, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Cooperation, and announced that it had put our president of 37 long years under house arrest. A week later on the 21st, President Mugabe turned in his resignation letter just as the impeachment process in Parliament began.\n\nOF MARGINAL INTEREST | A Losing Game: The Economics of Women’s Sports\n\nWomen’s sports across the country are stuck in an vicious cycle, and an example of this cycle can be found right here on campus.\n\nEMEM ELEMENT | Why Twitter Is Gold\n\nThere is no question that, at an increasingly fast rate, technology and media have advanced significantly. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Internet, iMessage, text messaging, and other various forms of communication can now all reside on a single smartphone.\n\nTRAVELIN’ WITH JACQUELINE | Say Hello to My Little Friend (Confessions of a Pin Collector)\n\nI’m not sure when I got my first pin, but the earliest documented proof I could find of me wearing a pin is from May 14, 2000. In the picture, my parents are conducting a mini-photoshoot at home with my older sister and two-year-old self, and you can see a tiny pair of red sunglasses pinned to the top of my pink cardigan:\n\nTo this day, I still have and frequently wear that red sunglasses pin, but it’s fair to say that my pin collection has since expanded.\n\nTHE RADICAL CENTER | The Perils of Speculation\n\nRobert Mueller has investigated Russian meddling with diligence and professionalism. Firing him would be disastrous.\n\nFOOD WEEK | Flowchart: Which Cornell Eatery Should You Go To?\n\nCan’t decide where to eat today? We’ve got you covered.\n\nCULTURALLY SHOOK | I Don’t Feel White\n\nI glare at myself in the mirror. Maybe if I stare at my reflection long enough, critically enough, I’ll finally see myself the way the U.S. government sees me: white.\n\nFOOD WEEK | What is the Best Food Item at Cornell?\n\nNoah Harrelson ‘21: Risley’s overnight oats, that sweet nectar of Gods. As I eat, the world stops.\n\nFOOD WEEK | On James Harden, and Why Cereal Isn’t a Breakfast Food\n\nIn late September 2016, Houston Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni announced that his star player, James Harden, would be switching positions to play point guard. This seemed like a peculiar decision at first.\n\nKYLIE’S ROOM | Strange Fruit: The Media’s Double Standard When It Comes to Black Women\n\nAs I get older and wiser (all 21 years and six months), I’ve come to realize that although I am an American, America (or my country) was not made for me. This land of the free was made on the backs of my ancestors who did not enjoy such freedoms. Having grown up in mostly white environments and choosing to attend a predominantly white university, I’ve become accustomed to being the only black girl in the room.\n\nFOOD WEEK | 5 Foods to Maintain Healthy Skin\n\nAs the weather gets colder and the wind shows its wrath more and more, it becomes really difficult to walk around campus every day. It can also be especially cumbersome during these chilly times to keep our skin smooth and soft.\n\nFOOD WEEK | The Big Red Buck: What is it Good For?\n\n3:00 A.M. is high time for a deflated, depressed-looking bag of Cheetos. My mind steers me like a sleepwalker down a flight of stairs and into the bowels of my dorm.\n\nFOOD WEEK | Ithaca’s Secret Menus\n\nWhile Cornell is known for its superb dining hall food, Ithaca has many of its own culinary gems, one of which is Louie’s Lunch Truck. A favorite among Cornellians, Louie’s is that place you go to when you’ve got those late night or post-partying greasy food cravings.\n\nFOOD WEEK | Understanding How Surroundings Shape Eating Habits\n\nDeciding what, when, and where to eat may seem like a simple task at first. But when our schedule becomes busy with clubs & classes, overwhelmed by personal circumstances, or just unorganized in general, proper and balanced eating habits can often take a backseat.\n\nFOOD WEEK | A Closer Look at Mexico’s “Green Gold”\n\nWhile I will never understand 90% of the logic behind the store layout of Ithaca’s Wegmans (e.g. why the dried noodles must appear in seven separate aisles), I will admit that the Wegmanites got one thing right: the strategic placement of the avocado bags. Their perpetual position in a giant wooden crate by the entrance has permitted me to develop somewhat of an avocado dependency in recent years.\n\nFOOD WEEK | Fall Flavors\n\nI thought of some really simple, fun recipes that everyone should try this fall season! To kick things off, I’ll start with two takes on a seasonal favorite: the pumpkin spice latté.\n\nFOOD WEEK | If Cornell Majors Were Halloween Candies\n\nEngineering = Warheads\n\nFor some reason, Mech-E’s and Chem-E’s think they’re at war with every other major at Cornell, and won’t go more than two minutes without reminding you that they’re engineers and that your major is inferior. They treat every project or interview like it’s a life-or-death situation and you think they might explode at any given moment.\n\nTHE RADICAL CENTER | In Search of a New Politics\n\nTribal politics have paralyzed America. Amid our division, radical centrism offers hope of renewal.\n\nSOUND OFF | Cardi B vs. The World\n\nThis year, Cardi B exploded onto the rap scene with “Bodak Yellow” after remaining relatively unknown, though she did have a large Instagram following and became a regular cast member on a reality TV show, Love & Hip Hop, New York, in 2015. Due to “Bodak Yellow”’s success, Cardi B became the first female rapper to, unassisted, hit Number 1 on the Billboard charts (other female rappers only reached Number 1 with features on their songs).\n\nGRACE’S GROVE | Korean Beauty Products Review — Face Mask Edition\n\nWelcome back to my list of cool, creative, and borderline exotic beauty products! I’m going to be giving reviews on some popular face masks in this article.\n\nAN EDUCATION | Missing Connections: My Love Affair with Tinder\n\nI have something to confess: I love Tinder. And, disclaimer (because it’s necessary): I’m not hooking up with anyone on it.\n\nOUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM | The Time to Support Cornell’s Graduate Students Is Now\n\nLast spring’s union election campaign may have ended with a disappointing result for the collective rights of Cornell’s graduate students, but Cornell Graduate Students United (CGSU) has continued to fight. In the past weeks, members of CGSU have been asking fellow graduate students at Cornell to vote about the future of their organizing strategy and the possibility of another election attempt.\n\nBIWEEKLY JOKES FOR EVERYDAY FOLKS | Dialogue\n\nI went to my friend’s event Tuesday night, a Hillel event, titled “A Funny Thing Happened On My Way to the Middle East,” in which Joel Chasnoff spoke about his life story, and in particular, his relationship to Israel. What started as a stand up bit—typical in its delivery, ingenuity, and laugh-generating ability but atypical in its Jewish-oriented humor—turned into a serious opportunity to discuss Israel in a safe space among mostly Jewish students.\n\nCOFFEE THOUGHTS | When I Look, Eye Brows\n\nUpon a cursory brows—ha, pun intended—everything can seem so easy. That is, until you’ve actually been through the process yourself.\n\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM | A Guide to 7 Black Beauty Products and Where to Find Them\n\nFor international students, moving to a new country with a different language and culture takes a big adjustment and relearning of social cues. One of the biggest worries as a black international student is whether or not you will find beauty products that cater to your hair texture and that understand your skin.\n\nTRAVELIN’ WITH JACQUELINE | My Travel Bucket List\n\nThus far in my twenty-year tenure on this planet, I’ve traveled to quite a few places–within the United States, I’ve been to Portland (Oregon), Reno, Yosemite, Las Vegas, Niagara Falls, New York City, Boston, and Atlanta. Internationally, I’ve been to France, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Taiwan.\n\nAN APPLE A DAY | Pumpkin Spice and Everything Nice: The Benefits of Incorporating Pumpkins into Your Diet\n\nWith the chilly weather and colorful leaves rolling into the Ithaca area, there’s no doubt that fall season is upon us. And with the fall weather and ambiance comes the obvious pumpkin obsession: pumpkin muffins, pumpkin pies (who could forget Patty’s delicious pumpkin pies?), and, of course, pumpkin spice lattes.\n\nWELCOME TO THE ZOO | The 2nd Amendment\n\nWith an open mind and two sides of the story, you’re bound to learn something new. Welcome to the zoo!\n\nNOBODY’S OPINIONS | Robots and Communism – A Look at Our Future\n\nA spectre is haunting America: the spectre of communism. In a world where more and more tasks are being automated, and more and more people are seeing the skills that separate them from the lower rungs of society reduced to a few lines of code on a computer, more and more people are starting to ask: what makes me more valuable to the company than the guy two floors down who makes half as much as I do?\n\nGRACE’S GROVE | Korean Beauty Products Review – Makeup Edition\n\nKorean cosmetics have been gaining popularity in recent years, and many of the products that used to be sold exclusively in Korea have started to become more accessible here in the US. From 20-step skincare routines to Chateau Labiotte lip tints, there’s definitely a lot going on with Korean beauty that everyone can experiment with.\n\nSAVING FACE | Enough Is Enough: On Racism at Cornell\n\nIt’s a tumultuous time to be Cornell student. A University first founded on the principle of “any person, any study” has proven time and time again that the students themselves do not live up to these words.\n\nKYLIE’S ROOM | 3 Podcasts by Women and/or People of Color You Should Listen To\n\nAlthough there has been significant progress in recent years, there is still a lack of substantial representation of women and people of color in the entertainment industry. With that being said, podcasts are a cheap, readily disseminated way to share stories and cultural experiences.\n\nWELCOME TO THE ZOO | Discussing DACA\n\nWith an open mind and two sides of the story, you’re bound to learn something new. Welcome to the zoo!\n\nOFFICE HOURS | Professor Lena Kourkoutis Discusses Her Research\n\nFor this semester’s first installment of “Office Hours,” a series of interviews with prominent personalities on Cornell’s campus, Sunspots writer Gabriel Ares sat down for a chat with Applied Engineering Physics Professor Lena Kourkoutis. In the interview below, which has been edited for clarity, Kourkoutis talks about a range of topics, from electron microscopy–a technique that allows her to see the atomic structure of objects–to outreach to women in STEM.\n\nBIWEEKLY JOKES FOR EVERYDAY FOLKS | Radical Administrative Changism\n\nSee, Trump, I said it. Just like you wanted me to.\n\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM | Combating White Supremacy Should Not Entail Throwing Other Black Students Under the Bus\n\nOn September 29, The Daily Caller claimed that Black Students United (BSU) at Cornell had insinuated in their list of demands to President Pollack on September 20 that Cornell “is letting in too many African students.” Upon seeing this headline, I dismissed the article as the click bait material straight out of a troll handbook. But because college has taught me to question everything and dismiss nothing, I took another careful look at BSU’s demands.\n\nSERENDIPITY | Insecurity as a Tool for Growth\n\nThis past summer, swaths of bright college students armed with alacrity sauntered into corporate headquarters and satellite offices, hoping to assert themselves in prestigious and difficult internships. For many of us, this time period was nerve wracking and intense.\n\nITHACA WEEK | Which Ithaca Grocery Are You?\n\nIthaca is known for its grocery stores—each with its own distinctive personality. Which one are you?\n\nITHACA WEEK | Building a Home for All in Ithaca\n\nWhat would it be like to return to a home that no longer recognized you? Maybe the people you knew have packed up and left, maybe they are no longer on speaking terms, and you no longer feel at ease.\n\nDESIIGNER | Not All Netflix Views Are Equal\n\nA week ago, my roommate asked me if he could use my Netflix account. At the time, I didn’t think much of it.\n\nITHACA WEEK | The Little Apple\n\nIf Ithaca possessed a “spirit food,” it would be the apple. After living in Ithaca for the past three years, I have consumed way too many apples in solid, liquid, and in-between forms. In their own subtle way, I feel as if apples define Ithaca just as much as the gorges or the freezing cold winters.\n\nITHACA WEEK | Blue Balls\n\nThere are so many great things to do in Ithaca and I’ve certainly collected my fair share of memories and moments that have helped me to call this place home. I remember going to Taughannock Falls as a kid; I’ve been to the Ice, dog, and apple festivals; and I’ve spent days studying in the little coffee shops in The Commons and going to poetry readings at Buffalo Books (often because I was forced to trek down there when a professor didn’t want to support the Capitalist Pigs at the Cornell store).\n\nITHACA WEEK | Ithaca’s Very Own Farmers Market\n\nApril: Amidst the hustle and bustle—the only trace of New York City here in Ithaca—it feels liberating to venture outside every now and then to explore Ithaca and recharge in the loving womb of nature. Don’t let the “there’s nothing to do, Cornell’s in the middle of nowhere” eye-roll mislead you.\n\nKRAVITZ’S KORNER | Trump Was Right To End DACA\n\nPresident Donald Trump is in many ways the antithesis of former President Barack Obama. In the beginning months of his presidency, Trump has attempted to do away with many of Obama’s signature policies, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Paris Climate Accord, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nEMEM ELEMENT | The Illusion of Time\n\nSo, if time is really money, this hangs on the notion that time must indeed be real. Which then, arguably, hangs on the notion that money is inherently real as well.\n\nSUNSPOTS | What Would You Add to the “161 Things Every Cornellian Should Do” List?\n\nThe Cornell Daily Sun’s well-known list of “161 Things Every Cornellian Should Do” is very comprehensive and covers most of the essential Big Red experiences, but not all of them. So we asked our writers and our readers to think of some things that they would add to the list.\n\nTRAVELIN’ WITH JACQUELINE | Another 7 Things You Probably Didn’t Know about Cornell\n\nSince you readers seemed to enjoy my first article on this topic so much, I’ve come back with a second installment to this series with just as interesting and spooky factoids! Here we go:\n\n1) Whispering Bench\n\nWhen I was doing research for my other article last semester, I stumbled onto a thread on College Confidential, in which there was mention of a “whispering bench near Goldwin Smith.” However, after scouring the internet, I could not find any other website or article that referenced this bench!\n\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM | How to Cope with the Loss of a Loved One During Prelims\n\nThe passing of a loved one is never easy. It’s even worse when it happens during prelim season and a continent away from home.\n\nBIWEEKLY JOKES FOR EVERYDAY FOLKS | The Greek Reformer\n\nAt this point in my budding blog I should probably add that these posts are not jokes—they are meant to highlight the contradictions surrounding campus life. Ahh, The Greek Reformer.\n\nAN APPLE A DAY | To Floss or Not to Floss?\n\nIn an ideal world, flossing would be a part of everyone’s hygiene routine. At least that’s according to the American Dental Association.\n\nCULTURALLY SHOOK | The iPhone X Reminds Me That I Am A Person\n\nThat quote about being a tiny speck of dust in the infinite span of the universe—intended to be a comforting reminder that our actions do not merit the importance we delude ourselves into believing they do, and that we should really just relax—is actually quite demoralizing. Maybe it’s the leftover traces of teen angst that have dutifully followed me into my twenties, maybe it’s just how I’m feeling this particular rainy Thursday night—but that quote just makes me kind of sad.\n\nCOFFEE THOUGHTS | Work Work Work Work Work\n\nTaking a step back, I can’t believe we’re already on week 4. My groggy brain tries to do the countdown of how many weeks left until the end of the semester.\n\nEMEM ELEMENT | Psyche and the Presidency\n\nThere is something to be said about people-watching; something to be said about sitting in Olin Library staring out at the people playing Frisbee in the Arts Quad, or perhaps walking down Ho Plaza figuring out how to dodge the quarter card mania properly (NOT me though, I love all of your quarter cards… STAY #woke). From an outsider looking in it’s interesting to ponder, even for a millisecond, the thought processes that encapsulate another person’s mind.\n\nTHE E’ER INSCRUTABLE | Alpha and Omega: Approaching the Issue of Time\n\n“’Εν ἀρχή ῆν ὁ λὀγος, καì ὁ λóγος ῆν πρòς τòν θεóν, καì θεòς ῆν ὁ λóγος. οὗτος ῆν ἐν ἀρχὴ πρòς τòν θεóν.\n\nDESIIGNER | Understanding Customer Service through Design Thinking\n\nA few weeks ago, I received the best haircut of my life. What were my benchmarks?\n\nSAVING FACE | The Asian American Response to Charlottesville\n\nThis piece was written at the time of—and in direct response to—the “Unite the Right” rally and ensuing violence that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday, August 12th. Before you read this article, I suggest that you watch this video from Vice News first.\n\nNOBODY’S OPINIONS | The Death of a Dream\n\nSince Trump rescinded the DREAM Act a few days ago, a number of articles have appeared on the internet citing the extreme cruelty of his decision. Many of these articles make their point by showing a Hispanic male in their early 20s doing something admirable—graduating as Valedictorian from high school, saving people’s lives during Hurricane Harvey, researching a cure for cancer—and juxtaposing it with the inevitable fate Trump has forced upon them just to gain a few political points: being deported to a country they have never known.\n\nKYLIE’S ROOM | Paradise Lost: How the Bachelor Went from Fairytale to Nightmare\n\nI am not ashamed to admit it, but I am an avid Bachelor/Bachelorette/Bachelor in Paradise watcher, debriefer, and obsessor. For the last six months or so, my Monday and Tuesday nights have been dedicated to watching who gets the first impression rose, the ever-coveted one-on-one date, and finally the Neil Lane ring. The franchise’s premise is a bit unorthodox; one person dates 25 people over the course of about 12 weeks in the hopes of getting engaged, then weeks later the Bachelor/Bachelorette rejects get shipped off to Mexico to find love in Paradise.\n\nGRACE’S GROVE | Decoration Inspiration\n\nWhether you love to spend hours on dorm decoration or just want to do the bare minimum, it is undeniable that loving your dorm room is very important. After all, how comfortable you are with your personal space determines how much sleep you get, which affects your ability to get up for those 8am classes, which determines your GPA.\n\nKRAVITZ’S KORNER | The More Important Issue of Charlottesville\n\nThe violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Va. this August turned the idyllic town on the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains into ground-zero of the debate on statues and white supremacy in America.\n\nTHE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM | Weighing in on Interminority Prejudice\n\nOver the summer, I managed to save up for a trip to California, one of the places in America celebrated for its liberalism and openness. Ignoring the sinking feeling that few other tourists would look like me, I set about to explore the Bay Area.\n\nTRAVELIN’ WITH JACQUELINE | The Summer of Love Experience\n\nBefore the contemporary hipster existed, there was the hippie of the 1960s. (Ironically, the term “hippie” was derived from the word “hipster,” which referred to the jazz cats of the 1940s.) Perhaps the most notable year for any hippie is 1967, whenduring which the Summer of Love took place in San Francisco.\n\nBIWEEKLY JOKES FOR EVERYDAY FOLKS | How Cornell Markets Liberal Arts\n\nIt really is something to chuckle at, the way Cornell speaks about liberal arts. Specifically within the College of Arts and Sciences, there exists an issue with the rhetoric surrounding our breadth and depth requirements, which I argue stems from our grade-centered education.\n\nSUNSPOTS | What Advice Would You Give To Your Freshman Self?\n\nSasha Chanko ‘19: Eat your f***ing breakfast. Wake up, have a bar or yogurt or something small in the dining hall.\n\nBIWEEKLY JOKES FOR EVERYDAY FOLKS | This Year Will Be Better!\n\nPart I: The Drive Up\n\nI remember quite clearly my drive up to Cornell in the summer of 2016. It was a lovely day on both ends of my trip—the Upper West Side wishing me good luck in the coming year with a warm, blue sky and Ithaca welcoming me with open arms as its sky held in its bladder to save rain for those driving up from New Jersey.\n\nTRAVELIN’ WITH JACQUELINE | Soundtrack to My Freshman Year\n\nThis entire summer, I’ve been dreading the day that Fall 2017 starts because it will signal the beginning of the second half of my college experience. As I’m honing in on exactly what I should do at the start of this second half, I’ve been reminiscing and reconsidering all the things I did at the start of the first half, by which I mean: freshman year.\n\nSERENDIPITY | 5 Survival Tips and Tricks for New Cornell Students\n\nCornell is a difficult place – colloquially, we are known as the easiest Ivy to get into… but the hardest to graduate from. While many of you are among the swaths of high school valedictorians, science fair winners and speech and debate aficionados, all of you will certainly fail at some point in your college careers.\n\nBANDI | A Big Red Ball\n\nOne of my formative orientation week events was Big Red Ball. For those of you who don’t know what Big Red Ball is, don’t worry—it’s really simple.\n\nARRAY | “That’ll Never Happen To Me”\n\nWhen I teetered into my dorm room on the first day, weighed down by three bags I had lugged across the country, I wasn’t inspired by any sense of new beginning despite all the people offering me their collegiate wisdom and telling me that my life had just begun. I missed home, I missed Mom, I felt like I was still just me, packed up and shipped 3000 miles away.\n\nSUNSPOTS | 10 Things To Do During O-Week While Everyone Else Is Out Partying\n\nIf you’re not one of those people who shows up to Ithaca waaaaay too excited about going to their first college party, have no fear.

This lucky 9-year-old boy is Dylan Harbin, also known by the nickname Pickle.\n\nAKABAS | What is the Nolan-iest Christopher Nolan Film?\n\nAcross three Batman movies, five movies with cool-sounding one-word titles, and one movie you’ve probably never heard of, director Christopher Nolan has developed a distinctive style. So, with his latest film, Dunkirk, hitting theaters today, we’re going to answer a very important question.\n\nAKABAS | 10 NBA Offseason Questions, Asked and Answered\n\nFor how many more finals do you anticipate the two teams will be the Warriors and Cavs (i.e. the next 3,4,5 years?)\n\n– Kyrollos B.\n\nBasically the Warriors’ entire roster is entering free-agency this offseason. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are going to do what it takes to both re-sign, but what about the other guys?\n\nAKABAS | 10 NBA Finals Questions, Asked and Answered\n\nWhen the NBA season came to a close on Monday night, I had too many thoughts to sort out, so I decided to let my friends do it for me by sending me questions. Below are my answers to 10 questions about the 2017 NBA Finals, ranging from most simple to most complex.\n\nAKABAS | Podcast with Psychology Professor David Pizarro\n\nDavid Pizarro has taught Introduction to Psychology and a number of other seminars since becoming an associate professor in 2012, and his research on moral judgement and emotion has been published in countless places, including an article for The Guardian that he co-wrote last month. He was nice enough to be the guest for my first Cornell Daily Sun podcast, during which he discussed his research, shared his thoughts on robots, and answered ten “Speed Round” questions.\n\nWHITE KNUCKLES | Acknowledgments Too Long for My Thesis\n\nWhen I graduated high school, I wrote a farewell piece in the school paper; it came easy, words were flowing without obstacles, I had a lot to say. Four years later, I still have a lot to say; however, this is one of those very few times when I felt that there might not be enough words, or that they will be too small and timid, too controlled, too human.\n\nOFFICE HOURS | 10 Questions with PMA Professor Bruce Levitt\n\nFor our second installment of “Office Hours,” a series of interviews with prominent personalities on Cornell’s campus, Sunspots writer Andrew Shi talked with with Performing and Media Arts Professor Bruce Levitt, who has taught at Cornell since 1986 and is involved with Phoenix Players Theatre Group (PPTG), a prison theatre group at Auburn Correctional Facility.\n\nYou’ve worked with PPTG since 2010.\n\nSHI REVIEWED | Go Set A Watchman\n\nAtticus Finch is racist.

Seriously though, it’s always nice to save some money, so I whenever I go to a museum, I have my Cornell ID ready.\n\nOUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM | The Legacy of Cornell’s Campus\n\nPeople know Ithaca for its beauty.
