        "text": "Just in case you hadn’t figured out what the significance of 78violet meant, sisters Aly and AJ Michalka opened up to ET about the name change and how their music changed along with it. Check it:\n\nAJ shared, “We’re women now and we’re growing up. It was time for a change.”\n\nAly added, “Our sound is changing, and the changes that are happening are natural and it’s been a slow progression.”\n\nAnd what about the meaning of their new band name: “Purple and violet have been a huge part of out lives — it’s a really powerful color. … 78 stands for platinum in the periodic table of elements. … The definition of platinum means that no substance can corrode it, and I was like, ‘Dude, that’s our relationship. We cannot be corroded. Our relationship as sisters is unstoppable.”"
