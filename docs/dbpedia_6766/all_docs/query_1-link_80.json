        "text": "For anyone who used to watch Phil of the Future on Disney Channel, you already know that a boy named Phil and his family were on a vacation from the 22nd century when they ended up stuck in the early aughts. Phil, played by Raviv Ullman, fell in love with his best friend Keely, played by Aly Michalka, and the rest is history.\n\nThough Phil of the Future has been off the air for more than a decade, it seems like the 22nd-century man still keeps in touch with his former costar. Raviv recently posted a picture on Instagram with Aly— and her sister AJ — immediately making fans feeling majorly nostalgic. The crew all reunited at the AMO Ferragamo party on Tuesday night. \"Big ❤️ for these two ol pals and the great music they're making,\" he captioned it. \"They've grown way taller and cooler than I. At least we're all equally pink.\" Our hearts can barely take this blast from the past!\n\nThere's hope for a real Phil and Keely reunion, too. Aly recently revealed that she's still close with one of the producers who wrote several episodes of the series and that she and Raviv see each other whenever they're in the same city. When asked if she would be open to a reboot, she previously said, \"I mean, sure! I guess reunions are a big thing now. I wouldn't be opposed to it. It's a funny idea. I have no idea what they'd do necessarily with the storyline, but yeah, sure.\""
