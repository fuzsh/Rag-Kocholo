        "text": "I still have yet to watch this show but I like Aly\n\nI hate AJ and the name 78violet though\n\nNeeds more Gale.\n\nia\n\nThis.\n\nmy mom stans this girl, and i don't know why. she claims she like her spunky attitude. idk idk. moms.\n\nMARTY/SAVANNAH PLZ\n\nno really i have nothing more to add to this\n\nthey're fucking adorable\n\nOMG THIS.\n\nThey actually have so much chemistry together it's ridiculous.\n\nikr, i keep on getting confused when they set them up with boys\n\nWAIT A MINUTE THEY HAVE A GF\n\n(no subject) - introdelusion Expand\n\nTHIS. I ship them so much.\n\nI like Hellcats!\n\nok OP, favourite female character, without a doubt, has to be Savannah because she is adorable and hilariously awkward. And I like the fact that she didn't turn out to be a massive bitch but was actually really pragmatic about welcoming Marti into the team (see: scene when Marti finds out their roommates and that she actually voted for her).\n\nLeast favourite character, probably Dan because he's boring and does nothing but makes quips about his big, Irish family.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nHmm, I guess Marti's mum? She just really irks me because the character doesn't seem to be aware of the magnitude of the situations she puts Marti in and that's really frustrating.\n\nΙ'm gonna agree on Savannah. She's endearing. She seems innocent, but not stupid & thinks logically. She doesn't seem selfish & act out because she didn't get her way with things.\n\nLeast favourite...Hmm..I also agree that Dan is really boring, but the one that gets on my nerves is Marti's mother. Her character, the way she dresses, everything.\n\nNot enough Gale Harold.\n\nThat is all.\n\nTHIS THIS THIS!\n\nThe only reason I watched it was for him...and he took like forever to come on...and even then he's never on. BOOOOO!\n\nHe's in like 1 scene per ep AKA NOT ENOUGH.\n\n(no subject) - bits_and_tits Expand\n\nTHIS. I can't believe I've been reduced to watching this show just to see him for 40 seconds every other episode.\n\nYES. More Gale and that Southern lilt.\n\nI'm so jealous of her torso!\n\nI have some serious body envy whenever I see her.\n\nMy envy subsides when I re-notice her face.\n\nSame here.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nLMAO same but I felt really bad about it\n\nsame.\n\nWtf is wrong with her bellybutton.\n\nPiercing.\n\ni wonder how hard she had to train for that amazing body.\n\nbitch.\n\nmte\n\nHome taping is killing music.\n\nMy least favorite characters have to be Marti and her mother. Marti can do everything better than anyone, and I find that REALLY annoying and unbelievable. Plus, she always has this attitude where the things she does or said are better than anyone else's. She's always there to save the day! WTH. Her mother is annoying as hell. She always expects her daughter to save her ass, and she acts like she's not even a parent.\n\nSavannah's probably my favorite. She's the only one who surprises me. She could have screwed up people so many times, but she always chooses not to.\n\nI watched the first couple episodes of Hellcats and reallly liked it, then I got bored and stopped paying attention, so I quit watching.\n\nI miss Phil of The Future."
