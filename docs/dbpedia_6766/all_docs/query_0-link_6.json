        "text": "It would be a near-impossibility to cover all the diverse women making art during Women's History Month — and celebrating creators every day, week and month is the goal — but any opportunity to elevate deserving female musicians is one to jump on.\n\nThis March, GRAMMY.com shines a spotlight on female-identifying music-makers. This month's 15 releases include entries from the Phoebe Bridgers-Lucy Dacus-Julien Baker supergroup boygenius, Chloe (of R&B sister duo Chloe x Halle), and indie creators like Lana Del Rabies and Jen Cloher; and Radie Peat of Irish dark folkies Lankum.\n\nFrom bold returns (Sophie B. Hawkins) and buzzy up-and-comers (Nia Archives) to superstars (Miley Cyrus) to metal groundbreakers (Entheos), GRAMMY.com offers up a guide to the must-hear music from women this March.\n\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the new release date for Ellie Goulding’s album.\n\nKali Uchis - Red Moon in Venus\n\nRelease date: March 3\n\nKali Uchis is clearly universal and boundary-crossing in her collaborations and appeal: She was nominated for a 2017 Latin GRAMMY Award for \"El Ratico\" (with Juanes); won a GRAMMY for Best Dance Recording for her feature on Kaytranada's single \"10%\" and was nominated for Best R&B Performance. Uchis (who sings in Spanish and English) has also toured with Lana Del Rey, worked with Diplo, Tyler, the Creator.\n\nOn Red Moon in Venus, her third studio album, the Colombian American singer continues her hot streak. Uchis describes her 15-track LP as a \" timeless, burning expression of desire, heartbreak, faith, and honesty, reflecting the divine femininity of the moon and Venus.\"\n\nJen Cloher – I Am The River the River Is Me\n\nRelease date: March 3\n\nOn I Am The River the River Is Me, the fifth album from Aussie-born singer/songwriter Jen Cloher digs deep into their Māori roots. The LP features songs about theirancestry, with powerful choruses/phrases in the te reo Māori language. The gently intimate single \"Mana Takatāpui\" is rife with sweet ‘70s-sounding guitar work, and celebrates queerness as a Māori woman.\n\nIn contrast, the irresistible \"Being Human\" is delivered with a driving rock ‘n’ roll urgency, dynamics and shimmering and quirky guitar tones. \"My Witch\" also mines creative ‘70s guitar sounds, and as Cloher told NPR, \"It feels immediately fresh. It feels catchy. It's in your ear straight away.\" I Am The River the River Is Me arrives via indie label Milk! Records, run by Cloher in part with Courtney Barnett.\n\nEntheos – Time Will Take Us All\n\nRelease date: March 3\n\nThe progressive metal genre may not be packed with women, but Entheos singer Chaney Crabb is a powerhouse on stage and in the metal scene. Time Will Take Us All, the band’s third release and first for Metal Blade Records, is darker and heavier than previous outings with a wealth of influences.\n\nThe dynamic and melodic \"I Am The Void\" illustrate the album’s concept of \"growth and self-reflection that focuses on the true human commonality – that our time on Earth is fleeting,\" according to a release. Entheos furthers that \"what we choose to do with that knowledge is up to each of us as individuals.\" Entheos, normally a two-piece with drummer and band co-founder Navene Koperweis, will bring an expanded, powerful live lineup on European and American tour dates in 2023.\n\nNia Archives – Sunrise Bang Ur Head Against Tha Wall\n\nRelease date: March 10\n\nMining her life for material, Nia Archives told NME that on Sunrise Bang Ur Head Against Tha Wall, she’s \"broadly talking about growing up as a person, reaching new levels of maturity, love and loss, rejection, estrangement, the come-up and the comedown… It’s six tracks with six different moods soundtracking the recent chapter in my life.\"\n\nThe year 2022 was a big one for the English record producer, DJ and songwriter, whose \"future classic\" sound uses jungle, drum and bass and neo-soul. Along with European and UK dates, look for Archives, who is a 2023 nominee for a Brit Award for Rising Star, to perform her new single \"Conveniency\" — and more — at this year's Coachella.\n\nMiley Cyrus – Endless Summer Vacation\n\nRelease date: March 10\n\nMiley Cyrus has clearly empowered legions of listeners with \"Flowers,'' its lyrics asserting, \"I can take myself dancing / I can hold my own hand / I can love me better than you can.\" With more than 560 million Spotify streams, it's likely that \"Flowers\" and the album it’s on, Endless Summer Vacation, will be laurel in Cyrus’ crown.\n\nAccording to a release, the music and imagery of Endless Summer Vacation serves as a \"reflection of the strength she’s found in focusing on both her physical and mental well-being.\" Cyrus, who produced her album with Kid Harpoon, Greg Kurstin, Mike WiLL Made-It and Tyler Johnson, describes the album as her love letter to LA, where the album was recorded.\n\nFever Ray – Radical Romantics\n\nRelease date: March 10\n\nSwedish singer/songwriter/producer Karin Dreijer, aka Fever Ray, has long earned her music bona fides, kickstarting a career with guitar band Cool Honey, then electronic music duo the Knife, formed with brother Olof Dreijer. Dreijer released their debut solo album under the alias Fever Ray in 2009, and now, the third Fever Ray album features Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross along with sibling Olof.\n\nA visual and musical shape-shifter, Dreijer explained the title Radical Romantics: \"Everything needs to be dissected and loved and torn and built back up again and we're dreamers aren't we?\" On the lead single \"Carbon Dioxide,\" shades of Nina Hagen and ‘80s new wave lead the bubbling, electro-pop tune.\n\nFrankie Rose – Love as Projection\n\nRelease date: March 10\n\nWith a lengthy resume that includes Crystal Stilts, Dum Dum Girls, Vivian Girls and Beverly, Frankie Rose has an impressive legacy, and further cements her status with Love As Projection.\n\nThe drummer/guitarist/singer's sixth solo album melds '80s influences with contemporary electronic pop; the single \"Anything\" sounding like it could be on the soundtrack of a John Hughes movie. (Fittingly, Rose interpreted the Cure’s iconic Seventeen Seconds LP in 2019.) \"This album is about having to focus our collective energies on the small things…we can control to find joy,\" Rose told the Vinyl Factory. \"A distraction from the larger systemic problems that feel so overwhelming and are so very out of our collective hands… for now.\"\n\nLankum – False Lankum\n\nRelease date: March 24\n\n\"Go Dig My Grave\" from 2023’s False Lankum is nearly 9 minutes long, featuring singer Radie Peat’s plainspoken singing and ominous, mesmerizing musicality inspired by the Irish tradition of keening (lament). Together, these effects create a marching doom vibe. The dark folk lineup (Cormac Dermody, and brothers Ian and Daragh Lynch), utilize traditional Irish instruments, including uilleann pipes, along with guitars, percussion, fiddle, banjo, piano and double bass. Peat employs bayan, concertina, harmonium, organ, electric organ, harp, mellotron for a sound that mines the traditional for a modern context.\n\nThe end result, as The Guardian described, contains \"ambient textures of Sunn O))) and Swans, plus the sonic intensity of Xylouris White and My Bloody Valentine.\" False Lankum follows the Dublin doom folk quartet’s 2019 breakthrough The Livelong Day, which garnered the band numerous awards in Ireland, including the RTE Choice Music Prize (Ireland’s equivalent to the Album of the Year GRAMMY).\n\nSophie B. Hawkins – Free Myself\n\nRelease date: March 24\n\nSophie B. Hawkins' 2023 \"anti-Valentine\" song \"Better Off Without You\" features wrenching words about an ex: \"We changed the world / Until you took my best friend to bed.\" The song and sentiment appear on Free Myself, the singer/songwriter’s first album in more than a decade.\n\nTracks such as \"Love Yourself\" and \"I’m Tired Of Taking Care Of You\" further themes of romantic empowerment. The Free Myself, Hawkin's seventh studio album, shows the multi-instrumentalist in top form: raw, poetic but accessible and relatable, as inclusion of her tracks in cinematic and moody television shows \"Ozark,\" \"Stranger Things\" and \"Euphoria\" have proven.\n\nLana Del Rabies – STREGA BEATA\n\nRelease date: March 17\n\nLana Del Rabies is the alter-ego of Phoenix-based musician, producer and multimedia artist Sam An. In her Del Rabies guise, as hinted at by the moniker, An seeks to \"re-contextualize the more ominous aspects of modern pop music made by women,\" creating what she calls a \"dark electronic, genre-bridging solo project.\" As such, she’s done a spare, industrial take on Tori Amos’ \"Cornflake Girl,'' plus two LPs, including the boldly titled In the End I Am a Beast.\n\nOn her third full-length album, STREGA BEATA (loosely translated as \"Blessed Witch\") Del Rabies delves into dark themes, buoyed by elements of industrial, gothic noise, metal, darkwave and ambient. From opener \"Prayers of Consequence\" to the final cut, \"Forgive,\" the album, as its creator explains, \"is told through the evolving perspective of a cryptic and obscure \"Mother\" creator figure, specifically echoing the mother and crone goddess archetypes.\"\n\nLana Del Rey - Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd\n\nRelease date: March 24\n\nLana Del Rabies is the alter-ego of Phoenix-based musician, producer and multimedia artist Sam An. In her Del Rabies guise, as hinted at by the moniker, An seeks to \"re-contextualize the more ominous aspects of modern pop music made by women,\" creating what she calls a \"dark electronic, genre-bridging solo project.\" As such, she’s done a spare, industrial take on Tori Amos’ \"Cornflake Girl,'' plus two LPs, including the boldly titled In the End I Am a Beast.\n\nOn her third full-length album, STREGA BEATA (loosely translated as \"Blessed Witch\") Del Rabies delves into dark themes, buoyed by elements of industrial, gothic noise, metal, darkwave and ambient. From opener \"Prayers of Consequence\" to the final cut, \"Forgive,\" the album, as its creator explains, \"is told through the evolving perspective of a cryptic and obscure \"Mother\" creator figure, specifically echoing the mother and crone goddess archetypes.\"\n\nBoygenius – The Record\n\nRelease date: March 31\n\nBoygenius is made up of the girl geniuses Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus, together a super-group collective whose debut EP expanded minds in 2017. As Baker told Newsweek, the trio of friends took the tongue-in-cheek band name because of \"the archetype of the tortured genius, [a] specifically male artist who has been told since birth that their every thought is not only worthwhile but brilliant.\"\n\nThe trio’s debut full-length, The Record, offers bright indie rock bounce on \"$20,\" a low-key haunting on \"Emily I'm Sorry\" and to the straight-ahead fullness on \"True Blue.\" Other intriguing song titles from the full-length include \"Leonard Cohen\" \"Satanist.\" In addition to a headlining tour, boygenius will appear at Coachella in 2023.\n\nDeerhoof – Miracle-Level\n\nRelease date: March 31\n\nDeerhoof singer/bassist/songwriter Satomi Matsuzaki’s origin story is the stuff of dreams: She joined Deerhoof within a week of immigrating to the United States from Japan in May 1995 to attend college. And in 2023, the singer and self-taught bassist is front and center on Miracle-Level, Deerhoof’s 19th LP and the first sung in Satomi’s native Japanese. It’s also the influential DIY band’s first to be made totally in a professional recording studio with a producer (Mike Bridavsky).\n\nMiracle-Level kicks off with the joyful noise of \"Sit Down, Let Me Tell You a Story,\" and contains the delightfully oddball \"My Lovely Cat!\" plus one song that’s as awkward but interesting as its title: \"Phase-Out All Remaining Non-Miracles by 2028.\"\n\nCritical praise has been near-universal over the lineup’s career, the New Yorker praising an \"adventurous compositional style that features complex rhythms, electronica, atonal flourishes, and the pacific singing of Satomi Matsuzaki, whose sonic detachment from the group’s noisier and more aggressive side is curiously affecting.\"\n\nChloe Bailey - In Pieces\n\nRelease date: March 31\n\nAs half of the GRAMMY-nominated powerhouse R&B duo Chloe x Halle, Chloe debuted as a solo artist in 2021 with platinum single \"Have Mercy.\" The singer/dancer/producer’s full-length solo debut, In Pieces, launches with the sonorous \"Pray It Away\" before then teaming with Chris Brown for her \"How Does It Feel\" single. Inspired by naysayers, Chloe posted about In Pieces on her Instagram, writing \"My tears are like the water. My heart is like the sun. Through chaos, beauty grows. There’s power in my pain.. It’s me breaking free.\"\n\nEllie Goulding – Higher Than Heaven\n\nRelease date: April 17 (adjusted)\n\nOn the energetic new single \"Like a Saviour,\" Ellie Goulding expresses what so many felt during the last several years: \"Trying to find my faith in tomorrow\" and wishing for a saviour to lead her \"out of the dark.\" The tune, off Higher Than Heaven, the English singer-songwriter’s fifth album, was inspired by the pandemic. But it’s not a wallow in darkness. In short: Expect musical and lyrical celebrations of love and sex, plus the wisdom and power of cutting out when things go bad.\n\nAs Goulding teased on Instagram: \"‘Let it Die’ is about when a relationship plays out much longer than it needed to. Instead of giving love to yourself you spend it all on someone else and have nothing left, which is when it can become toxic and harmful.\" \"Let It Die,\" which has notched 13 million streams, preceded the LP, along with \"Easy Lover\" (featuring Big Sean) and \"All by Myself.\" Given the singles’ out-of-the-box success, it’ll be no surprise if Goulding has another \"Love Me Like You Do\" (from the Fifty Shades of Gray soundtrack) on her hands, the hit that earned Goulding her first GRAMMY nom for Best Pop Solo Performance.\n\nListen To GRAMMY.com's Women's History Month 2023 Playlist: Swim In The Divine Feminine With These 40 Songs By Rihanna, SZA, Miley Cyrus, BLACKPINK & More\n\nWhen it comes to exploring Lana Del Rey's discography, it can be hard to know where to start. The pop songstress has a sprawling catalog, consisting of nine albums, four EPs, and a handful of other standalone singles.\n\nYou could begin with Born To Die, her highly influential major label debut, or its moody follow-up, Ultraviolence, her first to top the Billboard charts and ultimately establish her staying power as an artist. Perhaps you choose to start with her Album Of The Year GRAMMY nominees Norman F—ing Rockwell! or Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd.\n\nOr maybe you're an incredibly diehard fan with encyclopedic knowledge who wants to start where it all began, on Rey's first album Lana Del Ray (note the spelling difference), which never saw official physical release and contained just a rough draft of the cultural force Del Rey would become.\n\nFollowing Del Rey's career is rewarding, but requires some commitment to listen to, and understand, everything she's put out. It can be intimidating to approach an artist with such a robust, varied catalog. You can go with more mainstream pop offerings like her collaborations with Taylor Swift and The Weeknd, or dive into something more inspired by the orchestra like early track \"National Anthem.\" This is true for fans with any amount of exposure to Del Rey, from those just discovering her music to those looking to become an expert.\n\nAs Ultraviolence turns 10, GRAMMY.com presents the levels of Lana, a series of jumping off points to explore all the music Del Rey has to offer. Dig into three songs across four different levels of fandom — Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, and Diehard — to further your Lana knowledge. These songs give a peek into various aspects of Del Rey's body of work, and serve as encouragement to continue exploring.\n\nBeginner\n\n\"Summertime Sadness,\" Born to Die (2012)\n\nThe Beginner Level of Lana is for those who have heard of Del Rey, but have never sat down with her music before. This makes \"Summertime Sadness,\" her biggest song to date, the perfect place to start.\n\nIt's reductive to simply label Del Rey's oeuvre \"sad girl music,\" but for the uninitiated, it's a simple descriptor to start with. \"Summertime Sadness\" combines the pop production, elements of classical music, and existential despair that is present throughout Del Rey's career. And Cedric Gervais' remix has turned \"Summertime Sadness\" into a club banger to help her appeal to those who gravitate more to the dance floor.\n\n\"Young and Beautiful,\" The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film (2013)\n\nIt speaks to Del Rey's cultural reach and musical vision that a non-album single is one of her most iconic songs. Written for the 2013 The Great Gatsby movie adaptation, \"Young and Beautiful\" also serves as a helpful thematic introduction to Del Rey.\n\nThroughout her writing, Del Rey examines youth, Americana, and the American Dream, and how each of these uniquely American ideals are full of decay and liable to corruption and disappointment. On \"Young and Beautiful,\" she asks if her lover will still care when she's no longer either of those things, and the somber tone indicates the likely answer. This song will introduce fans to Del Rey's penchant for using orchestral backing for her music, and illustrate how intertwined with popular culture she really is.\n\n\"Mariners Apartment Complex,\" Norman F—ing Rockwell! (2019)\n\nThe past two songs have introduced Del Rey's \"sad girl\" persona, but over the years, she has evolved far past being so easily defined. \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" is the perfect next step for beginners, opening up the popular perception to her to reveal more of her complexity.\n\nLyrically, it finds Del Rey pushing back on sorrow being her only emotion. Musically, it's a great introduction to more of the ethereal, synth-filled sound that has come out of her partnership with superproducer Jack Antonoff. And in terms of placing her within the culture, \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" is the first single from her sixth album Norman F—ing Rockwell!, which earned Del Rey her first Album Of The Year nomination in 2019.\n\nIntermediate\n\n\"Brooklyn Baby,\" Ultraviolence (2014)\n\nAt the Intermediate level, it's time to start getting into more of the nuances that Del Rey brings to her writing — and, in turn, how much she's influenced her peers, and how respected she is amongst them.\n\n\"Brooklyn Baby\" is some of her sharpest writing, equal parts playful needling and affectionate tribute to the snooty New York art scene. One of the most indelible tracks off of Ultraviolence, the song epitomizes the entire record's move towards more rock instrumentation, with a guitar-based sound. It references legendary rock artist Lou Reed, who was slated to appear on the track before his death in late 2013, showing just how highly she's thought of by other artists.\n\n\"Love,\" Lust for Life (2017)\n\nFor as much as Del Rey recognizes how fallible many of our culture's ideals are, she's always been a romantic. \"Love,\" the first single from 2017's Lust for Life, is a prime example of this.\n\nThe whole album is a big play on her love of classic Hollywood imagery, including the video for \"Love,\" and the song is a dreamy throwback to '50s love songs. If \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" chides anyone thinking Del Rey can only be sad, \"Love\" is a full rebuke, as it's one of her most straightforwardly optimistic tracks. Commercially, \"Love\" was Del Rey's highest-charting feat since Ultraviolence (landing at No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100), further establishing that she had longevity.\n\n\"Chemtrails over the Country Club,\" Chemtrails over the Country Club (2021)\n\n2020 and the pandemic did a number on everyone, radically altering lives and shaking faith in many of the institutions of everyday life. That unmooring is felt on Del Rey's seventh album, Chemtrails over the Country Club, and particularly on its title track.\n\nDel Rey is as sharp as ever in exploring the pulse of American society on the dreamy, disaffected number. \"You're in the wind, I'm in the water/ Nobody's son, nobody's daughter\" is a breathtaking piece of writing that became a TikTok favorite, illustrating Del Rey's continuing ability to relate to the youth.\n\nExpert\n\n\"F—ed My Way Up To the Top,\" Ultraviolence (2014)\n\nAs we enter the realm of the Expert Lana Del Rey fan, we're firmly out of album singles territory. From here, it's all deep cuts and non-album tracks.\n\nDel Rey has been no stranger to controversy — some warranted, some not. An early knock against her was that the mid-20th century aesthetic and perceived submissiveness in her music was anti-women or anti-feminist, a surface-level reading that in the years since has been largely dispelled.\n\nThe singer has worked to combat it herself on tracks like Ultraviolence's \"F—ed My Way Up To the Top,\" which takes that perceived notion to its extreme. At the same time, it's another in a long line of tracks in which Del Rey has embraced her own sexuality and sensuality as something to be celebrated and claimed, not something to be ashamed of.\n\n\"Art Deco,\" Honeymoon (2015)\n\n2015's Honeymoon isn't necessarily underappreciated, as it received positive reviews upon release debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, but \"Art Deco\" isn't likely to appear on many playlists. It should, though, as the track illustrates how much of musical chameleon Del Rey really is, with a sultry, hip-hop inspired rolling beat.\n\nIt treads some familiar territory thematically with trying to find acceptance in night life, but Del Rey is really comfortable here. She shows more of her knowledge of art history by relating the subject of the song to the defining characteristics of the titular art movement, revealing just how much thought she puts into her aesthetic.\n\n\"Fingertips,\" Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd (2023)\n\nDid you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd is arguably Del Rey's most intimate album, exploring details of her family and their history that fans have only previously seen brief glimpses of. At the same time, it is partially an examination of her own legacy and work, only natural for someone with as much output as Del Rey, let alone her frequent references to death and finality.\n\nBoth of these things combine in \"Fingertips,\" a standout track from the album. A nearly six-minute long ballad, it's musically airy while emotionally devastating — and, for a true Del Rey fan, encapsulates so much of her legacy in just one song.\n\nDiehard\n\n\"Yayo,\" Paradise (2012)\n\nFor fans in the Diehard level, everything before is old news. This is for fans who want to fully live the Lana life, who have all her albums on vinyl and have carefully built their image and fashion around her.\n\nSpeaking of her image, this section starts with \"Yayo,\" an extremely early deep cut. This track originally appeared on Lana Del Ray before being reworked and rereleased on the Paradise EP in 2012. The song leans heavier than most into the '50s imagery and floats along at a dreamy, lilting pace. While not as refined as her later work, \"Yayo\" is an indicator Del Rey had a solid idea of who she wanted to be as soon as she started.\n\n\"Season of the Witch,\" Non-album Single (2019)\n\nDel Rey has done several covers throughout her career, and quite successfully. Norman F—ing Rockwell! features her cover of Sublime's \"Doin' Time,\" which is one of the highlight tracks from the record. Less known is Del Rey's spooky cover of '60s classic \"Season of the Witch.\"\n\nWritten for the 2019 horror film Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, the song fits Del Rey's style perfectly. The Americana/flower crown aesthetic of her younger years always leaned witch-adjacent, and Del Rey takes her soft vocals into playfully sinister territory. It's a fun cover, and shows just how many gems Del Rey has in her discography for those fans willing to dig.\n\n\"Say Yes to Heaven,\" Non-album Single (2023)\n\n\"Say Yes to Heaven\" was never supposed to be heard. A late cut from Ultraviolence, the track remained buried for years before being leaked in 2016. It lurked on the internet, only known to superfans, before gaining steam with the rise of TikTok and finally seeing an official release in 2023.\n\nThe deep cut is peak Del Rey ballad material, a tender love song imploring her partner to accept happiness. It's another rebuke of the idea that she can't be happy, and it gives insight into some of her earlier writing.\n\nAs a resurfaced older track, \"Say Yes to Heaven\" may not necessarily indicate the direction Lana Del Rey is set to go on her forthcoming album, Lasso (especially considering Del Rey has teased she's \"going country\" for her next release). But it's a beautiful reminder of the affecting narratives and arresting vocals that have made her beloved to so many, no matter the level of fandom.\n\nSongbook: A Guide To Billie Eilish's Musical Ventures & Artistic Ingenuity\n\nPrimavera Sound is known for its heavy-hitting lineup and even bigger surprise guests. The Spanish festival celebrated 20 years in 2024, and transformed Barcelona's Parc del Fòrum into a masterclass of genre diversity and LGBTQIA+ inclusivity. There, under mostly sun-soaked skies, a wide range of international and native acts lit up multiple stages from May 29 - June 2.\n\nPrimavera Barcelona always promises an eclectic mix of performances that showcase native Spanish talent as well as major international headliners to get the party going. However, it’s not just the massive talent that pulls in the crowd. While the mainstages were graced by American superstars Lana Del Rey, SZA and Troye Sivan, the festival’s line-up was elevated by the vibrant non-stop DJ stylings of rising Brazilian star Clementaum and the divinity of Arca — who was rightfully labeled \"madre!\" by a buzzed up Boiler Room x Cupra activation.\n\nPrimavera Sound’s diverse lineup guaranteed a highlight for every kind of festival goer: from the dad rocker to the 20-something throwing themselves head-first into new music. The festival amped up the energy and was keen to ensure a safe space for all music lovers (including regularly signposting a pro-LGBTQIA+ \"Nobody Is Normal\" campaign). If you weren't in Barcelona to experience the magic happening at Parc del Fòrum, read on for nine highlights from Primavera Sound BCN.\n\nArca Delivers A Divine Boiler Room Performance\n\nDrawing on heavy doses of electronica, pop and techno, Venezuelan producer and DJ Arca’s unpinnable sound is exactly what made her sets unmissable. Arca set Primavera alight with two incredible sets: an early morning rave on the Amazon Music Stage on May 31, and a second, more intimate event inside Boiler Room x Cupra’s industrial set up on June 1.\n\nThe musician's Boiler Room set brought the club to Barcelona, weathering attendees through a humid thunderstorm with sweaty, fusion beats and remixes (Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Zedd) that made her experimental anthems even more exceptional.\n\nRead more: 8 Essential Latin Electronic Releases: Songs And Albums From Bizarrap, Arca & More\n\nVampire Weekend Ignite Indie Nostalgia On Their Primavera Return\n\nWe all love a bit of Spanish sunshine, but nobody seemed quite as home on-stage as Vampire Weekend. Having last played at the festival in 2008, the 16-year wait was well worth it with a set list doused with indie rock nostalgia and new bangers that kept the late-night crowd grooving.\n\nIt’s not easy to keep a mainstage crowd going on opening night (especially as the band faced some line-up changes for the festival) but Vampire Weekend's catalog-spanning performance rocked. They ran though hits \"A-Punk, \"Campus\" \"Oxford Comma,\" and new tracks (\"Classical\", \"Gen-X Cops\", \"Connect\") from their new fifth album, Only God Was Above Us – a record which frontman Ezra Koeing described as \"feeling perfect\" on stage.\n\nNo Vampire Weekend set is complete with some curveball covers. This year, to match the beat of their long-overdue festival return, the band kept things fresh with an incredible cover of Sbtrkt’s \"New Drop, New York\" performed against a smokey, dark red stage backdrop. Whether performing their own catalog, making surprise appearance alongside French rock band Phoenix or dropping electric covers, Vampire Weekend prove they’re music more than hitmakers — they’re also a summer festival bucket list act too.\n\nTroye Sivan Kept His Headliner Set Hot\n\nTroye Sivan kicked off his mainstage set on Friday night dripping with innuendo. Replete with sexy outfit changes (including a pair of crotchless pants), effortlessly cool choreography and a very well-positioned mic in his pelvic region, the two-time GRAMMY nominee showed Barcelona that he not only has stadium-worthy tunes but is a stadium-worthy performer. Performing a medley of hits from his third studio album Something To Give You, Sivan's infectious pop tracks were perfectly timed to sexy and immaculately polished dance choreography (featuring his reliable backup dancer troupe of Simone Nolasco, Mauro van de Kerkhof, Benjamin Williams, Ainsley Hall Ricketts and Theo Maddix) against a campily creative set.\n\nThe singer yearned alongside Spanish musician guitarricadelafuente on a silver silk bed as they duetted \"In My Room,\" and belted out Ariana Grande’s \"supernatural\" in front of a mesmerizing anime video backdrop. Whether it was intimately crooning to synth-pop summer banger \"Honey\" or throwback hit \"1999,\" Sivan was undoubtedly a mainstage highlight. As he wrapped up his set, the singer shouted out Barcelona's art and culture as an inspiration for Something To Give You. The Primavera performance was one of the biggest shows of his life, and closed this set with his anthem queer hit \"RUSH.\"\n\nRead more: Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee: Troye Sivan On \"Rush,\" The Importance Of Dance-Pop & The Spirituality Of Partying\n\nYeule Opens Primavera With An Electric Set\n\nKitted out with tattoos, American flag-styled cargo trousers, a heather gray bikini top and chunky boots, yeule is exactly as you see them: an uncategorizable phenomenon. While their set clashed with major alt-metal and indie acts Deftones and Pulp, yeule’s distorted, glitchy universe was more than immersive; it was an electronic, energetic undertaking that swept the audience away. Away from the main stages, yeule’s set felt like a charged techo-pop portal to their world of emotional, alt-rock tunes.\n\nShaped by everything from nu-metal, Avril Lavigne and My Chemical Romance, yeule sounds neither human nor computerized. Often conceptualized as being something of a \"cyborg identity,\" yeule's music translates with a darkly alluring style onstage. They opened with the melodic \"Electric\" from their second studio album Glitch Princess, while the rest of the setlist beautifully emulated their recent album Softscares; an emotional futuristic electro-pop record. The musician’s punk rock inflected \"cybermeat,\" \"sulky baby\" and \"dazies\" were highlights, pulling the crowd closer to the stage as well as new listeners in from nearby smaller stages.\n\nPerforming against a flickering urban city backdrop illuminated the midnight sky, yeule's set created the perfect isolated, small-stage universe to hear their deafening screamo notes during \"Bite My Neck\" and the hauntingly mellow electro-rock closeout track \"software update.\"\n\nClementaum Brings The Brazilian Party Spirit To The Boiler Room\n\nThe Boiler Room x Cupra stage was the place to be this year. While the Parc del Fòrum never fails to pull together an eclectic mix of talent, Primavera Sound truly thrived in showing its ability to channel the club, ballroom and EDM into a live festival setting. There was never a set that didn’t bring the festival goers in glam outfits and the ultimate dance party vibes. However, the raging techno beats of Clementaum that most caught our attention.\n\nPlaying to a packed room with festival-goers tightly crammed in even behind her decks, Clementaum led a chant (\"Vai Brazil!\") as her country’s flag was proudly waved in the crowd. Feeling more like a late-night rave, the Brazilian DJ had us thriving on deep beat drops and pummeling beats that you couldn’t help but dance to. Artfully skilled, Clementaum fuses Afro-Latin rhythms, ballroom culture and amped-up electronica for an incredible, heart-racing high.\n\nThe trance beat-packed El NICK DGO x Clementaum banger \"Dale Pal Party\" had everybody dancing, while a full-throttle remix of \"Puttuna\" pushed things into another level. However, her live rendition of \"Pirigótika\" (a track with Brazilian singer Bibi Babydoll) was her hallmark performance, and proved that if you haven’t heard of Clementaum, be sure this won’t be the last time you come across her name.\n\nAmaarae’s Captivating Set Can't Be Boxed In By Genre\n\nThere’s nothing Amaarae can’t do. Taking over the Amazon Music stage on May 30, the Ghanaian American Afrobeats musician can take on anything from punk to R&B. In Barcelona, Amaarae’s chameleonic talent showcases that no style (or genre) is too much for her to turn into a captivating set.\n\nAmaarae proved that whatever mood she brings to stage, she devours, from effortlessly performing slow burner \"Wasted Eyes\" to silkily switching to \"Disguise,\" a song of desire and domination, and segueing to alternative anthem \"Sex, Violence, Suicide.\"\n\nLearn more: Meet The Latest Wave Of Rising Afrobeats Stars: AMAARAE, BNXN, Oladapo & More\n\nCharli XCX Proves Her Pop Legacy For Primavera’s Final Night\n\nNobody throws a party like the ultimate \"it\" girl Charli XCX. From ranging pop bangers (\"I Love It\" to \"Party 4 U\"), the British pop star kept crowds dancing until 4 a.m. — and for good reason. While fans weren’t frightened away by heavy rain and thunderstorms during the festival’s final night, Charli XCX and her fans made Primavera’s final night one to remember.\n\nAnd, if you were lucky, you might’ve caught the star pull off an incredible surprise DJ set alongside co-collaborator A.G Cook, and finance The 1975 band member George Daniel. While the early announced pop-up set for her upcoming sixth studio album Brat fell just outside of the festival on Sunday, the sweaty beach-side crowd was packed with fans flocking from Primavera Sound to make sure they got their early hit of Charli XCX ahead of her mainstage set later that night.\n\nEthel Cain Gets Political (And Personal)\n\nFollowing the breakthrough of her sophomore album Preacher’s Daughter, Ethel Cain has been on an unstoppable rise. A goth-pop mix of Lana Del Ray and heartland-style emo rock, the Tallahassee-born musician is crafting her own Americana aesthetic shaped by desire, death and South Baptist Christian influences.\n\nWhile playing a late afternoon set, the singer stepped out under the blazing sun delivering incredible vocals to fan favorites \"Crush’’ and \"House of Nebraska.\" The singer’s set highlights were elevated by two things: a new song and a political call-out that broke the divide between the festival crowd and on-stage artist. Dressed in a ‘Free Palestine’ t-shirt and with a keffiyeh hanging from her mic, the musician denounced genocide and advocated for the people of Gaze before launching into her viral anti-pop song, \"American Teenager.\"\n\nAmidst her anti-war advocacy, the singer also slotted into a somber new song \"Amber Waves,\" showcasing her penchant for eerie melodies and what fans can expect on her currently untitled upcoming project.\n\nLearn more: 15 LGBTQIA+ Artists Performing At 2024 Summer Festivals\n\nSZA Brings Stardom, Swords & The Splits To 'SOS' Set\n\nWhether it’s the instantly recognizable intro to \"Good Days\" or the viral rotations of \"Kill Bill,\" SZA has long been dominating and driving contemporary pop and R&B. The GRAMMY winner highlighted her artistic versatility with deep cuts and chart hits (including those from her massively popular sophomore album SOS) to a packed mainstage crowd.\n\nWith a stage set designed to look like a ship, SZA was amplifying the message of SOS loud and clear – with hits, charismatic stage movements and impressive vocals to match. And, she didn’t stop there. From knife play routine to \"Kill Bil\" to full-throttle Miley Cryus-style and riding an anchor to dropping the splits mid-set, SZA gave a performance that continuously raised the bar.\n\nRead more: How 'SOS' Transformed SZA Into A Superstar & Solidified Her As The Vulnerability Queen\n\nMusic Festivals 2024 Guide: Lineups & Dates For Lollapalooza, Coachella, Bonnaroo & Much More\n\nLatest Music Festival News\n\n\"...and you're watching Disney Channel!\" For anyone who grew up in the 2000s, those five words likely trigger some pretty vivid imagery: a glowing neon wand, an outline of Mickey Mouse's ears, and every Disney star from Hilary Duff to the Jonas Brothers.\n\nNearly 20 years later, many of those child stars remain instantly recognizable — and often mononymous — to the millions of fans who grew up with them: Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato. Nick, Kevin and Joe.\n\nEach of those names has equally memorable music attached to it — tunes that often wrap any given millennial in a blanket of nostalgia for a time that was, for better or for worse, \"So Yesterday.\" And all of those hits, and the careers that go with them, have the same starting point in Hollywood Records, Disney Music Group's pop-oriented record label.\n\nThis time in Disney's history — the core of which can be traced from roughly 2003 to 2010 — was impactful on multiple fronts. With its music-oriented programming and multi-platform marketing strategies, the network launched a procession of teen idols whose music would come to define the soundtrack to millennials' lives, simultaneously breaking records with its Disney Channel Original Movies, TV shows and soundtracks.\n\nNow, two decades later, Disney Music Group launched the Disney 2000s campaign, honoring the pivotal, star-making era that gave fans a generation of unforgettable pop music. The campaign will last through August and lead directly into D23 2024: The Ultimate Fan Event with special vinyl releases of landmark LPs and nostalgic social media activations occurring all summer long. April's campaign activation was Disney 2000s Weekend at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, which featured special screenings of 2008's Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert and 2009's Hannah Montana: The Movie and Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience.\n\nBut before Miley and the JoBros, Hollywood Records' formula for creating relatable (and bankable) teen pop stars began with just one name: Hilary Duff. At the time, the bubbly blonde girl next door was essentially the face of the network thanks to her starring role in \"Lizzie McGuire,\" and she'd just made the leap to the big screen in the summer of 2003 with The Lizzie McGuire Movie. In her years with Disney, Duff had dabbled in recording songs for Radio Disney, and even released a Christmas album under Buena Vista Records. However, her first album with Hollywood Records had the potential to catapult her from charming tween ingénue to bonafide teen pop star — and that's exactly what it did.\n\nReleased on August 26, 2003, Duff's Metamorphosis sold more than 200,000 copies in its first week and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The following week, the bubblegum studio set performed the rare feat of rising from No. 2 to No. 1, making the then-16-year-old Duff the first solo artist under 18 to earn a No. 1 album since Britney Spears.\n\nThe album's immediate success was no fluke: Within a matter of months, Metamorphosis had sold 2.6 million copies. Music videos for its radio-friendly singles \"So Yesterday\" and \"Come Clean\" received constant airplay between programming on the Disney Channel. (The latter was eventually licensed as the theme song for MTV's pioneering teen reality series \"Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County,\" giving it an additional boost as a cultural touchstone of the early '00s.) A 33-date North American tour soon followed, and Hollywood Records officially had a sensation on their hands.\n\nNaturally, the label went to work replicating Duff's recipe for success, and even looked outside the pool of Disney Channel stars to develop new talent. Another early signee was Jesse McCartney. With a soulful croon and blonde mop, the former Dream Street member notched the label another big win with his 2004 breakout hit \"Beautiful Soul.\"\n\n\"When 'Beautiful Soul' became the label's first No. 1 hit at radio, I think that's when they really knew they had something,\" McCartney tells GRAMMY.com. \"Miley [Cyrus] and the Jonas Brothers were signed shortly after that success and the rest is history.\n\n\"The thing that Disney really excelled at was using the synergy of the channel with promoting songs at pop,\" he continues. \"I did appearances on 'Hannah Montana' and 'The Suite Life of Zack & Cody' and my music videos were pushed to Disney Channel. The marketing was incredibly brilliant and I don't think there has been anything as connected with an entire generation like that since then.\"\n\nBy 2006, Disney had nearly perfected its synergistic formula, continually launching wildly popular tentpole franchises like High School Musical and The Cheetah Girls, and then giving stars like Vanessa Hudgens and Corbin Bleu recording contracts of their own. (Curiously, the pair's HSM co-star Ashley Tisdale was never signed to Hollywood Records, instead releasing her first two solo albums with Warner.)\n\nAly Michalka showed off her vocal chops as sunny girl next door Keely Teslow on \"Phil of the Future,\" and fans could find her off-screen as one half of sibling duo Aly & AJ. In between their 2005 debut album Into the Rush and its electro-pop-charged follow-up, 2007's Insomniatic, Aly and her equally talented younger sister, AJ, also headlined their own Disney Channel Original Movie, Cow Belles. (Duff also helped trailblaze this strategy with her own early DCOM, the ever-charming Cadet Kelly, in 2002, while she was simultaneously starring in \"Lizzie McGuire.\")\n\nEven after years of proven success, the next class of stars became Disney's biggest and brightest, with Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers all joining the network — and record label — around the same time. \"Hannah Montana\" found Cyrus playing a spunky middle schooler by day and world-famous pop star by night, and the network leveraged the sitcom's conceit to give the Tennessee native (and daughter of '90s country heartthrob Billy Ray Cyrus) the best of both worlds.\n\nAfter establishing Hannah as a persona, the series' sophomore soundtrack introduced Miley as a pop star in her own right thanks to a clever double album that was one-half Hannah's music and one-half Miley's. It's literally there in the title: Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus.\n\nFrom there, Cyrus' stardom took off like a rocket as she scored back-to-back No.1 albums and a parade of Top 10 hits like \"See You Again,\" \"7 Things,\" \"The Climb,\" \"Can't Be Tamed,\" and the ever-so-timeless anthem \"Party in the U.S.A.\"\n\nAt the same time, Gomez had top billing on her own Disney Channel series, the magical (but less musical) \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\" That hardly stopped her from launching her own music career, though, first by fronting Selena Gomez & the Scene from 2008 to 2012, then eventually going solo with the release of 2013's Stars Dance after the \"Wizards\" finale aired.\n\nFor her part, Lovato — Gomez's childhood bestie and \"Barney & Friends\" costar — got her big break playing Mitchie Torres in Camp Rock alongside the Jonas Brothers as fictional boy band Connect 3, led by Joe Jonas as the swaggering and floppy-haired Shane Gray. Much like Duff had five years prior in the wake of The Lizzie McGuire Movie, Lovato released her debut solo album, 2008's Don't Forget, just three months after her DCOM broke records for the Disney Channel.\n\nBuilding off their chemistry from the movie musical, nearly the entirety of Don't Forget was co-written with the Jonas Brothers, who released two of their own albums on Hollywood Records — 2007's Jonas Brothers and 2008's A Little Bit Longer — before getting their own short-lived, goofily meta Disney series, \"Jonas,\" which wrapped weeks after the inevitable Camp Rock sequel arrived in September 2010.\n\nAs the 2000s gave way to the 2010s, the Disney machine began slowing down as its cavalcade of stars graduated to more grown-up acting roles, music and careers. But from Duff's Metamorphosis through Lovato's 2017 LP, Tell Me You Love Me, Hollywood Records caught lightning in a bottle again and again and again, giving millennials an entire generation of talent that has carried them through adulthood and into the 2020s.\n\nTo commemorate the Disney 2000s campaign, GRAMMY.com crafted a playlist to look back on Disney's golden age of pop with favorite tracks from Hilary Duff, Vanessa Hudgens, the Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and more. Listen and reminisce below.\n\nWhile every headliner at last year’s Coachella held some sort of historical cultural significance, Coachella 2024’s roster instead represented a series of graduations from opening slots and side stages to top-tier main stage titan status.\n\nFriday featured Lana Del Rey, whose sole previous Coachella performance was at the Outdoor Theatre in 2014. Saturday was capped by Tyler, The Creator appearing for the third time in Indio (his last appearance as runner up to Haim and Beyoncé on the main stage in 2018). And on Sunday, Doja Cat occupied the uppermost spot after her penultimate main stage appearance in 2022.\n\nYet Coachella Weekend 1 this year’s attendees got astronomically more bang for their buck than they counted on, due to a surprise-guest-heavy lineup. The bulk of those special moments came from A-list talent, from Billie Eilish with Lana Del Rey to Olivia Rodrigo with No Doubt, Justin Bieber joining Tems, Kesha with Reneé Rapp, most of the Fugees performing alongside YG Marley, Will Smith performing \"Men in Black\" with J Balvin … the list goes on.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the diversity, quality and impact of the weekend’s performances were tremendous. Even without elite bonus appearances, there were plenty of performances — quite a few of them newcomers, recent buzzbands and imminent breakthroughs — that made this year’s Coachella more than worthy of an early accolade for one of the first-rate fests of 2024. Read on for seven of the best sets from Coachella 2024.\n\nFaye Webster Thrills Loyal Fans With Supreme Confidence\n\nUnderneath the shaded canopy of the Mojave Tent, Faye Webster held her sprawling audience in the palm of her hand during her Coachella debut on Friday. Deafening cheers rang out at the start of every song, which seemed to infuse the 26-year-old singer/songwriter with a level of energy unparalleled up to this point in her career.\n\nWebster deftly worked her way through 11 tracks, each one received with wild cheers from fans, who sang with such gusto that they often nearly overpowered her own vocals. The crossroads of her confidence and creativity fully manifested during closing tune \"Kingston,\" which saw her pausing to let the audience belt out the remainder of the line, a beckoning gesture that exuded self-assuredness.\n\nNotably, three of six new songs (\"Wanna Quit All the Time,\" \"He Loves Me Yeah!\" and \"Lego Ring\") from her recently released fifth album Underdressed at the Symphony were live debuts. The fact that Webster saved them for Coachella showed a clear intention to ensure the set was extra special. Beyond any shadow of doubt, she succeeded.\n\nLana Del Rey Taps Billie Eilish, Jon Batiste & Others For Standout Friday Set\n\nWith her notoriously downtempo demeanor, Lana Del Rey wasn’t the obvious choice for a Friday headlining spot on the main stage, but when all was said and done, her 20-song set delivered plenty to position her as a standout performer.\n\nDressed in an elegant baby blue gown, her entrance — a slow ride on the back of a motorbike through the lanes of the crowd all the way to the stage — worked wonders to build excitement. And her first three song choices, a shortened version of \"Without You\" (not performed since 2014) and two more gems from the vault — \"West Coast\" (debuted 10 years ago to the day at her first Coachella appearance) and her superb cover of Sublime’s \"Doin’ Time\" — signaled her intention to make this show a truly special occasion (neither of the latter two tunes have appeared on a setlist since 2019).\n\nFrom there it was a parade of hits culled from her robust catalog, as the GRAMMY-nominated singer waltzed her way across the expanse of a fairytale palace stage production, at several points venturing up flights of stairs to a towering terrace. Four of her 10 albums feature production from Jack Antonoff (who played with Bleachers on Saturday), so it was unsurprising when he took the helm of the white grand piano toward the end for a strikingly serene duet with a hologram Lana on \"Hope is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have — But I Have It.\"\n\nJon Batiste (who performed his own set on Saturday) also assisted on piano for an alluring take on \"Candy Necklace,\" but the pinnacle moment arrived during performances of \"ocean eyes\" and \"Video Games\" alongside surprise guest Billie Eilish. Sitting side by side atop a balcony, the two harmonized through much of those tracks, and the occasions when Lana sat back to let Billie sing several sections solo were absolutely arresting. The two superstars stared adoringly at each other throughout, clearly just as awe-inspired by the unprecedented collaboration as the audience, which erupted with rapturous applause that rivaled the decibels of the set’s glittering fireworks finale.\n\nRaye Races Toward Superstardom During Emotional Debut\n\nAfter just one song of Raye’s Saturday afternoon performance, there was no question that her Coachella debut would be remembered as one of the most striking in recent years. The British songwriter and chanteuse, who shattered the record for most wins and nominations in a single year at this year’s BRIT Awards, poured every ounce of her soul into her 45-minute set. The crowd inside the Mojave tent hung on every note and went absolutely berserk all the way from the sultry intro of \"The Thrill is Gone\" to gloriously anthemic closer \"Escapism.\"\n\nBacked by a powerhouse band of eight backup singers, three string players, four brass aces and the standard guitar, drums and bass, each song was a showstopper. Without question, the most impactful moment came on \"Ice Cream Man,\" which deals with her own experience with sexual assault and rape.\n\n\"I want you to know it’s not an easy song to sing,\" she started. And before she could continue, the audience released a loud roar of support, to the point that the singer shed tears. When she composed herself, she continued, \"But it’s important to be loud .. and to be brave. This allows me to be loud about something I’ve been quiet about my entire life. I am very f—ing strong.\"\n\nThat moment — which culminated into a big band-style belter that evoked the power of Amy Winehouse and Billie Holiday — likewise drew tears from many in the audience. Further, it defined Raye as an artist destined for superstardom on the merits of genuine talent, an infinitely infectious spirit, and incomparably hard work ethic. To that end, it should be no surprise she’s the songwriter behind tunes from GRAMMY-winning artists including Beyoncé, no big deal.\n\nSublime Revives Their Definitive Sound Alongside Jakob Nowell\n\nThough many were referring to Sublime’s Saturday afternoon appearance on the Coachella main stage as a \"reunion\" in the days leading up to the festival, new frontman Jakob Nowell — son of the band’s deceased original singer Bradley Nowell — made it abundantly clear that wasn’t precisely the case.\n\n\"My name is Jakob Nowell and this is Sublime,\" he said following the conclusion of opening song \"April 29, 1992,\" gesturing toward the beloved Southern California ska-punk band’s surviving members bassist Eric Wilson and drummer Bud Gaugh.\n\nRead more: Sublime's Jakob Nowell On Leading His Father's Legendary Band & What To Expect At Coachella\n\nHis resistance to co-opt his dad’s legacy was admirable, which was an issue for some when Rome Ramirez joined Wilson and Gaugh in 2009 to form Sublime with Rome, a chapter that ended for those original members when Gaugh left the band in 2011 and Wilson subsequently exited in February. With all the pieces in place, the next hour played out as a fantastically fun alliance of old and new.\n\nJakob sounded strikingly like his dad during most moments, though he asserted his own spin on the classic sound by adding a hardcore-esque growl at various points in the set. Among the 14 songs, they revived early-era material that hadn’t been played live since the mid '90s, including \"Date Rape,\" \"Badfish\" and \"Doin’ Time.\" One cut, \"Romeo,\" had not been performed live since 1988. The band likewise included tunes that Bradley never got to perform from the band’s final self-titled album, including some of their biggest commercial successes. Tracks such as \"What I Got\" and \"Santeria\" were sung by thousands, a chorus oozing with celebratory mass catharsis.\n\nBy the end, there could be only one conclusion: the most definitive version of a revived Sublime has arrived and, should they choose to continue on, they’ll be received by fans with open arms.\n\nNo Doubt Snatches Headliner Status During Jubilant Reunion\n\nThough the reunion of No Doubt was billed as the runner-up to Tyler, the Creator’s Saturday night finisher, it’s absolutely valid to argue that the beloved Southern California outfit — playing their first show since 2015 — was the evening’s true headliner. The eye-popping expanse and unerring enthusiasm of the audience (the largest of the weekend), combined with the group’s sheer joy and explosive energy, drove the feeling home.\n\nEvery member of the core group — bassist Tony Kanal, guitarist Tom Dumont, drummer Adrian Young and frontwoman Gwen Stefani — emanated pure exultation, wide grins plastered permanently on their faces. Stefani was especially fired up; after the band powered through five treasured tracks — including opener \"Hella Good\" (performed at the end of long catwalk), \"Ex-Girlfriend,\" and \"Different People\" (featured for the first time since 2009) — the singer stopped to address the sea of screaming fans.\n\n\"Wow … you showed up to Coachella Saturday night 2024 to see No Doubt play together on this stage for the first time in nine years. Are you crazy?!\" Stefani said. \"If I could just somehow explain the amount of love [we feel] and how much I wanna slap the s— out of you guys tonight!\"\n\nThe sentiment was meant endearingly, but every song did hit intensely. In particular, a rendition of \"Bathwater\" featuring special guest Olivia Rodrigo — as hyped as Stefani with her never-ending spinning and bouncing antics — left a lasting mark. For old school fans, the Return to Saturn single was a special treat, and with Rodrigo in the mix, it elicited equal exuberance from younger audience members.\n\nFor the finale of the 16-song setlist, the band fulfilled the promise of euphoric nostalgia with a hard-hitting trio of tracks off 1995 breakthrough third album Tragic Kingdom: \"Just a Girl,\" \"Don’t Speak\" and \"Spiderwebs.\" The timeless tunes incited a sudden surge of fans toward the stage, and one would’ve been hard pressed to spot anyone not participating in the jubilant singalongs. It was a moment of multi-generational unity and unbridled joy — unquestionably unforgettable, and hopefully just the precursor to a triumphant new era of No Doubt.\n\nOlivia Dean Enters the Stateside Festival Scene With Humbling Authenticity\n\nWatching the first few moments of British neo-soul singer Olivia Dean’s Sunday afternoon performance in the Gobi tent, you’d never know this was her first American festival appearance. And what an incredible debut, at one of the States’ most prestigious festivals with only one album under belt (2023’s Messy) to boot. The 25-year-old stunned with utmost finesse and confidence, working the stage like a long-established diva and immediately eliciting rapturous applause after each of the first two songs, \"OK Love You Bye\" and \"Echo.\"\n\nWhile it can sometimes be off-putting when an artist introduces every song with a tidbit explaining what it’s about, this method had the opposite effect for Dean. Her context made each moment feel intensely personal, and the audience reaction was overwhelming. One of many tunes with a distinctly Motown bop, \"The Hardest Part,\" was prefaced with the remark that it \"recently changed [her] life,\" and spoke to the process of overcoming grief. After the final note was sung, she received a deafening standing ovation, prompting her to endearingly cover her face in response. And there was so much power in her anecdote before \"Carmen,\" a tribute to how her grandmother made everything possible for her.\n\n\"My granny came to London when she was 18 … had never been on a plane … left her life behind and had my mom, and my mom had me,\" she said, already being drowned out by cheers before the final remark: \"This song is for my granny and anyone brave enough to move and any immigrant in the crowd right now.\"\n\nAs she wrapped up her short set with the bewitching single \"Dive,\" the sun broke through the clouds, illuminating her with the loveliest natural spotlight to complement a performer who already naturally, effortlessly shines on her own.\n\nDoja Cat Exudes Total Command & Flawless Flow For Sunday Finale\n\nIt cannot be overstated: Doja Cat’s fest-closing performance on the main stage was a visionary masterpiece, and the strongest headlining set of the first weekend. That wasn’t certain from the stripped-down beginning moments when the GRAMMY-winning singer/rapper appeared on a circular b-stage mid-audience, dressed in a hazmat suit and encircled by a black and yellow biohazard pattern.\n\nBut excitement built steadily as she bombastically delivered opening song \"ACKNOWLEDGE ME,\" which, even in an abbreviated format, lived up to its title and created a palpable air of anticipation. From there, she strutted back toward the main stage via a connected catwalk, meeting briefly in the middle with South African quintet the Joy (set to release their self-titled debut album on June 21) offering up fiery raps amidst the group’s arresting a cappella.\n\nShortly after, Doja appeared on the main stage dressed in a knee-length platinum blonde weave, flanked by an army of dancers who all wore matching getups covered in the same synthetic hair. The effect when they all converged, their movements completely in sync, created an optical illusion of one enormous hairy creature moving across the stage to punctuate the ferocity of \"Demons.\"\n\nThat was just the first taste of a breathtaking series of visual sequences over the course of the 70-minute show, each profoundly enhanced by cinematography that created the effect of watching a top-quality music video on the main stage’s massive screens. If you witnessed the camera work during Beyoncé’s Homecoming show back in 2018 or Rosalía’s production in 2023, you’ll understand the aesthetic.\n\nOther key moments when the video work was utterly astonishing arrived during the live debut of \"OKLOSER\" (one of five first-time song features) where the previously smooth camera went rogue, shakily weaving through the gang of dancers to create the effect of maneuvering through a chaotic house party; again during \"Attention\" as the lens wove through dancers in fur coats wielding Cruella de Vil-inspired cabrioles until it settled on Doja at the end of the line; and finally during closing track, \"Wet Vagina,\" where Doja and her dancers rolled and writhed (in perfect choreographed unison) on the b-stage filled with brown mud, the sequel ending in a stunning birds-eye shot.\n\nBacktracking a few moments earlier, maybe the most jaw-dropping production element came on \"WYM Freestyle\" in the form of a giant T-Rex skeleton following Doja down the catwalk while flames erupted from the stage behind her. The precise reason for that wasn’t evident, but it certainly boosted the ferocity of her raw rap delivery.\n\nThe unending visual feast only served to amplify Doja’s already flawless flow. She never missed a vocal mark, whether singing or rapping. She didn’t even once pause to banter with the audience, creating the effect of total focus and command. Big bonuses: 21 Savage materializing mid-set to serve up \"n.h.i.e.,\" Teezo Touchdown’s cameo on \"MASC\" and A$AP Rocky (who likewise performed with Tyler, the Creator on Saturday) swooping in for \"URRRGE!!!!!!!!!!\" before Doja dazzled with super-hit \"Paint the Town Red.\"\n\nWhen all was said and done, Doja Cat more-than-earned her graduation to festival headliner, and while she’s already set for an arena tour this year, she’s clearly destined to stun at stadiums not far in the future.\n\nCoachella 2024 Weekend 1 Recap: 20 Surprises And Special Moments, From Billie Eilish & Lana Del Rey To Olivia Rodrigo With No Doubt"
