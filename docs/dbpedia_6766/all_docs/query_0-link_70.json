        "text": "It isn’t every day that we see what we recognize today as two names in big box office moviemakers from American film collaborating to make a movie. Eleven years ago, this came to pass. J.J. Abrams directed and produced the Steven Spielberg produced movie Super 8 (2011). Abrams wrote the screenplay for what feels to be a nostalgic look back at childhood and place mixed with the feeling of a thriller coupled with monsters.\n\nThe story of Super 8 follows a group of young teenagers in the fictional town of 1979 Lillian, Ohio. Filmed in Weirton, West Virginia and surrounding areas, the group aims to film a homemade movie using super 8 cameras and film available at the time. The group, including Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb, Riley Griffiths as Charles Kaznyk, Ryan Lee as Cary McCarthy and Gabriel Basso as Martin Read, capture a train derailment while filming a movie scene overnight in their fictional Ohio town.\n\nA subtext of the movie includes the mourning of loss that has occurred before the movie has started. For Joe Lamb and his father, police deputy Jack Lamb of the Lillian police force, as portrayed by Kyle Chandler, lost a mother and wife Elizabeth to a workplace accident. Alice Dainard and her father Louis, as portrayed by Elle Fanning and Ron Eldard, respectively, are cast in the awkward position of being linked to that loss for Jack because Elizabeth was working a shift for Louis when Elizabeth died. Jack blames Louis for Elizabeth’s death.\n\nJoe and Alice become emotionally close, despite the above reality and Joe’s coping with the loss of his mother. As the train derailment destroys the location where the teenagers were making their film while also separating them temporarily, they regroup to find their gravely ill biology teacher, Dr. Thomas Woodward in the wreckage. Crates of strange white cubes are found as well, which Woodward warns them to forget and ignore. The kids flee an Air Force convoy, with Colonel Nelec finding an empty super 8 film box in his team’s perusal of the wreckage. Glynn Turman portrayed Dr. Woodward. Noah Emmerich portrayed Colonel Nelec.\n\nA series of weird events commence from here, which includes suspicious behavior by Nemec to the detriment of deputy Jack Lamb professionally and the personal relationship between Jack and his son Joe. The teenagers, meanwhile, engage the help of Charles Kaznyk’s older sister, Jen Kaznyk. The support requested aims to help address the loss of pets, irregularities in electrical service, and other activities that follow the train accident. AJ Michalka portrayed Jen Kaznyk. The story develops from here with plenty of adventure to sustain the interpersonal narratives established with these characters.\n\nThere is much to appreciate and enjoy in the Steven Spielberg style of movie that is Super 8. The focus on childhood experiences and viewpoints reflects the strength of the storytelling. There’s feeling and cleverness whose aim reaches for the likes of E.T. the Extra Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985) or Stand by Me (1986) without necessarily landing on the magic of any of these. The film does feel to me like the most Steven Spielberg movie I’ve seen that was directed by somebody else, which in this case is good. I grant Super 8 as directed by J.J. Abrams 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, January 15, 2021\n\nBritish, American and other expatriates were in Shanghai, China during the time surrounding the Japanese occupation of the city during the Second Sino-Japanese War. That war lasted longer and occurred at the same time that many in the west understand as World War Two, though the film Empire of the Sun (1987) looks at the period that can be roughly understood as 1941 to 1945.\n\n(Christian Bale as Jamie ‘Jim’ Graham and Takatarô Kataoka as Kamikaze Boy Pilot in the film Empire of the Sun).\n\nThe film Empire of the Sun tells the story of spoiled British child Jamie Graham, played by Christian Bale, who starts the film living with his parents in diplomat accommodations in Shanghai prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Jamie has lived an exceptionally privileged life with Chinese servants serving his every wish, having grown up in diplomatic circles in China with an apparent understanding of communicating in both English, the form of Chinese spoken in Shanghai, and Japanese.\n\n(Left to Right, Emily Richard as Mary Graham, Rupert Frazer as John Graham and Christian Bale as Jamie ‘Jim’ Graham in the film Empire of the Sun).\n\nIn the chaos following Japan occupying Shanghai and the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jamie is separated from his parents as the occupation begins. Following some desperate actions in the aftermath of that chaos, Jamie becomes entangled in the occupation with American expatriates Frank Demarest and Basie, as portrayed by John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano.\n\n(John Malkovich as Basie, left, and Joe Pantoliano as Frank Demarest in the film Empire of the Sun).\n\nIn creating a trade network within the camp where the prisoners exist, and in coming of age in a fashion that instills hope among the adult prisoners where all are held, Jamie takes the abbreviated name Jim from Basie and Frank. Hope comes in the form of the successes in acquiring street smarts, flat out bravery in pushing boundaries with his captors for his own good as well as the benefit of the prisoners, and the support Jim acquires through the course of the movie’s telling.\n\n(Nigel Havers as Dr. Rawlins, left, and Christian Bale as Jamie ‘Jim’ Graham in the film Empire of the Sun).\n\nWhile in the camp, Jim also forms a sort of father and son relationship with camp physician and British expatriate Dr. Rawlins, as portrayed by Nigel Havers. The bond formed by the two is palpable and convincing, offering a sweet glimpse into the emotionally possible within the context of the utterly miserable conditions of captivity. It is in part that Jim can maintain an optimism and growth in the face of a military occupation that hope is as strong a message for Empire of the Sun as is captivity.\n\n(Christian Bale and Empire of the Sun director Steven Spielberg on set of the film Empire of the Sun).\n\nThe film Empire of the Sun is based on J.G. Ballard‘s autobiographical novel, also named Empire of the Sun. The film ends during the 1945 liberation of the prison camp, with glimpses of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki catching Jim’s attention. The heavy truths are shared in typically tasteful Steven Spielberg fashion, and the story eventually resolves in emotionally compelling fashions on that larger stage as well as on the personal stage of the relationships forged through the film. Empire of the Sun, rather to my unexpected pleasure, works on an emotional level in the storytelling that allows me to give the film 4.00-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, January 8, 2020\n\nMatt Lynn Digital maintained a strong focus on reviewing movies in 2019. In taking a cinematic look back at the films we reviewed this year, we’ll provide a look into 48 distinct movie. We’ll additionally look into the concept of remakes and sequels as a bonus look into the field of movie making.\n\n(The best movie Matt Lynn Digital saw in 2019 was Vertigo as directed by Alfred Hitchcock. We reviewed this film in April).\n\nAtop our list of movies is the one film that received a perfect rating, that of 5-stars on a scale of 1-to-5 stars on the movie rankings list. Alfred Hitchcock‘s Vertigo (1958) is a film that uses a narrative style mixing in mystery, thriller, romance, and psychological illness to suggest that a character isn’t guilty. Vertigo is the first of two Alfred Hitchcock movies reviewed this year.\n\n(Matt Lynn Digital reviewed 2001: A Space Odyssey as directed, produced and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. We reviewed this film in January).\n\nOur second best film for the year introduced us to space tourism and a future of what traveling in space might look like in Stanley Kubrick‘s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The rating of 4.75-stars reflects the quality in innovation, storytelling, science fiction and genre creation. This is also the first of six movies reviewed this year associated with space travel.\n\n(Three films rated at 4.50-stars included 1980’s Ordinary People, 1992’s Glengarry Glenn Ross and 1998’s Saving Private Ryan. The films were reviewed in January, April and July, respectively).\n\nFour Academy Awards awaited the film Ordinary People (1980), a sad, moving, and emotionally satisfying film. Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) offers the colorful language of full-throated criticism of the modern American business culture. The first of six films produced, directed or both for Steven Spielberg happens to be the first of three films starring Tom Hanks in our review this year. The film Saving Private Ryan (1998) shows a highly realistic depiction of the human cost of war, culminating in the central stories of a group of soldiers tasked with saving one soldier whose brothers died in that same war.\n\n(Three of six films rated at 4.25-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 2019’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, 1999’s The Matrix and 1988’s Big. The films were reviewed in August, May and November, respectively).\n\nThe film Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood (2019) provides a fictional retelling of the time, the place, and an fact-adjacent place of Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s. A winner of four Academy Awards, the film The Matrix (1999) offered a groundbreaking dystopian movie-going experience. The film Big (1988) made a splash with the whimsy of a 13-year-old boy in a grown man’s body.\n\n(The remaining six films rated at 4.25-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 1988’s Rain Man, 1989’s Field of Dreams and 2000’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The films were reviewed in October, June and December, respectively).\n\nAnother winner of four Academy Awards in our reviews this year was the serious yet comedic film Rain Man (1988). The second film, Field of Dreams (1989), while being perhaps the best baseball film ever made is the first of three movies reviewed this year to star Kevin Costner. The film How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) offers an irrepressible portrayal of an aggrieved Grinch who does not care for the holiday of Christmas.\n\n(Four of eight films rated at 4-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 2019’s Joker, 1961’s A Raisin in the Sun, 2016’s Hidden Figures and 1995’s Apollo 13. The films were reviewed in October, June, November and July, respectively).\n\nThe film Joker (2019) tells a gritty, physically demanding, emotional gut punch of an origin story of a would-be foil of the comic book character Batman. A Raisin in the Sun (1961) is a film adaptation that reviews the value and purpose of dreams, the need to fight racial discrimination and the importance of family. The film Hidden Figures (2016) focuses on three African American women fighting society and culture placing the obstacles of indignity, prejudice, and institutional obstruction in their way in service of the space race. The blockbuster film Apollo 13 (1995) tells a triumphant story of human ingenuity and tragedy averted.\n\n(The remaining eight films rated at 4-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 1992’s A Few Good Men, 1993’s The Remains of the Day, 1993’s The Fugitive and 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The films were reviewed in July, February, March and September, respectively).\n\nA Few Good Men (1992) is a film that tells the fictional tale of a Navy lawyer who has never seen the inside of the courtroom while defending two reticent Marines accused of murdering a colleague in Cuba. The film The Remains of the Day (1993) explored how to waste your life emotionally and politically. The preceding two films garnered a dozen Academy Award nominations between the two of them. In the film The Fugitive (1993) you see the story of a man unjustly accused of murdering his wife who gains his freedom through a train accident then sets to establish his innocence. In Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), a partially live action and animated film offers an adult sensibility filled with lurid details, gags of a lighter nature, and an all around good time.\n\n(Four of fourteen films rated at 3.75-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 2019’s Motherless Brooklyn, 2019’s Knives Out, 2017’s The Darkest Hour and 2012’s Looper. The films were reviewed in November, December, April and June, respectively).\n\nThe film Motherless Brooklyn (2019) sets itself against the backdrop of 1950s New York City with a puzzle for lead character and private detective with Tourette’s Syndrome. Knives Out (2019) as a whodunnit works for not being based on anything. The film The Darkest Hour (2017) follows the trying days of the Dunkirk Evacuation with Operation Dynamo. Rian Johnson, with his second film in this paragraph in Looper (2012), gets creative with two characters battling each other through time in an interesting science fiction plot.\n\n(Four of fourteen films rated at 3.75-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 1999’s October Sky, 2018’s Ready Player One, 2010’s Inception and 2018’s Widows. The films were reviewed in May, February, January and September, respectively).\n\nThe film October Sky (1999) tells the tale of a difficult father son relationship and the formation of a career in the early days of the space race. The science fiction, fantasy, and action film Ready Player One (2018) offers clever mixes of graphic and reality set in the hypothetical year 2045. Winning four Academy Awards, the film Inception (2010) offers a decent science fiction story line with an entertaining if dreamy cinematic experience that works well in movie or home theaters alike. The film Widows (2018) offers political intrigue, a corrupt local crime boss, and a broken relationship between a husband and wife that gives this story some punch.\n\n(Six of fourteen films rated at 3.75-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 1988’s Bull Durham, 1986’s Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, 1983’s Terms of Endearment, 1982’s Poltergeist, 1977’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 1954’s White Christmas. The films were reviewed in October, August, February, August, June and December, respectively).\n\nThe film Bull Durham (1988) is the film of a rookie, a veteran, an experienced fan seeking a love triangle and baseball. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986) tells a comedic high school version of the message stop and smell the flowers. Winning five Academy Awards, the film Terms of Endearment (1983) tells of the family problems of an independently spirited daughter and her hard to please mother. The original film Poltergeist (1982) gains momentum as random occurrences in the home begin to introduce themselves and grow into outright disturbances that scare the audience. An alien-themed film with a lyrical bent gives a glimpse into the wonder that is the move Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). White Christmas (1954) is the romantic movie for Christmas that quite honestly inspired the genre.\n\n(Four of ten films rated at 3.50-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 1996’s Fargo, 1998’s Fallen, 1985’s The Color Purple and 1941’s Dumbo. The films were reviewed in February, March, March and March, respectively).\n\nFargo (1996) won an Academy Award for screenplay written for the screen while playing in the genres of crime, drama, and possibly thriller. Most correctly, the film should be characterized as a dark comedy in small town America. The film Fallen (1998) mixes the genres of supernatural with police thriller in tackling a clever telling of aiming to defeat the supernatural. The film adaptation of The Color Purple (1985) could have been harder hitting in getting into some of the upbringing and forcibly separate lives of sisters Celie Johnson and Nettie Harris. Brutal truths in the lives of the sisters are explored nonetheless with dignity. The fifth movie released by Disney was the animated film Dumbo (1941). The 64-minute feature gets into the story of a baby elephant forced to work in order to survive.\n\n(Three of ten films rated at 3.50-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 1963’s The Birds, 1990’s Arachnophobia and 2018’s Brian Banks. The films were reviewed in May, June and August, respectively).\n\nThe sudden and unpredictable attacks of birds form the premise of the Alfred Hitchcock film The Birds (1963). Arachnophobia (1990) just might be the film for you have a fear originating in childhood that you’d like to have comically challenged for two hours. The film Brian Banks (2018) recounts much of the story of a man sent to jail unjustly in what appears to be a clear case of injustice.\n\n(Three of ten films rated at 3.50-stars by Matt Lynn Digital included 2019’s The Secret Life of Pets 2, 2019’s Gemini Man and 2010’s The Town. The films were reviewed in July, October and December, respectively).\n\nThe Secret Life of Pets 2 (2019) is an animated film that follows the lives of pets in an apartment in New York City as pet owners leave for the day with the added mixture of a circus, a farm, and an airplane flight. The film Gemini Man (2019) deserved better than the box office gate the film received in theaters. The Town (2010) offered a film looking into the notion of burglary, armored trucks, banks, and Fenway Park serving as places just as distinctly as there were funny notions of love and loyalty.\n\nMovies landing with a rating of 3.25-stars included The Jackal (1997) reviewed in May, The Running Man (1987) reviewed in August, The Mule (2018) reviewed in August, Welcome to Marwen (2018) reviewed in September and Ad Astra (2019) reviewed in October.\n\nAddressing the theory of remaking movies or offering sequels that keep a franchise going, we offered why this can work to assist storytelling and cinema in a look we made in March. We looked into A Star is Born (1937), A Star Is Born (1954), A Star Is Born (1976) and A Star is Born (2018). We looked into The Wizard of Oz (1939) and The Wiz (1978). Then there were Little Orphan Annie (1932), Annie (1982), Annie (1999) and Annie (2014). The films The Godfather (1972) led to sequels The Godfather: Part II (1974) and The Godfather: Part III (1990). Batman Begins (2005) led to The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). The film Jaws (1975) led to three sequels, namely Jaws 2 (1978), Jaws 3-D (1983), and Jaws: The Revenge (1987).\n\nWe finally offered our Top 20 Movies in ranked order (with reviews) in April. I recommend taking a closer look, as there are movies that we didn’t specifically review in 2019 that are worth your time. 2019 was a good year for reviews with us. Invite your friends to follow us if you agree.\n\nMatt – Tuesday, December 31, 2019\n\nIt was the middle of a three-film collaboration between Robert Zemeckis and Christopher Lloyd that started with Back To The Future (1985) that a combination live-action and animated adventure comedy hit the movie theaters. That film, largely marrying cartoons from the Warner Brothers and Disney Company houses, asked one simple question that became the movie name. The question? Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)?\n\n(Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant with the animated Roger Rabbit in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit).\n\nThe leading man in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit is Eddie Valiant, the alcoholic detective with a story as played by Bob Hoskins. The film itself is set in 1947 in an era before the advent of the Interstate Highway System, a fact that becomes central to the plot of the film. Before learning how, we come to learn that Eddie has an unfavorable attitude towards the cartoons who inhabit the world of this film. In Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the cartoons have lives outside their films, shows, or shorts.\n\n(Joanna Cassidy as Dolores in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit).\n\nWe learn through Eddie’s love interest, Dolores, that Eddie’s brother died at the hands of a cartoon when a cartoon, acting of his own accord, killed Eddie’s brother by dropping a piano upon the two Valiant brothers. Eddie was fortunate in that he escaped the piano incident with a broken arm; conversely, he became the alcoholic who couldn’t keep his life together owing to the grief over losing his brother.\n\n(Alan Tilvern as R.K. Maroon in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit).\n\nWe learn some of an animosity that exists for Eddie and cartoons slightly after Eddie arranges with R.K. Maroon of the Maroon Cartoons to take compromising pictures of the wife of animated bunny Roger Rabbit, one wife of animated yet voluptuously drawn human Jessica Rabbit. To get things right monetarily with Dolores, Eddie has agreed to take compromising pictures of Jessica Rabbit. Eddie Valiant gets pictures of Jessica playing a literal game patty-cake with Marvin Acme of the Acme Corporation, Acme cartoons and Toontown.\n\n(Stubby Kaye as Marvin Acme with the animated Jessica Rabbit in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit).\n\nA right complete adventure follows one day after Roger Rabbit learns of the patty-cake pictures and responds in a betrayed manner to the notion that Jessica possibly would have been unfaithful. A complication that ensues the pictures makes Roger look guilty, which brings about the question of Roger’s guilt and if he had been framed. Roger enlists Eddie Valiant’s support in exonerating him. In the process, Judge Doom becomes established as a counterpoint to Roger, Eddie, Dolores and those interested in Roger getting a fair chance to acquit himself of the charges in addition to reclaiming his love.\n\n(Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit).\n\nJudge Doom has introduced a brew of toxic chemicals capable of killing any cartoon. Doom’s “Dip” universally scares all cartoons, whereas mundane things like falling refrigerators simply bring about confusion, circling birds, circling bells or circling stars. Dip in action is shown to have a deadly outcome for cartoons. Eventually, Eddie Valiant braves Marvin Acme’s Toontown while taking a charming step that either saves or fails to save the day. Being the smart guy without spoilers that I am, how things work out is one thing I will leave for you as encouragement to watch the film.\n\n(Robert Zemeckis, pictured here with an animated version of Roger Rabbit, directed the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit).\n\nI appreciated the combined efforts of director Robert Zemeckis and live action actor Christopher Lloyd in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. That the plot playfully offers an adult sensibility in a PG-13 makes this film not appropriate for all children, including those who might appreciate cartoons or films like Toy Story (1995), Frozen (2013), or cartoons from Hanna-Barbera. These three are partly examples of cartoons that came to exist after the film, or whom were not included in the cartoons represented in the film.\n\nOverall, my grade for Who Framed Roger Rabbit belies the appreciation of a film well-crafted and a story well-executed. Kathleen Turner as the voice of Jessica Rabbit with Charles Fleischer as the voice of Roger Rabbit also worked for me. I rate Who Framed Roger Rabbit at 4.00-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, September 18, 2019"
