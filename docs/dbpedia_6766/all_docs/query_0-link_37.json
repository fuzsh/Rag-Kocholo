This unlicensed, makeshift bar nestled in her backyard is the opposite of everything annoying about today’s party scene. There are rules at Abby’s: no cell phones (not even to “look something up”), earning a seat at the bar takes time and losing a challenge means drinking a limey, sugary “not-beer” drink. As the oddball cast of regulars will tell you, hanging out at Abby’s is a coveted honor. But once you’re in, you’re family. “Abby’s” is a multi-cam filmed outside in front of a live audience.\n\nTHE ENEMY WITHIN (NBC DRAMA)\n\nStars: Jennifer Carpenter, Morris Chestnut, Raza Jaffrey and Kelli Garner.\n\nExecutive producers: Ken Woodruff will write and executive produce.
