        "text": "Sabrina Carpenter is the first to admit that it's taken her a bit of time to find her way to the top of the music industry. She even likens herself to the tortoise in the fable \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" — even if she didn't want to believe the metaphor growing up.\n\n\"Something that my mom always said to me as a little girl that really annoyed me was that I am the tortoise… throughout my life, [I was] being told, 'Sabrina, you're the tortoise, just chill,'\" Carpenter recalled while accepting the Variety Hitmakers Rising Artist Award in December 2023. \"In moments of frustration and confusion it can feel like a letdown, but it turns out it's actually a very good thing.\"\n\nIt's been a very good thing for Carpenter, indeed. A decade since the release of her debut single, the singer/songwriter isn't just breaking through — she's one of pop's new reigning queens. Over the last year, Carpenter has nabbed her first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, made a stellar debut at Coachella, and performed on \"Saturday Night Live,\" all the while racking up billions of streams on her music new and old. It's all built excitement for one of the most anticipated pop albums of the summer: Short n' Sweet.\n\nAs Carpenter unveils her new album, take a deep dive into her decade-long journey to pop stardom.\n\nGetting Started: Disney Breakthrough\n\nGrowing up, Carpenter filled the sounds of her family home in Pennsylvania with covers of songs like Adele's \"Set Fire To The Rain\" and \"Picture to Burn\" by future Eras Tour companion Taylor Swift (more on that later). After submitting videos for a singing contest spearheaded by Miley Cyrus, Carpenter would get her first taste of success. Placing third, she caught the eye of Hollywood Records, who signed her following the competition.\n\nSimultaneously, Carpenter also began pursuing acting, landing guest spots on series like \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" in 2011 and joining \"The Goodwin Games\" in 2012. In 2014, she landed a lead role in the Disney Channel series \"Girl Meets World,\" a spin-off of the beloved '90s series \"Boy Meets World,\" which served as a breakthrough moment for the burgeoning star — and a catalyst for her music career.\n\nJust before the show debuted, Carpenter released her debut single, \"Can't Blame A Girl for Trying,\" the title track to her debut EP that arrived a month later. While the four-track EP was the typical output of a teenage Disney star — bubblegum pop sounds with digestible, family-friendly lyricism — it showed off her youthful timbre and offered themes that would become prevalent later in Carpenter's songwriting: love, heartache, and navigating life.\n\nA year later, she released her debut album, Eyes Wide Open. A mix of pop with folk and country influences — a soundscape that remains on Short n' Sweet — Carpenter's debut showed maturity and growth following Can't Blame A Girl For Trying; songs like \"Eyes Wide Open\" and \"We'll Be the Stars\" showed a more introspective side, reflecting on the pressures of being in the spotlight and the journey of finding her identity. Eyes Wide Open also hinted that Carpenter was beginning to hone her songwriting skills, penning four of the 12 tracks.\n\nIt would be on her 2016 sophomore album, EVOLution, where Carpenter would find confidence as a songwriter, co-writing all but one song on the 10-track project. In turn, the lyrics reflected her growing sense of self and a new perspective on past themes, like embracing non-romantic forms of love in \"All We Have is Love,\" being there for a struggling friend in \"Shadows,\" and learning to assert boundaries in \"Space.\"\n\nEVOLution transitioned Carpenter out of the teen pop aesthetic into a more sophisticated sound, experimenting with dance-pop and techno sonics. Genre versatility would become a throughline of sorts for Carpenter, and EVOLution foreshadowed the multifaceted musicality that was to come.\n\nShedding Disney: From Child Actor To Pop Star\n\nAfter \"Girl Meets World\" came to an end at the beginning of 2017, Carpenter was ready for reinvention. Much like Britney Spears' Britney and Cyrus' Can't Be Tamed before her, as Carpenter grew into an adult, she felt like she needed to shed the Disney-fied image that has become a rite of passage for teen stars. Thus began the Singular era.\n\nReleased in 2018 and 2019, respectively, Singular: Act I and Singular: Act II featured songs that were more risqué and mature in nature. A far cry from her tamer work of the past, the R&B track \"Hold Tight\" is equal parts sultry and evocative with Carpenter singing, \"Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in right/ Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine.\"\n\nAs she noted in an interview with Billboard, Singular: Act I was a natural progression for a girl now in her late teens — even if it was against the squeaky-clean image of her beginnings.\n\n\"I was known as a fictional character on television with lines that were written for her with an attitude that was portrayed in a way by other people. So for a lot of people, their first impression of me was as a 13-year-old girl [singing] the kinds of songs that she should be singing,\" she said. \"Then, flash forward to 19, and people are asking why I am not singing about the same things that I did when I was 13, as if that's normal.\"\n\nOne of the more notable Singular tracks is from Act I, \"Sue Me.\" Sneakily disguised as a story about a romantic relationship, the song is Carpenter's response to being sued by her ex music managers: \"That's my shape, I made the shadow/ That's my name, don't wear it out though/ Feelin' myself can't be illegal.\" Its tongue-in-cheek and snarky nature would inevitably embolden Carpenter to continue writing more confessional songs with attitude, whether she's responding to media scrutiny in \"because i liked a boy\" from 2022's emails i can't send, or warning a suitor to be careful in Short n' Sweet's \"Please, Please, Please.\"\n\nSingular: Act I and Act II further helped demonstrate different facets of Carpenter's musicality, with the former leaning into pop tendencies and the latter embracing an R&B flair. And as her final albums with Hollywood Records, she used Singular: Act I and Act II to indicate that she wasn't going to let any sort of previous perceptions hold her back. Their coming-of-age themes showcased Carpenter as an artist coming into her own — regardless of whether listeners wanted to keep her in the Disney box or not.\n\nReintroducing Herself: Artistic Authenticity & The \"Nonsense\" Effect\n\nWhile the world was going through a period of change amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so was Carpenter. She signed with Universal Music Group's Island Records in 2021, and soon she would be able to fully introduce the world to who Sabrina Carpenter is as an artist.\n\nAs she noted herself to Variety earlier this year, her 2022 LP, emails i can't send, \"marked the beginning of a really freeing and artistic time for me.\" Once again, she co-wrote every song on the album; this time, though, she only had one co-writer for each track, and even wrote two songs solo (\"emails i can't send\" and \"how many things\") — proving that she was more assured as a songwriter than ever.\n\nAs a result, Carpenter's knack for confessional songwriting is on full display. emails i can't send represents a reflective time capsule of sorts; one that brings the curiosity of her earlier work with the perspective and wisdom of a young adult. Her growing fame meant there was more attention on her personal life, and emails i can't send allowed her to reclaim her narrative and express her side of the story.\n\nCarpenter's candidness struck a chord with listeners, and upon the release of emails i can't send in July 2022, it was clear Carpenter was on a new trajectory. The album debuted at No. 23 on the Billboard 200, which marked her highest entry on the chart to date (as of press time); the 2022 stretch of her Emails I Can't Send Tour sold out in less than a day. And once \"Nonsense\" was released as a single that November, her place as a rapidly rising star was solidified.\n\n\"Nonsense\" was initially written as a means to an end after Carpenter was writing a sad song and had writer's block. Now, the track is the epitome of Carpenter's lyricism, weaving together her wit and humor with an infectious hook. First gaining traction on TikTok because of its catchiness, it's become a beloved part of Carpenter's canon thanks to her inventive and bespoke outros during her live shows. It's since become a tradition for fans to check to see what outro she created for each performance, adding to the fan fervor.\n\nCarpenter further satiated fans' taste for her cheeky lyricism in March 2023, when she released emails i can't send fwd:, the deluxe version of her album, which featured a new track called \"Feather.\" She took the playful, flirting energy of \"Nonsense\" and infused \"Feather\" with buoyant, airy production that mimics the feeling of self-liberation after moving on from a relationship. Earning Carpenter her first pop radio No. 1, \"Feather\" proved that the singer's audacious style was taking hold — and it set the stage for an even bigger 2024.\n\nBecoming A Superstar: Eras Tour, \"Espresso\" & Beyond\n\nAfter her own extensive — and very sold out — tour in support of Emails I Can't Send, Carpenter's rising star status was further confirmed by pop's current queen, Taylor Swift. The singer earned a coveted opening slot on Swift's monumental Eras Tour in Mexico, South America, Australia, and Asia.\n\nJust after her last Eras Tour show in March 2024, Carpenter hinted that her own new era was beginning. \"I'm starting to feel like I've outgrown the songs I'm singing,\" she admitted to Cosmopolitan, \"which is always an exciting feeling because I think that means the next chapter is right around the corner.\"\n\nThat chapter began with \"Espresso,\" which dropped a day before her debut Coachella performance. Doubling down on the playful, self-assured vibe of \"Nonsense,\" the song immediately hinted that big things were coming for Carpenter, debuting at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 3.\n\nUpon announcing her sixth album, Short n' Sweet, Carpenter released \"Please Please Please.\" Combining her now-signature playful, carefree lyricism with an airy, disco-tinged sound, \"Please Please Please\" didn't just present Carpenter as a confident superstar — it became her first Hot 100-topping smash.\n\nCarpenter has referred to Short n' Sweet as the \"hot older sister\" of emails i can't send. \"It's my second 'big girl' album; it's a companion but it's not the same,\" she explained to Variety, to whom she also admitted she feels a \"sense of separation\" from her work prior to emails. \"When it comes to having full creative control and being a full-fledged adult, I would consider this a sophomore album.\"\n\nIt's apt, then, that her Short n' Sweet collaborators — including songwriters Julia Michaels, Amy Allen and Steph Jones — are largely the same as the team from emails i can't send. \"I've really honed in on the people that I love making music with,\" she told Rolling Stone in June.\n\nEven more telling of the direction she's heading is her work with one of pop's hottest producers — and Swift's right-hand man — Jack Antonoff, for the first time. At a GRAMMY Museum event with Antonoff himself, Carpenter debuted the country-infused \"Slim Pickins,\" presenting yet another pop style from Short n' Sweet. And as \"Slim Pickins,\" \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please\" indicate, Carpenter's knack for infectious and edgy lyrics isn't just the throughline across Short n' Sweet — it's become the epitome of both her artistry and her stardom.\n\nJust like her metaphorical friend the tortoise, Carpenter's long but steady journey has clearly paid off. As she's figured out who she is on her own terms, she's manifested the bonafide superstardom she's always imagined.\n\n\"I never had the plan B, and it wasn't even a thought in my mind that it wouldn't work out,\" she told Rolling Stone. \"I just always knew it was about not if it would happen but when it would happen.\"\n\nFor Carpenter, every chapter of her artistry has built on the last; she's refused to rest on her laurels and continuously pursued new directions. She's creating work that wholeheartedly reflects her, and growing a loyal fan base because of it. Her next album might be named Short n' Sweet, but her time as a pop superstar will be anything but.\n\nAll Things Sabrina Carpenter\n\nSince its inception in 2019, Afro Nation has brought together the world's best and brightest entertainers in Afrobeats, amapiano, R&B, and hip-hop to perform on stages across the world. For the second year in a row, the festival takes over Bedrock's Douglass Site in Detroit — promising to continue its tradition of highlighting the best in Black music.\n\nWith its unique Detroit location, the festival bridges the gap between African music, global Black music, and the rich musical traditions that came out of Motown. In fact, the festival's site was once home to the first federally funded housing project for Black citizens in the city; Diana Ross and Smokey Robinson were among its residents.\n\nAfro Nation Detroit offers as much history as it does global appeal, as its lineup is filled with buzzy rising stars and beloved veteran acts. Among those on the star-studded roster are Nigerian sensations Omah Lay, Rema and Asake, amapiano stars Kelvin Momo and TxC, and hitmakers Lil Wayne and PartyNextDoor.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a Detroit event without native rapper Kash Doll, who performs on Saturday. And she won't be the only Detroiter performing over the weekend: genre-bending soul singer Charity and DJ Donavan Glover will also be repping their city amid sounds from around the globe.\n\nThat's just a taste of the exciting performances scheduled to showcase the diversity of Black music in one of its influential cities. Below, get to know eight acts who you won't want to miss at the second edition of Afro Nation Detroit.\n\nAyra Starr\n\nSat., Aug. 17 (Lit Stage)\n\nAt the age of 22, Ayra Starr is already making history. In February, The Beninese-Nigerian singer was the youngest nominee in the inaugural Best African Music Performance Category at the 2024 GRAMMYs; and in June, her debut album, The Year I Turned 21 helped her become the first female Nigerian artist to debut on the Billboard 200 album chart.\n\nJust before her Afro Nation appearance, Starr added another first to her resume: she became the first Afrobeats singer to be part of Amazon Music's Breakthrough Artist program. The honor aligned with the release of her Amazon Music documentary, Dare to Dream, which chronicles her rise to global fame. There's no doubt that Ayra Starr will offer a showstopping performance that proves why she's such an acclaimed artist to watch.\n\nUncle Waffles\n\nSat., Aug. 17 (Piano People Stage)\n\nOften regarded as the \"princess of amapiano,\" Uncle Waffles is one of the genre's most forward-facing talents. In less than five years, the internationally recognized DJ/producer has been listed on TikTok's inaugural Visionary Voices Africa List, been nominated at the BET Awards and MOBO Awards; this year, she became the first amapiano artist to perform at Coachella.\n\nHer talents have also earned Uncle Waffles co-sign from Beyoncé — whose Renaissance World Tour homage to Uncle Waffles' \"Tanzania\" nearly brought the star to tears — Drake, Ciara, and Missy Elliott. Needless to say, Uncle Waffles is an act that you won't want to miss at AfroNation Detroit.\n\nRead More: 11 Women Pushing Amapiano To Global Heights: Uncle Waffles, Nkosazana Daughter, & More\n\n2woBunnies\n\nSat., Aug. 17 (Piano People Stage)\n\nThink Daft Punk, but amapiano. Masked South African DJ duo 2woBunnies decided on the concept of anonymity as a way to create intrigue about their unique take on the genre, and let their music do the rest.\n\nThough it has only been two years since their debut, they have done just that, from garnering more than 1 million likes on TikTok to performing sets everywhere from Dubai to Australia. Following first-time performances in major cities like Paris and Toronto, they'll make their Detroit debut next — and you don't want to miss the excitement they'll bring to Afro Nation.\n\nKizz Daniel\n\nSat., Aug. 17 (Lit Stage)\n\nSince releasing his breakout single, \"Woju,\" in 2015, Kizz Daniel has been a trailblazer in bringing Afrobeats to the world. And nearly 10 years in, he's continuing to deliver songs that resonate — including a hit remix of \"Twe Twe\" with fellow Nigerian star Davido.\n\nKizz Daniel's Afro Nation performance comes on the heels of another fiery remix, as he recently hopped on Nigerian artist Kaestyle's \"My Dealer.\" He'll have plenty of new songs from his own catalog to bring to his set, too, including his latest single, \"Double,” and EP TZA. Whether new or old, Kizz Daniel will be ready to give his crowd a lesson in Afrobeats.\n\nShenseea\n\nSun., Aug. 18 (Lit Stage)\n\nIn May, Shenseea released her sophomore studio album, Never Gets Late Here, which solidified the GRAMMY nominee as one of Jamaica's most promising rising stars. \"Hit & Run\", the album's single, was warmly received throughout the Caribbean, reaching No. 1 on several charts across Antigua and Barbuda, Turks and Caicos, Bermuda, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and many other countries in the region.\n\nFittingly, Shenseea first brought Never Gets Late Here to life on stages across the Caribbean, where her onstage energy matched the hyped crowds. She stops by Afro Nation Detroit just after kicking off her Never Gets Late Here North American Tour in Chicago on Aug. 16, so she'll surely be ready to show festgoers why she's so beloved in her home country and beyond.\n\nAmaarae\n\nSun., Aug. 18 (Lit Stage)\n\nTo say Amaarae is in demand would be an understatement. Sabrina Carpenter personally requested the Ghanaian American artist as an opening act for her forthcoming tour; Childish Gambino featured her on his new album, Bando Stone & the New World, and its accompanying tour; and she recently made history as the first Ghanaian artist to perform on NPR's Tiny Desk.\n\nHer latest release, roses are red, tears are blue — A Fountain Baby Extended Play, are equal parts Afropop and alté, a fusion genre that originated in West Africa and combines hip-hop, R&B and Afrobeats. Her sweet, alluring nature signifies her place as one of the most exciting new talents to take over pop. Don't miss the opportunity to see a new global pop girl take center stage.\n\nScorpion Kings\n\nSun., Aug. 18 (Piano People Stage)\n\nDJ Maphorisa and Kabza De Small — often referred to as the \"godfathers\" of amapiano — are the men behind Scorpion Kings. Already established in their own right and respected in South Africa's dance scene, the two have been inextricably linked to the global rise of the genre, and the celebration of South African and African music across the globe.\n\nLast month, the pair performed alongside the who's who in amapiano — Kelvin Momo, Oskido, DJ Tunez, DJ Moma, Aquite, and the Descendants — in Central Park, making history as the first amapiano performance in the famed New York landmark. The duo is sure to keep the party going with their signature flair in Detroit.\n\nDJ Moma\n\nSun., Aug. 18 (Piano People Stage)\n\nThere is a good chance that you know of DJ Moma. In addition to being one of the founding members of Everyday People, the Sudanese American DJ has been playing African music in venues throughout the country and world for over a decade.\n\nHis blend of African and Diasporic music, and incorporation of soca, amapiano, and dancehall are a celebration of everything that is global Black music. It is more than music to him, but a way to bring Diasporic musical traditions to the forefront, in an effort to connect and unify People of the African Diaspora across the globe. His mission will make for an Afro Nation Detroit moment that is as meaningful as it is joyful — a combination that's exactly what the fest is all about.\n\nMore News About African Music\n\nWith massive crowds and countless critics raving about her debut album, Ravyn Lenae knew what she had to do: completely ignore all of the expectations that led to it.\n\n\"I knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go,\"she says from her home in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter building up a growing following in Chicago alongside other members of the Zero Fatigue Collective (which includes producer Monte Booker and rapper Smino), Lenae relocated to the West Coast. She made a massive mark on 2022’s Hypnos, which featured a beguiling mix of alt R&B, house and soul alongside Renae’s magnetic vocal presence.\n\nAnd rather than coast, Lenae dug deeper for the followup, Bird’s Eye (due Aug. 9). Working with frequent Kendrick Lamar collaborator and in-demand producer DJ Dahi, Bird’s Eye flutters across genres and influences — pulling from Fleetwood Mac on one track, drawing in Childish Gambino on another, and adding Jimmy Jam’s bass elsewhere. Indicative of these multifarious influences are two pre-release singles: the retro pop-leaning \"Love Me Not\" and the soulfully skipping \"Love Is Blind.\"\n\nLenae uses that shapeshifting methodology as a way to interrogate the concepts of love and relationships — never content to rest on her laurels, learning how best to grow and adapt. \"Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity,\" she says.\n\nNearing the release of Bird’s Eye, Lenae spoke with GRAMMY.com about directing the video for \"Love Me Not\" in Chicago, blending Brazilian music with Prince inflections, and how the album helped her reconnect with her father.\n\nA lot seems to have happened in the two years since 'Hypnos.' On a month-to-month, day-to-day basis, how much do you shift creatively?\n\nIt feels like night and day to me, even though it's been a really short amount of time. During this time between Hypnos and this album — the recording and creating process — a lot unlocked with me. [There was] a lot of personal growth that happened that allows me to approach music in a much freer and kind of impulsive way.\n\nWith the last album and that process, I think I did place a lot of parameters around what I had to be, what I had to sound like, what it had to feel like, who I had to connect with. And I kind of just released all of those expectations with this and made music that I wanted to hear.\n\nHow easy was it to actually release those boundaries and work more more in the moment?\n\nI knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go, if I wanted to keep pursuing music in a way that felt honest. And then being able to collaborate with people such as Dahi, who has kind of mastered that in a lot of ways, and learning from him and seeing his process, seeing how easy and natural it is to just fall into what feels right…\n\nI think the longer you're in an industry or you're in something, the more rules you place on [creativity] and the more you overthink it and try to mold it in a way that doesn't feel impactful. As an artist, being around him and him encouraging that type of process, I think that was a lot of it, too.\n\nDahi's worked with some incredible artists, and clearly in a way that accentuates that artist rather than making it about DJ Dahi. That must have been so perfectly aligned with your openness, to go in and let yourself learn what you wanted to do. They always say if you know too much and plan everything out, you’ll end up stifled creatively.\n\nIt's so true. And that's why I describe it as me kind of returning back to that 12-year-old me, that 13-year-old me, before I cared about opinions, what people thought about me and what I was doing, what I was wearing I think we start off that way, and then the older we get, the more we get so self-conscious and we judge ourselves more harshly than everyone else.\n\nWhy do we do that?!\n\n[Laughs.] I think it's just human nature. And then we try to unlearn all of it.\n\nEven just in daily life, it's so hard to not think about what I could have done at any given moment. And when you’re creating music, there are 5 million ways you can create the same idea and you have to just land on that one.\n\nA hundred percent. During this process, we would have a song idea and then three different versions of that song that hit completely different feelings — maybe a more soft rock version of it, maybe a more indie version of it, maybe a more soulful version. Then it was about having to settle into what is \"the one\" and what feels the best, versus like what's going to chart or what's going to get in the club. Having to release all of that and just really lean into what feels good is what works every time.\n\nThat relates even to how the album was announced, with two tracks that almost speak in conversation with one another. Those songs balance such clever hooks with more nuanced conversation about how conflicted and complex love and relationships can be. How did you find that balance between emotional realism and such immediate music?\n\nIt was just really feeling empowered and confident in my decision making. And that's something that's developed over time, too. Really listening to my voice and what I want out of music in my career and my rollout, you know?\n\nListening to that, obviously having people around me who are like-minded in that way like my management and my team. We all kind of empowered each other to lean into those feelings. At no point in this process did anything feel forced or like I was reaching for something.\n\nThat’s so interesting. You want your team to feel supportive but you also want to feel empowered to take risks away from that support. And that reminds me of “Love Me Not,” which has some really smart risks. It's that vintage pop feeling, right down to the clap-along beats, and the vocals feel right in your ear. So when you started working on that track, for example, did you always imagine it being that nostalgia, that warmth?\n\nI thought that there was just something so cool and timeless, a classic feeling about it. And my songs are the ones where you can really pinpoint what the influences are, or when this was made, or the person behind it. Having a song like that, that really reminded me of Outkast. Like, What is this?\n\nEven before it dropped, I remember having some anxiety around maybe my fans not liking it because it feels a little different from Hypnos. I think anytime you kind of jump outside of the bubble you've kind of created, it's scary because there are people living in that bubble with you who like the temperature in there.\n\nIt’s so important to be constantly revitalized in your work. If you’re doing the same thing, even if your fans are demanding it, you’re not going to get that. And hopefully when your fans see all that you can do, they’ll follow it.\n\nYeah. And there's so much left in me to explore into and put out into the world. And look at an artist's career, someone like Tyler, the Creator: Seeing where his sound started and how he's almost trained his fans’ ears to be receptive to something new every time. They've completely grown up with him in a lot of ways and expanded their palate. Kind of forcing the hand of listeners is something that's really interesting to me. [Laughs.]\n\nI love that idea of pushing yourself and pushing your fans, but still within the realm of what's good. [Laughs] Not just experimenting for the sake of it. Speaking of growing and experimenting, I wanted to ask about the “Love Me Not” music video that you directed. It feels so well shot but still so intimate and casual.\n\nI knew with the album and how I wanted the imagery to feel, it would be very homey. Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity, those first moments where I felt like I was getting closer to myself in a way.\n\nA lot of that started on the South side of Chicago, at my grandmother's house, in the basement. Even the cover of the album symbolizes that transition for me. That's where I dyed my hair red for the first time in the basement, in the sink, so coming back to the sink and dyeing my hair ginger on the cover was something that felt so powerful and defining for me. It just made perfect sense that we were going to go back to Chicago for the first video, in my grandmother's house, with all my family members involved. Those are my grandparents, my mom, my sisters, so that's why it feels so loose and candid. I really wanted to give people a glimpse into my life and what it felt like walking into my childhood home.\n\nGetting to see a place through someone else’s eyes is so extraordinary. It really makes the little details pop. For example, the plantains cooking on the stove at the beginning.\n\nYeah. I associate plantains with my grandparents, my family. We’re of Panamanian West Indian descent, so those smells and those sounds, I really wanted to incorporate into the video.\n\nThat really speaks to bringing some comfort along with the risk-taking, same as having your family around. The features do a great job of bolstering you, setting up that stability, particularly Ty Dolla $ign on \"Dreamgirl.\"\n\nI think we just had the idea to kind of take the song into a different world in a way. When we first started the first section of the song, I just knew there was magic there. Those Prince drums and that Brazilian guitar — why do those make sense together? It shouldn't ever make sense together. But when I heard it? Oh my god, this feels like something fresh and new, but also like I've felt this feeling before.\n\nDahi's brain is just incredible, and then even bringing in Jimmy Jam on it to do bass was a dream come true. I knew it kind of felt like it existed in that Janet stratosphere, and I thought it would be such a cool touch for him to do that personally. Dream come true on all spectrums. I love Ty Dolla $ign, obviously grew up listening to him. He's incredible and I was so honored that he wanted to do it.\n\nBesides Janet, were there any particular artists who were kind of central inspirations for this album specifically?\n\nSonically, Janet is always in the mix. With this one in particular, some Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, a little bit of Fleetwood Mac in there. I just love taking these worlds that are very different from each other and kind of mashing them and seeing what happens. It's like my favorite thing ever.\n\nYou’re trained in classical music, and it's so clear that you understand the range of emotion that you can convey. I'm just curious what happened when you went into recording — or even before that, in the writing. What was it like digging into yourself to find the narrative that matched the mashing?\n\nHonestly, I don't think there was much premeditation with the writing and what I wanted to touch on in a way. Really leaning into those impulsive initial first feelings that a song gives me is something I really valued with this album. And moving forward, that'll be my process.\n\nWhat was premeditated with the writing process with this album was, with every song, trying to really peel back those layers in my brain and those barriers lyrically. Like, What would I naturally say? Think of that and then think, Okay, how can I make this even more literal, even more personal? Even in working with my girl [songwriter] Sarah Aarons, I learned a lot from her as far as songwriting and how to really paint a picture that feels clear and concise and emotional. Not trying to find the prettiest words or the most interesting words, but really writing what feels real. And that's something that I've really, really valued and learned with this process.\n\nEven with “One Wish” with Childish Gambino, the whole album feels like this big conversation on relationships. Being more direct feels like some advice someone would get with a relationship itself, let alone writing about it. Did that process help you actually process what was happening in your life too?\n\nOh man, 100 percent. And that's why music is so beautiful to me. It's really a means of opening dialogue between me and myself, and then me and the people in my life. With a song that's so important to me like “One Wish,\" it’s not just because it's a great song, but because this has really catapulted me into this different part of my life and repairing relationships, opening up difficult conversations — like with my father in particular. Hearing such a simple song and the response I've gotten from it has only validated me much more in the fact that these real stories, real emotions are what connects.\n\nHave you played the album for your father?\n\nWe started repairing or rekindling our relationship maybe two years ago. The making of Bird’s Eye was at its peak and I felt like it was important for me to have a song on the album that addressed my relationship with him in order for me to release it and start to move on in a positive way.\n\nSo sharing the song with him, inviting him to be in the music video was huge for us. And then even after debriefing about maybe some feelings that came up when he heard certain lyrics or when he saw certain scenes in the video, it just opened up this really honest, candid dialogue between us and I couldn't be more grateful that I have this outlet.\n\nMore R&B News\n\nIn the pantheon of rock guitar gods, Slash ranks high on the list of legends. Many fans have passionately discussed his work — but if you ask him how he views his evolution over the last four decades, he doesn't offer a detailed analysis.\n\n\"As a person, I live very much in the moment, not too far in the past and not very far in the future either,\" Slash asserts. \"So it's hard for me to really look at everything I'm doing in the bigger scheme of things.\"\n\nWhile his latest endeavor — his new studio album, Orgy Of The Damned — may seem different to many who know him as the shredding guitarist in Guns N' Roses, Slash's Snakepit, Velvet Revolver, and his four albums with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators, it's a prime example of his living-in-the-moment ethos. And, perhaps most importantly to Slash, it goes back to what has always been at the heart of his playing: the blues.\n\nOrgy Of The Damned strips back much of the heavier side of his playing for a 12-track homage to the songs and artists that have long inspired him. And he recruited several of his rock cohorts — the likes of AC/DC's Brian Johnson, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Gary Clark Jr., Iggy Pop, Beth Hart, and Dorothy, among others — to jam on vintage blues tunes with him, from \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" to \"Born Under A Bad Sign.\"\n\nBut don't be skeptical of his current venture — there's plenty of fire in these interpretations; they just have a different energy than his harder rocking material. The album also includes one new Slash original, the majestic instrumental \"Metal Chestnut,\" a nice showcase for his tastefully melodic and expressive playing.\n\nThe initial seed for the project was planted with the guitarist's late '90s group Slash's Blues Ball, which jammed on genre classics. Those live, spontaneous collaborations appealed to him, so when he had a small open window to get something done recently, he jumped at the chance to finally make a full-on blues album.\n\nReleased May 17, Orgy Of The Damned serves as an authentic bridge from his musical roots to his many hard rock endeavors. It also sees a full-circle moment: two Blues Ball bandmates, bassist Johnny Griparic and keyboardist Teddy Andreadis, helped lay down the basic tracks. Further seizing on his blues exploration, Slash will be headlining his own touring blues festival called S.E.R.P.E.N.T. in July and August, with support acts including the Warren Haynes Band, Keb' Mo', ZZ Ward, and Eric Gales.\n\nPart of what has kept Slash's career so intriguing is the diversity he embraces. While many heavy rockers stay in their lane, Slash has always traveled down other roads. And though most of his Orgy Of The Damned guests are more in his world, he's collaborated with the likes of Michael Jackson, Carole King and Ray Charles — further proof that he's one of rock's genre-bending greats.\n\nBelow, Slash discusses some of the most memorable collabs from Orgy Of The Damned, as well as from his wide-spanning career.\n\nI was just listening to \"Living For The City,\" which is my favorite track on the album.\n\nWow, that's awesome. That was the track that I knew was going to be the most left of center for the average person, but that was my favorite song when [Stevie Wonder's 1973 album] Innervisions came out when I was, like, 9 years old. I loved that song. This record's origins go back to a blues band that I put together back in the '90s.\n\nSlash's Blues Ball.\n\nRight. We used to play \"Superstition,\" that Stevie Wonder song. I did not want to record that [for Orgy Of The Damned], but I still wanted to do a Stevie Wonder song. So it gave me the opportunity to do \"Living For The City,\" which is probably the most complicated of all the songs to learn. I thought we did a pretty good job, and Tash [Neal] sang it great. I'm glad you dig it because you're probably the first person that's actually singled that song out.\n\nWith the Blues Ball, you performed Hoyt Axton's \"The Pusher\" and Robert Johnson's \"Crossroads,\" and they surface here. Isn't it amazing it took this long to record a collection like this?\n\n[Blues Ball] was a fun thrown-together thing that we did when I [was in, I] guess you call it, a transitional period. I'd left Guns N' Roses [in 1996], and it was right before I put together a second incarnation of Snakepit.\n\nI'd been doing a lot of jamming with a lot of blues guys. I'd known Teddy [Andreadis] for a while and been jamming with him at The Baked Potato for years prior to this. So during this period, I got together with Ted and Johnny [Griparic], and we started with this Blues Ball thing. We started touring around the country with it, and then even made it to Europe. It was just fun.\n\nThen Snakepit happened, and then Velvet Revolver. These were more or less serious bands that I was involved in. Blues Ball was really just for the fun of it, so it didn't really take precedence. But all these years later, I was on tour with Guns N' Roses, and we had a three-week break or whatever it was. I thought, I want to make that f—ing record now.\n\nIt had been stewing in the back of my mind subconsciously. So I called Teddy and Johnny, and I said, Hey, let's go in the studio and just put together a set and go and record it. We got an old set list from 1998, picked some songs from an app, picked some other songs that I've always wanted to do that I haven't gotten a chance to do.\n\nThen I had the idea of getting Tash Neal involved, because this guy is just an amazing singer/guitar player that I had worked with in a blues thing a couple years prior to that. So we had the nucleus of this band.\n\nThen I thought, Let's bring in a bunch of guest singers to do this. I don't want to try to do a traditional blues record, because I think that's going to just sound corny. So I definitely wanted this to be more eclectic than that, and more of, like, Slash's take on these certain songs, as opposed to it being, like, \"blues.\" It was very off-the-cuff and very loose.\n\nIt's refreshing to hear Brian Johnson singing in his lower register on \"Killing Floor\" like he did in the '70s with Geordie, before he got into AC/DC. Were you expecting him to sound like that?\n\nYou know, I didn't know what he was gonna sing it like. He was so enthusiastic about doing a Howlin' Wolf cover.\n\nI think he was one of the first calls that I made, and it was really encouraging the way that he reacted to the idea of the song. So I went to a studio in Florida. We'd already recorded all the music, and he just fell into it in that register.\n\nI think he was more or less trying to keep it in the same feel and in the same sort of tone as the original, which was great. I always say this — because it happened for like two seconds, he sang a bit in the upper register — but it definitely sounded like AC/DC doing a cover of Howlin' Wolf. We're not AC/DC, but he felt more comfortable doing it in the register that Howlin' Wolf did. I just thought it sounded really great.\n\nYou chose to have Demi Lovato sing \"Papa Was A Rolling Stone.\" Why did you pick her?\n\nWe used to do \"Papa Was A Rolling Stone\" back in Snakepit, actually, and Johnny played bass. We had this guy named Rod Jackson, who was the singer, and he was incredible. He did a great f—ing interpretation of the Temptations singing it.\n\nWhen it came to doing it for this record, I wanted to have something different, and the idea of having a young girl's voice telling the story of talking to her mom to find out about her infamous late father, just made sense to me. And Demi was the first person that I thought of. She's got such a great, soulful voice, but it's also got a certain kind of youth to it.\n\nWhen I told her about it, she reacted like Brian did: \"Wow, I would love to do that.\" There's some deeper meaning about the song to her and her personal life or her experience. We went to the studio, and she just belted it out. It was a lot of fun to do it with her, with that kind of zeal.\n\nYou collaborate with Chris Stapleton on Fleetwood Mac's \"Oh Well\" by Peter Green. I'm assuming the original version of that song inspired \"Double Talkin' Jive\" by GN'R?\n\nIt did not, but now that you mention it, because of the classical interlude thing at the end... Is that what you're talking about? I never thought about it.\n\nI mean the overall vibe of the song.\n\n\"Oh Well\" was a song that I didn't hear until I was about 12 years old. It was on KMET, a local radio station in LA. I didn't even know there was a Fleetwood Mac before Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. I always loved that song, and I think it probably had a big influence on me without me even really realizing it. So no, it didn't have a direct influence on \"Double Talkin' Jive,\" but I get it now that you bring it up.\n\nWas there something new that you learned in making this album? Were your collaborators surprised by their own performances?\n\nI think Gary Clark is just this really f—ing wonderful guitar player. When I got \"Crossroads,\" the idea originally was \"Crossroads Blues,\" which is the original Robert Johnson version. And I called Gary and said, \"Would you want to play with me on this thing?\"\n\nHe and I only just met, so I didn't know what his response was going to be. But apparently, he was a big Guns N' Roses fan — I get the idea, anyway. We changed it to the Cream version just because I needed to have something that was a little bit more upbeat. So when we got together and played, we solo-ed it off each other.\n\nWhen I listen back to it, his playing is just so f—ing smooth, natural, and tasty. There was a lot of that going on throughout the making of the whole record — acclimating to the song and to the feel of it, just in the moment.\n\nI think that's all an accumulation of stuff that I've learned over the years. The record probably would be way different if I did it 20 years ago, so I don't know what that evolution is. But it does exist. The growth thing — God help us if you don't have it.\n\nYou've collaborated with a lot of people over the years — Michael Jackson, Carole King, Lemmy, B.B. King, Fergie. Were there any particular moments that were daunting or really challenging? And was there any collaboration that produced something you didn't expect?\n\nAll those are a great example of the growth thing, because that's how you really grow as a musician. Learning how to adapt to playing with other people, and playing with people who are better than you — that really helps you blossom as a player.\n\nPlaying with Carole King [in 1993] was a really educational experience because she taught me a lot about something that I thought that I did naturally, but she helped me to fine tune it, which was soloing within the context of the song. [It was] really just a couple of words that she said to me during this take that stuck with me. I can't remember exactly what they were, but it was something having to do with making room for the vocal. It was really in passing, but it was important knowledge.\n\nThe session that really was the hardest one that I ever did was [when] I was working with Ray Charles before he passed away. I played on his \"God Bless America [Again]\" record [on 2002's Ray Charles Sings for America], just doing my thing. It was no big deal. But he asked me to play some standards for the biopic on him [2004's Ray], and he thought that I could just sit in with his band playing all these Ray Charles standards.\n\nThat was something that they gave me the chord charts for, and it was over my head. It was all these chord changes. I wasn't familiar with the music, and most of it was either a jazz or bebop kind of a thing, and it wasn't my natural feel.\n\nI remember taking the chord charts home, those kinds you get in a f—ing songbook. They're all kinds of versions of chords that wouldn't be the version that you would play.\n\nThat was one of those really tough sessions that I really learned when I got in over my head with something. But a lot of the other ones I fall into more naturally because I have a feel for it.\n\nThat's how those marriages happen in the first place — you have this common interest of a song, so you just feel comfortable doing it because it's in your wheelhouse, even though it's a different kind of music than what everybody's familiar with you doing. You find that you can play and be yourself in a lot of different styles. Some are a little bit challenging, but it's fun.\n\nAre there any people you'd like to collaborate with? Or any styles of music you'd like to explore?\n\nWhen you say styles, I don't really have a wish list for that. Things just happen. I was just working with this composer, Bear McCreary. We did a song on this epic record that's basically a soundtrack for this whole graphic novel thing, and the compositions are very intense. He's very particular about feel, and about the way each one of these parts has to be played, and so on. That was a little bit challenging. We're going to go do it live at some point coming up.\n\nThere's people that I would love to play with, but it's really not like that. It's just whatever opportunities present themselves. It's not like there's a lot of forethought as to who you get to play with, or seeking people out. Except for when you're doing a record where you have people come in and sing on your record, and you have to call them up and beg and plead — \"Will you come and do this?\"\n\nBut I always say Stevie Wonder. I think everybody would like to play with Stevie Wonder at some point.\n\nIncubus On Revisiting Morning View & Finding Rejuvenation By Looking To The Past"
