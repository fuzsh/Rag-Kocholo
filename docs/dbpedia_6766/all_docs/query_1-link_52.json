It’s no secret how gorgeous this girl is, but can we take a minute (or more) to appreciate the beauty of this gem?!\n\nSpeaking on her TV show, Schooled, AJ opened up about the plot and how it’s been a “long process” for her. “I have been a part of The Goldbergs for the past six years, and I have really gotten to love Lainey and develop her from the ground up. I feel very close to that character. And people have really come to love my relationship with Barry on that show,” she said.\n\nShe continued, “We kind of ended up closing that chapter, and here we are 10 years later. Lainey is working at her old high school as a music teacher. We are now in the 90s, so I’m able to spin off this character who is now an adult. It had a lot of different lives, it was not going to go, and now they’ve retold it.”\n\nAs for her and her sister Aly’s inspiration behind their iconic bop Potential Breakup Song? “A lot of it is electronic pop, 80s inspired, and less guitar than we have usually done. While we were making it, we were listening to Tame Impala, Beach House, Genesis, and Peter Gabriel’s solo stuff, bands that have inspired us in a really cool way,” she said.\n\nAJ also opened up about the advice she’d give to her younger self; something I think we can all related too. “Continue to trust yourself. You are what you are for a reason, and that’s exactly what you’re supposed to be.”\n\nAJ and her sister will be hitting the road starting THIS week for their summer tour, so be sure to click here for deets! You can also now order some kick-ass new merch from the new era from the girls here."
