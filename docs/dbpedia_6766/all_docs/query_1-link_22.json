        "text": "This is actually the second time the show has tried to make a spinoff. Wondering how that is possible? Formerly known as “Schooled”, the first spinoff was ordered February of last year but was not picked up to become a series. Therefore, ABC made it a special episode which was released early this year. The episode’s ratings proved that a potential spinoff could become a success. The spinoff has since been retooled, cast AJ as one of its stars, and is now becoming a 13-episode series!\n\nAJ was a series regular on “The Goldbergs” in Seasons 3 and 4 and has had a recurring role since. Moving on to the '90s will definitely show us how the lives of Lainey, Mr. Glascott, and Coach Mellor have changed over the years. Let’s hope some of the original cast can make cameos so we can see where they have ended up!\n\nThe spinoff is being written by Marc Firek, one of the current executive producers of \"The Goldbergs\", and will be based on a story by him and “The Goldbergs” creator and executive producer, Adam F. Goldberg. They want to make this spinoff more of a workplace comedy in Philadelphia.\n\nWe are currently seeing a lot of success from spin-offs and revivals like “Roseanne” and “Young Sheldon”. We can’t wait to learn more about the “The Goldbergs” spinoff and what it will be about! As for now, make sure to watch “The Goldbergs” Season 5 Wednesdays at 8pm on ABC!\n\n(Image via Corey Nickols/Getty Images)\n\n- Diego Pineda, YH Contributing Writer"
