        "text": "The sisters' careers Aly e AJ Michalka began on the Disney Channel and continued in various successful TV series including Phil From the Future, Six Feet Under e General Hospital. In 2005 they launched their musical career as Aly & AJ with the album Into The Rushwhich went gold in the United States thanks in part to the single No Oneincluded in the soundtrack of the Disney film Ice Princess - A dream on ice. After two albums, a collection and several chart-topping singles, the duo went on hiatus in 2007 to pursue their film careers and returned to the stage in 2013 with the EP Ten Years. More than an album, a touch of the beat gets you up on your feet gets you out and then into the sun is a true rebirth. Preceded by the release of the single Listen!!! last January, the new album takes its title from one of the tracks that captures the essence of this work: it is a blend of an unbreakable bond between two sisters, the energy of the West Coast, and their innate sensitivity in telling a timeless story.\n\nCategories: A, J"
