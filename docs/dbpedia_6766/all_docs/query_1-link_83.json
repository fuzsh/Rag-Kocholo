        "text": "I'm sure that when the Revelation and the Dreamworks reboot of She-Ra were announced, countless people were thrilled. So many wanted to focus on the battle between He-Man and Skeletor and, likewise, She-Ra and Hordak. And you know what? I think we got that. When it comes to the villains, Hamil knocked it out of the park with his tribute to Filmation era and Canon films Langela Skeletor, and nobody could have brought the tragic figure of Hordak in the reboot like Keston John,\n\nBUT, what I think many were not expecting were the \"secondary villains\" to steal the shows.\n\nLena Headey found a way to bring Lyn to life in the best possible way. She was able to capture the maniacal and scene-chewing side of Skeletor's assistant sorceress, and there was never a second were you couldn't believe you were later seeing an abused partner who was slowly getting worse due to the inescapable trauma her boss inflicted upon her. And every last line, every last shift to emotion, every last scene where the person behind the mic needed to convince you they were actually there? Headey didn't put anything less than her A-Game in it for a single millisecond.\n\nAnd likewise, same thing with AJ Michalka's Catra. Sure, she could also be a conniving, scheming, arch-enemy of the Princess of Power who loved embracing her evil-side, but she could also be a troubled and lost child who knew that the call to good was something she needed to look into. Cursed by the abuse she suffered at the hands of her power-hungry mother figure, Michalka played Catra to perfection (or as close as you can get to it). Despite Catra being put into countless different scenarios which required her to switch to vastly different emotions countlessly, Michalka was able to convince everybody that this was all the same person. And it was a vital part in making her character work so well.\n\nIn particular, I think the best showcase of Headey's performance as Lyn is her monologue about the sad state of the universe when she's fighting Teela in the final episode. And Michalka? I'd say Catra's monologue when she says she has nothing more to loose to the patrons of the Crimson Waste tavern in the beginning of season two.\n\nSmith gave us a sorceress who was transforming into a larger than life Master of the Universe as she found her own independent life while finally being able to see all of existence, and Stevenson gave us the tale of a tragic figure turned hero who realized she didn't have to follow in the footsteps of her abusive mother. And they didn't just find the right people to play them. They found the best possible actresses to bring them all to life."
