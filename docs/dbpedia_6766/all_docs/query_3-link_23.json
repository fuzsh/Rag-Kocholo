        "text": "Aly and AJ Michalka landed in Berlin last September with a single film camera, one crew member (Aly’s husband, Stephen Ringer), a handful of outfits, and only a vague idea of the city’s geography. They had just 72 hours to shoot the music video for their new single, “Attack of Panic,” out February 7.\n\nAs they crisscrossed the city in boots and pleather pants, choosing different locations—an underground subway station, a cobblestone square, a backlit bar—to perform loose modern-style choreography, they attracted little knots of curious Berliners (“People were like, ‘Who are these American weirdos?’” AJ joked) and raced to get the shots they needed before the sun went down, or their camera lens fogged up in the sudden warmth of a club, or they were kicked out altogether.\n\nMeanwhile, AJ was reading scripts for the show she stars in, ABC’s Schooled, from 5,780 miles away, on the phone to producers in Los Angeles at 2 a.m. Berlin time. “We literally sat at Paris bar and [she was] breaking down,” Aly recalled. To put it mildly, AJ added, “Nothing about our experience there was relaxed.”\n\nLuckily, it all fit the theme. “Attack of Panic” was inspired by a conversation Aly had with the father of a friend whose first language is Italian, and who was describing the paroxysms of fear and anxiety that had begun to seize him later in life. The Italian-to-English translation flipped the traditional phrase, “panic attack,” in a way Aly, 30, found compelling. “It’s literally an attack of panic. It attacks your senses. It attacks your entire being.”\n\n“The idea of panic setting in is really, really visceral for Aly and I,” added AJ, 28, who at one point in her life experienced periodic panic attacks that left her “absolutely wiped out.” “Chaos is so relevant right now,” she said, “especially as young women in our 20s and 30s figuring out where we want to go in life, who we want to be, how we’re looked at.”\n\nWhen it comes to the lens of public perception, Aly and AJ are experts. The two grew up as tween stars, Aly on Disney Channel’s Phil of the Future and Now You See It… and AJ joining her in Cow Belles, which saw them gain notoriety as a sister duo. They established their musical act in 2004, and released their debut record, Into the Rush, the following year under the Disney-owned Hollywood Records. (From personal experience, “Rush” and “Chemicals React,” both off that album, stir up some heavy millennial nostalgia.) Two more albums followed, the third featuring “Potential Breakup Song,” in 2007, which really took them into the stratosphere. Then came a split with their record label, the tabling of various projects, and a relative departure from music altogether.\n\nThe sisters ramped things back up in 2017 with the release of their Ten Years EP—“Promises” is a personal favorite, moody and insistent—and followed up with another EP, Sanctuary. Those songs hinted at a dancier Aly & AJ, a little darker, a little older. Their fan base has evolved too, to include a huge swath of the LGBTQ community—people who were closeted in the early and mid-aughts when they first heard Aly & AJ, but are out now, and feeling the sisters’ new sound. They’ve embraced that too, raising more than $60,000 for the Trevor Project on their most recent tour. As they grow out of the child-star molds that defined them early on, the sisters are exploring topics like depression, anxiety, and introspection with increasing transparency, conscious of their ability to inspire conversations around topics once considered taboo.\n\nLike the subject matter, the music video for “Attack of Panic” is darker than the sisters’ previous work. It cuts from shots of Aly and AJ on a city bus looking frazzled and exhausted (hello, Monday morning commute) to them standing, rigid, in a hotel lobby channeling the twins from The Shining, to them pacing dark alleyways and subway stations in the aforementioned pleather and boots, to them moving restlessly around a hotel room, taking turns staring hypnotically into the camera lens.\n\nShooting on film gives the video a grainy quality that feels heavier than digital might. Parts are half-lit or backlit, and other parts are overlaid with a red wash that recalls the mindfuck final scene in 2018’s Suspiria (also, coincidentally, set in Berlin). Their voices float in the background, airy and spooky in a minor key, set against a deep techno beat. A clamoring synthesizer comes in at the chorus, a little like church bells, but in Mordor. It feels, roughly, like a panic attack.\n\nThe Suspiria and Shining interpretations are mine, but “Attack of Panic” does have cinematic roots. Just before writing it, Aly and AJ watched 1986’s Labyrinth for the first time back-to-back with Return to Oz, which was made the year prior. AJ describes both movies as “bizarre, psychedelic,” Aly as “terrifying,” but both were in awe of the “weird ’80s electronic” scores. While they and their collaborators—CJ Baran and Ben Romans, whom they met backstage at a Carly Rae Jepsen concert—wrote “Attack of Panic,” they played scenes from Labyrinth on loop in the background, hoping that the song’s production would “hold up to a montage of Jennifer Connelly running around a party and David Bowie trying to chase her,” AJ said. “And it did.” Both sisters urged me to play the ball scene from Labyrinth on mute, with “Attack of Panic” running over the top. I did, and my brain exploded. The two synced up perfectly.\n\nBalancing acting and music careers means that much of the sisters’ songwriting is infused with the same cinematic quality—“like a soundtrack to life,” as AJ put it. It also means that they are exacting about their schedules behind the scenes, planning minutely to coordinate television shoots, studio time, and tours. Now that they’re back in the thick of things, Aly and AJ are hyperaware of the momentum it takes to stay viable in the streaming era, and the balance inherent to keeping both old and new fans excited and engaged. “It’s like being an author who started out writing nursery rhymes, and now you’re writing futuristic novels,” AJ said. “How do you depart from that without banishing the fans who love the nursery rhymes?”\n\nThe answer, at least for them, is to take extra care with how they package releases, and to make sure each new song feels genuine to its core. “Attack of Panic” will be paired with another song, “Joan of Arc on the Dance Floor,” which Aly describes as more “triumphant.” The dichotomy is deliberate, designed to give fans a snippet of a club-style Aly & AJ they can gyrate to while applying eyeliner in their underwear (you know, hypothetically), and to build up their appetite for a full-length album, scheduled to be released later this year. The process of continually releasing music, Aly said, can be angst-inducing; it can be tempting to overwork songs, to never let them go. “It’s scary. It’s like someone is saying, ‘We’re going to take the baby back and weigh it’ and you’re like, ‘I’m not ready yet.’ It helps that AJ and I have each other. At least one of us will be like, ‘Dude, stop. We’re moving on now.’”\n\nWith each new drop, a different facet of the duo comes to the forefront—a new hint of their range and depth. But, they said, they feel like they’re still in the process of establishing themselves. “I do feel we still have to prove who we are and mark our territory a little bit,” AJ said. Part of that, noted Aly, is offering something holistic: “Our goal as artists is not just to sell records and gain notoriety. It’s a much deeper experience. When people come to an Aly & AJ show, they should come out feeling revived, like they matter. It should feel like a sanctuary.”"
