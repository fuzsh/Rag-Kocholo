Aly and AJ have joined TikTok, posting one featuring their best song.\n\n@alyandaj\n\nit took too long, it took too long, it took too long for us to Tik Tok #potentialbreakup #potentialbreakupsong #alyandaj #newalbumcomingsoon\n\n♬ Potential Breakup Song - Aly & AJ\n\nI don't really know why the green screen is a moon. But I don't care. I also don't care that their lip-synching is ever so slightly off; it's their first TikTok after all and it's a great one.\n\nWhat I do care about is what is written below.\n\nYes, extremely clever and relevant caption. But also, NEW ALBUM COMING SOON.\n\nCan't wait for more TikToks from Aly and AJ and new music to save me from this dark, dark world.\n\nPBUS 4EVER.\n\nShare This Article"
