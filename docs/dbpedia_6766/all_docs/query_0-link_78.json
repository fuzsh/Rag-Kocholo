        "text": "It was always a dream of mine to get engaged at a concert where I was engulfed in music that I loved, with the person that I love. Although my proposal happened another way for me, one Syracuse University grad did just that for the love of his life in a very special way.\n\nAccording to Syracuse.com, SU alum Quentin Brunson popped the question to his girlfriend of seven years during Adele's television concert that aired on television Sunday night.\n\nBrunson graduated with a master’s in social work from Syracuse University in 2013, worked as a CSTEP coordinator at Le Moyne College, and currently serves as site director for Communities In Schools of Los Angeles. But how exactly did he get the opportunity?\n\nHe had to work for it. He submitted a one minute video explaining why he wanted the chance to propose on stage.\n\n“I felt like this opportunity was from God for sure because it was made for us,” he said. “Once it came across my table and I saw it, I just knew that if I submit to this, they’re going to pick us because, I don’t know, we have so much to offer. And I’m just happy that everything went the way it did.”\n\nThey were selected and that's when the planning began. Brunson's now fiancee, Ashleigh Mann, was under the impression they were celebrating her newest accomplishment in her catering career.\n\nThe couple was brought on stage, but Mann had no idea where she was. In fact, Adele even had to speak to the audience to tell them to maintain composure.\n\n“He blindfolded her — bit kinky, but you know — and he’s given her noise-canceling headphones... she has absolutely no idea where she is or where she’s going, so I need every single person to be really bloody quiet,” Adele told the crowd. “If you make a noise, I’m going to kill you.”\n\nHe then gets down on one knee after leading her through the crowd at Los Angeles' Griffith Park and exchanging some sweet words. Watch below for yourself.\n\nDid you tear up? Because we sure did.\n\nWould you like to get engaged with the help of Adele? Or really, any other famous person that is? Let us know inside our station app."
