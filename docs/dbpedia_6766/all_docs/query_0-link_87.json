        "text": "Study of Threes\n\nLists of Twos\n\n(The Study of Threes)\n\nhttp://threesology.org\n\nDuring a research of the \"threes phenomena\", other patterns come to be viewed, regardless of how we may react to them... whether as a thorn in one's side, a confirmation of some consideration, or as an anomaly. One of these patterns is a grouping-of-two, though words such as pairs, couple (coupling), opposites, contrasts, (mirror) image, reflection, twin, twain, two-some, 'something and something else', counter-part, \"significant other\" (one's spouse), this or that, you and I/me and you, etc., might be used in accordance with the language of a given subject area or context of appearance.\n\nPatterns-of-two do not offer an exception to the \"three\", but are a part of a \"Rule -of- Three\" in terms of a Singularity - Duality - Plurality context... with the most predominant plurality being a pattern-of-three. It's as if all of humanity is experiencing a 'cognitive limit' as did primitives of long ago whose counting sequences had, in their own language equivalent way, a word for the quantity 'One', a word for the quantity 'Two', and anything beyond this they had a word such as \"Many\", though we of today might well include other words such as much, more, other, etc... One of these alternative listings is the word \"family\". The word \"family\" means \"many\" when we cite the usage of a single person, a couple, and beyond these two would be a \"family\", as defined as a basic father - mother - child complex. We do not use an alternative word to designate the addition of other children. And, it can be noted that we use the phrase \"extended family\" to denote an even larger group of members who are considered to be closely associated. It is similar to the usage of \"large\" in that we do not have another word, but instead resort to a type of 1,2,3 recount by way of using X-large, XX-large, XXX-large. These examples are expressing cognitive limits. The human brain is using a very primitive and repetitive architecture. Despite all the words we might use, they do not conceal the primivity of thought processing taking place. The may be the result of some brain-maturational effect, and/or environmental (etc.) which keeps us locked into this brain echo, exercise, hang-up, babbling sequence, undulation, reverberation, cadence, or whatever you want to call it.\n\nNo doubt it was very strange long ago for someone to use a word such as \"three\" to designate a specific quantity when all others were using a word such as \"Many\", even though they reserved the usage of the word \"Many\" to represent a quantity of four or more. As time went on and specific words were developed for the quantities up to ten, we find that the quantity \"eleven\" was initially referred to as one and ten. While we of today use the words \"eleven\" and \"twelve\" instead of \"one and ten\", and \"two and ten\", the word \"thirteen\" and the other \"teens\" show remnants of the older counting system. The \"thir\" can either refer to third or three, with the \"teen\" being a reference to \"ten\". Hence, we find three and ten, four and ten, five and ten, etc... At the value of \"twenty\", the composite of \"two and ten\" might well be indistinguishable to some readers whose minds do not permit them to readily animate linguistic variations over large expanses of time. In other words, the ability to decipher some instances of modern usage from older forms takes a bit of imagination in order to break the \"code\" into an understandable translation.\n\nInterestingly, in terms of American Democracy being defined in a general way by a usage of a \"separation of powers\"/\"checks and balances\" provision in the structure of a three-branch government... it is a cognitive limit. The usage of a word such as \"Cenocracy\" as a value inclusive of and yet expanded from this convention will no doubt be looked upon as queerly by some as did the usage of a word which designated a specific value of three in an early counting sequence as was mentioned previously. In other words, it is the beginning of a transition away from the old cognitive limit being used by the tripartite structure. It does not do away with the old system, per sey, it enhances it through a significant alteration. The term \"Cenocracy\" refers to a new way of counting Equality. It is a new cognitive mathematics that established systems will adapt to, just as are Americans who are being slowly transitioned into the usage of the metric system. A new social self- governance system is slowing making its way into the social mindset. The landscape of politics will change dramatically in the years to come because of different standard of equality being practiced.\n\nWith respect to the \"two\", one might also encounter instances of a prefix such as \"bi\" as in bicycle or \"di\" being used as in a dimer chemical compound. Of course there are other references concerning some two-patterned grouping that could be used, and those using them may not necessarily be conscious of their usage of such. We should also point out that if we were to include the example of \"pairing\" with respect to couples, the list would be in the millions, since most people only \"pair\" with one other person; not to mention that most births amongst animals involve either the generation of a male or female and not a mixture thereof. Most people are monogamous, in that they have only one mate... even though some may have multiple partners, such partnerships typically occur after another partner has or will eventually be totally replaced by another 'one'.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that in some instances, historians tend to exclude someone whose presence and accompanying actions were no doubt an integral contribution such as in the case of the Wright Brothers' sister and in the case of DNA, though Watson and Crick were initially given sole credit for the discovery of the design:\n\nIn the case of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson; while we might refute the contribution of Holmes' housekeeper Mrs. Hudson as a dominant third entity, it is difficult to exclude the recurring contributions (whether good or bad) that were made by Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard. And since I am not intimately familiar with all the following \"twos\" examples, I can not speak on the possible existence of other \"overlooked\" three-patterns. In other words, patterns can often be found if we look for them with a particular mind-set in hand. Like different pieces of string encountered over a short or long period of time, it all depends on if our intent is to join them together into a ball of string, throw them away, or separate them according to some created formula for a proposed independent or collective usage.\n\nThe first example is a list of \"twos\" called pairs from the Wikipedia and some other associated two-patterned grouping lists. After-which I include a short list of what has been referred to as Persistent Dichotomies being taught and identified in psychology courses... but, interestingly, it is not being contrasted with the presence of Persistent Trichotomies, or its philosophical/psychological implications of mental growth and brain maturation that impact all other subject areas as well. While multiple \"threes\" examples have been noted by others, conclusions or at least considerations thereof have resorted to explanations based on superstition, religion, or some other antiquated supposition. While there is a preponderance of evidence to suggest otherwise, additional ideas are not routinely considered. However, one idea that has been offered which differs from those of the traditional past, is that the recurrence of \"threes\" (to which we might well add \"twos\"), is the notion of cultural predispositions... yet why there are such predispositions is not also being explored in reference to changes in preference either due to the culture itself or another culture's imposition, such as in the case of America's influence on cultures which are forced to except a continuing Military occupation and thus a persistent exposure to an American \"threes enumerated\" mindset.\n\nNote: some of the information at the bottom of the page is duplicated on other pages at this site and at Cenocracy.org in the Female Leadership section.\n\nWikipedia: List of mythological pairs See also: Wikipedia: A List of \"pairs' listings Mythological Pairs\n\nAltair and Vega (couple from Chinese mythology)\n\nAmphion and Zethus (twins)\n\nApollo and Artemis (twins)\n\nBalin and Balan (siblings)\n\nCastor & Pollux (astronomical; juxtapositions); also (twins) The twin stars in\n\nGemini; see also Dioscuri; see also Leda and the Swan\n\nDamon & Pythias (companions)\n\nDavid and Goliath (opponents)\n\nDeucalion and Pyrrha (couple)\n\nDiarmuid and Gráinne (couple)\n\nHagbard and Signy (the Romeo and Juliet of the Vikings)\n\nThe Dioscuri (twins; rivals/opponents)\n\nHero and Leander (couple)\n\nHansel & Gretel (siblings)\n\nHun-apu and Ixbalanque (twins)\n\nIzanami and Izanagi (couple)\n\nIxchel and Itzamna (lovers)\n\nKaliyan & Kalicchi (First couple in Kali Yukam, as per Akilam)\n\nSampooranathevan & Paradevathai (couple as per Akilam)\n\nLancelot & Guinevere (couple)\n\nLucifer & Diana (Stregheria; couple)\n\nLeda & the Swan (couple)\n\nMainyu & Mazda (conceptual; rivals/opponents)\n\nParis & Helen (Greek; couple)\n\nPelléas et Mélisande (couple)\n\nPersephone & Hades (Greek; couple)\n\nPhilemon & Baucis (couple)\n\nPyramus and Thisbe (couple)\n\nRama & Sita (Hindu; couple)\n\nRomulus & Remus (siblings)\n\nSamson & Delilah (Biblical; couple)\n\nScylla & Charybdis (See also Scylla & Charybdis)\n\nTristan & Iseult (couple)\n\nTroilus & Cressida (couple)\n\nZeus & Ganymede (couple)\n\nEros & Psyche (couple)\n\nSelene & Endymion (couple)\n\nNote: the following list of Sports pairs was initially retrieved from a wikipedia page: \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_pairs\", but this page is no longer available.

The list comes from:\n\nPSYCHOLOGY 461,\n\nHISTORY AND SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOLOGY,\n\nDR. WARREN R. STREET\n\nConscious mentalism - Unconscious mentalism: Emphasis on awareness of mental structure or activity vs. unawareness; coincides with rationalism - irrationalism dichotomy.\n\nBehaviorism - Mentalism: Proper study of psychological focuses on objective content or on subjective content.\n\nDeterminism - Indeterminism - Nondeterminism: Human events completely determined by antecedents and explicable vs. determined but incompletely explicable vs. not determined.\n\nEmpiricism - Rationalism: Major, if not exclusive source of knowledge is experience vs. reason.\n\nFunctionalism - Structuralism: Psychology should describe adaptive activities vs. elemental classes and contents.\n\nMechanism - Vitalism: Activities of living beings completely explicable by physiochemical constituents vs. not so explicable.\n\nMolecularism - Molarism Small versus Large units of behavior.\n\nMonism - Dualism: Fundamental principle or entity in universe is of one kind vs. two kinds, mind and matter.\n\nNativism - Empiricism: Thought and behavior emerges from innate structures vs. emerges from experiences.\n\nSubjectivism - Objectivism: Introspective accounts of experience do, or do not, constitute valid data.\n\nUniversalism - Relativism: Is the world an objective entity, the same for everyone, or is it relative to the perceiver?\n\nThe foregoing is a marvelous list but there are other examples in the outline. The outline even provides some patterns-of-three examples and may well introduce you to the \"Third Force\" topic. However, it doesn't provide a reference to the Monism (one) - Dualism (two) - Pluralism (three) pattern of overall thinking, which is succinctly described as the one - two - many pattern. And in particular, it does not provide you with a similar list of trichotomies... since \"threes\" are very much a part of our historical thinking. The students taking the professor's class are being deprived of a very real thinking pattern, particularly when it is quite pervasive and documented by cultural anthropologists. The students should be up in arms and protest against such a discrepancy in their education. It's time for a Revolution!\n\nGranted that many readers may want to suggest that a third, middle ground be added as a viable consideration, it is necessary to note that not only is there a persistence of dichotomies, but a persistence in the usage thereof. Why isn't there a persistence in the usage of a three-patterned array though many of us recognize the existence thereof? Is it that the brains of students, as a new generation, have a brain developing towards a greater usage of three-patterned observations but instructors, as an older generation have an \"old\" brain which is most comfortable teaching old brain information... like a stagecoach maker who would (assumedly) be more comfortable making stage-coaches than working on an assembly line putting a Cadillac together? Perhaps the field of Psychology (and other subject areas) needs to be made in another image... such as a trichotomous one which can encapsulate dichotomies because a focus on dichotomies has difficulty in doing so. The two-patterned attributes of the right hemisphere changes the existing three-patterned structures of the left hemisphere attributes into patterns-of-two, while the three-patterned attributes of the left hemisphere more easily appreciate the two-patterned structure of the right hemisphere attributes without needing to impose its \"three\"-value on them.\n\nPaul MacLean's triune brain hypothesis distinguishes that the human brain is 3 brains in 1:\n\nTo enhance our appreciation of brain development with respect to categorizing attributes that may help us to better distinguish between a criminal and non-criminal brain, we need to elaborate on a means to help us in differentiating characteristic related to these 3 different brain sections:\n\nAttributes of the brain hemispheres show a distinctive (but somewhat overlapping) partitioning along a 1-patterned, 2-patterned, 3-patterned formula, with the earlier brain structures exhibiting a smaller numerically identifiable value, just as we find in the development of Primordial Germ Layers to the extent that we humans, as a complex organism, grow from 3 Germ Layers, and less complex organisms grow from fewer than 3 layers. See Brain Attributes pages starting here:\n\nBrain Attributes page 1\n\n***Note: Much of the brain illustration shown above was adapted from page 106 of Dean Falk's book entitled \"Brain Dance,\" 1992.\n\n3-patterned formula to brain hemisphere attributes:\n\nWhen we look at the assigned culturally recognized attributes of the brain, we can see a distinct (over-lapping) 1-patterned, or 2-patterned, or 3-patterned arrangement:\n\nLeft Hemisphere\n\n(Predominantly 3-patterned)\n\nMath:\n\nAssociative\n\nCommutative\n\nDistributive\n\nLogic:\n\nMajor Premise\n\nMinor Premise\n\nConclusion\n\nTime Sequencing:\n\nSeconds~Minutes~Hours\n\nPast~ Present~Future\n\nDay~Week~Month\n\nLanguage:\n\nSubject\n\nObject\n\nVerb\n\nRight Body Side:\n\nTri-cuspid heart valve\n\nThree-lobed lung Right Hemisphere\n\n(Predominantly 2-patterned)\n\nHolistic:\n\nMacro versus Micro\n\nWhole versus Part\n\nInner versus Outer\n\nMusic:\n\nMajor Scale vs Minor Scale\n\nLoud versus Soft (Quiet)\n\nConsonance vs Dissonance\n\nVisuospatial: (Art)\n\nBackground vs Foreground\n\nLight vs Dark (Contrasts)\n\n1 Dimension vs 2 Dimensions\n\nEmotions:\n\nPain versus Pleasure\n\nPositive vs Negative\n\nLove versus Hate\n\nLeft Body Side:\n\nBi-cuspid heart valve\n\nTwo-lobed lung\n\nThe correlations of two and three being made on this page are not typical considerations. However, I did come across a single reference concerning the tricuspid valve:\n\n--- Why does the right side of the heart have a TRICUSPID valve? ---\n\nhttp://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/mar97/855255174.An.r.html\n\nIn recognizing that the left lung is smaller than the right lung (which provides room for the heart), let us conjecture that this is due to some past earlier developmental sequence just as we find the 1-layer, 2-layer, 3-layer sequential development of the 3 primordial germ layers (Ectoderm- Mesoderm- Entoderm) in primitive to more complex organisms. Hence, difference in size (dimorphism) as well as a two/ or three prominence may provide another link towards understanding developmental processes. Does this mean that the recurring smallness of the female to the male in many species indicates that females came before the male in terms of species-specific evolutionary development during particular environmental circumstances? If so, will there be an increased development towards a 3 to 1 \"fusion\" ratio?\n\nIn ancient times, it was once thought that a male child was generated from the right testicle and a female child from the left testicle. This right side = male and left side = female is in keeping with the cross-referencing pattern related to brain hemisphere functioning controlling the opposite side of the body, as seen when a person has a stroke.\n\nROOT SYSTEM\n\n(Reptilian)\n\n(Predominantly 1-Patterned)\n\n(Self)-Preservation~ (Self)-Procreation~ (Self)-Preeminence\n\nNote: this \"self\" is a misnomer since it is better identified as not necessarily being aware of ones-\"self\" as an entity. Neither is the \"self\" in this present context to be identified with a \"self\"-referential \"I\" or \"Me\", in terms of an ego-centricism.\n\nSome additional two-patterned references found in music:\n\nTension and Release\n\nStaccato and Legato\n\nSlow and Fast\n\nAscending and Descending\n\nAn analogy to the above 3 divisions (Reptilian~ Mammalian~ Neo(New)-Mammalian) can be made with the ancient view of the world once held by Nordic peoples who thought the three roots and three limbs of the Yggdrasil tree held Earth, Hell, and Heaven together. In their own way, they were illustrating a fundamental organizational structure of the brain that matures along a 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 maturational development sequence. It is because of this underlying basic formula that humans tend to organize world views in a three-patterned manner, in singular and multiple representations thereof.\n\nFor those of you who have a penchant for taking the obvious for granted, please note that the Nordic peoples are part of the Indo-European family, and it is this (3rd born) family, more so than (2nd born) Asians and (1st born) Africans which has the greatest proclivity for developing three-patterned views of the world:\n\nNote: When we use the left hemisphere attribute \"analysis\" to define qualities of the right hemisphere, we often-times assign an additional third criteria in one form or another. When we use the right hemisphere attribute 'viewing' (recognizing) to define qualities of the left hemisphere, we often-times alter the 3-part descriptions into 2-part 'portraits'. For example, (generally speaking):\n\nLeft \"analyzing\" Right: Holistic may acquire the additional term \"Synergy\" or \"Unity\"; Music can develop a Triadic structure; Art acquires a 3rd dimension and 3-color (trichromatic) theory; Emotion is assigned words such as Compassion, Patience, and Empathy.\n\nRight \"viewing\" Left: Math may be seen as Give & Take; Logic may become a Mind/Body dichotomy; Time is related to Life & Death; Language is perceived as High & Low pitch.\n\nLeft \"analyzing\" Reptilian attributes may develop three criteria which distinguish a (3 in 1) singular nature, such as arousal, motivation, and emotion.\n\nRight \"viewing\" Reptilian attributes may picture the basic drives as the seat of emotion whereby a type of kinship alliance is formulated in order to maintain the idea of a dual brain by not permitting the \"Reptilian Brain\" a separate entity status.\n\nIn adding to the above, we could include the following remarks (taken out of their original context):\n\n\"...To further complicate the process, it has been suggested that we have 3 major components in our brain function - instinct, emotion, and intellect. The 3 layers of function correspond to the major layers of brain matter that have been added as we evolved through various stages. Evolution didn't throw much away as humans evolved - our brains have added new layers on top of what was already there instead of the more difficult total restructuring or replacement. We still harbor a primitive reptilian brain at our cores that runs a lot of our subconscious systems like digestion, respiration and circulation. Along the way we picked up a number of only marginally compatible and integrated layers, evolving our conscious minds only with the addition of the outermost layer.\"\n\n--- Perception and Behavior --- by Kort E Patterson\n\nInitial Posting date: Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2014\n\nUpdated Posting: Thursday, Dec. 11, 2014\n\nLatest Update: Thursday, 4th October 2018... 5:32 PM"
