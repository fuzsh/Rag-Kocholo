        "text": "American singer, actress, and television personality\n\nAdrienne Eliza Bailon-Houghton[2][3] (née Bailon ( ); born October 24, 1983) is an American television personality, singer, and actress. She is a former member of the girl groups 3LW and The Cheetah Girls. From 2013 to 2022, Bailon was a co-host of the daytime talk show The Real; for which she has since won a Daytime Emmy Award.[4][5] From 2022 to 2023, Bailon-Houghton was a co-anchor of the entertainment news show, E! News.[6]\n\nAs an actress, Bailon appeared in The Cheetah Girls films, Coach Carter and All You've Got. She has guest starred in numerous television series including That's So Raven (a role she reprises in the spin-off series Raven's Home), and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. In 2013, Bailon became the first Latina host of a daytime talk show in the US.[7] She also competed in The Masked Singer in 2019 as the Flamingo, finishing in third place.[8]\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\n1983–2002: Early life, career beginnings, and 3LW\n\n[edit]\n\nBailon was born to a Puerto Rican mother, Nilda Alicea and an Ecuadorian father, Freddie Bailón, on October 24, 1983. She grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.[9] Bailon has an older sister, Claudette.[10] She attended PS 110-The Monitor in Brooklyn[11] and the High School for Health Professions and Human Services, but did not pursue a career in the medical field because of her musical endeavors.[12] Bailon commented \"I really wanted to be an Obstetrician! I wanted to bring babies into the world...\"[13] Bailon was discovered by Latin pop singer Ricky Martin in October 1999 while she was performing in a church choir at Madison Square Garden.[14] Martin asked for the four best singers in the group, and Bailon was one of the four elected by Martin to perform as back-up singers as part of his Livin' la Vida Loca Tour concert show later that night.[15][16]\n\nFollowing the performance, Bailon became a member of the girl group 3LW, joining Kiely Williams and Naturi Naughton, the other two members of the group. Bailon stated that she was spotted by a producer while on a field trip to Beth Israel, and was later offered a slot in the female trio.[13] Bailon said \"... coming from very humble beginnings in the projects of the Lower East Side and not having any \"Hollywood\" connections.... It did not seem realistic. I sang in church, acted in all the church and school plays.... So when the opportunity came to join a girl group I was ready!\"[17]\n\nWith the original line-up of 3LW formed, the group was signed to Epic Records, and work on their debut album began in 1999. Their first single, \"No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)\", was released in the fall of 2000. \"No More\" was a chart success, and was followed by \"Playas Gon' Play\" in early 2001. The group's self-titled debut album, 3LW was released on November 14, 2000. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA, selling 1.3 million copies in the United States.[18]\n\nIn the summer of 2001, the group embarked on the MTV Total Request Live tour along with Destiny's Child, Dream, Nelly, Eve, and Jessica Simpson. In 2001, 3LW recorded a song with various artists including Michael Jackson, Usher, Beyoncé, Luther Vandross, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey in response to the 9/11 attacks called \"What More Can I Give\". In late 2001, they collaborated with Lil' Romeo and Nick Cannon for \"Parents Just Don't Understand\" on the Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius soundtrack.[19]\n\n3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled Same Game, Different Rules. The album and its intended lead single \"Uh Oh\" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from Same Game, Different Rules were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the girls. A fan support campaign for 3LW, named \"Never Let Go of 3LW\" after their song \"Never Let Go\" spread to the radio, and the act was retained, despite the album loss. Recording a new set of tracks, the group returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single \"I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)\", featuring Loon. That same summer, the group performed a concert special on Nickelodeon titled Live on Sunset. By August, the group was set to release its newest LP, A Girl Can Mack, when member Naturi Naughton left the group for good due to internal disputes. A Girl Can Mack's release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing, with it debuting at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 and selling 53,000 copies in the first week. Approaching the time that the group was ready to deliver their second album, Naughton publicly announced that she was no longer a member of the group.[20][21] Naughton alleged she had had a number of conflicts and arguments with Bailon, Williams, and their management, which led to a heated altercation in August 2002.[20] Not long after, Naughton claimed she had been forced out of the group.[22]\n\n2003–2008: The Cheetah Girls, 3LW disbandment, and acting career\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliams and Bailon continued as a duo while using the \"3LW\" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as \"2LW\".[21] According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of Sister 2 Sister magazine, Kiely & Adrienne said they received death threats and that they had to beef up security. The departure of Naturi greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. After the second single released from the album, \"Neva Get Enuf\", underperformed, auditions were held across the country for a new third member. Jessica Benson made the cut and joined 3LW in early 2003. Without Benson, the group might have had to split due to \"bankruptcy\".[23] Jessica's first performance was on Live with Regis & Kelly, followed by a performance on Soul Train. In fall 2003, 3LW departed from Epic, signing with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def label. The group then began working on their fourth studio album.\n\nWhile working on the album, both Bailon and Williams signed on to star in the Disney Channel film The Cheetah Girls. They starred as two of the four members in a female girl group named after the film, with Raven-Symoné and Sabrina Bryan portraying the other two members. The film was released in August 2003, and was a ratings success. The Cheetah Girls soundtrack debuted at No. 33 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA.[24] Bailon had a supporting role on Disney Channel's That's So Raven in which she played Alana, a personal enemy of the show's title character. In 2005, she appeared as Dominique in Coach Carter, her first theatrically released film. Walt Disney Records soon created a real-life girl group, composed of Adrienne, Kiely, and Sabrina. Raven was offered a spot in the group but declined, opting to focus on her solo career and her television series That's So Raven. The trio began working on their first studio album, later revealed to be a Christmas album. The album, titled Cheetah-licious Christmas, was released that year, and they soon left Walt Disney and signed to Hollywood Records in 2006.[25] Bailon then starred in the MTV film All You've Got, along with R&B singer Ciara. It was released on DVD in May 2006 and premiered on MTV.[26][27]\n\nThe Cheetah Girls later returned to film the sequel The Cheetah Girls 2. It premiered on August 25, 2006, and brought a total of 8.1 million viewers, becoming the highest-rated Disney Channel original movie and beating the premiere of the first of the High School Musical films.[28] The soundtrack was released on August 15, 2006, debuted at No. 5 on the charts and was certified platinum by the end of the year.[29] The Cheetah Girls began work on their second studio album in January 2006. \"We'll be making a real album, not a soundtrack\", Bailon said. The Cheetah Girls' second single from The Cheetah Girls 2 soundtrack, \"Strut\", considered their most successful single, was their highest-peaking single to date, peaking at No. 53 on the Billboard charts. Bailon sung lead vocals and ad-libs. Their debut album TCG was released on September 25, 2007, and featured the single \"Fuego\", which charted on Hot Dance Club Play's chart and had its video played in heavy rotation on Disney Channel and MTV Tr3s.\n\n3LW's fourth studio album was originally called Phoenix Rising, but was renamed Point of No Return.[30][31] The lead-off single, \"Feelin' You\", was added on radio stations July 12, 2006. The album was supposed to be released later that year but was pushed back to a 2007 release because of Adrienne and Kiely's involvement with Disney's Cheetah Girls franchise, and eventually fell off the release schedule. The album delays were caused by image conflicts between both groups. As a result, the album was never released. In early 2007, Bailon stated in Girls Life magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls project. However, rumors were finally put to rest by Bailon in an interview with Jonathon Jackson in 2008 when Bailon confirmed that 3LW officially disbanded after they were removed from the So So Def roster. Bailon and Williams decided to then pursue the Cheetah Girls franchise full-time.\n\nIn 2008, work on the third and final film in the Cheetah Girls franchise, titled The Cheetah Girls: One World, was due to begin. According to Disney, the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to India to star in a Bollywood production,[32] as the film was shot in India.[33] It premiered to over 6.2 million viewers, and reached 7 million viewers in its final half-hour. This still failed to meet the ratings of the first two and was the series' lowest-rated premiere.[34] In the UK, its premiere night scored 412,000 on Disney Channel UK, making it No. 1 of the week, and received 182,000 on Disney Channel UK +1, also No. 1 on that channel for the week, totalling 594,000.[35] Bailon recorded two solo songs for the film's soundtrack album, \"What If\" and \"Stand Up\".\n\nIn November 2008, Williams confirmed in an interview with In Touch Weekly that the group had officially disbanded to pursue solo careers in both acting and singing. Bailon and Bryan later confirmed the statement. As of 2012, the group is still disbanded, though all three members have stated they are \"open\" to working with one another again.\n\n2009–2013: Empire Girls, I'm in Love with a Church Girl\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Cheetah Girls, Bailon was signed to Columbia Records. Making the initial announcement in a radio interview in New York City, Bailon later confirmed the news on her official Twitter page, stating: \"For everyone who wasn't in [New York] – I officially announced I have signed a solo deal with Sony's Columbia Records! So happy I'm finally able to tell you guys...\"[36][37] Bailon began working on her debut studio album shortly after signing with the label. Her first official musical releases were the songs \"Uncontrollable\" and \"Big Spender\", both of which were featured on the Confessions of a Shopaholic film soundtrack, released in 2009.[38] The soundtrack featured songs from numerous artists, including Lady Gaga and the Pussycat Dolls. Later that year, she was featured in the Ghostface Killah song \"I'll Be That\", featured on his eighth studio album Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City.[39]\n\nIn 2009, Bailon ended her relationship with her boyfriend of two years, Rob Kardashian, the brother of Kim Kardashian.[40] [41] While dating Rob, Bailon appeared in a total of eight episodes of the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, appearing as Rob's girlfriend.[42] The show saw Bailon and Kardashian get tattoos with one another, among other aspects of their relationship. On the breakup, Bailon stated \"You know they say opposites attract. I’m a real New Yorker [...] Sometimes I think the things that matter to us were different.\"[43][44] Though the reasoning was not announced at the time of the breakup, it was later revealed that Rob had cheated on Bailon during their relationship, which was the ultimate reason they broke up.[45][46] At the end of 2008, Bailon had appeared on MTV New Year's show from Times Square, in advance promotion of her upcoming afternoon hosting on the channel.[47] In 2009, Bailon hosted the programming block New Afternoons on MTV, relocating to New York City for the job.[48] That same year, she co-hosted MTV News Presents: Top 9 of '09, the year-end MTV New Year's programming live from inside and outside MTV Studios in Times Square.[49][50] In 2012, Bailon announced that she was taking part in the reality show Empire Girls: Julissa and Adrienne, which would revolve around Bailon and friend Julissa Bermudez.[51] Bailon said of the show's premise, \"The show follows us wanting to take our careers to the next level, coming back to New York City, where we’re originally from [...] to take our careers to that next level.\"[52] The show premiered on June 3, 2012[53] and became a ratings success for Style Network.[54] Bailon later appeared in the music video for Pitbull's \"Give Me Everything\".[55]\n\nOn November 1, 2012, Bailon appeared alongside Jesse Giddings and Jim Cantiello, as the co-host of The Pepsi Pre-show Live, a podcast that was sponsored by Pepsi, and broadcast through The X Factor website one hour before every episode in the live rounds of the show. Also in 2012, Bailon separated from Island Def Jam due to creative differences. Bailon portrayed Katalina Santiago in the film, The Coalition, which was released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2013. Bailon appeared in the ABC Family television movie, Lovestruck: The Musical, on April 21, 2013. It showcased Bailon singing the Madonna classic, \"Like A Virgin\" with Sara Paxton and Chelsea Kane. Other songs Bailon sang in the film include a song titled \"Everlasting Love\", featuring Paxton, Kane, and Drew Seeley. Bailon starred alongside Ja Rule in the film I'm in Love with a Church Girl, which was released in October 2013.[56]\n\n2013–present: The Real, The Masked Singer, and E! News\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 2013 to 2022, Bailon served as one of the co-hosts of the syndicated daytime talk show The Real originally alongside Tamar Braxton, Loni Love, Jeannie Mai, and Tamera Mowry. The show premiered on July 15, 2013.[57] Following a trial summer run during 2013 on the Fox Television Stations group, it was picked up to series the following year.[58] Bailon became the first Latina host of a daytime talk show in the US. Bailon and her co-hosts won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host for their work in 2018.[59]\n\nIn 2014, Bailon became the host of a competition show called Nail'd It! on Oxygen. The show was canceled after one season.\n\nIn 2015, she made a cameo on the series Being Mary Jane. On November 17, 2017, Bailon released her debut solo album New Tradiciones, a Christmas album with both English and Spanish songs.[60][61] New Tradiciones would quickly reach number 1 on the Latin charts.\n\nIn November 2018, Bailon launched a jewelry line named XIXI.[62][1] She also owns a vegan handbag line named La Voûte.[1]\n\nIn 2019, Bailon was revealed to be \"Flamingo\" in the second season of The Masked Singer where she finished in third place.[63]\n\nIn 2022, she returned to the role of Alana on the fifth season of the That's So Raven's sequel series Raven's Home, where she is now Bayside High School's principal.[64]\n\nOn October 20, 2022, E! announced that E! News would be revived as a late-night entertainment news program and return to the E! network after a two-year hiatus; Bailon-Houghton and Justin Sylvester (who returned to the show for its revival) served as co-hosts when it premiered on November 14. On October 31, 2023, Bailon-Houghton announced she was resigning as co-anchor due to wanting to spend more time with her family and living on the East coast.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 26, 2015, Bailon announced on The Real the reason why she had not released her debut solo album at that point. She stated that she was \"scared to fail\" and that she did not like the sound of her own voice because executives at Disney praised the fact that she sounded \"so young\". Bailon expressed that when she got her solo record deal at Def Jam, things didn't go the way she expected.[65][66][67][68]\n\nBailon is a Christian. When asked \"Do you relate with I'm in Love with a Church Girl and not get involve[d] with the sins and craziness that Hollywood is all about?\", she replied, \"I think I've definitely tried. No one is left without a sin. Everyone sin [sic] in their own different ways. Never judge one person's sins to be greater and lesser than your own. One thing I'm so grateful for was my foundation in faith. It kept me away from a lot of things like drugs that I never had an interest. I always had my faith in God. My relationship with God helped me to get along not to get caught up in those things.[69]\n\nRelationships\n\n[edit]\n\nBailon dated Rob Kardashian, from 2007 until 2009, after which it was revealed that they broke up because he cheated on her.[70][71]\n\nOn February 5, 2015, Bailon announced that she was engaged to her boyfriend of six years, music executive Lenny Santiago. In September 2015, the couple split and called off their engagement.[72]\n\nBailon announced her engagement to singer Israel Houghton on August 12, 2016 in Paris after six months of dating.[73][74][75] They were married in Paris on November 11, 2016.[76][77][78]\n\nOn August 5, 2022, Adrienne Bailon announced the birth of her first child with her husband via surrogate; Israel Houghton has six children from three previous relationships.[79]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 3LW discography and The Cheetah Girls discography\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Album details Peak positions US\n\nLatin\n\n[80] New Tradiciones\n\nReleased: November 17, 2017\n\nLabels: Bridge Music\n\nFormat: CD, digital download\n\n23\n\nGuest appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nList of non-single guest appearances, with other performing artists, showing year released and album name Title Year Other performer(s) Album \"No Me Digas Que No\" 2004 Enemigo Caminando \"War (Extended Version)\" 2007 Edwin Starr, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker Rush Hour 3 \"No Me Digas Que No\" Xtreme Haciendo Historia: Platinum Edition \"Stand Up\" 2008 — The Cheetah Girls: One World \"What If\" (credited as Chanel) \"Uncontrollable\" 2009 Confessions of a Shopaholic \"Big Spender\" \"I'll Be That\" Ghostface Killah Ghostdini: Wizard of Poetry in Emerald City \"Come With Me\" 2012 Daddy Yankee, Prince Royce, Elijah King Prestige \"Like A Virgin\" 2013 Sara Paxton, Chelsea Kane Lovestruck: The Musical \"Everlasting Love\" Sara Paxton, Chelsea Kane, Drew Seeley \"Days Go By\" Duane Harden, Gilbere Forte #NB4U (Naked Before You) \"I'm With You/Be Still\" 2018 Israel Houghton The Road to DeMaskUs\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nList of film credits Year Title Role Notes 2005 Coach Carter Dominique Credited as Adrienne Eliza Bailon 2008 Cuttin' da Mustard Erma The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 Cute Video Couple Girl Cameo 2012 The Coalition Katalina Santiago Direct-to-video 2013 I'm in Love with a Church Girl Vanessa Leon\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nList of television credits Year Title Role Notes 2001 Taina Gia Episode: \"Blue Mascara\" The Jersey Herself Episode: \"Speaking of Coleman\" 2002 All That Herself Episode: \"3LW\" (uncredited) 2003 The Cheetah Girls Chanel \"Chuchie\" Simmons Television film 2003–2004 That's So Raven Alana Rivera 4 episodes 2005 Taylor Made Madison Santos Television film Buffalo Dreams Domino 2006 All You've Got Gabby Espinoza The Cheetah Girls 2 Chanel \"Chuchie\" Simmons 2007–2008 Disney Channel Games Herself 2008–2011 Keeping Up with the Kardashians 13 episodes 2008 The Cheetah Girls: One World Chanel \"Chuchie\" Simmons Television film The Suite Life of Zack & Cody Herself; with The Cheetah Girls Studio DC: Almost Live Herself; with The Cheetah Girls MTV New Year's Herself Times Square Correspondent 2009–2010 New Afternoons on MTV Host MTV New Year's Host[81] 2011 Kourtney and Kim Take New York Episode: \"In a New York Minute\" Celebrity Nightmares Decoded Episode 2 2012 Empire Girls: Julissa and Adrienne Main role 2013 Lovestruck: The Musical Noelle Television film 2013–2022 The Real Herself Talk show; co-host & producer 2013–2014 Big Morning Buzz Live Herself Weekly special guest correspondent 2014 Celebrities Undercover Episode: \"Adrienne Bailon & Chilli\" Nail'd It!
