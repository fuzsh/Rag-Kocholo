        "text": "Over the last two decades singers and rappers have infected horror movies with reckless abandon. You just never know who will pop up where, but one thing’s for certain … nine times out of ten we just want to see them die horribly!\n\nAJ Michalka (The Lovely Bones) of the kid-friendly musical group 78violet (formerly Aly and AJ) announced today that she’s been cast in the J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg alien based terror tale Super 8. Michalka will be joining the previously announced Kyle Chandler, Elle Fanning, Ron Eldard, Noah Emmerich, Gabriel Basso, Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, and Zach Mills.\n\nSuper 8 tells the tale of a bunch of kids who are shooting a movie with a Super 8 camera that notice upon viewing their footage that they’ve captured what appears to be an alien on film.\n\nLook for more on this one very soon!\n\n– Uncle Creepy\n\nVISIT THE EVILSHOP @ AMAZON!\n\nGot news?
