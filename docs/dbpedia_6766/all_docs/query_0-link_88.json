        "text": "TODAY\n\n10 a.m. on CBS 2018 NCAA Basketball Tournament\n\nLet the games begin! Eight cities across the United States are ready as the NCAA men’s basketball tournament gets under way. The first round includes 16 games today and 16 on Friday that will air on CBS, TNT, TBS and TruTV. Fans will be watching their brackets as upsets are always in the making. Virginia, Villanova and Michigan State are three teams expected to be top seeds in the four regions that include the south, east, west and midwest.\n\n6 p.m. on AMC Movie: Titanic\n\nThe title of director James Cameron’s 1997 drama describes not only its subject, but its impact on filmdom that year. It made megabucks and garnered a whopping 11 Oscars … not bad for a movie whose ending everyone already knew. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as the bride-to-be from first class and the scrappy kid from steerage who find each other on the doomed liner – which, of course, is the real star of the show. Billy Zane, Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also star.\n\n7 p.m. on ABC Grey’s Anatomy\n\nSeries star Ellen Pompeo has her second directing turn on the show with the new episode “Old Scars, Future Hearts,” and she doesn’t go easy on herself in the acting department since her Meredith plays a major role in the story. The doctor wants to know more about the connection her mother had to Marie Cerone (guest star Rachel Ticotin). Alex (Justin Chambers) is concerned about Jo’s (Camilla Luddington) pursuit of a fellowship. Sarah Drew and Kevin McKidd also star.\n\n7 p.m. on NBC Superstore\n\nHonesty may not be the best policy for the Cloud 9 employees in the new episode “Amnesty,” as they’re invited to own up to any and all bad things they’ve done, supposedly without penalty. Secretly, Garrett and Cheyenne (Colton Dunn, Nichole Bloom) have other ideas for what they learn about their colleagues. Jonah and Amy (Ben Feldman, America Ferrera) try to combat a case of store gossip. Mark McKinney, Lauren Ash and Nico Santos also star.\n\n7 p.m. on KDVR Gotham\n\nGordon and Lucius (Ben McKenzie, Chris Chalk) are prompted by Ivy’s (guest star Peyton List) actions to seek out someone from their past in the new episode “A Dark Knight: Reunion.” Sofia (Crystal Reed) makes her play for ultimate power over Gotham. Bruce (David Mazouz) attempts to patch things up with Alfred (Sean Pertwee). Donal Logue, Morena Baccarin, Robin Lord Taylor and Cory Michael Smith also star.\n\n7 p.m. on LIFE Project Runway All Stars\n\nFor a new episode called “Rock Your Face Off,” the remaining designers undertake a challenge that tasks them with creating striking but functional performance wear for a music superstar. Actress and model Olivia Culpo is a guest. Alyssa Milano is host and one of the judges; Anne Fulenweider, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire, is mentor to the designers.\n\n7 p.m. on HGTV Flip or Flop Vegas\n\nExpert home renovators Bristol and Aubrey Marunde are back for their second season as they embark on new episodes that find them tackling high-stakes house flips, major design overhauls and crumbling properties. In the season premiere, they return to the same neighborhood where they launched their flipping career, where they find their next project, a dingy three-level home with a weird layout and a bizarrely placed staircase. Their goal is to make the structure seem more spacious and modern.\n\n7:30 p.m. on NBC A.P. Bio\n\nIn one of her first television appearances since her departure from “Kevin Can Wait,” Erinn Hayes guest stars in the new episode “Freakin’ Enamored,” playing a student’s mother who attracts Jack (Glenn Howerton). To win her over, he pretends to be much more interested in her son’s (Tucker Albrizzi) welfare than he actually is. Principal Durbin (Patton Oswalt) has to decide how to handle concerns about a certain piece of art created in Mary’s (Mary Sohn) class. Singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb also guest stars.\n\n8 p.m. on KWGN Tough Mudder: Tougher Together\n\nThe famous – and famously grueling – Tough Mudder competition is highlighted through profiles of three participating teams in this new special. Each of the leaders is shown to have his or her own deeply personal motivation for wanting to tackle the contest, including a recent widow whose friends and sons are joining her to honor her late husband’s memory. A woman with Down syndrome also competes, along with her father.\n\n8 p.m. on NBC Will & Grace\n\nThough Jack (Sean Hayes) warns him against it, Will (Eric McCormack) decides to revive his relationship with his first love in the new episode “The Beefcake & the Cake Beef.” Karen (Megan Mullally) enlists a hesitant Grace (Debra Messing) in a crusade to get a resistant bakery to make the cake she wants. “Saturday Night Live” alum Vanessa Bayer, Cheyenne Jackson (“American Horror Story”) and Anthony Ramos guest star.\n\n8 p.m. on A&E 60 Days In\n\nCol. Mark Adger knows all too well that time is of the essence now that it’s painfully obvious the cover has been blown on the undercover program at Atlanta’s Fulton County Jail. As rumors spread among the inmate population of the facility, Adger and his team work against the clock in an urgent drive to get all the program participants out of the jail before they fall victim to injury or worse in the new episode “Get Them Out.”\n\n9 p.m. on KWGN Arrow\n\nAs Oliver (Stephen Amell) continues what is shaping up as a never-ending battle with Cayden James (guest star Michael Emerson), he also gets embroiled with Dinah (Juliana Harkavy) in an explosive disagreement that puts the life of one of their own in serious jeopardy, in “All for Nothing.” David Ramsey and Emily Bett Rickards also star.\n\n9 p.m. on ABC How to Get Away With Murder\n\nThe title of the show’s fourth-season finale is “Nobody Else Is Dying,” but don’t bet on that being the fact – especially since a death and the resulting arrest fuel the story, written by series creator Pete Nowalk. The shocks and surprises don’t end there for Annalise (Viola Davis) and her proteges, either. Billy Brown, Jack Falahee, Aja Naomi King, Matt McGorry, Karla Souza, Liza Weil and Charlie Weber also star.\n\nFRIDAY\n\n7 p.m. on NBC Blindspot\n\nA prisoner informs the team of apparently imminent danger, leaving them in doubt about whether to trust the warning, in the new episode “Deductions.” A very uncomfortable Zapata (Audrey Esparza) finds herself a pawn of both the FBI and the CIA. Guest stars include Ron Rifkin (“Alias”), Bruce Davison and Tori Anderson. Jaimie Alexander, Sullivan Stapleton, Rob Brown and Ashley Johnson also star.\n\n7 p.m. on KDVR MasterChef\n\nMilkshakes are the initial matter for the 22 young chefs remaining, as the new “Junior Edition: American Classics” separates them into teams and challenges them to make as many of the fountain favorites as possible within 10 minutes. Then, chicken and waffles are at the crux of the next test facing them. Gordon Ramsay (also the show’s host), Christina Tosi and Joe Bastianich are the judges.\n\n7 p.m. on SHOW Movie: Beyond the Opposite Sex\n\nThis new documentary from filmmakers Emily Abt and Bruce Hensel revisits two trans Americans – one a man, one a woman – who originally were profiled in two Showtime documentaries 15 years ago to focus on life after transitioning, specifically the challenges of building and maintaining relationships in a largely hostile Middle America. Singer, songwriter and Trump supporter Jamie (formerly Jim) lives in Kentucky with a girlfriend, while Rene, now living as an angry Texas male, is engaged to a woman.\n\n7 p.m. on LIFE Bring It!\n\nAs the Dancing Dolls prepare for what is expected to be an epic school-spirit competition, their practices are interrupted when a shocking scandal involving explicit phone texts rocks the team in the new episode “Let’s Talk About Texts, Baby.” The futures of several potential captains are on the line as Coach D ponders appropriate punishments for the Dolls involved in this incident.\n\n7 p.m. on USA The Secret Life of Kids\n\nBilling itself as a “comedic social experiment,” this new series features kids approaching such topics as relationships, love, hate and lying, as captured by hidden cameras. Behind the scenes, childhood experts share insights into the funny ways young people navigate the daily situations they run into in their routines. In the premiere, “First Day of School,” love is in the air for 5-year-olds Halen and Harlo, and Gia P. becomes the queen bee within her own peer group.\n\n7 p.m. on FOOD Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\n\nMost episodes of “Triple D,” as many fans and its host dub this hit show, find Guy Fieri hitting far flung locations all across the United States, but as its title suggests, the new episode “West Coast Cookin’ ” finds Fieri concentrating on eateries along the country’s “left coast.” That’s still plenty of culinary turf, because even just the stretch from Northern to Southern California encompasses a staggering diversity in terms of restaurants and their menus.\n\n8 p.m. on KWGN Dynasty\n\nFallon’s (Elizabeth Gillies) painful discovery that Jeff Colby (Sam Adegoke) proposed to her for reasons of revenge, not romance, is compounded by her realization that she’s stuck in this phony engagement until she can figure out how to protect her family from becoming victims of the Carrington-Colby feud in the new episode “Our Turn Now.” Meanwhile, Sam (Rafael de la Fuente) mounts a double-pronged crusade to win Steven’s (James Mackay) love and become a U.S. citizen. Nathalie Kelley also stars.\n\n8 p.m. on NBC Taken\n\nBryan and Santana (Clive Standen, Jessica Camacho) travel to North Korea to undertake a risky mission to free a nuclear physicist – who was believed to have died years ago – from a high-security prison compound in the new episode “Invitation Only.” Hart’s (Jennifer Beals) request for Kilroy (Adam Goldberg) to find a criminal sought by a foreign government poses a moral crisis for him. Michael Benyaer, Daniel Yang and Uni Park guest star.\n\n8 p.m. on MAX Strike Back\n\nTrying to keep up with the formidable Lowry (Katherine Kelly), Section 20 sets out to track down former CIA contractor Rachel Sheridan (Dervla Kirwan), as Wyatt (Daniel McPherson) tries to win the confidence of her estranged daughter, Lila (Sai Bennett). Jensen’s (Phil Dunster) wish to get closer to Novin (Alin Sumarwata) brings him into the field and, thus, closer to danger, in the new “Episode 7.”\n\n8:01 p.m. on ABC Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nGravitonium may be the solution for the crisis facing the world – provided Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his team can find it in time – in the new episode “Principia.” They don’t have much of a window of time to do that within. Jeff Ward and Catherine Dent (“The Shield”) continue their guest roles. Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons and Natalia Cordova-Buckley also star.\n\n8:02 p.m. on LIFE Laurieann Gibson: Beyond the Spotlight\n\nLaurieann’s latest client is singer-songwriter Justine Skye, and the assignment is to transform her into a pop superstar and market Justine that way to potentially millions of fans. The project almost immediately hits a major hurdle, however, when Laurieann sees that Justine is far more absorbed in her life and celebrity via social media to give much attention to the work required to launch her into the highly competitive world of music in the new episode “Skye’s the Limit.”\n\n9 p.m. on KWGN Jane The Virgin\n\nXo (Andrea Navedo) doesn’t necessarily want the comfort that Jane, Rogelio and Alba (Gina Rodriguez, Jaime Camil, Ivonne Coll) offer when they learn of her situation in the new “Chapter Seventy-Seven.” River Fields (guest star Brooke Shields) has her own plans for what Rogelio has proposed. Rafael (Justin Baldoni) is determined to connect with his sister – and what she might know. Jane has a new reason for discord with Petra (Yael Grobglas), involving Mateo.\n\n9 p.m. on HBO High Maintenance\n\nIn the new “Hashtag Goalz,” The Guy (Ben Sinclair) urges a stressed-out computer programmer (Neimah Djourabchi) to go tech-free for just one night before embracing a life without the distractions of the Internet. A comic (Kate Berlant) is utterly besieged by online trolls after a controversial tweet goes viral. Determined to match or beat a world record, a dancer (Alex Auder) struggles to keep moving as the long hours pass and, one by one, her exhausted dance partners fall by the wayside.\n\nSATURDAY\n\n10 a.m. on CBS 2018 NCAA Basketball Tournament\n\nAnd then there were 32. The NCAA men’s basketball tournament continues with the second round. What started with 68 teams on Tuesday, and 64 on Thursday, is about to be whittled down to the Sweet 16, which are the survivors of games played today and Sunday. There’s always a “bracket buster” or two here as a mediocre team gets hot, or a favorite or two falls, leaving fans scratching their heads and acknowledging the unpredictability of tournament.\n\n5 p.m. on OXY Aaron Hernandez Uncovered\n\nThis two-part special event, which premieres tonight and concludes Sunday, chronicles the complicated saga of the NFL superstar who was a true sports phenom, gathering millions of fans and riches beyond his dreams before events led him down a dark path. This examination of an icon’s shocking double life opens with definitive interviews with members of the Massachusetts State Police, who lay out the strong murder case they built against Hernandez for the killing of linebacker Odin Lloyd.\n\n6 p.m. on STARZ Movie: Trumbo\n\nBryan Cranston scored a well-deserved Oscar nomination as best actor for his performance in the title role of Jay Roach’s 2015 biopic about the life of esteemed screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who landed on the infamous Hollywood blacklist after he declined to cooperate fully with the House Committee on Un-American Activities as it explored allegations that the movie industry was putting Communist propaganda in its films. Diane Lane, Helen Mirren, Elle Fanning, John Goodman and Michael Stuhlbarg also star.\n\n6 p.m. on HBO Movie: The Beguiled\n\nDirector Sofia Coppola became only the second woman in history to win the best director award at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival for this Civil War drama, which updates the female empowerment subtext in a story that previously was a hit 1971 thriller starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. Nicole Kidman stars as the headmistress of a Virginia girls school where her charges become obsessively fascinated by a wounded Union soldier (Colin Farrell) they find. Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning also star.\n\n6 p.m. on LIFE Movie: Mommy’s Little Angel\n\nShe’s only 12, but young Katie (Morgan Neundorf) has endured one rough knock after another during her short life. After her mother dies, an apparent suicide, Katie’s cousin Nikki and her husband decide to adopt her, offering the girl her first happy home in a long time. In fact, she’s so overjoyed by her new life that she’s not going to let anyone, including her unstable father, take her away. Amanda Clayton and Peter Dillon also star in this new 2018 thriller.\n\n6:30 p.m. on NBCSP 2018 Winter Paralympics\n\nThe 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang conclude with over six hours of coverage included in this evening’s telecast, which should allow for both live events and replays with consideration for local time in South Korea. Expect to see gold medal games in wheelchair curling and ice sled hockey. Other gold medal events on the schedule include cross country skiing, as well as alpine skiing, including the women’s giant slalom.\n\n7 p.m. on HALL Movie: The Sweetest Heart\n\nSince her painful breakup 10 years ago with her high-school sweetheart, Nate (Chris McNally), Maddie (Julie Gonzalo) has poured her energy and passion into opening a hometown cupcake shop, which is thriving. She’s on the verge of expanding her business when Nate, now a cardiologist, returns to town and tries to make amends for how things ended between them. Their romance seems on the verge of rekindling when Maddie learns he has a major career opportunity in Boston. Andrea Brooks also stars.\n\n8 p.m. on CNN Christiane Amanpour: Sex & Love Around the World\n\nShe’s spent much of her career focused on global power players and foreign nations ripped by conflict, but now award-winning journalist Christiane Amanpour turns her attention to the shifting topics of love, intimacy and pleasure in a world that gets more complex every day. Amanpour travels to Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, meeting “ordinary” individuals who nonetheless are shaping the idea of modern love and pushing boundaries when it comes to consent, connection and sexual satisfaction in this new six-part series.\n\n9 p.m. on ABC 20/20\n\nIn advance of the revival’s March 27 premiere, the special edition “Roseanne: The Return” previews the rebirth of the long-running sitcom “Roseanne” in a present-day version. Roseanne Barr, John Goodman, Sara Gilbert and recent “Lady Bird” Oscar nominee Laurie Metcalf are among the returning stars who comment on their characters then and now – with clips from the series, also then and now, illustrating their observations about the fictional Conner family.\n\n9:30 p.m. on NBC Saturday Night Live\n\nIt’s always a special occasion whenever a former regular on this show returns to it as a host, and “SNL” alum Bill Hader fills that role for the second time with this new episode. He has a new project to promote: “Barry,” an upcoming HBO comedy series on which he fills many of the key jobs – including playing the title character. The band Arcade Fire is in the musical-guest slot for the fourth time.\n\nSUNDAY\n\n1:30 p.m. on KDVR NASCAR Racing\n\nAuto Club Speedway in Fontana, California (near Los Angeles) is the next stop for NASCAR’s Monster Energy Cup Series with the running of the Auto Club 400. Kyle Larson won last year’s event on the D-shaped oval but Jimmie Johnson has had three victories here, including one during his championship run in 2016, tying him for the record with former teammate Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth. This is the only Cup Series race held here.\n\n6 p.m. on NBC Little Big Shots\n\nExecutive-produced by Steve Harvey (also the host here) and Ellen DeGeneres, the series that showcases talented youngsters starts its third season with “Third Time’s a Charm.” Among those featured is a Frank Sinatra tribute artist, which might not seem that unique a pursuit – until the singer in question is revealed to be four years old. Also showcased are a gospel singer, a contortionist and an expert on U.S. presidents who can recite John F. Kennedy’s inaugural address verbatim. Another episode follows.\n\n6 p.m. on LIFE Movie: The Midwife’s Deception\n\nSeven months into her pregnancy, Sara (Katie Savoy) thinks she finally has found the answer to her prayers in the form of Jina (Penelope Mitchell), a midwife so attentive and caring that she seems almost too good to be true. And guess what? This being a Lifetime movie, she is. In fact, when it comes to the imminent newborn, there’s a good chance Jina may not be satisfied with merely helping Sara give birth. Billy Armstrong also stars in this 2018 melodrama.\n\n6:30 p.m. on KDVR Bob’s Burgers\n\nAs they attempt to make their own birthday presents for the grandmother, the younger Belchers discover a secret room with ceramics that might fill the gift-giving bill – despite the urban legend that’s attached to them – in the new episode “The Secret Ceramics Room of Secrets.” Teddy (voice of Larry Murphy) gets some online help in launching a phone-repair service. Guest voices include Pamela Adlon (“Better Things”), Billy Eichner and David Herman.\n\n7 p.m. on CBS Instinct\n\nAfter his run on “The Good Wife,” Tony Award winner Alan Cumming returns to series work by premiering as an ex-CIA man turned college professor and author. In this “Pilot,” he’s forced to channel his old skills when his first book is used as sort of a play-by-play manual … by a serial killer. The adaptation of a novel by James Patterson (“Zoo”) also features Bojana Novakovic, Naveen Andrews and Sharon Leal. Patterson and Cumming also are executive producers of the show.\n\n7 p.m. on KDVR The Simpsons\n\nTwo people with “Saturday Night Live” ties, Bill Hader and Cecily Strong, are guest voices in the new episode “Homer Is Where the Art Isn’t.” The story is a parody of the 1970s George Peppard detective series “Banacek,” with Hader as a character named Manacek, a sleuth who traces a stolen painting to Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) … who hopes to be proven innocent of the theft. Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith and Nancy Cartwright also are in the voice cast.\n\n7 p.m. on STARZ Ash vs Evil Dead\n\nIn a new episode called “Unfinished Business,” Brock (Lee Majors) returns from the other side to warn his son Ash (Bruce Campbell) that an otherworldly hurricane of pure evil is brewing. Later, Ash and Pablo (Ray Santiago) make a very disturbing discovery at the hardware store, while Kelly and Brandy (Dana DeLorenzo, Arielle Carver O’Neill) find themselves confronting an all-too-familiar foe.\n\n7 p.m. on HBO Here and Now\n\nKnocked off his pins by a startling revelation, Ramon (Daniel Zovatto) looks to the past for escape in the new episode “Fight, Death.” Kristen (Sosie Bacon) finds comfort in the Torah, while Farid (Peter Macdissi) seeks meaning in a translation. Audrey (Holly Hunter) gets a warm reception from Steven Benjamin (guest star Tim DeKay), an old college friend, concerning her Empathy Initiative pitch. Greg (Tim Robbins) submits a forward to Duc’s (Raymond Lee) book.\n\n7 p.m. on HIST Kingpin\n\nThe new episode “El Chapo” takes place in 1990s-era Mexico, which is being rocked by three violent cartels competing bitterly for the country’s drug trade. One brutal and ruthlessly ambitious narco eventually rises above all the others, however, managing to create a single unified – and absolutely terrifying – cartel, in the process claiming a reputation as the most powerful criminal in the history of Mexico.\n\n7 p.m. on HALL When Calls the Heart\n\nThe course of true love rarely runs smooth, and sure enough, Jack and Elizabeth (Daniel Lissing, Erin Krakow) find their wedding plans in serious jeopardy in a new episode called “My Heart Is Yours.” Elsewhere, Bill (Jack Wagner) runs into difficulties of his own while transporting a prisoner. Lori Loughlin also stars.\n\n7:30 p.m. on KDVR Brooklyn Nine-Nine\n\nA furious Seamus (guest star Paul Adelstein) threatens Kevin (guest star Marc Evan Jackson), so Holt (Andre Braugher) hatches a complicated plan to keep Kevin out of harm’s way in a safe house, with Jake as his bodyguard. Kevin reluctantly agrees to go along, but he’s miserable while Jake’s detective friends try to find Seamus and take him down in the new episode “Safe House.” Terry Crews and Melissa Fumero also star.\n\n8 p.m. on CBS NCIS: Los Angeles\n\nMemories of late series co-star Miguel Ferrer and his character are embedded in the new episode “Liabilities,” as Granger’s ex-spy daughter Jennifer Kim (guest star Malese Jow) is brought in by Cullen and Sam (Chris O’Donnell, LL Cool J) to help the team find a covert operative who has the necessary materials to make bombs. Linda Hunt, Daniela Ruah, Eric Christian Olsen and Renee Felice Smith also star.\n\n8 p.m. on NBC Genius Junior\n\nAn episode titled “These Kids Know Something You Don’t Know” makes a very appropriate launch point for this new series, in which host Neil Patrick Harris presides over a competition between teams of bright youngsters – in this premiere, The Dork Side and Team on a Roll. Spelling, math and memorization are among the tests they face, and the winning squad proceeds to the challenging “Cortex” round. (Frankly, just the name of that gives us the chills.)\n\n8 p.m. on KDVR Family Guy\n\n“Send in Stewie, Please” is a new episode notable for a couple of factors: limited commercials and a guest-voice appearance by veteran actor Ian McKellen. He voices the role of the child psychologist at Stewie’s (voice by Seth MacFarlane) school – and their session together yields some very surprising information. It’s interesting to note that for all of the regular characters usually featured on this show, Stewie is basically the entire focus in this half-hour.\n\n8 p.m. on SHOW The Chi\n\nWith a second season already on order, this gritty drama from Emmy winner Lena Waithe (“Master of None”) wraps Season 1 with the finale “Ease on Down the Road,” as Ronnie (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine) confronts his criminal past. Elsewhere, Kevin (Alex Hibbert) stars in his school play, then goes to the cast party with his pals. Brandon’s (Jason Mitchell) scheme to finance his business collapses, and Emmett (Jacob Latimore) decides to fight for full custody of his son.\n\n8:30 p.m. on KDVR The Last Man on Earth\n\nFred Armisen reprises his eccentric guest role as Karl as this off-the-wall comedy series returns for its spring premiere with the new episode “Hamilton/Berg.” The story finds Tandy and Todd (Will Forte, Mel Rodriguez) still badly shaken from the recent graveyard incident, so they desperately try to convince their friends that something is seriously wrong with Karl, something about which they should do something. Meanwhile, Jasper’s whereabouts remain a mystery.\n\n9 p.m. on CBS Madam Secretary\n\nFacing oppression in their homeland, LGBTQ individuals get a literal escape route thanks to Jay and Kat (Sebastian Arcelus, Sara Ramirez) in the new episode “Refuge.” That may last only so long, though, since that country shuts its borders – and American allies develop concerns about the situation. Executive producer Eric Stoltz directed the story and also appears in his recurring series role. B.D. Wong guest stars. Tea Leoni, Tim Daly, Zeljko Ivanek and Geoffrey Arend also star.\n\n9 p.m. on NBC Timeless\n\nExpect to see plenty of tire tracks in the new episode “The Darlington 500,” as Wyatt, Lucy and Rufus (Matt Lanter, Abigail Spencer, Malcolm Barrett) venture back to a 1950s stock-car race to stop a plot against the entire U.S. automotive industry. A pivotal character in the story is real-life NASCAR driver Wendell Scott, played here by guest star Joseph Lee Anderson, but previously portrayed by Richard Pryor in the 1977 movie “Greased Lightning.”\n\n9:01 p.m. on ABC Deception\n\nThough he’s preoccupied with family matters, Cameron (Jack Cutmore-Scott) has to focus his magic on helping some people in trouble in the new episode “Forced Perspective.” Tourists get caught up in what seems to be a reality show, but the truth of their situation is a lot more dangerous – and more potentially lethal – than that. Ilfenesh Hadera, Lenora Crichlow, Amaury Nolasco, Justin Chon, Laila Robins and Vinnie Jones as Gunter Gustafsen also star.\n\nMONDAY\n\n5 p.m. on ESPN NBA Basketball\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks are alive and well in the NBA’s Eastern Conference with hopes for a solid playoff run.
