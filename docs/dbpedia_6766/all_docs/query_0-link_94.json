        "text": "Anthony Hopkins\n\nHopkins, who recently starred in \"The Two Popes\" on Netflix, actually looks pretty similar in his side-by-side photos from over the years. He’s still got that whole, “I want to chop you into bits and pieces and consume you with a nice glass of wine,” look going on.\n\nHopkins himself would never actually take that bite. In fact, he’s said that his outlook on life is to be kind. The Welsh-born star started out in the industry back in 1960 and is still going strong after all of these years. His latest performance was in the movie “One Life,” where he plays the role of British Humanitarian Nicholas Winton.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson\n\nSamuel L. Jackson may not be rocking the same hairstyle as he was in his younger days, but he’s still got the same attitude in his cool stare, that’s for sure. You can almost hear the long string of expletives coming at you through the screen.\n\nJackson has several films and other projects coming out this year, including \"The Banker,\" which is streaming on the Apple app. His most notable work in the past has probably got to be the work he did with the two-time Oscar-winning director and writer Quentin Tarantino in “Pulp Fiction,” in 1994 and again in 2015 with “The Hateful Eight.”\n\nDenzel Washington\n\nIf you would’ve gone to school with a young Denzel Washington, you may have been surprised at how he turned out to be such a smoke show later on in life. Just take a look at the comparison, which shows the Hollywood hunk before he straightened out his teeth and earned himself several Oscars and a $250 million net worth.\n\nThe star found fame in the early 80s in a medical drama series, “St. Elsewhere,” which aired from 1982 to 1988. From there, the rest was history as he earned himself an Oscar in 1990 for his role in “Glory.” His most recent work was in 2023’s “The Equalizer 3,” and we doubt that he will be slowing down anytime soon.\n\nSteven Tyler\n\nThis former rockstar is best known for his days as lead singer and frontman of the rock band, Aerosmith. Everyone is familiar with his hit, \"I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing,\" which was played during a crucial scene in the movie, \"Armageddon,\" which starred Tyler’s daughter, Liv.\n\nLike many other rockstars his age, Tyler still rocks his signature long hair, only now it has some gray streaks in it. It’s crazy to think that Aerosmith formed over 50 years and the band is still doing tours to this day. The band has, however, announced that they will be doing their final “The Peace Out Tour” from 2023 to 2024.\n\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nDepending on when you were born, you may remember this rock legend for a few different things. Some will say it’s his music, others will say it's the reality show about him and his family. It could also be the time he bit the head off of a live bird during one memorable yet insanely creepy and dark performance.\n\nBut, throughout it all, he decided to keep his long locks. Ozzy, also known as “The Prince of Darkness,” became a founding member of the heavy rock/ metal band “Black Sabbath” in 1968. The star has his own Birmingham Walk of Stars, which is located in the same city where the band was formed.\n\nMick Jagger\n\nJagger, who is one of the founding members of one of the greatest rock bands of all time; The Rolling Stones, has had a career in the music industry that’s lasted more than five decades. The picture on the left is during his early music days in the mid-1960s when he and the band used to play for free at clubs.\n\nHe couldn’t have possibly known how big of a name he’d make for himself in the industry. All these years later and today the star has several accolades behind his name, including a Golden Globe award for his tune “Old Habits Die Hard,” which featured in the 2005’s “Alfie.”\n\nJack Nicholson\n\nHere’s another famous 1960s face who was trying to make his way in entertainment way back when. Just like Mick Jagger, Nicholson’s career didn’t seem very promising in its early stages – that is, until later that decade. It’s difficult to say which film was his most prominent but he got his claim to fame in 1969 in the film “Easy Rider,” which got him his first Oscar nomination.\n\nEven though he may have lost some hair over the years, he’s gained three Academy Awards and six Golden Globes and been nominated for 12 Academy Awards. He does look a lot happier these days, doesn’t he?\n\nChristopher Plummer\n\nPlummer is another name on our list that’s been around in the industry for more than five decades. Best known for playing Captain Georg Von Trapp in 1965’s Oscar-winning \"The Sound of Music,\" his smile looks the same today as it did when he starred in the film.\n\nIn 2012, the star got his first Oscar and also a Golden Globe award for his role in the flick “Beginners.” Plummer has also gained himself two Emmy awards for his work in the showbiz sector. The 90-year-old star was honored earlier this year on the game show \"Jeopardy\" when an entire category was devoted to him and his career. Plummer passed away in 2021 at the age of 91.\n\nJackie Chan\n\nThe king of Kung Fu has actually been in the acting game since he was just five years old. The Hong Kong-born star has an extensive career in the showbiz arena, with 149 acting credits to his name, but most people don’t know that he also has 66 producing credits associated with his name, and most of his early career was dominated by producing rather than acting.\n\nHere we’ve got this shot of him from the late 1970s when he started to score his first major roles as an adult. The 66-year-old star looks basically the same now as he did way back when.\n\nJames Earl Jones\n\nJames Earl Jones’ legendary career in Hollywood has lasted an incredible seven decades. He first made his film debut as a bright-eyed hopeful in 1964’s political satire film, \"Dr. Strangelove,\" but only got his claim to fame in 1977 when he was featured in the “Star Wars” series, narrating the villain Darth Vader’s voice.\n\nHis most recent work occurred in the “Obi-Wan Kenobi” series from 2022. It was all uphill from there, as the actor went on to win and be nominated for all kinds of awards. He even still has the same smile as he did when he started out! Actually, it’s a little bit wider these days.\n\nHarrison Ford\n\nThis \"Indiana Jones\" star has broken more than just a couple of hearts in his day. He couldn’t go anywhere in the 1980s without being swarmed by adoring fans who wanted his autograph or to just be anywhere near him. He made his acting debut in 1967 with “The Long Ride Home.”\n\nBut it was his performance in the “Star Wars” saga as Hans Solo and his titular roles in the “Indian Jones” franchise that shot him into the abyss of fame. And, at 77 years old, he’s proving he’s still the heartthrob he always was, by going shirtless in his upcoming film \"Call of the Wild.\"\n\nMarlon Brando\n\nMarlon Brando was making ladies all across America swoon while television was still being broadcast in black and white. When \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" hit the scene in 1951, it solidified his super-hunk status. The actor got his first Oscar in 1955 and a second one in 1973 for his role in the movie “The Godfather.”\n\nAnd with those puppy dog eyes and pouty lips, it’s not hard to see why. By the late 70s, his image in Hollywood had started to fade, although he’ll always be remembered as one of the greats. Sadly, the icon passed away at the age of 80 in the summer of 2004 from respiratory and heart complications.\n\nTom Hanks\n\nThis legendary actor is still at it today, and we think he still has a lot to give to the industry; thank you, universe. He’s continuously impressed us over the years, starring in huge box office hits like \"Forrest Gump\", \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Apollo 13\", and \"Castaway\", just to name a few.\n\nHis roles can keep us on the edge of our seats, make us jump, and make us cry. Lucky for us, he’s still got the same charming smile as he had when he appeared on the scene in 1979. Most recently, he appeared on 2023’s romcom “Asteroid City” as Stanley Zak.\n\nJeff Goldblum\n\nJeff Goldblum made his film debut as a tough (yet silky-haired) thug in \"Death Wish\" in 1974. He pretty much looks exactly the same now as he did when he played that role. Just look at those pearly whites and his smooth skin. In 2022, the star went back to his roots as he appeared in “Jurassic World Dominion.”\n\nWith 143 acting credits to his name, we think it’s safe to say that this guy knows a lot about acting, and we doubt he will be stopping anytime soon. He recently branched out into the world of podcasts as he has been featured on the “Dark Dice” podcast series since 2020.\n\nRobert De Niro\n\nRobert De Niro is unbeatable when it comes to playing the role of the tough guy – or the wise guy. But that isn’t the only reason why the world has come to love seeing him on screen. The icon got his reason for recognition in 1973 when he starred in “Bang the Drum Slowly.\"\n\nAnd from there, it was all smooth sailing as in 1975 he gained his first Oscar for his role in “The Godfather Part II.” He makes this magical combination of tough and hilarious that just keeps us glued to our seats. As of this year, six of his films have been inducted into the US National Film Registry.\n\nPaul Rudd\n\nPaul Rudd has been making us laugh since the mid-'90s. We loved him as the adorable (yet sort of stuck-up) stepbrother on Clueless (the film that got him his breakout role), and we loved him so much more when he started appearing on a string of hilarious hit comedies, like \"Knocked Up\" and \"the 40-Year Old Virgin.\"\n\nHis most prominent film to date has got to be Marvel’s “Ant-Man” and its prequel “Ant-Man and the Wasp.” He’s set to appear in this summer’s new \"Ghostbusters\" film, and he looks exactly the same as he did the first day that we saw him on screen.\n\nWill Smith\n\nWell, we’re pretty sure Will Smith is a vampire, and here are both Exhibit A and Exhibit B. On the left is a shot of Will from his days starring on \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" in the late ’80s and early ‘90s. This is the show that gave the star his stardom status he carries today, but despite the fame that it brought him, Smith claims that it was his least favorite production.\n\nLuckily, he has come a long way since then. On the right? A picture of him from an event earlier this year. He hasn’t aged a day. So, the only rational explanation is that he must be a vampire – or a time traveler.\n\nElton John\n\nSir Elton John is still rocking the same style of shades and suits as he was when he first started playing shows in the 1970s. The difference is that he looks a million times happier now. John is currently on his official retirement tour, as he announced earlier this year it’d be his last.\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that the veteran pop star released a new single that he recorded with Lady Gaga. In 2019, the film \"Rocketman\" was released. It detailed the life of this music legend exhibiting the star's breakthrough years. The role of Elton John was played by the Welsh actor Taron Egerton.\n\nBryan Cranston\n\nCranston is most well-known these days for his role as Walter White on the hit show \"Breaking Bad\", a role for which he won four Primetime Emmy Awards. The show itself was such a hit that it got a total of 16 Emmy awards and a 9.5 rating on IMDb. He's also known for playing Malcolm's dad on \"Malcolm in the Middle.\"\n\nBut long before he was causing chaos in TV land, he was actually performing wedding ceremonies. We bet you didn’t know that Cranston got ordained as a minister when he was younger to help him pay his way before he found fame.\n\nAlec Baldwin\n\nThis funny-man recently celebrated his eight-year wedding anniversary to his wife, Hilaria. Although she’s about half his age, Baldwin still has that whole baby-face thing going for him. The star first got noticed by the world in 1987 when he appeared in the movie “Forever Lulu.”\n\nHis most prominent role has got to be in the four-time Oscar-winning “The Departed.” He may be 62, but those deep-blue eyes have us fooled. He most recently returned to the screen in an episode of \"Saturday Night Live at Home,\" and in 2023, he starred in “Billie’s Magic World,” with his brother William Baldwin.\n\nAbigail Breslin\n\nYou may remember the sweet little face on the left from the hit film, \"Little Miss Sunshine\". She rose to fame in this movie at the age of ten, for which she received an Academy Award nomination. But Abigail Breslin is all grown up now.\n\nIn January 2023, she announced that she married her long-time friend Ira Kunyansky. And today she is one of the most ‘looked-up to’ actors of her generation. She still has the same adorable smile as she rocked on screen in her early years. The difference? Breslin has gone from newbie to in-demand around Tinsel Town.\n\nZac Efron\n\nZac Efron popped up on the scene in the early 2000s, rising to fame as one of the leads on \"High School Musical\". And, even in those days, he earned himself young Hollywood heartthrob status. Unfortunately for every girl in America, ex-cast member (and girlfriend) Vanessa Hudgens swooped him up, and the two were inseparable for years.\n\nOnce they grew up, they decided to break things off and these days, he’s reportedly single. The star has also recently diversified his skills as he has been producing and starring in his hit Netflix series “Down to Earth with Zac Efron” which is still ongoing today.\n\nElle Fanning\n\nElle decided to follow in her older sister Dakota Fanning’s footsteps, becoming an actress in major films when she was still a kid. In fact, she wasn’t even three years old when she made her debut, acting as the younger version of her sister’s character.\n\nThese days, those baby blues are still making us feel all of the things, in films like this year’s \"The Roads Not Taken,\" in which she plays alongside Salma Hayek. The star also recently portrayed Catherine the Great, alongside Nicholas Hoult in the satirical Emmy-winning series “The Great” from 2020 to 2023.\n\nScarlett Johansson\n\nIt’s kind of hard to flip through the channels without seeing some film that Scarlett Johansson is starring in. Although she was still cute as a button during her early years in the industry, she’s now one of the first actresses that come to mind when you think about gorgeous leading ladies.\n\nShe has also been the highest paid in the business since 2018. She made her acting debut in 1994 when she was just ten years old. Her most prominent role to date has got to be in 2003’s Oscar-winning “Lost in Translation,” in which she starred alongside Bill Murray.\n\nDaryl Sabara\n\nDaryl Sabara is barely in his 30s, but he already has almost 90 acting credits to his name. You may recognize the face on the left from playing Juni Cortez in the \"Spy Kids\" series. Over the years, he’s transformed into – well, actually, he looks the same now as he did when he was younger.\n\nHe decided to cut the hair, but aside from that, not much has changed when it comes to Sabara’s looks, which is evidenced by the bushy brows and laid-back smile. Nowadays, the star is married to his wife, Meghan Trainor, and he already shares two children with her.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe\n\nBest known for his work as the leading man in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, it’s pretty hard for Radcliffe to move away from that image, though he did try. He started his acting career in 1999 at the age of 10 years old in the mini TV series “David Copper.”\n\nJust two years later, at the age of 12, he landed the gig that would change his life forever. After leaving his Potter days behind, he went on to appear in TV shows and films such as \"Jungle\" and \"Miracle Workers\". He still has the same doe-eyed look and the same shaggy hair. Hey, that’s why we love him.\n\nJoseph Gordon Levitt\n\nJoseph Gordon Levitt first graced the screens as the adorable alien trapped in the body of a kid on \"Third Rock from the Sun\". From there, the actor went on to do great things in 1999’s “10 Things I Hate About You” and 2009’s “500 Days of Summer.”\n\nThe star has two Emmy awards behind his name for his work on “Create Together,” and “HitRECord on TV.” Even if you’ve never seen an episode of the show, you likely recognize this face. That’s because now, he’s starring in major films left and right. Though if you actually haven’t seen the show, you should, it’s hilarious.\n\nGeorgie Henley\n\nBest known for playing little Lucy Pevensie in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" which grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, Georgie Henley is now all grown up. She’s starred in several films lately, but she’s also putting some of her off-screen talents to use by writing and directing a short film called \"TIDE\".\n\nHenley is also set to appear on the \"Game of Thrones\" prequel show. In 2022, the star revealed that she almost lost her life to a flesh-eating bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis, but we’re glad to report that she’s all well and good now and probably has a lot more to give to the showbiz sector, seeing as she hasn’t even reached her 30s yet.\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nDrew Barrymore has been wowing us on screen since she was the cute little kid in \"E.T.\" (at just six years old) – or the cut-yet-lethal kid in \"Firestarter\". She grew into a gorgeous and talented actress who’s been starring as the hilarious man-eater (quite literally) in the Netflix original series, \"Santa Clarita Diet.\"\n\nShe also has a line of beauty products out now, Flower Beauty, which is currently raising money for global health causes. She also has her own talk show out these days dubbed “The Drew Barrymore Show,” which has been airing since 2020 and is still ongoing.\n\nKristen Stewart\n\nEven though her first television role on Disney was a small, non-speaking part, Kristen Stewart can still say that she was on TV before she even turned ten. Even with that adorable mug, it took her a year of auditioning to land that kind of role.\n\nBut Stewart flipped the tables later in life and was even the highest-paid actress in the world in both 2010 and 2012. Thanks to her prominent roles in the “Twilight” series, she got the BAFTA award in 2010 for Rising Star of the year. In 2022, the star portrayed Lady Diana in the movie “Spencer,” for which she received her first Academy Award.\n\nHilary Duff\n\nBefore Hilary Duff became known as a teen idol for playing Lizzie McGuire, she appeared as Wendy in \"Casper Meets Wendy\". Not long after, she won an award for a supporting role she played in the television film, \"The Soul Collector.\"\n\nDuff seemed to make a seamless transition between being a star in childhood and adulthood – something that many former child stars have proven is not an easy thing to do. Most recently, she produced and starred as Sophie Tompkins in Hulu’s series “How I Met Your Father.” This show received good reviews from critics and audiences, and got renewed for a second season, which came out in 2023.\n\nAriel Winter\n\n\"Modern Family\" fans are all too familiar with the cute, quirky and brilliant Alex Dunphy. But long before she landed her breakthrough role, she was playing parts in television ads at just four years old.\n\nYep, her first time ever appearing on TV was in a Cool Whip commercial in 2002. The actress is still young, (she has barely made it to her 30s), and has a very promising career ahead of her. Most recently, she appeared in the reality competition series “Stars on Mars,” which premiered in the summer of 2023. The show features celebrities cohabitating together on a base camp in Australia.\n\nBlake McIver Ewing\n\nMany child stars fall off of the map when they grow up, and one of those is Blake McIver Ewing. You may remember Blake as the nerdy neighbor kid on \"Full House\". He had some other roles around the ’90s as well, including 1994’s \"The Little Rascals\".\n\nUnfortunately, Ewing’s best days in Hollywood seem to be well in his past. Nowadays, Ewing is focusing on directing live theatre productions. Just before the pandemic hit, Ewing directed a theatrical production starring Jackie Cox from “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”He also has a podcast with the coach of confidence Alison Robertson, “The Con Artist.”\n\nAriana Grande\n\nGrande rose to fame as the cute and bubbly Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon’s \"Victorious\". Now? She’s one of the biggest pop stars in the world, with a Grammy, Brit, MTV Music Video Award, and eight Guinness World Records under her belt. The star has also dabbled in the world of skin care products as she launched her own beauty line in 2021, “r.e.m. beauty.”\n\nThe star also has a perfume range dubbed “Ariana Grande Cloud,” and “Ariana Grande Ari.” Is there anything she’s not doing? In fact, she earned over $72 million last year, making her the highest-paid pop artist of 2020. Thank U, Next!\n\nJerry O'Connell\n\nO’Connell’s career was another that started when he was young. As a kid, he did a lot of ad work for Duncan Hines, and a Frosted Flakes commercial. He got his breakout role as Quinn Mallory in the hit series “Sliders.” The show aired from 1995 when O’Connell was just 21 years old, through to 1999.\n\nBut the adorable actor shed his baby weight and grew into a handsome leading man. O’Connell is married to former model/actress, Rebecca Romijn. Recently the star has been loaning his voice to the series “Star Trek: Lower Decks,” from 2020 to 2023, and “Solar Opposites.”\n\nKeira Knightley\n\nAs of lately, British actress Keira Knightley has been focusing on more artistic ventures, as evidenced by the pivotal mark in her career in 2013; \"Begin Again.\" Before her reemergence in the industry, Knightley appeared in blockbuster hits like \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" for which she became a household name, and also suffered from severe burnout, leading her to take a two-year break from the industry.\n\nKnightley most recently portrayed Loretta McLaughlin in 2023’s crime drama “Boston Strangler,” which got a Primetime Emmy nomination. The movie is based on the true events of a serial killer the Boston area, in the 60s.\n\nFreddie Highmore\n\nWho could forget the face of a young Freddie Highmore, who played the role in the 2005 remake of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", starring Johnny Depp? But Highmore wasn’t nearly finished proving his worth in Hollywood, as he’s still very much active in the acting community today.\n\nAfter starring in \"Bates Motel\" from 2013-2017, he went on to land the starring role on ABC’s \"The Good Doctor \". The British star’s most recent endeavor is that of “The Canterville Ghost,” which aired in 2023. Highmore has barely been around for three decades but we think that he still has a lot to contribute to the showbiz sector.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris\n\nThis funnyman is well-known for plenty of roles, depending on which era you look to, but most recently, it’s for his long-running part as Barney Stinson on \"How I Met Your Mother,\" which aired from 2005 to 2014. He wound up nominated for a whopping four Emmys for his work on the show.\n\nBefore that, he was recognized for his several years playing the title role on \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" He may have grown up, but he’s a legend in the industry no matter which picture you’re looking at. The actor recently starred as Michael Lawson, alongside Marcia Gay Harden in the 2022 series “Uncoupled.”\n\nMacaulay Culkin\n\nWhen Macaulay Culkin first arrived on the scene in the early ‘90s, he was just 10 years old, but he became an instant star. He outsmarted a handful of bad guys all by himself after his horrible parents forgot about him in \"Home Alone\", and America fell in love.\n\nAlthough he took a long break from acting, he recently launched his own comedy site and podcast called \"Bunny Ears\", on which he does parodies, and also appears in the occasional film. Even after all these years in the industry, the star still has a baby face, as you can see in the above picture.\n\nDakota Fanning\n\nDakota Fanning was one of our favorite actresses before she was even 12 years old. She was only ten years old when she played the tear-jerking role of Pita in 2004’s \"Man on Fire\", opposite Denzel Washington. Recently, the two did another production together on “The Equalizer 3,” which came out in 2023.\n\nDakota was only seven years old when she got her claim to fame in the 2001 drama “I Am Sam.” These days, she’s still going strong. In fact, she now stars a gritty period drama about the first woman to be employed by the NYPD in the 1890s, \"The Alienist.\"\n\nBritney Spears\n\nBritney Spears has been in the spotlight since she first landed a spot in the \"Mickey Mouse Club\" at age 11 alongside Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. In 1998, she dropped her first single, \"...Baby One More Time\" – and it marked the beginning of the era of Britney in pop music.\n\nBritney broke the silence in the summer of 2023, when the singer released a single with will.i.am, “MIND YOUR BUSINESS.” Britney has been through a lot since she found fame at a young age and is set to release her own biography dubbed “The Woman in Me,” in which she details her life experiences up till now.\n\nAlyssa Milano\n\nPowerhouse actress Alyssa Milano arrived on the scene in Hollywood when she was just 10 years old. After rising up through the ranks and making a name for herself on \"Who’s the Boss\" and \"Melrose Place,\" she landed the role of Phoebe Halliwell on the hit series \"Charmed,\" in which she also became an executive producer of.\n\nIn 2008, the star got engaged to her best friend, CAA agent David Bugliari, and the two married one year later. The pair welcomed their first child, a son, in 2011 and a second child, a daughter, 3 years later, in 2014\n\nAJ Michalka\n\nAJ Michalka still looks pretty much the same today as she did when she rose to fame with her sister on \"Aly and AJ.\" She then landed the role of Lainey Lewis, Barry Goldberg’s (way too out of his league) girlfriend on the hilarious, critically acclaimed sitcom, \"The Goldbergs.\"\n\nSince Lainey was such a hit, she recently scored her own show in the form of \"Schooled\", on which she currently plays a music teacher back in the same high school as she attended before. This series is a spinoff of “The Goldbergs” and stars big names like Tim Meadows.\n\nHaley Joel Osment\n\nWho could forget Haley Joel Osment’s breakthrough role as the adorable and psychic Cole Sear on \"The Sixth Sense?\" Throughout the early 2000s, Osment played in several other major movies, including the memorable \"Pay it Forward.\" Roger Ebert even called him one of the “best actors working” in those days.\n\nUnfortunately, he couldn’t quite keep that momentum going, and his career seemed to slow down immensely as he got older. He did at least manage to get an Oscar nomination for his role in “The Sixth Sense,” so at least there’s that. Recently. Osment made an appearance on the hilarious “What We Do in the Shadows.”\n\nChristina Ricci\n\nChristina Ricci’s character in \"Addam’s Family Values\" was probably one of our favorite moments in movie history, truth be told. She was brilliant in the 1993 film as the creepy and quite possibly homicidal Wednesday Addams.\n\nShe put out masterpiece after masterpiece throughout the 00s, like \"Casper,\" \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\" \"Monster,\" and more. She’s won an incredible number of awards throughout her decades-long acting career, throughout which she’s maintained her unique yet classic beauty. Most recently, Ricci graced our screens as in Netflix’s award-winning hit series “Wednesday,” where she portrayed the teacher Marilyn Thornhill.\n\nVanessa Hudgens\n\nVanessa Hudgens first made a name for herself in the industry during her time as Gabriella Montez in \"High School Musical.\" She and co-star, Zac Efron, were involved romantically for a number of years while they worked together on the franchise. Currently, the star is planning her wedding with her fiancé Cole Tucker.\n\nThe pair started dating during the early stages of the pandemic and got engaged in February 2023. She looks basically the same in 2020 as she did during her time on HSM – down to the hairstyle and everything (hey, why fix something, or cut something, that isn’t broken?)\n\nAshley Tisdale\n\nAshley Tisdale is another famous face on the list who found fame on \"High School Musical.\" She’s said that she brings something different to every character she plays – and it’s true from what we’ve seen! Her looks have remained pretty much the same through the years, although we haven’t seen much from her since around 2015.\n\nBut just because we haven’t seen her, doesn’t mean that she’s not been busy. The star has formed her own production company, “Blondie Girl Productions,” and she also launched her own care product line “Being Frenshe,” which boasts items like candles, fragrances and other skin care products.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nSelena Gomez is one of the biggest pop stars in the world, with huge, chart-topping hits like, Come and Get it and Love You Like a Love Song. She also has her own skin care line dubbed “Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez” which she launched in 2019.\n\nBut before she was a mega-star, she actually got her start working with the big purple dinosaur way back on \"Barney and Friends\" in 2002. Aside from her talent in the music industry, she also does some acting and production work. The star gave a stellar performance in the three-time Emmy-winning series “Only Murders in the Building,” which started airing in 2021 and is still ongoing.\n\nBrendan Fraser\n\nBrendan Fraser was one of the hunkiest stars in Hollywood in the 90s. In 1997, he starred in \"George of the Jungle,\" showing off his chiseled chest, and in 1999, he played in \"The Mummy,\" which also won him an army of female fans. Recently, however, fans of Fraser claimed that he looked pretty unrecognizable when he showed up on the red carpet with sparse hair and a much larger frame.\n\nMake no mistake, Fraser is not going to let his age or figure hold him back in the showbiz sector. He recently got his first Oscar for the flick \"The Whale\" and has a slew of new productions on the way, and that includes the upcoming \"Batgirl\" from Warner Bros.\n\nMatt LeBlanc\n\nMatt LeBlanc was once widely known as the hottest male star in the \"Friends\" cast. Joey was so revered that he managed to get his own show with the same title, which aired from 2004 to 2006. However, he made sure to avoid the vanity that corrupted his sitcom character by letting his hair go fully grey in his 40s and has no issues when it comes to rocking a dad bod nowadays.\n\nThe actor's confidence and contentment in his own skin still manages to make the ladies swoon, though, despite some audiences claiming that he looked 'old' when he played on the recent \"Friends: The Reunion\" show.\n\nThe Olsen Twins\n\nAshley and Mary-Kate Olsen had their fate for fame sealed when they were just six months old when their parents signed their first deal on their behalf. The two started acting on \"Full House\" when they were just nine months old. By the time they had reached nine years, the twins had a net worth of $10 million.\n\nUnderstandably, fame from such a young age was a lot for two youngsters to handle, so nowadays, they are rarely spotted in public. They have retreated so much from the public eye that neither of them has any social media profiles. Both have long given up on acting, and they are now thriving as fashion designers.\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nThe iconic Oprah Winfrey made most of her fortune on her hit talk show, which aired for a hefty 25 years. In 1988, she shed 67 pounds and notoriously rolled a cart full of the actual fat she lost onto the stage of her talk show. She maintained a healthy lifestyle over all the years, so much so that she became the ambassador for Weight Watchers in 2015.\n\nShe stated, \"I believe in the Weight Watchers program so much I decided to invest in the company and be a member in its evolution.\" Today, she is considered one of the richest self-made women in the U.S., with a net worth of over $3 billion.\n\nDwayne Johnson\n\nDwayne Johnson, also known as The Rock, used to rock the WWE arena but successfully managed to wiggle his way into a flourishing acting career in the early 00s with minor roles here and there. In 2007, he landed himself the leading role in the movie \"The Game Plan,\" and in 2013, he had a big year as he got parts in \"The Fast & Furious\" franchise and \"G.I. Joe: Retaliation.\"\n\nThe man also produced and starred in HBO's \"Ballers\", which ran from 2015 to 2019. Most recently, in 2022, he jumped abroad on the DC Extended Universe ship when he got the token role in \"Black Adam.\"\n\nAlicia Silverstone\n\nAlicia Silverstone got shot into fame after she starred in \"Cryin\" and \"Amazing\" music videos by Aerosmith in the early 1990s. She lodged herself as a Hollywood essential in the cult classic \"Clueless\" in 1995 when she portrayed Cher. Just two years later, she landed herself a role in \"Batman and Robin.\"\n\nThe star has managed to stay in the loop on-screen with roles in \"The Baby-Sitters Club,\" \"American Woman,\" \"Braceface\" and \"Miss Match.\" Off-screen, the actress has been open about a vegan lifestyle and parenting her child Bear Blu, who was born in 2011. She has even authored two books called \"The Kind Diet\" and \"The Kind Mama,\" in which she opens up about the ways in which she raises her son.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar was omnipresent in the Hollywood scene in the 90s. She had leading roles in the hit \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and a whole list of big movies like \"Scooby-Doo\" and \"Cruel Intentions\", to name a few. In 2002, she wedded Freddie Prinze Jr., and the pair now share two kids, Charlotte and Rocky, and have been married for over two decades.\n\nIn 2015, the star used her platform of fame and launched Foodstirs, which sells cooking kits for kids. The star made a mighty comeback in 2022 when she starred as Kirstin Ramsey in \"Wolf Pack\" (a \"Teen Wolf\" spinoff.)\n\nSelma Blair\n\nIn the 90s and early 00s, Selma Blair was featured beside a bunch of Hollywood's hottest stars, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Julia Stiles and Cameron Diaz. Some of the big-shot films she starred in include \"Cruel Intentions\" (which gave her, her claim to fame), \"Hellboy,\" \"Legally Blonde\" and how could we forget \"The Sweetest Thing.\"\n\nIn 2016, the star made an on-screen appearance in the movie \"Anger Management\", and she also portrayed Kris Jenner in \"American Crime Story.\" The actress came out publicly in 2018, revealing her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and she persists in publicly fighting the disease. In 2017, the star was dubbed one of Time Magazine's Person of the Year as she was one of the Silence Breakers who spoke up against sexual assault and harassment. You go, girl!\n\nNatalie Portman\n\nThanks to the stellar performance that Natalie Portman gave at the age of 12 in \"The Professional,\" she was labeled as an actress of a certain caliber at a young age and still manages to live up to her reputation after all these years. Since the star's breakthrough in 1994, she has landed huge hits like \"Star Wars: Episodes I to III,\" \"Avengers: Endgame\", and even some independent favorites like \"Garden State.\"\n\nIn 2010, Portman dropped 20 pounds from her already slender figure for her role in \"Black Swan.\" We think it was worth it, though, because she won herself an Oscar for Best Actress for her role in this movie. This honor checked the box for the first actress born in the 1980s to have won an Academy Award. Go, Portman!\n\nJodie Foster\n\nJodie Foster made her acting debut when she was only six years old, in the \"Andy Griffith Show\" spinoff \"Mayberry R.F.D.\" She got her first Oscar nomination for her role in \"Taxi Driver\" at the age of 14. In 1976, she starred in the original \"Freaky Friday\", establishing her as a child star.\n\nIn 1988 Foster got her first Oscar for her role in the disturbing movie \"The Accused,\" in which she portrays a rape victim. Her most prominent on-screen credits from the 21st century include \"Panic Room,\" \"Elysium,\" and \"The Mauritanian\", in which she gained a Golden Globe in 2021 for best supporting actress.\n\nJennifer Connelly\n\nJennifer Connelly entered the Hollywood scene in the late 80s with her illustrious role in the 1986 fantasy \"Labyrinth\" beside the iconic David Bowie. Her roles after this flick were not very note-worthy, but in 2000, the actress made a stark comeback in the devastating \"Requiem for a Dream\" in which she portrayed Marion Silver, an aspiring fashion designer who plunges into a nasty substance addiction.\n\nFrom there, there was no stopping the star, as she won an Oscar in 2001 for her role in \"A Beautiful Mind.\" In 2022, the actress joined Tom Cruise in \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" Connelly has been married to the English actor Paul Bettany since 2003, and the pair share two children together.\n\nRyan Gosling\n\nThe Canadian kiddo got his moment of glory at the age of 12 when he joined \"The All-New Mickey Mouse Club.\" Since then, showbiz has been working magic for him, or shall we say he has worked magic for it? Since he entered the Hollywood scene, he has played every type of guy under the sun.\n\nIn \"Half Nelson\", he portrayed a junkie teacher, and in \"The Notebook,\" he was the perfect man of every girl's dream. Most recently, he acted as Ken in the most anticipated film of 2023, \"Barbie.\" The actor earned himself a Golden Globe award for his performance in 2017's \"La La Land.\" He has also received Oscar nominees, and we doubt he will be slowing down anytime soon.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nBefore the Hollywood stardom, the activism, the production company, the model girlfriends, and let's not forget the Oscar for \"The Revenant,\" he started out as a homeless teen living with the Seaver family in 1991's \"Growing Pains.\" Leonardo DiCaprio has gained six Oscar nominations for all the great roles he has portrayed.\n\nOver the last three decades, the star has landed himself some of the most prominent roles in Hollywood favorites like \"Titanic,\" \"Inception,\" \"Romeo + Juliet,\" \"The Beach,\" \"Catch Me If You Can,\" and \"Blood Diamond\" just to name a few. The star has also scored two Golden Globe awards, and given his great success in the Showbiz sector so far, we think he probably still has a lot more to offer in the coming years.\n\nCameron Diaz\n\nCameron Diaz's acting career sprawls over nearly three decades. She got her claim to fame at the age of 21 in 1994's \"The Mask,\" where she starred as Tina Carlyle alongside Jim Carrey. From there, her career in Hollywood really took a turn as it was just blockbuster after blockbuster.\n\nIn 1998, she starred in one of the most buzzing films at the time, \"There's Something About Mary,\" which further catapulted the star into fame. Her final film was \"Annie\" in 2014, after which she ultimately retired from the acting thing. Since then, she has mostly kept her and her family's life out of the public eye. In 2019, she and her husband, Benji Madden, welcomed their first child into the world- Raddix.\n\nChristina Applegate\n\nChristina Applegate got her breakthrough role on Fox's sitcom \"Married with Children\", which first aired in 1987 when Applegate was 16 years old. Before that, she was acting on the soap Opera \"Days of Our Lives\" when she was just a few months old. Most recently, she's played the titular role in the critically acclaimed series \"Dead to Me.\"\n\nThe star has a hefty 81 acting credits to her name, according to IMDb, and we don't think she will be going anywhere anytime soon. The star is currently married to the Dutch Bassist Martyn LeNoble from the band \"Porn for Pyros\", with whom she shares one child, Sadie Grace. In 2021, the star opened up to the world about her battles with multiple sclerosis but still manages to rock in the world of acting.\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nEver since Justin Bieber was spotted on YouTube by Scooter Braun, the talented singer has become one of the most prominent names in all of music. In 2009, he launched his debut EP, \"My World,\" and a year later, he brought out his first full-length album, \"My World 2.0.\" Despite being a teen at the time, he quickly developed a huge fan base, mostly became of his hit singles \"Baby\" and \"One Time.\"\n\nSince then, the singer has released five more studio albums and 76 singles - which is a lot of music! Not bad for someone who is still so young! In 2018, he tied the knot with model Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin) in a New York Courthouse before the two did a big party one year later in South Carolina.\n\nLara Flynn Boyle\n\nFrom the late 80s all the way until the early 00s, Lara Flynn Boyle was an icon in the tabloids. The \"Twin Peaks\" actress graced the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and even entered into a romance with Jack Nicholson, which was a really high-profile story at the time.\n\nThe brunette beauty, who is now in her 50s, is rarely spotted out and about but revealed that she isn't very tech-savvy of late, so she doesn't have a clue about what the media is saying about her these days. She claims that she doesn't even know how to use a smartphone or Google, so she doesn't really pay any heed to what is being written about her, especially not the rumors that she's undergone cosmetic procedures.\n\nMeg Ryan\n\nWith a gorgeous smile and a bouncy demeanor, Meg Ryan was America's ruling romcom queen throughout the 80s and 90s. The world couldn't get enough of the blue-eyed, bubbly personality at one stage. These days, the \"When Harry Met Sally..\" and \"City of Angels\" star is rather reclusive as she is rarely seen out in public.\n\nHer most recent work was in 2020 on the \"Cut and Run\" podcast series, where she did the narration. Recently, the star celebrated her 60th birthday and seems to be quite satisfied as she enters into a new decade with the way her life has played out so far.\n\nWinona Ryder\n\nWinona Ryder pretty much started being Hollywood's It Girl in the late 80s, thanks to her roles in \"Heather\" and \"Beetlejuice.\" She later appeared in \"Girl, Interrupted,\" \"Little Women,\" and \"Edward Scissorhands\" in the 90s, which shot her even further into the craters of fame.\n\nShe also dated Johnny Depp in the early 90s, which fueled her fame even further. After a little incident of shoplifting in 2001, the star took a break from the scene but came out with flying colors in 2016, when she portrayed the hysterical mother in \"Stranger Things.\" The \"Reality Bites\" star has been dating fashion designer Scott Mackinlay Hahn since 2011.\n\nEddie Murphy\n\nThere is no denying that Eddie Murphy is the quintessential comedy superstar. After a successful spell on the standup circuit and on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Murphy made the smoothest of transitions to the Hollywood stage, becoming one of the biggest movie stars of the '80s. He was the lead of hits such as \"48 hrs,\" \"Coming to America,\" \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" and \"Trading Places,\" to name a few.\n\nMurphy also had a successful time in the '90s, most notably for his role as Sherman Klump in \"The Nutty Professor.\" It's safe to say that Murphy's career took a bit of a dip in the decades that followed, coinciding with a pretty eventful personal life. With that said though, he has had something of a resurgence in recent times, starring in films such as \"Dolemite is My Name,\" \"Coming 2 America,\" and \"You People.\"\n\nHayden Christensen\n\nOh, where would we be without good old Hayden Christensen? This enigmatic heartthrob from Canada has had quite the rollercoaster ride of a career if we do say so ourselves. With many excited to see what he could deliver as Anakin Skywalker in the second and third installments of the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy, many moviegoers used poor Hayden as a scapegoat for their disdain for those movies.\n\nUltimately, poor writing and direction put Hayden in a terrible position, ultimately putting him in the Hollywood wilderness for a couple of decades. After a highly publicized relationship with Rachel Bilson, Hayden finally reclaimed the character of Anakin and made an incredible comeback, reprising the role in Disney shows such as \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" and \"Ahsoka.\"\n\nEmma Watson\n\nThere was always a chance that Emma Watson's career could have completely fallen off after her time as Hermione Grainger came to an end. The British talent was one of the key components of the success of the \"Harry Potter\" film franchise. But Watson continued to stay relevant in Hollywood and beyond, featuring in movies such as \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" \"Noah,\" \"The Circle,\" and the live-action remake of \"Beauty and the Beast.\"\n\nOutside of film, Watson has also developed a reputation as a passionate activist, working as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and advocating for gender equality. Watson has also had a successful fashion career, modeling for the likes of Burberry and Lancome.\n\nMila Kunis\n\nFor the first few decades of the 21st Century, Mila Kunis seemed to be the girl that everyone either wanted to be, be with, or work with. She first burst onto the scene with her role as Jackie Burkhart in the hit series \"That '70s Show.\" Around the same time, she also played the voice role of Meg Griffin in the irreverent animated sitcom \"Family Guy.\"\n\nEventually, Kunis blossomed into a full-fledged Hollywood star, making waves with her performances in flicks such as \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" \"Black Swan\" and \"Friends with Benefits,\" among others. Her relationship with Ashton Kutcher has also been regarded by many as one of the most high-profile in Hollywood in recent memory.\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nShe is still so young, and yet, it feels like Jennifer Lawrence has been on our screens since the dawn of time. This talented actress became the must-have for Hollywood's biggest studios, landing roles in some of the biggest film franchises of the last few decades. These included her role as Katniss Everdeen in \"The Hunger Games\" franchise, as well as her rendition of the character Mystique in the X-Men prequels.\n\nOutside of big IPs, Lawrence has also shown her acting chops in smaller indie films such as \"Silver Linings Playbook\" and \"mother!,\" to name a few. In fact, it seems that Lawrence became a little disenfranchised with the big blockbusters she was so accustomed to starring in, as she was hungry for a wider variety of roles and opportunities.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nIt's safe to say that Jennifer Aniston will always be best remembered for her iconic role as Rachel in what many consider to be the greatest sitcom of all time in \"Friends.\" The \"will they, won't they\" dynamic between her character and Ross was enough to keep people coming back for more, week in and out.\n\nAnd it's safe to say that out of everyone in the cast, Aniston found the most success post-\"Friends.\" Not only did she have roles in movies such as \"Bruce Almighty,\" \"The Break-Up,\" and \"Just Go with It,\" but Aniston has also been in two high-profile marriages, with Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux, respectively. In more recent times, Aniston has been the lead of the critically acclaimed Apple TV+ series \"The Morning Show,\" for which she won multiple awards.\n\nJessica Alba\n\nAfter a few child roles that didn't exactly set the world alight, Jessica Alba reached the masses with her role in the hit series \"Dark Angel.\" It didn't take long before she made the jump to the big screen, landing the lead role in 2003's \"Honey.\" Alba went on to appear in some huge movies, playing Susan Storm in the \"Fantastic Four\" film franchise, and starring in \"Valentine's Day,\" \"Sin City,\" \"Spy Kids: All the Time in the World,\" and many more.\n\nCoinciding with her acting career, Alba also had a hugely successful modeling career, featuring in magazines such as Vanity Fair and FHM. Alba has been married to Cash Warren since 2008 and the couple have since had three kids together.\n\nBrad Pitt\n\nWhat can we say about Brad Pitt that hasn't been said before? What separates this iconic star from others on this list is that Pitt has been relevant pretty much all the time since the early '90s. Ever since he showed up in \"Thelma and Louise,\" it was clear that Pitt was destined for greatness.\n\nHis good looks, charm, and charisma landed him roles in classic films such as \"Fight Club,\" \"Se7en,\" \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" \"Troy,\" \"Ocean's Eleven,\" and many, many more. At one point, he was one-half of Hollywood's most powerful couple but has since separated from Angeline Jolie. Even today, Pitt continues to wow moviegoers with his skills, starring in hit movies such as \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" and \"Bullet Train.\"\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nLet's face it - you always have a bit of a head start in Hollywood when you are the daughter of someone as talented as Jon Voight. And yet, Angelina Jolie still managed to eclipse he father in pretty much every way as her career unfolded. Jolie showed the world what she was made of when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \"Girl, Interrupted.\"\n\nFollowing this, Jolie landed the role of Lara Croft in the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise. And while she has also starred in movies such as \"Kung Fu Panda,\" and \"Maleficent\" over the years, Jolie's last decade was remembered most because of her marriage to Brad Pitt. In more recent times, Jolie entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing Thena in \"Eternals.\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\nWe don't think that anyone has had a trajectory in Hollywood quite like Robert Downey Jr. Many actors have reached dizzy heights only to succumb to addiction, the pressures of fame, and crime. But with Downey, it was quite the opposite. Despite being a talented actor from day one, Robert struggled with some pretty strong vices back in the '80s and '90s.\n\nHe showed lots of promise though, especially for his role as Charlie Chaplin. It seems though that Jon Favreau reignited Downey's career when he cast him as Tony Stark and made him the speerhead of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Playing Iron Man turned Downey into one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood. He also had a key role in 2023's \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nRyan Reynolds\n\nDon't we all love a bit of Ryan Reynolds from time to time? At one point, Reynolds was the quintessential rom-com/comedy guy. He was the star of hits such as \"National Lampoon's Van Wilder\" and \"Just Friends,\" among others. It seemed though that the young Canadian man wasn't going to hit the big time after his failed attempt as a superhero in 2011's \"Green Lantern.\"\n\nFive years later though, Reynolds hit the jackpot when he landed the role of a lifetime as Deadpool. Since then, Reynolds has also become something of a poster boy for Netflix, starring in multiple films for the streaming service. Also, he's married to Blake Lively, and owns a Welsh soccer club with Rob McElhenney, so he pretty much has everything going for him."
