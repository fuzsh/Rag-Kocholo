        "text": "“The End of the F***ing World”\n\nRelease Date: January 5\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Alex Lawther, Jessica Barden; directed by Jonathan Entwistle and Lucy Tcherniak, written by Charlie Covell\n\nOur Review: “‘The End of the Fucking World’ is worth sticking with (unless you’re utterly intolerant of animal abuse, which is a persistent theme). Even if you’re not immediately engrossed — and who knows, you very well could be — keep going to discover what’s got everyone talking.” — Ben Travers\n\n“Rotten”\n\nRelease Date: January 5\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nOur Review: “The goal of each episode isn’t to draw clear heroes and villains and lay a clear path to which companies or growers to direct your purchasing power towards. The show doesn’t provide an easy path to absolution that buying from one supplier will bring about justice or that withholding business from another will cause an industry-wide sea change. But like the best documentary efforts, it puts forth these stories with the idea that a more informed audience is a healthier one.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Devilman Crybaby”\n\nRelease Date: January 5\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Kōki Uchiyama, Ayumu Murase, Megumi Han, Ami Koshimizu, Kenjiro Tsuda, Atsuko Tanaka, Rikiya Koyama; written by Ichirō Ōkouchi\n\nBased on Go Nagai’s “Devilman,” this anime follows the journey of Akira Fudo, a Japanese high-schooler tasked with fighting the forces of evil after demons emerge to take over the world.\n\n“My Next Guest Needs No Introduction”\n\nRelease Date: January 12\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Host David Letterman; guests include President Barack Obama, George Clooney\n\nOur Review: “But if talk show watchers are yearning for that living room feel, the idea that anyone watching is a casual observer of a conversation between friends rather than guests, this may be a show that fills some sort of void. Because it’s removed from the burden of having to do late night bits or riffing on popular news cycle nuggets, there may not be as easy a hook, leaving viewers to tune in purely based on who the guest is. But should the rest of the episodes follow the spirit and overall approach to the experiment that this first one does, its value will be felt, even at one installment a month.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Somebody Feed Phil”\n\nRelease Date: January 12\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Phil Rosenthal\n\nRosenthal, the creator of “Everybody Loves Raymond,” is the center of this global cuisine tour that spans four different continents. Bringing in not just himself, but family and friends, his culinary curiosity takes him across the cities of Saigon, Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Mexico City, New Orleans and Bangkok.\n\n“Trolls: The Beat Goes On!”\n\nRelease Date: January 12\n\nNumber of Episodes: 13\n\nTalent: Amanda Leighton, Skylar Astin, Ron Funches, David Koechner\n\nPicking up after the end of the movie, this animated series with an impossible amount of color follows the rainbow-hued crew around Troll Village. There’s a birthday dilemma, a pie theft, and an entire holiday built around Hugs. And to make it even more magical, a second season popped up not even two months after the first one did.\n\n“Dirty Money”\n\nRelease Date: January 26\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: directors Alex Gibney, Jesse Moss, Erin Lee Carr, Kristi Jacobson, Brian McGinn, Fisher Stevens\n\nCollecting installments from six different documentary directors, this series takes aim at corruption in the financial sector. From the banking world to Wall Street to the business empire built by the current Oval Office occupant, each episode looks at how big money and crime intertwine.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n“Llama Llama”\n\nRelease Date: January 26\n\nNumber of Episodes: TBA\n\nTalent: Jennifer Garner, Shayle Simons, Vania Gill, Islie Hirvnonen, Brendon Sunderland\n\nBased on the popular children’s book series, Garner voices Mama Llama as she leads her family and their friends through the ups and downs of life. Various artistic contributors include the directors of “The Lion King” and “Doc McStuffins.”\n\n“Altered Carbon”\n\nRelease Date: February 2\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Joel Kinnaman, Renée Elise Goldsberry, James Purefoy, Martha Higareda, Dichen Lachman; written and created by Laeta Kalogridis\n\nNetflix’s latest huge sci-fi push surrounds the adaptation of Richard K. Morgan’s 2002 novel, which describes a world where a human’s emotional and mental existence can be downloaded into another body. When the consciousness of a mega-rich murder victim works his way into the body of a younger man, it’s up to an ex-soldier to solve the mystery.\n\nOur Review: “‘Altered Carbon’ is a hollow shell of a series about hollow shells of people. Set in the distant future, Netflix’s big budget, CGI extravaganza asks grand questions about the meaning of life, what makes us human, and how science and religion can connect, but this body-swapping drama takes things far too literally, and sucks the life out of its subjects in doing so.” — Ben Travers\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n“Coach Snoop”\n\nRelease Date: February 2\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: subject Snoop Dogg\n\nSnoop Dogg created his own youth football league and he wants to share all his life lessons with you. Think “Last Chance U” meets…Snoop Dogg.\n\n“Queer Eye”\n\nRelease Date: February 7\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Antoni Porowski, Bobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France\n\nThe Bravo hit that ran from 2003-2007 is back with a new Fab Five at a new home. The eight episodes will follow the same spirit and the same guiding categories, but Ted Allen and company have given way to a new central quintet, featuring “Gay of Thrones” star Jonathan Van Ness.\n\nOur Review: “Yet shortening the title gives it a broader element, indicating how the ‘queer eye’ doesn’t just improve the life of a singular straight guy. There is an episode featuring a gay man, but it goes beyond that. By embracing a man’s life in so many ways, it acknowledges the fact that it’s not just his life being changed. Because, as John Donne once wrote, no man is an island. We have so many opportunities to learn from each other, to grow and explore, and to improve the worlds of those who surround us. Not all of us can do it as fabulously as these guys, but they can inspire us to try.” — Liz Shannon Miller\n\n“Everything Sucks”\n\nRelease Date: February 16\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Peyton Kennedy, Jahi Winston, Patch Darragh, and Claudine Mboligikpelani Nako, Sydney Sweeney, Elijah Stevenson, Quinn Liebling, and Rio Mangini; created by Ben York Jones and Michael Mohan\n\nNetflix had one of their biggest hits by tapping into America’s collective love of the 80s. Trading in the Upside Down for Boring, Oregon, this new show will jump 22 years in the past to follow two misfits (Kennedy and Winston) who make a movie to cope with their roller-coaster high school experience. Judging by the Pop-Up-Video-inspired, Everclear-backed first look, there’s plenty of Northwest ’90s nostalgia to bask in.\n\nOur Review: “Once you get about halfway through the season, ‘Everything Sucks!’ dials in; it starts trusting its story about Kate, the narrative gets the go-ahead to ‘giddy up!’ and things really start clicking. Kennedy’s quiet, anxious, and excitable turn makes Kate identifiable in her childlike curiosity, timidity, and wonder. Many of Kennedy and Kate’s best scenes are dialogue-free, as the actress conveys so much of what her character is going through with fervent glances and patient, processing stares. She is present all the time (even if her less dynamic co-stars aren’t always ready to match her).” — Ben Travers\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nFirst Team: Juventus\n\nRelease Date: February 16\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Alessandro Del Piero, Federico Bernardeschi, Giorgio Chiellini, Douglas Costa, Gonzalo Higuaín, Claudio Marchisio, Miralem Pjanic, Daniele Rugani, Gianluigi Buffon, Massimiliano Allegri.\n\nLong a supporter of docs about American football, Netflix is embedding with the world-famous Italian FC, with the first three episodes premiering on the 16th. Much like their stateside offerings, the show will follow life on and off the field for the squad that’s grabbed six straight Serie A titles.\n\n“The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale”\n\nRelease Date: February 18\n\nNumber of Episodes: new installments weekly\n\nTalent: host Joel McHale\n\nJoel McHale is starring in a Joel McHale talk show where Joel McHale talks like Joel McHale did on his other Joel McHale talk show. Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.\n\n“Seven Seconds”\n\nRelease Date: February 23\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Regina King, Clare-Hope Ashitey, Beau Knapp, Russell Hornsby, Raúl Castillo, David Lyons, Michael Mosley, Zackary Momoh; created by Veena Sud\n\nThe latest series from former “The Killing” boss Sud, “Seven Seconds” is a new anthology series looking at one crime’s impact on a community. Telling the story of a black teen killed by a white police officer, this opening season will track not only the victim’s parents (King and Hornsby), but the assistant prosecutor tasked with working on the case (Ashitey).\n\nOur Review: “In the end, ‘Seven Seconds’ is a diverting watch made better by Regina Freaking King and a few powerful scenes scattered amidst an overwritten season. Cut ‘Seven Seconds’ in half and restructure it, who knows? Maybe it could be an elite season. Too many Netflix originals could’ve benefitted from tighter editing from the scripts to the footage, but that’s another discussion for another time. As it stands, ‘Seven Seconds’ should get people talking. Let’s just hope it’s for the right reasons.” — Ben Travers\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n“Ugly Delicious”\n\nRelease Date: February 23\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: host David Chang, director Morgan Neville\n\nBecause Netflix and food have a continuous, healthy relationship, “Chef’s Table” and “Somebody Feed Phil” will give way to “Ugly Delicious,” the latest in a line of chef/travel series. With world-renowned chef Chang as the featured subject, the show will bring in special guest stars like Ali Wong, Gillian Jacobs, Jimmy Kimmel, Alan Yang, Nick Kroll, Jonathan Gold, and David Simon to help investigate different approaches to cuisine and culture across the globe.\n\nOur Review: “Each episode is as dense as a Momofuku Milkbar compost cookie with elements ranging from the typical roundtable discussions and travelogue hallmarks to advice on how to pick a proper Chinese restaurant and more scripted bits. This is where Neville’s deceptively meandering storytelling style helps to alleviate some of the information overload, creating a looser and lighter tone. But a word of warning: Because of the crowded nature of each episode — which run between 45 minutes to an hour apiece — each installment is best savored solo, not to be binged, even if that is the Netflix way.” — Hanh Nguyen\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n“B The Beginning”\n\nRelease Date: March 2\n\nNumber of Episodes: 12\n\nTalent: director Kazuto Nakazawa\n\nAnother in Netflix’s growing collection of anime Originals, this series takes place on a fictional island nation where police detectives investigate a serial killer. Expect a mix of mystery, tech, and nature in a story that looks at how “new humans” might be able to help crack the case.\n\n“Flint Town”\n\nRelease Date: March 2\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: directors Zackary Canepari, Jessica Dimmock and Drea Cooper\n\nFlint, in the midst of a harrowing water crisis, also has an understaffed police department to respond to the city’s growing crime rate. This series follows police officers and community members as they navigate the growing challenges in Flint, especially in the aftermath of the local government cover-up surrounding the city’s resources.\n\nOur Review: “‘Flint Town’ isn’t intended as a referendum on the intentions of law enforcement officials. The idea that there are profession-specific ideals that even the members of the Flint Police Department disagree on deflates the idea of treating ‘the police’ as a single entity. It doesn’t negate the concerns that many subjects and viewers have about the current state of police-community relationships in cities big and small. If anything, it’s proof that, at least in Flint, the department is not hardened to those viewpoints.” — Steve Greene\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n“Girls Incarcerated”\n\nRelease Date: March 2\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nFollowing a group of individuals at a Madison, Indiana correctional facility, “Girls Incarcerated” looks at both the young girls facing a life behind bars, but the families that each of them are separated from. The docuseries also includes perspective from the Madison Juvenile Correctional Facility staff, including teachers, social workers, and officers.\n\n“Nailed It!”\n\nRelease Date: March 9\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Nicole Byer and Jacques Torres\n\nRather than enlist professional — or at least overly competent — chefs for this cooking competition, “Nailed It!” looks for ordinary would-be bakers to pull off elaborate recipes. (Needless to say, sometimes these creations aren’t exactly smashing successes.) Byer and Torres are the hosts of a show where the grand prize is a smooth $10,000.\n\n“A.I.C.O. Incarnation”\n\nRelease Date: March 9\n\nNumber of Episodes: 12\n\nA high school student is the only answer to a giant experiment gone haywire in this Hiroaki Michiaki anime. (When will scientists learn that trying to create a new organism will never turn out right?!)\n\n“On My Block”\n\nRelease Date: March 16\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Diego Tinoco, Jason Genao, Sierra Capri, Brett Gray, Ronnie Hawk, and Jessica Marie Garcia\n\nSurviving high school takes on a slightly different meaning in this high school comedy, as a group of close-knit friends deal with the regular perils of being a teenager and the particular challenges of their neighborhood. This new series comes from “Awkward.” creator Lauren Iungerich, along with Eddie Gonzalez and Jeremy Haft.\n\nOur Review: “‘On My Block’ viewers, prepare yourself for quite the roller coaster. The 10-episode first season focuses on Netflix’s new favorite demographic, young teens, but the stakes go far beyond the typical high school drama. And also it’s quite often very funny, in a way that leaves you disoriented, unsure if what you’re watching is a comedy or a drama, kid-appropriate or all too adult. It’s ‘Sixteen Candles’ meets ‘The Goonies’ meets ‘Boyz in the Hood,’ sometimes all at once, and it is chock full of feels.” — Liz Shannon Miller\n\n“Wild Wild Country”\n\nRelease Date: March 16\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: directors Chapman Way and Maclain Way\n\nRecently premiered at Sundance, this six-part series chronicles the history of one man’s dispute with local Oregon ranchers that somehow combines bioterror, felony wiretapping, and a giant collection of luxury automobiles. Directed by the Ways, who made the 2014 Netflix doc “The Battered Bastards of Baseball,” this docuseries is also executive produced by another pair of brothers: Mark and Jay Duplass.\n\nOur Review: “‘Wild Wild Country’ does what neither side did in the ’80s: It pushes past the assumptions, the rage, the discrimination, the overt and implied xenophobia, and the troubling connections between church and state to illustrate what these people have in common and what prejudices drove them apart. It takes the time to dwell in every conceivable emotion, and your opinions of certain individuals may shift repeatedly throughout the six episodes.” — Ben Travers\n\n“Alexa & Katie”\n\nRelease Date: March 23\n\nNumber of Episodes: 13\n\nTalent: Paris Berelc, Isabel May, Tiffani Thiessen, Emery Kelly, Eddie Shin, Jolie Jenkins, Finn Carr\n\nNetflix has had mixed success with multicam sitcoms, making some of the networks greatest and most troubling series. Looking to veer more toward the former than the latter, “Alexa & Katie” takes the view of two incoming high school students who are trying their best to navigate a world that not only includes usual teen troubles, but ongoing cancer treatments as well. This story of friendship and family comes from creator Heather Wordham and Emmy-nominated showrunner Matthew Carlson.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nOur Review: “Perhaps if ‘Alexa & Katie’ earns a second season (and we feel young viewers will be clamoring for more of these winning characters), it can take more risks and dig a little deeper. Disney-style comedies don’t have to be the only way to reach our youth when it comes to discussing cancer, but it’s what we got in ‘Alexa & Katie,’ and for now, it’s enough.” — Hanh Nguyen\n\n“Requiem”\n\nRelease Date: March 23\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Lydia Wilson, Joel Fry, James Frecheville, Sian Reese-Williams, Brendan Coyle; director Mahalia Belo\n\nCello virtuoso Matilda Gray (Wilson) has her world flipped upside down when her mother unexpectedly commits suicide. In her search for answers, Matilda finds that her mother might also be connected to a mysterious disappearance over two decades prior. This psychological thriller miniseries debuted on BBC One in February.\n\nOur Review: “And as is true in many a monster story, sometimes it’s humanity’s capacity for manipulation that seems the hardest thing to recognize…it forces the people swirling around both characters to confront which they would rather hold responsible: a shadowy force lingering just beyond a bedroom mirror or someone living right down the street.” — Steve Greene\n\n“The Mechanism”\n\nRelease Date: March 23\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Selton Mello, Carol Abras, Enrique Diaz; director José Padilha and writer Elena Soarez\n\nPadilha, director of both “Elite Squad” films, has broken box office records with tales of police and corruption in his native Brazil. Teaming with Soarez, this latest series brings a similar story to Netflix, where the cat-and-mouse intrigue will play out over a TV run. Though this drama is fictional, the story of a team of investigators working to expose a massive federal scheme does draw on real events.\n\n“Rapture”\n\nRelease Date: March 30\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Nas and Dave East, T.I., Rapsody, Logic, G-Eazy, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, 2 Chainz and Just Blaze; directors Sacha Jenkins, Ben Selkow, Geeta Gandbhir, Steven Caple Jr., Marcus A. Clarke, Gabriel Noble\n\nThis new doc series pulls back the curtain on some mammoth hip hop acts to see the lives behind the performers. Following from the stage to their living rooms, this series enlists a number of different directors to create distinct looks at each artist. Audiences will get a first taste of the show when it premieres at the 2018 SXSW Film Festival.\n\nOur Review: “‘Rapture’ isn’t the comprehensive, watch-in-full project that its premise might suggest…For whatever may come before and after those shots of die-hard fans, these installments are ultimately closer to curiosities than necessary puzzle pieces to understanding these performers. They’re windows into fame, but whether they are genuine glimpses of the everyday life that comes with it is up for the viewer to decide.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Fastest Car”\n\nRelease Date: April 6\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: a Dodge Viper, a couple Lamborghinis, an orange McClaren\n\nNetflix might have a “Top Gear” challenger on its hands with this new spin on the car competition show. In this series, those luxury autos listed above will face challengers from unlikely sources: a Buick Grand National or an early-’70s Ford Pinto. Watching to see if these clunker-looking rigs can outclass some of the world’s most desired vehicles looks like a real racing treat.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nOur Review: “‘Fastest Car’ is a rare underdog story where, when it comes to the final showdown, it doesn’t seem preordained whether or not the unlikeliest competitors will come out on top. Even for races that don’t end in dramatic fashion, their lead-up gives each participant a legitimate argument for why they could conceivably win. And whether by accident or by a careful seeding process, the big finale that ends the season ends up as a mix of supercars and sleepers — this isn’t a show meant to guarantee that an enterprising, blood-sweat-and-motor-oil spirit will triumph over people who lay down a half-million dollar check for their part of the race.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Troy: Fall Of A City”\n\nRelease Date: April 6\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Louis Hunter, Bella Dayne, David Threlfall, David Gyasi, Frances O’Connor\n\nA re-telling of the classic Helen/Paris love story and the millenia-old fallout, this BBC/Netflix production looks to bring an epic scope to the miniseries form. All your other favorites from Greek mythology are here: Hecuba, Hector, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Achilles, Zeus, Hera, Aphrodite, Artemis, and many more. From writer David Farr (“The Night Manager”) and “Black Mirror” director Owen Harris, the UK finale is set to coincide with its global all-at-once premiere on Netflix.\n\nOur Review: “The tiny diversions from the norm seem thrilling by comparison, but aside from Achilles and Odysseus, most of the players in the story are fulfilling orders. Even for a show hurtling to a well-known endpoint, it’s familiar in its telling. That may be a comfort to some, but for those looking for a fresh mythical spin, have your horses ride elsewhere.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Lost in Space”\n\nRelease Date: April 13\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Molly Parker, Parker Posey, Toby Stephens, Ignacio Serricchio, Max Jenkins, Mina Sundwall\n\nAn update of the 1960s classic sci-fi adventure comedy, this version of “Lost in Space” takes place sometime in the 2040s, as one family is sent to establish a new colony in the outer reaches of space. When they get lost along the way, they have to navigate a dangerous series of new lands and shaky intergalactic alliances. Oh, and they’re not alone: Two unlikely companions on the journey have different reasons for getting stuck with the Robinsons, ones they have to figure out for themselves.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nOur Review: “As entertainment, the show only works when it’s building suspense in those perilous situations, and that becomes redundant. The dialogue, relationships, world-building, and performances all feel half-baked, as if they don’t matter as much as depicting the cold hard facts of survival. That’s a substantial portion of the show overall, and it’s likely more than enough to turn off anyone who’s not watching with younger viewers or a die-hard science-fiction fan.” — Ben Travers\n\n“Chef’s Table: Pastry”\n\nRelease Date: April 13\n\nNumber of Episodes: 4\n\nTalent: subjects Christina Tosi, Corrado Assenza, Jordi Roca, and Will Goldfarb\n\nDrafting off the creative success of the wide-ranging culinary art doc series “Chef’s Table,” David Gelb’s follow-up series about gorgeously photographed food and the people who prepare it extends into the world of desserts. The subjects of this four-part spinoff come from Italy, Spain, Indonesia, and the US, opening their kitchen to a crew that’s already made one of the great food shows in recent TV memory.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n“Aggretsuko”\n\nRelease Date: April 20\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nThe beloved Sanrio character, a red panda just trying to get through her life at an office job, is getting her own Netflix anime. Fans of animated metal karaoke, prepare thyselves.\n\nOur Review: “So cute. So cuddly. And Retsuko’s death-metal vocals will shred your clothes and melt your face off. Netflix’s newest animated series is raging against the machine and looks adorable doing it.” — Hanh Nguyen\n\n“Spy Kids: Mission Critical”\n\nRelease Date: April 20\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Ashley Bornancin, Carter Hastings, Mira Sorvino, Tom Kenny\n\nRebooting the Robert Rodriguez film series for an animated TV audience, “Mission Critical” finds Juni and Carmen at a training school for young spy recruits. No Alan Cumming to be found here, but with some fun guest performers like Patton Oswalt, Molly Shannon, and Kate Micucci (not to mention a giant nemesis named Golden Brain), this still looks like plenty of fun.\n\n“The Letdown”\n\nRelease Date: April 21\n\nNumber of Episodes: 7\n\nThis Australian import is another parenting comedy. But told through the story of new mother Audrey (co-creator/co-writer Alison Bell), “The Letdown” also digs into all the things that come with caring for a new child. Every episode of this 7-part first season is directed by Trent O’Donnell, the man behind the original versions of “Review” and “No Activity.”\n\n“Bobby Kennedy for President”\n\nRelease Date: April 27\n\nNumber of Episodes: 4\n\nTalent: interview subjects Harry Belafonte, Rep. John Lewis, Dolores Huerta\n\nA half-century after he began his presidential run, Robert F. Kennedy will receive a docuseries tribute from “Gideon’s Army” and “Trapped” director Dawn Porter. Using interviews with Kennedy associates, the four-part series looks to highlight the former Attorney General’s acheivements and complicated legacy following a life tragically cut short. “Bobby Kennedy for President” will also feature new archival footage alongisde the testimonials from those who knew the man best.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nOur Review: “Everything is indeed messed up, and whether your recurring nightmare is a lack of respectable political leaders or the seemingly unending scourge of gun violence (or both), ‘Bobby Kennedy for President’ offers compelling parallels for each. Dawn Porter’s four-hour documentary is first and foremost an intimate examination of the complicated title figure, but it consciously evokes topical points bound to be on the minds of modern viewers. Though the sheer bulk of it all can make digging through individual episodes a bit dense, the structure is clear enough to keep drawing you in, especially when it hurts.” — Ben Travers\n\n“The New Legends of Monkey”\n\nRelease Date: April 27\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Chai Hansen, Luciane Buchanan, Josh Thomson, Emilie Cocquerel\n\nThis Australia/New Zealand co-production reimagines “Monkey” for a new generation, taking the story from the classic Chinese novel “Journey to the West” — following a monk and his pursuit of sacred Buddhist scrolls — and bringing it to a different hemisphere. “New Legends of Monkey” comes from “Top of the Lake” producers Hakan Kousetta and Jamie Laurenson.\n\nOur Review: “Because ‘The New Legends of Monkey’ looks slick and is fun, it should be a draw for families who want an entertaining co-viewing experience. It’s just a shame that a new generation of viewers won’t get to see an all-Asian version of this tale.” — Hanh Nguyen\n\n“A Little Help with Carol Burnett”\n\nRelease Date: May 4\n\nNumber of Episodes: 12\n\nTalent: Carol Burnett, Russell Peters, guests Wanda Sykes, DJ Khaled, Lisa Kudrow, Brittany Snow, Finn Wolfhard\n\nKids, as you may know, have plenty of opinions. So through the inquiring minds of grade schoolers, legendary actress/comedian Carol Burnett will get some pint-sized perspective on some of the biggest issues facing our world today. Special celebrity guests will bring in some of their biggest personal dilemmas to see if these kids have answers the rest of us would never have thought of.\n\n“The Rain”\n\nRelease Date: May 4\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Alba August, Mikkel Boe Følsgaard, Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen, Lars Simonsen, Iben Hjejle\n\nOnce again, the world has ended on TV. This time, the apocalypse heads to Scandinavia, where a pair of disease-resistant survivors come out of their protective bunker for the first time in six years. Meeting a wandering band of fellow people still alive, the new group looks for any sign of civilization still left. In true post-disaster form, it looks like things don’t go exactly smoothly for them. “The Rain” is co-created by “Borgen” writer Jannik Tai Mosholt.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nOur Review: “Despite his best efforts, for a show where humanity is under attack, you ultimately need a reason to root for at least most of the humans. ‘The Rain’ never gets to the point where you’re pulling for the water droplets, but this is one barren wasteland that makes it difficult to care about anything other than surviving it.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Evil Genius: The True Story of America’s Most Diabolical Bank Heist”\n\nRelease Date: May 11\n\nNumber of Episodes: 4\n\nTalent: director Barbara Schroeder, co-director Trey Borzillieri\n\nOur Review: “The problem is that to pursue the story behind this particular bank robbery means committing to examining subjects at the center of it, who are fundamentally at odds with what a doc like this is usually trying to do. Part of the paradox of ‘Evil Genius’ is recognizing that it’s trying to wedge an unusual case into a familiar framework.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Explained”\n\nRelease Date: May 13\n\nNumber of Episodes: New episodes weekly\n\nOur Review: “‘Explained’ is proof that sleek and well-produced content like this doesn’t always have to be watered down. It’s possible to make something that’s engaging on a sensory level without robbing those visuals of meaning. And ‘Explained’ is a series that requests (and in its more complex explanations, demands) viewers’ attention. Although these are compact deliveries of information, there’s a density in each subject that rewards a close watching of how the different elements of each topic interact with each other.” — Steve Greene\n\n“The Break with Michelle Wolf”\n\nRelease Date: May 27\n\nNumber of Episodes: New episodes weekly\n\nFresh off a hilarious HBO special last winter and a stellar set on “Seth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity,” Wolf will get her own weekly half-hour show to talk about the news in her own, distinct way. Said Wolf of the upcoming series, “You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV.”\n\n“November 13 — Attack on Paris”\n\nRelease Date: June 1\n\nNumber of Episodes: 3\n\nTalent: directors Jules and Gédéon Naudet\n\nOur Review: “By removing much of the preceding and following elements of these attacks, ‘November 13’ becomes more of an oral history of a tragedy than a statement on what should be done going forward. While it’s impossible for something like this to exist in a vacuum of perspective, prioritizing the stories of those who survived the attack itself rather than spend a greater percentage of the story on any political repercussions is a conscious choice that mitigates the opportunity for these harrowing experiences to be used as instruments for something else.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Treehouse Detectives”\n\nRelease Date: June 8\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTwo bear siblings solve neighborhood mysteries in this series, which comes from the studio behind fellow Netflix animated children’s series “Luna Petunia.”\n\n“The Hollow”\n\nRelease Date: June 8\n\nNumber of Episodes: 10\n\nTalent: Adrian Petriw, Ashleigh Ball, Connor Parnall\n\nA trio of teenagers find themselves in mysterious circumstances on this animated series. As Kai, Mira, and Adam start to unravel the truth behind who they are and why they’ve ended up in a bunker.\n\n“La Balada de Hugo Sanchez”\n\nRelease Date: June 17\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nA spinoff of the popular soccer dramedy “Club of Crows,” this season follows Hugo (Jesús Zavala), assistatnt to the club president, as he accompanies the team on an overseas trip. While the team prepares for an upcoming tournament, the unassuming Hugo gets his biggest chance yet to shake off his timid, unassuming ways.\n\n“Cooking On High”\n\nRelease Date: June 22\n\nNumber of Episodes: 12\n\n2018 has seen an explosion of Netflix food shows, but this is the first one to toss in some cannabis. Using some of the familiar format touches of other competition shows, the two chefs in each episode are also assigned to use at least a hint of marijuana in the dishes they make for the judges.\n\n“Secret City”\n\nRelease Date: June 26\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Anna Torv, Jacki Weaver, Damon Herriman\n\nA summer 2016 release in Australia, this government conspiracy thriller makes its way to the States on Netflix. Following the inner workings of local and national Australian government, Torv plays a journalist who uncovers a growing, mysterious threat as U.S./China diplomatic relations go south.\n\n“Kiss Me First”\n\nRelease Date: June 29\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Tallulah Haddon and Simona Brown, Matthew Beard, Haruka Abe, George Jovanovic, Freddie Stewart, and Misha Butler\n\nOur Review: “‘Kiss Me First’ has the kernel of something intriguing here as it posits a different type of wish fulfillment but never takes the time to explore all of its possibilities. The show’s adherence to tired storytelling tropes hamstrings it from becoming more profound, exciting, or original. Instead, it somehow manages to be both sleepy and bleak, which only drives viewers to seek out a different reality elsewhere.” — Hanh Nguyen\n\nBased on Lottie Moggach’s 2013 debut novel, “Kiss Me First” follows Leila (Haddon), an online gamer who meets the mysterious Tess (Brown) while inside a virtual world. Shortly after her digital friendship translates into reality, Tess goes missing. Posing as Tess back in the realm where they met, Leila begins to uncover the truth behind what happened to her. “Kiss Me First” comes from “Skins” co-creator Bryan Elsley.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\n“The Forest (La Forêt)”\n\nRelease Date: June 29\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nTalent: Suzanne Clément, Samuel Labarthe, Alexia Barlier, Frédéric Diefenthal\n\nClément (co-star of “Mommy” and “Laurence Anyways”) leads this story of a police officer searching for a missing teenage girl in the Ardennes Forest. Similar to “Requiem” or “Top of the Lake,” as Virginie investigates the details surrounding the disappearance, she finds more of her own story than she’s ready for.\n\n“Harvey Street Kids”\n\nRelease Date: June 29\n\nNumber of Episodes: 13\n\nTalent: Lauren Lapkus, Stephanie Lemelin, Kelly McCreary, Danny Pudi, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Anna Camp, Chris Diamantopoulos\n\nAnother addition to Netflix’s stable of DreamWorks animated series, “Harvey Street Kids” follows three friends and their neighborhood adventures. Some of them involve bike races or cereal boxes, but a few of them even bring in a handful of furry friends, too.\n\n“Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits”\n\nRelease Date: June 29\n\nNumber of Episodes: 5\n\nHistory meets reality in this show that puts ordinary citizens through the same test of skills and wits used to train secret recruits during World War II. After the opening episode winnows the group down, the remaining participants undergo written and physical trials as a way to prove their aptitude.\n\n“The Comedy Lineup”\n\nRelease Date: July 3\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Michelle Buteau, Phil Wang, Taylor Tomlinson, Ian Karmel, Jak Knight, Sam Jay, Sabrina Jalees, and Tim Dillon\n\nOur Review: “15 minutes can still be a perilously short amount of time to make an indelible first impression, but this setup does reward comics who come right out of the gate with a lot of energy. The nice thing about this collection is that doesn’t necessarily mean people who are screaming and being confrontational with the audience. It translates to people who really start right out of the gate with a good hook and can establish some confidence with the audience right away.” — Steve Greene\n\nA second collection of comics (including Aisling Bea, Emma Willmann, Janelle James, Josh Johnson, JR De Guzman, Kate Willett, Matteo Lane, and Max Silvestri) arrives on August 31.\n\n“Sacred Games”\n\nRelease Date: July 6\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui\n\nOur Review: “It’s a crime epic that wants to consider what the police in a giant city owe to those they serve and the consequences of a cutthroat reputation built on dispatching any challengers at any moment. But these get passing glances in a tale that’s as expansive as Gaitonde’s aims. There’s beauty in the way that all of this sinister intrigue is conveyed, but it’s a surface-level telling of a story that wants to have so much more in its grasp.” — Steve Greene\n\nBased on the Vikram Chandra novel of the same name, this detective drama weaves together the worlds of police, politics, cults, and Bollywood for a story about the pursuit of a crime boss. Bombay is the main stage, but the trail extends beyond the city as officer Sartaj Singh (Khan) stumbles on things even he’s not prepared for.\n\n“Samantha!”\n\nRelease Date: July 6\n\nNumber of Episodes: 7\n\nTalent: Emanuelle Araújo, Douglas Silva, Sabrina Nonato, Cauã Gonçalves\n\nNetflix’s first Brazilian comedy follows the title former child star (Araújo) as she looks to regain her former glory.

The show also co-stars Sanma Akashiya, who plays a fictional version of himself who mentors Onishi on his journey to Jimmy.\n\n“Dark Tourist”\n\nRelease Date: July 20\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nTalent: host David Farrier\n\nOur Review: “David Farrier’s new series ‘Dark Tourist’ takes a broad categorization of unconventional global tourist destinations and approaches them with the same voyeuristic tone and format, treating a whole host of global oddities as a set of minor curiosities. The result is a slippery documentary exercise that never ends up illuminating the thing that sets out to capture in the first place, if there was a unified goal for these expeditions all in the first place.” — Steve Greene\n\n“Welcome to the Family”\n\nRelease Date: July 27\n\nNumber of Episodes: 13\n\nNetflix expanded its reach even farther, bringing in this dark Catalan comedy about a single mother hiding the death of her father after learning he had left her out of his will.
