        "text": "If you seat John first, he sits on the end with probability $\\frac 27$ then Mary has $\\frac 56$ chance not to sit next to him, or he sits in the middle with probability $\\frac 57$ and Mary has $\\frac 46$ chance not to sit next to him. $$\\frac 27 \\cdot \\frac 56+\\frac 57 \\cdot \\frac46=\\frac {30}{42}=\\frac 57$$\n\nIn the rest of your computation you are not considering order, so you shouldn't for JM either.\n\nHave John and Mary \"reserve\" a pair of seats. There are ${7\\choose2}=21$ pairs possible, $6$ of which are side by side. So if they make a reservation at random, the probability they'll wind up sitting apart is\n\n$$1-{6\\over{7\\choose2}}=1-{6\\over21}={5\\over7}$$\n\nAlternatively, have John and the five others go stand in a row near the chairs. Then, before anyone sits down, have Mary come join them, inserting herself either between two people or at one of the two ends. There are $7$ places Mary can insert herself, only $2$ of which are next to John, so the probability Mary and John wind up sitting apart is $5/7$. (This is essentially the same answer at true blue anil's, mostly just expressed in story form.)\n\nThe number of ways with MJ or JM is $2 \\cdot \\,^6C_1 \\cdot \\,^5P_5$.\n\nThe total number of ways is $\\,^7P_7$.\n\nHence the required probability is $$1 -\\frac{2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5!}{7!} = 1 -\\frac{2 \\cdot 6!}{7!} = 1 - \\frac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$$\n\n$\\dfrac{6\\cdot5}{6\\cdot7} = \\dfrac57\\quad$ Logic ?\n\nDepicting the $2$ \"specials\" and the $5$ \"others\" as red /white balls respectively,\n\nThe first red can always be placed anywhere in $6$ ways with the whites,\n\ne.g. ${\\Large\\circ\\circ\\circ\\circ\\color{red}{\\bullet}\\circ}$\n\nbut wherever you place it, the second red has only $5$ authorised places\n\ne.g. $\\;{\\Large\\uparrow\\circ\\uparrow\\circ\\uparrow\\circ\\uparrow\\circ\\color{red}\\bullet\\circ\\uparrow}\\;$ against $7$ unconstrained places,\n\nthus $Pr = \\dfrac{6\\cdot5}{6\\cdot7} = \\dfrac57$\n\nSee the total ways are $7! $ now let $jm $ be one guy (not biologically) just assume. So now we have total $1+5=6$ ways. We can now arrange these as $6! $ and these two persons can be arranged within themselves in $2! $ thus total ways where they sit together are $2!.6! $hence probability that they wont sit together$=\\frac {7!-2!6!}{7!}=1-\\frac {2}{7}=\\frac {5}{7} $\n\nI just spotted the mistake. I should have done either:\n\n$$1-(6\\cdot(\\frac{2}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6})) = \\frac{5}{7}$$\n\nor\n\n$$1-(6\\cdot2\\cdot(\\frac{1}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6})) = \\frac{5}{7}$$\n\nbecause $2\\cdot(\\frac{1}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}) = \\frac{2}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nI thought about the following: We have to find the total number of arrangements without restrictions and then we find the total number of arrangements where John and Mary sit together. This is the probability they sit together. This gives: JM together: $=2×6!$, No res. $=7!$\n\n$\\frac{2×6!}{7!}$ gives $\\frac{2}{7}$ thus the probability they do not sit together is $\\frac{5}{7}$\n\nSo the overall number of sitting options is $7!$, I think nobody can argue over this.\n\nWLOG let's say we're sitting everybody left to right:\n\nLet MJ (Mary sitting left to John) be a sitting block, then the number of possible sitting options on this case is $6!$\n\nLet JM be the complementary block (i.e Mary sitting right to John), these are totally different $6!$ options.\n\nTogether we've got $2\\cdot 6!$ options where Mary and John sit together during the movie, which gives us probability of $\\frac{2\\cdot6!}{7!}=\\frac{2\\cdot6!}{7\\cdot6!}=\\frac{2}{7}$ for the event of Mary and John making out.\n\nThe complementary probability (i.e 'wait patiently till you get to your room') will be $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\frac{5}{7}$. Voilà!\n\nThe reason your solution didn't quite work is that you assumed that there is only one seat that the John can sit on if Mary sits first, or vice versa if John sits first. This is shown by the product $\\frac{2}{7}\\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$ in your solution. This doesn't work, because there are cases where there are two seats next to John in which Mary can sit on. You must use casework if you approach the problem the way you did.\n\nThe best way to do this is to consider the total number of permutations that are successful for both the desired cases and total cases rather than to approach it by straight probabilities.\n\nDoing this, there are $7!$ ways for everyone to sit however they choose. To use complimentary counting, consider all the ways Mary and Jane can sit together, so there are $2!(6!)$. The probability is thus $$\\frac{7! - 6!(2!)}{7!} = \\frac{5}{7}.$$\n\nThere are 6 places where they can sit together: (this is 7-2+1 for generalisation)\n\nFor each place, either John or Mary can sit on the left ($2$ ways) and each of the other 5 can sit in any order ($5!$ ways).\n\nThus there are $6*2*5! = 2*6!$ ways for John and Mary to sit together.\n\nThere are $7!$ permutations in total, thus the probability of sitting together is $\\frac{2*6!}{7!} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nThus the probability of not sitting together is $1-\\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nFive seats have $2$ neighbour seats and two seats have $1$ neighbour seat.\n\nHence each person sits with $\\frac{5\\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 1}{7} = \\frac{12}{7}$ persons on average. Now there are $6$ other persons than Mary, so the probability that she sits with John is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{12}{7} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nAdd another seat to the arrangement making it a circle, and place the cinema owner in that seat. Then Mary and John sit next to eachother with probability $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nAssume that Mary is the last to arrive. There are 7 positions where she can insert herself into the row. Two of those positions are next to John, no matter where he is sitting. So if she chooses a position randomly, the probability she will sit next to John is 2/7.\n\nEasier to think about it by first calculating the probability that they WILL sit together\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Seven seats J 0 0 0 0 0 0 (1/6) 0 0 0 0 0 0 J (1/6) 0 0 0 J 0 0 0 (2/6) * 5 ((2/6) * 5 + (1/6) * 2) / 7 Final answer: 1 - ((2/6) * 5 + (1/6) * 2) / 7) = 1 - ((10/6 + 2/6) / 7) = 1 - ((12/6) / 7) = 1 - (2/7) = 5/7"
