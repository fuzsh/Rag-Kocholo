Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulianne Moore plays the scheming Mary Villiers, who wants to make hers the most powerful family in England.\n\nWhen audiences first meet Mary Villiers, she's in a precarious position; newly widowed and soon-to-be penniless, she hastily arranges to remarry a wealthy knight.\n\nIt is the start of Mary's plan to rise through 17th-century English society. She's also pinned her hopes on her second son, George, who, with his preternatural good looks, she thinks can \"rule the fucking planet.\"\n\nMoore has many memorable performances on both the big and small screen, including \"The Big Lebowski,\" \"Crazy Stupid Love,\" \"The Hours,\" and \"A Single Man.\" She was most recently seen in the Netflix film \"May December.\" She won an Oscar in 2014 for her role in \"Still Alice.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary's beautiful son, George Villiers, is played by Nicholas Galitzine.\n\nGeorge is molded by his mother into a refined but cunning young gentleman whom King James won't be able to resist. He is invited into the monarch's court and, eventually, into his bed chamber.\n\nBut as George grows accustomed to life inside the palace walls, his relationship with his mother is pushed to the limits and the two turn on each other.\n\nGalitzine is a fast-rising star in Hollywood. The 29-year-old actor has featured in a string of popular projects in the last few years, including \"Red, White & Royal Blue,\" \"Purple Hearts,\" \"Bottoms,\" and \"Cinderella.\" He stars opposite Anne Hathaway in the upcoming romantic drama, \"The Idea of You.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlaying the impulsive King James is Scottish actor Tony Curran.\n\nKing James's sexual liaisons with the young, beautiful men he surrounds himself with is an open secret in the royal court. So much so that when George catches the King's eye, many see it as an opportunity to displace his current favorite.\n\nThe Scottish actor playing King James was seen most recently in the Disney+ series, \"Secret Invasion,\" but is perhaps most recognizable to viewers for his performance as tortured artist Vincent Van Gogh in a 2010 episode of \"Doctor Who.\" Curran has also appeared in the second season of the Bryan Cranston-led series, \"Your Honour\" and \"Ray Donovan,\" and the film, \"Calibre.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaurie Davidson plays Robert Carr, the Earl of Somerset, the King's corrupt lover.\n\nSomerset knows he has the King in the palm of his hand, so when George, a beautiful young nobody, appears on the scene, he's not fazed. However, that soon changes when he realizes the real threat — George's ruthless mother.\n\nDavidson has previously appeared in the television series, \"Masters of the Air,\" \"Sandman,\" and \"Will,\" in which he played a young William Shakespeare. As for the big screen, he appeared as Mr. Mistoffolees in the much-slated musical \"Cats\" and \"The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNiamh Algar plays Sandie Brooks, an Irish brothel owner who falls in with the Villiers and helps carry out their plans.\n\nSandie is Mary's lover and confidente. As a sex worker, she is well aware that everything — and everybody — has a price, but she grows increasingly unsettled by the lengths Mary is willing to go to cement her family's position in society.\n\nAudiences may know Algar, the actor playing Sandie, from her roles in the British films \"Censor\" and \"The Wonder,\" the latter starred Florence Pugh in the lead role. Algar also appeared in the movie \"Calm With Horses\" and the fantasy television drama \"Raised by Wolves,\" both of which also starred \"Shogun\" actor Cosmo Jarvis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamuel Blenkin plays James' son and heir, Prince Charles.\n\nIndulged by his mother and ignored by his father, Charles struggles with the weight of expectation as the future king of England and Scotland. He's also incredibly resentful of the male favorites, such as George, who wheedle their way into his father's life and affections.\n\nBlenkin got his start in the theatre and portrayed Scorpius Malfoy in the original West End Palace Theatre production of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" in 2017.\n\nHe may also be a familiar face to fans of the Netflix fantasy series, \"The Witcher: Blood Origin.\" In the series, which serves as a prequel to the highly successful main series \"The Witcher,\" Blenkin portrayed the elf Avallac'h. In the streamer's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's \"The Sandman,\" he portrayed the famous playwright William Shakespeare. Blenkin has also appeared in \"Black Mirror,\" \"Peaky Blinders,\" and \"Atlanta.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicola Walker plays Lady Hatton, a noblewoman who looks down on the Villiers.\n\nLady Hatton is the formidable wife of Sir Edward Coke (Adrian Rawlins). She not only holds the family purse strings, but she's also deadset against her husband's plans to marry off their daughter to the socially inferior Villiers family.\n\nWalker is well known for her work on British television, having appeared in many UK procedural dramas, including \"Unforgotten,\" \"Scott & Bailey,\" and \"Spooks.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPortraying the politically ambitious Sir Francis Bacon is Mark O'Halloran.\n\nLike others in King James' court, Sir Francis Bacon's interest is piqued when he learns that another beautiful young man on the scene could oust the increasingly powerful Somerset from his role as the King's right-hand man. Like Mary, he wants to use George as his pawn in this political chess game.\n\nIrish actor O'Halloran's work has spanned across film, television, and theatre and he is best known in the UK and Ireland. He starred in the 2004 film \"Adam and Paul,\" which he wrote and was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. Other roles include the TV series \"Brassic\" and the movies \"The Guard\" and \"Calvary.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlaying Queen Anne, the wife of King James, is Trine Dyrholm.\n\nThe daughter of the Danish king, Frederick II, Anne's match to King James took place over two decades before the events of \"Mary & George.\" She's aware of her husband's sexual behavior and only takes issue with the undue influence Somerset appears to have over him. She conspires with Mary Villiers and clears the path for George to replace Somerset.\n\nDyrholm, who has been perfectly cast in the role as an actor of Danish descent herself, is no stranger to period pieces. She has appeared in the films \"Margrete: Queen of the North\" and \"Erna at War.\" Audiences may also recognize her from the movie \"Love Is All You Need,\" where she appeared opposite Pierce Brosnan.\n\n\"Mary & George\" airs Fridays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Starz.\n\nRead next\n\nTelevision\n\nAdvertisement"
