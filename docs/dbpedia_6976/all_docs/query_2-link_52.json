        "text": "Motion pictures have enticed and inspired artists, audiences, and critics for more than a century. Today, we’re going to explore the history of film by looking at the major movements that have defined cinema worldwide. We’re also going to explore the technical craft of filmmaking from the persistence of vision to colorization to synchronous sound. By the end, you’ll know all the broad strokes in the history of film.\n\nNote: this article doesn’t cover every piece of film history. Some minor movements and technical breakthroughs have been left out – check out the StudioBinder blog for more content.\n\nWhen Were Movies Invented?\n\nPre-Film Techniques and Theory\n\nMovies refer to moving pictures and moving pictures can be traced all the way back to prehistoric times. Have you ever made a shadow puppet show? If you have, then you’ve made a moving picture.\n\nTo create a moving picture with your hands is one thing, to utilize a device is another. The camera obscura (believed to have been circulated in the fifth century BCE) is perhaps the oldest photographic device in existence. The camera obscura is a device that’s used to reproduce images by reflecting light through a small peephole.\n\nHere’s a picture of one from Gemma Frisius’ 1545 book De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica:\n\nWhen Did Movies Start? • Camera Obscura in ‘De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica’\n\nThrough the camera obscura, we can trace the principles of filmmaking back thousands of years. But despite the technical achievement of the camera obscura, it took many of those years to develop the technology needed to capture moving images then later display them.\n\nWhen Was Film Invented?\n\nThe First Motion Pictures\n\nWhen were movies invented? The first motion pictures were incredibly simple – usually just a few frames of people or animals. Eadweard Muybridge’s The Horse in Motion is perhaps the most famous of these early motion pictures. In 1878, Muybridge set up a racing track with 24 cameras to photograph whether horses gallop with all four hooves off the ground at any time\n\nThe result was sensational. Muybridge’s pictures set the stage for all coming films; check out a short video on Muybridge and his work below.\n\nWhen Did the First Movie Come Out? • Eadweard Muybridge’s ‘The Horse in Motion’ by San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\n\nMuybridge’s job wasn’t done after taking the photographs though; he still had to produce a projection machine to display them. So, Muybridge built a device called the zoopraxiscope, which was regarded as a breakthrough device for motion picture projecting.\n\nMuybridge’s films (and tech) inspired Thomas Edison to study motion picture theory and develop his own camera equipment.\n\nFilms as we know them today emerged globally around the turn of the century, circa 1900. Much of that development can be attributed to the works of the Lumière Brothers, who together pioneered the technical craft of moviemaking with their cinematograph projection machine. The Lumière Brothers’ 1895 shorts are regarded as the first commercial films of all-time; though not technically true (remember Muybridge’s work).\n\nFrench actor and illusionist Georges Méliès attempted to buy a cinematograph from the Lumière Brothers in 1895, but was denied. So, Méliès ventured elsewhere; eventually finding a partner in Englishman Robert W. Paul.\n\nOver the following years, Méliès learned just about everything there was to know about movies and projection machines. Here’s a video on Méliès’ master of film and the illusory arts from Crash Course Film History.\n\nWhen Were Movies Invented? • Georges Méliès – Master of Illusion by Crash Course\n\nMéliès’ shorts The One Man Band (1900) and A Trip to the Moon (1902) are considered two of the most trailblazing films in all of film history. Over the course of his career, Méliès produced over 500 films. His contemporary mastery of visual effects, multiple exposure, and cinematography made him one of the greatest filmmakers of all-time.\n\nMovie History\n\nThe First Film Movements\n\nWar and cinema go together like two peas in a pod. As we continue on through our analysis of the history of film, you’ll start to notice that just about every major movement sprouted in the wake of war. First, the movements that sprouted in response to World War I:\n\nDADAISM AND SURREALISM\n\nHistory of Motion Pictures • Still From ‘Un Chien Andalou’ by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí\n\nMajor Dadaist filmmakers: Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dalí, Germaine Dulac.\n\nMajor Dadaist films: Return to Reason (1923), The Seashell and the Clergyman (1928), Un Chien Andalou (1929).\n\nDadaism – an art movement that began in Zurich, Switzerland during World War I (1915) – rejected authority; effectively laying the groundwork for surrealist cinema.\n\nDadaism may have begun in Zurich circa 1915, but it didn’t take off until years later in Paris, France. By 1920, the people of France had expressed a growing disillusionment with the country’s government and economy. Sound familiar?\n\nThat’s because they’re the same points of conflict that incited the French Revolution. But this time around, the French people revolted in a different way: with art. And not just any art: bonkers, crazy, absurd, anti-this, anti-that art.\n\nIt’s important to note that Paris wasn’t the only place where dadaist art was being created. But it was the place where most of the dadaist, surrealist film was being created. We’ll get to dadaist film in a short bit, but first, let’s review a quick video on Dada art from Curious Muse.\n\nWhere Did Film Originate? • Dadaism in 8 Minutes by Curious Muse\n\nSalvador Dalí, Germaine Dulac, and Luis Buñuel were some of the forefront faces of the surrealist film movement of the 1920s. French filmmakers, such as Jean Epstein and Jean Renoir experimented with surrealist films during this era as well.\n\nDalí and Buñuel’s 1929 film Un Chien Andalou is undoubtedly one of the most influential surrealist/dadaist films. Let’s check out a clip:\n\nHistory of Movies • ‘Un Chien Andalou’ Clip\n\nThe influence of Un Chien Andalou on surrealist cinema can’t be quantified; key similarities can be seen between the film and the works of Walt Disney, David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and other surrealist directors.\n\nLearn more about surrealism in film →\n\nGERMAN EXPRESSIONISM\n\nThe Creation of Film and German Expressionism • Still From ‘The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari’ by Robert Wiene\n\nGerman Expressionism – an art movement defined by monumentalist structures and ideas – began before World War I but didn’t take off in popularity until after the war, much like the Dadaist movement.\n\nMajor German Expressionist filmmakers: Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau, Robert Wiene\n\nMajor German Expressionist films: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), Nosferatu (1922), and Metropolis (1927).\n\nGerman Expressionism changed everything for the “look” and “feel” of cinema. When you think of German Expressionism, think contrast, gothic, dark, brooding imagery and colored filters. Here’s a quick video on the German Expressionist movement from Crash Course:\n\nHistory of Film Timeline • German Expressionism Explained\n\nThe great works of the German Expressionist movement are some of the earliest movies I consider accessible to modern audiences. Perhaps no German Expressionist film proves this point better than Fritz Lang’s M; which was the ultimate culmination of the movement’s stylistic tenets. Check out the trailer for M below.\n\nMost Important Film in History of German Expressionism • ‘M’ (1931) Trailer, Restored by BFI\n\nM not only epitomized the “monster” tone of the German Expressionist era, it set the stage for all future psychological thrillers. The film also pioneered sound engineering in film through the clever use of diegetic and non-diegetic sound. Fun fact: it was also one of the first movies to incorporate a leitmotif as part of its soundtrack.\n\nOver time, the stylistic flourishes of the German Expressionist movement gave way to new voices – but its influence lived on in monster-horror and chiaroscuro lighting techniques.\n\nLearn more about German Expressionism →\n\nSOVIET MONTAGE THEORY\n\nFilm History 101 • The Odessa Steps in ‘Battleship Potemkin’\n\nSoviet Montage Theory – a Soviet Russian film movement that helped establish the principles of film editing – took place from the 1910s to the 1930s.\n\nMajor Soviet Montage Theory filmmakers: Lev Kuleshov, Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov.\n\nMajor Soviet Montage Theory films: Kino-Eye (1924), Battleship Potemkin (1925), Man With a Movie Camera (1929).\n\nSoviet Montage Theory was a deconstructionist film movement, so as to say it wasn’t as interested in making movies as it was taking movies apart… or seeing how they worked. That being said, Soviet Montage Theory did produce some classics.\n\nHere’s a video on Soviet Montage Theory from Filmmaker IQ:\n\nEras of Movies • The History of Cutting in Soviet Montage Theory by Filmmaker IQ\n\nThe Bolshevik government set-up a film school called VGIK (the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography) after the Russian Revolution. The practitioners of Soviet Montage Theory were the OG members of the “film school generation;” Kuleshov and Eisenstein were their teachers.\n\nBattleship Potemkin was the most noteworthy film to come out of the Soviet Montage Theory movement. Check out an awesome analysis from One Hundred Years of Cinema below.\n\nHistory of Film Summary • How Sergei Eisenstein Used Montage to Film the Unfilmable by One Hundred Years of Cinema\n\nSoviet Montage Theory begged filmmakers to arrange, deconstruct, and rearrange film clips to better communicate emotional associations to audiences. The legacy of Soviet Montage Theory lives on in the form of the Kuleshov effect and contemporary montages.\n\nLearn more about Soviet Montage Theory →\n\nWhen Did Movies Become Popular?\n\nThe End of the Silent Era\n\nThere was no Hollywood in the early years of American cinema – there was only Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey.\n\nEver wonder why Europe seemed to dominate the early years of film? Well it was because Thomas Edison sued American filmmakers into oblivion. Edison owned a litany of U.S. patents on camera tech – and he wielded his stamps of ownership with righteous fury. The Edison Manufacturing Company did produce some noteworthy early films – such as 1903’s The Great Train Robbery – but their gaps were few and far between.\n\nTo escape Edison’s legal monopoly, filmmakers ventured west, all the way to Southern California.\n\nFortunate for the nomads: the arid temperature and mountainous terrain of Southern California proved perfect for making movies. By the early 1910s, Hollywood emerged as the working capital of the United States’s movie industry.\n\nDirector/actors like Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton became stars – but remember, movies were silent, and people knew there would be an acoustic revolution in cinema. Before we move on from the Silent Era, check out this great video from Crash Course.\n\nWhen Did Movies Become Popular? • The Silent Era by Crash Course\n\nThe Silent Era holds an important place in film history – but it was mostly ushered out in 1927 with The Jazz Singer. Al Jolson singing in The Jazz Singer is considered the first time sound ever synchronized with a feature film. Over the next few years, Hollywood cinema exploded in popularity. This short period from 1927-1934 is known as pre-Code Hollywood.\n\nWhen Did Hollywood Start?\n\nPre-Code Hollywood\n\nIn our previous section, we touched on the rise of Hollywood, but not the Hollywood epic. The Hollywood epic, which we regard as longer in duration and wider in scope than the average movie, set the stage for blockbuster cinema. So, let’s quickly touch on the history of Hollywood epics before jumping into pre-code Hollywood.\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Hollywood epics without bringing up D.W. Griffith. Griffith was an American film director who created a lot of what we consider “the structure” of feature films. His 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation brought the technique of cinematic storytelling into the future, while consequently keeping its subject matter in the objectionable past.\n\nFor more on Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation (and its complicated legacy), check out this poignant interview clip with Spike Lee.\n\nHistory of Filmmaking • Spike Lee on ‘The Birth of a Nation’\n\nAs Lee suggests, it’s important to acknowledge the technical achievement of films like The Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind without condoning their horrid subject matter.\n\nAs another great director once said: “tomorrow’s democracy discriminates against discrimination. Its charter won’t include the freedom to end freedom.” – Orson Welles.\n\nGriffith made more than a few Hollywood epics in his time, but none were more famous than The Birth of a Nation.\n\nOkay, now that we reviewed the foundations of the Hollywood epic, let’s move on to pre-code Hollywood.\n\nPRE-CODE HOLLYWOOD\n\nA History of Film • James Cagney in ‘The Public Enemy’\n\nPre-Code Hollywood – a period in Hollywood history after the advent of sound but before the institution of the Hays Code – circa ~1927-1934.\n\nMajor Pre-Code stars: Ruth Chatterton, Warren William, James Cagney.\n\nMajor Pre-Code films: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), The Public Enemy (1931), Baby Face (1933).\n\nPre-Code Hollywood was wild. Not just wild in an uninhibited sense, but in a thematic sense too. Films produced during the pre-Code era often focused on illicit subject matter, like bootlegging, prostitution, and murder – that wasn't the status quo for Hollywood – and it wouldn’t be again until 1968.\n\nWe’ll get to why that year is important for film history in a bit, but first let’s review pre-Code Hollywood with a couple of selected scenes from Kevin Wentink on YouTube.\n\nMovie Film History • Pre-Code Classic Clips\n\nPre-Code movies were jubilant in their creativity; largely because they were uncensored. But alas, their period was short-lived. In 1934, MPPDA Chairman William Hays instituted the Motion Picture Production Code banning explicit depictions of sex, violence, and other “sinful” deeds in movies.\n\nLearn more about Pre-Code Hollywood →\n\nDevelopment of Movies\n\nThe Early Golden Age and Color in Film\n\nThe 1930s and early 1940s produced some of the greatest movies of all-time – but they also changed everything about the movie-making process. By the end of the Pre-Code era, the free independent spirit of filmmaking had all but evaporated; Hollywood studios had vertically integrated their business operations, which meant they conceptualized, produced, and distributed everything “in-house.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean movies made during these years were bad though. Quite the contrary – perhaps the two greatest American films ever made, Citizen Kane and Casablanca, were made between 1934 and 1944.\n\nBut despite their enormous influence, neither Citizen Kane nor Casablanca could hold a candle to the influence of another film from this decade: The Wizard of Oz.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz wasn’t the first film to use Technicolor, but it was credited with bringing color to the masses. For more on the industry-altering introduction of color, check out this video on The Wizard of Oz from Vox.\n\nWhen Was Color Movies Invented? • How Technicolor Changed Movies\n\nTechnicolor was groundbreaking for cinema, but the dye-transfer process of its colorization was hard… and cost prohibitive for studios. So, camera manufacturers experimented with new processes to streamline color photography. Overtime, they were rewarded with new technologies and techniques.\n\nLearn more about Technicolor →\n\nCinema Eras\n\nWartime and Propaganda Films\n\nIn 1937, Benito Mussolini founded Cinecittà, a massive studio that operated under the slogan “Il cinema è l'arma più forte,” which translates to “the cinema is the strongest weapon.” During this time, countries all around the world used cinema as a weapon to influence the minds and hearts of their citizens.\n\nThis was especially true in the United States – prolific directors like Frank Capra, John Ford, John Huston, George Stevens, and William Wyler enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces to make movies to support the U.S. war cause.\n\nDocumentarian Laurent Bouzereau made a three-part series about the war films of Capra, Ford, Huston, Stevens, and Wyler. Check out the trailer for Five Came Back below.\n\nA History of Film • Five Came Back Trailer\n\nWartime film is important to explore because it teaches us about how people interpret propaganda. For posterity’s sake, let’s define propaganda as biased information that’s used to promote political points.\n\nPropaganda films are often regarded with a negative connotation because they sh0w a one-sided perspective. Films of this era – such as those commissioned for the US Department of War’s Why We Fight series – were one-sided because they were made to counter the enemy’s rhetoric. It’s important to note that “one-sided” doesn’t mean “wrong” – in the case of the Why We Fight series, I think most people would agree that the one-sidedness was appropriate.\n\nOver time, wartime film became more nuanced – a point proven by the 1966 masterwork The Battle of Algiers.\n\nHistory of Movies\n\nPost-War Film Movements\n\nGlobal cinema underwent a renaissance after World War II; technically, creatively, and conceptually. We’re going to cover a few of the most prominent post-war film movements, starting with Italian Neorealism.\n\nITALIAN NEOREALISM\n\nMovie Film History • Still from Vittorio De Sica’s ‘Umberto D.’\n\nItalian Neorealism (1944-1960) – an Italian film movement that brought filmmaking to the streets; defined by depictions of the Italian state after World War II.\n\nMajor Italian Neorealist film-makers: Vittorio De Sica, Roberto Rossellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini.\n\nMajor Italian Neorealist films: Rome, Open City (1945), Bicycle Thieves (1948), La Strada (1954), Il Posto (1961).\n\nMartin Scorcese called Italian Neorealism “the rehabilitation of an entire culture and people through cinema.” World War II devastated the Italian state: socially, economically, and culturally.\n\nIt took people’s lives and jobs, but perhaps more importantly, it took their humanity. After the War, the people needed an outlet of expression, and a place to reconstruct a new national identity. Here’s a quick video on Italian Neorealism.\n\nMovie History • How Italian Neorealism Brought the Grit of the Streets to the Big Screen by No Film School\n\nItalian Neorealism produced some of the greatest films ever made. There’s some debate as to when the movement started and ended – some say 1943-1954, others say 1945-1955 – but I say it started with Rome, Open City and ended with Il Posto. Why? Because those movies perfectly encompass the defining arc of Italian Neorealism, from street-life after World War II to the rise of bureaucracy. Rome, Open City shows Italy in the thick of chaos, and Il Posto shows Italy on the precipice of a new era.\n\nThe legacy of Italian Neorealism lives on in the independent filmmaking of directors like Richard Linklater, Steven Soderbergh, and Sean Baker.\n\nLearn more about Italian Neorealism →\n\nFRENCH NEW WAVE\n\nDevelopment of Movies • Still From Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless\n\nFrench New Wave (1950s onwards) – or La Nouvelle Rogue, a French art movement popularized by critics, defined by experimental ideas – inspired by old-Hollywood and progressive editing techniques from Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nMajor French New Wave filmmakers: Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Agnes Varda.\n\nMajor French New Wave films: The 400 Blows (1959), Breathless (1960), Cleo from 5 to 7 (1962).\n\nThe French New Wave proliferated the auteur theory, which suggests the director is the author of a movie; which makes sense considering a lot of the best French New Wave films featured minimalist narratives. Take Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless for example: the story is secondary to audio and visuals. The French New Wave was about independent filmmaking – taking a camera into the streets and making a movie by any means necessary.\n\nHere’s a quick video on The French New Wave by The Cinema Cartography.\n\nHistory of Filmmaking • Breaking the Rules With the French New Wave by The Cinema Cartography\n\nIt’s important to note that the pioneers of the French New Wave weren’t amateurs – most (but not all) were critics at Cahiers du cinéma, a respected French film magazine. Writers like Godard, Rivette, and Chabrol knew what they were doing long before they released their great works.\n\nOther directors, like Agnes Varda and Alain Resnais, were members of the Left Bank, a somewhat more traditionalist art group. Left Bank directors tended to put more emphasis on their narratives as opposed to their Cahiers du cinéma counterparts.\n\nThe French New popularized (but did not invent) innovative filmmaking techniques like jump cuts and tracking shots. The influence of the French New Wave can be seen in music videos, existentialist cinema, and French film noir.\n\nLearn more about the French New Wave →\n\nLearn more about the Best French New Wave Films →\n\nSCANDINAVIAN REVIVAL\n\nA History of Film • Still from Ingmar Bergman’s ‘The Seventh Seal’\n\nScandinavian Revival (1940s-1950s) – a filmmaking movement in Scandinavia, particularly Denmark and Sweden, defined by monochrome visuals, philosophical quandaries, and reinterpretations of religious ideals.\n\nMajor Scandinavian Revival filmmakers: Carl Theodor Dreyer and Ingmar Bergman.\n\nMajor Scandinavian Revival films: Day of Wrath (1943), The Seventh Seal (1957), Wild Strawberries (1957).\n\nSwedish, Danish, and Finnish films have played an important role in cinema for more than 100 years. The Scandinavian Revival – or renaissance of Scandinavian-centric films from the 1940s-1950s – put the films of Sweden, Denmark, and Finland in front of the world stage.\n\nHere’s a quick video on the works of the most famous Scandinavian director of all-time: Ingmar Bergman.\n\nHistory of Cinema • Ingmar Bergman’s Cinema by The Criterion Collection\n\nThe influence of Scandinavian Revival can be seen in the works of Danish directors like Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier, as well as countless other filmmakers around the world.\n\nBENGALI CINEMA\n\nHistory of Motion Pictures • Still from Satyajit Ray’s ‘Pather Panchali’\n\nBengali Cinema – or the cinema of West Bengal; also known as Tollywood, helped develop arthouse films parallel to the mainstream Indian cinema.\n\nMajor Bengali filmmakers: Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen.\n\nMajor Bengali films: Pather Panchali (1955) and Bhuvan Shome (1969).\n\nThe Indian film industry is the biggest film industry in the world. Each year, India produces more than a thousand feature-films. When most people think of Indian cinema, they think of Bollywood “song and dance” masalas – but did you know the country underwent a New Wave (similar to France, Italy, and Scandinavia) after World War II? The influence of the Indian New Wave, or classic Bengali cinema, is hard to quantify; perhaps it’s better expressed by the efforts of the Academy Film Archive, Criterion Collection, and L'Immagine Ritrovata film restoration artists. Here's an introduction to one of India's greatest directors, Satyajit Ray.\n\nEvolution of Cinema • How Satyajit Ray Directs a Movie\n\nIn 2020, Martin Scorsese said, “In the relatively short history of cinema, Satyajit Ray is one of the names that we all need to know, whose films we all need to see.” Ray is undoubtedly one of the preeminent masters of international cinema – and his name belongs in the conversation with Hitchcock, Renoir, Kurosawa, Welles, and all the other trailblazing filmmakers of the mid-20th century.\n\nLearn more about Indian Cinema →\n\nOTHER POST-WAR & NEW WAVE MOVEMENTS\n\nHow Has Film Changed Over Time? • Still from Akira Kurosawa’s ‘Stray Dog’\n\nItaly, France, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and India weren’t the only countries that underwent “New Waves” after World War II; Japan, Iran, Great Britain, and Russia had minor film revolutions as well.\n\nIn Japan, directors like Akira Kurosawa and Yasujirō Ozu introduced new filmmaking techniques to the masses; their 1940s-1950s films were great, but some filmmakers, like Hiroshi Teshigahara and Nagisa Ōshima felt they were better suited to make films about “modern” Japan.\n\nHere’s a quick video on the Japanese New Wave from Film Studies for YouTube.\n\nCinema Eras • Japanese New Wave Video Essay by Film Studies for YouTube\n\nSome cinema historians combine the Japanese New Wave with the post-war era. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll do the same: the major films of this era (1940s-1960s) include Rashomon (1950), Tokyo Story (1953), and Seven Samurai (1954).\n\nThe Iranian New Wave began about fifteen years after the end of World War II, circa 1960-onwards. Iranian cinema is an important part of Iranian culture. Here’s a quick video on Iranian cinema from BBC News.\n\nImportant Dates in Film History • Spotlight on Iran’s Film Industry via BBC News\n\nCinema historians widely consider Dariush Mehrjui’s The Cow (1969) to be a foundational film for the movement. Abbas Kiarostami is perhaps the most famous Iranian filmmaker of all-time. His film Close-Up (1990) is regarded as one of the greatest films ever produced in Iran.\n\nThe British New Wave was a minor film movement that was defined by kitchen-sink realism – or depictions of ordinary life. Many filmmakers of the British New Wave were critics before they were directors; and they wanted to depict the average life of Britain through a filmic eye.\n\nHere’s a lecture on the British New Wave from Professor Ian Christie at Gresham College.\n\nHistory of Filmmaking • Street-Life and New Wave British Cinema by Gresham College\n\nThe British New Wave became synonymous with Cinéma vérité (cinema of truth) over the course of its brief existence. Some of the major pictures of the movement include: Look Back in Anger (1959) and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960).\n\nRussian cinema is complex… probably just as complex as American cinema. We could spend 100 pages talking about Russian cinema – but that’s not the focus of this article. We already talked about Soviet Montage Theory, so let’s skip ahead to post World War II Soviet cinema.\n\nWhen I think of post-war Soviet cinema, I think of one name: Andrei Tarkovsky. Tarkovsky directed internationally-renowned films like Andrei Rublev (1969), Solaris (1972), and Stalker (1979) in his brief career as the Soviet Union’s pre-eminent maestro.\n\nHere’s a deep dive into the works of Tarkovsky by “Like Stories of Old.”\n\nFilm Industry Timeline • Praying Through Cinema – Understanding Andrei Tarkovsky by Like Stories of Old\n\nTarkovsky wasn’t the only great filmmaker in the post-war Soviet Union – but he was probably the best. I’d be remiss if I didn’t use this section to focus on him.\n\nHistory of Film Timeline\n\nThe Golden Age of Hollywood\n\nThe Hollywood Golden Age began with the fall of pre-Code Hollywood (1934) and lasted until the birth of New Hollywood (1968).\n\nMajor stars of the Hollywood Golden Age: Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Clark Gable, Ingrid Bergman, Henry Fonda, Kirk Douglas, Gregory Peck, Lauren Bacall, Grace Kelly, James Dean, Marlon Brando.\n\nMajor filmmakers of the Hollywood Golden Age: Cecil B. DeMille, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, Frank Capra, John Huston, Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Elia Kazan, David Lean, Joseph Manckiewicz.\n\nNotice how many names we included? It’s ridiculous – it would be wrong to omit any of them; and still, there are probably dozens of iconic figures missing. The Hollywood Golden Age was all about stars. Stars sold pictures and the studios knew it. “Hepburn” could sell a movie every time; it didn’t matter which Hepburn – or what the movie was about.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the Hollywood Golden Age from Crash Course.\n\nHistory of Movies • The Golden Age of Hollywood by Crash Course\n\nThere are a few sub-eras within the Hollywood Golden Age era; let’s break them down in detail.\n\nCENSORSHIP\n\nImportant Dates in Film History • Photo of MPPDA Chairman William Hays\n\nIn 1934, Chairman William Hays of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America instituted a production code that banned graphic cinematic depictions of sex, violence, and other illicit deeds.\n\nThe “Production Code” or “Hays Code” was responsible for the censorship of Hollywood films for 34 years.\n\nFor more on the history of Hollywood censorship and movie ratings, check out the video from Filmmaker IQ below.\n\nHow Has Film Changed Over Time? • History of Hollywood Censorship by Filmmaker IQ\n\nThe Hays Code kept cinema tame, which led to Hollywood romanticism. But it also made cinema unrealistic, which made the American public yearn for improbable outcomes. Not to mention that it set race relations back an indeterminable amount of years. The Hays Code specifically forbade miscegenation, or “the breeding of people of different races.”\n\nUltimately, the censorship of Hollywood films was about keeping power in the hands of people with power. It had some positive unintended outcomes – but it wasn’t worth the cost of suppression.\n\nLearn more about the Hays Code →\n\nLearn more about the history of movie censorship →\n\nFILM NOIR\n\nHow Movies Have Changed Over Time • Still from John Ford’s ‘The Searchers’\n\nHollywood westerns were incredibly popular during the Golden Age. Why? Because the American people loved stories of lawlessness and expansion, dating all the way back to Erastus Beadle’s dime novels – making the western the perfect subgenre for vicarious cinema.\n\nMajor Hollywood westerns: Stagecoach (1939), High Noon (1952), The Searchers (1956).\n\nWesterns, much like film noirs, allowed repressed audiences to feel alive at the movie theater. Remember: Hollywood films were censored during the Golden Age, which meant you couldn’t find graphic violence or pornography at the theaters. So, audiences took what they could get – which was usually film noirs and Westerns.\n\nHere’s a video on the history of Westerns in Hollywood cinema.\n\nEvolution of Film • Western Movies History by Ministry of Cinema\n\nHollywood westerns inspired a global fascination with cowboys, mercenaries, and gunslingers, directly leading to samurai cinema, spaghetti westerns, zapata westerns, and neo-westerns.\n\nLearn more about Spaghetti Westerns →\n\nLearn more about Neo-Westerns →\n\nMcCARTHYISM & THE BLACKLIST\n\nHow Movies Have Changed Over Time • Bryan Cranston as Blacklisted Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo\n\nIn 1947, the state of Wisconsin elected notorious fear-monger Joseph McCarthy as senator of their state. McCarthy hated free-speech – that’s not a one-sided perspective, that’s the truth. McCarthy spent his entire career demagoguing, and his legacy shows that.\n\nIn 1950, ten Hollywood screenwriters were summoned to appear before the United States Congress House of Un-American Activities, largely because of McCarthy's divisive rhetoric against communist sympathizers. The screenwriters were cited for contempt of congress and fired from their jobs, and thus, the blacklist was born.\n\nFor more on McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist, check out the video from Ted-Ed below.\n\nThe History of Film • McCarthyism and the Blacklist by Ted-Ed\n\nThe Hollywood blacklist derailed the careers of hundreds of writers, directors, and producers from 1950-1960. The blacklist ended when Kirk Douglas credited Dalton Trumbo – one of the most famous blacklisted screenwriters – as the screenwriter of Stanley Kubrick’s Spartacus, effectively taking back control of Hollywood.\n\nLearn more about the Hollywood Blacklist →\n\nTHE PARAMOUNT CASE\n\nThe History of Film • Paramount Studios Classic Style Logo\n\nIn 1948, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the five major motion picture studios: Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, and RKO violated the U.S. Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.\n\nAs a result of the decision, movie studios could no longer solely create and distribute movies to their own theaters.\n\nIt may not sound important, but the Paramount Case changed everything for American cinema. Here’s a quick video on the Case and its lasting impact on Hollywood.\n\nThe History of Filmmaking • Film History 101: The Paramount Decree by Omar Rivera\n\nThe Paramount Case opened the door for international films and independent theaters. It also gave businesses more freedom to show movies outside of the MPPDA ratings system.\n\nEvolution of Cinema\n\nNew Hollywood\n\nMovie History • Still from Arthur Penn’s’ Bonnie and Clyde’\n\nNew Hollywood, otherwise known as the Hollywood New Wave, introduced “the film school generation” to Hollywood. New Hollywood films are defined as larger in scope, darker in subject matter, and overtly more graphic than their Golden Age predecessors.\n\nMajor New Hollywood filmmakers: George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Peter Bogdanovich, Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron.\n\nMajor New Hollywood films: Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Graduate (1967), Easy Rider (1969), Midnight Cowboy (1969), The Godfather (1972), American Graffiti (1973).\n\nNew Hollywood ushered American filmmaking into a new era by returning to the popular genres of the pre-Code era, such as gangster films and sex-centric films. It also marked the emergence of “film-school” directors like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese. It’s clear from watching New Hollywood films that the writers and directors who produced them were acutely aware of cinema history.\n\nDuring this era, writers like Woody Allen employed themes of existentialist cinema found in the French New Wave and Italian Neorealism (among other movements). Directors like Martin Scorsese utilized advanced framing techniques pioneered by masters of the pre-war era.\n\nFor more on New Hollywood, check out this feature documentary based Peter Biskind's seminal book \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.\"\n\nMovie History • How New Hollywood Was Born\n\nNew Hollywood (and its immediate aftermath) produced some of the greatest films of all-time: such as The Godfather (1972), The Godfather Part II (1974), Chinatown (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), Network (1976), and Annie Hall (1977).\n\nSomewhat tragically, New Hollywood ended with the emergence of blockbuster films – such as Jaws (1975) and Star Wars (1977) – in the mid to late 1970s.\n\nLearn more about New Hollywood →\n\nEras of Movies\n\nDogme 95 and Independent Movements\n\nBig-budget movies dominated the movie-scene after New Hollywood ended. Suddenly, cinema became more of a spectacle than an art-form. That’s not to say movies produced during this era (1975-1995) were bad – some big-budget films, like Back to the Future (1985) and Jurassic Park (1993) were financially successful and critically acclaimed; and writer/directors like John Hughes found enormous success making studio films about seemingly mundane life.\n\nBut despite the financial prospect of making contrived studio films, some filmmakers decided to go back to their roots and make films independently, much in the vein of the artists of the French New Wave. This spirit inspired the Danish Dogme 95 movement and the American Independent movement.\n\nDOGME 95\n\nEvolution of Film • Photo Still from ‘Festen’ by Thomas Vinterberg\n\nD0gme 95 – a Danish film movement that brought filmmaking back to its primal roots: no non-diegetic sound, no superficial action, and no director credit.\n\nMajor Dogme 95 filmmakers: Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier\n\nMajor Dogme 95 films: Dogme #1 – Festen (1998), Dogme #2 – The Idiots (1998), Dogme #12 – Italian for Beginners (2000).\n\nIt’s ironic that Dogme 95, which states the director must not be credited, is perhaps best known for the fame of two of its founders: Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier. Dogme 95 sought to rid cinema of extravagant special effects and challenging productions by making the filmmaking process as simple as possible. To do this, its founders created the Vows of Chastity: a ten-part manifesto for Dogme 95 filmmaking.\n\nCheck out a video on the Vows of Chastity and Dogme 95 below.\n\nHistory of Cinema • Vows of Chastity – Films of Dogme 95 by FilmStruck\n\nUltimately, the Vows of Chastity proved too limiting for filmmakers – but their influence lives on in New Danish cinema and independent films all over the world.\n\nLearn more about Dogme 95 →\n\nINDIE FILM\n\nHistory of Cinema • Still from Kevin Smith’s ‘Clerks’\n\nIndie film – or late 80s, early 90s cinema produced outside of the major motion picture system – was about experimenting with new cinematic forms, pushing the Generation Next agenda, and making art by any means necessary.\n\nMajor indie filmmakers: Richard Linklater, Wes Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, Jim Jarmusch.\n\nMajor indie films: Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989), Slacker (1990), and Bottle Rocket (1994).\n\nThe American indie movement launched the careers of a myriad of great directors. It also marked the beginning of a major decline for film. The advent of digital cameras and DVDs meant film was becoming a luxury. Conversely, it meant procuring the necessary equipment needed to make movies was easier than ever.\n\nIndie-films introduced the idea that anybody could make movies. For better or worse, the point proved to be true. The '90s and early 2000s were littered with independently produced, scarcely funded movies. It was unrestrained, but it was also liberating.\n\nCheck out this video on no-budget filmmaking from The Royal Ocean Film Society to learn more about the indie movement.\n\nEvolution of Cinema • Lessons for the No-Budget Feature by The Royal Ocean Film Society\n\nThe indie movement (as it was known then) ended when the major studios (like Disney and Turner) bought the independent studios (like Miramax and New Line). Today, we often refer to minimalist, low-budget movies as independent, but the truth is just about every production studio is owned by a conglomerate.\n\nHow Has the Film Industry Changed?\n\nNew Distribution Methods\n\nThe current state of cinema is in flux due to a wide array of issues, including (but not limited to) the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the wide-adoption of new streaming services from first-party producers, i.e. Netflix, Disney, Paramount, etc., and the growth of new media forms.\n\nOver the last few years, big-budget epics like Marvel’s The Avengers and Star Wars have performed well at the U.S. and Chinese box-office, but their success has often come at the expense of medium-budget movies; the result being a deeper lining of the pockets of exorbitantly wealthy corporations.\n\nStill, there’s a lot of money to be made – a point perhaps best proven by the rise of the Chinese film industry. In 2020, China overtook North America as the world’s biggest box-office market, per THR. Check out a video on Hengdian, China’s largest film studio from South China Morning Report.\n\nMovie History • Inside China’s Largest Film Studio by South China Morning Report\n\nMovies seem to get bigger and bigger every year but the development of computer-generated-imagery and compositing techniques has given filmmakers the technology to create vast worlds in limited spaces.\n\nSo: what’s next for film? Who’s to say for certain? The future of the industry looks cloudy – but there’s definite promise on the horizon. More people have cinema-capable cameras in their pocket today than ever before. Perhaps the next great movement will take off soon.\n\nUp Next\n\n100 Years of Cinematography\n\nThe history of film includes a lot more than what we went over here. In 2019, the American Society of Cinematographers celebrated 100 years of great cinematography with a list of legendary works.
