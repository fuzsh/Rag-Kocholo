        "text": "Can I host the movie if I live outside North America?\n\nIgnatius Press owns North American rights for Mary of Nazareth. As a result, it is not possible to authorize distribution or host screenings outside of the U.S. and Canada. We are grateful for the strong international interest. Thank you and God Bless!\n\nCan we show this movie in our parish hall?\n\nAbsolutely! You can show this beautiful film on the âBig Screenâ in your own parish or school hall. You will be able to show this movie as many times as you wish for the full 30 days of your site license and you will be able to purchase additional Mary DVDs at a discount to have for sale at your screening events â a great time when customers will be most interested in purchasing a copy of the DVD for themselves and for gifts!\n\nWhy do I need a Site License to show this movie in my parish?\n\nDVDs are licensed for home use only. The Federal Copyright Act (Title 17 of the U.S. Code) governs how copyrighted materials, such as movies, may be used. Neither the rental nor the purchase of a copy of a copyrighted work carries with it the right to publicly exhibit the work. It is illegal to show this Mary of Nazareth movie and other DVDs in a public setting, such as a church, school or organizationâs hall, without a Site License. This applies even if you are not charging for admission. For more information and to obtain a Site License, please contact Diane at dhanson@ignatius.com, direct at 734-455-1973 or toll free at 1-866-431-1531 x 5.\n\nAre we required to sell tickets for our parish screenings?\n\nNo. You can offer the screening(s) for free if you wish. You can also certainly sell tickets if you would like to and charge whatever you think is appropriate. Some hosts ask for a free-will offering. These are your events to organize as you wish.\n\nHow do we get additional tickets and posters?\n\nThere are digital versions on the www.IPMovieNights.com website that you can print yourself.\n\nCan I buy this movie on DVD?\n\nYes. It is available at ignatius.com here. As a Movie Night host, you can purchase this film at a discount and with free shipping. Please go to www.IPMovieNights.com for more information.\n\nIs this movie suitable for children?\n\nThis movie is not suitable for very young children. Although it is not rated, we would probably rate it a PG. Parental Guidance is advised. We would not advise viewing for children younger than pre-teens (11 and 12) and teens, but even so, parents should be aware that there are some scenes that might be too intense for their children, such as the murder of the innocents by King Herod as well as the crucifixion scenes.\n\nCan we purchase a package and have screenings at other parishes or schools in addition to our own?\n\nNo, you cannot. Because you are purchasing a âSITEâ License, you are restricted to showing your movie only at your own facility. If other parishes, schools or groups wish to show the film, they should contact Ignatius Press for information on purchasing their own Site License.\n\nWhat if we want to show this movie in a theater?\n\nIt is still possible to show this movie in a theater. However, there is an additional cost to rent the theater format from Ignatius Press and the host is also responsible for renting a theater for their screening. For further information, contact Diane Hanson."
