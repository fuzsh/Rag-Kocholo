        "text": "\"JOHN AND MARY\" stars Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow as the sort of unattached New Yorkers who frequent singles bars, decorate their walls with pop-posters, stand in line outside the Sutton Theater, possess paperback books of poetry (probably unread), and, in general, find themselves full of muted desperation, imprisoned by the new First Avenue morality that has supposedly liberated them.The film, which opened yesterday at the Sutton, seems quite right on its outside. It was shot in Manhattan (at Friday's, on Riverside Drive, in Murray Hill) and it is paced by the latest cinematic clichés — sudden cuts to flashbacks and fantasies, usually designed as comic punctuation marks to present pretensions. If you look at it closely, however, you see the structure of an old Fred MacMurray-Claudette Colbert comedy, run backward.A young man (John) and a young woman (Mary) meet late on a Friday night at Friday's. They go to bed as strangers and then spend the next 24 hours rattling around John's apartment, alternately insulting each other and making up, trying to find out if they're fond of each other.Fred MacMurray and Claudette Colbert never went to bed together (Heaven and the late Eric Johnston know!) until they were properly married. But, as are John and Mary, they were symbols of an urban culture (made mythic by the stars' pretenses) who acted out the classic mating ritual of pursuit, rebuff, misunderstanding and reconciliation. There is nothing wrong with the idea of \"John and Mary,\" just with its execution.John Mortimer's screenplay is short-focused, its action confined mostly to John's apartment where John and Mary eat, talk and lie about with such dreary verisimilitude that you eventually find yourself less interested in John and Mary than in the settings, clothes and objects that surround them.I was struck (as I'm sure I was meant to be) by a pan shot across John's bedroom that revealed Norman Mailer's \"Miami and the Siege of Chicago\" standing next to Tom Wolfe's \"The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test.\" In another scene you see his linen closet stacked with bath-towels, which says more about the character of a well-organized, slightly prim bachelor than anything in the dialogue. He's obviously the sort of man who plans ahead, who gets to the laundry before it closes.Hoffman, who is so fine in \"Midnight Cowboy,\" is here upstaged by interior scenery. He gives a performance by combining his mannerisms, including the smile turned tentatively on and off like a light bulb and the stooped strut of an over-age Holden Caulfield. Miss Farrow is also meant to be appealing, but the role is so skimpily written that no amount of mumbling and pausing at odd points in the middle of a sentence can give it much life. What emerges is a character composed partly of the weird waif of \"Secret Ceremony,\" partly of the haunted mother of \"Rosemary's Baby,\" masquerading as an ordinary, almost slovenly girl whose brown jumper dress would probably be covered with cat hairs, if she had a cat.In the supporting cast are Sunny Griffin, as a shrill, high fashion model who was formerly John's mistress, and Michael Tolan, as a married member of Congress with whom Mary had an unhappy affair. They are characters who would be much more comfortable in the pseudo-sophisticated world of MacMurray and Colbert than in the neo-realistic one of Hoffman and Farrow.\"John and Mary\" is the work of Peter Yates (\"Robbery,\" Bullitt\"), who seems most at ease with firm of broadly choreographed movement and suspense. This one has little suspense and no movement, except for that of the camera in confined spaces.The film is not without relevance. People do flop into bed together these days without much preliminary investigation, often (like John and Mary) having exchanged vague opinions on Italian movies but not their own names. Social accuracy, however, can contribute to—but not substitute for—human comedy.\n\nJOHN AND MARY, screenplay by John Mortimer, based on the novel by Mervyn Jones; directed by Peter Yates; produced by Ben Kadish; released by 20th Century-Fox. At the Sutton Theater, 57th Street near Third Avenue. Running time: 92 minutes. (The Motion Picture Association of America's Production Code and Rating Administration classifies this film: \"R—restricted—persons under 16 not admitted, unless accompanied by parent or adult guardian.\")John . . . . .
