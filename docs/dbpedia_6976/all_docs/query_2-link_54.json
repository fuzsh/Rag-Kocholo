        "text": "In \"True Grit,\" the Coen brothers go mainstream - there's even a PG-13 rating - with hugely satisfying results.\n\nIt's the best Western in years and one of the best movies of the year, a rousing adventure that's also sneakily comic, with humor that rises from the sharply drawn characters and the dialogue they spout. And how wonderfully they spout!\n\nEthan and Joel must have relished the chance to have Jeff Bridges, the Dude in their \"Big Lebowski,\" give his ramshackle take on John Wayne's hard-drinking Rooster Cogburn. But you can also see what must have attracted them to the story at least as much: the words.\n\nMany of them are lifted just about verbatim from Charles Portis' novel, and they're magnificent- rococo, quasi-Biblical and deadpan funny. The Coens know how to use them and how to add to them.\n\nThey have a way with such dialogue, after all. Just think back on one of the best movie lines ever - Nicolas Cage in the Coens' \"Raising Arizona,\" lamenting this sad fact of his life with Holly Hunter: \"Her womb was a barren place in which my seed could find no purchase.\"\n\nSo here's this description of Cogburn, which the movie takes straight from the book: \"He is a pitiless man, double-tough, and fear don't enter into his thinking. He likes to pull a cork.\"\n\nThose words, of course, lead 14-year-old Mattie Ross to decide that Cogburn is a man with true grit, the right man to go after the coward Tom Chaney who killed her father.\n\nAnd watch young Mattie putting the preening LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) in his place after he brags of being a Texas Ranger: \"That may make you a big noise in that state. In Arkansas, you should mind that your Texas trappings and title do not make you an object of fun.\"\n\nNow this is girl who also has true grit, clearly.\n\nThe 1969 original was a fine movie that remains enjoyable today. But the remake is far better.\n\nFor one thing, this is not set in the sunny Western vistas of the original. The Coens place this story in winter, as in the novel, and it's spitting snow, which suits the darker tone of this story. The beards are better, and occur much more frequently. There's a crucial difference in the ending, too, one truer to Portis' novel, and much more satisfying.\n\nAnd there's no Glen Campbell around to stink up every scene.\n\nDamon, the dandyish Texas Ranger, is far, far better than the wooden Campbell of the original; Damon, as he showed in \"The Informant!,\" makes for a fine, likable buffoon.\n\nNewcomer Hailee Steinfeld should get an Oscar nomination for her take on Mattie (despite the Golden Globes' snubbing of her and the entire film). She spits out her dialogue with fire and humor and perfect timing. She's a joy to watch.\n\nAnd Bridges, wisely, doesn't try to outdo John Wayne. In a telling bit of demythologizing, Mattie first meets him when he's behind the door of an outhouse, taking his time about his business inside.\n\nHis Rooster, slurring his dialogue behind a gray beard and stained teeth, is more ruined than the Duke's. He does, however, get to grip his horse's reins between his teeth and charge at the bad guys.\n\nThe Coens, and their actors, are most careful when it comes to the film's main theme - the affection and respect that grows between grizzled lawman and determined girl. Wisely, it's revealed in a way that any good writing prof would demand: Show me, don't tell me. And they really show you.\n\nmatt.soergel@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4082"
