        "text": "New Zealand actor (born 1974)\n\nFor the Scottish soccer player, see Martin Henderson (footballer).\n\nMartin Henderson (born 8 October 1974) is a New Zealand actor. He is known for his roles on the American medical drama series Off the Map as Dr. Ben Keeton (2011), the medical drama series Grey's Anatomy as Dr. Nathan Riggs (2015–2017), the Netflix romantic drama Virgin River as Jack Sheridan (2019–present),[1] and for his performance as Noah Clay in the 2002 horror film The Ring, while remaining known in his home country for his teenage role as Stuart Neilson in the soap opera Shortland Street (1992–1995).[2]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHenderson was born in Auckland to Ian and Veronica Henderson. They divorced when he was five.[3] He began acting at the age of thirteen, appearing in Strangers, a local television production. He attended Birkenhead Primary Northcote Intermediate and Westlake Boys High schools.[4] He played rugby as a flanker and his team won the championship in 1990 and 1991.[5] He turned down going to study at university when he was 17, in favour of acting.[6] He initially considered studying science and business.[7]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly work\n\n[edit]\n\nAt age 17, in 1992, Henderson starred as Stuart Neilson in the New Zealand prime-time soap opera Shortland Street.[8] He played the role until 1995. Shortland Street became New Zealand's longest-running drama and soap opera.[9] He subsequently lived in Australia for three years[10] and appeared in a number of Australian films and television productions including Echo Point and Home and Away.\n\nMove to the United States\n\n[edit]\n\nHenderson moved to the United States in 1997 to pursue a career in Hollywood films and to train in a two-year program at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City with a student visa.[11] To pay the tuition, he took a job at night as a restaurant food runner.[12] While at school, he starred as Hamlet in the off-Broadway play Ophelia Thinks Harder. He left the school halfway through the two-year course and moved to Los Angeles.[12]\n\nHeath Ledger helped him financially during a period of numerous auditions without securing any role.[13] Henderson first landed a voice over part in a Fanta commercial, speaking with an Australian accent.[11] In 1999, he appeared in Kick, for which he was nominated for an AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 2000.[14] After more than a year unsuccessfully auditioning for film roles in Los Angeles, in 2001 he was cast in a supporting role in the John Woo-directed war film Windtalkers.[15] In 2002, Henderson starred opposite Naomi Watts in the horror film The Ring.[6] Following the box office success of the film, he was cast as Drew in Perfect Opposites,[16] and subsequently as the lead character in the biker film Torque, released in early 2004.[17] Later that year, he starred opposite Aishwarya Rai in the British romantic film Bride and Prejudice and appeared in Britney Spears' \"Toxic\" music video.[17] In 2005, he appeared in the award-winning Little Fish starring Cate Blanchett.[6] In 2006, Henderson received rave reviews in London's West End in a theatre production of Fool for Love with Juliette Lewis.[18][19]\n\nHe was set to star alongside Jordana Brewster in the television series adapted from the 2005 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith. However, the series was not picked up by any network. In 2006, he appeared in the movie Flyboys. He also appeared in a commercial for the 2008 Cadillac CTS, and the House episode \"Painless\". In 2010, Henderson was cast in Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes' short-lived television series Off the Map as a New Zealand doctor.[20] In 2014, he starred in the multi-platform Australian drama television series Secrets & Lies and in the SundanceTV drama series The Red Road.\n\nIn 2015, Henderson appeared in Everest,[21] with Jake Gyllenhaal. In June that year, he joined the cast of Grey's Anatomy, as a potential love interest for series lead Ellen Pompeo's Meredith Grey,[22] making his first appearance in November. The actor exited two years later, his final appearance in October 2017. Henderson told Deadline that his departure was a storytelling-based decision, adding, \"This [was] my final year so I was expecting Nathan’s storyline to be wrapped up.\"[23] In 2016, he starred in the film Miracles from Heaven opposite Jennifer Garner.[24]\n\nSince 2019, Henderson has co-starred on the Netflix series Virgin River alongside Alexandra Breckenridge, playing the role of Jack Sheridan, a former marine with PTSD.[25] The series was renewed by Netflix for a fourth and fifth season in 2021. He was cast in A24 horror film X (2022) as Wayne Gilroy.[26]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2017, he lives in Los Angeles with his dog.[27]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1999 Kick Tom Bradshaw Nominated—AFI Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role 2000 Luke Short film 2002 Windtalkers Private Thomas Nellie 2002 Noah Clay 2003 Skagerrak Ian/Ken 2004 Torque Cary Ford 2004 Perfect Opposites Drew Curtis 2004 Bride and Prejudice William Darcy 2005 Little Fish Ray Robert Heart Nominated—AFI Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role[28]\n\nNominated—FCCA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role 2006 Flyboys Reed Cassidy 2006 Smokin' Aces Hollis Elmore 2007 Battle in Seattle Jay 2009 Cedar Boys Mathew 2010 Home by Christmas Young Ed 2013 John/Peter 2013 Devil's Knot Brent Davis 2015 Everest Andy Harris 2016 Miracles from Heaven Kevin Beam 2018 The Strangers: Prey at Night Mike 2018 Juveniles Oliver 2018 Hellbent Jeb Dupre 2022 X Wayne Gilroy\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1989 Strangers Zane — 1990 Betty's Bunch — — 1990 Raider of the South Seas Jack Taylor Television film 1992–1995, 2017 Shortland Street Stuart Neilson Main (27 episodes, Seasons 1-4 & 26) 1995 Echo Point Zac Brennan — 1996 Sweat Tom Nash Main (26 episodes, Season 1) 1996 Home and Away Geoff Thomas Recurring (7 episodes) 1997–1999 Big Sky Scotty Gibbs Main (53 episodes, Seasons 1–2) 2009 House Jeff Episode: \"Painless\"\n\nNominated—AFI International Award for Best Actor 2011 Off the Map Dr. Benjamin \"Ben\" Keeton Main (13 episodes, Season 1) 2012 Rake Joshua Floyd Guest (2 episodes, Season 2) 2014–2015 Harold Jensen Main (12 episodes, Seasons 1–2) 2014 Secrets & Lies Ben Gundelach Main (6 episodes, Season 1) 2015–2017 Grey's Anatomy Dr. Nathan Riggs Main (45 episodes, Seasons 12–14) 2019–present[29] Virgin River Jack Sheridan Main role 2020 The Gloaming Gareth McAvaney Main Role (8 Episodes) 2021–Present My Life Is Murder Will Crowe Recurring (Seasons 2–4) 2024 Madam [30]\n\nWeb series\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2013–2014 Auckland Daze Martin Henderson 3 episodes\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Notes 2003 Toxic Britney Spears' boyfriend\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
