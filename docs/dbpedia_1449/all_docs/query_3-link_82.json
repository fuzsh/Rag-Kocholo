        "text": "American actor (born 1972)\n\nEric William Dane (born November 9, 1972)[1] is an American actor. After multiple television roles in the 1990s and 2000s, which included his recurring role as Jason Dean in Charmed, Dane was cast as Dr. Mark Sloan on the ABC medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy (2006–2012, 2021). Following this, he made appearances in films such as Marley & Me (2008), Valentine's Day (2010), and Burlesque (2010). Dane has since played Captain Tom Chandler in the post-apocalyptic drama The Last Ship and currently stars as Cal Jacobs in the HBO series Euphoria.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nDane was born in San Francisco, California,[1] to William Melvin.[2][3] When Dane was 7 years old, his father died of a gunshot wound.[4][5] Dane has a younger brother.[6] They were raised in their mother's Jewish faith, and Dane had a bar mitzvah ceremony.[7][8][9] He attended Sequoia High School in Redwood City, California, from 1987 to 1990, and San Mateo High School in San Mateo, California, from 1990 to 1991, where he graduated. Dane was an athlete in high school, playing on the boys' varsity water polo team,[10] but pursued a career in acting after appearing in a school production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons.[11][12]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1993, Dane moved to Los Angeles,[10] where he played small roles in the television series Saved by the Bell, The Wonder Years, Roseanne, and Married... with Children, among others. But in 2000, he was signed for a recurring role in Gideon's Crossing, and followed this with a two-season run as Jason Dean in Charmed. His made-for-television film credits included two biopics, Serving in Silence (about Margarethe Cammermeyer's experiences in the military), and Helter Skelter, in which he portrayed Charles \"Tex\" Watson, a member of the Manson family.\n\nDane's first major feature film appearance was in The Basket. He also appeared in Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane, Sol Goode, Feast, X-Men: The Last Stand, and starred in Open Water 2. In 2005, Dane guested as Dr. Mark Sloan in \"Yesterday\", the eighteenth episode of the second season of the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy. Positive audience reaction to the character led to Dane's becoming a regular in the show's third season. His first appearance in the season, in which he walked out of the bathroom soaking wet and wearing only a strategically placed towel, was labeled a \"watercooler moment\".[13] Dane resigned from the show after the end of season 8 but appeared in the first two episodes of season 9.[14] In 2021, Dane reappeared on the show for the first time in nine years since his character was killed off.[15]\n\nIn December 2006, he starred in the A&E television film Wedding Wars as the brother of a gay man (played by John Stamos) who goes on strike in support of same-sex marriage. Dane, alongside Patrick Dempsey, appeared in the same big-screen project, the 2010 romantic comedy Valentine's Day. The Garry Marshall-directed film followed five interconnecting stories about Los Angelenos anticipating (or in some cases dreading) the holiday.[16]\n\nIn October 2012, Dane joined the main cast of the Michael Bay-produced TNT drama series The Last Ship.[17] He is also credited as a producer on the show.\n\nIn 2023, he described his experience on being in a show like Euphoria where he had to regularly wear a prosthetic penis.[18] He stated, \"Those scenes are very difficult to shoot,\" and that the scenes were \"pretty intense.\"[18]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDane married actress Rebecca Gayheart on October 29, 2004. They have two daughters together.[19] In February 2018, Gayheart filed for divorce from Dane after 14 years of marriage, citing \"irreconcilable differences\".[20]\n\nIn 2009, Dane made headlines when he was in a video that featured Dane, his wife and Kari Ann Peniche, nude and using drugs.[21]\n\nIn June 2011, Dane entered a California treatment center to recover from a dependency on prescription drugs he had developed after suffering a sports injury.[22]\n\nIn April 2017, The Last Ship halted production through Memorial Day to allow Dane to deal with the depression he was battling.[23]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1999 The Basket Tom Emery 2003 Sol Goode Overly Dramatic Actor 2004 Helter Skelter Charles “Tex” Watson 2005 Feast Hero 2006 X-Men: The Last Stand Jamie Madrox / Multiple Man Open Water 2: Adrift Dan 2008 Marley & Me Sebastian Tunney 2010 Valentine's Day Sean Jackson Burlesque Marcus Gerber 2017 Grey Lady Detective James Doyle 2021 The Ravine Mitch Bianci 2022 Redeeming Love Duke American Carnage Eddie 2023 Little Dixie Governor Richard Jeffs Americana Dillon MacIntosh Dangerous Waters Derek Stipes [24] 2024 Bad Boys: Ride or Die James McGrath [25] One Fast Move Dean Miller TBA Into the Beautiful Tom TBA Borderline Bell TBA Countdown Nathan Blythe TBA Family Secrets TBA TBA Kabul TBA\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1991 Saved by the Bell Tad Pogue Episode: \"The Game\" 1992 Renegade Jimmy Episode: Mother Courage 1993 Brett Episode: \"Nose\" 1995 Married... with Children Oliver Cole Episode: \"Radio Free Trumaine\" Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story Matt Television film 1996 Seduced by Madness:The Diane Borchardt Story Nick Silk Stalkings Justin Whalen Episode: \"Private Dancer\" Roseanne Bellhop Episode: \"Disney World War II\" 2000 Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane Alec Episode: \"Kiss of Death\" 2001 Gideon's Crossing Dr. Wyatt Cooper 4 episodes Ball & Chain Jack Television film 2002 Rob Goodwin 3 episodes 2003–04 Charmed Jason Dean 9 episodes 2004 Las Vegas Leo Broder 2 episodes Helter Skelter Charles \"Tex\" Watson Television film 2005 Painkiller Jane Nick Pierce 2006 Wedding Wars Ben Grandy 2006–12, 2021 Grey's Anatomy Dr. Mark Sloan/McSteamy Main role (seasons 3–9); Special guest star (season 2); Guest star (season 17); 140 episodes.\n\nSatellite Award for Best Cast – Television Series\n\nScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series\n\nNominated—Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series 2009–10 Private Practice Special Guest Star; 2 episodes 2014–18 The Last Ship Capt.
