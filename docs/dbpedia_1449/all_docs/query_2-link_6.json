The name was also occasionally anglicised \"Proudman\". The Ó Diomasaigh originated in the territory of Clanmalier, on the borders of what are now counties Laois and Offaly, and remained powerful in the area until the seventeenth century. In the 12th century, Henry II set his court up in Dublin and summoned the Leinster Chiefs. The O’Dempsey, Chief of Offaly, refused to attend. Strongbow together with his son-in-law De Quincy marched into the O'Dempsey territory to take land by force. In a famous battle the O'Dempsey together with his followers routed the Normans with great slaughter, an action that kept the Normans out of the Dempsey territories for over 300 years. In later years, their allegiance was to the English and they were involved with the newcomers in the massacre of the O’Lalors in Laois in 1577, an action which local tradition says was responsible for their later losses. Sir Terence: son of Dermod Ruadh; was knighted in May 1599 for services to the Crown by Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, lord lieutenant of Ireland; Charles the first recognised the strength of the family by granting the English titles of Viscount Clanmaliera and Baron Philipstown in 1631 to Terence O'Dempsey. (PJ Goode – The O'Dempsey Chronicles) The loyalty of the family to the Crown was short-lived, however, and the Williamite wars later in the century destroyed their power and scattered them.\n\nAnother source states:[5]\n\nThe O'Dempsey family derive their name from Diummasach, an 11th-century Uí Failge prince of the Clann Máel Ugra, aka Cenél Maoilughra. The Clann Máel Úgra, in turn, took their name from Máelaugrai, an Uí Failge chieftain who flourished in the middle of the 9th century. The center of their territory, anglicized Clanmalier, was near Ballybrittas in northeast Co. Leix. Their power later extended into the barony of Upper Phillipstown. O'Donovan, in his Ordnance Survey letters, places Clann-Maoilughra in the present Barony of Upper Philipstown in the King's County and the Barony of Portnahinch in the Queen's County.\n\nAccording to historian C. Thomas Cairney, the O'Dempseys were one of the chiefly families of the Ui Failghe who in turn were a tribe from the Dumnonii or Laigin who were the third wave of Celts to settle in Ireland during the first century BC.[6]\n\nDescent\n\n[edit]\n\nAn Ó Diomasaigh genealogy records the following:[5]\n\nFlann m. Máel Ruanaid m. Cellaich m. Máel Augra m. Conchobuir m. Áeda m. Tomaltajich m. Flaind m. Díumasaich m. Congaile m. Forannáin m. Congaile m. Máel h-Umai m. Cathail m. Bruidge m. Nath Í m. Rosa Failgi.\n\nThe final person may be identical with Failge Berraide (fl. 507–514), a king of the Uí Failghe and of Laigin descent (see List of kings of Uí Failghe).\n\nA new bloodline has been recently traced to when the Dempseys came to America. When the family known as the Dempseys got off the boat, they were asked their legal names by American officials, who would put them in the American records, making them a citizen, it was misspelt Dimsey, therefore creating the Dimsey bloodline. Another group of the family came on the boat, and was correctly identified as Dempsey, leading to the American Dempsey bloodline. Similarly, Dempcy dating back to the Revolutionary War, was also a misspelling of Dempsey.[original research?]\n\nDempseys in the annals\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Irish annals list a number of members of the family:\n\n789: Áedh [grandfather of Máelaugrai] was slain by Óengus son of Mugrón, king of Uí Failghe, in the oratory of Kilclonfert.\n\n1141: Donnchadh, son of Goll Gaibhle, i.e. Ua Conchobhair Failghe, was killed by the Uí Failghe themselves, i.e. the Clann-Maelughra.\n\n1161: Domhnall, son of Conghalach, son of Cuaifne Ua Conchobhair Failghe, Tanist of Uí Failghe, was slain by the Clann-Maelughra.\n\n1164: Maelseachlainn Ua Conchobhair Failghe, was slain by the Clann-Maelughra.\n\n1193: Diarmait, son of Cubrogam Ua Diumasaigh, chief of Clann-Mailighra and king of Uí Failghe for a long time, died.\n\n1383: Dermot O'Dempsy, Lord of Kinel-Maoilughra, was slain by the English.\n\n1394: Thomas O'Dempsy, heir to the lordship of Clann-Maoilughra, was slain by the English.\n\nOther Dempsey families\n\n[edit]\n\nAn unrelated family, rendered in Irish as Mac Diomasaigh, are found in County Antrim and its neighbouring counties.[7]\n\nBearers of the name\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable people with the surname Dempsey include:\n\nAmy Dempsey (born 1963), American art historian\n\nBill Dempsey (born 1942), former Australian rules footballer\n\nBill Dempsey (footballer) (1896–1967), English footballer\n\nCandace Dempsey, American author, journalist and travel writer\n\nCedric Dempsey, former American sports executive\n\nChester Dempsey (1896–1969) American farmer and politician\n\nClint Dempsey (born 1983), American soccer player\n\nCourtenay Dempsey (born 1987), Australian rules footballer\n\nDamien Dempsey, Irish singer and songwriter\n\nDan Dempsey, Australian rugby league footballer\n\nDenis Dempsey (1826–1896), Irish soldier, recipient of the Victoria Cross\n\nDonald Dempsey (c. 1932 – 2005), American recording executive\n\nEd Dempsey, Canadian ice hockey coach\n\nFrank Dempsey (1925–2013), American football player\n\nGary Dempsey, multiple people\n\nGeorge Dempsey, multiple people\n\nGirvan Dempsey (born 1975), Irish rugby union footballer\n\nHenry Dempsey, pilot who survived being sucked out of an airborne Beechcraft 99 aircraft in 1987\n\nHolli Dempsey, British actor\n\nIan Dempsey (born 1961), Irish radio presenter\n\nJack Dempsey (1895–1983), American boxer\n\nJack Dempsey (disambiguation), other people with this name\n\nJames Dempsey (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nJillian Dempsey (born 1991), American ice hockey player\n\nJillian Lee Dempsey, American inorganic chemist\n\nJohn Dempsey, multiple people\n\nJudy Dempsey (born 1956), Irish journalist and researcher\n\nJulia Dempsey (known as Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey), American religious sister, nurse and hospital administrator\n\nKyle Dempsey (born 1995) English footballer\n\nLawrence Dempsey (died 1690), an Irish soldier\n\nLorcan Dempsey (born 1958), Irish library information expert\n\nLuke Dempsey (born 1979/1980), Irish Gaelic football manager\n\nMark Dempsey, multiple people\n\nMartin Dempsey (born 1952), American general, 18th chairman, US Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\nMichael Dempsey, multiple people\n\nMick Dempsey, Irish Gaelic footballer\n\nMiles Dempsey (1896–1969), British general of World War II\n\nNathan Dempsey (born 1974), Canadian ice hockey player\n\nNick Dempsey (born 1980), English windsurfer\n\nNicola Dempsey (fl. 2015–), one half of comedy duo Flo and Joan\n\nNoel Dempsey (born 1953), Irish politician\n\nNonpareil Dempsey (1862–1895), ring name of Irish-born American boxer John Kelly\n\nPatrick Dempsey (born 1966), American actor and race car driver\n\nPaul Dempsey (born 1976), Australian rock musician\n\nRay Dempsey, Irish Gaelic footballer\n\nRey Dempsey, retired American college football coach\n\nRichard Dempsey (born 1974), English actor\n\nRick Dempsey (born 1949), retired American baseball player\n\nRosemary Dempsey, American feminist activist\n\nRosie Dempsey (fl. 2015–), one half of comedy duo Flo and Joan\n\nSandra Dempsey, Canadian playwright\n\nSandy Dempsey (1949–1975), actress\n\nShawna Dempsey, Canadian performance artist\n\nS.
