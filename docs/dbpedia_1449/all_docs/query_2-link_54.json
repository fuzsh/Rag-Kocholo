        "text": "There are plenty of new and returning cast members too, with one character – played by The Crown star Victoria Hamilton – serving as a potential new love interest for Dodds.\n\nWatkins told RadioTimes.com: \"Dodds fancies her a bit. He actually has a sort of dalliance, or it looks like he's heading that way, which is very unusual because he's been shut down in that respect for such a long time. There’s potential with this character.\"\n\nElsewhere, guest stars in episode 1 include an actor from Gentleman Jack, a former James Bond baddie, and a coach from The Voice Kids.\n\nMore like this\n\nFor more information about the McDonald & Dodds cast and who they play, read on.\n\nMcDonald & Dodds season 4 cast\n\nBelow are the main stars of McDonald & Dodds season 4. Read on for more information on the actors and their characters, as well as guest stars for the new run.\n\nJason Watkins plays DS Dodds\n\nTala Gouveia plays DCI Lauren McDonald\n\nClaire Skinner plays Chief Supt Ormond\n\nCharlie Chambers plays DC Goldie\n\nBhavik C Pankhania plays DC Lee\n\nJason Watkins plays DS Dodds\n\nWho is DS Dodds? Described as \"shy\" and \"unassuming\", DS Dodds has \"happily languished on the shelf for most of his working life\".\n\nHe's been working quietly and diligently at his desk in Bath for years without anyone taking much notice, but now his boss is hoping to push him into early retirement – so he's been paired with DCI Lauren McDonald and forced out into frontline action, which is quite a shock to the system.\n\nHowever, instead of giving up and taking his pension, Dodds proves himself a talented detective with \"a hidden talent for deciphering puzzles\".\n\nWhat else has Jason Watkins been in? Jason Watkins has had a prolific acting career across screen and stage, winning a BAFTA and bagging an Olivier nomination. He starred alongside David Tennant in the ITV crime drama Des (as Brian Masters), while international viewers might recognise him as Prime Minister Harold Wilson in season 3 of The Crown.\n\nHe's also played Roger in Hold the Sunset, Gavin in Trollied, Tim Ifield in Line of Duty, and Emlyn Hooson in A Very English Scandal, as well as starring in Channel 5 dramas Coma and The Catch.\n\nOther major roles have included William Herrick in Being Human, Simon Harwood in W1A, and the lead role in The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies, while the actor has also been in Taboo, Our Zoo and Doctor Who.\n\nTala Gouveia plays DCI Lauren McDonald\n\nWho is DCI Lauren McDonald? A \"wildly ambitious\" detective chief inspector transferred from the \"mean streets of South London\" to the quiet streets of Bath. She is young, talented, often underestimated, and is described as \"a tough, driven battering ram of a cop who cracks cases through sheer force of will\".\n\nMcDonald isn't initially pleased to be paired with Dodds, but the two soon form an unlikely partnership.\n\nWhat else has Tala Gouveia been in? She's been in Tracey Ullman's Show, Cold Feet, Go Jetters, Arrivals, EastEnders, Plebs and Scream Street.\n\nClaire Skinner plays Chief Supt Ormond\n\nWho is Chief Supt Ormond? Ormond is the chief superintendent, described as \"contained\", \"private\" and \"tough\". She's still ruffling a few feathers among the squad following her arrival, but they've largely grown accustomed to her ways.\n\nWhat else has Claire Skinner been in? Skinner is best known for her role as Sue Brockman in Outnumbered, but has also appeared in Doctor Who, Ted Lasso, Midsomer Murders and Bridget Jones's Diary, among many other roles.\n\nCharlie Chambers plays DC Goldie\n\nWho is DC Goldie? He works alongside McDonald and Dodds.\n\nWhat else has Charlie Chambers been in? He's best known for EastEnders.\n\nBhavik C Pankhania plays DC Lee\n\nWho is DC Lee? The newest member of McDonald and Dodds' team.\n\nWhat is Bhavik C Pankhania been in?
