        "text": "Amazon's details for next week or so:\n\nSunday - Leicester V Brighton - Logan, Morrison and Townsend in studio - Drury and Shearer commentating\n\nTuesday:\n\nWolves V Chelsea - Thomas, Scholes and J Cole - Mowbray and Upson commentating\n\nMan City V West Brom - Logan, Hargreaves, McManaman and Shearer - Drury and Townsend commentating\n\nWednesday:\n\nLeicester V Everton - Currie, P Neville and Schmeichel - commentary from Wilson and Morrioson\n\nArsenal V Southampton - Angus Scott, Campbell and Holland - Tyldesley and Osman commentating\n\nLeeds V Newcastle - Whitaker, Hasselbaink and L Ferdinand - commentary from Proudfoot and Hoddle\n\nLiverpool V Tottenham - Logan, Shearer, Martinez and Crouch - commentary from Champion and McCoist\n\nWest Ham V Crystal Palace - Buckland, H Redknapp and J Cole - commentary from McNamara and Ward\n\nFulham V Brighton - Somers, Jenas and Aluko - commentary from Darke and Upson\n\nThursday:\n\nAston Villa V Burnley - Rosenthal, Carney and M Brown - commentary from Tyldesley and Beglin\n\nSheff Utd V Man Utd - Thomas, Martinez, Scholes and Owen - commentary from Champion and McCoist\n\nGreat to see Champion and McCoist used for Livverpool and Man Utd games - although perhaps a surprise Tyldesley isn't doing one of those. We'll have to wait for games 28-30 of course.\n\nCo-commentators look weaker than last year. No Burley or Kilbane, perhaps because of travel restrictions. Not sure about Upson, Osman and especially Clinton Morrison as co-commentators.\n\nProudfoot instead of Summerton is disappointing and a shame no Derek Rae, again perhaps because of travel complications. The likes of Thierry Henry, Lee Dixon and Gramee Le Saux are notable absentees from last year, with Beglin, Jenas and Hoddle perhaps a bit underused. No Sue Smith, Matt Smith or Pardew either.\n\nApparently Dempsey was born in London, but Iâ€™ve never been sure if his accent is Irish or not.\n\nFunnily enough when he's commentated before I've seen people on Twitter suggesting he had a broad Norfolk accent. As I always say, for someone who has been involved in football on TV for about thirty years, he does seem a bit of an unknown quantity."
