        "text": "American actor (born 1965)\n\nMark Ross Pellegrino (born April 9, 1965) is an American actor of film and television. He is best known for his work as Lucifer in Supernatural, Paul Bennett in Dexter, Jacob in Lost, James Bishop in Being Human, Clayton Haas in Quantico, Joe Messing in Mulholland Drive, and Deputy Bill Standall in 13 Reasons Why.\n\nEarly life, family and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMark Pellegrino was born in Pasadena, California and grew up in Van Nuys, California.[1] He attended Notre Dame High School.[2] When he was in high school, he co-founded and sang in a heavy metal band, XL. It disbanded after school was finished.[3][4][5]\n\nAlthough he enrolled in college and achieved straight As, he dropped out after a year. He saw an advertisement for a modeling agency at a place called John Roberts Powers, where he received some free training. During his training he was picked out for talent by commercial agent Bob Hoover. He was set up with an agent and acting coaches. From there he was sent out into the world of acting and discovered the Meisner acting method. He had no dream to become an actor at the time.[6]\n\nFor most of his life, Mark believed his stepfather Bill Pellegrino (whom his mother divorced when he was two years old) was his biological father. As an adult, Mark ran a search on ancestry.com to learn more about his heritage. He discovered his DNA did not indicate Italian ancestry. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, he asked fans of TV show Supernatural on Twitter (now named X)[7] if they would be interested in finding his real father. Within an hour of posting, his father was found along with the knowledge of having two sisters and three brothers.[8][9] His biological father, Gerry, is of German descent.[10][11]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nPellegrino's first appearance into television was on season 2, episode 2 of the series L.A. Law. His debut film role was that of a narcotics dealer in 1987's Fatal Beauty. Some of his earlier television appearances are also in Northern Exposure, Tales from the Crypt, ER, Without a Trace, NYPD Blue, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Hunter, and The Commish.\n\nIn 1989, he portrayed Hulk Hogan's younger brother in No Holds Barred.\n\nIn 1991, he co-starred in Prayer of the Rollerboys as Christopher Collet's aide-de-camp.\n\nIn 1998, he played the Blonde Treehorn Thug who stuffs The Dude's head down the toilet and drops his bowling ball, breaking the floor tile, in the cult film The Big Lebowski.\n\nIn 1999, he appeared in season 7, episode 3 of The X-Files as a disgruntled fast food joint employee. He was featured in National Treasure as the background FBI agent known as Agent Johnson.\n\nIn 2001, he played a hitman in David Lynch's critically acclaimed Mulholland Drive. He portrayed terrorist bomber Bobby James on The Beast.\n\nIn 2005, he appeared in the Academy Award winning film Capote, playing murderer Dick Hickock.\n\nIn 2006, he played Sadik Marku, an Albanian mob boss, in two episodes of Without a Trace. The first episode was in season 4, episode 22 where he guest starred alongside Mark Sheppard who played Crowley in Supernatural. The second episode was in season 5, episode 5 where he guest starred alongside Rachel Miner who played Meg Masters also which is a role in Supernatural.\n\nIn March 2009, he was cast on the ABC series Lost for an appearance in the final 2 episodes of Season 5, to play the role of the mysterious Jacob. Although the press release for the episode refers to his character simply as man No. 1, the episode revealed that he portrayed Jacob, a mysterious character pivotal to the show's plot.\n\nOn June 26, 2009, it was also announced that he was cast in a recurring role as Lucifer in season 5 of the CW series Supernatural. He played a recurring role as Lucifer in season 7, and a main role as his character in seasons 12 and 13. He played a main role in season 14 as Nick, Lucifer's vessel, and was a special guest in season 15.\n\nIn 2011 he portrayed James Bishop, the leader of a vampire clan based in Boston, in the SyFy horror series Being Human in the first season, and reprised his role in seasons 2-4 as a recurring guest.[12]\n\nIn 2011, he and Curtis Armstrong, who played Metatron on Supernatural, guest starred alongside each other as well as their characters being enemy lawyers in season 7 of The Closer.\n\nIn 2012, he played a man that took a hit out on his wife, who also took one out on him, Daniel Drake in season 2, episode 8 of Person of Interest.\n\nIn 2015, he joined the ABC thriller series Quantico playing the recurring role of Clayton Haas.[13]\n\nIn 2018, he voiced and motion captured his first video game role as antagonist Jacob Seed in one Ubisoft's Far Cry 5.\n\nIn 2021 and 2024, he played Virgil Poe in the American Rust TV series, a show based on the novel of the same name written by Philipp Meyer.\n\nIn July 2024, he appeared in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F as one of Captain Cade Grant's, played by Kevin Bacon, main man antagonist named Beck.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe is married to Tracy Pellegrino.[14] He sometimes teaches at Playhouse Paris, which is a Meisner training school his wife owns and runs in Paris, France.[15]\n\nHis favorite thing to do in the world is to teach[16] and if he was not an actor his alternate career would be to teach history.[17]\n\nHe is an atheist.[18]\n\nHe is a follower of Objectivism, a philosophy created by Russian-American writer Ayn Rand.[19] Before that he used to be an environmentalist and a registered Democrat.[20] Two of the ways he spreads Rand's views are through two YouTube platforms. The first one is through an affiliation with the Ayn Rand Centre UK,[21] and the second is to his own account with a series he has created called: Reality Checks, which are videos of ideas based on philosophical topics of everyday life.[22]\n\nHe has described his political views as classical liberalism.[23]\n\nHe is a co-founder of The American Capitalist Party.[24][25] The party stands for individual rights, limited constitutional government, and laissez-faire capitalism.[26]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes works that have not yet been released\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1987 Fatal Beauty Frankenstein Death Wish 4: The Crackdown Punk 1989 No Holds Barred Randy Thomas Night Life Allen Patumbo 1990 Prayer of the Rollerboys Bango 1991 Blood and Concrete / Blood & Concrete: A Love Story Bartholomew “Bart” Daniels Inside Out Jack Segment \"Doubletalk\" - misspelled name as \"Mark Pelligrino\" 1992 Lethal Weapon 3 Billy Phelps Mission of Justice The Gauntlet Fighter 1993 Trouble Bound Deputy Roy Midnight Witness Robert \"Robbie/Rob\" Patterson Bank Robber Motorcycle Cop Ted 1994 F.T.W Deputy Jimmy Sommers 1996 For Life or Death / Soul of the Avenger Earl Stockman Misspelled name as \"Mark Pelligrino\" 1997 The Lost World: Jurassic Park Tourist #6 Deleted scene Movies Kill The Temple of Phenomenal Things Dodd Macon County Jail Dan Oldum 1998 The Big Lebowski Blonde Treehorn Thug #2 A Murder of Crows Professor Arthur Corvus 1999 Clubland Lipton T Misspelled name as \"Matt Pellegrino\" Certain Guys Cal Word of Mouth Darrow Credited as \"Robert Rand\" Honest Injun 2000 House of Love Neil Credited as \"Henry Taggert\"[27] Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel Tripper Drowning Mona Murphy \"Murph\" Calzone 2001 Say It Isn't So Jimmy Mitchelson Mulholland Drive Joe Messing Fault Lines Monsters Sally Spinelli 2002 The Killer Next Door / Ronnie Keith Schwann Mother Ghost The Waiter Misspelled name as \"Mark Pellagrino\" Treading Water The Actor 2003 Moving Alan Alan Kennard The Hunted Dale Hewitt 2004 Spartan Convict Twisted Jimmy Schmidt National Treasure FBI Agent Johnson 2005 Ellie Parker Justin Capote Richard Eugene \"Dick\" Hickock 2006 Caffeine Tom 2007 The Number 23 Kyle Flinch 2008 The Coverup / The Thacker Case Ron Pebble 2009 An American Affair Graham Caswell Two:Thirteen John Tyler Disappearing In America The Bodyguard Misspelled name as \"Mark Pellligrino\" only in the opening credits 2011 Joint Body / The Bandit Nick Burke Bad Meat Doug Kendrew Post Mark 2013 Bad Turn Worse / We Gotta Get Out Of This Place Giff The Trials of Cate McCall Detective Robert Welch 2018 Beirut Cal Riley 2024 Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F Beck TBA Strangers in a Strange Land † Grungy Man Post-production\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1987 L.A.
