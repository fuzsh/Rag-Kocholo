        "text": "American film actor and producer (1933–2024)\n\nNot to be confused with Mark Harmon.\n\nMark Damon (born Alan Harris; April 22, 1933 – May 12, 2024) was an American film producer and actor. He won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor for his performance in Roger Corman's House of Usher, before moving to Italy and becoming a notable Spaghetti Western star and member of the 1960s 'Dolce Vita' set of actors and actresses in Rome.[1]\n\nDuring the early 1970s, he became a film producer, and would become one of Hollywood's most prolific producers. He founded the production companies Producers Sales Organization, Vision International, MDP Worldwide and Foresight Unlimited.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMark Damon was born Alan Harris in Chicago, the son of a grocer. His family was Jewish, and their surname had originally been \"Herscovitz.\"[3] Damon moved to Los Angeles at a young age where he attended Fairfax High School.[4]\n\nAs a senior in high school, he was scouted as an actor by Groucho Marx, but chose to attend dental school at UCLA. He soon switched to the Anderson School of Management, eventually graduating with an MBA and a BA in English. Damon also began taking theater classes, and decided that he wanted a career as an actor.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nActor\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1956, Damon started his career in Hollywood, signing a contract with 20th Century Fox.[6] In 1960, Damon won a Golden Globe Award as a \"Star of Tomorrow\" for his performance in the film House of Usher.[7] He would relocate to Rome, Italy afterwards, to star in spaghetti westerns.\n\nProducer\n\n[edit]\n\nDamon eventually gave up acting in the mid-1970s to become a film producer. He first entered the world of independent sales and production in the 1970s while living and working in Italy where he saw a huge market of independent international distributors eager for top American movies.[8]\n\nWhen he returned to the U.S. in 1977, he founded Producers Sales Organization (PSO). His goal was to sell important American pictures to international distributors, the first such company to compete with the major studios.[9] Damon's subsequent success with PSO led to his reputation as the inventor of the foreign sales business and the brains behind independent film production.[10]\n\nHis early visionary contributions to the international distribution of independently produced films are widely recognized and he has developed a reputation in the entertainment industry as not only one of the leading producers and distributors of independent films,[11] but as the \"legendary Mark Damon\"[12] for his contribution to independent film finance structures by developing the industry-standard practice of pre-selling foreign rights and banking the distribution contracts.[8] After PSO shut down, he was proposed to eye international productions,[13] then he started Vision p.d.g. International, or Vision Productions (formerly Vision Producers and Distribution Group), with Peter Guber and Jon Peters, founders of The Guber-Peters Company, and it would arrange financing and worldwide distribution for some 6-8 films that were internationally, as well as some product for TV.[14][15]\n\nLater that year, in 1987, Vision International decided to grow into Vision p.d.g. and its foreign sales arm Vision International budgeted in the $5 million range to have nine films for a total of $71 million.[16] Vision International then formed a pact with Epic Productions, where they assumed international responsibilities for the studio.[17]\n\nIn 1993 (after a period of legal battling with Credit Lyonnais over the company's control of Epic),[18][19] he started MDP Worldwide (aka Mark Damon Productions), for short, which in 1998, was sold to Behaviour Communications, a Canadian company, which renamed to Behaviour Worldwide, before selling it back in 2000, reverting to MDP Worldwide.[20] On June 23, 1999, Behaviour announced that its Worldwide division would cut more than 10 jobs.[21] In 2003, MDP Worldwide was then renamed to Media 8 Entertainment, in order to expand their own theatrical activity and their products, to change focus.[22] He then subsequently resigned on October 14, 2004.[23]\n\nDamon's productions have grossed over $2 billion in theatrical box office worldwide.[24] Damon has been directly involved in the international licensing of over 300 feature length pictures, including such noteworthy box-office titles as the James Bond film Never Say Never Again, directed by Irvin Kershner and starring Sean Connery, Prizzi's Honor, directed by John Huston and featuring Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston, Once Upon A Time In America, directed by Sergio Leone and featuring Robert De Niro and James Woods, The Cotton Club, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and featuring Richard Gere and The Final Countdown, starring Kirk Douglas.[7]\n\nDamon produced or executive produced over 70 films and played a role in 50 films, and his films received 10 Oscar nominations including: the 2005 Academy Award winner Monster, starring Charlize Theron; the critically acclaimed, multi-Oscar nominated World War II drama Das Boot, directed by Wolfgang Petersen; and The NeverEnding Story, also directed by Wolfgang Petersen. Other acclaimed films include The Upside of Anger, starring Oscar nominee Joan Allen and Kevin Costner; 9½ Weeks, directed by Adrian Lyne; 8 Million Ways to Die, directed by Hal Ashby; Short Circuit, directed by John Badham; High Spirits directed by Neil Jordan; The Choirboys directed by Robert Aldrich; The Lost Boys, directed by Joel Schumacher; The Jungle Book, directed by Stephen Sommers; The Musketeer directed by Peter Hyams and Beyond A Reasonable Doubt, also directed by Peter Hyams, and starring Michael Douglas. Damon was a founding member of the American Film Marketing Association (now IFTA) and is a recurring board member of the IFTA.[24][25]\n\nIn 2005, Damon founded film production, financing, and sales company Foresight Unlimited. Foresight handled international sales for, co-financed, and produced the Rob Reiner comedy And So It Goes, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton. The company served as executive producer on Universal Studios' 2 Guns, starring Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington, and Universal's Lone Survivor, directed by Peter Berg and starring Mark Wahlberg.[24] It was sold to Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment in 2019.[26] On April 30, 2019, his company DCR Finance Group launched a $100 million film fund in order to invest money for their own film organization and served as managing partner for the company.[27]\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nDamon lived with his wife, actress Margaret Markov (née Margaret Mary Markov) in Beverly Hills, California. They had two children. He died in Los Angeles on May 12, 2024, at the age of 91.[28][29]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2019 The Last Full Measure Producer 2018 The Hurricane Heist Producer 2017 Blind Executive Producer Starring Alec Baldwin 2014 And So It Goes Producer Starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton 2013 Lone Survivor Executive Producer Starring Mark Wahlberg 2013 2 Guns Executive Producer Starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg 2012 Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning Executive Producer Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren 2011 Flypaper Producer Starring Patrick Dempsey and Ashley Judd 2011 The Ledge Producer Starring Charlie Hunnam, Liv Tyler, and Terrence Howard 2009 Universal Soldier: Regeneration Executive Producer Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren 2009 It's Alive Executive Producer 2009 Beyond a Reasonable Doubt Producer Starring Michael Douglas 2007 Captivity Producer 2006 O Jerusalem Producer 2005 The Upside of Anger Executive Producer Starring Kevin Costner and Joan Allen 2004 Beyond The Sea Executive Producer Starring Kevin Spacey 2004 The I Inside Producer 2003 Monster Producer Starring Charlize Theron\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\nIndependent Spirit Award for Best First Feature 2003 11:14 Executive Producer 2003 The United States of Leland Executive Producer Starring Don Cheadle 2002 Extreme Ops Executive Producer 2002 FeardotCom Executive Producer 2001 The Musketeer Executive Producer 2001 The Body Executive Producer 2000 Love & Sex Executive Producer 1999 Eye of the Beholder Executive Producer Starring Ewan McGregor 1999 A Dog of Flanders Executive Producer 1997 Deceiver Wayland's Father\n\nExecutive Producer 1997 The Blackout Executive Producer 1996 The Winner Executive Producer 1994 The Jungle Book Executive Producer 1993 Stalingrad Executive Producer 1991 Diary of a Hitman Executive Producer 1990 Vietnam, Texas Executive Producer 1989 Wild Orchid Producer Starring Mickey Rourke 1988 High Spirits Executive Producer 1988 Bat*21 Co-Producer 1988 Mac and Me Executive Producer 1987 The Lost Boys Executive Producer 1986 Flight of the Navigator Executive Producer 1986 Short Circuit Executive Producer 1986 8 Million Ways to Die Executive Producer Starring Jeff Bridges 1986 9½ Weeks Producer Starring Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger\n\nDirected by Adrian Lyne 1986 The Clan of the Cave Bear Executive Producer 1984 Metropolis Sales Agent 1984 The NeverEnding Story Executive Producer Directed by Wolfgang Petersen 1981 Das Boot Executive Producer Directed by Wolfgang Petersen\n\nNominated for Six Academy Awards 1977 The Choirboys Executive Producer 1974 There Is No 13 George Thomas 1974 The Arena Producer Starred Damon's future wife Margaret Markov 1973 Crypt of the Living Dead Peter 1973 The Devil's Wedding Night Karl Schiller 1973 Little Mother Riano 1972 Byleth: The Demon of Incest Duke Lionello Shandwell [30] 1972 Great Treasure Hunt Kansas Lee 1972 I leoni di Pietroburgo Eldar 1972 Confessioni segrete di un convento di clausura Domenico 1972 They Call Him Veritas Veritas 1971 Long Live Robin Hood Allen 1971 Ivanhoe, the Norman Swordsman Ivanhoe 1971 Pistol Packin' Preacher Slim 1968 Dead Men Don't Count Johnny Dalton 1968 Anzio Wally Richardson Directed by Edward Dmytryk 1968 All Out Johnny 1968 The Young, the Evil and the Savage Richard Barrett 1968 Train for Durango Brown 1967 Golden Chameleon Vittorio 1967 No Killing Without Dollars Laurence 1967 Requiescant George Ferguson Also starring Pier Paolo Pasolini 1966 Johnny Yuma Johnny Yuma 1966 Ringo and His Golden Pistol Johnny Oro/Ringo aka Johnny Oro, directed by Sergio Corbucci 1966 Dio, Come Ti Amo!
