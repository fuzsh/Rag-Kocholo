        "text": "American professional wrestler\n\nBailey Matthews (born 30 December 1996) is an English-American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE where he performs on their NXT brand under the ring name Charlie Dempsey. He is the leader of the No Quarter Catch Crew stable and is the current NXT Heritage Cup Champion in his second reign.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\n[edit]\n\nTraining and independent circuit (2018–2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 9 February, 2018, Matthews made his wrestling debut for All Star Wrestling as Joe Bailey, where he was defeated by Tony Spitfire. Throughout 2019 and 2020, Bailey made appearances in Progress Wrestling, Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), and Evolve.[2]\n\nIn 2020, Matthews joined New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as a Young Lion. Although he would never end up appearing for the company, as he later left for WWE.[3]\n\nIn 2022, Matthews returned to Progress Wrestling, under his Charlie Dempsey ring name. He competed in the Super Strong Style 16 Tournament, where he defeated Charles Crowley in the first round and was defeated by Chris Ridgeway in the quarterfinal.[2]\n\nWWE\n\n[edit]\n\nNXT UK (2021–2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2021, Matthews signed with WWE, where he was assigned to the NXT UK brand. Matthews later reverted to the ring name Charlie Dempsey. Dempsey made his debut on 25 February edition of NXT UK, where he was defeated by Tyler Bate.[citation needed] Dempsey later joined Teoman and Rohan Raja to form Die Familie[4] and began a feud with Gallus, establishing himself as a heel in the process. On the 18 November edition of NXT UK, Die Familie defeated Gallus in their first ever match as a team.[5] Die Familie also started a feud with A-Kid. On the 10 March 2022 edition of NXT UK, Dempsey defeated A-Kid. Dempsey was later challenged by A-Kid to a British Rounds Rules match. This took place on the 21 April edition of NXT UK, where Dempsey won 2–1 in the sixth round. Dempsey competed in a tournament for the NXT United Kingdom Championship, where he lost to Oliver Carter in his final match for NXT UK.[citation needed]\n\nNXT (2022–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: No Quarter Catch Crew\n\nIn August 2022, Dempsey moved to the NXT brand. On the 14 February, 2023 edition of NXT, Dempsey started associating with Drew Gulak, where Gulak served as a teacher for Dempsey. On the 18 April 2023 edition of NXT, Dempsey challenged Wes Lee for the NXT North American Championship, which he lost. In the following months, Dempsey and Gulak formed No Quarter Catch Crew (NQCC), where they would later be joined by Myles Borne and Damon Kemp.[citation needed] Throughout August and September, Dempsey competed in the NXT Global Heritage Invitational to crown a #1 Contender for the NXT Heritage Cup. Dempsey came up empty-handed as he lost to the likes of Axiom (formerly A-Kid), Tyler Bate, and Butch. On the 13 December 2023 edition of NXT, Dempsey was involved in a triple threat match for the NXT North American Championship with Joe Coffey and the NXT North American Champion Dragon Lee, who retained his title.[citation needed]\n\nOn the 27 February 2024 edition of NXT, Dempsey defeated The Meta-Four's Noam Dar 2–1 in a British Rounds Rules match to become the new NXT Heritage Cup Champion.[6] At NXT: Roadblock, NQCC announced that the NXT Heritage Cup will be defended by the whole stable under the \"Catch Clause\".[7][8] Under the Catch Clause, NQCC as a whole referred to themselves as the NXT Heritage Cup Champions but WWE only recognize Dempsey as the official champion. The Catch Clause was invoked on the 19 March episode of NXT, with Gulak defeating Chase University's Riley Osborne 2–1 to successfully defend the Cup.[9] On the 16 April episode of NXT, The D'Angelo Family leader Tony D'Angelo revealed that his Family were hired by NQCC to (kayfabe) eliminate Gulak. In reality, Gulak was written off following allegations from Ronda Rousey that Gulak grabbed her pants' drawstrings backstage in 2022. Gulak subsequently left WWE on 3 May.[10][11] D'Angelo demanded payment for the job but NQCC refused, causing a brawl between the two factions[12] and resulting in a six-man tag team match between the two factions at Week 1 of Spring Breakin', which was won by The D'Angelo Family (D'Angelo, Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo and Luca Crusifino).[13] On the 7 May episode of NXT, Dempsey and Borne faced Tyson DuPont and Tyrek Igwe in a tag team match. Before the match started, the match referee was declared \"unavailable\" and Stacks was announced as the special guest referee, costing Dempsey and Borne the match through a fast count. After the match, an irate Dempsey gave D'Angelo a title shot at the NXT Heritage Cup as payment due to the D'Angelo Family and invoked the Catch Clause, which was nullified when D'Angelo and his Family kidnapped Kemp and Borne later that night.[14] One week later, D'Angelo defeated Dempsey 2–1 to win the Cup, ending Dempsey's reign at 76 days.[15] After the loss of the Cup, Dempsey declared that the stable needs structure and a chain of command and assumed a leadership role. He then ordered Kemp to face D'Angelo in a rematch for the Cup but Kemp lost the match 0–2 on the June 4 episode of NXT.[16][17] On the August 13 episode of NXT, Dempsey defeated Tony D’Angelo 2-1 to win the NXT Heritage Cup for the second time after some outside interference from new stablemate Wren Sinclair.[18]\n\nAll Japan Pro Wrestling (2023–2024)\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey made his return to Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) on 31 December, 2023, where he teamed up with Yuma Anzai to face LEONA and Tatsumi Fujinami in a victorious effort. At AJPW’s New Year Giant Series, Dempsey challenged Katsuhiko Nakajima for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, which Nakajima won.[19][20]\n\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling (2024–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey made his Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) debut on the 4 July 2024 episode of TNA Impact! where he attacked Leon Slater and Trey Miguel during their match. After the attack, Miguel's tag team partner Zachary Wentz (who formerly wrestled in NXT as Nash Carter), challenged Dempsey to a match.[21] On the following week, Dempsey defeated Wentz in his TNA in-ring debut after interference from Myles Borne.[22]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMatthews is the son of English retired professional wrestler Darren Matthews, who is best known as William Regal.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\n[edit]\n\nUltimate British Wrestling\n\nUBW Infinity Championship (2 times)\n\nWWE\n\nNXT Heritage Cup (2 times, current)[23]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
