Previously, it was most notably fronted by Jeff Stelling from 1994 until 2023. The programme is sponsored by Gillette Labs.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSoccer Saturday grew out of Sports Saturday, which started in August 1992 and was hosted by Paul Dempsey and Sue Barker.[1] Sports Saturday was similar in format to the BBC's Grandstand programme featuring a variety of sports and as with Grandstand, the programme finished with news of the day's football in a segment called Scorelines.[2] Jeff Stelling joined the programme in 1994 and became its sole presenter a year later.\n\nFrom the start of the 1998/99 season, it became a football-only programme and accordingly the name of the programme changed to Soccer Saturday.\n\nPrior to May 2010, portions of the programme were simulcast on Sky Sports 1 as well as Sky Sports News. The portions simulcast were between 12:00 and 12:30, and 15:00 and 17:15, although this differed depending on the matches being covered on Sky Sports 1. From the start of the 2010–11 season these simulcasts were dropped and for the next three seasons the programme was exclusive to Sky Sports News. The Sky Sports 1 simulcast returned for the 2013–14 season as part of Sky Sports 1's new all-day Saturday football service.[3] For the 2014–15 season the programme moved from Sky Sports 1 to Sky Sports 5 but reverted to Sky Sports 1 for the 2016–17 season.\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nSoccer Saturday is broadcast from 12:00 on Sky Sports News and usually airs for six hours. The programme begins with the host and six regular in-studio pundits previewing the weekend's matches, reviewing recent results and debating current issues in football. During Jeff Stelling's tenure as presenter the show was also famous for the rapport between himself and the pundits. There was much banter between the pundits and Stelling, who, in a good humoured manner, often pointed out the other's mistakes and incorrect predictions. Stelling exuberantly celebrated goals scored by his favourite team (Hartlepool United). Viewers are kept updated on the progress of early kick-offs by reporters at the games and by graphics below and to the right of the director's cut. These graphics also includes latest team news and league standings.\n\nFrom 15:00 to 17:15, Soccer Saturday provides running coverage of the 3 pm league matches, of which none is televised in the UK and one is televised in Ireland. The graphics display a vidiprinter and cycle through current scores in the English and Scottish leagues, with Simon Thomas providing commentary on the events as they unfold. Significant events at the most high-profile games – almost always in the Premier League – are described by the studio panel who each watch a game on a monitor. Other games deemed important are reported on by correspondents at the grounds connected to the studio by a video link, ISDN or telephone. Where a video link is used, it shows the reporter facing the pitch so that the stand is in the background, in line with the FA blackout which prohibits broadcasting live football during those hours. This portion of the show is also aired on Sky Showcase.\n\nAfter the 3 pm games finish, the classified football results are read by Alan Lambourn and this is followed by a run-through of the updated league tables. A commercial break then follows and this is when the vidiprinter is removed from the screen. For the final 45 minutes of the programme the studio pundits discuss the games they have been watching, and post-match interviews with players and managers are shown.\n\nThe regular format occasionally changes, for example during international windows when no Premier League or Championship matches are played, the show is shortened to 14:00 and 17:30, and League 1 and 2 fixtures are then covered by the studio pundits as opposed to the usual Premier League ones. Julian Warren presents Soccer Saturday during the international break.\n\nSoccer Special\n\n[edit]\n\nA programme with the same format is also broadcast when there are a number of midweek games, such as on UEFA Champions League nights, in which case it is known as Soccer Special. Since 2011, Soccer Special has been hosted by Julian Warren. Between 2008 and 2011, Ed Chamberlin presented the programme. He had previously shared presenting the programme with Ian Payne during the previous season. Soccer Special was hosted by Stelling until he began presenting Monday Night Football at the start of the 2005–06 season. The midweek Soccer Specials are often simulcast on Sky Sports 1. From the 2015–2016 season, Stelling started presenting Soccer Special again as Sky lost the rights to Champions League coverage to BT Sport.\n\nThe Soccer Special name is also used when a full afternoon programme of football is played on a day other than Saturday, which usually only occurs on Boxing Day, New Year's Day (unless that falls on either Friday or Sunday) and Easter Monday as well as the last day of the Championship and the last day of the Premier League season as both are normally played on a Sunday. On these occasions the programme was usually presented by Stelling and followed the normal Soccer Saturday format. One notable difference is that unlike the normal Soccer Saturday broadcasts, the goals that are being scored can be shown live on television as there is no blackout on those days.\n\nSports Saturday/Sunday\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a few years during the summer, the show was replaced with Sports Saturday, which is more akin to the show's original format, concentrating on sports other than football due to the absence of competitive football during the summer. This again was presented by Ed Chamberlin. The programme did not return in 2009 or 2010, but was revived in July 2011, although it was presented by regular Sky Sports News presenters.\n\nHowever, in August 2010, Sky announced the launch of Sports Sunday. This programme, which aired Sundays from 13:00–18:00, was similar to the old Sports Saturday format, was initially presented by Ed Chamberlain but after his promotion in early 2011 to additional football presenting duties on Sky Sports, the programme started to be presented by other presenters from the Sky Sports News roster.\n\nFrom 2021, Sports Sunday began to show the vidiprinter on screen throughout the programme, which by now was on air from 12:00–18:00, on which the latest British and European scores are displayed. The scores shown also include the Women's Super League and the Women's Championship.\n\nPresenters and reporters\n\n[edit]\n\nPresenter: Simon Thomas\n\nRelief/Soccer Special Presenter: Julian Warren and Nick Powell\n\nLead Studio Pundit: Paul Merson\n\nAdditional Studio Pundits: Alan McInally, Michael Dawson, Matt Murray, Jamie Mackie, Lee Hendrie, Clinton Morrison, Kris Boyd, Sue Smith and Mike Dean\n\nReporters: Bianca Westwood, David Craig, Guy Havord, Dickie Davis, Rob Palmer, Johnny Phillips, Neil Mellor, Peter Smith, Peter Stevenson, Stuart Jarrold, Simon Watts, Tony Colliver, Jonathan Beales, Rob McCaffrey, Steve Jackson, Mike Jones, Russ Taylor, Mark Benstead, Mark McAdam, Frank Gilfeather, Andy Walker, Stuart Lovell, Davie Donaldson, Dave Bracegirdle, John Temple, Jaydee Dyer, Courtney Sweetman-Kirk, Abigail Davies, Des Hinks, Katie Shanahan, Lynsey Hooper and Jessica Creighton\n\nFormer Reporters: John Gwynne, Bob Hall, Chris Kamara\n\nFormer Presenters: Paul Dempsey, Jeff Stelling\n\nRodney Marsh was a regular pundit, known for his outspoken views, until being sacked by Sky Sports in early 2005 after a joke referencing the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.[4] George Best was also a regular until leaving in 2004 to fight alcohol problems. In August 2020, regular studio pundits Matt Le Tissier, Phil Thompson and Charlie Nicholas were controversially sacked from the programme.[5][6] Other former studio analysts include Frank McLintock, Alan Brazil, Alan Mullery, Clive Allen, and Gordon McQueen.\n\nOn 30 October 2021, Stelling announced his intention to leave Soccer Saturday at the end of the 2021–22 season.[7] However, on 28 March 2022, Sky Sports announced that Stelling would be staying until at least the end of the 2022–23 season. He then confirmed on 29 April 2023 that he would be leaving the show and the organisation.[8] Stelling was succeeded by Simon Thomas.\n\nIn April 2022, it was announced that Chris Kamara would leave Soccer Saturday at the end of the 2021–22 season after working on the programme for 24 years.[9]\n\nCurrent presenters\n\n[edit]\n\n* Denotes relief presenter\n\nPresenter Duration Simon Thomas 2022, 2023– *Julian Warren 2011–\n\nPrevious presenters\n\n[edit]\n\n* Denotes relief presenter\n\nPresenter Duration *Ed Chamberlin 2008–2011 Paul Dempsey 1992–1994 Sue Barker 1992–1994 Jeff Stelling 1994–2023\n\nCurrent analysts\n\n[edit]\n\n* Denotes relief presenter\n\nAnalyst Duration Paul Merson 2006– Alan McInally 1998– Michael Dawson 2017– Clinton Morrison 2018– Tim Sherwood 2020– Lee Hendrie 2020– Kris Boyd 2020– Jamie Mackie 2020– Matt Murray 2012– Sue Smith 2018– Jobi McAnuff 2021– Mike Dean 2023–\n\nPrevious analysts\n\n[edit]\n\nList includes both full time regular analysts, guests and reliefs.\n\nAnalyst Duration Glenn Murray 2023 Robert Earnshaw 2023 Karen Carney 2022 Danny Mills 2021, 2023 Neil Lennon 2021 Gerry Taggart 2021 Gary Caldwell 2021 Ryan Lowe 2021 Jermaine Beckford 2021 Charlie Austin 2021 Sean St Ledger 2021 Mark Wright 2021 Kenny Miller 2021, 2022 Ally McCoist 2020–2021 Daniel Gabbidon 2020 Shaun Goater 2020 Paul Cook 2020 Gareth Ainsworth 2020, 2021, 2022 Gary Rowett 2019, 2020, 2021 Francis Benali 2019, 2021 Gary O'Neil 2019, 2020 Emile Heskey 2019 Troy Deeney 2019 Andy Hinchcliffe 2019 Danny Cowley 2019 Lee Bowyer 2018, 2020 Kelly Smith 2011, 2022 Shola Ameobi 2018, 2019 Steve Cotterill 2017, 2018 Paul Heckingbottom 2017 Paul Robinson 2017 Joleon Lescott 2015–2021 Niall Quinn 2015–2016 David Prutton 2015, 2017 Ryan Mason 2015, 2018 Peter Schmeichel 2015 Dwight Yorke 2015 Mark Schwarzer 2015 Glen Johnson 2014–2021 Neil Mellor 2014–2021 Karl Robinson 2014 Shaun Derry 2014 Dietmar Hamann 2013 Jimmy Bullard 2013 Robbie Fowler 2012 Sean Dyche 2012 Tony Pulis 2012, 2013, 2014, 2020 Phil Babb 2011, 2022 Jamie Carragher 2011 Aidy Boothroyd 2011 Dion Dublin 2010, 2019, 2020, 2021 Graeme Sharp 2010, 2012, 2013 Iain Dowie 2009–2021 Paul Jewell 2009–2017 Scott Minto 2008–2012 Billy Davies 2008 Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink 2008 Tony Gale 2006–2021 Ian Rush 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 Peter Beagrie 2006, 2008, 2009–2010 Peter Reid 2006–2007 Paul Walsh 2005–2021 Neil Warnock 2005, 2014, 2020, 2022 John Salako 2005–2013 John Aldridge 2005, 2010–2011 Matt Le Tissier 2004–2020 John Gregory 2004–2005 Tony Cottee 2003–2021 David Ginola 2003 Brian Little 2003 Jan Molby 2003 Lou Macari 2003 George Burley 2003, 2005, 2006 Gordon McQueen 2003–2011 Nigel Spackman 2002–2004 Chris Coleman 2001, 2010 Charlie Nicholas 2000–2020 Alan Mullery 2000–2004 Mark McGhee 2000, 2006 Chris Kamara 1999–2021 Phil Thompson 1998–2020 Frank McLintock 1998–2006 Rodney Marsh 1998–2004 George Best 1998–2004 Clive Allen 1998–2001\n\nMain Presenters and Analysts gallery\n\nSimon Thomas (2023–present)\n\nPaul Merson (2006–present)\n\nClinton Morrison (2018–present)\n\nMichael Dawson (2017–present)\n\nLee Hendrie (2020–present)\n\nKris Boyd (2020–present)\n\nMatt Murray (2012–present)\n\nAlan McInally (1998–present)\n\nSue Smith (2018–present)\n\nJamie Mackie (2020–present)\n\nTim Sherwood (2020–present)\n\nJobi McAnuff (2021–present)\n\nMike Dean (2023–present)\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Apple TV+ series Ted Lasso, character Roy Kent serves as a pundit on the show alongside Stelling and Kamara.[10]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFinal Score, a similar programme which is broadcast by the BBC\n\nBT Sport Score, a similar programme, broadcast by BT Sport from 2016 to 2023\n\nThe Goal Rush, a football results programme broadcast by ITV from 2001 to 2003\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
