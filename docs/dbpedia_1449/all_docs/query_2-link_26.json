        "text": "In this photo, you can see a 1.7 water-water engine in a crate with some clear accident damage to the right side. The intake manifold is badly bent. This indeed indicates that this engine was installed in the car at the time of the crash.\n\nHere's a close-up shot of the damaged intakes. On the car right now, it appears that they cut off one pipe and rewelded\n\nit, and then simply tapped out the other from the inside.\n\nHere's a really neat photo showing the original 962-106b chassis assembled with the rollbar on a jig. This is one of my favorite photos. The chassis clearly shows the \"battle scars\" in the front, particularly where the windscreen mounts. You can see the new panels that were attached to the rear of the chassis during the repair process (shiny looking). The rear panels behind the seat were replaced. This is difficult, painstaking work that requires a lot of patience. Supposedly, the assembly of the car to get it to it's current state (85% complete) took four years.\n\nThis is also a neat shot. Here the engine has been installed and they are starting to hang the suspension on the car. The 962 chassis consists of only the front part of the car - the engine and transmission assembly actually are structural members of the chassis and support the weight of the car. This was done to save weight and increase stiffness.\n\nAnother shot of the chassis on the stands:\n\nHere's another neat shot of the complete chassis with the engine installed (no bodywork):\n\nSo, as mentioned previously, Bonhams had both cars for sale at the Quail auction, and they also brought them back to the auction block at Scottsdale at the request of the present owner. It was at this time that I decided to take a closer in-person exhaustive inspection of both cars, to see if I could verify some of the things I saw in the photos, and get some type of confirmation of the following:\n\n- The engine in the \"original chassis car\" was stated to be new / rebuilt from new parts acquired from Porsche Motorsports.\n\n- The chassis was indeed the original chassis of 962GTi-106b that was damaged and then repaired.\n\nDiscussing the condition of the engine first - I wanted to inspect the motor firsthand to see if I could tell if the parts inside were new (or newish) as stated. The auction company was provided with a description as such, but there was no backup documentation that we could obtain to assist in the verification. When you're talking about engines that Porsche Motorsports charges $150K to rebuild, you want to try your hardest to make sure that the real thing is in the car. Besides, it was obvious that the transmission in the \"original chassis car\" was empty and didn't contain any internals because the gearshift input into the transmission wasn't connected to anything. I wanted to make sure that the engine case wasn't empty as well.I did have these very convincing photos that were provided to me by the owner:\n\nBut of course, these could be photos of any motor. So, I went out to Scottsdale with my borescope to have a look inside the engine. For those of you who haven't used one of these before, they are fiber optic inspection scopes similar to the ones they use during a colonoscopy. Fortunately, my scope has only been used to look inside engines and in crevices in my attic. Here's a photo for reference:\n\nBasically, you take the spark plugs out of the car, stick the scope in, and take a look at the pistons, the valves, and the cylinder walls. I unfortunately was not able to take any photos of what the engine actually looks like inside, as I would need two people to do that, and I was by myself. The bottomline is that the engine looked like it was assembled from all new parts. It did look like it had been run at least for a very short time (dyno time?) as the spark plugs did have some very light soot / discoloration on them. But they were basically brand new, and they also where nice and neatly labeled one through six, which is a good sign. For those of you who have read my Engine Rebuilding book, you know that I advocate excruciatingly fine detail in making sure everything is clean and assembled properly. Finding spark plugs labeled is a good sign of an anal-retentive engine builder!\n\nI also verified that the engine shown in the photos is the same one that was installed in the car. There were a variety of obvious clues - the labels on the wire harness were the same and written in Japanese, and the same components that were on the engine in the photos were on the engine in the car (nothing added and nothing removed). The engine in front of me matched the one in this photo exactly:\n\nYou could also tell that the intakes had been repaired, just like they were in the photo. With my inspection of everything in place, I was now confident that the engine was as represented. I still had to take a gamble that the assembler of the engine actually did a good job on the assembly, but that of course is a risk you have to take.\n\nPart 2 of my inspection was of course to determine to the best of my knowledge if the chassis was indeed a \"test\" chassis, or the original German chassis from 1987. While there is no sticker or VIN on the chassis that actually says \"this is the original German chassis from 1987\", one can take steps to try to verify the authenticity of the current owner's remarks. The first question was as to whether the chassis in front of me was indeed used as a spare chassis (never run), or if it was indeed the repaired chassis in the photos. There were a large number of signs that the chassis had been run and raced previously, and was not a \"new off the shelf\" item. Little things, like the accelerator cable mounts - these were not installed on the \"original chassis\", but there were still significant signs of wear there.\n\nIn this photo, you can see where the accelerator linkage mount used to be connected to the chassis. The outline and wear from the square mount is visible (indicated by the yellow arrow):\n\nOn the \"Japan Car\", you can see the same area where the cable is mounted, and the same clip that is used to attach it to the chassis:\n\nI found several instances like this. In particular, I took the photo of the crashed chassis in the back of the pickup truck and compared markings / scratches on it to the chassis that was in front of me. For reference again, here's the crashed tub photo. The yellow arrow points to distinctive wear marks on the tub corresponding to the four holes in the side. The green arrow points to a distinctive \"palm tree like\" wear mark on the side.\n\nI thought I had a much better photo of the opposite side on the \"original car\", but this one is the only one I have right now for some reason. It does show the various holes and wear marks that are present in the chassis on the pickup truck, leading me to conclude that they are one and the same. I haven't been able to find any instances where there are marks / details on the damaged chassis that aren't on the \"original chassis\" that I inspected. The green arrow points to the same \"palm tree like\" marking on the car. It's a bad photo, but from a different angle it's clear that it's the same mark (caused by some rubbing from the \"fake passenger seat\" at one time apparently). Here's another shot of the pedal cluster area (the car is missing the pedals). It clearly shows where they were mounted at one time and the associated wear marks."
