For the 2002–03 season, Dempsey spent a season at Lackawanna College where he guided the team the NJCAA Division II title game and a 33–4 overall record.\n\nRider\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey joined the coaching staff at Rider as an assistant in 2003, serving in the position for two seasons before being elevated to head coach during the 2005–06 season as the Broncs went 8–20. The team doubled its win total a year later and by his third year at the helm, Rider recorded a school record 23-win season with the help of future NBA first round pick Jason Thompson. Over the next four years, Dempsey had 82 wins, which was the most in Rider history, while also guiding the team to three postseason appearances.\n\nDempsey compiled a 119–105 record in seven seasons at Rider.\n\nBinghamton\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey was hired at Binghamton in May 2012, taking over for Mark Macon, inheriting a team that went 2–29 in 2011–12. After nine seasons and a 72–194 overall record, Dempsey's contract was not renewed.[3]\n\nHead coaching record\n\n[edit]\n\nCollege\n\n[edit]\n\nStatistics overview Season Team Overall Conference Standing Postseason Keystone College (EPCC) (2000–2002) 2000–01 Keystone 26–4 N/A N/A 2001–02 Keystone 29–4 N/A N/A NJCAA Final Four Keystone: 55–8 (.873) N/A Lackawanna College (Garden State Athletic Conference) (2002–2003) 2002–03 Lackawanna 33–4 N/A N/A NJCAA Runner Up Lackawanna: 33–4 (.892) N/A Rider (MAAC) (2005–2012) 2005–06 Rider 8–20 4–14 10th 2006–07 Rider 16–15 9–9 7th 2007–08 Rider 23–11 13–5 T-1st CBI First Round 2008–09 Rider 19–13 12–6 3rd CIT First Round 2009–10 Rider 17–16 9–9 6th 2010–11 Rider 23–11 13–5 2nd CIT First Round 2011–12 Rider 13–19 10–8 5th Rider: 119–105 (.531) 70–56 (.556) Binghamton (America East Conference) (2012–2021) 2012–13 Binghamton 3–27 1–15 9th 2013–14 Binghamton 7–23 4–12 7th 2014–15 Binghamton 6–26 5–11 7th 2015–16 Binghamton 8–22 5–11 6th 2016–17 Binghamton 12–20 3–13 T–8th 2017–18 Binghamton 11–20 2–14 9th 2018–19 Binghamton 10–23 5–11 7th 2019–20 Binghamton 10–19 4–12 9th 2020–21 Binghamton 4–14 4–10 9th Binghamton: 72–194 (.271) 34–108 (.239) Total: 279–310 (.474)\n\nNational champion Postseason invitational champion\n\nConference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nDivision regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nConference tournament champion"
