The series is hosted, written and produced by Ridgen and mixed by Cesil Fernandes. The series is also produced by Chris Oke and executive producer Arif Noorani.[1]\n\nUsing investigative journalism, Ridgen narrates a nonfiction story about a criminal cold case over multiple episodes. Episodes are released on a weekly basis; most of the Season 1 episodes ranged from 15 to 40 minutes in length,[2] with Season 2 episodes ranging between 32 and 80 minutes in length. Season 4 was released in February 2018.[3] Season 5 began in October 2018.[4]\n\nSomeone Knows Something is Ridgen's first podcast experience;[2] it is also CBC Radio's first true-crime podcast.\n\nEpisodes of Someone Knows Something are also sometimes broadcast on CBC Radio One as substitute programming, such as on public holidays and during the summer when some of its regular shows are on hiatus.\n\nSeries overview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first season of SKS focuses on the June 12, 1972, disappearance of Adrien McNaughton, a five-year-old boy who vanished during a family fishing trip in Eastern Ontario. The McNaughton family is from Arnprior, Ontario, where Ridgen grew up (he and his family moved there shortly after Adrien's disappearance).[5]\n\nThe second season follows the disappearance of Sheryl Sheppard in Hamilton, Ontario. Sheppard went missing on January 2, 1998, two days after her boyfriend, Michael Lavoie, offered a proposal of marriage on a live TV broadcast.[6] With some assistance from Sheppard's mother, Odette Fisher, Ridgen looks into the case as well as the backgrounds of both Sheryl and Michael, who has been the only person the Hamilton Police Service has named as a suspect in Sheryl's disappearance.[7]\n\nSeason 3 of SKS, all six episodes of which were released during the week of November 7, 2017, revisits the 1964 deaths of two teenagers in Mississippi, Charles Moore and Henry Dee; Ridgen previously explored the cold case in a 2007 documentary for CBC, Mississippi Cold Case, which resulted in a re-opening of the case and the eventual conviction of James Ford Seale for the abductions of Moore and Dee.\n\nIn early 2018, Season 4 explored another murder Ridgen had documented for CBC, that of Wayne Greavette, who was killed through the use of a flashlight bomb sent to him in the mail.[8]\n\nSeason 5 premiered in October 2018 focusing on the 1986 rape and murder of Kerrie Ann Brown in Thompson, Manitoba.[9]\n\nSeason 6 premiered in May 2020, Donald Izzett Jr. disappeared on Mother's Day 1995.[10]\n\nSeason 7 premiered on May 14, 2023 and it focuses on the 1998 murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a doctor who was performing abortions. He was murdered by James Charles Kopp an affiliate of the militant Roman Catholic anti-abotion group, The Lambs of Christ. It also goes into how Kopp maybe connected to three similar shootings that happened in Canada.[11]\n\nSeason 8 premiered on September 18, 2023. it focuses on the 2007 unsolved disappearance and murder of eighteen-year-old Angel Carlick from Whitehorse, Yukon.[12]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.TitleLength (minutes:seconds)Original air date0\"Prologue: 'Do it, David.
