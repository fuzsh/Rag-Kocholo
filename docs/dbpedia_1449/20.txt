MANCHESTER UNITED arrived in Perth, hoping for a nice start to their pre-season tour in Australia.

But it took a turn for the worse after a member of staff was admitted to hospital.

Who is Mark Dempsey?

Dempsey hails from Crumpsall in the Manchester area and was born on January 14, 1964.

He joined United's academy in 1980, going onto spend six years at the club - but only ever made one league appearance.

He later starred for Swindon, Sheffield United, Chesterfield, Rotherham and Macclesfield before ending his career in 1994.

It took the former midfielder some time to get into coaching, starting out in Man United's youth set up.

After heading to Tromso for work in 2009, he joined up with another ex-Devil in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Molde.

He followed the Norwegian to Cardiff City before returning to Scandinavia for more managerial opportunities - the first of which came at Haugesund in Norway.

After spells at Djurgarden, Start and Kongsvinger as manager and a return to Molde as assistant, Dempsey was reunited with Solskjaer and Man United as first team coach in December last year.

What is Dempsey's condition in hospital?

It was reported that a member of United's travelling staff had been taken to hospital with a 'suspected overdose', but it is now understood that Dempsey was admitted due to exhaustion.
