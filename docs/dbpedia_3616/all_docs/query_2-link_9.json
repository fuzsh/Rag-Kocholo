        "text": "Louis De France (born Nov. 1, 1661—died April 14, 1711, Meudon, Fr.) was the son of Louis XIV and Marie-Thérèse of Austria. His death preceded his father’s, and the French crown went to his own grandson, Louis XV. In 1688 he received nominal command of the French armies in Germany, led by Vauban, but throughout his life he depended on the favours of his strong-willed father and acquired a reputation for timidity, subservience, and—despite an education under the philosopher Bossuet—general mediocrity.\n\nHe married (1680) Marie-Anne-Christine-Victoire of Bavaria (d. 1690) and had three sons: Louis, duc de Bourgogne (1682–1712), who himself was dauphin for two years (1711–12) and was the father of Louis XV; Philippe, duc d’Anjou (1683–1746), who became King Philip V of Spain; and Charles, duc de Berry (1686–1714)."
