        "text": "Installed on the second floor at Versailles in sumptuous apartments spread across 35m2, she was surrounded by luxuries. Part of her 14 rooms, was a bathroom with two tubs, one for washing and one for rinsing, and, reportedly, there was even running hot and cold water, unheard of in those days. There were several entrances to the numerous reception rooms, including one stairway that connected directly with the king’s chambers just below her own on the first floor. And so, at the age of 26, beautiful Madame du Barry became King Louis XV’s last maitresse-en-titre, his chief mistress, and the most powerful woman in France.\n\nClearly, this orchestrated rise to fame, riches and, more importantly, influence, did not sit well with others at court. Her beauty caused much jealousy and alienated potential friends, while her influence over the king angered the various statesmen, who wanted such power for themselves.\n\nLead photo credit : Madame du Barry in a portrait by Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, 1782."
