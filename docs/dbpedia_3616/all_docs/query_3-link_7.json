It is a known fact that he was the favourite child of his parents, said to be handsome and bright.\n\nHe was put in the care of Marie Isabelle de Rohan and given the title of Duke of Burgundy by his grandfather, King Louis XV. He was much loved by those who were close to him, especially his older sister Marie Zéphyrine, who died at the age of five in 1755. The absence of his older sister was felt by the Duke.\n\nThe young Duke was pushed off a wooden horse by one of his playmates in 1759. As he was recognized for his kindness, he did not tell anyone about this, in order to prevent his friend from getting into any trouble. After this incident, the Duke of Burgundy's health started to deteriorate quickly. The family's physicist, Dr. Barbier, decided to operate on him in 1760. The Duke was very brave, as he was operated on while he was conscious. Knowing that he would die, the Dauphin had him baptised on 29 November 1760, with Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska, his grandparents, as his godparents. Until that moment, he had been known just as \"Burgundy\". By 1761, the Duke was bound to his bed, unable to move his legs. Dr. Barier diagnosed him with tuberculosis of the bone. He died on 22 March.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nchild->parent relationship with Louis, Dauphin of France (1729) (born 4 September 1729)\n\nchild->parent relationship with Maria Josepha, Dauphine of France (born 4 November 1731)\n\nsibling relationship with Charles X, King of France (born 9 October 1757)\n\nsibling relationship with Elisabeth, Princess of France (born 3 May 1764)\n\nsibling relationship with Louis XVI, King of France (born 23 August 1754)\n\nsibling relationship with Louis XVIII, King of France (born 17 November 1755)\n\nsibling relationship with Marie Clotilde, Princess of France (born 23 September 1759)\n\nsibling relationship with Marie Zéphyrine, Princess of France (born 26 August 1750)\n\nsibling relationship with Marie-Thérèse, Princess of France (born 19 July 1746).
