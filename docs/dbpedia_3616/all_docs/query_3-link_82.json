        "text": "Full Name: Called Louis the Prudent\n\nProfession: King of France\n\nBiography: Nicknamed 'the Prudent\" Louis XI inherited a country from his father Charles VI that was weak and besieged by forces from outside the kingdom and within. By the time of his death in 1453 Louis was able to leave behind a more prosperous expanded Kingdom.\n\nLouis's relationship with his father was a fractious one. At just 16 Louis took part in an uprising against Charles, the Praguerie, which failed. His father officially forgave him and he was given The Dauphiné, then separate from France, to administrate.\n\nDuring his reign Louis was known for his scheming and for his constant travel throughout the kingdom. His organisation of the royal postal routes strengthened communications across the kingdom. He also abolished the Pragmatic Sanction, ensuring the Papacy could have little control over the Gallic church.\n\nLouis' other achievements included finally ending the Hundred Years' War with England by signing the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475 with Edward IV. After the death of his sworn enemy Charles, Duke of Burgundy, Louis was also able to absorb the Duchy of Burgundy into the crown.\n\nBorn: July 3, 1423\n\nBirthplace: Bourges, France\n\nStar Sign: Cancer\n\nDied: August 30, 1483 (aged 60)\n\nArticles and Photos\n\nBattle of Nancy\n\nThe corpse of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, is discovered after the Battle of Nancy\n\nHistorical Events\n\nLouis XI is crowned King of France at Reims cathedral after the death of his father Charles VII\n\nFrench King Louis XI forms postal service\n\nBattle at Montlhéry between Louis XI and the League of the Public Weal\n\nFrench King Louis XI signs peace with Charles the Stout\n\nTreaty of Peronne: Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy and French King Louis XI (held under duress) confirm the Treaty of Arras of 1435, Treaty of Conflans of 1465 and limited territorial gains for the Duke of Burgundy\n\nPeace Treaty of Picquigny: King Louis XI buys English contacts\n\nBattle of Guinegate: Burgundians led by Archduke of Austria Maximilian I defeat the army of King of France Louis XI\n\nThe Peace of Atrecht (now Arras) concluded between Louis XI of France and Maximilian of Austria, ending the War of the Burgundian Succession\n\nPersonal Life\n\nLouis, dauphin of France (later Louis XI) (27) marries Charlotte of Savoy (9) without the consent of King Charles VII\n\nFamous Kings"
