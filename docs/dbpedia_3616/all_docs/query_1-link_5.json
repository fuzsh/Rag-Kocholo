        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe first of the many French kings to bear the name Louis was actually Clovis. He ruled from 481 to 511 and founded the kingdom of the Franks. Later the “C” was dropped and the “v” was written as “u,” thus making the name Louis. It is the same as the English Lewis and the German Ludwig.\n\nLouis the Pious\n\n(born 778, ruled 814–40). Louis the Pious is usually reckoned as Louis I. The son of Charlemagne, he succeeded his father as king of the Franks and Holy Roman emperor. The great empire built up by Charlemagne was divided after Louis I died, and the next four rulers of this name left little mark on the course of history.\n\nLouis VI, the Fat\n\n(born 1081, ruled 1108–37). Louis the Fat was the first important king of the Capetian line. This line sprang from Hugh Capet, who became king in 987. Louis the Fat was a great fighter, a great hunter, and a great eater. At 46 he became too fat to mount a horse, but he remained the embodiment of warlike energy. His great task was to reduce to order the petty nobles of the royal domain, who could truly be called robber barons. When Louis came to the throne, every lord of a castle robbed at will and it was not safe for even the king to pass along the road. Twenty years of hard fighting were necessary to remedy this condition, but in the end, law and order prevailed. So that such evils might not recur, every castle that was captured was destroyed or given to faithful followers.\n\nLouis VII\n\n(born 1120, ruled 1137–80). Louis VII was the eldest son of Louis VI. Shortly before his death, Louis VI arranged for his son’s marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine. By this marriage southwest France was added to the domains of the new French king. Unfortunately Louis, who was very religious and prone to be jealous, soon discovered that his beautiful queen was a capricious flirt.\n\nIn 1147 Louis departed for the Holy Land on the Second Crusade, taking his queen with him. This Crusade was a miserable failure. After they returned, Louis had his marriage annulled in 1152. Eleanor at once sent an embassy to Henry, count of Anjou and duke of Normandy, proposing marriage. Henry was overjoyed because the alliance transferred to him the great duchy of Guienne. Two years later Henry and Eleanor were crowned king and queen of England. France thus lost a rich territory to England, its greatest rival.\n\nLouis VIII\n\n(born 1187, ruled 1223–26). The son of Philip Augustus, Louis VIII reigned too short a time to accomplish anything of real importance.\n\nLouis IX\n\n(born 1214, ruled 1226–70). Called St. Louis, Louis IX was one of the most virtuous and heroic kings of France. He was the dutiful son of Louis VIII and his queen, Blanche of Castile. Blanche bravely faced numerous revolts of powerful feudal nobles during her son’s youth. Louis IX had all the good qualities and few of the bad ones of the age in which he lived. Indeed, his virtues were so remarkable that after his death the Roman Catholic church declared him a saint.\n\nLouis’s acts of piety, such as wearing a haircloth shirt, fasting, and waiting on lepers, were usually performed in private. To the world he was a fearless knight, thoroughly trained in the art of war, and a conscientious, just, and able king—usually good-humored and kindly, but at times impatient and angry. He was a strong ruler who greatly strengthened the royal power. He improved the government by appointing local officials who were responsible to him for the administration of justice, the collection of taxes, and the government of their districts. He encouraged the people to appeal to him if the nobles oppressed them or if his officials were unjust. He improved the administration of justice by abolishing trials by combat and by using in his courts the new lawyers, trained in the Roman law, in place of the churchmen who formerly were the only people who could read and write. These reforms not only benefited the peasants but also checked the power of the nobles, who, according to a writer of the time, “undertook nothing against their king, seeing clearly that the hand of the Lord was with him.”\n\nSt. Louis made two crusades—to Egypt and the Holy Land, from 1248 to 1254, on which he was captured and held for ransom by Muhammadans; and to Tunis, in 1270, where he died of the plague.\n\nLouis X\n\n(born 1289). Louis X ruled for only two years, from 1314 to 1316.\n\nLouis XI\n\n(born 1423, ruled 1461–83). Louis XI presented a striking contrast to Louis IX. In appearance Louis XI was ugly and unkingly; in character he was unscrupulous and underhanded. Like his contemporaries, Cesare Borgia and Richard III, he was an embodiment of the principles that are called Machiavellian. He believed that “he who has success has honor” and cared nothing for the way in which he attained success. He made promises only to break them, unless he had sworn by one particular saint: then his word was good.\n\nHis one ambition seemed to be to extend the boundaries of France. Although he was too stingy to buy a hat to replace the shabby one he wore, he spent large sums in buying back border cities. In his conflicts with the nobles, especially with Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, he also acquired much territory, so that by the time of his death most of the land of France was under the direct control of the king. The power of the crown in the latter part of his reign was truly absolute over the territory it held.\n\nSir Walter Scott, in his novel Quentin Durward, gives a fine description of the court of Louis XI, as well as an excellent survey of the customs and traditions of the period.\n\nLouis XII\n\n(born 1462, ruled 1498–1515). Louis XII is chiefly noted for the Italian wars, begun by his predecessor, Charles VIII, and continued after the reign of Louis XII by Francis I.\n\nLouis XIII\n\n(born 1601, ruled 1610–43). Louis XIII kept his able minister, Richelieu, in power for 18 years despite strong opposition. The first years of the reign were filled with anarchy and disorder. The king was a child, and his mother, who ruled for him, was weak and selfish. When Richelieu came into power, however, all this was changed. The Huguenots were reduced from a powerful political party to a mere religious body, and the nobles were humbled. National unity and religious peace were secured at home, and France was raised to the first position among the powers of Europe.\n\nLouis XIV\n\n(born 1638, ruled 1643–1715). Louis XIV inherited this power from his father and carried it further. He was styled the Grand Monarch, and his brilliant court at Versailles became the model and the despair of other less rich and powerful princes, who accepted his theory of absolute monarchy (L’état c’est moi, “I am the state”). Until 1661 the government was largely in the hands of the wily Italian Cardinal Mazarin. At the cardinal’s death Louis declared that he would be his own prime minister. From then on he worked faithfully at his “trade of a king.”\n\nA passion for fame and the desire to increase French territory in Europe were the leading motives of Louis XIV. He neglected the opportunities to gain an empire in America and India and involved France in wars that ruined the country financially and paved the way for the outbreak of the French Revolution.\n\nHis first war, fought from 1667 to 1668, was an attempt to enforce flimsy claims to part of the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium). His second (1672–78) was directed against “their High Mightinesses,” the States-General of Holland, who had blocked his objective in the first contest. In spite of the great military power of France, the Dutch admiral De Ruyter twice defeated the fleets of the French and their English allies, and Louis XIV failed ingloriously in his attempt to conquer Holland. The third war (1689–97) also was directed chiefly against Holland, whose stadholder had by then become King William III of England. The German province of the Palatinate was terribly wasted, but the Peace of Ryswick brought only slight gains for France. Louis’s last and greatest effort was the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–13). In this conflict the English duke of Marlborough was the principal leader of the opposing European coalition. The right to seat his grandson Philip V on the throne of Spain was small compensation for the thousands of lives and the millions in treasure that the French king wasted in the struggle.\n\nMillions more were spent by Louis in building the beautiful palace at Versailles, near Paris, and in maintaining his brilliant court. There, etiquette became the “real constitution of France.” It required seven persons, some of them the highest princes of the realm, to put the king’s shirt on him at his getting up (levée) in the morning. A French historian says of Louis XIV: “He was a god in his temple, celebrating his own worship in the midst of his host of priests and faithful.” This extravagance of the court meant a heavy burden of taxation for the common people, who were thereby reduced to a misery so great that they eventually rose up in rebellion and drove the Bourbons from the throne.\n\nLouis XIV had the distinction of ruling longer than any other European king: it was 72 years from the time when he ascended the throne, as a child of less than 5, until his death in 1715. The Grand Monarch, who had outlived both his son and his son’s son, was succeeded by his 5-year-old great-grandson, Louis XV, the last son of the duke of Burgundy.\n\nLouis XV\n\n(born 1710, ruled 1715–74). The luxurious court of Louis XIV was continued under Louis XV. The evils from which the country suffered were clearly recognized, but by the time the king grew up he was too lazy and selfish to try to remedy them. Misgovernment was common at home, and the position of France abroad was lowered by the loss of its colonial possessions in India and America. These misfortunes, however, made little impression on the king, whose attitude was expressed in the phrase, “After me the deluge!”\n\nLouis XVI\n\n(born 1754, ruled 1774–92). The storm broke during the reign of Louis XVI. Awkward and timid, no man could have appeared less like a king than did Louis XVI, who was 20 years old when he came to the throne. No man could have seemed more out of place in the brilliant and polished court of which he was the center. Louis realized this and often wished, even before the Revolution, that he were only a common man. He was a good horseman, fond of hunting, and he delighted in making and mending locks. His greatest fault was that he was always ready to listen to and follow the advice of others. When this advice was good, all went well; but in the latter part of Louis’s reign the advice was bad and it cost the king his life.\n\nWhen Louis XVI first came to the throne, he entrusted the management of the finances of the kingdom to Jacques Turgot, one of the greatest of statesmen. As long as the king followed his minister’s advice, the state of the kingdom was improved. But he was more often under the influence of the beautiful but frivolous and extravagant queen, Marie Antoinette. He was also swayed by his selfish courtiers, who opposed any financial reforms that would threaten their graft and pensions and life of ease. They soon persuaded the king to dismiss his able minister.\n\nThe political climate gradually grew worse, and finally Louis XVI was forced to call the Estates-General, a body that had not met since 1614. Its meeting was the first step in the French Revolution. The members of the Third Estate refused to follow the old method of voting and finally declared themselves a national assembly.\n\nAt first the king seemed inclined to work with the revolution and to try to remedy conditions in the country. But the influence of the queen and of the courtiers proved too strong for his weak will. Encouraged by them, he disregarded the promises he had made and sought to flee from France in order to obtain aid against the revolution from Austria.\n\nThis attempted flight was the beginning of the end for the court of Louis XVI. The people saw that they could not trust the king and the “Austrian woman,” as they called the queen. His disregard of his promises to abide by the constitution led to the storming of the royal palace of the Tuileries on August 10, 1792. The king and his family escaped before the mob arrived and took refuge in the hall of the Legislative Assembly. The assembly declared that the king was suspended from office and ordered that he and his family should be imprisoned. They then called a new assembly (the Convention) to decide whether France should continue to be a monarchy.\n\nThe Convention first decided against a monarchy and declared the king deposed. They then brought Louis XVI to trial on the charge of conspiring with foreign countries for the invasion of France. Almost unanimously Louis Capet, as he was now called, was declared guilty and was sentenced to death. Consequently, the next day he was beheaded, meeting his fate with a steadfast courage, according to accounts, and proving greater in death than he had ever been in life. His execution had important consequences for France, because it aroused opinion in other countries against the French Revolution.\n\nLouis XVII\n\n(born 1785). Louis XVII, the Dauphin, never had the opportunity to rule France. He was imprisoned with his parents, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, when he was 7. According to the French government, he died at the age of 10.\n\nLouis XVIII\n\n(born 1755, ruled 1814–24). When the Bourbons returned to the throne of France in 1814, the younger brother of Louis XVI assumed the crown as Louis XVIII. The difficult task of reconstruction was before the king, but he seemed admirably adapted to meet the situation. He was cold-blooded and cared nothing for revenge; therefore he was satisfied to leave alone those who had driven his family from France. He was a lazy man, and his one ambition was to keep his throne. This ambition at first seemed likely to go unfulfilled, for in 1815 Napoleon returned from exile on the island of Elba, and Louis XVIII fled in a panic from France. At the end of the period known as the Hundred Days, however, Napoleon was again overthrown, at Waterloo, and the Allies entered Paris, “bringing Louis XVIII in their baggage.”\n\nUntil 1820 the king was able to resist the demands of the extreme royalists for vengeance and to build up his kingdom, but finally, under the leadership of his brother, they became too strong for him. He yielded to their demands for a reactionary government. This marked the beginning of the end of the Bourbons; ten years later, under his brother, Charles X, they were finally driven from the throne of France.\n\nLouis-Philippe\n\n(born 1773, ruled 1830–48). Having disposed of the old Bourbons, the French had to set up a new government. Influenced by Lafayette, they decided to perpetuate the French monarchy with Louis-Philippe, a member of the Orléans family. He accepted the crown on August 9, 1830.\n\nLouis-Philippe was known for his democratic ideas, but his government was not democratic. Demands for a more liberal government were not met.\n\nWhen the government forbade a banquet organized by supporters of political reform, which was to be held on February 22, 1848, the Republicans of Paris revolted. The prime minister, François Guizot, was forced to resign. This did not satisfy the rioters, however, and Louis-Philippe abdicated on February 24. He fled to England, where he died two years later."
