Familiar Short Sayings of Great Men. 1887.\n\nDuke of Burgundy\n\n[Grandson of Louis XIV., and father of Louis XV.; born at Versailles, 1682. Fénelon was appointed his tutor, and effected an entire change in his character, which, from being obstinate and passionate, became humble and gentle. The duke and duchess died of malignant small-pox in 1712, greatly regretted by the nation.]\n\nWhat, do kings die? (Quoi, donc, les rois meurent-ils?)\n\nTo Fénelon, who spoke of a certain king as dead. The question illustrates the education of princes of that period. Thus the grandfather of Philip Égalité, Duc d’Orleans, started up in indignation, when his secretary stumbled, in reading, on the words, “the late king of Spain” (feu roi d’Espagne). “Monseigneur,” hastily answered the trembling but adroit man of business, “’tis a title they take!” (c’est un titre qu’ils prennent!)—CARLYLE: French Revolution, I. 1, 4."
