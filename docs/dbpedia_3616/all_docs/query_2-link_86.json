For the first time, communities of knights gathered around a grand master to create institutions that served an ideal.\n\nThe Order of Saint John of Jerusalem originated in a religious hospital foundation established at the Holy Sepulcher around 1050. After the Siege of Jerusalem in 1099, the foundation became a chivalric order with a two-fold mission: to care for the sick and to fight the infidels. The Crusader States disappeared in 1291 and in 1310 the knights settled in Rhodes, which became the bastion of Christendom thanks to its powerful fleet. Driven out in 1523 after a heroic siege, they were granted the island of Malta by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; there, they pursued their maritime and hospitaller missions.\n\nLargely ruined by the French Revolution and driven out of its territory by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798, the Order settled permanently in Rome in 1834. As in its early days, it became exclusively involved in hospital and charity missions. It is a sovereign State and the Order is present worldwide.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe original insignia of the order was a white eight-pointed fabric cross sewn onto the knights’ cloaks. An enameled gold jewel appeared in the sixteenth century, which was standardized only at the end of the nineteenth century. The eight-pointed cross shape of this insignia inspired most of the French orders, from the Order of the Holy Spirit to the National Order of Merit.\n\nIllustration\n\nPanoramic view of the city of Valetta, 18th century\n\nEdward III founds the Order of the Garter\n\nAt the beginning of the Hundred Years’ War, c. 1348, the King of England, Edward III, claimed the French throne. He founded a political instrument of allegiance to his dynasty, the Most Noble Order of Saint George or of the Garter. The motto in French, Honi soit qui mal y pense (shame on him who thinks evil of it), and the blue and gold colors of the Order clearly indicate the Plantagenet’s claim to the kingdom of France.\n\nIts main characteristics, borrowed from chivalric and religious orders as well as from the legend of King Arthur and the Round Table, were adopted by almost all of the orders created during the sixteenth century. As such, it is considered to be the archetype of chivalric orders. It was awarded to nine French sovereigns: Francis I, Henry II, Charles IX, Henry III, Henry IV and in the nineteenth century, Louis XVIII, Charles X, Louis Philippe I and Napoleon III. It is still England’s most prestigious order.\n\nIllustrations\n\nTop, garter of the Duke of York (1763-1827)\n\nBottom, Queen Victoria gives the riband of the Order of the Garter to Louis Philippe I, King of the French.\n\nJohn II of France founds the Order of the Star\n\nIn 1351, King John the Good founded the Company of Knights of Our Lady of the Noble House, known as the Order of the Star, with the purpose of distinguishing a military elite in the difficult context of the Hundred Years War. The knights, who had sworn to never turn their backs on the enemy, were decimated in battle; thus the first French chivalric order did not survive the defeat of Poitiers in 1356.\n\nThe insignia was a ring and a clasp adorned with a star.\n\nIllustration\n\nKnight of the Order of the Star\n\nPhilip the Good, Duke of Burgundy founds the Order of the Golden Fleece\n\nPhilip III, the Duke of Burgundy, established the Order of the Golden Fleece in Bruges on January 10, 1430. This magnificent prince gathered an entourage of great lords around him, and affirmed his omnipotence over his cousin and sovereign, the King of France. He also asserted his independence from the King of England and his Order of the Garter, from which his own order was directly inspired. The symbolism of the new institution comes from the mythological story of Jason and his quest for the Golden Fleece.\n\nThe Order of the Golden Fleece was handed down to the House of Habsburg at the death of Duke Charles the Bold, and then to the Spanish monarchy by Charles Quint. After the War of the Spanish Succession, the order was divided into a Spanish Bourbon branch and an Austrian Habsburg branch.\n\nToday the Spanish Golden Fleece is the highest distinction that the King of Spain may confer. The Austrian Order is considered a legal entity under international law.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe insignia of the order is a collar with links representing fire strikers (the lighter of that period — Philip the Good’s personal emblem since 1421) and flints producing sparks. A ram’s hide, the legendary Golden Fleece, hangs from the collar. In daily life the insignia of the fleece is worn suspended from a red ribbon around the neck.\n\nIllustration\n\nLeopold I, Duke of Lorraine (1679-1729), in the attire of the Order of the Golden Fleece\n\nLouis XI founds the Order of Saint Michael\n\nLouis XI founded the Order of Saint Michael in Amboise on August 1, 1469, to gather the elite of the kingdom around him and reassert his sovereignty over the powerful Duke of Burgundy and the King of England. Michael the Archangel, whose figure had adorned the royal standards since the Hundred Years’ War and whose Mount had never been conquered was chosen as the order’s patron saint.\n\nLimited by statute to 36 men of noble birth bound by an oath of exclusive loyalty, the Order soon became the equal of its forerunners, the orders of the Garter and the Golden Fleece. Thanks to the political acumen of the King, it strengthened the prestige of the crown.\n\nHowever, after the death of Henry II and due to the disorder of the religious wars, it began to be awarded excessively and thus lost some of its prestige. Reformed by Henry III when he founded the Order of the Holy Spirit, it became the second royal order of the kingdom.\n\nKing Louis XIV once again restructured the order in 1665 and used it as a token of his recognition for the great servants of the State in the fields of the arts, letters and sciences. Abolished in 1791, it was reinstated by Louis XVIII, and finally discontinued by Louis Philippe I in 1830.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe insignia was composed of a badge depicting Saint Michael the Archangel slaying the dragon suspended from a collar made of scallop shells linked together by knots.\n\nThe Knights were required to wear the collar daily. In private or when hunting they were allowed to wear the pendant alone hung from a simple chain or a silk lace: the Small Order.\n\nIn 1665, Louis XIV had the pendant replaced with a cross to be worn on a black ribbon. It is similar to the cross of the knights of the Holy Spirit but with the effigy of Saint Michael the Archangel on both sides.\n\nIllustration\n\nBayard (1476-1524) wearing the collar of Saint Michael\n\nRenaissance\n\n1536\n\nCalvin published Institutes of the Christian Religion\n\nWars of religion in France 1562-1598\n\n1578\n\nHenry III founds the Order of the Holy Spirit +\n\n1608\n\nHenry IV founds the united Orders of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem +\n\nHenry III founds the Order of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe most prestigious order of the French monarchy, the Order of the Holy Spirit, was founded by Henry III on December 31, 1578. The sovereign, who became King of Poland, then King of France during the feasts of Pentecost in 1573 and 1574, showed his devotion to the Holy Spirit by naming the order after it.\n\nDesigned to defend the Catholic religion, it was also made to secure the loyalty of the kingdom’s elite, which had been divided by the Catholic League, to the King. The Order of Saint Michael could no longer play this unifying role as it had been had been too largely conferred by Charles IX.\n\nThe order was composed of one hundred noble Catholic knights appointed by the king, who were also knights of Saint Michael. It ceased to be awarded in 1789, was abolished in 1791, reinstated under the Restoration, and finally discontinued in 1830 by Louis Philippe I.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe statutes provide for a number of different insignia: the collar, reserved for ceremonies, was worn over a mantle; the dove of the Holy Spirit appears on the obverse side of a Maltese cross and Saint Michael the Archangel appears on the reverse side; an embroidered badge is sewn onto the coat. The ribbon is sky blue.\n\nIllustrations\n\nTop, Institution of the Order of the Holy Spirit by Henry III Jean-Baptiste Van Loo (1684-1745)\n\nBottom, badge of the Order of the Holy Spirit, Restoration era\n\nHenry IV founds the united Orders of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem\n\nIn 1608, Henry IV, as a token of the sincerity of his conversion to Catholicism, founded the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. He united it with the ancient Order of Saint Lazarus, founded at the time of the Crusades to care for lepers. It fell into disuse but was still rich with property. The last grand master was the Count of Provence. He did not restore the united orders when he became King Louis XVIII with the Restoration so it died out.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe insignia of the order was an eight-pointed cross with the image of the Virgin Mary on one side and Saint Lazarus on the other. It was accompanied by an embroidered badge. The Count of Provence had the amaranth ribbon changed to green at the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nIllustrations\n\nTop, cross of Commander of the United Orders\n\nBottom, the Count of Provence receives a knight of the United Orders\n\nAbsolute Monarchy to the French Revolution\n\nReign of Louis XIV 1643-1715\n\n1674\n\nThe Hôtel des Invalides was founded by Louis XIV to house and care for war invalids and veterans\n\n1693\n\nLouis XIV founds the Order of Saint Louis +\n\nReign of Louis XV 1715-1774\n\n1751\n\n1772\n\nThe Encyclopédie:\n\ndissemination of the ideas of the Enlightenment in France\n\n1759\n\nand\n\n1771\n\nLouis XV establishes the Institution of Military Merit and the Médaillon de Vétérance +\n\nFrench Revolution 1789-1799\n\n1791\n\nThe royal orders are abolished, except for the Order of Saint Louis and the Institution of Military Merit, called Military Decoration and discontinued in 1792.\n\n1797\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, General of the Army of Italy, has one hundred sabers made, each with bearing the name of the recipient.\n\nLouis XIV founds the Order of Saint Louis\n\nLouis XIV established the Order of Saint Louis on April 5, 1693 in Versailles, to reward virtue, merit and distinguished service of Catholic officers of the royal army who had served for more than ten years. The King thus created a new chivalry based on military merit; nobility was not a requirement for entry into the order.\n\nRanks were instituted: Knights, in numbers at the discretion of the Grand Master, Commanders and Grand Cross in limited numbers.\n\nThe Order of Saint Louis was the first order to recognize merit democratically and it became immensely prestigious in the armies. It was Napoleon Bonaparte’s model for the creation of the Legion of Honor.\n\nIt was briefly maintained during the Revolution under the name of Military Decoration and was abolished on October 15, 1792. Louis XVIII restored it and, like all the other orders of the Ancien Régime, Louis Philippe I put it to sleep.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe cross of Saint Louis, worn on the lapel of the suit jacket on a fire red ribbon, is similar to the cross of the Holy Spirit. The figure of Saint Louis is in the center; a palewise sword interlaced with a laurel wreath and the motto of the Order by Boileau: Bellicae virtutis praemium (reward for military valor) is on the back. Commanders and Grand Cross are distinguished by a larger cross worn on a sash; a badge for the Grand Cross.\n\nIllustration\n\nCross of Knight of the Order of Saint Louis\n\nLouis XV establishes the Institution of Military Merit and the Médaillon de Vétérance\n\nThe Institution of Military Merit\n\nLouis XV founded the Institution of Military Merit on May 10, 1759, in order to reward the valor of the Protestant foreign officers serving him. It copies the Order of Saint Louis, without the religious dimension. Its history is merged with that of the Order of Saint Louis.\n\nInsignia\n\nDerived form the cross of Saint Louis, the insignia of Military Merit has the palewise sword on the obverse and the laurel wreath on the reverse.\n\nMédaillon de Vétérance (Veteran’s Medal)\n\nLouis XV created a distinctive recognition of non-commissioned officers and soldiers who served him for more than 24 years, on April 16, 1771. The Medal of Veterancy was awarded in front of the entire regiment, along with an award certificate and an oath of loyalty to the King. The Revolution did not abolish this distinction, which was still awarded at the beginning of the First Republic.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe insignia consists of two crossed swords on a woolen cloth background, initially in the color of the uniform, then red.\n\nIllustrations\n\nTop, cross of a Knight of Military Merit\n\nBottom, Jean Thurel (1699-1807) wearing the triple Medal of Veterancy\n\nConsulate and Empire\n\nConsulate 1799-1804\n\n1799\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, First Consul, institutes the Weapons of Honor +\n\n1802\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, First Consul, founds the Legion of Honor +\n\nFirst Empire 1804-1814\n\n1805\n\nand\n\n1811\n\nNapoleon I initiates the Imperial orders of the Iron Crown and of the Reunion +\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, First Consul, institutes the Weapons of Honor\n\nThe Weapons of Reward was the predecessor of the institution of the Legion of Honor. The Directory recognized the need for national rewards, at least for military service, and began awarding signed weapons or flags in 1796. The number of weapons so awarded increased when Napoleon Bonaparte took command of the Italian armed forces: in 1797 he took the initiative of having one hundred name-bearing sabers made in Milan, with the inscription Army of Italy, given by General Bonaparte on behalf of the Executive Directory of the French Republic. The use of these rewards was codified by the commander-in-chief during the Egyptian campaign on February 2, 1799. One of the Directory’s last actions was to officially institute the Récompenses Nationales on October 3, 1799.\n\nAs First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte founded the Weapons of Honor based on these provisions, on December 25, 1799. The name-bearing weapons, awarded with a certificate signed by the First Consul, were divided into two classes:\n\nsabers, for officers and soldiers who carried out outstanding exploits;\n\ndifferent weapons, depending on the position of the recipient: guns for grenadiers and soldiers; carbines for cavalry; drumsticks for drummers; trumpets for trumpeters; grenades for cannoneers, to be sewn on the uniform; boarding axes for sailors, to be fastened to the harness.\n\nThe weapon recipients (around 2000) were ex officio members of the Legion of Honor and constituted the first cohort on September 24, 1803.\n\nIllustration\n\nCarbine of honor with the name of citizen Jean Lamps\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, First Consul, founds the Legion of Honor\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte founded the Legion of Honor on May 19, 1802, to unite military courage and civilian talent into one elite corps, and build the foundation of a new society in the service of the nation. Modern in its universality, traditional in its organization, the institution epitomized the visionary genius of its founder.\n\nA grand chancellor (Comte de Lacépède) was put in charge of the administration of the order, under the authority of the head of the Legion of Honor (the Head of State). The Legion was first divided into sixteen cohorts (dropped in 1809). The institution was composed of four ranks: legionnaire (called “Knight” as of 1808), Officer, Commander and Grand Officer.\n\nIn 1804, Napoleon, now emperor, established the insignia: a star with his effigy and the imperial eagle on the reverse with the motto Honneur et Patrie (honor and homeland). In 1805 the supreme title was created, the Grand Decoration, which was exchanged with the orders of European monarchies. The Emperor held the first two solemn award ceremonies at the Invalides and at the Camp de Boulogne on July 15 and then on August 16, 1804.\n\nThe Legion of Honor became an integral part of the history of the nation. Retained by Louis XVIII under the Restoration, it coexisted with the royal orders without losing its prestige. The profile of Henry IV and the fleurs-de-lis replaced the Emperor’s profile in the center of the insignia.\n\nIt became the sole national order under the July Monarchy; the tricolor flag was added to the reverse of the badge. It became more present in a society undergoing profound changes. Napoleonic symbolism reappeared on the insignia during the Second Republic and the Second Empire. Women were finally admitted which further extended its universality. The Third Republic gave its roots in the republican tradition and the Great War gave it a glorious popularity.\n\nFinally, the Code of 1962 restored the Order’s rigor while adapting the institution to the contemporary world, forming its definitive structure.\n\nIllustration\n\nEmpire style badge of Grand Aigle (great eagle) of the Legion of Honor, which belonged to Cambacérès (1753-1824)\n\nNapoleon I initiates the Imperial orders of the Iron Crown and of the Reunion\n\nOrder of the Iron Crown\n\nThe Order of the Iron Crown was founded on June 5, 1805, by Napoleon, King of Italy, who wore the insignia next to the Legion of Honor. An allusion to the crown of the Kings of the Lombards, said to contain the melted metal from a nail of the True Cross, this order was established to reward civil and military services rendered to the Italian crown. The Emperor paid attention to the insignia: an antique crown and the motto Dieu me l’a donnée, gare à qui la touche (God gave it to me; who touches it, beware). The ribbon was orange edged with green. It became an Austrian reward in 1814, and members had to trade in their insignia for a substitute jewel.\n\nOrder of the Reunion\n\nSubsequent to the extension of the Empire, the Order of the Reunion was founded by Napoleon on October 18, 1811, to be second to the Legion of Honor and replace all the orders of the annexed territories. The decoration symbolically illustrates the reunion [to the Empire] of Holland, the Hanseatic cities, Rome and Tuscany. The reverse contains the letter N and the motto A jamais (forever). Louis XVIII abolished this order on July 28, 1815.\n\nIllustrations\n\nTop, pendant of the Order of the Iron Crown awarded to Cambacérès (1753-1824)\n\nBottom, insignia of Commander of the Imperial Order of the Reunion\n\nConstitutional Monarchies\n\n1814\n\nKing Louis XVIII of France:\n\nrestoration of the former royal orders alongside the Legion of Honor\n\n1830\n\nLouis Philippe I, King of the French.\n\nThe Legion of Honor becomes the sole national order\n\nIIe Second Empire\n\nSecond Republic 1848-1852\n\n1852\n\nLouis-Napoleon Bonaparte, Prince-President creates the Médaille militaire +\n\nSecond Empire 1852-1870\n\n1857\n\nNapoleon III inaugurates the Saint Helena Commemoratives Medal by and the principle of campaign medals +\n\nLouis-Napoleon Bonaparte, Prince-President creates the Médaille militaire\n\nAs Napoleon Bonaparte had done in 1802, the then Prince-President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte associated himself with a reward institution by creating the Médaille militaire (Military Medal) on January 22, 1852.\n\nThis military medal was above all intended for the troops, too often ignored by the Legion of Honor. It has also been, by way of exception, since May 10, 1852 (date when marshals Reille and Vaillant received it), the supreme honor conferred upon victorious war leaders. This exceptional measure largely contributed to the popularity of the new insignia.\n\nA Republican order since September 4, 1870, it adapted to the requirements of its times, and its history faithfully follows the military events of France up to today. The Médaille militaire rewards both extraordinary feats in combat as well as lengthy service in the armed forces. It may be awarded to non-French citizens.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe insignia, silver by statute, is worn on a yellow and green ribbon, the colors of Napoleon’s Order of the Iron Crown. The portrait of the Prince-President, set in a laurel wreath, and the inscription Louis-Napoléon figures on the obverse of the medallion. An eagle with outstretched wings holding a suspension ring surmounts it. The motto, Valeur et Discipline (Valor and Discipline) is engraved on the reverse.\n\nIt was modified on November 8, 1870, so as to adjust to political changes. The Republic is represented by Ceres, topped by a trophy and the inscription République Française, 1870. This date was deleted in 1951 and replaced by a floral motif.\n\nIllustration\n\nMédaille militaire, Third Republic\n\nNapoleon III inaugurates the Saint Helena Commemoratives Medal by and the principle of campaign medals\n\nThe principle of a commemorative medal is that it is awarded to any officer or soldier who served during a given campaign; it is not a reward for noteworthy action. Napoleon III, inspired by British uses, introduced this type of medal to France after the Crimean War. The Saint Helena Medal, established by decree dated August 12, 1857, was France’s first commemorative medal. Conferred to all veterans of the Revolution and Empire armies, it replaced many unofficial veterans’ insignias.\n\nInsignia\n\nThe bronze medal, designed by Désiré Albert Barre, Chief Engraver of the Paris Mint, is topped by an imperial crown, and hangs from a green ribbon with five red stripes. On the obverse, the laurel-crowned profile of Napoleon I with the inscription Napoléon empereur; on the reverse: A ses compagnons de gloire, sa dernière pensée – Sainte-Hélène 5 mai 1821 (To his companions in glory, his last thoughts – Saint Helena, May 5, 1821) plus the epigraph Campagnes de 1792 à 1815 (Campaigns of 1792-1815).\n\nFollowing the Second Empire’s campaigns, three medals —Italy (1859), China (1861) and Mexico (1863)— were created by decision of Napoleon III. They were also made by Désiré Albert Barre on the same model, bearing on the obverse the laurel-crowned bust of the Emperor and on the reverse the names of the main battles of his campaigns. The governments of the Republic kept up the tradition of commemorative medals:\n\nCommemorative medals of the main colonial expeditions: Tonkin (1885), Madagascar (1886 and 1896), Dahomey (1892), China (1901), and Morocco (1909).\n\nColonial medal: created in 1893; French Overseas Medal as of 1962.\n\nCommemorative medals of conflicts: Franco-Prussian War of 1870, World Wars, Indochina, North Africa, etc. The most recent one is the Medal of the Nation’s Gratitude (Médaille de la Reconnaissance de la Nation), created en 2002.\n\nIllustration\n\nVice-Admiral Le Bris (1858-1949)"
