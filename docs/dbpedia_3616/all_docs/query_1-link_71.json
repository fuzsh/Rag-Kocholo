        "text": "Dukes of Burgundy\n\nBy successive diplomatic marriages, by victories and annexations, the Dukes of Burgundy, since the time of Jean the Fearless, had constituted a vast zone of power, which rivaled that of the kingdom of France. The zone consisted of different regions and people enclosing the kingdom of France, from North Lyon to south of Amiens forming a semi-circular realm reaching as far as the north of the Netherlands. This was the longest reign in the history of France. Some the most notable of the dukes were Charles the Bold and his father, Philip the Good.\n\nPhilip the Good enlarged his territory almost double its previous size. His lands included the duchy of Burgundy, Flanders, Artois, Babant, Luxembourg, Holland, Zeeland, Friesland, and Hainaut. Philip formed an allegiance with England, supporting the efforts of Henry V to secure the French crown until his subjects urged him to make peace with Charles VII of France. Philip founded the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1430. The Dukes of Burgundy placed at the order's disposal the resources of their enormous wealth. The order was formed to serve as a symbol of their power and be used to tie together the domains of the Burgundian State. The splendor of Burgundy during Philip's reign from 1396-1467 was unmatched in Europe.\n\nCharles the Bold reigned over Burgundy from 1467-77. He was the last heir of the dukes of Burgundy. His only child, Mary, became valuable as Europe's most marriageable heiress. Charles' surname (le Temeraine) really means \"the Rash\" and perhaps explains why he was a great antagonist of Louis XI. Although his Burgundian court surpassed that of monarchs of his time, he was lacking in the political realism of previous dukes. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Nancy in 1477.\n\nThe administration of the vast domain was put into the hands of Nicolas Rolin at the beginning of the fifteenth century. In the 81 years of his life Nicolas Rolin spent almost sixty years in service of the Duke of Burgundy. He was an excellent administrator and wise politician. He found how to retrieve the Duchy of Burgundy from an English Alliance. He was also one of the founders of the treaty of Arras, which reconciled France and Burgundy, putting an end to the Hundred Years War."
