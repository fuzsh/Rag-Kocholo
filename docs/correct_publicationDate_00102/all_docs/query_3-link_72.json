        "text": "A satirical take on classical Arthurian stories, Mark Twain imagines what would happen if a 19th century mechanic traveled back in time to Camelot in the year 528. The Yankee uses his understanding of 19th century science and technology to pose as a magician similar to Merlin. This future knowledge includes gunpowder, electricity, bicycles, and telephones. The main character is critical of the religion, superstitions, and chivalry of Arthurian England, which Twain intended to be an allegory for Gilded Age American society."
