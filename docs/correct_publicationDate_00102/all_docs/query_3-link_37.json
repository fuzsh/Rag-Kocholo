        "text": "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:\n\nNew introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars\n\nBiographies of the authors\n\nChronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events\n\nFootnotes and endnotes\n\nSelective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work\n\nComments by other famous authors\n\nStudy questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations\n\nBibliographies for further reading\n\nIndices & Glossaries, when appropriate\n\nAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influencesbiographical, historical, and literaryto enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. One of the greatest satires in American literature, Mark Twains A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court begins when Hank Morgan, a skilled mechanic in a nineteenth-century New England arms factory, is struck on the head during a quarrel and awakens to find himself among the knights and magicians of King Arthurs Camelot.\n\nWhat follows is a culture clash of the first magnitude, as practical-minded Hank, disgusted with the ignorance and superstition of the people, decides to enlighten them with education and technology. Through a series of wonderfully imaginative adventures, Twain celebrates American homespun ingenuity and democracy as compared to the backward ineptitude of a chivalric monarchy. At the same time, however, Twain raises the question of whether material progress necessarily creates a better society. As Hank becomes more powerful and self-righteous, he also becomes more ruthless, more autocratic, and less able to control events, until the only way out is a massively destructive war.\n\nWhile the dark pessimism that would fully blossom in Twains later works can be discerned in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court, the novel will nevertheless be remembered primarily for its wild leaps of imagination, brilliant wit, and entertaining storytelling.\n\nWith over 200 of the original illustrations by Dan Beard. Stephen Railton teaches American literature at the University of Virginia. His most recent book is Mark Twain: A Short Introduction.\n\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.
