        "text": "Mark Twain combines two distinct time periods in his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. Born in the 19th century, character Hank Morgan wakes up one day to find himself in the 6th century. Morgan quickly takes advantage of his newfound place in a primeval society and establishes power through the introduction of technology. Some critics believe that Morgan’s desire for power leads to his corruption. Two notable critics, Arthur Shattuck O’Keefe and Jane Gardiner, bash Morgan and see through his lies and make-believe, asserting how the Yankee ruined his own vision of bringing the 19th century to the 6th century. As a whole, Morgan’s arrogance and hypocrisy leads to both the growth and eventual collapse of his ideal, utopian society. Hank Morgan represents a corrupt individual who represses opposing ideologies that go against his plans for rebuilding society. He shows determination to get what he wants as he makes change in King Arthur’s domain, not letting any opponent stand in his way. Arthur Shattuck O’Keefe takes a close look at Morgan’s persistence, causing him to believe that it drives the Yankee to the point of complete arrogance and desire for absolute rule. O’Keefe addresses Morgan’s shift of power in his work, The Morally Imperative Lie in Twain's Connecticut Yankee, stating that “Hank Morgan is a malignant (if not totalitarian) authority figure” (O'Keefe). It can be deduced that Morgan uses his power to the highest extent and shows no sympathy as he passes through the various ranks in King Arthur’s court. There is even a point where Morgan passes the King, as in the book it was mentioned how “[He] was no shadow the king… The king himself was the shadow” (Twain 44). It was at this point where “The Boss” assumes the highest political power. However, he furthermore looked to make changes with his newfound role. He later plans possible intrusions with the Church, the most powerful force at the time. He mentions how people in society “see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic Church” (Twain 46). It is at this point where Morgan is just one step away from holding complete dominance. His arrogance blocks out any outside noise, however, as he was told on numerous occasions to be"
