        "text": "A Connecticut Yankee is Mark Twain’s most ambitious work, a tour de force with a science-fiction plot told in the racy slang of a Hartford workingman, sparkling with literary hijinks as well as social and political satire.

Emerging as \"The Boss,\" he embarks on an ambitious plan to modernize Camelot—with unexpected results.\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\nFOREWORD\n\nA CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT\n\nPreface\n\nA Word of Explanation\n\n1.
