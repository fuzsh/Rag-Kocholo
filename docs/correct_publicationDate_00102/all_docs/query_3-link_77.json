        "text": "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court\n\nMark Twain, read by William Dufris, Tantor Media, unabridged, 10 CDs, 12 hrs., $34.99 ISBN 978-1-4001-1607-2\n\nWhen Hank Morgan is transported from 19th-century Hartford, Conn., to sixth-century England, his misadventures begin as he navigates a host of dangers en route to becoming “The Boss” of Camelot. William Dufris’s enthusiastic narration is perfect; the deep drawl he produces might very well be the voice of Twain himself, and his pacing and comedic timing will delight listeners. Dufris is clearly enjoying himself, and he produces a series of unique voices for the knights and damsels Morgan meets in Camelot.
