        "text": "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a novel written by Mark Twain and first published in 1889.\n\nHank Morgan is a Connecticut weapons engineer who, after receiving a blow to the head, is inexplicably transported to 6th century England during the reign of the legendary King Arthur.\n\nThanks to his technological know-how, Hank quickly thrives in a society dominated by chivalry, magic, and rigid social structures. He even becomes the king's chief minister.\n\nWith ingenuity and knowledge, he introduces innovations such as the printing press and gunpowder to the kingdom in an effort to modernize society. Despite his well-intentioned efforts, however, he encounters strong cultural and social opposition.\n\nIn this work, Twain offers a reflection on human nature, social progress, or power, while satirizing the society of his time, characterized by the technological optimism and cultural imperialism of the late nineteenth century.\n\n\"“Camelot—Camelot,” said I to myself. \"I don’t seem to remember hearing of it before. Name of the asylum, likely.” It was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream, and as lonesome as Sunday. The air was full of the smell of flowers, and the buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds, and there were no people, no wagons, there was no stir of life, nothing going on.\""
