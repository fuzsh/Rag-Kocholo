Ryan Phillippe, who recently ended his four-year relationship with Australian actress Abbie Cornish, insists he is still “great friends” with former spouse Reese Witherspoon and took up her offer of a shoulder to cry on following his split. Ryan - who has daughter Ava, 10, and six-year-old son Deacon with Reese - also revealed he called to make sure she was OK following her split from Jake Gyllenhaal in December.

He said: "It's gotten to a place where we're great friends and great co-parents., and also helped her after she ended her romance with. After I had my break-up, she called, and after she did, I called." Despite their closeness, Ryan insists he has never been intimate with Reese since they split in 2006 after seven years of marriage. He said: “That’s never happened.” Reese is now dating Hollywood agent Jim Toth and Ryan has given their romance his blessing.

He told Sirius XM DJ Howard Stern: "I trust her to make the right decisions around our children. I hope she feels the same way." Despite the recent relationship changes in their parents’ lives, the Cruel Intentions star insists his children are unaffected by his romantic choices. He added: "If the kids care about mum and dad, and if that's consistent and they feel protected that way, they don't really care so much about who the parent is dating. They just don't." Ryan also quashed speculation Abbie had dumped him, insisting the decision was mutual and he is tired of being “s**t on” when his relationships end.

He added: "I've been dumped on in the press for relationship stuff since Reese and I divorced. I'm tired of getting s**t on. I don't feel like I deserve it. Things happen!"
