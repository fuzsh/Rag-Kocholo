Aussie actress Abbie Cornish dumped Ryan Phillippe over the weekend amid rumors of his wandering eye and late-night partying. A rep for Cornish confirmed the split to the Melbourne Herald Sun, which also reported Cornish, 27, was spotted moving her stuff out of the LA house she shared with Phillippe, 35. They met on the set of “Stop-Loss” in 2006 when Phillippe was still married to Reese Witherspoon. Weeks later, he left the mother of his two kids after seven years of marriage. Phillippe was at Kenmare last week flirting with a string of Cornish look-alikes.
