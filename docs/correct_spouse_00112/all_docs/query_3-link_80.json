        "text": "She wouldn’t change a thing! Reese Witherspoon recently got candid about her marriage to ex-husband Ryan Phillippe. The exes share daughter Ava, 18, and son Deacon, 13, and even though Reese is currently happily married to Jim Toth — who she shares Tennesse, 5, with — she still reflects on her first marriage. In fact, she draws similarities between her new movie, Home Again, which tells the story of a middle-aged woman dating a younger man, to her own life.\n\n“I got married when I was 23 and I had two kids by the time I was 27,” she told ITV’s Lorraine show while promoting her new film. “I don’t know, sometimes it’s good to know yourself [first].” But, when it comes to regretting her decisions, she explained that she doesn’t regret anything. She added that she “would never change anything” about her life.\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nHome Again follows a newly single woman who strikes up a steamy fling with a 26-year-old boy-toy. “It’s about that next chapter in your life. What do you do when you get to 40 and you’ve made a decision when you were 25 to get married and have kids?” the Legally Blonde beauty continued.\n\nWe’re sure that’s something she can relate to since she had two of her children so young (something she admittedly wouldn’t advise to her daughter). “I’ve said to my daughter, I think you know, at 25, you start to know yourself a little bit better,” she added."
