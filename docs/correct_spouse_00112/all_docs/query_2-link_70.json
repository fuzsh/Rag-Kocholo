        "text": "Abbie Cornish revealed she had a difficult time starting her relationship with Ryan Phillippe.\n\nThe 27-year-old actress, who began dating the screen hunk after meeting him on the set of 2006 movie Stop Loss, prompting speculation she played a part in the breakdown of Phillippe's marriage to Reese Witherspoon, was unprepared for the intense scrutiny their romance attracted.\n\n\"It was a really difficult time for me,\" she said.\n\n\"I was thrust into this realm of paparazzi and coverage that I'd never been exposed to.\n\n\"In a normal successful career, someone usually learns these things bit by bit. For me, it was like night and day. I woke up one day and there was this whole new thing I had to process and deal with.\"\n\nCornish and 34-year-old Phillippe, who has two children, Ava, nine, and five-year-old Deacon, with ex-wife Reese, now live together in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Australian star moved to the US city solely for her relationship, but insists it was the right decision.\n\n\"It was love that brought me here, not work. I think the city feels and looks a little bit different because of that,\" she told W magazine."
