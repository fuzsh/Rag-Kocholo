        "text": "Abbie Cornish talks about being blamed for Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon's marriage break-up\n\nActress Abbie Cornish, who dates the gorgeous Ryan Phillippe, has spoken out for the first time about being blamed for Phillipe and Reese Witherspoon's split.\n\nThe 27-year-old Australian-born star has been accused of starting a relationship with Ryan while he was still married to Witherspoon, after the pair met on the set of war flick 'Stop-Loss'.\n\nCornish explained:\n\n\"It was a really difficult time for me. In a normal, successful career, someone usually learns these things bit by bit. For me, it was like night and day. I woke up one day and there was this whole new thing I had to process and deal with.\"\n\nBut despite all the negative press she has had to contend with, Abbie has admitted that she's just moved to LA to be closer to Ryan, adding:\n\n\"I guess I was lucky because it was love that brought me here [LA], not work. I think the city feels and looks a little bit different because of that.\"\n\nWitherspoon filed for divorce on November 8 in 2006, citing irreconcilable differences after seven years of marriage with Phillippe. They have two daughters together, Ava, nine, and Deacon, five."
