Tsk Tsk.\n\nHe was the dumpee, not the dumper.\n\nIf it is an engagement ring, she is wearing it on the wrong hand...\n\nIn other countries, you wear the engagment/wedding ring on the right hand.\n\nThis is true, but not where she's from, and not where he's from.\n\nThat looks like a mood ring...\n\nIt's on her right hand.\n\nGood luck with his bi-polar ass sweetheart. Reese is better off. Yea, he didn't cheat.\n\ndowngrade\n\nUH remember the time ryan was all like NO NO ITZ NOT TRUES I DID NOT CHEAT ABBY IS A FRIEND\n\nthis makes it so believable.\n\nHe didn't cheat the same way brad and angelia didn't cheat\n\nYeah Grrr\n\nI don't know why women like reese. Maybe cause she's nonthreatening and ugly. You know if he was married to a hot ass chick like Rihanna, all the ladies would be like \"good, she deserved to get cheated on\"\n\nI don't like either of them. Reese seems like she's a secret bitch and Ryan has always been so punchable.\n\niawtc\n\nI agree that Reese is probably a total bitch, but I respect her for how she lives her life. She's not a publicity whore like most celebrities, and seems to be a decent mother. Though her obviously fake relationship with Gyllenho made me think a little less of her.\n\nreese is a secret bitch and rihanna is a not-so-secret bitch.\n\nit's all-around lose.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - double_flusher Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - binary_solo Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - binary_solo Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - binary_solo Expand\n\nI don't like Reese. That is, I think that underneath that \"America's Sweetheart\" attitude she's just secretly a cunning bitch. =)\n\nAnd my feelings towards Ryan are pretty much.... non-existing. Lol.\n\n\"hot chick\" is a very subjective label. personally, i think rihanna is a boring 19 year old whose fashion sense was totally manufactured by some hollywood stylist. also, sometimes hotness comes from life experience and accomplishment if i had to be stuck in an airport lounge with either resse witherspoon or rihanna and forced to make conversation i would definitely pick reese witherspoon.\n\nI agree with everything except the use of the word rihanna, cause girlfriend is busted. but ya, it's the jennifer aniston syndrome totally.\n\nFail.\n\nI have no particular like or dislike for Reese, and it's a fucked-up thing when anyone gets cheated on, especially if there's a marriage and kids involved. He had a family and his dumb skank ass went and fucked it up. I couldn't really condone that behavior no matter who's getting cheated on.\n\nI completely agree with everything you said. Everyone jizzes themselves about Reese, but I cannot stand her. I never could. I don't think she's that pretty and definitley not as talented as she's made out to be.\n\n(no subject) - nicolaroberts Expand\n\n(no subject) - baglady25 Expand\n\n(no subject) - nicolaroberts Expand\n\n(no subject) - baglady25 Expand\n\n(no subject) - nicolaroberts Expand\n\n(no subject) - stellaire Expand\n\n(no subject) - baglady25 Expand\n\n(no subject) - geminibear Expand\n\n(no subject) - suckyfucky Expand\n\n(no subject) - geminibear Expand\n\n(no subject) - suckyfucky Expand\n\n(no subject) - geminibear Expand\n\nI find Reese to be very beautiful. I feel like when she genuinely smiles she glows and I feel like her features are classic and gorgeous.\n\nRhianna is pretty but I don't think she's HOTTTT. Neither of them deserve to be cheated on.\n\nI agree with Reese being nonthreatening and ugly.\n\nwow rihanna is ugly compared to reese, are you kidding me?\n\nI don't think she's ugly at all. For some odd reason I value an intelligent woman more than a \"hot chick\". I don't know, Im just weird like that. :)\n\nIAWTC X 1000\n\nwomen are jealous bitches. nothing new.\n\nRihanna is about as far from hot as you can get.\n\ni don't like reese. she's overrated, especially lookswise. that demonic face she makes when she smiles freaks me out.\n\nyou are SO RIGHT\n\nI'm more offended by her outfit, quite frankly.\n\nthat's what i was thinking.\n\niawtc\n\nIAWTC\n\nWhy do the hottest guys have to be the biggest douches?\n\nThank god he cares about his children or I might just have let him fade away and not care about his sexy ass.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI'm always touchy-feely with guys and girls, but that's probably because I'm Greek. Hugs, kisses, the works (in a completely innocent way, not sluttily and exactly the same towards men and women). I recently moved to London for a master's and the English people appear horrified by how affectionate I am. As in, I go in to air-kiss a guy on both cheeks and he freaks. Or I rub a girl's back to say hello and she looks at me like I'm molesting her.\n\nI dunno.\n\nlooks like his denial was a load of bull.\n\nthat's on hell of a weird coincidence to be dating the one woman you were rumoured to have had an affair with on set which ended his marriage. obviously there was truth to that.\n\nfor some reason lj notifications wont send to my yahoo email anymore, so i switched them to gmail. but gmail groups them up and its so hard to find ALL the comments that i get. is there any way to make gmail stop doing that filing on top of each other thing, or can i somehow make the notifications work with yahoo again? this really sucks :(\n\nsorry I can't help but I actually really like the grouping thing."
