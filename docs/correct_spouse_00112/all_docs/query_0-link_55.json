        "text": "The actor and law school graduate were engaged last Christmas after five years together.\n\nThe breakup comes as a surprise as Phillippe has often gushed about Slagter in interviews.\n\n“When people see her they have these judgments because she could be a model but she’s about to graduate Stanford Law,” he said earlier this year.\n\n“Also what’s great about it — as you get older certain issues become more important to you. I’m very involved in civil rights issues, and so to be with a woman who could actually make an impact in the legal realm — that’s a beautiful thing.”\n\nThe actor was previously married to Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, with whom he has two children, Ava, 17, and Deacon, 13.\n\nThe actor also has a child with ex-girlfriend Alexis Knapp and was previously in a relationship with Australian actress Abbie Cornish for four years.\n\nFriends had spoken about how Slagter had changed Phillippe for the better, “opening his mind to equality and civil rights, areas he has never really focused on that intently.”\n\nPhillippe has spoken about remaining friends with his former partners, particularly ex-wife Witherspoon, whom he was married to for eight years before the couple split in 2007.\n\nOf their split, he has said: “I think more of the problem was age. When we got together we were so young. I think it can create issues with two people in this industry because there’s so much noise that goes along with it.”"
