        "text": "Ryan Phillippe's ex-wife Reese Witherspoon has been supporting him through his split from Abbie Cornish.\n\nThe 35-year-old actor, who recently ended his four-year relationship with the Australian actress, insists he is still \"great friends\" with his former spouse, and also helped her after she ended her romance with Jake Gyllenhaal in December.\n\nPhillippe, who has daughter Ava, 10, and six-year-old son Deacon with Witherspoon, said: \"It's gotten to a place where we're great friends and great co-parents.\n\n\"After I had my break-up, she called, and after she did, I called.\"\n\nDespite their closeness, Phillippe insists he has never been intimate with Witherspoon since they split in 2006 after seven years of marriage. \"That's never happened,\" he said.\n\nWitherspoon is now dating Hollywood agent Jim Toth and Phillippe has given their romance his blessing. He told Sirius XM DJ Howard Stern: \"I trust her to make the right decisions around our children. I hope she feels the same way.\"\n\nPhillippe also quashed speculation Cornish dumped him, insisting the decision was mutual and he said he was tired of being insulted by the media when his relationships end.\n\n\"I've been dumped on in the press for relationship stuff since Reese and I divorced,\" he said. \"I'm tired of that. I don't feel like I deserve it. Things happen.\""
