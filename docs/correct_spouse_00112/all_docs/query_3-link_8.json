        "text": "Ryan Phillippe is going down memory lane.\n\nThe actor made the rare move of posting a throwback photo with Reese Witherspoon via his Instagram Stories Monday.\n\n“We were hot and drenched in late ’90s angst,” the actor, 49, wrote before tagging his ex-wife in the 2001 snap from the “Legally Blonde” premiere. “(such a cooler time than today).”\n\nThe former couple, who were married from 1999 to 2008, stood with their arms around each other in the shot.\n\nWitherspoon, 48, had a bob at the time and paired a black-and-white striped halter dress with a red lip.\n\nPhillippe, for his part, rocked a similarly striped V-neck — but in blue — and completed his look with Ray-Ban sunglasses and black pants.\n\nHe posted a second shot in the same eyewear and a suit, captioning that social media upload with a rock-on emoji.\n\nThe exes met at Witherspoon’s 21st birthday party in 1997, going on to co-star in “Cruel Intentions” two years later.\n\nDuring their nine-year marriage, the duo welcomed daughter Ava, now 24, and son Deacon, now 20, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.\n\nThe pair have put on a united co-parenting front over the years, most recently reuniting at their youngest child’s album release party in April 2023.\n\nBoth Witherspoon and Phillippe have welcomed other children post-divorce, with the latter sharing daughter Kai, 12, with Alexis Knapp.\n\nAs for the actress, Witherspoon is the mother of 11-year-old son Tennessee with her ex-husband Jim Toth.\n\nThe “Big Little Lies” alum and Toth, 53, tied the knot in 2011 in California and called it quits last year.\n\nWhile the Oscar winner was subsequently linked to newly-single Kevin Costner, her rep clarified exclusively to Page Six that reports of the romance were “false.”"
