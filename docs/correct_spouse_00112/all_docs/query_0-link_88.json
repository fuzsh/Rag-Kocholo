        "text": "Australian actress and wannabe rapper Abbie Cornish currently has no agent talent\n\nFixed it OP\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI've only seen her in Billboards and she's one of the worst actresses I've ever seen receive awards for a role\n\nStars- they're just like us!\n\nI forgot all about her\n\nDespite the fact that she recently won a SAG award for her appearance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nStill so ridiculous - both that she won and that the film won. The scene where she confronts whatsherface, she had like 9 different accents in that scene alone, lmao.\n\nI like her as an actress but I was baffled both by her role and by her accent during that entire movie.\n\nI thought she was supposed to be Irish at one point. It was so weird.\n\nHer accent was hysterical. It was like someone faking an English accent for an Ivory Merchant production. She's have fit right in on the set of Bram Stoker's Dracula.\n\nI had completely forgotten she was even in the film. But then I have face blindness when it comes to her\n\nia three billboards the movie and the awards sweep is like a facet of this weird post trump world... how did it happen... why.. is that just how it is now.. the fuck...\n\nI was so confused by why this pretty lady with a foreign accent would be living in this shitty small town.\n\nthe accent was SO FUCKING BAD omg i can't believe nobody stopped her or caught on like wtf\n\nThis and her character tbqh wasn't important. Like she's Woody Harrelson's 30 years younger fucktoy wife whose absence from the movie wouldn't be felt. She had like one semi-important scene where she had to act. Not entirely her fault, but I'm just stunned that she would even be nominated.\n\n(no subject) - alienjiive\n\nCONGRATS!!!\n\nCongrats that’s exactly the type of boring ass yet secure job I need right now. I been looking for something like this in NYC.\n\nWorking for the state in NYC is the absolute worst and it takes forever and ever.\n\n(no subject) - blacktinbox Expand\n\ncongrats!!\n\nSLAY!!!!!\n\nlmao\n\nCongrats sis!!\n\nSuper late but congrats! I also put my two weeks notice today and it was awesome because I'm kind of in love with my (future) new job haha\n\nCongrats!\n\ni totally believe the \"reese blacklisted her\" rumors\n\n(no subject) - alienjiive Expand\n\nLmao\n\nlmao. ilu.\n\nSame!\n\nAfter Bright Star her career dried up like the Sahara desert.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - innocentanalyst Expand\n\n(no subject) - zoaster_toaster Expand\n\n(no subject) - purrple_rain Expand\n\nmte, I wouldn't mess with Reese if you want a career.\n\nPeople forget she’s a bitch in over priced basic ass clothing (Draper James), bc she’s become such a feminist role model for Hollywood and has been so vocal about it. I respect it but I also acknowledge she may still have shady motives.\n\ntbh im a petty bitch, so id blacklist my ex's sidebitch too\n\n(no subject) - __onthebound Expand\n\nsame. not surprised she's that type of feminist\n\nI'd do it in her position too tbh, but only if I could try to blacklist the both of them. Takes two to tango and the man is way more culpable imho, so just destroy them both and be done with it.\n\n(no subject) - angriest_girl Expand\n\n(no subject) - alifereset Expand\n\n(no subject) - nomorefrostbite Expand\n\n(no subject) - __onthebound Expand\n\nJesus I can't believe she won a SAG award for Three Billboards, she was atrocious. Coattail riding at its finest.\n\nHonestly, she was the worst part of the movie imo\n\nWhich was hard to do since there was no best part.\n\n(no subject) - merrymelody Expand\n\nrelatable!\n\nMy career is going horribly. I’ve been at the same company for 5 years, have been promoted several times during that period,and as a manager still get paid and treated like shit and I have applied to so many other places for Administrative Assistant positions and have heard back from NO ONE. 😩 I don’t have a bachelors and I’m scared that’s what’s holding me back fromlanding anything so I’m looking into online classes since I have ZERO time to attend classes due to my shit job. /sorryforventing\n\n(no subject) - alienjiive Expand\n\nTHanks!! I should have gotten it years ago but I was/am my own worst enemy. Hopefully I get the ball rolling soon and i can at least tell potential new employers I’m in the process of earning it! 🤞🏻\n\nDon’t be so hard on yourself. Having a degree should not hold you back. The plus in not having a degree is that companies who want to hired experienced people but not pay them an outrageous salary will gravitate towards someone who doesn’t have a degree. So in some cases, it may work in your favor.\n\nDo you have someone that can review your resume and give you some positive feedback or tips? If you’re putting your Rez out there and no one is biting, you may need to change it up and see if that gets you some calls.\n\n(no subject) - crash31 Expand\n\nI feel you. I have two degrees and I applied for jobs for almost 3 years with only a handful of interviews. I only just got a new job.\n\nIt is tough out there :(. Good luck, hope you find something and a job where you are treated better. Somebody will realise how awesome you are and give you an interview/a chance.\n\nFingers crossed for you.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - crash31 Expand\n\nthese bullet points... it's like i got more annoyed as i read on. what kind of hollywood white privilege nonsense is this. she's also such a forgettable actress (except in 3 billboards where she was just flat out terrible)\n\nWhat the fuck\n\nEdited at 2018-04-13 09:17 pm (UTC)\n\nDa fuck did I listen to?\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nLol mte\n\nThe Gretchen Mol of the mid-aughts. IDK there have always been those next-big-things that never were. As long as she's still working, good on her.\n\nMy goodness, whatever happened to Gretchen Mol?\n\nAllegedly, Harvey Weinstein happened.\n\nGoogle and you'll find out. It was a big story recently during the #metoo era when she spoke out about how people had this idea that she slept with weinstein for roles, when actually she refused to and then he basically killed her career.\n\nHarvey Weinstein essentially blacklisted her and spread rumors about her that she fucked for roles.\n\nlmaooooo. she is terrible at acting. find another career sis.\n\nIdk why but I used to get her and Amber Heard mixed up.\n\n(no subject) - alienjiive Expand\n\nIdk she was good in Bright Star. Not as great as her costar who has gone on to have a great career in the UK tho. But I'm on the opposite side of the fence- I've seen her in that but I've never actually seen an Amber Heard movie\n\n(no subject) - rivains Expand\n\nMy career is.. I'm taking a break after closing my shop because it wasn't the right partnership. I'm glad we decided to end it before investing more money and time. Our friendship is probably over too but after me giving thanks for the time and what we did accomplish in the short time and getting no message, I'm letting all that stay in the past. I'm taking with me that I can do it again and it'll succeed.\n\n(no subject) - alienjiive Expand\n\nThank you, it was rough but I'm glad I have the support and that I didn't stick for something it wasn't going to get better and I learned I can do it on my own\n\nThis is exactly the mature, adult, and just overall impressive things i wish i was saying when discribing my career."
