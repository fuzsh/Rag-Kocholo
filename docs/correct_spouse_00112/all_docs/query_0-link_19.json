        "text": "Australian actress Abbie Cornish may be happily involved with boyfriend Ryan Phillippe, but she isn't sure the couple is heading for a walk down the aisle.\n\nShe told W magazine's September 2009 issue that the two, who met on the set of 2008 \"Stop-Loss\" while Phillippe was still married to Reese Witherspoon, are not engaged at the moment.\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Abbie Cornish\n\nWhen asked if the couple plans to eventually head that way, Cornish replied, \"I don't know.\"\n\nThe actress is currently gearing up for the release of her next film, Jane Campion's \"Bright Star,\" and while she has received praise for roles opposite stars including Russell Crowe (in 2006's \"A Good Year\"), publicly, she's gotten more attention for her relationship with Ryan. In fact, when she was accused in the media of breaking up his marriage, the headlines that went with it were hard to handle.\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Ryan Phillippe\n\n\"It was a really difficult time for me,\" Cornish told the mag. \"It was just this world of tabloid magazines that I'd never been exposed to. In a normal successful career, someone usually learns these things bit by bit. For me, it was like night and day. I woke up one day and there was this whole new thing I had to process and deal with.\"\n\nNowadays the tabloids are less focused on the actress, and she can concentrate on enjoying work and her life in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I guess I was lucky because it was love that brought me here, not work,\" she said of her adopted town. \"I think the city feels and looks a little bit different because of that.\"\n\nRelated Content from AccessHollywood.com:\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Reese Witherspoon & Ryan Phillippe\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Ryan Phillippe: 'Breach' Junket\n\nPLAY IT NOW: PREVIEW: 'Candy'\n\nMORE ACCESS ON THESE TOPICS: Ryan Phillippe - Abbie Cornish - Reese Witherspoon - Celebrities - Australian"
