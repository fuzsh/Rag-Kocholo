        "text": "ACTOR Ryan Phillippe has shared a major throwback photo with his ex-wife Reese Witherspoon.\n\nThe two got married in 1999 and then called it quits in 2008.\n\nOn Monday, Ryan, 49, shared the snap of the couple attending the Legally Blonde premiere in 2001 on his Instagram.\n\nIn the photo, Reese, 48, and her ex-husband posed for photographers while wearing their early 2000s best.\n\nThe I Know What You Did Last Summer actor had his hair styled in a mohawk while ditching the sleeves in a blue and white striped collared shirt and black pants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Big Little Lies actress also went with a striped look, wearing a black-and-white halter dress with red buttons on top.\n\nReese rocked a short blonde bob while attending her movie premiere.\n\n\"We were hot and drenched in late 90s angst,\" Ryan captioned the photo and tagged Reese's social media handle, \"Such a cooler time than today.\"\n\nTHEIR RELATIONSHIP\n\nRyan and Reese met at her 21st birthday party in 1997, just before the two started working on the 1999 blockbuster film Cruel Intentions alongside Selma Blair and Sarah Michelle Gellar.\n\nThey got engaged in 1998, roughly one year after meeting, and by June of 1999 they were married.\n\nTheir wedding took place just a few weeks after Cruel Intentions was released in theaters.\n\nThey tied the knot in Charleston, South Carolina, at Old Wide Awake Plantation.\n\nReese was pregnant with their eldest daughter, Ava, at the time.\n\nThe couple welcomed their daughter in September 1999.\n\nThroughout their relationship, Ryan and Reese faced their challenges and were relatively open with fans about them.\n\nIn August 2002, Ryan revealed in an interview with the New York Daily News that he and his then-wife were putting work on hold to focus on their marriage.\n\nHe shared with the newspaper at the time that they were in couple's therapy.\n\nThe biggest mistake is not doing that, ignoring it and having the marriage fall apart because of laziness\n\nRyan Phillippe\n\nAround the same time, Reese told People magazine: \"I'm not interested in the fallacy of the Hollywood relationship: 'We have perfect children who never cry; we never have problems; we never argue, we're always best friends.' That's just not true. We're normal people with normal problems.\"\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child – a baby boy called Deacon – in October 2003.\n\nThree years later, in October 2006, Reese and Ryan announced plans to separate.\n\nThey said in a joint statement: \"We are saddened to announce that Reese and Ryan have decided to formally separate. They remain committed to their family and we ask that you please respect their privacy and the safety of their children at this time.\"\n\nRyan would later tell W Magazine that the divorce was \"the darkest, saddest place I've ever been.\"\n\nMOVING ON\n\nFollowing their split, both Ryan and Reese moved on.\n\nThe Your Place or Mine star began dating Jim Toth in 2010 and got engaged shortly after.\n\nThey married in 2011 and welcomed their first child, a boy named Tennessee, the following year.\n\nReese detailed their first meeting in a 2012 interview with Elle.\n\nShe recalled: \"This really drunk guy was hitting on me, making such an idiot of himself, yelling at me. He was like, [slurring, scowling, pointing finger in her face] 'You don't know me.' And I was like, 'Yeah, I know. I don't know you!'\"\n\nThe talent-agent stepped in to help the Oscar-winning star get away from the man in question, which sparked up their romance.\n\n\"Jim came over and said, Please excuse my friend. He's just broken up with someone.' Jim was a really good friend, pulling him out of that situation.'\n\n\"That's just kind of who he is, a really good person.\"\n\nReese and Jim announced that they were divorcing in March 2023.\n\n\"We have some personal news to share... It is with a great deal of care and consideration that we have made the difficult decision to divorce,\" they revealed in a statement.\n\n\"We have enjoyed so many wonderful years together and are moving forward with deep love, kindness and mutual respect for everything we have created together.\"\n\nAs for Ryan, he has been romantically linked to several women since he and Reese ended their marriage.\n\nHe has not, however, remarried.\n\nThe actor famously dated Abbie Cornish, Alexis Knapp, Amanda Seyfried, Demi Lovato and Paulina Slagter.\n\nRyan and Alexis share a child together, whom they welcomed in July 2022, according to People.\n\nIn 2017, the Big Sky alum was briefly linked to Elsie Hewitt.\n\nAfter their breakup, the Playboy model filed a $1million lawsuit against Ryan claiming he was physically abusive toward her.\n\nHe denied those allegations.\n\nRyan's rep released a statement to Us Weekly saying he was \"completely devastated that the false allegations have been made and circulated.\"\n\nThe statement went on: \"Domestic violence is an incredibly serious issue and fabricated and proven false claims should not be used to unjustly slander the falsely accused. The claims are false.\"\n\nRyan and Elsie settled outside of court in October 2019."
