        "text": "When a rep for actress Abbie Cornish told UsMagazine.com in February that she had broken up with Ryan Phillippe, at least one person was surprised: Ryan Phillippe.\n\nâI have a new rule: not to date anyone who has a publicist,â Phillippe quipped during a Monday radio interview on Howard Sternâs Sirius XM radio sho.\n\nThe actor explained that he and Cornish had privately ended their four-year romance face-to-face â but no one had warned him of an impending public statement claiming Cornish had dumped him.\n\nâWho announces a breakup? I donât understand that! Thereâs no need for that.â\n\nPhillippe added, âIâve been dumped on in the press for relationship stuff since Reese [Witherspoon] and I divorced.â Phillippe and Cornish began dating in 2006 â the same year he and Witherspoon split after seven years of marriage.\n\nPHOTOS: Was Reese an âOscar curseâ victim?\n\nâIâm tired of getting s*** on,â Phillippe, 35, told Stern. âI donât feel like I deserve it. Things happen! How many people have you broken up with over your life?â\n\nThe actor and Witherspoon now share joint custody of their daughter Ava, 10, and son Deacon, 6 â and, he said, âitâs gotten to a place where weâre great friends and great co-parents.â Such great friends, in fact, that they console each other after breakups.\n\nâAfter I had my breakup, she called, and after she did, I called.â Witherspoon, 34, called it quits with Jake Gyllenhaal in early December after nearly three years together.\n\nPhillippe didnât have much to say about Witherspoonâs new beau, Jim Toth. âI trust her to make the right decisions around our children,â he said simply âI hope she feels the same way.â\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nHe points out that his kids donât get too invested in their parentsâ dating lives. âIf the kids care about mom dad, and if thatâs consistent and they feel protected that way, they donât they donât really care so much about who the parent is dating. They just donât.â\n\nTo Howard Sternâs chagrin, Phillippe also reveals that he and his ex-wife have not had âex sex.â âThat hasnât happened,â he told the shock jock.\n\nSince the Cornish split, he said heâs âenjoying the single-ishâ life, although he calls himself a âserial monogamist..Either a girl is worth spending all of my time with or none of my time.â He shoots down rumors that heâs hooked up with Victoriaâs Secret model Selita Ebanks, Lindsay Lohan or Jessica Simpson. âIâve never met Jessica Simpson!â\n\nncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmymZ5ivam1y6WgqaiVYrauedOiqZ6cXaSzbrPErauippdiwG67zWamr52iYr%2BmsdKeZKyonJ7Bbn6PamdqamQ%3D"
