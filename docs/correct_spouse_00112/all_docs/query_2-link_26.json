        "text": "Actress Abbie Cornish has denied having an affair with Ryan Phillippe.\n\nIt was reported that the 24-year-old Australian beauty had been romancing\n\nthe actor – who split from Reese last month – after meeting him on the Texas\n\nset of their independent film 'Stop Loss'.\n\nAbbie has now vehemently denied the allegations, insisting the pair were\n\nnothing more than “good friends”.\n\nShe told America’s Star magazine: \"We were very good friends and we did\n\nspend a lot of time together, yeah. But we're friends and that's it.”\n\nIt was alleged that Abbie and Ryan were quite blatant about their\n\nrelationship in front of the cast and crew, despite the fact that the\n\n32-year-old actor was married.\n\nA source previously said: \"Ryan did not go out of his way to hide the fact\n\nthat he was having a fling with Abbie. Besides the fact they were spotted\n\nmaking out in a sushi restaurant together, she was spotted many times\n\nleaving his loft apartment.\"\n\nReese, 30, was said to have found out about her husband’s alleged infidelity\n\nafter reading a racy message on his BlackBerry handheld computer-and-phone.\n\nThe ‘Walk The Line’ actress recently filed for divorce from Ryan citing\n\n“irreconcilable differences” and asking for joint custody of the couple's\n\nchildren - seven-year-old Ava and three-year-old Deacon."
