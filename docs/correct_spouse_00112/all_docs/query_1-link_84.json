        "text": "Ryan Phillippe has revealed he finds it \"bizarre\" to see photos of his ex-wife Reese Witherspoon with new love Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n\"It's bizarre,\" the actor told USA Today in a new interview.\n\n\"There's plenty of times when I say, 'What a strange situation I've found myself in.' But at a certain point you know it's going to happen, so you are prepared in some fashion.\"\n\nLast week, Phillippe gave Witherspoon and boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal his blessing.\n\n\"He's a good dude. I love her and I want her to be happy, and it seems like she is.\"\n\nBesides, Phillippe is firmly focused on the future and says he won't rule out getting married again or having more children.\n\nThe Stop Loss actor - who has two children, eight-year-old Ava and four-year-old Deacon, with ex-wife Witherspoon - would love to remarry and have more kids.\n\nPhillippe - who is rumoured to be dating his Stop Loss co-star Abbie Cornish - said: \"I can see getting married again. And I can certainly see possibly having children again. I'm pretty young, and there are many beautiful things about that idea of marriage and family.\n\n\"It just doesn't always work out perfect for everybody. But I've done all I'm going to do in terms of talking about that part. It's fair to her and fair to myself to move on.\n\n\"At this point in time I feel in a pretty good place.\"\n\nWhen asked about his romance with Cornish, the 33-year-old actor remained coy but revealed he loved working with her on the war drama.\n\nPhillippe added to USA Today: \"There's no good to come of making any definitive statement about your personal life in that regard. It's just something I would really rather not address. It has to be a 'no comment'.\n\n\"She is a cool chick. She grew up on a farm. She's kind of a tomboy, so she was like one of the guys a lot of the time.\"\n\n- BANG! SHOWBIZ"
