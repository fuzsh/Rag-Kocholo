She was also married to Ryan Phillippe.\n\nThe former couple divorced in 2007 (shortly after her Oscar-winning role in Walk the Line), but before that they lived in an 8,772-square-foot abode in Bel Air, and that house is now up for grabs.\n\nThe Gerald Colcord-designed home, with oak plank floors throughout, was built in 1969, according to the listing shared by Partners Trust brokers Rick Ojeda and Tim Mullin of Partners Trust.\n\nThe four-bedroom, five-bathroom home is currently on the market for a hefty $16 million, so perhaps there have been some major renovations since Witherspoon and Phillippe occupied the home—they actually sold the house for $4.5 million in 2004, a few years before they announced their separation.\n\nThe great room has a pitched ceiling, brick fireplace and built-in seating, and there’s also a media room and an eat-in kitchen. The master suite occupies a full wing of the home, with its own private sitting room and personal wet bar. There is a full guest house elsewhere on the 0.91-acre estate, in addition to an outdoor barbecue, terrace, pool and spa.\n\nPerhaps the sellers are hoping the home’s former celeb residents will help rope in a buyer willing to dole out the full price—apparently, the home last sold in 2015 for $6.5 million."
