Looks like the native Aussie might be heading back to her roots!\n\n\"She is seriously considering moving back to Australia before the summer. She moved here for Ryan, and now doesn't really think she could stay in L.A. without him,\" Abbie's friend dishes to OK!. \"She still hasn't grown comfortable with living here and is just much more comfortable with family back in Australia. Her mother really wants her to come home.\""
