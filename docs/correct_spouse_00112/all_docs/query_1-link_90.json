        "text": "Ryan Phillippe reveals that him and ex-wife Reese Witherspoon consoled each other following recent splits\n\nYou don't get many ex-partners as civilised as this. Ryan Phillippe announced on air that him and his former wife Reese Witherspoon are great friends, although don't expect him to be so open about any of his future romances...\n\nIn an interview on Howard Stern's Sirius XM radio show, the actor spoke about his break-up with Abbie Cornish and her decision to make the split public by releasing a statement, stating:\n\n\"I have a new rule: not to date anyone who has a publicist.\n\n\"Who announces a breakup? I don't understand that! There's no need for that.\n\nReferring to the fact that he moved on from Reese so quickly following their 2006 divorce, he added:\n\n\"I've been dumped on in the press for relationship stuff since Reese [Witherspoon] and I divorced.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of getting s*** on. I don't feel like I deserve it. Things happen! How many people have you broken up with over your life?\"\n\nStill, it's all amicable, as he continued:\n\n\"It's gotten to a place where we [him and Reese] are great friends and great co-parents.\n\n\"After I had my breakup, she called, and after she did, I called.\"\n\nAlthough he didn't mentioned her new boyfriend Jim Toth, he did reveal:\n\n\"I trust her to make the right decisions around our children. I hope she feels the same way.\"\n\nAw, too bad they've not done a Sienna and Jude and got back together.\n\nSee more celebs who have recently split"
