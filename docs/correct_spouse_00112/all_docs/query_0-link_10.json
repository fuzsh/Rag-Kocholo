        "text": "Abbie Cornish has broken her silence over her controversial relationship with the Hollywood actor Ryan Phillippe.\n\nThe Hunter Valley actress told US magazine In Touch that Ryan is \"a gorgeous guy\". The couple met on the set of the film Stop-Loss in 2006, while Phillippe was married to Reese Witherspoon, who he left later that year.\n\nAt the time of their split, Phillippe's relationship with Cornish was blamed for the marriage breakdown. The actor has since denied he had ever been unfaithful to Witherspoon.\n\nCornish told the magazine she planned to spend Thanksgiving with Phillippe and his family and that she and his two children with Witherspoon, nine-year-old Ava and five-year-old Deacon, \"get along really well\".\n\nCornish made her mark in such Australian films as 2004's Somersault - which won her an AFI Award for best actress - and Candy, opposite Heath Ledger. She has been carving out a Hollywood career and will next year appear as the poet Keats's love interest, Fanny Brawn, in the Jane Campion-directed Bright Star."
