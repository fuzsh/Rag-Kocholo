        "text": "2002: Couple’s Counseling\n\nRyan Phillippe told New York’s Daily News that they were attending couples therapy in 2002, soon after welcoming their first child. “The biggest mistake,” he said, “is not doing that, ignoring it and having the marriage fall apart because of laziness.”\n\n2006: Oscars\n\nReese Witherspoon kissed her husband, Ryan Phillippe, after hearing her name as Best Actress in her role in Walk The Line, and she thanked him in her speech. Per American Rhetoric, she said, “I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband and my two children — who should be goin’ to bed. And thank you for loving me so much and supporting me.”\n\n2006: They Announced Their Separation\n\nReese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe announced they were separating on Oct 30, 2006. Via People, they released a joint statement saying, “We are saddened to announce that Reese and Ryan have decided to formally separate. They remain committed to their family and we ask that you please respect their privacy and the safety of their children at this time.”\n\n2006: Cheating Rumors\n\nNow, there were rumors their marriage ended after Reese Witherspoon confronted Ryan Phillippe about being unfaithful after reading text messages between him and Stop Loss co-star Abbie Cornish (whom he dated from 2007 to 2010).\n\n“It was unfair for [Cornish] to be called the names that she was, because it wasn’t about that. I don’t think an outside person can ever cause a divorce. I had difficulties in my relationship, and in my marriage, long before I ever met her,” Phillippe said to W."
