        "text": "W Magazine, which runs the interview, touches on her insecurity and nerves during the interview, where she talks about the tough time she had with the media at the beginning of her relationship with Phillippe.\n\n“It was a really difficult time for me,” admits Cornish, who W says is \"polite and guarded in demeanor but nonetheless exudes a kind of earthy, unkempt sensuality.\"\n\n“It was just this world of tabloid magazines that I’d never been exposed to. In a normal successful career, someone usually learns these things bit by bit. For me, it was like night and day. I woke up one day and there was this whole new thing I had to process and deal with,” she says.\n\nCornish seems aware that she’ll have to “deal with” at least some additional measure of personal scrutiny during this interview, and her body language shows that she doesn’t enjoy the prospect. She untucks her legs from beneath her to place her feet more firmly on the ground and raises a hand to cover a pale mole on her left cheek as if it were a secret part of her.\n\n“Have you spent time with Ryan and Reese’s two kids?”\n\n“Of course, yeah.”\n\nCornish glances to the wicker table beside her, perhaps hoping to find distraction in the plate of berries, glass of rosé and packet of cigarettes there.\n\n“Are you and Ryan engaged?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Do you have plans in that direction?”\n\n“I don’t know,” she says, adding with a tense laugh, “I think I’m nearly ready to go on to another part of the conversation.”"
