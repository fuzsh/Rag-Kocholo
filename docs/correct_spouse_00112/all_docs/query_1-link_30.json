        "text": "Yesterday, CB reported the shocking (not so much) news that Ryan Phillippe and Abbie Cornish had split. The report seemed very reliable – it came from People Magazine, and Abbieâs rep confirmed the split, saying âAbbie ended the relationship with Ryan and she moved out of their home.â Whatâs a little bit funny is that one sentence has set off a pretty interesting and funny bitchiness from Ryan. Ryanâs rep contacted People and had them rewrite and republish (online) a new version of the breakup article with a new quote. Ryanâs rep told People: âRyan ended the relationship and asked her to move out of his house.” Hmâ¦ I love a little he-said/she-said bullsh-t.\n\nObviously, the bulk of the Cornish-Phillippe post-breakup fight wonât be done in the pages of People Magazine, because People isnât going to pick sidesâ¦ yet. OK! Magazine was game, though. They published a âWhat Really Happenedâ account of the split, and included a little dirt that Abbie was concerned that Ryan and Reese might still be hittinâ it! Thatâs good gossip, right?\n\nAs news surfaced this morning that Ryan Phillippe and Abbie Cornish have called it quits, Hollywood has been left asking â who brought about the break-up?\n\nSources close to the couple say both sides are claiming they are responsible for the split. âRyan ended the relationship recently while she was in Australia and asked her to come and remove her items from his residence,â a pal of Ryanâs tells OK!.\n\nâShe was gone for seven months in production and they basically grew apart,â the source adds. âTheyâd broken up a few times prior. There was no cheating or roving eyes.â\n\nOver on Abbieâs side, a friend tells OK! the starlet was concerned over Ryanâs fidelity â especially since his ex-wife Reese Witherspoon recently ended her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nâAbbie has always questioned Ryanâs loyalty. How could she not? When she began dating him he was married, sheâs a smart girl,â dishes the insider. âShe knows men donât change, she hoped he would but she always knew deep down this wasnât forever.â\n\nHowever Ryanâs pal insists that there was no other woman involved â including Ryanâs ex.\n\nâHe will always care about Reese, she is the mother of his kids and his first big love,â claims the source.\n\nDuring the course of Abbie and Ryanâs romance, Abbie became close to his kids with Reese, Ava and Deacon.\n\nâShe is very sad about not seeing the kids regularly,â Abbieâs pal tells OK!. â She loves them, adores them and will miss them terribly.â\n\nNow that Abbie has moved out of Ryanâs home, where will she go next? Looks like the native Aussie might be heading back to her roots!\n\nâShe is seriously considering moving back to Australia before the summer. She moved here for Ryan, and now doesnât really think she could stay in L.A. without him,â Abbieâs friend dishes to OK!. âShe still hasnât grown comfortable with living here and is just much more comfortable with family back in Australia. Her mother really wants her to come home.â\n\n[From OK! Magazine]\n\nSo, they donât come right out and say âAbbie was concerned that Ryan might still be slipping Reese a little something-somethingâ but itâs all in the subtext. However, even though I love a great piece of juicy, dirty gossip, I donât think itâs true. And if itâs true that Abbie had those particular concerns, I think girlfriend needs to wake up. Ryan and Reese are no longer banginâ. Heâs been banginâ other women, but not his ex-wife."
