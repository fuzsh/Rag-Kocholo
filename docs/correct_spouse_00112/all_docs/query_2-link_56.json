        "text": "He supposedly cheated to get her, and now Ryan Phillippe may have cheated and lost her.\n\nAfter a three-year relationship that started when the actor cheated on wife Reese Witherspoon with Abbie Cornish, the latter has finally come to her senses and dumped Phillippe.\n\n“Abbie ended the relationship with Ryan and she moved out of their home,” her rep told People.\n\nThe break-up takes place after months of celebrity gossip rumors made Phillippe sound like the Tiger Woods of acting, minus the talent. He’s been spotted with other women at nightclubs around the globe.\n\nAsked about the cause of the split, Cornish’s rep took the high road and said: “No comment.”\n\nCornish has been in Vancouver for the last seven months shooting a movie whose title could well sum up the demise of her relationship: Sucker Punch.\n\n** UPDATE: A friend of Phillippe’s defends the actor. He told us:\n\n“Ryan ended the relationship recently while she was in Australia and asked her to come and remove her items from his residence… She was gone for seven months in production and they basically grew apart. They’d broken up a few times prior. There was no cheating or roving eyes.”"
