        "text": "Taking a page from Brangelina, recently divorced Ryan Phillippe and Australian actress Abbie Cornish are finally taking their relationship public. Yes, it’s all eerily familiar, considering Ryan’s claims of divorce depression. Not to mention Abbie’s denial that their affair while filming “Stop Loss” ended Ryan’s marriage to Reese Witherspoon.\n\n“Pictures snapped last week at a friend's house in Beverly Hills show the two are definitely joined at the hip,” reports Gatecrasher.\n\nStill, it appears the uncloseted couple isn’t planning on adopting third-world children anytime soon, as they’re busying playing with Ryan and Reese’s kids.\n\nAccording to Gatecrasher, “The toothsome twosome were spotted getting Starbucks coffee together and driving on the Pacific Coast Highway on Friday before Ryan picked up the kids from school. And on Sunday, the four of them went shopping for Christmas decorations.”\n\n“Going out together and leaking a few photos is their discreet way of letting the public know it's official,” a source close to the couple told Gatecrasher. “It's not like you can send out a press release about these things.”\n\nMaybe, but you could ask your friends not to issue passive-aggressive Reese-bashing quotes like this one: “Abbie is a free spirit,” another source allegedly close to the couple told Us Weekly. “She indulges a side of Ryan that he's kept under wraps for years.”\n\nAdvice to Britney from K-Fed’s other ex And now, some sage words for Britney Spears from someone who’s been there – K-Fed’s other baby mama, Shar Jackson. “Take it easy,” Shar recently advised the popwreck via OK! “Enjoy the holidays. Lay low a little bit.”\n\nAnd if “amazing dad” Kevin Federline has the kids, not to worry. “He's very loving and his kids are his No. 1 priority,\" she told the magazine.\n\nWith the wisdom that got her a spot on “The Ex-Wives Club,” Shar claims her credo is motherhood first. “In my extra time, I throw that career thing in. When you're a parent, everything is so funny, so it's just nonstop laughter.\" It’s just that simple!\n\nMel B’s hubby hates her Spice-y performance After her “Dancing With the Stars” defeat, a recent performance with the reunited Spice Girls should have left Melanie Brown feeling like a winner. Not so, according to a report in the Daily Mirror. It’s bad enough if a fan walks out on a show, but on this occasion, Mel’s own hubby, Stephen Belafonte, couldn’t stomach what he saw on stage.\n\nWhile performing Lenny Kravitz’s “Are You Gonna Go My Way,” Scary Spice plucked a gent from the crowd and gave him a sexy, hip shaking almost-lap dance. A spy for the Mirror said, “[Stephen] had a face like thunder and walked out — and didn't return for the rest of the show.”\n\nDish on the fly A crush on Justin Timberlake led to heartbreak, or at least loads of teenage embarrassment, for Mandy Moore. In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel (posted to OK’s Web site), the singer confessed she had a crush on the N’Syncer when she opened for the boy band when she was 15. “I think he was trying to be cute,” Mandy told Jimmy. “He told me, ‘You have big feet for a girl.’” When Jimmy asked if JT realized he crushed her with his comments, Mandy joked, “I don’t think he does!” … Star Magazine reports Jake Gyllenhaal and Tobey Maguire are ready to rumble. Seems the money managers for their upcoming flick, “Brothers,” don’t want to hire separate makeup artists for the actors. “They each want their own retoucher, but the producers don’t think it’s necessary and don’t see why they can’t share,” a source told the publication. “Tobey is holding out for his own person, while Jake said he needs his artist so badly he’ll let her stay with him during the shoot.” … John Mayer was on the prowl Tuesday night when he spotted Ricki Lake at a PR company’s holiday bash. According to Page Six, the singer-songwriter confessed to the former talk host, “I've had a crush on you for two years.” The pair swapped digits, and after Ricki left, John spent the remainder of the evening texting her.
