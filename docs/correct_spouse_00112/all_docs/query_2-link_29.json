        "text": "My 15-year-old self, who fell hopelessly in love with Ryan Phillippe in Cruel Intentions, should be absolutely stoked that he and girlfriend Abbie Cornish ended their relationship. But instead...\n\n...I'm actually pretty sad that these two great actors have called it quits. Us Weekly is reporting that Cornish, who met Phillippe on the set of their film Stop-Loss, was seen moving her stuff out of the Los Angeles home they shared.\n\n\"They had grown apart,\" says a source. \"She flew into town yesterday to move out, as he asked her to do so.\"\n\nAbbie's rep, however, claims that she gave him the boot. And some tabloids have speculated that Ryan was unfaithful. Who knows what happened between these two. Regardless, there are very few ways to heal a relationship when two people are headed in different directions.\n\n\"I went one way—art school—and he went another—the Marines,\" recalls my friend Sophia, who dealt with this issue firsthand. \"We certainly still loved each other; we just weren't in the same place anymore.\"\n\nIt's one of the more frustrating issues that couples encounter. As we get older, we realize that the things we want out of life might not be what our partners want—at least not at the exact same time. What's the solution?\n\nHave you broken up with a boyfriend because you'd grown apart? Do you regret it…or was it the right decision?\n\nFor more on breaking up…\n\n*Vacay fantasy!
