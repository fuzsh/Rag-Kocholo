        "text": "Ryan Phillippe is going down memory lane.\n\nThe US actor made the rare move of posting a throwback photo with Reese Witherspoon via his Instagram Stories Monday.\n\n“We were hot and drenched in late ’90s angst,” the actor, 49, wrote before tagging his ex-wife in the 2001 snap from the Legally Blonde premiere. “(such a cooler time than today),” he added.\n\nThe former couple, who were married from 1999 to 2008, stood with their arms around each other in the shot.\n\nWitherspoon, 48, had a bob at the time and paired a black-and-white striped halter dress with a red lip.\n\nPhillippe, for his part, rocked a similarly striped V-neck — but in blue — and completed his look with Ray-Ban sunglasses and black pants.\n\nHe posted a second shot in the same eyewear and a suit, captioning that social media upload with a rock-on emoji.\n\nThe exes met at Witherspoon’s 21st birthday party in 1997, going on to co-star in Cruel Intentions two years later.\n\nDuring their nine-year marriage, the duo welcomed daughter Ava, now 24, and son Deacon, now 20, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.\n\nHe posted a second shot in the same eyewear and a suit, captioning that social media upload with a rock-on emoji.\n\nThe pair have put on a united co-parenting front over the years, most recently reuniting at their youngest child’s album release party in April 2023.\n\nBoth Witherspoon and Phillippe have welcomed other children post-divorce, with the latter sharing daughter Kai, 12, with Alexis Knapp.\n\nAs for the actress, Witherspoon is the mother of 11-year-old son Tennessee with her ex-husband Jim Toth.\n\nShe and Toth, 53, tied the knot in 2011 in California and called it quits last year.\n\nWhile the Oscar winner was subsequently linked to newly-single Kevin Costner, her rep clarified exclusively to Page Six that reports of the romance were “false.”\n\nAs for Toth, the talent agent appeared to take a romantic Costa Rica holiday with a mystery woman in July 2023."
