And then there's the fact that daughter Ava is now so much of a Reese doppelganger that we're sure she must have a screengrab from Legally Blonde as her Facebook profile picture.\n\nWe know it's hardly a revelation that kids sometimes look a bit like their parents, but the resemblance here is proper freaky - at first glance, we actually thought it was Reese, and were secretly hoping they were back together after all these years.\n\nHonestly, it's almost like Ryan's trying to make everything look super-cute to distract us from the fact that his relationship has gone to shit, isn't it? We just hope he remembers that we're very much available - and great with kids...\n\nPics: Matrix"
