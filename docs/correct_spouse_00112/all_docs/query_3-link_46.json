        "text": "Background\n\nMatthew Ryan Phillippe, famously known as Ryan Phillippe, was born in New Castle, Delaware, to a chemical engineer called Richard, and Susan, his mother who ran a daycare center. Phillippe has three sisters by the names of Katelyn, Kirsten, and Lindsay Phillippe. He was enrolled in a local Baptist Academy and later graduated from New Castle Christian Academy in Wilmington.\n\nHe moved to New York where he signed with Cathy Parker Management. He filmed for “One Life To Live” and later moved to Los Angeles, where he performed in small acting roles such as in “Due South,” “Matlock,” and “Crimson Tide” which was a film released in 1995. After his breakthrough role in “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” he began starring alongside artists like Neve Campbell, Mike Myers, and Selma Hayek. He also co-starred with Benicio del Toro in “The Way of the Gun,” a horror film that received mixed reviews. Phillippe played a role in “The Bang Bang Club,” a real-life story film, as well as produced and narrated the documentary “Isolated” which premiered in 2013.\n\nRelationships have been one of Phillippe’s weaknesses, and some would believe he’s fallen out of luck. Phillippe married Reese Witherspoon in 1999 and later in that same year they birthed Ava Elizabeth Phillippe, their daughter. In 2003, they had their second child, Deacon Reese Phillippe. In 2007, the couple divorced and Phillippe dated Abbie Cornish. In the following years, he dated Alexis Knapp and Paulina Slagter. He even got sued by Elsie Hewitt, his ex-girlfriend."
