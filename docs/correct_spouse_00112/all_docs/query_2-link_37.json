I was thrust into this realm of paparazzi and coverage that I'd never been exposed to.\n\n“In a normal successful career, someone usually learns these things bit by bit. For me, it was like night and day. I woke up one day and there was this whole new thing I had to process and deal with.”\n\nCornish and 34-year-old Phillippe – who has two children, Ava, nine, and five-year-old Deacon, with ex-wife Reese - now live together in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Australian star - who has remained tight-lipped on whether she and Ryan are planning to wed - moved to the US city solely for her relationship, but insists it was the right decision.\n\nShe told W magazine: “It was love that brought me here, not work. I think the city feels and looks a little bit different because of that.”"
