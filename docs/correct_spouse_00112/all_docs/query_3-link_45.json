        "text": "The Cruel intentions co-stars cordially co-parented their kids following their 2008 divorce. But tipsters dished they now rarely speak as their daughter Ava, 23, and son Deacon, 19, are on their own.\n\n\"Reese and Ryan maintained a civil relationship when they were making decisions about their children — but that's gone now,\" an insider squealed.\n\nReese Witherspoon's Daughter Ava Spotted Out With Boyfriend Who Is A Dead Ringer For Her Dad Ryan Phillippe\n\nThe spy added that Reese, 46, is still peeved about being subpoenaed to testify in 2019 when Ryan's ex-girlfriend, model Elsie Hewitt, 26, accused him of battering her and slapped the actor with a $1 million lawsuit.\n\nThe movie hunk, 48, denied abusing Elsie but settled the case out of court.\n\n\"Reese still sees Ryan's life is messy, and she doesn't want to be drawn into it,\" the source said. \"She doesn't care for him — or see the need to be buddies.\"\n\nAs RadarOnline.com reported, Elsie sued Ryan for $1 million in 2017 after accusing him of assaulting her at his Los Angeles home. According to her, the I Know What You Did Last Summer star “braced his body and violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could\" after the two got into a fight. She also provided bruises of her injuries.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Elsie accused the actor of abusing “cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and steroids.” She even added Ryan's ex-wife to her witness list — which didn't sit well with the actor.\n\nRyan desperately tried to keep Reese out of it. He ended up settling with Elsie in 2019, just days before they were set to face off in court. He denied all allegations of assault and accused Elsie of trying to extort him."
