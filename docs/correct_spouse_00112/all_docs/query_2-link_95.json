        "text": "In a recent interview with W magazine, actor and father of two, Ryan Phillippe revealed some personal details of his life following his divorce with Reece Witherspoon and the rumors that he was man-whoring around with Abbie Cornish. According to Phillippe, he was having trouble in the marriage well before he met Cornish and was so saddened by the divorce that he was in bed for 5 months after it happened. Hmmm. We&#146;re wondering if he was rolling solo in that bed.Your take: Do you think Ryan is being sincere about being faithful and truly depressed after the divorce? Or do you think he's a cheater going for the sympathy vote to get back on the public's good side?"
