        "text": "Reese Witherspoon has taken a look back at her marriage to Ryan Phillippe, and admitted she ‘wouldn’t change anything’ about the past.\n\nThe actress, now 41, married Phillippe in 1999 when she was aged 23 and the couple divorced seven years later. She then remarried talent agent Tim Joth in 2011.\n\nSpeaking on Lorraine on Thursday, Reese discussed her former husband, who she has daughter Ava, 18 and son Deacon, 21 and her film career to date.\n\nPromoting her new film Home Again, which centres around a young mother who strikes up a steamy fling with a toyboy, Reese said: ‘It’s about that next chapter in your life.\n\n‘What do you do when you get to 40 and you made a decision when you were 25 to get married and have kids?\n\n‘I got married when I was 23 and had two kids by 27. Sometimes it’s good to know yourself.’\n\nShe then looked back fondly at her marriage to hunk Ryan at the age of 23 and confessed: ‘I would never change anything!’\n\nAlthough she did reveal that she offered her daughter Ava advice to take time before jumping into a commitment too quickly.\n\n‘I said to my daughter, at 25 you start to know yourself better.’\n\nSpeaking further about her new film, Reese revealed: ‘We always see older men with younger women onscreen and I think maybe it’s because people don’t think about it.\n\n‘Society changes if you have different perspectives. And that’s if you hire people of colour and women directors,’ she said.\n\nReps for Reese Witherspoon have been contacted by Metro.co.uk.\n\nMORE : Ryan Phillippe denies abuse allegations as pictures emerge of ex-girlfriend Elsie Hewitt’s bruises"
