        "text": "Ryan Phillippe is set to marry again after popping the question to his longterm girlfriend.\n\nThe 41-year-old actor reportedly proposed to Paulina Slagter over the holidays, according to the New York Post's Page Six column.\n\nThe 'Catch Hell' star - who was married to actress Reese Witherspoon for eight years - recently gushed about his wife-to-be.\n\nHe said: \"It's [serious]. I'm not opposed to [getting married again]. She's awesome.\n\n\"When people see her they have these judgments because she could be a model but she's about to graduate Stanford Law.\n\n\"Also what's great about it - as you get older certain issues become more important to you.\n\n\"I'm very involved in civil rights issues, and so to be with a woman who could actually make an impact in the legal realm - that's a beautiful thing.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nRyan also recently admitted he's more focused on his family, including his three children, daughters Ava, 16, and and Kai, four, and 12-year-old son Deacon, and his career is taking a back seat as a result.\n\nHe shared: \"Since I became a dad, I love the business [but] it's not everything to me. I think that's held me back in some regards.\""
