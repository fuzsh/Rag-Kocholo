        "text": "Phillippe is not the only good actor working in \"Stop Loss.\" Peirce has stocked the film with talent: Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are his army buddies, Abbie Cornish (whom Phillippe met on the set and is now apparently having a child with), and Timothy Olyphant are also featured to great effect.\n\nI wrote, as an aside, that they were apparently having a child together. I thought it was a reiteration of known news. It was certainly not presented as a scoop... Alas, Abbie, whom most people don't know anyway, is not with child... Nevertheless I had to endure the obnoxious bleating of her publicist. I guess the idea is that if you're rude and keep talking over the person you called, the journalist will not write about the client again."
