        "text": "A representative for the Australian actress said: “Abbie ended the relationship with Ryan and she moved out of their home.”\n\nHowever, the rep’ did not give a reason for the separation.\n\nRumours have been rife for some time that Ryan, 35, and 27-year-old Abbie’s relationship was on the rocks.\n\nAt the beginning of the year it was reported the pair were \"fighting all the time\" over the actor’s apparent reluctance to commit.\n\nA source said at the time: \"The main thing is that Abbie wants to be married and start a family and she feels it's beyond time for Ryan to make that happen. Ryan is spending more and more time partying.\"\n\nAbbie and Ryan – who has two children, Ava, ten, and Deacon, six, from his marriage to Reese Witherspoon – first met in 2006 on the set of their film ‘Stop-Loss’ and officially started dating in 2007."
