        "text": "The Aussie actor, 27, and Phillippe, 35, split at the weekend after a very private two-year relationship.\n\nCornish was seen moving her belongings out of their shared Los Angeles home.\n\nTheir last visit to Australia together was for a Calvin Klein 40th anniversary party in Sydney in December 2008.\n\nCornish's representative confirmed the couple had ended their romance, which was recently plagued by whispers of Phillippe's late-night partying and rumoured infidelity.\n\nPhillippe was said to have left his Academy Award-winning wife, actor Reese Witherspoon, with whom he has two young children, for the NSW-born star.\n\nThe Cruel Intentions star was reported to have had secret liaisons with numerous women and to have approached many for their phone numbers.\n\n\"Abbie ended the relationship with Ryan and she moved out of their home,\" her representative said.\n\nPhillippe has declined to comment.\n\nAmong the most publicity-shy of all Hollywood couples, they rarely spoke openly about their romance.\n\nCornish and Phillippe had not been seen in public together for several months.\n\nBut they doused rumours their romance was on the rocks by walking the red carpet hand in hand at an LA fashion event just three weeks ago.\n\nThey looked happy and relaxed as they posed for photographers and mingled with other guests at the Calvin Klein charity benefit on February 1.\n\nCornish met Philippe on the set of their movie Stop Loss in August 2006, but they didn't emerge as a couple until a year later.\n\nWithin weeks of meeting Cornish, Phillippe divorced Witherspoon after seven years of marriage.\n\nSince then Cornish, who was raised on a farm in the Hunter Valley in NSW, has broken through as one of Hollywood's most promising young actors.\n\nCornish has most recently been seen in Jane Campion's film Bright Star, and has graced the cover the latest cover of Vanity Fair magazine."
