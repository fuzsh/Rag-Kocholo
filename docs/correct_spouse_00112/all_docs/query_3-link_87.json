        "text": "Speaking on Lorraine yesterday Reese Witherspoon opened up about her marriage to Ryan Phillippe. The Oscar-winning actress spoke candidly about tying the knot at just 23 and how she felt about their relationship nearly twenty years later.\n\n‘I got married when I was 23 and I had two kids by the time I was 27,’ Witherspoon explained.\n\n‘I don’t know, sometimes it’s good to know yourself [first],’ the Legally Blonde star reflected. However she admitted she had no regrets saying she 'would never change anything' about her life.\n\nWitherspoon met Phillippe on the set of Cruel Intentions and the pair married in 1999 after two years of dating. They had two children - Ava now 18, and Deacon now 13 - before divorcing in 2006. The actress went on to marry talent agent Jim Toth in 2011, and the couple share one child, Tennessee, aged 5.\n\nWATCH NOW: The most stylish celebrity weddings\n\nWhen asked on Lorraine for the advice she would give her 18-year-old daughter about love and marriage, the star said she was keen to encourage her to work on herself first.\n\n'I said to my daughter, at 25 you start to know yourself better,' she admitted.\n\nDuring her discussion on the ITV show, Witherspoon did not directly address the abuse claims that have surfaced about her ex-husband. Last week Phillippe’s ex-girlfriend, Elsie Hewitt, filed a $1 million domestic abuse lawsuit accused the actor acusing him of physically abusing her at their home.\n\nWitherspoon, an outspoken campaigner against domestic violence, was reportedly ‘incredibly disturbed by the details’ of the lawsuit and ‘distressed and upset’ by the situation.\n\nREAD MORE: Reese Witherspoon In Turmoil As Ex Ryan Phillippe Faces Abuse Claims\n\nREAD MORE: Jennifer Aniston And Reese Witherspoon Are Reuniting In New TV Show"
