        "text": "Reese Witherspoon and her ex-husband Ryan Phillippe were both on hand to celebrate their son’s burgeoning music career.\n\nThe “Legally Blonde” actress, who announced her divorce from Jim Toth last month, reunited with her first husband for Deacon’s album release party Friday.\n\nThe “Big Sky” actor shared a series of snaps from the event on Instagram, along with a caption urging fans to stream the new album.\n\n“Awesome night w family & friends celebrating the release of, ‘A New Earth’ by @deaconphillippe,” the proud dad wrote.\n\n“Stream, download, and listen to the album.”\n\nThe photo set included a pic of the father-and-son duo with their arms hooked around each other.\n\nPhillippe, 48, kept it simple in a plain white T-shirt with a red, black and white knit sweater, while his mini-me opted for a black shirt, a white checkered jacket and a multicolored beaded necklace.\n\nDeacon, 19, also posed for a snap with his mom, and 23-year-old sister Ava Phillippe.\n\nThe newly single “Big Little Lies” star stunned in a red plaid jacket with jeans, while her lookalike daughter wore a green crop top with black leather pants and a belt.\n\nWitherspoon, who also shares 10-year-old son Tennessee with estranged husband Jim Toth, took to social media in support of her eldest son.\n\n“Let’s goooo @deaconphillippe,” she captioned a screenshot of Spotify’s “New Pop Picks,” which featured his song, “Virus,” on her Instagram Story.\n\nThe party marked one of the Hello Sunshine founder’s first outings since she filed for divorce from Jim, 52, on April 1 after 12 years of marriage.\n\n“We have some personal news to share. It is with a great deal of care and consideration that we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” Witherspoon wrote on Instagram March 24.\n\n“We have enjoyed so many wonderful years together and are moving forward with deep love, kindness, and mutual respect for everything we have created together,” she continued.\n\nThe “Walk The Line” Oscar winner, who since has deleted the post, called Tennessee their “biggest priority.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“These matters are never easy and are extremely personal,” she concluded. “We truly appreciate everyone’s respect for our family’s privacy at this time.”\n\nWitherspoon and Ryan, who both starred in the iconic ’90s film “Cruel Intentions,” were married from 1999 to 2008 and continue co-parenting their two kids.\n\nThey have reunited throughout the years, including at Deacon’s June 2022 high school graduation.\n\nThe former soap star credited his ex-wife with being “very good about” creating a “healthy” family dynamic.\n\n“You have to get to that point as a divorced parent … where you’re not putting yourself first,” Ryan told “Entertainment Tonight.” in 2016.\n\n“You want the kids’ experience to be its own.”"
