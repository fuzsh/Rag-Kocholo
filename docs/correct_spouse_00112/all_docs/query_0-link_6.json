        "text": "The story goes that Ryan Phillipe's marriage to Reese Witherspoon died along with his career after he started having an affair with his Stop-Loss co-star Abbie Cornish Game Hen back in 2006. So it's really not surprising to read that Abbie has dropped Ryan's dick from her life, because she's sick of dating a dirty filthy sl*t who is trying to dethrone Gerard Butler as the biggest manwhore on the West Coast. Abbie's rep confirmed the split to People:\n\n\"Abbie ended the relationship with Ryan and she moved out of their home.\"\n\nWhen People asked if the break-up had anything to do with the rumors that Ryan has been (see what I did there) cheating on Abbie for the past year, her rep simply farted: \"No comment.\" In bullsh*tanese, \"no comment\" means \"fuc* yes.\"\n\nI know that everyone and their dog is barking, \"What goes around comes around, wh*re,\" but it's hard to see the light when you're getting dicked in a special way. Which I'm assuming is why Abbie's vag stuck around so long, because let's be honest here, a cream-less Twinkie could tickle your brain more than Ryan Phillipe can. Well, unless Ryan does you in the ear.\n\ndlisted\n\nRyan Phillippe Quits Abbie Cornish, Says Rep\n\nRyan Phillippe takes his kids Ava and Deacon to visit a friend’s house on Sunday (February 21) in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nAt the time, his ex-girlfriend Abbie Cornish was moving out of their home.\n\nYesterday, news broke that Ryan and Abbie called it quits. Abbie’s rep claims that Abbie dumped Ryan but now Ryan’s rep has a different story.\n\n“Ryan ended the relationship and asked her to move out of his house,” his rep tells JustJared.com.\n\nAbbie reportedly flew in Saturday (February 20) at Ryan’s request to remove her belongings from his home as they had broken up already while she was in Australia. Ryan was most recently in the Big Apple for NY Fashion Week.\n\nLike in any relationship, there are two sides to every story.\n\nWHOSE SIDE of the story do you believe — Ryan’s or Abbie’s?\n\njustjared.buzznet.com\n\nI saw one of those vanity fair behind the scenes video and she did seem pretty snooty. She was complaining about being uncomfortable and asking them to change songs etc. I think young actresses who get the priviledge to be in vanity fair should keep their mouth shut and be in awe otherwise its just a waste.."
