Ryan Phillippe ended his relationship with Abbie Cornish after the couple grew apart, according to his rep.

The actress' spokesperson stated on Sunday (21Feb10) Cornish had ended their three-year romance shortly after the Australian was spotted moving her belongings out of their shared Los Angeles home.

But a rep for the Cruel Intentions star insists he instigated the break-up, explaining: "Ryan ended the relationship with Abbie while she was in Australia, which was before New York Fashion Week, and asked her to move out of his house, which she did this weekend. She was out of town working for seven months, and they grew apart."

The former couple met on the set of Stop-Loss in 2006 and began dating the following year (07) after Phillippe split from ex-wife Reese Witherspoon.
