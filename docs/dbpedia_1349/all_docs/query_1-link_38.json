Reputation is the celebrity we admire in the mirror. Character is the person who follows us everywhere. Reputation is our public image—what we want others to think. Character is our secret actions, words, and thoughts—what we really are. Mathematically speaking, reputation is character minus the flaws we try to hide. We often mar our character by protecting our reputation, but God builds our character by smashing our reputation. Let’s allow God to transform our character, for when character is developed, reputation takes care of itself.\n\nHave you been slandered? Are you anxious to defend your reputation? Let your character speak about your reputation. “While slander may blacken the reputation, it cannot stain the character. That is in God's keeping” (E.G. White). Stop worrying about your reputation, be more concerned with your character. Character outlasts reputation. (1 Peter 2:12; Proverbs 22:1; Ecclessiastes 7:1)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nAPPOINTMENTS WITH DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nDisappointments are inescapable appointments in life. Why do we have to face them? Often, dashed hopes, shattered dreams, and unmet expectations summon us to change directions so we can get on the right track. Setbacks are also useful for the trial and exercise of our courage and faith in God. Though painful, a blessed disappointment is when God allows our plans to fail, so His plans for us might succeed. Our disappointments are His appointments to transform our bitterest moments into occasions of great significance. Be sure to honor all your appointments with disappointment, for we sometimes have to be disappointed in order to be appointed for our unique purpose. (Jeremiah 29:11; Romans 8:28, 35-39; Hebrews 10:35).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWORRY IS BLIND\n\nWorry is shortsighted and blind, but faith has vision. One unknown source gives a breakdown of what the average person worries about: 40% focus on things that will never happen, 30% deal with the past that can't be changed, 12% concern criticism by others, mostly untrue, 10% relate to health, which worsens with anxiety, and only 8% are about legitimate concerns that require action. Statistics aside, the observation confirms that worry is an exercise in futility. There are two things we should never worry about: (i) things we cannot change and (ii) things we can change. Think about it! Then listen to these wise sayings:\n\n“Worrying is like sitting in a rocking chair. It gives you something to do but it doesn’t get you anywhere” (English proverb). \"Worrying is so dumb. It's like carrying an umbrella waiting for it to rain\" (Unknown). “What worries you masters you” (Haddon W. Robinson). “Worrying is like paying a debt you don’t owe” (Mark Twain). “Worrying does not take away tomorrow’s troubles, it takes away today’s peace” (unknown). “Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble” (Jesus Christ). Then take some time to read and reflect on Christ’s profound words in Matthew 6:25-34.\n\n“Worry is blind.... Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for us, of which we know nothing (E.G. White). “Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7; NLT). So why worry?—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE OPPORTUNITY OF PAIN\n\nWe don’t own our pain. It’s for public service. Whether it’s sorrow, hurt, regret, disappointment, afflictions, persecution, or some other form of suffering, our pain is never an end in itself. It’s an invitation to serve.\n\nLife has no safe harbors against pain. Thus, as long as we live we shall have the privilege of meeting pain—our own share of pain. When encountered, true pain needs no introduction, for it is its own introduction. And when pain greets us with its commanding presence, it also whispers its royal mission: It’s our pain that equips us to empathize with those who go through similar things we’ve experienced. It is what most qualifies us to comfort those who’re hurting. And it’s that which gives us the credibility to speak to a suffering world.\n\nThank God for the pain in your life. Hard as it might be to believe, the more you hurt the nearer God is. Through your pain, He can do far more with you, and bring out of you a far better person than without it. One day you will discover that the most painful thing that ever happened to you was also one of the most useful tools there could ever have been for your refinement. Your pain is your greatest opportunity for service, see it for its purpose and not its ache (2 Corinthians 1:3, 4; cf. Hebrews 2:18).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nEMPATHY, NOT APATHY (Indifference: Evil with An Innocent Face)\n\n“Do not fear your enemies. The worst they can do is kill you. Do not fear friends. At worst, they may betray you. Fear those who do not care; they neither kill nor betray, but betrayal and murder exist because of their silent consent” (Bruno Jasienski). “Those who don’t care” show a lack of interest, concern, or sympathy. Indifference or apathy is a conscious choice to do nothing or say nothing when things are not right. It is a refusal to act in the face of injustice or need.\n\nIndifference is more hurtful than hate; it’s evil with an innocent face. “Indifference is the world’s worst poison” (Kofi Annan, Nobel peace laureate and former UN Secretary General). \"Indifference is the sign of sickness, a sickness of the soul more contagious than any other\" (Elie Wiesel, Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor). Similarly, George Bernard Shaw, a recipient of Nobel prize for literature, added this: “The worst sin against our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them. That's the essence of inhumanity.” And Albert Einstein, the famed Nobel scientist, stated: \"The world is a dangerous place, not [just] because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.\"\n\nIndeed, the most dangerous people are those who don’t care. Those who choose to remain silent when they should speak out or do something. Because of their indifference or apathy, many innocent people have suffered injustice and even death. Examples of the high cost of indifference include the holocaust against the Jews, the genocide against the Tutsis of Rwanda, and, more recently, the persecution, ethnic cleansing, and genocide against the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar.\n\nThus, apart from the active perpetrators of human atrocities and injustices, the nameless criminals are the passive actors: Those of us who remain silent, when when our actions and voices can make a difference. We who are spineless when we’re expected to stand up and be counted; we who play it safe, by going along without much protest; and we who choose the path of noninvolvement or neutrality. But as Desmond Tutu reminds us, “If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.” To be neutral in situations of injustice is to be complicit in those acts of injustice.\n\nThe greatest problem in all our interactions or relationships—whether with others or with God—is not that we’re too hot or too cold, but rather that we’re lukewarm. Lukewarmness (another description for apathy or indifference) is the one sin that makes God Himself want to throw up (cf. Revelation 3:15-16).\n\nAre you tempted to shrug your shoulders to a need or an injustice? Are you saying dismissively, \"It’s none of my business” or “I don’t have the time or the means to do anything about it”? From Christ’s parable of the Good Samaritan we learn that the antidote to the indifference of the priest and the Levite is the caring actions of the Samaritan. Those who make a difference in the world are not indifferent. Rather, they show concern; they care; they do what they can. They display empathy, not apathy (Luke 10:30-37; cf. Isaiah 59:9-15).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nTHE POWER OF TOGETHERNESS (WE THE WE)\n\nIt’s never well when “I” thinks it's “We.” When a single note believes it’s the orchestra, and when “We the people” is interpreted to mean “I am the we.” The lure to “go my separate way” or “do my own thing” is the ailment of our time—whether in the home, society, church, or United Nations. Something is wrong when the ignorance of “I” boasts of its wisdom; when self-centered rebellion usurps unity and togetherness; and when the delusion of lone-rangerism claims enlightenment. Even God is a team of Three; Creation is a “let us” event; and the joy of Eden is a complementarity of the “we” of Adam and Eve. In the words of Malcolm X, “When ‘i’ is replaced with ‘we’ even illness becomes wellness.”\n\nLet's redeem the “we,” through the power of togetherness. For, as the African writer Chinua Achebe aptly explains: “When we gather together in the moonlight village ground, it is not because of the moon. Every man can see it in his own compound. We come together because it is good for kinsmen to do so. Therefore, let us continue with the team spirit and enjoy the power of togetherness. Let's smile not because we don't have problems but because we are stronger than the problems. Together we have an identity that couldn't be achieved individually.” It’s why we must come together, stay together, work together, pray together, and worship together. “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!” (Psalms 133:1)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nGETTING EVEN IS NEVER EVEN\n\nRevenge may feel right and even seem justified, but it’s damaging to us and the people we love. When, as a child, I bore a grudge or was tempted to retaliate for some unfairness or injustice, my mother would say: “An enraged mother hen who throws her eggs at a hawk for snatching one of her chicks only hurts herself the second time.” Getting even—vengeance, tit-for-tat, “an eye for an eye”—is never even. It inflicts more pain upon us than upon those who have hurt us. Rather than bring closure, revenge keeps the wounds open and fresh, and inflicts new injuries.\n\nSir Francis Bacon said, \"In taking revenge a man isn’t even with his enemy, he is only as low as they. But in passing over it he becomes superior, for it is a prince’s part to pardon.\" “There’s no revenge so complete as forgiveness” (Josh Billings).\n\nHave you been wronged or wounded? Defrauded or taken advantage of? Have you been slandered, and your good reputation ruined? Has anyone in any way so hurt you that you’re sorely tempted to retaliate or revenge? Let go! The damage has already been done; the loss already been incurred; the injury, insult, and humiliation has already been suffered; and those painful words have already been hurled at you. Revenge cannot undo or compensate for the damage. Don’t get even for your hurt, get beyond it by forgiving. Let God deal with the one who has hurt you, if the person doesn’t repent.\n\nMother Hen, the enemy hawk has already inflicted damage by snatching your precious chick. There is nothing you can do to bring her back. Why inflict a second wound upon yourself, by throwing at the enemy your future yet unborn? Getting even is never even. It comes at a price of an additional injury. Just let go! (Romans 12:19-21; 1 Peter 2:21-23) —Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nCRAZY TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING?\n\nFor its 30th anniversary of the “Just Do It” slogan, Nike, the American multinational shoes and clothing company, launched a new advertising commercial this week (on September 5, 2018). The ad, which features many athletes from different walks of life, is narrated by an outstanding, but politically controversial, US footballer. It opens with these daring words:\n\n“If people say your dreams are crazy. If they laugh at what they think you can do, good! Stay that way. Because what non-believers fail to understand is that calling a dream crazy is not an insult, it’s a compliment.” The Nike commercial then builds up to these punchy lines: “Don’t believe you have to be like anybody, to be somebody…. Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything…. So don’t ask if your dreams are crazy. Ask if they’re crazy enough.” And just as the narration ends, the following words and the Nike logo are flashed on the screen: “It’s crazy enough until you do it. Just do it.”\n\nThe 2-minute \"Just Do It\" commercial is brilliant, attention-grabbing, and inspirational—even if one believes the Nike ad is motivated by financial or political considerations. Also, whether or not we agree with the social activism of the narrator, one cannot ignore the powerful words Nike placed on the lips of Colin Kaepernick, that outstanding US footballer who, in 2016, ignited a political controversy by choosing to kneel on one knee rather than stand while the US national anthem was being played before the start of football games—and paying a price for it. The apt tagline from his protest lips are: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”\n\nIn my opinion, Nike couldn't have found a better messenger and face for its \"Just Do It\" label than a first-class player who is willing to take an unpopular stand to highlight racial injustice, and to risk all for a cause he believes in. Also, the powerful statement, urging us to “believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything,” resonates at different levels—whether it’s sports, politics, personal aspiration, self-motivation, or even faith.\n\nHowever, I’ll hasten to add that, on issues of religion and ethics, it’s never wise to just “believe in something” or to \"just do it.\" Instead of mindlessly heeding bumper-sticker slogans, a better way is to first “prove all things, and [then] hold fast [to] that which is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21).\n\nBelieve in something if it’s true, and just do it if it’s right. To believe and to do otherwise is not only laughable, but crazy.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nINDELIBLE IMPRINTS\n\nRecent deaths of some close personal friends and certain influential leaders have challenged me anew to ask questions about the people I greatly admire: Who do I consider as my heroes, why do I embrace them as such, and how do I best honor them? As I’ve reflected on these questions, I’ve discovered some common traits in their lives:\n\nMy heroes and heroines tend to be counter-cultural or non-conformists. Because they know who they are, what they stand for, and why they were born, they refuse to go along in order to get along. They are daring, hard working, and excelling. They sacrifice and risk their lives for causes bigger than themselves. They're humble in their accomplishments, generous in their giving, and respectful and kind even to their adversaries.\n\nThe two words that best describe my true heroes are “silent sufferers.” They bear pain patiently, without grudge or complaint. Often, on account of their forgiving spirit, they are perceived as fools and are taken advantage of. And because they are years ahead of their time, silent sufferers also easily get misunderstood and misrepresented—until after their death.\n\nBut real heroes never die. They live on through the indelible imprints they make on our lives, influencing our major decisions and actions. Do you have your own hero or heroine? What would you say about them if called upon to deliver eulogies at their funerals? Let’s honor them by embracing their values, enlisting in their causes, emulating their examples, and continuing where they fell short or left off (Psalm 16:3).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nDEATH FOR MY ENEMY\n\nHave you ever wished death for your enemy—the one who deeply hates you and has persistently tried to destroy you? Have you ever sought the worst punishment upon this mortal enemy who has inflicted so much pain, sorrow, and grief upon you and your loved ones? I must confess that I have, but the enemy I have in mind is Death itself. I have wished the death of Death. Yes, Death is my enemy. Our enemy. From time to time—nay, time after time—we are reminded that Death is a very cruel enemy. Once determined on taking life, there’s no amount of pleading, tears, or prayers that can change his heartless heart. What makes him peculiarly an enemy is how he deceitfully wormed his way into our lives. He fraudulently sneaked into our company through the window of sin. And ever since, he has spared no one. Not even the Prince of Life. (The irony is that Christ’s death was the means by which He defeated Death!) I’m comforted that when Jesus Christ comes to reign as King of kings and Lord of lords, He will destroy all our enemies and “the last enemy to be destroyed is death (1 Corinthians 15:26). Our mortal enemy will die! I can’t wait to throw this jab at him: “O Death, where is your sting? O Hades [Grave], where is your victory?” (v. 55). Have you been wounded by Death? Take heart, for Death’s days are numbered.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nSUICIDAL WOUNDS\n\nThe worst wounds that can ever be inflicted upon us are those we inflict upon ourselves by our decision not to forgive those who have wounded us. Unforgiveness is as dangerous as cancer. It eats away at us from the inside. It deprives us of our peace of mind. It holds us in perpetual bondage to the person who wounded us, and the Bible makes it clear that those who do not forgive will themselves not be forgiven by God (Matthew 6:14-15; 18:21-35). Thus, when we choose not to forgive—not to let go of—something that is eating us up, we commit spiritual suicide. And the suicidal wounds of unforgiveness can be fatal to the quality of our lives now and even affect our eternal destiny. We may not have had a choice over the actions of the people who inflicted painful wounds upon us. But we do have a choice over how we respond: We can either choose to forgive them or choose to remain in their bondage. And let’s not forget this: Jesus didn’t die for us alone, He also died for those who have wounded us. Do they deserve forgiveness? No. But then, do we?—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWE’RE OUR OWN TEMPTATION\n\nSomeone wrote: “The Devil tempts men most when they have money. He tempts women most when they don't have money. For us to keep the Devil away, my brothers, if you get money give it to your wife so that while you walk without money, she walks with money and the Devil is kept away!” Interesting, but keeping the Devil’s temptation away is not quite that simple. Besides money, Satan also entices through power, pleasure, ambition, applause, flattery, fantasy, needs, and just about any desire that appeals to our carnal hearts and pride. The reason we yield to temptation is because deep within our hearts is a sinful desire that lies dormant, and awaits activation by some external stimulus or agent. A fall may occur when “evil within” is perfectly timed or synchronized with a tempting “evil without.” The Bible says: “Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death” (James 1:14, 15). We’re our own temptation! To keep the Devil away requires a Power that can defeat Satan and which can also cleanse the heart from its inherent selfish desires. We read: \"The Son of God came into the world to destroy the works of the devil…I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you… Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (1 John 3:8; Ezekiel 36:26; James 4:7; cf. Mark 7:21-23; Ezekiel 18:30-32).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nHOPE THROUGH THE DARK\n\nWithout the dark we cannot clearly see the stars. Similarly, the dark moments of adversity often reveal some of life’s most valuable gifts or blessings. What initially comes disguised as painful experiences are often used by God to deepen our spiritual walk and outlook on life. Fyodor Dostoyevsky said it best: “The darker the night, the brighter the stars; the deeper the grief, the closer is God!” Are you wondering about the dark moments in your life? Read the Book of Job, then take comfort in these words by Wintley Phipps: “It is in the quiet crucible of your personal, private sufferings that your noblest dreams are born and God’s greatest gifts are given in compensation for what you’ve been through.” Hope through the dark. The brightest stars have known the darkest nights. “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning” (Psalm 30:5).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nMUST EAGLES BE SILENT?\n\nThough outnumbered and oft-vilified, eagles in the land of chickens must speak out. For when Eagles are silent, noise is equated with wisdom, propaganda with truth, and gossip with gospel. Regrettably, Eagles in Chickenland are often silent because: they’re tired or feel it’s no use; their voices have been banned; they’re nursing their wounds (whether self-inflicted or by friendly-fire, opportunists, or vicious enemies); they feel it’s not safe (the air, water, & food have been poisoned, & many snares have been laid to entrap them); or they’re waiting for a better time. Though costly, the cause is too great for Eagles to remain silent! They betray a sacred trust if they don’t speak out; and they expose others to danger if they remain silent. How can they allow chickens to silence them, after the Lord has done so much for them? (2 Timothy 4:1-5; Ezekiel 33:6, 7; Judges 5:23; 2 Kings 7:9). No, Eagles must not be silent! They must speak out and speak NOW—through their words, actions, and sacrificial service.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nTELL YOUR STORY\n\nYou have a story to tell, and a duty to share it. It’s the story of what you’ve been through and of God’s mighty deliverances, providential leadings, and tender mercies in your life. Your story may not be pretty or exciting, but even an ugly & painful story needs to be told to instruct, warn, and encourage others. Your story today may not be complete, for you still have struggles and battles. Still, tell the unfolding story of what God is doing in your life. For, amazingly, your story is part of God’s Big Story—the story of His saving grace and love, and of His power to turn what was meant for evil to your good. Never be afraid nor ashamed to tell your unique story. Like the healed demoniac, go to others and “tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you” (Mark 5:19; Luke 8:39; Genesis 50:20). We have a duty to do so: “Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story…“ (Psalm 107:2; NIV). Now is the time to share your personal testimony. Tell your story to His glory!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nLOOKING BACK\n\n“We ought not to look back, unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors and for the purpose of profiting by dear-bought experience” (George Washington). Here’s how to benefit from regretful experiences of the past: Graciously accept your defeats; humbly admit your failures; willingly accept the consequences of your mistakes; ardently learn from your missteps; courageously ignore your adversaries and distractors; freely forgive those who have hurt you; and fully surrender your hopes to God’s will. You cannot undo nor ignore the past. But you can make sure you don't repeat what you did or failed to do. Setbacks shouldn’t set you back. They are stepping-stones. Step on the stones and you’ll move upward and forward. Look back, but don’t dwell there. Where you’re going is much more important than where you've been (Philippians 3:13, 14; Isaiah 43:18, 19.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE HOUND OF HEAVEN\n\nIt’s a relentless and determined love. Francis Thompson’s (1859–1907) famous poem calls it “the Hound of Heaven,” evoking the imagery of a well-trained dog (hound) pursuing its prey with undeviating tenacity—until it wins. Alluding to the poem, Ken McFarland explains God’s determined love: “You can ignore Him days without number. You can reject Him. You can deny that He exists. You can mock and ridicule and curse Him. You can claim His name but play the Devil’s game. You can be ashamed of Him. You can hate Him bitterly. You can run away from Him. You can pledge your allegiance to His greatest enemy. You can squander on your own gratification all His gifts to you. You can defy Him. You can portray Him to others as severe and ruthless and uncaring. You can shut Him totally out of your life. You can blame Him for all the evil in your world. You can whip Him till He bleeds and spit on Him and nail Him to a cross and laugh while He dies of a broken heart. You can do all this. But one thing you can never do. You can never make Him stop loving you. Never.” In sin, you may try to run away or hide from Him. But God’s determined love will not let you go. “The Hound of Heaven” will relentlessly pursue you—until you make it to Heaven (Romans 8:31-39; John 3:16; 14:1-3).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nSTAY FRESH\n\nMy advice to graduates: You can’t eat your certificates. Knowledge can become stale. Therefore, stay fresh. When you graduate today, and stop learning tomorrow, you’d become an illiterate the next day. There are many graduates who, for all practical intents and purposes, are functional illiterates. Don’t increase the population of this uneducated class. Don't’ be an illiterate grad. There’s never an end to learning, unlearning, and relearning. Constantly grow in knowledge—both in your field of study and in your spiritual pursuits. Even the all-knowing “Jesus GREW in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man” (Luke 2:52). He kept learning. Illiterate grads drink from the stagnant pond, but the truly educated draw from the running stream. Stay fresh. Keep growing and learning. Always!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWHO IS YOUR REAL MOTHER?\n\nYour real mother is not necessarily the woman who carried you in the womb or gave birth to you. She is not even the woman who raised or cared for you (e.g., adoptive mother, step-mother, guardian, grandmother, aunt, big sister, or social worker). Motherhood is much more than biology (nature) and sociology (nurture); it’s also theology (Scripture). To His own question, “Who is My MOTHER, or My brothers?” Jesus explained, “Whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and MOTHER” (Mark 3:33-35). True motherhood (or kinship) is much more than genetics, pedigree, or nurturing; it is a spiritual relationship. Your real mother is that caring woman who leads you to discover and do God’s will. She’s that person who equips you for usefulness and service in this world AND in the world to come. Your real mother (dead or alive) is that woman who still lives in you through the spiritual values & principles that govern your life today and prepares you for Heaven. Take a moment to reflect, then look for your real mother(s). Thank God for them, and tangibly wish them a Happy Mother’s Day. And if you’re a woman, ask yourself if you are a real mother.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nBETTER BE WRONGED THAN TO WRONG\n\nHave you been defrauded, taken advantage of, or victimized? Been ill-treated, mistreated, or persecuted? And are you tempted to get even or fight it out? WHEN YOU’RE RIGHT, SURRENDER YOUR RIGHT. The voluntary surrender of our rights calls for dying to self. Jesus did not insist on His rights; He took our wrongs. “Crucified with Christ,” our attitude will be like Paul’s (Galatians 2:20). Leonard Ravenhill explains: “[Paul] had no ambitions [for himself]—and so had nothing to be jealous about. He had no reputation—and so had nothing to fight about. He had no possessions—and therefore had nothing to worry about. He had no rights—so therefore he could not suffer wrong. He was already broken—so no one could break him. He was dead—so none could kill him. He was less than the least—so who could humble him? He had suffered the loss of all things—so none could defraud him.” Have you been wronged? Are you tempted to revenge or go to court? Paul asks: “Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?” (1 Corinthians 6:7; cf. 1 Peter 2:18-23). It’s better to be wronged than to wrong. For Christ’s sake, when you’re right, surrender your right.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nAUDACITY OF CHICKEN LEADERSHIP\n\nAlas, today we’ve allowed the chickens to lead the Eagles! We know this when consciences don't catch fire for noble and just causes. When competence is determined by age, degrees, pedigree, and blind agreement. When activity counts, and not productivity. When self-interest and greed reign supreme. We know chickens are in charge when emotions trump common sense, fears melt courage, and the clamor of ignorant, dysfunctional, and self-seeking vigilantes usurp principled decisions. Chickens are in control when watching TV is preferred to reading, When falsehoods are alternative facts, meanness hailed as frankness, and accountability castigated as persecution. Tragically, in much of society and church, our deluded chickens convince themselves that they’re actually eagles, and parade their clueless, spineless, mediocre, & erratic leadership as administrative savvy. Yes, in the church too! The audacity of chicken leadership! Where are the Eagles? (Jeremiah 5:1; Ezekiel 22:30).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nEVEN IN THE WELL\n\nLife often traps us with despairing situations. In 2010, 33 Chilean miners were trapped 700 meters underground, about 3 miles from the mine's entrance. After 17 fretful days, a message appeared, taped to a drill bit (the tool used to cut or crush rock): \"We are well in the shelter, the 33 of us.\" 69 days later, the miners were brought out to safety. In life, we often find ourselves down in the pits. We get trapped in life's well through our own mistakes, the actions of others, or circumstances beyond our control. We feel lost in its frightening depth, unable to see light at the end of the tunnel. Regardless of how you got into your hole, you can choose responsible ways from sinking into despair. Choose hope, by fastening this assurance to your efforts: IT IS WELL, EVEN IN THE WELL! (Psalm 31:24; 43:5; Zechariah 9:11-12.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE MOST-WOUNDED EAGLE\n\nWithout exception, every human being who ever lived was once wounded. Wounded by sin. This includes our Lord Jesus Christ—except that, unlike every other individual, Christ’s wounds were not self-inflicted. He was wounded by someone else—by everyone else. By us. You and me. Though He lived a sinless life, our sin caused His fatal wound, His crucifixional death at Calvary. Jesus Christ is the Exceptional Eagle. Thus, His wounded-ness is unique.\n\nNo one else in human history has experienced a deeper, uglier, and a more undeserved wounds of greater suffering than our Lord Jesus Christ. He was The Most-Wounded Eagle. “He was WOUNDED for our transgressions, He was BRUISED for our iniquities; the CHASTISEMENT for our peace was upon Him, and by His STRIPES we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5; NKJV).\n\nBut Jesus Christ, The Most-Wounded Eagle, is also the Wounded HEALER. (\"By His stripes we are HEALED”). Because He experienced all our wounds, He is able to heal all wounded eagles. The wounded-ness of Christ is God’s definitive answer to the problem of human wounds—human sin, alienation, and death.\n\nAre you a wounded eagle? Are you discouraged because you are hurting from self-inflicted wounds of failure? Don't lose hope. Jesus Christ, the Wounded Healer will heal you. Go to Him with your bruises and wounds, for there is “healing in His wings” (Malachi 4:2; Zechariah 13:6; Luke 15:11-32).\n\n“Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. ‘With His stripes we are healed’” (E. G. White, Desire of Ages, p. 25).\n\nDon't be discouraged, Wounded Eagle. Don't give up hope. You may be wounded, but you're still an EAGLE. God's Eagle. Because of the wounds of Christ, The Most-Wounded Eagle, you can heal to soar again. The Wounded Healer is your hope.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\n(For previous nuggets, visit: http://eaglesonline.org/weekly-nuggets/nuggets-archives/)\n\nADVICE TO WOUNDED EAGLES\n\n“Think of me as a fellow-patient in the same hospital who, having been admitted a little earlier, could give some advice” (C.S. Lewis). In the steps of Lewis, I also could give some “advice” to wounded eagles—all who, in spite of their commitment to excellence, have fallen short of God’s ideals. Regrettably, eagles sometimes get wounded. Their wounds, often the result of tiredness, weakness, accidents, attacks from enemies and frenemies, and in some cases from their own self-inflicted wounds of foolish mistakes, selfishness and pride. Here’s my advice: A wounded cat is still a cat, not a rat. A wounded dog is still a dog, not a frog. Similarly, a wounded eagle is still an EAGLE, and not a chicken or a turkey! Through Christ’s enabling grace, wounded eagles can heal and soar again (cf. Isaiah 40:27-31; Psalm 103:1-5). Be not discouraged, wounded eagles. You’re still God’s Eagle!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWHY? WHY ME? WHY NOW?\n\nWe become philosophers when sudden adversities strike. When our worlds fall apart without warning: fatal illness diagnosed, death strikes, loss or failure suffered, divorce, broken relationship or rejection experienced, or hurt by betrayal, slander, or hatred. It’s then we ask, “Why this? Why Me? Why Now?” But, “Why not? If not you, who would you suggest? And if not now, would you have preferred last week or tomorrow?” In the face of life-shattering experiences, it is sometimes helpful to recognize that there are things we can never fully understand in this side of the world. One day, however, God will make plain his purpose in allowing those things in our lives. Jesus told Peter: “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this” (John 13:7). Rather than frustrating ourselves with the “Why” questions, or complaining and arguing with God, we must simply defer our questions to a future time. More often than not, time gives a better perspective of things on our painful and difficult experiences.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nBE THE ONE\n\n“If you think you're too small to make a difference, you haven't spent a night with a mosquito” (African Proverb). Just because you’re the only one doesn’t mean your presence, voice, or efforts don’t count. An unknown author uses a typewriter’s missing key to illustrate the incredible power of one: “If you'rx having onx of thosx days whxn you think you just arxn't vxry important, and you'rx txmptxd to slack off, rxmxmbxr this old typxwritxr. You arx a kxy pxrson, and whxn you don't do your bxst, nothing xlsx around you works out thx way it is supposxd to.” One is not too small to not count. It is not too little to make a difference. And not too ordinary to have an impact. Therefore, don’t underestimate the power of one. God is looking for one person to make a difference. Be that one. (Ezekiel 22:30).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nFAILURE IS NEVER FINAL\n\nHave you been stung by failure? Are you hurting from the shame of your self-inflicted wounds? Have you lost hope, feeling that your relationship, health, studies, business, or profession is over? FAILURE IS NEVER FINAL! You can bounce back and thrive again—IF you respond in humility and repentance. After Nebuchadnezzar’s failure and humiliation, God’s grace reversed his misfortunes: “I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my understanding RETURNED to me… My reason RETURNED to me, … my honor and splendor RETURNED to me. My counselors and nobles RESORTED to me, I was RESTORED to my kingdom, and excellent majesty was ADDED to me” (Daniel 4:34, 36). Don’t be discouraged by the pain, loss, shame, gossip, slander, gloating, and other malicious acts that attend failure. “Lift up your eyes to heaven” and bounce back. That’s restoration! Don't give up. IT'S NOT OVER! After failure empties your cup, God’s grace can fill it to its brim again! (Proverbs 24:16; Micah 7:8; Psalm 37:23, 24.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHINK FOR YOURSELF\n\nIt’s easier to feel than to think. And many who think they’re thinking are either parroting the thoughts of others or merely re-arranging their prejudices. Thinking is hard, for it forces us to analyze facts before we finalize acts. And, conclusions based on thinking are not always pleasant. But we must think! Whenever we abdicate our ability to think, or replace it with some superficial, emotional experience, we are in danger of being deceived, deluded, or unwittingly inflicting harm on others. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.” Think for yourself! If you don’t think for yourself, someone will do the thinking for you. Which is why Jesus repeatedly asked, “What do you think?” (cf. Matthew 17:25; 18:12; 21:28; 22:17, 42.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nGIVERS & TAKERS\n\n“No person was ever honored for what he received. He was honored for what he gave” (Calvin Coolidge). We say “we’re blessed” when we receive something. But, Jesus said, we’re “MORE blessed” when we give than when we receive\" (Acts 20:35). This principle holds for individuals, organizations, businesses, and nations. To constantly receive and not give is to be selfish and impoverished. It’s why the Dead Sea is dead while the Sea of Galilee is alive. “True generosity doesn’t start when you have some thing to give, but rather when there’s nothing in you that’s trying to take” (Nipun Mehta). You want to be blessed? Give SACRIFICIALLY and GENEROUSLY—of your time, money, knowledge, sympathy, friendship, kindness, forgiveness, etc. (Proverbs 11: 24-26; Psalm 41:1-3; Luke 6:38). Be a giver, not a taker!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nOUR CREED OF GREED\n\nWhy are people so corrupt? It’s because they’re just like us! By default, corruption is our religion, and greed is our creed. We are the canonized saints in this religion, whether we go to church on Saturdays or Sundays, to the mosque on Fridays, or to some other shrines on Somedays and Nonedays: “Every human being is intrinsically selfish and will act to the dictates of this selfishness unless there's a system that threatens to hurt his/her ego beyond the value of the selfish interest” (Justice N. Bawole). Threats and punishments from human systems can mitigate corruption, but to win the fight against corruption our selfish hearts must be totally transformed (Isaiah 1:4-6; 18; Mark 7:21, 22; Romans 12:2).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nQUIT SELF-PITY\n\nOne doesn't have to be good-looking, talented, intelligent, powerful, or rich to be proud. Pride also infects some of the ugliest, seemingly ungifted, ignorant, oppressed, and poorest people. SELF-PITY is the pride of the weak and suffering. It’s the most subtle form of pride because, while pretending to be very needy, it is actually unrenewed self clamoring for attention. Priding itself in its deprived status, self-pity often masquerades as “humility.” It’s delusional, seeing itself as “a victim”—whether of circumstances or of self-inflicted choices and actions Self-pity is all about being indulgently selfish—and perfectly miserable. As branded-pride for the disadvantaged, it begins innocently as “Why Me,” but quickly grows to dethrone God and enthrone SELF. When self-pity refuses to acknowledge its loathsome condition, it is incurable and deadly. Quit it! (Proverbs 29:23; James 4:6).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nDON’T HYPE THE NEW YEAR\n\n“Happy New Year” is an overrated phrase, if not, sometimes, a meaningless wish. 1) How can we wish it to anyone when HAPPINESS means different things to different people? 2) What is really NEW about the year? Chances are we’re going to live and do the same old things. Forget the hype, inflated expectations, and one-day wonder resolutions! The new YEAR is only new when there’s a new PERSON—one with a new spirit and a new set of values. “Happy New Year” should not be a wish; it must be a will. Not a change on a calendar date, but a change from within. Not a new year, but a new YOU! “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17; Matthew 5:1-10). Is it \"Happy New Year!\" yet for you? It starts with being a better version of yourself.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE GIFT OF SANKOFA\n\nThe gift of Sankofa challenges the oft-given advice, “Never look back”—at least, the “never” part. “Sankofa,” a Twi word from Ghana literally means “go back and get it.” It is used in proverbs and symbols (e.g., the symbolic Sankofa bird, with its head turned backwards carrying an egg in its mouth) to mean, “go back to the past and bring forward that which is useful.” The Bible doesn’t begin with the birth of Jesus Christ, but with the book of Genesis (or origins, beginnings, or birth of everything)—thus, inviting us to look back. As you wrap up plans and gifts for Christmas, New Year, and other special occasions, be sure to offer yourself a Sankofa gift. Take a long, hard look at your personal, professional, and spiritual life. You can’t live in the past, but you can learn from the it (cf. Haggai 1:5, 7).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE SECOND HALF OF LIFE\n\nThe second half of life begins after 40, and it can be (or should be) the best years of your life. Caleb conquered walled-cities and giants during the second half. At age 85, he was “as strong as he was at 40” (Joshua 14:6-15). Do you feel that the first half of your life has been more or less a failure? Do you regret the wasted opportunities, the misplaced priorities, and bad choices that have been very costly to you and your loved ones? Remember the Old Testament priest Eli. After failing woefully as a father and spiritual leader, he offered his most valuable contribution to his nation during the second half—when he mentored Samuel to become one of the greatest prophets in Israel’s history. It’s never too late! With God’s help, your greatest contributions will occur in the second half of your life.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nREASONS TO BE THANKFUL\n\nAn elderly lady in a nursing home said, “I thank you, Lord, for two good teeth, one upper and one lower. And I thank you that they meet!” She was thankful for little things. Fanny Crosby (1820-1915) wrote more than 9,000 hymns during her lifetime. When she was just six weeks old, she became blind for life—due to a doctor’s incompetence. But despite her blindness, she refused to be bitter or feel sorry for herself: “If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me.” She was thankful for trials and afflictions. There’s ALWAYS something to be thankful for (Philippians 4:6, 7; Psalm 103:1-5). Find yours today!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nLIFE’S INTERRUPTIONS\n\nThe journey called life is full of interruptions. But these ought not terminate the journey. Life’s road is not always paved with asphalt, it’s more often with gravel and potholes. There are ups and downs, twists and turns, roadblocks and detours. We experience flat tires, breakdowns, and accidents. And, through miscalculation, we sometimes run out of fuel and even receive speeding tickets. These interruptions may frustrate and inconvenience, and may even delay or alter our travel plans. But if you know where you’re going and why, no obstacle or extra expense can stop you. Are you experiencing disruptions in your life? Let your destination and purpose summon your resourcefulness. Press on! (Philippians 3:4; cf. Mark 2:1-12.)-- Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nYOUR ROUGH MOUNTAINS\n\nThere are no smooth mountains. If our mountains were smooth, they would be difficult to climb. So, when God gives us mountains to climb, He leaves them rough. The bumps and rocks along the way—the obstacles and hurdles in our path—are actually stepping stones in our mountain climb. Thank God for your rough mountains—your trials and afflictions, your temptations and setbacks, your disappointments and sorrows. Without these jagged sides of life, there’ll be no maturity and growth, nor mountaintop experiences. Faith climbs rough mountains. Therefore, welcome your struggles and challenges. By faith, Caleb said: “Give me the mountain” (Joshua 14:12). May we dare to say: “Give me my ROUGH mountain.”—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nPEACE OR PIECES?\n\n“You can bomb the world to pieces, but you can't bomb it into peace” (Michael Franti & Spearhead). Anger and violence seldom solve problems. So, don’t let bitterness and rage steal your sweetness and gentleness. Commit with Max Lucado: “I choose gentleness… Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle. If I raise my voice may it be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it be only in prayer. If I make a demand, may it be only of myself.” Are you sorely provoked or hurt? “Let your gentleness be known to all men” (Philippians 4:5; cf. Romans 12:18). To right wrongs, write injuries in sand, and for each grievance, engrave gentleness in granite. The conquests of gentleness outlast the victories of violence.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE EYE OF THE STORM\n\nThe safest place to be in a fierce storm is right in the middle of it, the “eye of the storm.” It is a roughly circular area, typically 20–40 miles (30–65 km) in diameter, and is surrounded by the eyewall, the most violent part of the storm. Winds in the eyewall can blow at dangerous speeds of more than 155 miles per hour (250 km/h), causing havoc and death on their path. But the condition in the eye of a storm is calm or peaceful, with clear skies or sunshine, little or no precipitation, and light, gentle breezes. Are you facing violent storms in your life? Are life’s furious winds of confusion and devastation swirling around you? Move to the CENTER! Connected with Christ, you can be there in “perfect peace” (Isaiah 26:3; John 16:33; cf. Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 4:35-41).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nHALLELUJAH TIME or HOSANNA TIME?\n\nThere are special moments in life to express deep emotions in the face of our ups and downs: The times of HALLELUJAH (“praise the Lord” or “God be praised”) celebrate incredible breakthroughs and deliverances, and the times of HOSANNA (“I beg you to save!” or “Please deliver us!”) plead earnestly for help in serious crises. Psalm 107:4-32 reminds us that life is not only full of painful disruptive moments, but is also punctuated with amazing moments of divine interventions. What time is it for you today? Hosanna time? Earnestly cry out to the Lord (vv. 6, 13, 19, 28). Hallelujah time? Celebrate by telling your story (vv. 8, 15, 21, 31). God’s grace runs through both our Hallelujah and Hosanna times (v.43).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHANK YOU, PAIN!\n\nPain is never appreciated as a gift until God unwraps it. He grabs our attention when we’re in pain and, through its refining process, He brings the best out of us. Writes the prophet Isaiah “Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction” (Isaiah 48:10). Pain is a “blessing,” so wrote Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918–2008), the Russian literary giant and outspoken critic of Soviet communism. Describing his 11 years of suffering in forced labor camps and exile, and its effect on him, he said: “It was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good...That is why I turn back to the years of my imprisonment and say…‘Bless you, prison, for having been in my life!’” One day, we also will look back on our prisons of trials and afflictions, and say, “Thank you, Pain, for coming into my life!” (Psalm 119:67, 71, 75; Romans 5:3, 4.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHROUGH THE STORMS\n\nViolent storms are raging in our world—and in our lives. We’re afraid, we’re out of options, we’re out of ideas, and are frustrated. We’re “at our wits’ end”—a phrase that means “to be so worried, confused, or annoyed that you do not know what to do next” (Cambridge Dictionary). That idiom is from the King James Bible in the 1600s. In Psalm 107:27, it was used when fishermen in the deep oceans faced life-threatening storms in which they felt desperate, powerless and helpless. (The Hebrew of the Ps 107:27 phrase “at wits’ end” literally says “their wisdom was swallowed up.”) How do you face storms in your life? Psalm 107:28-30 assures us that when we “cry to the Lord in our troubles and distresses,” He will calm the storm and the waves, bring peace to our hearts, and guide us safely to “our desired haven.” At your wits’ end? The way up is the only way out.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nDISRUPTIVE MOMENTS\n\nThey are sudden, painful, and life-shattering. Gordon MacDonald calls them “disruptive moments.” They are “those unanticipated moments, most of which, one would usually have chosen to avoid had it been possible.” He goes on to say, “We don’t like disruptive moments; they are too often associated with inconvenience, failure and humiliation….” But whether self-inflicted or inflicted on us, let’s consider them as “providential afflictions.” For, through them, God grabs our attention to change our priorities & perspectives. David says: “Before I was AFFLICTED I went astray, but now I keep Your word….It is good for me that I have been AFFLICTED, that I may learn Your statutes….I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are right, and that in faithfulness You have AFFLICTED me.” (Psalm 119:67, 71, 75). Take comfort: Our painful interruptions in life are God’s providential afflictions!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWE ARE ADOPTED\n\nOur Father has many children—and still wants more! We were all adopted. With His limitless resources and wisdom, He cares for each one of us—as though we are the only ones He has. None of us has seen our Father—the only exception being our Elder Brother who has always lived with Him and who came to live with us for a short time. Thus, our only knowledge of our Father is what our senior Brother has revealed about Him. He tells us that our Father is a King, the ruler of a vast kingdom. That our family here is an extension of a larger family. Before He departed to be with Father, Big Brother said, “I go to my Father and your Father” (John 20:17). And to remind us to boldly approach Him with anything, He taught us to call Him “ABBA, Father” (Mark 14:36, Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:5, 6). This special name of endearment expresses the close, intimate relationship we have with Him. Just as a trusting child comes to \"Daddy\" to tell him anything, we also can tell “Abba, Father” anything that is on our hearts. Anything and everything! Our joys, our sorrows, our worries, our hurts, and our struggles. We can confidently approach Him with the things we need and the things we’re thankful for. We can share with Him our deepest thoughts and feelings, our deepest desires and longings, and our most painful and embarrassing experiences—including the sins we wrestle with. Yes, we can bring them all to our loving Father, and know that He will hear us with a sympathetic heart, a heart of love and kindness. Yes, we do have a living, loving, and eternal Heavenly Father, and we will always have His shoulders to lean on and His embrace to sustain us. Why? Because we are adopted—and He is our ABBA, Father.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWOUNDED SOLDIERS\n\n“The Christian army is the only army that shoots and buries its wounded…. We [also] leave them to bleed to death in the field” (Freddie Gage). How true of how Christians treat their erring ones! Even the Church that’s to be a hospital for sinners often becomes a slaughter house where the saints butcher those experiencing personal failures—their fallen, faltering, or failing (cf. John 8:1-11; Luke 15:25-32; Mark 14:1-9). Are you a wounded soldier? Don’t quit fighting, for the enemy will kill you if he finds you. Remember, a wounded soldier is still a soldier. A wounded Samson brought down the Philistine kingdom. And a wounded Savior took down the gates of hell with Him. “Being wounded is not the end; it is the beginning of a new frontier in battle” (Noel Masvosvere).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH\n\nThe CEO of Facebook began his 2017 Harvard graduation speech thus: “I’m not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose. … I’m here to tell you finding your purpose isn’t enough. The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose” (Mark Zuckerberg). To his apt observation I add that it is not even enough for everyone to have a sense of purpose. We must also LIVE our purpose! In His own commencement address to the world—His Sermon on the Mount—Jesus said: “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, … it is then good for nothing” (Matthew 5:13). Stated differently, salt is good for something, but tasteless salt is worthless (cf. Luke 14:34, 35). Being good for something is not good enough. It's why world-changers do not just know their purpose, but live it.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nFEAR NOT!\n\nIt is said that whenever God says, “Fear not,” you must start worrying; for He’ll be asking you to do the impossible! (Think of Abraham, Moses, Gideon, Jeremiah, or Mary). Yet, God's “Fear not” commands are also His promises. An estimated 365 “fear not” promises are in the Bible—at least one for each day’s need. Therefore, when it seems like you're finished or it’s over and there's no point going on, Jesus says “Fear not; it’s not the end, just the beginning.” (cf. Mark 5: 35, 36). \"The remarkable thing about God is that when you fear God, you fear nothing else, whereas if you do not fear God, you fear everything else” (Oswald Chambers). God has power to intervene, even in your most hopeless situations. Fear not!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nDOUBT YOUR DOUBTS\n\nDoubt whispers the impossible, but faith dares it. “Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing” (Muhammad Ali). Still intimidated by the impossible? Angel Gabriel said, “With God nothing will be impossible” (Luke 1:37). Jesus said, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes…. With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Mark 9:23; Matthew 19:26; cf. Mark 10:27). Doubt your doubts, believe God’s promises! “Natural impossibilities cannot prevent the work of the Omnipotent One” (E.G. White).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nDON’T PRETEND\n\n“We can be anything we want to be, but we can't be anyone we want to be” (Paul Hudson). “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken” (Oscar Wilde). As a child, anytime I pretended to be what I was not, my mother would call me by name and say this proverb: “Tadpole, don’t carry yourself as if you’re a fish.” Just because a tadpole lives in the same pond with baby fishes—and looks and swims like them—should not make it think itself a fish. Our identity (who we really are, not our ambient situation) must dictate how we carry ourselves. We live in a world of pretense. We pretend in order to be liked or get what we want. But pretending can be emotionally draining and sickening. It’s like drinking alcohol or doing drugs: “the more you consume, the worse you feel… the worse you feel, the more you consume. And then one day you take a look at yourself and feel sick to the stomach” (Hudson). Be honest; live without pretending. Be real with people—and with God. (James 2:14-26; John 2:23-25). For a distorted identity can be costly, as the fish-pretending tadpole can easily land itself in a fish-lover’s soup.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nSTOP PRAYING!\n\n“There comes a moment when praying becomes a form of spiritual procrastination. It’s time to stop praying and start acting” (Mark Batterson). Prayer can become a refuge for cowardly fear, an occasion for inaction, and even outright disobedience! It’s why God ordered Moses at the Red Sea to stop praying and \"go forward\" (Exodus 14:15). Daunting waters won't part till we put shoes on our faith. If God's Word is clear on an issue—e.g., forgiving our foes, giving selflessly, or lovingly keeping His Commandments—simply “go forward.” Is there something you know you should do? Stop praying and just do it! Without necessary action, prayers are meaningless gibberish, Pharisaical showmanship, and hypocritical laziness.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nBURN THE PLOWS\n\nThere are moments when we have to make a clean and complete break with the past, without any possibility of turning back to the life we left behind. That’s what Elisha did, when he burned his farming plow. That day he ceased to be Elisha the farmer and began a new life as Elisha the prophet. Similarly, if you really want the past to be behind you, without the option of ever turning back, you’ve got to burn the plowing equipments of your past relationships and attachments, past failures and successes, past careers and goals, and past habits and attitudes. Don’t be fixated to your past experiences—whether painful or glorious. Let the past be past. Don’t look back. Burn the plows (1 Kings 19:21).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nBEING GREAT AGAIN\n\nGreatness is in the air these days. Thanks to Donald Trump, who wants to “make America GREAT again.” Even my home country’s national anthem begs “God [to] bless our homeland Ghana, and make our nation GREAT and strong.” But greatness is not by economic, military, or political might, nor by building walls—literal or metaphorical. Scripture defines true greatness as excellence in humility and sacrificial service. “Greatness is planted in the seedbed of humility, it’s watered by the deeds of servanthood & it’s cultivated by the hands of perseverance until it finally yields the harvest of royalty” (Kris Valloton). Jesus said “Whoever desires to become GREAT among you shall be your servant. And whoever of you desires to be FIRST shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many” (Mark 10:43-45). May the Lord make us TRULY great again.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE SOUND OF SILENCE\n\nSilence is in danger. It’s endangered by the noises of merriment, restlessness, and the cares of this world. When I was a child, I often caught my mother sitting quietly in the dark. Intrigued, I asked what she could possibly see in pitch darkness. She replied, “It’s not so much what you see in darkness as what you hear. The sound of silence you hear in the dark is what keeps you in the daytime.” The noise of noises with which we greeted the New Year should pave the way for the sound of silence, which is what can sustain us through the year. Let’s rescue the sound of silence, that still small voice we hear when we’re alone with God in times of reflection and prayer (Matthew 14:23; cf. 1 Kings 19:11-13). Happy New Year!–Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE PRIVILEGE OF SORROW\n\nSorrow deserves our utmost respect and gratitude. It has mentored some of the wisest, inspired some of the noblest ideals and acts, and refined those privileged by its company. George MacDonald (1824-1905) said it best: “No words can express how much the world owes to sorrow. Most of the Psalms were born in a wilderness. Most of the Epistles were written in a prison. The greatest thoughts of the greatest thinkers have all passed through fire. The greatest poets have ‘learned in suffering what they taught in song.’…Take comfort, afflicted Christian! When God is about to make pre-eminent use of a person, He puts them in the fire.” Sorrow is a privilege. Cherish it! (2 Corinthians 12:7-10)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nHAPPINESS & THANKSGIVING\n\n“Happy Thanksgiving” is more than a wish. It’s also a fact. There’s a direct correlation between happiness and thanksgiving. Those who give thanks are happy, cheerful people. On the other hand, those who’re ungrateful swim in pools of melancholy, misery, despondency, depression, gloom, and unhappiness. It’s as though they were baptized in lemon juice! Let’s stop complaining, and give thanks. “Nothing tends more to promote health of body and of soul than does a spirit of gratitude and praise. It is a positive duty to resist melancholy, discontented thoughts and feelings,—as much a duty as it is to pray” (E.G. White). It’s not happy people who’re thankful; it’s thankful people who’re happy. Therefore, \"in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you\" (1 Thessalonians 5:18).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nCOUNT YOUR BLESSONS\n\nBLESSONS (a combination of “Blessings” + “Lessons”) is a word that refers to painful experiences in life which end up being both valuable lessons and blessings. Incredible as it may seem, even our darkest moments will one day become the object of our praise (cf. Rom 5:3-5; 8:28). Challenges in life are like seeds in a fruit. We can count seeds in a fruit, but we cannot count the fruits potentially hidden in a seed. It takes time, reflection, discernment, and faith to appreciate the fruits of BLESSONS concealed in our seeds of challenges. Are you discouraged, thinking all is lost? “Count your BLESSONS, name them one by one; And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done” (Edwin O. Excell). —Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nGOD AND POLITICS\n\nPolitics can be dirty, divisive, and destructive. And the outcomes of elections can be shocking, painful, and depressing. But God can work through politics. Amidst the complicated interplay of human interests, raw ambitions, intrigues, and violent impulses, God’s divine hand overrules, shapes, and works through all political activities and outcomes to accomplish His purposes (Daniel 2:20, 21; 4:35). He can work even through ruthless and vain rulers as He pleases (cf. Proverbs 21:1). God doesn’t belong to any one nation, political party, or candidate. He is the “King of Kings and Lord of Lords” (Philippians 2:9-11; 1 Timothy 6:15; Revelation 17:14; 19:16). That’s why, regardless of outcomes, He is the One who is ultimately and always in control.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE POWER OF IGNORANCE\n\nIgnorance in action is dangerous, especially if the ignorance is willful. Confucius states: “The hardest thing of all is to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there's no cat.” None is safe when power is in the hands of willful ignorance—i.e., when power is combined with wrong assumptions, half-truths, misrepresentations, bigotry, or conscientious stupidity, or when it is driven by fear, envy, or fanaticism. Alas, ignorance spreads because those who have it take pride in it and zealously share it with those who won't think. Whether political or religious, the power of ignorance is ignorance with power. “Prove all things; hold fast to that which is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE DARK MOMENTS OF LIFE\n\nWithout the dark we cannot clearly see the stars. Similarly, the dark moments of adversity often reveal some of life’s most valuable gifts or blessings. What initially comes disguised as painful experiences are often used by God to deepen our spiritual walk and outlook on life. Fyodor Dostoyevsky said it best: “The darker the night, the brighter the stars; the deeper the grief, the closer is God!” Are you wondering about the dark moments in your life? Read the Book of Job, then take comfort in these words by Wintley Phipps: “It is in the quiet crucible of your personal, private sufferings that your noblest dreams are born and God’s greatest gifts are given in compensation for what you’ve been through.”—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nINTENT PRECEDES CONTENT\n\nWhen it comes to knowing God's plan for our lives, our intent to obey determines whether or not He will reveal the content to us. Why should He disclose who we should marry, career to pursue, truth to follow, or the what, when, & how of a duty to perform, when we have no intention of obeying, or are flouting things He’s already clearly revealed in His Word? Christ’s statement in another context equally applies: “Anyone who wants to do the will of God [INTENT] will know whether my teaching is from God or is merely my own [CONTENT]” (John 7:17; NLT). Are you seeking to know God’s will—e.g., an action to take, a choice to make, a journey to undertake, a relationship to forsake or break, etc.? Rest assured, clarity & certainty will come when we commit ahead of time to obeying Him. Intent precedes content (Proverbs 3:3-5).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE COST OF IGNORANCE\n\nNot knowing what we should know can be costly. Ali A. Mufuruki tells what took place in his home country of Tanzania during the colonial era: Some native Africans were using big rough stones to play a local board game. A Canadian geologist, Dr. John Williamson, who knew the stones, sent scouts to nearby villages to buy them for small fees and trinkets. He also got the local chief to sell him the land in the area and quickly secured an exclusive diamond-mining license. “Over its lifetime, the [Mwadui] mine has produced over 19 million carats (3,800 kg) of diamonds worth several times the GDP of my country today and has gone down in history as one of the oldest continuously operating diamond mine in the world” (Mufuruki). “My people perish for lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6). Africa, do you know?—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nA GOOD NAME\n\nCharacter outlasts reputation. Reputation is the celebrity we admire in the mirror. Character is the person who follows us everywhere. Reputation is our public image—what we want others to think. Character is our secret actions, words, thoughts, and motives—what we really are. Mathematically speaking, reputation is character minus the flaws we try to hide. We often mar our character by protecting our reputation, but God builds our character by smashing our reputation. Let’s allow God to transform our character, for when character is developed, reputation takes care of itself. Do you want a good name? Don’t fall for reputation; stand for character (Proverbs 22:1; Ecclessiastes 7:1).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nEAGLES IN CHICKENLAND\n\nWhen Eagles are silent, noise is equated with wisdom, propaganda with truth, and activity with productivity. Regrettably, Eagles in Chickenland are often silent because: they’re tired or feel it’s no use; their voices have been banned; they’re nursing their wounds (whether self-inflicted or by friendly-fire, opportunists, or vicious enemies); they feel it’s not safe (the air, water, & food have been poisoned, & many snares have been laid to entrap them); they’re waiting for a better time. But the cause is too great for Eagles to remain silent! Noise and propaganda will be minimized when knowledge and truth are disseminated, and mindless activity will be exposed when effective and sound efforts are evidenced by their fruits. Eagles must not be silent! They must speak NOW—through their words, actions, and sacrificial service (2 Timothy 4:2-5; Matthew 7:16)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nLET’S BE REAL!\n\nThe Hindu philosopher, Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948), once said of Christians: “I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians.” He also remarked: “Oh, I don't reject Christ. I love Christ. It's just that so many of you Christians are so unlike Christ. If Christians would really live according to the teachings of Christ, as found in the Bible, all of India would be Christian today.” How true for the entire world! Christ’s actions synced with His words. “What Christ taught, He lived.... And more than this; what He taught, He was. His words were the expression, not only of His own life experience, but of His own character. Not only did He teach the truth, but He was the truth. It was this that gave His teaching, power” (E.G. White). Want credibility? It’s not what we say, it’s what we do—and are. Let’s be real! (John 13:15; Matthew 5-7.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nPLAN AHEAD!\n\n“A mother bird does not begin building her nest on the day she’s in labor.” This Nigerian proverb restates Confucius: “A man who does not plan long ahead will find trouble at his door.” Every great thing requires a plan and good planning, a goal (where we want to go) and concrete strategies (how to get there). Even an omniscient God plans. He had a plan for Creation, a plan of salvation, and a plan for our lives (Genesis 1 & 2; Galatians 4:4; 1 Peter 1:18-21; Ephesians 2:10; Jeremiah 29:11). To fail to plan, is to plan to fail. It’s “like leaping off a precipice & trying to knit yourself a parachute on the way down” (Kelli Jae Baeli). Plan ahead! Like the mother bird, build your nest before your labor pains begin.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nLISTEN WITH YOUR TWO EARS\n\nThose who make decisions without listening to both sides of an issue are foolish and dangerous. Often, their judgments are unfair, and their actions encourage gossip and slander. God gave us two ears so we can hear things from ALL directions. One ear would only allow us to determine that a sound exists, but two ears allow us to know where a sound is coming from. Listening with two ears means we must listen to both sides; and must make no hasty judgments. Solomon said: “To answer before listening—that is folly and shame. …[For] the first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and questions him” (Proverbs 18:13, 17; NIV; cf. James 1:19, 20). There are two sides to every issue. Therefore, listen with your two ears.–Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nOLYMPIC GOLD\n\nA nation can be rich in gold, but destitute in Olympic gold. For example, to date, there’s been only one Olympic gold medal winner ever for my home country Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast). Only one! This is a nation where people love to adorn themselves in gold, where one can still find gold nuggets on the ground, and where the symbols of gold and excellence are made prominent in the national flag. But wearing an Olympic gold medal is not a fashion statement, nor a mark of wealth. Rather, it’s a tribute to an athlete’s hard work, determination, learning from failure, & self-discipline. It’s also a testament to a nation's investments in its human potentials. In life, as in the Olympics, those who pay the price win the prize. Be a champion. Don’t just compete, go for gold (1 Corinthians. 9:24-27).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nOUR WORDS\n\nOur words are bigger than our mouths, travel faster than light and outlast our time. Words can discourage or inspire, wound or heal, build up or tear down. An unknown poet wrote: “A careless word may kindle strife; A cruel word may wreck a life/ A bitter word may hate instill; A brutal word may smite and kill/ A gracious word may smooth the way; A joyous word may light the day/ A timely word may lessen stress; A loving word may heal and bless.\" Solomon said it best: “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit” (Proverbs 18:21). Someone near you is fighting life’s battles at great odds. Look out for that person today. Instead of harsh words, speak words of comfort and encouragement to inspire them with hope.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE NAKED EMPEROR\n\n“Propaganda does not deceive people; it merely helps them to deceive themselves” (Eric Hoffer). Two con artists convinced an emperor that they could make him the best suit from the finest cloth. The cloth would be invisible to anyone who was either stupid or unfit for his position. At a parade, no one admitted they couldn’t see the new suit he wore. So, they all praised it, until a little child exclaimed, “The emperor has nothing on!” That naked emperor is us. Willfully deceived, we choose friends, news sources, political parties, preachers, and even religions to tell us what we want to hear. The naked emperor needs the naked truth, not a propaganda outfit (2 Timothy 4:3, 4; Revelation 3:18).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nHISTORY’S VOLCANIC HOUR\n\nOnce, a US Senate Chaplain prayed: “Our Father God, …. in this volcanic hour of history save us, we beseech Thee, from panic and despair” (Frederick Brown Harris). Those words capture our inner fears and longings in today’s frightening world of uncertainties: Terrorism, unpredictable political upheavals, economic turbulence, convulsive natural calamities, religious mutations and realignments, obliteration of moral and ethical boundaries, massive corruption, explosive racial tensions, unprecedented lawlessness, violence and bloodshed. There’s the feeling globally that everything is in turmoil, that nothing is normal anymore, and that no one is really in charge. Never has there been valid reason for the feeling that something unpredictable and ominous is about to happen. Is there any help for history’s volcanic hour? Jesus said: \"Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near” (Luke 21:25-28).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nOUR TEARS\n\n“The sea is nothing but a library of all the tears in history” (Lemony Snicket). Each tear is written in a language that cannot be expressed in words. And every salty tear meandering into the sea is a cry for answers and a plea for help. Our bitter tears gush from many sources: From sorrow and pain, hate and hurt, betrayal and disappointment, rejection and loss, regret and failure. But it’s assuring that there’s One who has experienced our tears, who knows and keeps count of our individual tears, and who will soon bring all tears to an end (Hebrews 5:7; Psalm 56:8; Revelation 21:4). Until then, let each tear around us initiate the zeal to relieve or remove its cause, lest others drown in the flow of despised tears.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nOXYMORONS\n\nI’m pretty sure this nugget will be clearly misunderstood! If you missed it, I just used an oxymoron (“clearly misunderstood”)—a combination of contradictory or incongruous words. Unless used for dramatic effect or to add flavor to a speech, oxymorons make no logical sense. For example: definite maybe, pretty ugly, original copy, exact estimate, half pregnant, negative growth, all alone, living dead, found missing, (and in recent times) his husband or her wife. Religious and political oxymorons include: unbelieving faith, kosher pork, unforgiving Christian, Sunday Sabbath, Christian Yoga, rules of war, African democracy, United Nations. Can you think of more? \"Let your yea be yea…” (Matthew 5:37; James 5:12) or yours is a truthful lie.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nFORTUNES OF MISFORTUNE\n\nAlas, how often we show ingratitude for the gifts of misfortune! How frequently we display little appreciation for sorrow, disappointment, and failure! Wrapped in darkness, delivered with suddenness, and often greeted by disbelief, misfortunes are the fortunes that can easily be missed by the proud, careless, and ungrateful. Yet, through them we acquire wisdom, sympathy, humility, and a healthy dependence on God. The gifts of misfortune won't always be appreciated, but can be converted to meet our needs. Tomorrow’s fortunes are enveloped in today’s misfortunes. Let’s redeem this hidden wealth by developing attitudes of gratitude for life’s vicissitudes (Philippians 4:4-7; 1 Thessalonians 5:17, 18).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWHERE ARE THE MEN?\n\nFather’s Day honors not only biological fathers, but all men who act as father-figures in our lives—stepdads, uncles, grandpas, husbands, teachers and other responsible adult males. The day isn’t for hollow hilarity, but for sober reflection and honest introspection. It’s an occasion to celebrate the real men, the ones formed of steel, though coated in clay. It’s also a day to spotlight the reality of RECKLESS men—immature, lazy, inept, selfish, arrogant, and unspiritual men—who have thereby created RESTLESS women and ZESTLESS children. A time to echo God’s haunting question from Eden: “Adam, where are you?” (Genesis 3:9). And to swell the jarring refrain from today's women: “Where are the men?”—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nFrom MOURNING To MORNING\n\nWhat a week it has been! The world has been mourning the deaths of some notables: Sandwiched between the funerals of three-time world boxing legend Muhammad Ali (Friday, June 10) and that of respected, international evangelist Pastor CD Brooks (Sunday, June 12), was the massacre in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, of people from different backgrounds (Saturday night, June 11). Death has no preference. Death does not discriminate. And Death is no respecter of religion, race, nationality, status, age, gender, or sexual preference. Death alone has power to summon the expression of our basic humanness and to query us about fundamental issues of life, truth, morality, and our mortality. The Christian is comforted that THERE IS COMING A DAY when “God will wipe away every tear from our eyes; there’ll be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying…nor pain” (Revelation 21:4, 5; cf. 1 Thessalonnians 4:16-18). Then, it will be MORNING, NOT MOURNING! What a glorious day that will be!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\n[PS. This special weekend nugget was posted on Sabbath, June 18. It was my personal reflection on the notable deaths above, and their potential impact—globally—on human relations, and on discussions dealing with eternal verities. To wish my readers a \"Happy Sabbath,\" I shared with them the beautiful music, titled “WHAT A DAY THAT WILL BE” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycz4s2xwDhc). You also will be richly blessed.—SKP]\n\nTHE ROUGH MOUNTAINS\n\nThere are no smooth mountains. If our mountains were smooth, they would be difficult to climb. So, when God gives us mountains to climb, He leaves them rough. The bumps and rocks along the way—the obstacles and hurdles in our path—are actually stepping stones in our mountain climb. Thank God for your rough mountains—your trials and afflictions, your temptations and setbacks, your disappointments and sorrows. Without these jagged sides of life, there'll be no maturity and growth, nor mountaintop experiences. Faith climbs rough mountains. Therefore, welcome your struggles and challenges. By faith, Caleb said: “Give me the mountain” (Joshua 14:12). May we dare to say: “Give me my ROUGH mountain.”—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nBEING A CHAMPION\n\nHis words sting like a bee! “I’ve wrestled with alligators; I’ve tussled with a whale; I done handcuffed lightning and thrown thunder in jail….I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick… I make medicine sick.\" (Muhammad Ali). Ali’s greatness went beyond beyond the boxing ring. His legacy also includes his courage of convictions, his life of service, and his empowerment of others to fight for a cause (cf. 2 Timothy 4:7). Hear some of his words: \"Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion.” \"It isn't the mountains ahead that wear you down. It's the pebble in your shoe.” \"In a competition of love we'll all share in the victory, no matter who comes first.\" Do you want to be a champion in your sphere? Hear him: \"The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.” And, should you suffer defeat in life, “the only thing is to do it right.”—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nLET'S THINK!\n\nIt’s easier to feel than to think. And many who think they’re thinking are either parroting the thoughts of others or merely re-arranging their prejudices. Thinking is hard as it forces us to analyze facts before we finalize acts. Also, conclusions based on thinking are not always pleasant. But we must think! Whenever we abdicate our ability to think, or replace it with some superficial, emotional experience, we are in danger of being deceived, deluded, or unwittingly inflicting harm on others. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.” Let’s learn to think! Which is why Jesus repeatedly asked, “What do you think?” (cf. Matthew 18:12; 21:28; 22:17.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nDETERMINED LOVE\n\n“You can ignore Him days without number. You can reject Him. You can deny that He exists. You can mock and ridicule and curse Him. You can claim His name but play the Devil’s game. You can be ashamed of Him. You can hate Him bitterly. You can run away from Him. You can pledge your allegiance to His greatest enemy. You can squander on your own gratification all His gifts to you. You can defy Him. You can portray Him to others as severe and ruthless and uncaring. You can shut Him totally out of your life. You can blame Him for all the evil in your world.... But one thing you can never do. You can never make Him stop loving you. Never” (Ken McFarland). “Can a woman forget her nursing child, And not have compassion on the son of her womb? Surely they may forget, Yet I will not forget you (Isaiah 49:15). You can’t stop God from loving you!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nCHICKEN LEADERSHIP\n\nAlas, today we’ve allowed the chickens to lead the eagles! We know this when consciences don't catch fire for noble and just causes. When competence is determined by age, degrees, pedigree, and blind agreement. When activity counts, and not productivity. When self-interest and greed reign supreme. We know chickens are in charge when emotions trump common sense, fears melt courage, and the clamor of ignorant, dysfunctional, and self-seeking vigilantes usurp principled decisions. Tragically, in much of society and church, our deluded chickens convince themselves that they’re actually eagles, and parade their clueless, spineless, mediocre, & erratic leadership as administrative savvy. The audacity of chicken leadership! Where are the eagles? (Jeremiah 5:1; Ezekiel 22:30).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nSTAND UP & BE COUNTED\n\n“The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will not be bought or sold; men who in their inmost souls are true and honest; men who do not fear to call sin by its right name; men whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the [magnetic] pole; men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall” (E.G. White The world is indebted to people who prize character over reputation. Whose only fear is the fear of the Lord and the fear of sin. And who value principle over possessions, power, or pleasure. Such people unequivocally say “No,” when the rest of the world says “Yes.” With Joshua, they take a stand and declare publicly: “BUT AS FOR ME....” (Joshua 24:15). Now is our time. Stand up. Stand out. Stand tall.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nPERPLEXITIES & CONFUSION\n\nLike Peter, there are things we often don’t understand. On one occasion, Jesus responded: “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will know after this” (John 13:7). Writes E.G. White: “All that has perplexed us in the providences of God will in the world to come be made plain. The things hard to be understood will then find explanation. The mysteries of GRACE will unfold before us. Where our finite minds discovered only confusion and broken promises, we shall see the most perfect and beautiful harmony. We shall know that infinite LOVE ordered the experiences that seemed most trying. As we realize the tender care of Him who makes all things work together for our good, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.” Hallelujah!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nWHAT IS IT?\n\nI’m still pondering the question: “I’m sure you’ve had your share of lonely moments and tears…. But in looking back over your life, what is it that has defined who you are today and what is it that keeps you going?” I can't give an adequate answer, as my life is still unfolding. Certainly, life is made up of our choices and actions. And on further reflection, I believe we’re also defined by seemingly meaningless and painful circumstances. Even regretful moments of sorrow, loss, hurt, and despair have often been used by divine providence to define who we are now. To keep going, embrace your identity and destiny in Christ: “For I am the least… who am not worthy…. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain…. (1 Corinthians 15:9, 10). Take some time to reflect, and then answer the question: What is it about you?—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nITCHING EARS\n\nAn ancient Hebrew prayer says, \"From the conscience that shrinks from new truth, from the laziness that is content with half truths, from the arrogance that thinks it knows all truth, O God of truth deliver us.\" We can’t stand the truth, so we heap for ourselves people to tell us what we want to hear. We read and cite works that agree with our prejudices. And we choose friends, politicians, and preachers to tickle us with versions we resonate with. The Good Book describes us in our self-deception: Because of our “own desires” and “itching ears” we willfully “turn our ears away from the truth to fables” (2 Timothy 4:3, 4). Truth still matters. May the God of truth deliver us from our itching ears!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE LAST LAUGH\n\nHis first public announcement after the Resurrection was just one word: “REJOICE!” (Matthew 28:9). Interestingly, the same root word in Greek (“chairo”) was used by Judas in his kiss of betrayal, and by the soldiers to mock Him (26:49; 27:29). Christ’s enemies rejoiced that they had finished Him, that His cause was dead, and His followers, crushed. But, No! He rose! His one-word announcement, “REJOICE,” was His clear answer to sorrow on account of betrayal, injustice, humiliation, hate, and hurt. Good is stronger than evil, and truth, mightier than falsehood. In the Upper Room, He promised: “You will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice (chairo); and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy (chairo)” (John 16:20; cf. 22). Yes, the fortunes will be reversed! Sorrow will bow, and you’ll have the last laugh! Rejoice!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nARE YOU THERE?\n\nThe safest place to be is where God wants you to be. That place is your “there.” It describes your reality. “THERE” can be a physical location (e.g., a place to work, study, or live) or it can be a particular time to take an action. THERE can also be a dream or career to pursue, a relationship to engage in, or even a spiritual experience to have. To be THERE is to do or to live in God’s will, however perplexing. As long as you’re THERE, God will provide for you, protect you, and bless you (cf. 1 Kings 17:4, 9, 10). The real question, then, is: Are you THERE? If not, make every effort to be THERE. And if you’re already there, determine to patiently stay THERE. For, THERE is the soul’s place of quietness and peace.–Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nBEING STILL\n\nThere are increasingly fewer moments to just be quiet and reflect. Ambient noise has become part of our lives—noise from traffic, airplanes, radio, TV, friends, churches, and even personal computers and phones. But if we learn to block out the noises, we shall discover some majestic truths about our Creator and the universe. We’ll also discover some ugly truths about ourselves—our fears and unbeliefs, our self-importance and self-righteousness, our falsehoods and hypocrisy. The Bible bids us to “be still and know that I am God” (Psalm 46:10). It’s an invitation to quietly reflect and trustfully depend on God. Being still is often the moment God leads us to brokenness. Steal away and be still—to reflect, to pray, and to be.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nAFRICA OWNS TIME\n\nOthers keep time, but Africans own time—the African time. This is why Black people have a tendency to be late to programs or functions. Tardiness seems to be in our Black genes. Unpunctuality has almost become the trademark of all Africans—whether on the continent or in the Diaspora. Even among Christians, lateness has been converted into a ubiquitous spiritual gift. Let Africa remember that, those who disrespect time are severely punished by life. For life is made up of time.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\n(For more, read my short piece titled “Africa Has Time” on the link below: http://eaglesonline.org/africa-has-time/)\n\nDON’T HATE LOVE\n\n“Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable…. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like ‘maybe we should be just friends’ turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love” (Neil Gaiman). To avoid hating love, “do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires” (Song of Songs 2:7; 3:5; 8:4; NIV). Instead, first commit your heart to the One Who is “the Chiefest among ten thousand… Altogether lovely…my Beloved…my Friend” (5:10, 16; KJV). You can either hate love or love love. Love love by choosing Love. God is love (1 John 4:8, 16).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nFEAR NOT!\n\nIt is said that whenever God says, “Fear not,” you must start worrying; for He’ll be asking you to do the impossible! (Think of Abraham, Moses, Gideon, Jeremiah, or Mary). Yet, God's “Fear not” commands are also His promises. An estimated 365 “fear not” promises are in the Bible—at least one for each day’s need. Therefore, when it seems like you're finished or it’s over and there's no point going on, Jesus says “Fear not; it’s not the end, just the beginning.” (cf. Mark 5: 35, 36). \"The remarkable thing about God is that when you fear God, you fear nothing else, whereas if you do not fear God, you fear everything else” (Oswald Chambers). God has power to intervene, even in your most hopeless situations. Fear not!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTHE VALUE OF VALUES\n\nAre there unchangeable, universal moral values to guide human conduct? Today, “everything is relative,” including values. Moral relativism is the crisis of our times. The crisis is not the violation of morally-accepted standards of conduct (every age has had its share of this). Rather, the crisis is the questioning of the existence of universal moral values to define what’s right and wrong. But if “everything is relative,” then that statement itself is relative and, hence, self-refuting. Worse, “a world without values quickly becomes a world without value” (Jonathan Sacks). It’s why for our ethics we must value what God values. (Micah 6:8; Matthew 7:12; Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14; Exodus 20:1-3; Romans 2:14-15; James 2:8-13; John 14:15).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nGROW IN THE STORM\n\nCharacter develops in the storms—when trials and afflictions test our strength, stability, and resilience. The Apostle Paul lists some of the storms as tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword, and states emphatically that \"in all these things\"—i.e., in all these storms—\"we are MORE THAN CONQUERORS through Him who loved us\" (Romans 8:35, 37). So, when life seems hard to bear, when it’s full of sorrow, trouble, and woe, let’s remind ourselves that it's in these storms we grow. While thankful for the fragrant and gentle breezes in life, let’s not decry the pungent blasts of turbulent tides. Storms ought not to break you. You’re more than a conqueror. Grow—and BLOOM—in your storms (see, Proverbs 24:10).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nLEAVE A LEGACY\n\nNone was ever honored for breezing through life; they are remembered for weathering the storms. Do you seek to leave your mark? Then, find your calling and run with it. Don’t settle for the status quo, but put some quo in the status: “Risk more than others think is safe. Dream more than others think is practical. Expect more than others think is possible. Work more than others think is necessary” (Unknown). And when threatened or rewarded with stabs in the back, shackles on the feet, or shots to the heart, say with the Apostle Paul, “None of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, that I may finish my race with joy” (Acts 20:24). Brave the storm. Leave a legacy.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nJUMP IN!\n\nSuccess begins when you start. An old riddle illustrates: One hot afternoon, seven frogs sat on a log at the edge of a pond. To cool off, four decided to jump into the pond. How many frogs were left on the log? The answer is seven. Why? The four only “decided” to jump. And there’s a big difference between merely deciding and actually doing. Here’s the point: Dreams, intentions, resolutions, and even best plans are not worth much, unless we act on them. Act upon your decisions—whether in your personal, professional, or spiritual life! Don't wait till all doubts, uncertainties, and obstacles have been removed. The best way to start is to start. Without action, a dream is a daydream (Matthew 21:28-32). Jump off the log now!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR!?\n\n“Happy New Year” is an overrated phrase, if not, sometimes, a meaningless wish. 1) How can we wish it to anyone when HAPPINESS means different things to different people? 2) What is really NEW about the year? Chances are we’re going to live and do the same old things. The new YEAR is only new when there’s a new PERSON—one with a new spirit and a new set of values. “Happy New Year” should not be a wish; it must be a will. Not a change on a calendar date, but a change from within. Not a new year, but a new YOU! “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17; Matthew 5:1-10). Is it \"Happy New Year!\" yet for you?—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nON LOOKING BACK\n\n“We ought not to look back, unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors and for the purpose of profiting by dear-bought experience” (George Washington). Here’s how to benefit from regretful experiences of the past: Graciously accept your defeats; humbly admit your failures; willingly accept the consequences of your mistakes; ardently learn from your missteps; courageously ignore your adversaries and distractors; freely forgive those who have hurt you; freely forgive those who have hurt you; and fully surrender your hopes to God’s will. You cannot undo nor ignore the past. But you can make sure you don't repeat what you did or failed to do. Setbacks shouldn’t set you back. They are stepping-stones. Step on the stones and you’ll move upward and forward. Look back, but don’t dwell there. (Philippians 3:13, 14; Isaiah 43:18, 19.)—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nUNMERRY CHRISTMAS\n\nIf you think Christmas is all jingle bells, jollity, and unwrapping gifts…think again! To millions around the world, the festive season is full of pain, tears, and disillusionment. Thankfully, the Biblical accounts of Christ’s birth speak forcefully to the harsh realities of life, and even to the ubiquitous headline news: The massacre of the innocent (whether by sword, bullet, bombs, or suicide bombers), the floods of refugees seeking asylum in other countries, the plight of the homeless, the dilemma of couples contemplating breakups or divorce, the challenge of teenage pregnancies and adoption, and the struggles with poverty and guilt (Matthew 1:18-2:23; Luke 1& 2; Isaiah 9:6, 7). Christ’s birth whispers hope to the disheartened, for Jesus identifies with all for whom Christmas is UNMERRY. Unto us a Son is given: Counselor, Prince of Peace, Savior, and Emmanuel.—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim.\n\nOUR GREATEST NEED\n\nWhat is it? An unknown author has aptly stated: “If our greatest need had been information, God would have sent an educator. If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, God would have sent an economist. If our greatest need had been pleasure, God would have sent us an entertainer. But our greatest need was forgiveness, so He sent us a Savior.” So true! “For unto you is born this day in the city of David a SAVIOUR, which is Christ the Lord. …You shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.” Our greatest need is to experience the reality of being forgiven and forgiving (Luke 2:11; Matthew 1:21; cf. 1 John 1:9; Ephesians 4:31, 32; Colossians 3:12, 13).—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nTELL YOUR STORY\n\nYou have a story to tell, and a duty to share it. It’s the story of what you’ve been through and of God’s mighty deliverances, providential leadings, and tender mercies in your life. Your story may not be pretty or exciting, but even an ugly & painful story needs to be told to instruct, warn, and encourage others. Your story today may not be complete, for you still have struggles and battles. Still, tell the unfolding story of what God is doing in your life. For, amazingly, your story is part of God’s Big Story—the story of His saving grace and love, and of His power to turn what was meant for evil to your good. Never be afraid nor ashamed to tell your story. Like the healed demoniac, go to others and “tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you” (Mark 5:19; Luke 8:39; Genesis 50:20). Tell your story to His glory!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nGIVING & RECEIVING\n\nWe say “we’re blessed” when we receive something. In fact, we’re MORE blessed when we give. Jesus said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive\" (Acts 20:35). This principle holds for individuals, organizations, businesses, and nations. To constantly receive and not give is to be selfish and impoverished. It’s why the Dead Sea is dead while the Jordan River is alive. “True generosity doesn’t start when you have some thing to give, but rather when there’s nothing in you that’s trying to take” (Nipun Mehta). Sacrificial GIVING—of our time, money, knowledge, sympathy, friendship, kindness, forgiveness, etc.—brings us a greater blessing than what we receive (Proverbs 11: 24-26; Psalm 41:1-3). Give selflessly and generously!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nBE THANKFUL\n\nAn elderly lady in a nursing home said, “I thank you, Lord, for two good teeth, one upper and one lower. And I thank you that they meet!” Thankful for little things. Fanny Crosby (1820-1915) wrote more than 9,000 hymns during her lifetime. When she was just six weeks old, she became blind for life—due to a doctor’s incompetence. But despite her blindness, she refused to be bitter or feel sorry for herself. She explained why: “If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me.” Thankful for trials. There’s ALWAYS something to be thankful for (Philippians 4:6, 7; Psalm 103:1-5). Find yours!—Samuel Koranteng-Pipim\n\nA DEADLY DISEASE\n\nIt is the root-cause of every other ailment. It has brought restlessness, misery, and devastation to every family that ever existed anywhere in the universe. It has afflicted ordinary people, great leaders, and even holy angels. This cancer of the soul is best known as Pride or self-conceit. “The more we have it ourselves, the more we dislike it in others” (C.S. Lewis). It’s a deadly disease. To have it is to be delusional. To deny you have it is to be full of it and, thus, incurable. There’s only one lasting cure: Christ’s grace of humility. He Himself said, “learn from Me, for I am gentle & lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls” (Matthew 11:29; Proverbs 16:5, 18).—Samuel Koranteng-P"
