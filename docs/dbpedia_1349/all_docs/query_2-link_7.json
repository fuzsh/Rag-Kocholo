        "text": "Just like 'Prelude', I was feeling my way around as I wrote this piece since the world of FF was yet to be revealed. I had about four demos and by incorporating ideas from Mr Toriyama (the Director), I made one arrangement to another to form the piece. So I feel that Mr Toriyama and I wrote this together. At the end, we asked Mr. Toshiyuki Omori to turn it into orchestrated piece by adding harp to the intro piano part and also changing the outro sound from synthesizer to strings. He actually said that the synthesizer wasn't bad at all, but it was the first one to be played in the demo version and I insisted on the live instruments.\n\nMasashi Hamauzu\n\n\"FINAL FANTASY XIII - The Promise\" (FINAL FANTASY XIII ～誓い～, FINAL FANTASY XIII ~Chikai~?, lit. FINAL FANTASY XIII ~Oath~) is a prominent theme of Final Fantasy XIII, and is considered its main theme. It was composed by Masashi Hamauzu and arranged and orchestrated by Toshiyuki Oomori.\n\nGame appearances[]\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII[]\n\nAs the main theme, \"The Promise\" is heard several times. It has several arrangements and is also included in many tracks. The track itself is heard in-game at the title screen, and is the second track of the original soundtrack's first disc.\n\nA \"prototype\" version of the theme is included in the Final Fantasy XIII: Original Soundtrack PLUS.\n\nArrangements of \"The Promise\" include \"Serah's Theme\", the twenty-second track of the soundtrack's second disc, which is a vocal arrangement performed by Frances Maya used in several cutscenes involving Serah or her crystallized tear: it also replaces Eternal Love in the overseas versions. Another vocal arrangement is \"The Sunleth Waterscape\", which is the eponymous location's background theme and the sixteenth track of the second disc, and was also performed by Frances Maya.\n\n\"In the Sky that Night\" is another arrangement used for flashbacks of the Bodhum Fireworks Festival (with the sole exception of Hope's), and the fourteenth track of the soundtrack's first disc. Another prominent arrangement of \"The Promise\" is \"The Archylte Steppe\", the background theme for the eponymous location and the third track of the soundtrack's fourth disc. Finally, \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\", the sixteenth track of the soundtrack's fourth disc, which plays during the final cutscenes before the final battle.\n\n\"The Promise\"'s motif is also included in several other tracks, including \"Forever Fugitives\"; \"Glory's Fanfare\"; the background theme for the ending cutscene of the game, \"Determination\". \"FINAL FANTASY XIII -Miracles-\" includes the motif of \"The Promise\" at its conclusion, and is the seventeenth track of the soundtrack's fourth disc. The \"Ending Credits\" are an extended orchestral performance of \"The Promise\", and is the twenty-second track of the soundtrack's fourth disc.\n\nThe lyrics for \"Serah's Theme\" and \"The Sunleth Waterscape\" were revised for the English localization of Final Fantasy XIII (even though the original recordings were already in English) because of the opinion of the English-language staff that the lyrics needed to sound more natural to native speakers.[1]\n\nAn instrumental version of \"The Sunleth Waterscape\" has been released on the Final Fantasy XIII: Original Soundtrack PLUS album.\n\n\"The Sunleth Waterscape\" lyrics[]\n\nThe official lyrics for the Japanese version were released on the Final Fantasy XIII: Original Soundtrack.\n\nJapanese version[]\n\nStep into the rainbow, find another view\n\nChase the tender light, borders let's cross over\n\nReady to define the mists inside your heart?\n\nTake a breath and start your life\n\nWaves of a new day\n\nClear all the gloom away\n\nHope is what we simply need to proceed\n\nOverseas version[]\n\nStep into the rainbow, world you never knew\n\nChase the arcs of light, soar beyond your sorrows\n\nDance among the colors, let them be your dreams\n\nClose your eyes and see anew\n\nDawn of the new day\n\nClears all our gloom away\n\nThis is the hope that we need to go on\n\n\"Serah's Theme\" lyrics[]\n\nThe official lyrics for the Japanese version were released on the Final Fantasy XIII: Original Soundtrack.\n\nJapanese version[]\n\nMake my wish come true, let darkness slip aside\n\nHiding all our hope, mocking what we treasure\n\nBattles we can win, if we believe our souls\n\nHang in for the light, till dawn\n\nFate will not leave you, hate will not heal you\n\nPray and one day, peace shall flow everywhere\n\nOverseas version[]\n\nMake my wish come true, let darkness fade to light\n\nShow me there's still hope, show me it's not over\n\nBattles we can win, our struggle lies within\n\nWill we live to greet the dawn?\n\nLove will not leave you, hate will not heal you\n\nPromise me one day that peace shall reign\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2[]\n\n\"The Promise\" can be heard in some cutscenes, and the original \"Serah's Theme\" from Final Fantasy XIII makes several appearances as well due to the now protagonist nature of the character, for example when in New Bodhum, Serah tells Noel Kreiss about how Snow left her and started his search for Lightning, and in the Fate and Freedom paradox ending. \"The Promise\" was also used in the debut trailer for the game. \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" plays during the secret ending of Requiem of the Goddess downloadable content scenario.\n\n\"The Archylte Steppe\" acts as the background track for the Prologue in the Beginner's Primer and the Paddraean Archaeopolis area of Yaschas Massif 1X AF.\n\n\"Sunleth Waterscape\" returns as the backing track for Sunleth Waterscape 400 AF and the southern section of 300 AF. The original Japanese version are used in all localizations, and the overseas lyrics are not used at all in the game.\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII[]\n\n\"The Promise\" briefly reappears in the tracks \"Claire Farron\", \"Humanity's Tale\", and \"Credits ~ Light Eternal\".\n\nThe song itself appears in a story relevant role in the side quest, \"Play It for Me\". Lumina taught the song to a boy who plays part of it on his horn to attract Lightning's attention. He tells her to find supply spheres containing parts of the song and return them to him and he'll play the full song in exchange. After doing so, Lightning explains the significance of the song and its connection to herself and Snow; it was a favorite of Serah's who would often hum it. The boy promises he'll keep playing the song in case Snow should overhear. Lightning states the title of the song is \"Miracles\", though it doesn't match the actual song named such, instead matching \"The Promise\".\n\nIn Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Retro-spective trailer, the 16-bit version of the theme appears.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV[]\n\n\"FINAL FANTASY XIII - The Promise\" is the first track of the Memories of FFXIII, which is available by default in the music player.\n\nDissidia 012 Final Fantasy[]\n\n\"The Archylte Steppe\" from Final Fantasy XIII\n\n\"The Archylte Steppe -original- from FINAL FANTASY XIII\" appears as the overworld music for Lightning, and is the fifteenth track of the second disc of the Original Soundtrack.\n\n\"The Promise\" was also included in the medley of ending themes created for \"DISSIDIA 012[duodecim]-ending- from DISSIDIA 012[duodecim] FINAL FANTASY\", the twentieth track of the soundtrack's second disc. It is the last theme to play before the themes representing the two Dissidia titles.\n\nDissidia Final Fantasy (2015)[]\n\n\"Sunleth Waterscape\" is available from a Theatrhythm Final Fantasy event.\n\nDissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia[]\n\n\"The Promise\" plays in several cutscenes involving Lightning and Serah.\n\n\"Archylte Steppe\" plays on the map of Vanille's Lost Chapter The Girl from Oerba.\n\n\"Sunleth Waterscape\" plays on the map of Ch. 9: Utopia Niveus.\n\nTheatrhythm Final Fantasy[]\n\n\"The Promise\" and \"Sunleth Waterscape\" appear for the Final Fantasy XIII Series Mode as its Opening and Field music, respectively. \"Sunleth Waterscape\" is also one of two themes chosen for the downloadable 3DS eShop Demo.\n\n\"Archylte Steppe\" is a bonus Field Music Sequence theme available as downloadable content.\n\nAn arrangement of \"The Sunleth Waterscape\" plays as a quest medley BGM.\n\nTheatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call[]\n\n\"Sunleth Waterscape\" and \"Archylte Steppe\" reappear as Field Music Sequences for Final Fantasy XIII. The former also appears on the Best of Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call album.\n\nTheatrhythm Final Fantasy All-Star Carnival[]\n\n\"Sunleth Waterscape\" appears again as a playable Field Music Sequence. It is available to the player by default.\n\nDifficulty Beginner Basic Expert Ultimate Transcendent N/A 3 5 9 N/A\n\nFinal Fantasy Record Keeper[]\n\n\"FINAL FANTASY XIII - The Promise\" is included as part of the 7th anniversary medley.\n\nArrangement album appearances[]\n\nPiano Collections: Final Fantasy XIII[]\n\nA piano arrangement combining \"FINAL FANTASY XIII - The Promise\" with \"Sunleth Waterscape\" was included.
