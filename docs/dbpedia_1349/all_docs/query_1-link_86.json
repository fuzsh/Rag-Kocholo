        "text": "—plus some borderline cases:\n\nSometimes there's a fine line between \"tribute\" and \"parody.\" While there's almost always at least some element of tribute, if only backhandedly, in any parody, elements of parody can also appear in even the most heartfelt tributes. Perhaps the chief signifier is humor.\n\nBack in 1993, shortly before the release of Very, the Pet Shop Boys were interviewed in their \"Can You Forgive Her?\" guises on the BBC2 music show The O-Zone. The interviewer, Andi Peters, wore an orange shirt and \"dunce cap\" while interacting with them in the video's computer-generated otherworld. As a result, he seems to be \"semi-parodying\" them—at least as they appear in that video—although, more than anything else, it simply comes across as some good-natured fun to which the Boys had given their complete blessing. By the way, it's a delightful interview, which for the time being you can watch on YouTube.\n\nI've never really thought of the 2008 single \"Jizz in My Pants\" by Andy Samberg's comedy-music group The Lonely Island as a PSB parodyâit's too markedly different in style and (in the video) visualsâbut many nevertheless regard it as such. And, to be sure, the faux standard British accents adopted by Samberg and partner Jorma Taccone (both Americans) suggest that there's at least an element of PSB parody underpinning this silly bit of vulgarly juvenile humor. But the fact that it has two vocalist/rappers, not one, trading off their bits in a way that Neil and Chris have never done, as well as other stylistic dissimilarities, firmly places it in the \"borderline\" category, at least in my book.\n\nAlastair Douglas and Rhys Evans, collectively known as The MFA—which reportedly stands for \"Mother-F**king Allstars\"—are a U.K. synth duo of a younger generation. The Pet Shop Boys have clearly served as inspirations to them. The MFA have paid tribute in various ways, including their music video for \"Throw It Back (We Will Destroy You),\" which is very clearly an homage to the \"West End Girls\" video. (It perhaps, to a much lesser extent, draws upon the \"Love Comes Quickly\" and \"So Hard\" vids as well.) Although visually it covers similar ground as the Flight of the Conchords' \"Inner City Pressure,\" discussed above as an outright parody, the MFA song itself betrays no elements of PSB parody at all. That just leaves the video, which, at least to this observer, seems much too direct and affectionate to be called a \"parody\"—even if The MFA do have a reputation for being a bit \"daft.\"\n\nAll three members of the band Keane are professed PSB fans. In an extremely informal \"mini-doc\" that appeared both on the official Keane website and on YouTube in April 2009, lead singer Tom Chaplin does his off-camera vocal \"impression\" of Neil singing bits of \"Opportunities,\" \"Rent\" (getting the latter lyrics wrong), and—if you stick around until the very end and the screen has gone black—\"Always on My Mind.\" Frankly, I don't think he sounds much like Neil at all, but it certainly cracks up his bandmates. I guess you had to be there. It's an affectionate bit of goofing around, to be sure, though perhaps not elaborate enough to be considered a true \"parody.\"\n\nReportedly no longer active, the tribute band Pet Shop Noise clearly paid homage to the Boys, but from what I gather (I never saw nor heard them myself) overt humor wasn't a major aspect of their performances. So the term \"parody\" probably doesn't apply well to them.\n\nIn the same category I'd place a comparatively new tribute band (apparently starting around 2009) who call themselves—are you ready for this?—Pet Shop Boys Tribute Band, or just Pet Shop Boys Tribute for short. I'd have to say that they make up in accuracy what they may lack in imagination. At least I've been able to find a picture of them—something I'd never been able to do for Pet Shop Noise. From what I've heard of them (on YouTube), they do a more than passable job of replicating the \"PSB sound.\"\n\nAnd then there's the case of Isabelle and Rosanna, the West End Girlsa Swedish female duo who (at least to date) perform nothing but PSB covers, pattern themselves after Neil and Chris, and have adopted PSB iconography lock, stock, and tongue-in-cheek barrel. The transposition of \"PSB semiotics\" to women strongly suggests an inherently funny form of \"faux drag,\" made all the more humorous by the intently straight-faced demeanor of the Girls in question, the occasional tongue-sticking-out-of-cheek notwithstanding. So is it tribute or parody? No law says that it can't be both. If you're interested, their debut album, Goes Petshopping (retitled We Love Pet Shop Boys in the U.S.), was released in June 2006. And it's not bad at all.\n\nIt wasn't really a parody, and it was of only half of PSB, but I'd truly hate myself if I didn't mention TV writer Andy McNally's impersonation of Neil Tennant on a 1999 episode of the British TV show Stars in Their Eyes. Frankly, I don't think he actually looked or sounded much at all like Neil, but he had the costuming—borrowed from the final numbers of the Boys' classic Performance show—fabulously down pat. And, to his credit, I think his heart was in the right place. That is, he appears to display genuine affection for the subject of his impersonation. And apparently this wasn't the first time someone had paid tribute to Neil on Stars in the Eyes. One Adrian Pye reportedly appeared in the role of Neil singing \"Go West\" on a 1995 episode. I don't have any photos of his performance, however.\n\nThe October 22, 2015 edition of the Sky 1 TV show Bring the Noise featured a guest appearance by former Doctor Who actor David Tennant, well known among his fellow PSB fans for having borrowed his stage surname from Neil. He paid further tribute to the Boys by teaming up with English rapper Tinie Tempah and Canadian actress-comedian Katherine Ryan for a comic rendition of \"West End Girls.\" It didn't seem so much a parody of the Pet Shop Boys themselves as a parody of a performance of that particular song, if that makes sense. But it still deserves a mention here.\n\nAnother quasi-parody/tribute occurred on the 1990s German television show Mini Playback, a weekly competition that featured children mimicking pop music stars and lipsynching to their music. The Pet Shop Boys were of course ripe for this sort of treatment. And, sure enough, one episode in December 1994 saw a couple of youngsters assume the costumed roles of Chris and Neil, accompanied by an equally \"mini\" black Statue of Liberty and, far more inexplicably, a cadre of dancing kids dressed in American football uniforms.\n\nThe April 4, 2021 edition of the Russian television show Ð¢Ð¾ÑÑ-Ð²-ÑÐ¾ÑÑ (meaning \"Exactly the Same\"), which is based on the American 2013â14 TV show Sing Your Face Off, included a tribute/parody rendition of \"It's a Sin\" starring Russian pop singer Mitya Fomin in the role of Neil. (Fomin, very much a PSB fan, had previously in 2013 recorded a \"quasi-cover\" of \"Paninaro '95\" titled \"Paninaro 2011 (ÐÐ³Ð½Ð¸ Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð³Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð´Ð°).\")\n\nIn January 2014 the Italian sports/entertainment TV show Quelli che... il Calcio (\"Those Whoâ¦ Enjoy Football\") featured an execrably bad parodyâin fact, I'm not even sure it merits that desgination, which is why I'm listing it here among the questionable \"also-rans\"âagain based on and miming to \"Go West,\" only this time performed (and I use that word loosely) by adults. (What's up with the twenty-plus-year-old pop culture references?) It's so lame that I must assume it was meant to be \"so bad that it's good.\" But, if that's the case, I don't believe they're very successful even in that. Maybe it was more amusing for the live studio audience, many of whom indeed seemed amusedâthough, to be sure, many others simply appeared bewildered.\n\nI'm not sure it actually qualifies (is it really a \"PSB performance parody?\"), but I nevertheless feel obliged to mention the \"Go East\" recording and video created by the staff of the Edinburgh Evening News to celebrate the 2012 all-Edinburgh Scottish Cup Finals (football/soccer). True, the video has little if anything to do with the Boysâunless you regard the two dancing pandas as their stand-insâbut the music is indisputably done in the style of their classic rendition of \"Go West,\" which itself has long been a staple at U.K. sporting events.\n\nVirtually everybody who has ever written about \"The Hairstyle of the Devil\" by the Scottish artist Momus (né Nicholas Currie; friends call him Nick), from his 1989 album Don't Stop the Night, has observed its unmistakable Pet Shop Boyishness. Momus appears, in fact, to be very much a PSB fan, having contributed his cover of \"So Hard\" to the 2001 tribute album Very Introspective, Actually and writing or talking about them on various occasions. He even sampled them in his 1988 track \"A Complete History of Sexual Jealousy (Parts 17–24).\" So \"The Hairstyle of the Devil\" may not actually be a PSB parody or even a PSB tribute, but its PSB stylistic verisimilitude is so profound that it must be a PSB something. And from my perspective that makes it, at the very least, a borderline case well worth mentioning here. Oh, did I mention that it's an absolutely fantastic track?\n\nFinally, there's the unique tale of British songwriter and producer Jonathan King's 1987 remake of Cat Stevens's \"Wild World\" in the style of the Pet Shop Boys' \"It's a Sin.\" King's point wasn't so much to parody PSB as to support his repeated public contention that Tennant and Lowe had plagiarized the melody of the Stevens song. To further his point, the single's cover art parodied the cover of Actually (with a \"constructed\" image of King himself and Stevens substituting for Chris and Neil) and featured the words \"actually, It's a sinto steal.\" (King also offered a bit of guilt-by-association evidence in the form of the b-side: the old Chiffons hit \"He's So Fine\" performed in the style of George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord.\" These two songs had been at the center of a notorious legal case more than a decade before, in which Harrison had been found guilty of unintentionally plagiarizing the older song.) At any rate, the Boys sued King and The Sun, which had published King's allegations. The case was settled out of court to the Boys' advantage, and they donated the undisclosed sum awarded them to charity. All this aside, although parody may not have been the objective, it was, in essence, a side-effect.*\n\n*By the way, in case you're wondering whether I believe King's allegations had any merit, let me put it like this. His rendition of \"Wild World\" à la \"It's a Sin\" underscores both the similarities and the differences of the two melodies. That is, yes, they're similarthere's no getting around it. But they're also sufficiently different to completely absolve Neil and Chris of plagiarism. In fact, I believe that King's quasi-parody, if anything, truly weakened his case. And in case you're also wondering, the composer of \"Wild World\" himself remained publicly silent and neutral during the entire affair, although Neil has stated, \"Yusuf Islam [the former Cat Stevens] wrote us a very charming letter offering to mediate at one point.\" Years later, King himself would maintain that he never actually accused the Boys of \"stealing\" anything, which sounds to me like an attempt at historical revisionism, albeit perhaps an understandable one. After all, at the very start of King's \"Wild World\" recording in the style of \"It's a Sin,\" a voice repeatedly intones, \"You're not getting away with it.\" Getting away with what, pray tell? Of course there was that statement right there on the cover, \"actually, it's a sin—to steal.\""
