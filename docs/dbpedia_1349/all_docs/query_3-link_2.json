        "text": "Early life[]\n\nMy dad said you should never break a promise, no matter how small.\n\nHope to Kai and Elida\n\nWhen Hope was eight years old, he and his close friends Kai and Elida Karmic went on a school field trip to the Sunleth Waterscape with Sazh Katzroy as their airship pilot. Hope's class took pictures with their toy cameras as they learned about the scenery and wildlife and returned to a lake's shore for lunch.\n\nWhen Kai wanted to take a picture for his younger brother Hal, he realized he dropped his camera on a closed path. The trio slipped past the researchers cleaning up the main route but got lost. Following advice from his father, Hope used a sharp rock to mark a boulder as their starting position.\n\nThey found a machine panel that Elida activated. After failing to use it and call for help, the trio continued and came across a climate control orb. Elida touched it against Kai and Hope's protests, triggering a rainfall. They sought shelter in a rock tunnel, but Hope recalled a researcher saying certain monsters enjoy the rain. He made a run for the orb, but several Mud Frogs and Hedge Frogs advanced towards them. The monsters turned away as someone stopped the rain.\n\nThanks to Elida tampering with the panel, their airship found them, and Kai's camera was returned to him, as a researcher had found it. Hope regretted suggesting to look for it and wanted to apologize to Kai, but Kai enjoyed the misadventure. Hope fell ill and visited the emergency room after returning to Palumpolum. Three days later, Kai and Elida told Hope about Sazh, whose son was born a short while ago.\n\nWhen Hope was 11, Kai's family moved, and he went to a new school, so Hope barely spoke to him since. Elida dreamed of becoming a singer and went to an all-girls school with a special music program at age 13. As for Hope, he aspired to be like his dad.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII Episode Zero -Promise-[]\n\nMom... You still believe in that kind of stuff? Wishing on fireworks? Really? That's for little kids.\n\nHope to Nora\n\nDuring time off from school, a 14-year-old Hope and his mother Nora were on a ten-day vacation in Bodhum to see the annual fireworks show. Nora hoped to use the break to heal the rift between Hope and his father, Bartholomew. After checking into their beach resort condo, Hope and Nora visited the shopping mall. As they looked at chocobo chicks in a pet shop, they unknowingly inspired Lightning to plan a vacation away from Bodhum for her birthday to spend time with her sister Serah.\n\nIn the evening, five days later, Bartholomew called to tell her an urgent business trip came up but promised to join his family in time for the festival. Hope doubted it since his father often neglected him and Nora for his job. Nora wanted to visit Euride as planned since the cleanup operation after the accident three days ago had ended, explaining there's nothing Bartholomew can do about being held up at work since the Euride incident affected his job. Seeing that Nora was getting upset, Hope changed the subject and helped her wash the vegetables she got from Yuj, Maqui, and Lebreau. When Hope called Nora shameless for getting the vegetables for free, she laughed that she's a tough mother.\n\nThey visited Euride Gorge the next day, but the plaza was closed off and full of PSICOM soldiers. Hope reminisced about his school trip six years ago and what Bartholomew said about keeping promises; it's something Hope believes his dad no longer does, and he no longer wants to be like him. After Hope and Nora visited the fal'Cie Kujata, they returned to the entrance and heard passersby mention a boy was injured in the accident. Nora hoped for the child's survival since there's nothing worse than a child dying before their parent; Hope thought it's still sad for those left behind regardless of who dies first. Nora asked if Hope hates his father and lamented Bartholomew isn't good at \"these kinds of things\", but many in the Sanctum count on him, and he wants to do a good job. Hope assured Nora he's not mad since Bartholomew will join them for the fireworks. Hope considered talking to his dad on the night of the festival to make Nora happy and thought about reconnecting with Kai and Elida when he returns home.\n\nTwo days later, Bartholomew missed the fireworks festival. Nora made a wish, and Hope laughed at her insistence on the gesture since he believed it's for kids. Disappointed that Nora wished for his father to join them next year, Hope said they're better off without him. Unbeknownst to them, that night, PSICOM discovered the Pulse fal'Cie Anima within the Pulse Vestige.\n\nThe Sanctum announced the discovery the next day, and the town was quarantined, trapping Hope and Nora. A frantic Nora begged a PSICOM soldier at the train station to let Hope return home alone, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. They were sentenced to be Purged to Gran Pulse—the hellish world beneath Cocoon—along with everyone else in Bodhum and forced to spend the night in the barricaded town. As they queued for the Purge train in the station the following day, a girl named Vanille bumped into Nora. The two talked until Nora stopped to tend to the silent and distressed Hope. Nora's kindness made Vanille decide to accompany the two.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII[]\n\nAnd what if that gets people around you involved? What happens when your actions end up ruining someone's life? What if someone dies? What then, Snow? How do you pay for what you've done?\n\nHope to Snow\n\nWhen the Purge train enters the Hanging Edge, Lightning, a former Guardian Corps soldier, and her ally of circumstance, Sazh, hijack it. Hope, Nora, Vanille, and the rest of the Purgees escape to a skybridge, rescued by the resistance group NORA and their leader Snow Villiers, who wish to stop the Purge. Some Purgees choose to fight alongside them, including Nora. From afar, Vanille and Hope watch PSICOM destroy the bridge with Nora and the other volunteers, and Nora fall to her death after saving Snow's life. Hope blames Snow for his mother's death, so Vanille encourages him to approach Snow, but Hope hesitates long enough for Snow to leave for the Pulse Vestige that PSICOM has transported to the Hanging Edge.\n\nVanille and Hope steal an airbike and follow Snow. They crash-land within the Vestige, and after venturing farther inside, a group of Cie'th ambushes them—mindless monsters that l'Cie become when they fail their Focus. Snow saves them and explains he is trying to save his fiancée Serah, a Pulse l'Cie held somewhere in the Vestige. L'Cie serve the fal'Cie who branded them and gain a mission to complete known as a Focus.\n\nHope yells at Snow for wanting to save Cocoon's enemy, but Snow has Hope and Vanille accompany him deeper into the structure out of concern for their safety. They find Lightning and Sazh with Serah outside Anima's Throne, who crystallizes with Hope explaining it happens to l'Cie who complete their Focus. The army attacks the Vestige, and when Lightning, Sazh, and Snow awaken the sleeping fal'Cie, Hope tries to run, but his path is blocked. After the others defeat Anima, everyone is branded a l'Cie. The damaged Vestige destroys the Hanging Edge and plummets to Lake Bresha below, crystallizing it on impact.\n\nEveryone decides to work together to solve their Focus and identify the legendary beast Ragnarok from a shared dream vision, believing their Focus is to destroy Cocoon. The group finds Serah's crystal form stuck in the crystallized lake. Snow stays to dig her out while the others continue. Hope tries to tell Snow about Nora, but Snow tells him to hurry or get left behind. The party finds an airship in the abandoned ruins at the lake's edge. Sazh attempts to pilot it, but it suffers damage from a PSICOM pursuit and crashes in the Vile Peaks.\n\nLightning plans to get revenge against the Sanctum by destroying the capital city Eden's namesake fal'Cie that runs the government. Drawn by Lightning's strength and determination, Hope follows her to gain battle experience and toughen up. The two become separated from Vanille and Sazh and decide to go through the Gapra Whitewood and Palumpolum to catch a train bound for Eden. Against Lightning's orders, Hope takes control of a Pulsian Dreadnought, a relic from the war between the two worlds centuries ago, and clears a path for them. Lightning's patience runs thin as Hope fails to keep up with her, and she threatens to leave him, inadvertently summoning her Eidolon Odin, who attacks Hope. Lightning saves him, and Hope helps her defeat the Eidolon, persuading Lightning to have faith in the boy and help him \"toughen up\".\n\nIn the Gapra Whitewood, Hope asks to take the lead, and Lightning lends him her survival knife to boost his confidence. Hope reveals his motive for following her: to become strong enough to punish Snow for Nora's death. When Lightning claims the Sanctum killed his mother and not Snow, Hope targets both. To dissuade him, Lightning suggests they see Hope's father and tell him about Nora.\n\nTo avoid the PSICOM troops stationed throughout Palumpolum, Hope leads Lightning underground into the Nutriculture Complex, where they see the fal'Cie Carbuncle that provides food for Cocoon. When Hope mentions the fal'Cie treat humans as their pets, Lightning realizes they've been fal'Cie pawns since birth, and fighting blindly to compensate for doubt and confusion isn't the answer. She tells Hope to abandon his plan for revenge and talk to his father to find a new reason to keep fighting. Returning to the surface, PSICOM general Yaag Rosch and his troops ambush Lightning and Hope. Snow and his new l'Cie ally Fang arrive and save them. Lightning forces Hope to escape with Snow while Fang goes with her.\n\nOn a wireless communicator, the groups agree on Hope's place in Felix Heights as their rendezvous point. Hope still intends to kill Snow, whose optimism and ignorance continue to anger him as he unknowingly insults Nora and the events surrounding her death. Hope asks Snow a series of personal questions to justify his desire for revenge, only to be further aggravated by Snow's answers. After making their way through the Rivera Towers and escaping an angry mob, an Ushumgal Subjugator attacks them.\n\nHope confronts Snow about Nora, unleashing his rage and blasting Snow off the building's roof, leaving him hanging from the edge. As Hope draws Lightning's knife, a Sanctum airship fires shots behind him, knocking him unconscious and blasting him off the building. Snow catches him in midair and shields him from the fall with his body. Hope awakens on the streets below to find Snow saved him. Snow apologizes for endangering Nora and being unable to save her and returns Lightning's knife, giving Hope a second chance for revenge. Hope confesses he knew nothing would bring Nora back and used revenge to cope with her death. The Ushumgal Subjugator returns and knocks Snow out, prompting Hope to fight it alone until Lightning and Fang arrive to help. Hope returns Lightning's knife, and they promise to protect each other. The reunited party heads to the Estheim Residence and meets Bartholomew.\n\nHope tells his father everything that's happened, and they mend their relationship. Bartholomew forgives Snow as he fulfilled Nora's dying wish of getting Hope home. PSICOM attacks the house, and Snow faces Yaag Rosch. Under Lightning's orders, Hope ties up his father to make him look like an unwilling accomplice. Rygdea and more of the Cavalry soldiers arrive, and Hope and the others leave with them, boarding the Cavalry's airship, the Lindblum.\n\nThe Cavalry is a rogue army unit that opposes Cocoon's fal'Cie-led government and aids the party in the hopes they will help topple Sanctum. With the Cavalry's help, the party infiltrates the Sanctum's flagship, the Palamecia, upon learning Sazh and Vanille are held captive on board. They reunite with the prisoners and face Primarch Galenth Dysley, who reveals his form as the fal'Cie Barthandelus, the Cocoon fal'Cie's leader. Barthandelus claims the group's Focus is to become Ragnarok and kill the fal'Cie Orphan, the source of Cocoon's power.\n\nThey escape the Palamecia into the Fifth Ark hidden beneath Eden, where the party's l'Cie powers fully awaken. They are confronted by the Cavalry leader, Cid Raines, who reveals himself as a Sanctum l'Cie branded by Barthandelus to help them destroy Cocoon, so the mass of expiring souls can open the Door of Souls and summon the Maker—the god said to have created the fal'Cie and humanity—back to the world. They defeat Raines, but he turns to crystal despite opposing his Focus, inspiring the party to follow suit. After Fang tames her Eidolon, Bahamut, Hope resolves to make his own decisions without the Sanctum or the fal'Cie's influence and see what Gran Pulse is like for himself.\n\nUsing an old Pulsian airship, they exit the Ark out into Gran Pulse. After a wild wyvern destroys their airship, they create a base camp in the Vallis Media. The party searches Pulse for days but finds no traces of human life. While gathering food, Hope's l'Cie brand advances, and he falls unconscious. Coming to later at night, Hope says Fang and Vanille's hometown of Oerba might have the answers they're looking for but considers himself too weak for the journey. He urges the others to go on without him, but his anguish summons his Eidolon, Alexander. After Hope tames it, the party comes to believe the Eidolons appear to give l'Cie hope, not to end their journey through death. Hope says he will ask for help earlier next time and continues the trip with the others.\n\nIn the Yaschas Massif, Hope tells Vanille he wouldn't have been able to know a wondrous place like Gran Pulse existed if he hadn't attended the fireworks festival and gotten forced onto the Purge train. Vanille says he would have seen Pulse anyway since he promised her they'd see it together. Hope doesn't remember making such a promise, and Vanille thinks it could be another of her lies. Hope says people sometimes lie to either cope or protect someone, but it's what they do afterward that matters. He says everything a person grows up believing as fact sometimes turns out to be false, and perhaps he and Vanille made a promise to each other but forgot. When Vanille blushes after Hope says that her smile makes him happy, he laughs at her embarrassment and runs off with Vanille giving chase.\n\nIn the Mah'habara Subterra, Hope tampers with another Dreadnought and falls into the path of the incoming Pulsian fal'Cie, Atomos. A group of Dreadnoughts spring to life and stop Atomos, saving Hope. The party uses Atomos to travel to the Sulyya Springs and rides a capsule from atop Taejin's Tower to the decaying village of Oerba. Barthandelus confronts the party again, claiming he has appointed a revived Raines as primarch and tricked the Cavalry into destroying Orphan.\n\nThe party returns to Cocoon to foil Barthandelus's plan and fights its way through Eden to Orphan's Cradle, where the party fights Barthandelus. Upon Barthandelus's defeat, Orphan awakens and reveals its wish for Cocoon's destruction. Everyone except Vanille and Fang transforms into Cie'th. Remembering everything they endured on their journey, the group returns to normal, believing it to have been another fal'Cie trick. They save Fang from her cycle of torture at Orphan's hands and declare they now have a new Focus: save Cocoon. Hope concludes that if they have the power to destroy Cocoon, they can also save it, after which everyone's l'Cie brands turn white.\n\nAfter Orphan's defeat, Cocoon loses power and falls from the sky. Fang and Vanille sacrifice themselves to become Ragnarok and save Cocoon by erecting a crystal pillar to support the crystallized Cocoon above Gran Pulse. Alongside the rest of the party, a crystallized Hope rests at the pillar's base, but they soon awaken with their brands wiped clean. Though Serah and Dajh also awaken, Hope is upset Vanille and Fang did not, but remains positive, remarking they have defied their fate before.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII -Episode i-[]\n\nIt doesn't matter. Thank you. Knowing he's safe is enough.\n\nHope, about his father\n\nHope sees a group of Cavalry soldiers and runs off to meet them with the others following. A soldier tells Hope his father is still alive and arriving on the next cargo transport, and Hope leaves with the soldier to reunite with Bartholomew.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 Fragments Before[]\n\nYou're not one to think about things anyway.\n\nHope to Snow\n\nAfter Lightning disappears, Hope finds her knife near the crystal pillar's base and returns it to Serah. Shortly after, he participates in relief efforts with soldiers on Gran Pulse, and his father notes Hope's willingness as a token of the maturity he gained through his journey as a l'Cie.\n\nReturning to Palumpolum, he studies diligently to atone for his sins. In 3 AF, Snow tells him they may have been wrong about Lightning holding up the pillar with Vanille and Fang. Hope joins the Academy to follow in his father's footsteps to help rebuild society and find a way to free Vanille and Fang. Within the next two years, he skips several grades to pursue his degree and becomes the Academy's leader at 19 years old.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2[]\n\nI wanted to change history, make things better. Not just bring Lightning back. But Vanille, and Fang... and my mother.\n\nHope to Serah\n\nWhen Serah, Noel, and Mog arrive in the Paddra Ruins of the Yaschas Massif in 10 AF, Hope aids them during their battle against Aloeidai. Hope reveals Noel and Serah's appearance in the Bresha Ruins five years ago enabled the Academy to analyze the Time Gates and predict their arrival to the ruins. He says that Snow, Sazh, and Dajh also disappeared within the last ten years, all having become time travelers like Serah. Hope says the paradoxes started happening a few years ago and believes if he can solve their cause, he could see everyone again.\n\nHope explains he joined the Academy to atone for Lightning, Fang, and Vanille's fates and build a society using human-made power. He and his assistant, Alyssa Zaidelle, tell Serah and Noel about the Farseers led by the seeress Yeul who lived in Paddra in ancient times. Hope shows Serah and Noel the Oracle Drive, an old device that shows visions of events considered impossible. The Oracle Drive displays images of the events leading to the Day of Ragnarok. It also displays blurry images of Lightning's fight with Caius Ballad in the mysterious world, Valhalla, that exists between the mortal world and the unseen realm of the dead. Hope theorizes the paradox affecting the area is also affecting the Oracle Drive and gives an artefact to Noel and Serah so they can fix it.\n\nAfter Noel and Serah resolve the paradox, they repeat their meeting with Hope in the alternate timeline at 1X AF before he again uses the Oracle Drive to show them the now-clear images of Lightning in Valhalla. When the Oracle Drive shows Cocoon falling at Caius's hands, Hope resolves to do what he can to prepare for the crisis while Serah and Noel continue to fix the timeline. Three years later, while overseeing Augusta Tower's construction, Hope and Alyssa devise the Proto fal'Cie Project to keep Cocoon airborne without the crystal pillar.\n\nActing on its own from the future, the Proto fal'Cie Adam arrives at that moment in time to reprogram the tower's AI and slaughter Hope, Alyssa, and the Academy members to maintain the time and order it is thriving in. Back in 1X AF, Hope catches a glimpse of Serah and Noel's fight with Adam in the Augusta Tower in 200 AF. Serah yelling at him for building the fal'Cie through the Oracle Drive causes Hope to abandon the project, negating his and Alyssa's future deaths. Hope begins the New Cocoon Project to construct an artificial Cocoon. In the alternate timeline at 12 AF, Hope attends the New Nautilus Auditorium Opening Concert and gives his old classmate Elida a bouquet.\n\nThe following year, Hope learns about the Thirteenth Ark through the Oracle Drive and invents a time capsule for him and Alyssa to enter suspended animation and reawaken 387 years later in Academia 4XX AF, where the Ark is supposed to appear—welcoming Serah and Noel to \"the future they saved\". Hope invites them to the Academy headquarters, where he explains that after investigating the Thirteenth Ark, the Academy discovered it floats through the use of a Graviton Core. After Noel, Serah and Mog bring him the needed Graviton Cores, Alyssa gives them an artefact to open a new Time Gate in the city. As Hope and Alyssa go see them off, Hope reflects on his past as a l'Cie when he was almost consumed by hate until Lightning and Snow showed him a way out. Promising to meet Noel and Serah again a century in the future, they part ways.\n\nIn Final Fantasy XIII-2 Fragments After, Hope and Alyssa go to the Augusta Tower to investigate an intruder in the system. Hope disposes of the duplicates trying to kill him and finds Alyssa's diary in the network that details the Bresha Ruins' events in 5 AF. He discovers Alyssa's hatred for the Pulse l'Cie for causing the Purge; her existence as a paradox; how she fears everyone forgetting her, and her research won't be remembered as hers, with her life rendered meaningless if Serah and Noel resolve the paradox. She sided with Caius to save herself, receiving a false artefact from him while sleeping in the time capsule with Hope. Caius had told her to give it to Serah and Noel to dispose of them, which she did when they found the Graviton Cores, and now Alyssa plans to deal with Hope in the Augusta Tower.\n\nHope pleads with Alyssa, promising to find a way for her to survive in the fixed timeline. Alyssa holds Hope at gunpoint, but before she pulls the trigger, she starts disappearing and begs him not to forget her. In Academia 500 AF, Hope vaguely remembers Alyssa and now has an intern named Aina Stein. Aina is the descendant of Alyssa's friend Nena, the one meant to survive the Purge in Alyssa's place.\n\nIn Academia 500 AF, when Chaos Bahamut attacks Noel and Serah, Hope arrives with a squadron of soldiers to provide backup. They pursue Caius on an airship piloted by Sazh, but Serah tells him to ensure Fang and Vanille are safe inside the crystal pillar, and Hope departs. After Noel and Serah defeat Caius in Valhalla, Hope and his team monitor the crystal pillar's status as it's due to collapse at any moment. After safely removing Vanille and Fang from the pillar, the old Cocoon falls, and the new Cocoon rises, which Hope christens \"Bhunivelze\".\n\nLearning that Noel, Mog, and Serah have returned from Valhalla, Hope takes an airship to greet them only to find Serah has died. As they mourn her, Noel reveals Serah was a seeress like Yeul and killed by her visions. The world darkens, and Mog says the goddess Etro is gone. Noel realizes he unknowingly played into Caius's scheme and killed Etro. Etro's seal appears in the sky, and Bhunivelze and Gran Pulse are consumed by chaos, the evil substance that flows from the unseen realm. The world merges with Valhalla, as without the goddess holding the chaotic energy back, it bursts into the mortal realm.\n\nThe Chaotic Era[]\n\nThe companion novella, Final Fantasy XIII: Reminiscence -tracer of memories-, details the intervening events between Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII.\n\nHope tried to maintain peace in the dying Nova Chrysalia, the world formed from the merger of Gran Pulse and Valhalla. His steadfast resolve inspired the survivors burdened by their daily struggles against the Chaos and their eventual extinction, and he became seen as a symbol of hope for humanity. Though humans have become biologically immortal, they can no longer bear children. Hope had the Academy's scientists analyze the situation for humanity's long-term plan with all citizens evacuated inside the artificial Cocoon. After discovering that no new children could be born, the Academy created the Conseil de Renaissance as the people's new hope, tasked with finding a way to reverse the Chaos's effects.\n\nA new fal'Cie cultivated the lands for human habitation to lure people into abandoning their deteriorating Cocoon, a decision Hope eventually made. A team of scientists remained to use the state-of-the-art facilities to find a means to fight the Chaos. Their existence was highly-classified, with Hope secretly overseeing the research. The scientists soon discovered they could control Chaos via Antimatter Manipulation Principle, a technology once used in the original Cocoon.\n\nThe scientists went missing with only the words spelling, \"The woman with the rose-colored hair takes us with her\", left behind. Three hundred thirty-one years after Chaos entered the world, Hope began to hallucinate a pink-haired phantom. Identifying it with Lightning, he became obsessed with it and relived the past in his dreams alongside the illusion until he couldn't separate fantasy from reality. It was Bhunivelze's work, the god who created the deities Pulse, Lindzei, and Etro to find the door to the unseen realm, his servants having crafted the worlds of Gran Pulse and Cocoon. He woke from his slumber when the worlds merged. Though Bhunivelze can't control people's hearts, he can create illusions. The phantom lured Hope into the now-deserted artificial Cocoon, where he remained within the Ark.\n\nBhunivelze sought to use Hope as his agent to ensure the savior's compliance, act as his new vessel, and remove Hope's influence from society. Without Hope's leadership, the remaining populace would instead turn to the Order of Salvation, a religious group that worships Bhunivelze, to find their \"hope\" for the future. Hope messaged Snow about Lightning's foreseen return as the savior and warned him of the fake Lightning. Bhunivelze tortured Hope and regressed him into a teenager to better meet his standards as a \"pure and innocent\" vessel and better understand humans.[note 1] Over the next 169 years, Bhunivelze tortured and damaged Hope's heart and rendered him nearly emotionless as Bhunivelze continued to mold him into the perfect host.\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII[]\n\nWelcome back, Light.\n\nHope to Lightning, said whenever Lightning returns to the Ark\n\nWhen Lightning awakes from crystal stasis 13 days before the the end of the world, Bhunivelze chooses her as the savior. Hope aids her from the Ark, staying in contact with her via wireless communication. At 6 AM each morning, Hope summons Lightning back to the Ark, where they can talk about the day's events and what their old comrades are doing. Hope briefly loses contact with Lightning when Lumina pulls her into Lightning's subconscious to talk with her privately, warning her that she can't fully trust Hope as what he learns is transmitted to Bhunivelze. Lightning's task is to save the people's souls before the world ends for them to be reborn in a new world crafted by Bhunivelze.\n\nOn the final day, when Lightning finds herself in her subconscious, Hope's heart appears before her. He reveals his role as Bhunivelze's eyes to monitor her, stating he will cease to be as his purpose is over. Regardless, Hope is glad to be himself again. He encourages Lightning to save Vanille from going through with the Soulsong, a ritual the Order of Salvation has fooled her to perform that would kill her. He believes Vanille will make the right choice as long as she knows the truth. Hope tells Lightning she has to make a choice too to find Serah's soul. As Lightning laments failing to protect him, Hope says it was because of her that he no longer fears the future, not even now, and fades away.\n\nLightning and Fang convince Vanille to guide the souls of the dead to the Ark to be reborn in the new world rather than destroy them with the Soulsong. Bhunivelze awakens and uses Hope's now-heartless body as a medium to absorb the souls of Noel, Fang, Vanille, and Snow. When Lightning sets out to confront Bhunivelze in Cosmogenesis, the god—using Hope's body as his avatar—explains that Lightning's interference in the Soulsong leaves him with no choice but to destroy the new world. Using Hope's body as an example before slaying it out of whim, Bhunivelze explains his plans to rule over the new humans he will create[note 2] while saying he does not know where Hope's heart is. Unknown to Bhunivelze, he absorbed Hope's heart, explaining why he now speaks with Hope's voice[note 3] and why he is suddenly feeling emotions, making him vulnerable.\n\nAfter Lightning defeats Bhunivelze, Hope is free again. Lightning tells him to reunite with his parents' spirits in the next life while she stays to take Bhunivelze with her into the new unseen realm. After Lightning accepts Lumina as a part of herself, Hope helps her leave the world of her subconscious to aid her in fighting Bhunivelze. Joined by their friends and the Eidolons, Hope lends his power to Lightning to land the final blow to the god. After witnessing Nova Chrysalia's destruction and the creation of a new unseen realm, Hope and his friends find a crystal floating in a void. Their souls, alongside those of the rest of humanity, travel to a new world where they begin their lives anew.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII: Reminiscence -tracer of memories-[]\n\nNow that I can look back on it, I was sustaining myself with hate. The despair of losing my mother and becoming a l’Cie was too heavy for me. I deceived myself and aimed my anger at the closest target. I blamed my mother’s death on Snow and despised him for it. If Light hadn’t stopped me and pulled me back, I don’t know where I’d be right now.\n\nHope to Aoede\n\nReborn in the new world as a young man, Hope works as an unaffiliated researcher excelling in humanities and society. A reporter named Aoede finds him during her investigation of people with strange memories of \"another world\". Hope tells Aoede his story and about the friends he made. He describes Lightning as a strict but gentle person who watched over him, explaining that he initially depended on her for protection and guidance but later wanted to protect her too upon realizing she also suffered and felt lost."
