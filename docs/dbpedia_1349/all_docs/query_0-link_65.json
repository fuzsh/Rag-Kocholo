        "text": "My outsider's impression of Final Fantasy XIII from the general public was that it was a good, if highly controversial title for the time, and after making my way through XIII, I can see why that conclusion was drawn. Objectively, this game looks gorgeous, combat is fresh and dynamic and characters and story are on a scale comparable to the best the series has to offer.\n\nThough I imagine the qualities that make the game so bemoaned by some is the complete abandonment of features that run back to the series' roots. The game is far and away the most linear experience the series has to offer, and there's little in the way of side quests. Customisation has been shaved down to the bare essentials, and classes have been replaced with roles, which replace the aesthetic and flare of classes with laser focused purpose designed to function as part of a group. All of these changes were probably controversial for the time, especially coming off the back of Final Fantasy XII, which offered the most expansive real time world to date, complete with myriad characters and sidequests. In terms of the actual world you are exploring, there's no doubt that XIII is a downgrade in that department.\n\nBut I don't know if I can necessarily begrudge a game for failing to do something that it clearly wasn't trying to do in the first place. I think XIII knows what it is, and if I were to describe it in one word; it would be \"Spectacular\", in every sense of the word. All of XIII's strengths lie I'm it's presentation, and it's possible that to make that work, the game might have required a bit of railroading.\n\nNow I might be a bit biased because I am currently trying to play through the entire Final Fantasy series, so maybe I view any deviation from the norm as a novel change of pace, but I was never particularly aghast at the notion of linearity in XIII. I had just come off the back of Final Fantasy VIII, where the overworld could feel like a bit of a slog at times (clearly the devs agreed or they wouldn't have given you cars, chocobos and flying campuses.) I did find it funny any time the game tried to create the illusion of exploration by having an alternative path that lead to an item, before immediately wrapping back around to your intended course.\n\nNow the game does make one very earnest attempt at \"openness\" and that's when you first land on Pulse, the land below Cocoon (the starting area). This happens around the halfway point of the game, and the game abandons the linear corridors that were characteristic of the game up until that point, in favour of a vast open plains, complete with cracks and crevices to explore around the outskirts. They also give you side quests in the form of Ci'eth Stones, which task you with hunting down specific monsters for a range of rewards, from items to new warp points. The areas were fun to explore and I did do quite a few of these missions, though once you move past this area, it isn't long until you return to corridors and wrapping detours. It makes for a brief highlight in the game, though it also offers a window into what could've been for the game.\n\nThough the main reason why I'm not too pushed about the exploration aspect is because what the game is really concerned about showcasing is flashy, dynamic, \"spectacular\" combat. It probably goes without saying that XIII is the best looking game to it's point, and this translates to everything from the overworld, to the cutscenes to, of course, the combat.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII uses the now long proven Active Timed Battle (ATB) system for it's turn-based combat. The twist that this game makes on the tried and true formula is that, rather than use MP for your skills, all actions use up a chunk of your ATB bar. So in a literal sense, actions cost time. Most attacks will use one chunk of the ATB bar, while stronger techniques will use 2, 3, 4 and very rarely 5. You can also line up actions up to the amount of ATB Bars you have (you start off with 3 and can end the game with 5) so there's a degree of planning to your the options you make during your turn. (Though not to nearly the same extent as XII's Gambit System)\n\nThe game lacks the tradional class system featuring favourites like Black Mage, Warrior, White Mage and so one. Instead, the game uses its own 6 categorisations for party member functions; Commando (Melee Damage), Ravager (Magic Damage), Medic (Healing), Sentinel (Drawing Aggro), Synergist (Buffing) and Saboteur (Debuffing). The way that XIII handles the distribution of these \"Roles\" is interesting, and offers and compelling compromise on Square's insistence on stripping away a character's mechanical identity in favour of flexibility.\n\nEach character starts off with the ability to use 1 of 2 Roles. For example, Lightning, the protagonist, has access to both the Commando and Ravager classes with no issues. After a point in the game, your party members start to get the ability to use a 3rd role. In Lightning's case, she gets access to the Medic role. Initially, I was optimistic that this is where it would end, as having the characters be mechanically defined by which 3 Roles they could perform would actually be an interesting design choice. Though those hopes were quickly squashed, as at a certain point, you are granted the ability to assign any role to any character. I was disappointed to find that once again, an opportunity for cool mechanical uniqueness was lost.\n\nExcept it really wasn't.\n\nSee there's quite a few caveats to this new form of flexibility. Going back a few steps, remember when I said Lightning got access to the Medic Role? Well, while she's pretty good at it, she never seemed to get access to as strong Medic skills as Hope and Vanille, two characters who had access to the role right out the gate. This seems to go further if you try to spec a character into a Role they're not equipped for. When I got the ability to assign characters to all roles, I begrudgingly decided I could use another Synergist. So I began assigning skill points to Snow (who is proficient with Sentinel, Commando and Ravager Roles). Not only are their skill trees extremely anaemic compared to their proficient trees, but it seems to require more skill points to progress these skill trees; to the point that there is a legitimate opportunity cost to invest in the Roles characters aren't good at. I think this is actually really cool, as it turns this addional flexibility into something that has to be committed to; either as an additional challenge, or something to help in the postgame, which I'd how I feel that should be used.\n\nBut how do these Roles actually play out in combat. While the game's combat does provide some ways of hitting multiple enemies, this game heavily incentivises piling on as much damage as possible onto individual enemies. Each enemy has its own chain gauge that, when you deal damage to them, fills. After the gauge reaches a point dependant on the enemy, the enemy becomes staggered, leaving it open to massive damage. You can defeat enemies the traditional way, but especially later when the health pools get absurd, this stagger state is the key to victory. Both the Ravager and Commando classes are important to building stagger, especially in conjunction with one another. Commando attacks will maintain the chain gauge, but will do little to add to it, while the inverse is true for Ravagers. So it's important that you have the right lineup of Roles set up to rack up damage.\n\nAnd lining up the right roles for the job is precisely the purpose of XIII's unique combat system; the Paradigm System. A Paradigm is the name given to the formations made up of any 3 Roles. For example, a combination of Commando/Ravager/Ravager forms the Paradigm \"Relentless Assault\", while the combination of Commando/Medic/Synergist forms the Paradigm \"Hero's Charge\". You can switch between a choice of 6 preset Paradigms at the drop of a hat using the Paradigm Shift action, which forms the backbone of this game's combat.\n\nThis all comes together to form one of the most entertaining combat systems to watch in action, where you get to see the party work as a team. I enjoyed watching Lightning maintain a boss' Chain Guage, while Sazh knocks it up with magic, all the while Hope is topping up the party's health after a particularly nasty AOE attack. There's a certain synergy you see that you don't get with the other games once you figure the system out.\n\nBut it isn't 100% perfect either. The way combat works in Final Fantasy XIII does bring about some unique issues. Interestingly, attacks in this game have hitboxes, rather than being guaranteed hits like in prior games. This means that moves can whiff, both against you and against the enemy. Bizarrely however, the game offers you no means to actually move your characters around during combat, so most cases of whiffing are usually accidental. It rarely impacts situations where missing a stray hit would actually matter so it's not the end of the world, but it does break the rhythm of the fight a bit when it happens.\n\nThe game's focus on damaging the individual rather than the group also means that fighting groups can be tedious and potentially even very dangerous. The game does have a preemptive strike system where, if you engage an enemy from behind, you can start the fight with full ATB Guage and the enemy Chain Guages almost at max. Though, this is still ineffective against groups because, by the time you finish taking down one enemy, it's likely the rest have exited their stagger states. This gets especially egregious in the endgame, where regular enemies' health lies in the hundreds of thousands to even millions. The hassle of fighting groups is further exasperated by the fact that many enemies have moves that can flat out interrupt your attacks, eating up the ATB that you sunk to perform the action. Again, this is really bad in the late game.\n\nThe game also operates on that party rule that particular JRPGs had where, if the party lead I knocked out, it's an immediate game over. This doesn't feel like the sort of game that needed that honestly. I've definitely gotten my clock cleaned towards the end of a difficult fight because I tunnel visioned and missed that my party lead was in danger of dying.\n\nI also feel that the combat system's most egregious problems result in the game's final dungeon being probably one of my least favourite in the series. Enemy HP gets really high towards the end, to the point where achieving stagger is a must. Depending on the encounter, you could get anything from two enemies that you really don't want to leave alone, that you will inevitably have to leave alone, to one particularly strong creature paired with 3 other guys who are really good at interrupting your actions. Granted, some of these issue can be mitigated by running a Sentinel Role in your party, but that doesn't fix the tedium of having to grind down damage sponges for even minor encounters.\n\nMy negatives on the combat sound scathing, but in reality, most of the game doesn't have these issues. They only really come to light towards the end of the game.\n\nI think the lead up to the story shift at the halfway point is actually very well done for what it wants to do. And a large part of that is to do with the story.\n\nFinal Fantsay XIII's story is set on a floating Colony called Cocoon, where humans live comfortable, if sheltered lives; their every need tended to by the Fal'cie, large psudo-mechanical entities that act as guardians. Longtime fans would recognise the names given to many of these Fal'cie, as they share their names with some classic FF summons of old; Eden, Carbuncle, Anima etc. The Fal'cie can assign humans to act out their will in the form of a mission (called a Focus)in exchange for power, rendering them a L'Cie. Should they fail to carry out their Focus however, they are stripped of their humanity and rendered shambling husks of their old selves called Cie'th.\n\nThe relationship between humans and Fal'cie is viewed by the general public a benevolent, though it has deeper, more sinister layers to it. The surface world below Cocoon, known as Pulse, has its own Fal'Cie and L'Cie. Pulse and Cocoon were at war in the distant past and now, through propaganda, anything from Pulse has been demonised to a xenophobic degree. No one on Cocoon knows what Pulse is like, just that it and everything from it is nothing short of demonic. Anyone who comes into contact with Pulse, regardless of whether they were born and raised on Cocoon, needs to be separated from the rest of the populous. This is disguised to the public as exiting them to Pulse, but in reality, they are killed off in a Purge. It is this Purging that acts as the catalyst for XIII's story, as it is the connecting thread that brings these characters together.\n\nThe party shares more or less equal importance to the game's story, as they have a shared fate and mission. Though the face if the game is undoubtedly Lightning, an ex Guardian Corp soldier that stowed onto a train filled with soon-to-be purgees. Her self-appointed mission is to save her sister, Serah, who had been branded a L'Cie by Pulse, before she is turned into a Cie'th. Her mission brings her to a Pulse Vestige that was hoisted up from the surface world into Cocoon. It is in this nexus of fate that Lightning, along with 4 other party members, find Serah, who apparently having completed her Focus in having brought these 5 people together, achieves immortality in the form of turning into crystal. Following this, Lightning and co. are branded Pulse L'Cie by Anima; the Fal'Cie that resided in the Pulse Vestige, though all they are given for the purpose of their Focus is a vague dream of a monster destroying Cocoon; a monster that one of the party members, Vanille, recognises as Ragnarok. Snow concludes their Focus must be to save Cocoon from this Ragnarok and the rest of the party seemingly just goes with that, tentatively accepting that Serah's Focus was to give them that mission.\n\nI only bring up the circumstances to this party's meeting so it doesn't need to be repeated for every character. But in terms of Lightning's character, I quite like her! She gives a similar impression to Squall from FFVIII, though with notable differences. Like Squall, she is a serious, no-nonsense character clearly designed to be cool and for the most part it works. However, unlike with Squall, who's self-imposed apathy made it hard to connect with him initially, it's not long before we get a significant range of emotions out of Lightning. Her opening scene shows that while she has her own agenda, she isn't past helping those around her that would be affected by her actions, providing the Purge train prisoners opportunity to flee the scene. When we do get to the Vestige, interactions with Snow and Sazh highlight an urgency in finding her sister as soon as possible. Her scene with Sazh, where they exposit about the potential for Serah to have become a Cie'th is of note, as we see a panicked refusal from Lightning to even entertain the possibility. When she does finally find her sister and witnesses her turning to crystal, she's quick to reject that there's anything that could be done to reverse this outcome, expressing intense frustration at Snow's insistence to the contrary. She shows pragmatism, but her change in demeanor in matters regarding her sister shows that there's something underlying her current personality. Similar to Squall's masking, Lightning felt she had to be stronger to overcome her trauma of loss; it just happens that their different views I'm what it means to be stronger manifested in different personalities.\n\nAnother thing I like about Lightning is that, for all her militaristic stoicism, she's also tender and motherly. This comes to ahead when she and Hope are separated from the rest of the party and are forced to reach their destination. Hope is not a fighter by any stretch; he is a freshly orphaned young boy trying to grapple with grief over his mother and vengeance for her death. By all accounts, both have reasons to hate Snow, as both feel he is in part responsible for the loss of their loved ones. As such, in seeing Hope's wishes for vengeance, she sees herself in him; she sees his want to get stronger to achieve his ends and takes him under her wing, promising to toughen him up. She meets him on his level, and seems to show genuine pride in the development of his ability both I'm and out of the field.\n\nIt's cooler still because they both rub off on each other. Lightning isn't afraid to admit when she's wrong. When she starts to see how Hope's chase for Vengeance is warping him, she realises the negative influence her line of thinking is doing to the impressionable youth and even attempts to break off from him as a way to make amends. There's an element of self-sacrifice to Lightning; she feels she failed to protect Serah, so she is unworthy of being relied on, unworthy of relying on and unworthy of rest. She throws herself headlong into battle alone with her companions, whether it be Sazh or Hope, trailing behind her exasperated. She's self-destructive and she recognises that those qualities are rubbing off on Hope. When she realises the influence her own form of grieving is having on those around her, she's quick to try and rectify that whatever way she sees fit. The catch is that her solution to correcting her mistakes using involves her doing it alone. She couldn't protect Serah, so now she needs to take down the government alone. She's turning Hope into a bloodthirsty bastard, so she has to push Hope away and seperate herself from him. It's once Lightning learns to trust in others good intention through Hope that she is able to flourish as a character. Once she accepts that Snow truly has Serah's best interests in mind and is trying earnestly to save her, she starts to let herself believe that there might be a way to save her and becomes more amicable (in her own way) with Snow.\n\nIn short, Lightning is a good protagonist. Her development from a self-destructive pessimist seeking redemption for her percieved failures to a leader that learns to trust her comrades is an interesting arc to watch unfold. An interesting observation I made when she reconciles with Snow is that she never says she forgives him, she herself apologises for putting the blame on him. She's not trying to meet him halfway, but putting the blame entirely on herself for allowing her perspective on Serah's situation clouding her perception of Snow's intentions. Her approach to forgiveness is still self-punishing, but that makes for a believable start to her road to recovery.\n\nSnow is a character who is closely tied to both Lightning and Serah, so he's a good character to touch on next. He's directly tied to Lightning through Serah, being her fiance. As such, what brings him into the fold of the game's events lines up similarly to Lightning's; he's looking to save Serah. Notably, in contrast to Lightning, who comes right off the back of the Guardian Corps, an enforcer of the system, Snow is introduced as the leader of NORA, a newly founded resistance group actively fighting against the Purge. It's interesting how, despite these characters wanting the same thing, the difference in circumstance and outlook between Snow and Lightning puts them at odds regardless.\n\nA good example of this is when they finally do find Serah, and she turns to crystal after fulfilling her Focus. Lightning is quick to turn cynical, surrendering that Serah is gone and proceeds to rain hell on Anima, the Fal'cie residing in the Vestige. Snow, however, remains optimistic, perhaps even to the point of delusion and denial, that there has to be a way to save Serah. Lightning's overwillingness to surrender hope versus Snow's stubborn denial drives a wedge from them very early on.\n\nIn fact, it's quite interesting just *how* much ire Snow seems to draw, despite his self-proclaimed \"Hero\" moniker. Snow displays mannerisms similar to Balthier's \"Leading Man\" Role in FFXII, where all of his actions are dictated on what would be appropriate for his self-appointed Role. He'll throw himself into battle because that's what heroes do, he knows he'll be okay because the hero never dies, he'll save everyone because he's the hero; and perhaps he truly believes that he will save Serah because the hero always gets the girl in the end.\n\nThe cruel reality though is that, right out the gate, we know Snow can't save everyone; he doesn't. Almost immediately, his rebellion is squashed, and many of the citizens he enlists immediately after rescuing them are unceremoniously snuffed out by a power far above their scale, including Hope's mother; a death that claws at him even before he connects Hope to her. He couldn't save Serah the first time, he couldn't save Hope's mother, and at the time, he didn't even know who Hope's mother was asking him to protect in her stead. When he finally meets Serah again, hey are immediately separated, and Snow has to cling onto the possibility that she can be saved, otherwise he's failed entirely in what he set out to do; he's failed as a hero.\n\nThus, Snow's development at its core seems to be learning the responsibility that comes with calling yourself a hero. He spends a solid chunk of the game haunted by those he couldn't save, he postures and blusters about being a hero, while throwing himself at danger to protect as many people as possible. But really, he's running away from the responsibility of failing to save those he couldn't. In that sense, despite them butting heads, Snow and Lightning actually display the same self-sacrifical, self-punishing behaviour throughout the story. The difference being that Lightning is a little too overeager to accept responsibility for tragedies that she really doesn't need to, while Snows suicidal nature seems to stem from a reckless abandonment of responsibility. So long as he can keep fighting, so long as he can keep taking punishment, he doesn't need to take time to digest on what he has failed to do.\n\nIt's appropriate then, that Snow operates as the premier Sentinal character of the team, drawing Aggro and absorbing monstrous damage with his large frame. His showboating and Brawler fighting style lead to him being a natural fit for the role. Conversely, he struggles to develop support classes like Synergist and Saboteur, likely a callback to his propensity to gun it alone.\n\nSpeaking of gunning it alone, that's probably the biggest trapping of Snow as a character; he gets separated from the rest of the party early on, so while the others get ample opportunity to interact and grow as characters, we only get brief snippets of what Snow is doing while he's gone. This does leave him having to make up for lost time when he does finally rejoin the group, and I think he does a good enough job, though he needs help from the rest of the party to do so. I think his key development points come to light when he's finally paired up with Hope, as the tension between a man running from his failures and a young man who has hyped himself for revenge creates great \"will they, don't they\" moments.\n\nHope is an interesting case. After finishing FFXIII, I can't help but feel like he's almost what I wanted Vaan to be in FFXII. Now, I liked Vaan well enough, but a trapping I found with him was that, by virtue of being the \"main character\", he by necessity has to reconcile his grievances with any party member he might have had. This comes into heavy effect with Bache, as Vaan goes from contempt to complacent with Bache withing the span of an hour after meeting with him. I get that we spend a good deal of the beginning of XII with Vaan being pissy at his oppressors, but he never actually gets to direct that at anyone he can form a dialogue with. And once Vaan loses that personal grudge and the story opens up in scale, Vaan kind of loses a narrative anchor to guide his development.\n\nHope, however, doesn't have that. Here we have this meek little kid who was convinced he was going to die to the Purge, having just been rescued by NORA (and Snow). His mother, likely against his wishes, enlisting herself to fight for a legitimately good cause, only to die unceremoniously, confirming his worst fears. To make matters worse, he has now been branded as a Pulse L'Cie, an entity he has been convinced through propaganda to be enemies beyond saving. All of this culminates in a traumatised young man who is practically bubbling with angst and anger, but with too many directions to fire that anger towards. Does he direct it towards the Fal'cie (which he is indentured to now), or towards Snow (who he now is forced to associate with). The hopelessness of the situation really challenges the ironically named victim.\n\nIt's interesting then that Hope, feeling a need to be stronger, immediately gravitates towards Lightning. Whether through her stoicism and reliability as a soldier, or through their mutual disdain for Snow, Hope finds himself practically glued to Lightning. This also serves as a great character moment for Lightning, where you see her reluctance to drag around a liability for his own benefit conflict with her natural warmth as an older sister. Initially, Lightning sees herself in Hope, someone who will sacrifice their soul if it means avenging the one closest to them. However, this dynamic shifts when Lightning realises their role among the Fal'cie, as mere pets or cattle to be farmed, as astutely theorised by Hope. It's only then that she realises that realise the corrupting effect her cynicism and ruthlessness is having on what is essentially a grieving child.\n\nThis leads to Lightning's attempt to abandon Hope, assuming it will serve him better in the long run. I think it's fair to say that a core theme of Hope's character is revenge, as that is the driving force of his character arc for a solid chunk of the game. However, I would also say a similarly strong theme is abandonment. Whether it's his choice or that of those close to him, Hope has a rough history with abandonment (at least in his eyes); he feels like he was abandoned by his mother when she leaves to fight for her family's freedom, he suffers anxiety around Lightning about not being strong enough for her to want him around, and even after reconciling with his father, he finds himself having to soon separate from him to leave him in enemy hands, an act he likely feels as equal to abandonment.\n\nHope is a dependant; he needs something to lean on. This is reflected heavily in his proficient roles. He's essentially a support class, sporting natural proficiency with Ravager/Synergist/Medic, three classes that are heavily reliant on surrounding party members, rather than being an anchor like Commando or Sentinel. It's clear throughout the story that he doesn't hold himself highly as an asset to the party, showcased by his initial ask for the party to abandon him on Grand Pulse when he falls ill. It's this moment of crisis that causes the Eidolon Alexander to appear before him, giving him the opportunity to realise his own strength and his worth in the party. How fitting then, that the Eidolon he ends up with, Alexander, is a gargantuan bastion with which he can defend those behind him.\n\nUltimately, Hope's story is that of overcoming grief, anxiety and discovering your self-worth. Hope is type of character that can be pretty annoying to some people, though as I finished the game and especially as I gave him thought and wrote about him, I'm actually very endeared to the character. He bounces off a lot of characters well and he serves as a catalyst for a lot of meaningful character growth for other party members. He's pretty great actually!\n\nA character that accompanies Hope during the early parts of the game is Vanille, a girl around Hope's age of mysterious origins. They're very careful not to give much away about where she came from, but she seems strangely knowledgeable about Grand Pulse and all manners Pulse L'Cie. For a majority of the game, you have little reason to believe that she's a friend of Hope's that also got roped into the Purge. And for the most part, she's very characterful, upbeat and optimistic, if a little odd.\n\nAgain, she's a character that can come across as grating if presented to the wrong player, but I did find myself enjoying her well enough, though she struggles to break the higher echelons of my favour when it comes to party members. She got quite a few laughs out me; it's hard for her bubbliness to not rub off on you. Though, as you've probably expected reading this far in, Vanille has another side to her, several in fact! A core part of her story is that her past is shrouded in lies and half truths. Underlying her cheery demeanor and jokey protestations is a character mired in the tragedy of her involvement in a war she likely wanted no part in.\n\nAnd interesting point to Vanille's character is that, while she is a serial liar, it can't really be said that many of her lies were made with malicious or selfish intent. Vanille truly believes that her lies are there to protect people. She lies to Fang that it was Vanille herself that became Ragnarok in the previous conflict between Cocoon and Pulse, hating that Fang has to be the one to always burden herself and not her. Once again, here we have a character who feels they are unworthy of reprieve and feels they have to torture themselves as retribution.\n\nHowever, also see a example of the intention behind Vanille's lies being more ambiguous with, what I felt, was a more substantial lie; her involvement in the branding of Sazh's son, Dajh as a Cocoon Fal'Cie. For admittedly understandable reasons (more on those in a bit), Sazh is an avid hater of all things Pulse; Grand Pulse, Pulse Fal'Cie, Pulse L'Cie, all of it. So isn't it crazy then, that the character he ends up being separated from the party with is Vanille, a Pulse L'Cie in secret? I actually really like this personal crisis that Vanille has with Sazh. Sazh is a kind man, and it's clear from their interactions that they clearly enjoy each other's company. While she was around Hope around the beginning, there was always this sense that Hope was quite uneasy around her, and that Vanille was trying to hard to make him like her. With Sazh, on the other hand, they bounce off each other really well and both seem to really enjoy each other's company, bantering and chasing one another throughout their outing as a duo.\n\nThere is a tragedy in the \"Sugar and Rainbows\" chapter, one that really does serve as a powerful scene for both Sazh (more on that later) and Vanille. From the moment Sazh makes it clear quite early on in their joint journey that his hatred for Pulse Fal'Cie is non-negotiable, there is a real sense of Vanille tearing herself apart internally about her lie spiraling out of control. Some of us have surely had that moment in our lives where we had to keep up a lie to save face, only to watch as it throws the rest of our lives out of rhythm. And the worst case is when you don't let the cat out of the bag yourself and you get caught out. This, of course, happens in the \"Sugar and Rainbows\" Chapter, which leads to an intense confrontation between the two.\n\nI'm function, Vanille feels very \"White Magey\" in her proficient roles. She's proficient in Ravager, Medic and Saboteur, so she's clearly supposed to fulfil a support role in most party loadouts. Her Saboteur role proficiency could be a nod to her tendancy towards deception. It does end up being quite useful once maxed out, s Vanille gets access to the unique Death AP skill, which can even take out the monstrous adamantoise given the right setup. I tended to use Hope over Vanille when given the option in regular combat though; as I found his Synergist skills more useful than Vanille's Sabateur skills.\n\nWhile Vanille serves a crucial role towards the end of the story, I do admittedly find her less interesting when she doesn't have to grapple with living a lie. There's a poignant moment once the team makes landfall on Pulse, where Vanille laments to Hope that, by having to tell so many lies about who she is for protection's sake, she finds herself unsure which parts of her are lies and which ones are genuine articles. There's probably a lesson in there somewhere; that maybe remaining true to yourself benefits your mental above trying to save face by pretending to be someone you're not.\n\nSazh is fairly easily my favourite party member in the game. He's the second party member we encounter, being one of the prisoners on the train that Lightning derailed. Pretty awestruck by Lightning's performance, he follows her to her destination during the starting chapter, albeit begrudgingly. Once he's freed from imprisonment, his driving force is actually quite similar to that of Snow and Lightning's; though he's not interested in finding Sarah. Sazh wants to locate his son, Dajh, which serves as the primary drive for his actions throughout the story; he even keeps a chocobo chick in his hair that he wished to give his chocobo-obsessed son. It's following Lightning in hopes of finding his son that leaves him being unwittingly branded as a Pulse L'Cie.\n\nIt's in this twist of fate that a cruel irony hovers over Sazh throughout the story. See, as mentioned previously, Sazh has a clear hatred of Pulse. This somewhat stems from his exposure to Cocoon propaganda, but he also has personal stake in this, as he is lead to believe that Pulse was responsible for branding his son as a L'Cie. So having to run around, escaping capture as the very thing you had demonised, all the while being unsure if you'll ever reunited with your loved ones is probably a harrowing experience to say the least, and one we can clearly see haunts him.\n\nBut despite all that, Sazh is a profoundly kind man. For one he's a single father, one that would move mountains for his son. Throughout the story, he carries his single dad energy everywhere he goes, usually cracking jokes and serving as a grounding force in the party, while also being effective babysitter for the younger members of the party. He's the reluctant hero of the party, preferring to dodge conflict and prevent raising suspicion when possible; which puts him at odds with the bubbly and boisterous Vanille. However, Vanille and Sazh seem quickest to get along once the party gets separated. Giving it some thought, this makes sense; seeing as Vanille seems to have a good read on people and was likely able to suss out that Sazh was a gentle person. On Sazh's end, he has a natural affinity for children, being a father himself, so while he's often exasperated by Vanille's relentless, he's actually able to maintain good report with her throughout the initial chapters. Their interactions where often some of my favourites.\n\nHowever, it was their lowest point that ended up being my favourite moment in the game; the \"Sugar and Rainbows\" chapter. The chapter finds the two going through a chocobo-themed amusement park which, after indulging in some shenanigans, results in an encounter with Nabaat, a member of PSICOM (one of Cocoon's military forces), with Dajh in tow. The twist is that the focus given to Dajh when branded as a L'Cie was to locate the Pulse L'Cie, which he unwittingly fulfills when he embraces his father. This of course closes Dajh's focus, turning him into crystal before Sazh's eyes. Clearly in distress over this moment, this is when Nabaat drops the bombshell that, not only had she been using Dajh as effectively a Pulse L'Cie radar, but that Vanille and her sister, Fang, were the Pulse L'Cie responsible for his son being branded in the first place, robbing Vanille the opportunity to eventually disclose this herself.\n\nThis leads to a confrontation between the two. Here we have a man who has just lost his reason for going on, and the person responsible for that in front of him. Vanille, rought with guilt even offers her life as compensation. But even in the haze of grief, Sazh ultimately cannot bring himself to kill Vanille; she is just a child after all. The frustration of his inability to take any sort of action, all of his options seemingly closed off, is what ultimately causes an Eidolon to appear before him, which you defeat and Sazh claims as his own. However, following this, unable to find any other solution to his grief, Sazh puts a gun to his head, says \"No more\" and attempts to take his own life. Now I just want to say that the presentation of this scene was so effective, it legitimately made me forget that I had just gotten an entire gameplay function for Sazh like 5 minutes ago. I thought that was it for Sazh, my jaw was genuinely on the floor for like 10 minutes.\n\nSo obviously he's fine, he couldn't go through with it in the end. Cursing himself for not being able to take any action whatsoever, he decides all he can do is push forward and take up arms against the Cocoon Fal'Cie. Throughout the restvof the story, he holds onto the belief that there must be a way to save Dajh, much like how Snow holds out hope that there's a way to save Sarah. Honestly, I wish Sazh and Snow had more opportunities to connect over their lost loved ones. There are some character pairings that miss out on good interaction and this is one of the ones that sticks with me.\n\nI also can't help but be reminded of Wakka from Final Fantasy X when I think about Sazh. Both are comedic characters underlaid with tragedy involving the loss of lived one's and brainwashed into some form of propaganda into blaming that loss solely on a outside group, which leads overt hatred of that group. Then, due to circumstances, they are forced to work on the side of the group they were pitted against, before learning that they ultimately have the same goal in mind; they were just going about it in different ways. Ultimately, both are able to admit to their ignorance and hope to reconcile with a culture they have now been immersed in. One of my favourite things about playing these games is being able to connect the dots between some characters like this.\n\nSazh is one of those characters that gets blessed with proficiency in both Ravager and Commando classes, which makes quite good at both racking up stagger and dealing damage once the foe is staggered. Though Sazh is also proficient in the Synergist Role which, when coupled with Hope's own Synergist Role, could very quickly max out your buffs. My main core ended up being Lightning/Hope/Sazh for this reason.\n\nOne of my favourite archetypes of characters is the traditional comedy relief turned tragic character, and Sazh fits that mold quite well. He was always a joy to see and was center to some of the more evocative scenes in the game's story. He was a man who was really negatively impacted by the world's happenstance, and his fight to preserve the one sliver of peace and joy in his life made him a force really worth rooting for.\n\nI've left Fang, Vanille's older sister, for last because...well...she's the last party member you receive; and the only party member you get after everyone has been branded a Pulse L'Cie. This gives Fang some very clear hurdles she needs to clear in terms of being developed as a character. Whereas Snow was quite limited in his appearances once separated from the party, which lead to me not being able to get super attached to him early on; Fang is entirely absent as a party member until around 40% of the game in. This is well after the party has been separate and been reunited. In fact, she joins the party EXACTLY when the rest of the party reunites, which really adds an air of \"Oh hey I'm here too!\" to her introduction. She's also added to the party in a very chaotic moment in the story, so there isn't a whole lot of time to fully digest her addition before we got bigger fish to fry.\n\nBut I’m getting a bit ahead of myself; what exactly is Fang doing here? Well Vanille's concern for her sister is returned in kind, as she seems to be Fang's driving force foe her actions throughout the story. Without getting too much into it; the two were recently awakened from crystallised forms (allegedly following the completion for their last Pulse Focus). They're actually centuries old at this point and their crystals were dredged up with other Pulse scrappage during scavenging. The two awaken to find they have no memory of their Focus, as they weren't told anything following their awakening. Fearing Vanille becoming a Cie'th, Fang frantically searches for an answer to what their Focus could be. Somewhere along the line, Fang and Vanille get separated, which is how Vanille ends up with Hope.\n\nSo Vanille's mission throughout the early parts of the game is to reunite with her sister, whereas we don't get much information on what Fang is doing until after she joins the party. She's clearly supposed to be a sort of \"surprise\" party member intended to be shrouded in mystery. The whole \"I can't remember my purpose\" deal really sells that for me.\n\nIf I had to describe Fang as a character, I supposed it would be that she's a more grizzled Lightning. While Lightning was Stoic, cool headed and pragmatic, she still maintained a strong sense of nurturing and humanity, especially towards when it came to those younger than her. Fang is similarly rugged but also throws in some sarcasm for good measure. What sets them apart is the fact that Fang's softer side seems reserved EXCLUSIVELY for her younger sister Vanille. She has no love for Cocoon, but will work with the other Fal'cie if it means finding an answer to save her sister. She is actually quite a sharp contrast to Vanille; Vanille is bubbly, naive and trusting, while Fang is no-nonsense, gruff and immediately apprehensive of everyone. Interestingly, while Vanille has manages to wrap herself in an inescapable veil of lies, Fang makes no illusions of what she is when asked; probably because she's strong enough to deal with the consequences of being so open.\n\nThis, combined with her relatively late addition, does make it rather difficult to endear myself to Fang admittedly. There's not much to latch onto for a solid chunk of the game other than \"She's important to Vanille so she's important by-proxy\". She does serve as a solid exposition machine on all things Pulse, and it is admittedly funny watching Sazh have to tiptoe around badmouthing Pulse while she's around. She also does get more interesting once we get some insight into Vanille and Fang's past. See, back in their day, they were originally given the role of becoming Ragnarok, a monstrous entity of fire and brimstone, to destroy Cocoon. Though they were both given this role, it was Fang alone who became Ragnarok, and they were both crystallised after tearing a big hole into Cocoon.\n\nThe interesting revelation is that Vanille had known all along since awakening that her Focus was to become Ragnarok. You can actually tell something is up as early back as when the party gets branded as L'Cie, as it is Vanille who correctly identifies the figure in their vision as Ragnarok; which she wouldn't know unless she was there. When Fang confronts Vanille about this, she lies and says it was her who became Ragnarok all those years ago, likely to spare her the hassle of becoming it again. In quite a funny twist, Fang exploits the mechanisms of the Eidolon's appearances to trick Vanille into telling the truth. It was well established at this point that the Eidolon only show up during a point of internal turmoil for the L'Cie. So when Fang bluffs to Vanille and says that she remembered her Focus and that she needs to know the truth, the inner turmoil of Vanille's secret calls forth an Eidolon for them fight, essentially serving as Fang's confirmation that Vanille had been lying. It's a legitimately cool worldbuilding moment. And then of course they reconcile and compromise to protect each other rather than it being one-sided.\n\nHowever, once Fang rediscovers that it was her that became Ragnarok in the past, it only strengthens her resolve to do it again to preserve Vanille's life. So of course we have yet another character who is perfectly willing to throw away their life for the sake of someone else; may as well just call the party the Suicide Squad at this point.\n\nYou've probably noticed by now that a lot of my discussion on Fang has mostly touched on her relationship with Vanille, and that brings to light the biggest issue with Fang for me personally. Her character is so laser focused on what she can do im service to Vanille that, once you take that way from her, there isn't really much of her narrative left to talk about. And comparing her to Vanille, a victim of the same circumstance as her really does touch on why. Vanille was introduced early, so she was afforded more time to develop and was present for that crucial ice-breaking section of the game with Sazh where she could actually develop some relationships. And funny enough, they COULD have done this with Fang too; tithe first time we see Fang, she is with Snow after he had been captured early game defending Sarah's crystal. We could have had one or two chapters where Fang and Snow were teamed up.\n\nAlthough this would make sense narratively, it likely wouldn't have worked in practice, which is probably why they didn't bother. Fang is proficient as a Sentinel, Commando and Saboteur, while Snow works as a Sentinel, Ravager and Commander. The complete lack of a Medic role among them, on top of two Sentinels would have likely made for a very dull experience. I do wish Fang got some opportunities to explore her character more though; she has a cool design and she's clearly modeled after dragoons.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII got a lot of flack on release for it's linearity and it's departure from a lot of conventions. But having played it myself, I think the game is perfectly reasonable I'm what it is trying to do. It's clearly not trying to be a traditional Final Fantasy game, this much is evident in the lack of a level system, lack of traditional jobs and the gameplay itself. Final Fantasy has been trying to move away from traditional turn based combat for as far back as FFVI (I think that's where the atb system was introduced.) And you can definitely see the couples starting to break with this one. While there is certainly still strategy involved in this gameplay, it's clearly designed to be a spectacle above all else. They want the story to be spectacular, the want the characters to be spectacular and they want to gameplay to be spectacular. And for what it's worth, I think it did a pretty decent job at achieving that goal. I think I'd place this at a solid A-Tier. While the gameplay does become a bit of a slog towards the end, it's no doubt a pretty as hell slog, the characters were evocative enough to me that I got invested in their story. Final Fantasy XIII gets a low A-Tier rating from me, which is a hell of a lot higher than what I was expecting going off of vibes online.\n\nI probably won’t touch the next two FFXIII games until after I play through the series, as I hear the Steam Ports are pretty poor and we’re supposedly getting a trilogy remaster somewhere down the line. But until next time!"
