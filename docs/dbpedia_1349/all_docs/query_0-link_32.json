I've spent months writing on this article, trying to articulate the good and bad, and I'd love to hear your thoughts: https://arjenartdesign.blogspot.com/2020/06/some-thoughts-about-final-fantasy-13-2.html I know it's very long, so if you want a tl;dr: - Gameplay is an improvement in every way (except the QTEs). Combat is faster, more streamlined and more customizable and exploration is more open and free.",
