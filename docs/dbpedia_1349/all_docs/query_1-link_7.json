        "text": "I feel like it should have had the same impact as Tidus's death in FFX, in some ways it was even more dramatic and it was just as unexpected. But seriously?\n\nlol DAT ENDING. I was spoiled way before FFXIII-2 and got all my good rage out before I got the game. I think a lot of that ending was just executed badly, X was made bittersweet, XIII-2 was suppose to shock and confuse the audience. Oh also, most inappropriate music ever.\n\nWhen I first saw the ending my guess was that they were setting up for part II of the Etros story. Since a lot of the mythology was actually about the world of the dead, and now that Serah and her mog weapon are gone, and the Valhalla gates are spewing crap into the world, the other gods would start making their appearance. I mean, didn't the original game show that at least Pulse was still somewhat active. And even if the fal'cie are dormant, they were kind of made for the purpose of finding their way to the invisible world... kinda. So... plan achieved I guess. This is what the plan was for, right? So now it's like the Fal'cie Strikes Back?\n\nBut apparently Lightning's story is coming out on dlc instead of an actual full game so that kind of negates them. Although I'm not really against it, Lightning turning into a statue is the thing I just don't understand at all.\n\nI mean, a lot of things are pretty poorly explained, but I can at least understand most of them. Lightning on Etros throne, I don't even. And it took me awhile to struggle through some of the holes in Caius' plan (if he could kill Etros by stabbing his heart... then why didn't he stab himself in the heart? That way it couldn't flow into a new guardian. WHY DID NO ONE TELL SERAH AND NOEL DIRECTLY THAT IT WOULD DESTROY THE WORD... well Caius did sorta. If history already ended at that time what's the point of destroying time because Yuel would stop being reborn anyway. And if she was, there would be no history to see, the paradox ending shows that. Also Academia knew that the Cocoon would fall eventually, my god why would you build a city there. And you can float the godamn moon, you can't build support structures?)\n\nActually it's kind of interesting that something that's suppose to be shocking was laid out plain during the game. It's revealed Serah will die if she continues to screw with the timeline. Caius tells Noel that destroying his heart would kill Etros (he says again so maybe she'll pop right back up?) I don't know if you can find it before you finish the game, but in Bohdum 700, you find letters from Serah and Noel basically saying BAD SHIT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nThat said, cgi ending aside, when I played, I found the Caius and Noel fight a lot more compelling. Caius raging at Noel about the death of the Yuels was surprisingly sad.\n\nAlso, Final Fantasy XIII main characters have a bad habit of accidentally breaking the world. They should try and stop doing that.\n\nSo much to quote and respond to!\n\nAlso wanted to add that a few things I liked that I've seen people bitching about: -\n\n1. The Historia Crux theme (not the crazy chanting part, but the first couple of minutes I really enjoy!)\n\n2. The Rambunctious Chocobo theme: Fits really well with those chocobos. I'm not into that style of music anymore but every time I hop onto one of those Gysahl junkie birds it gives me chuckles.\n\n3. The story. Is it just me, or is every reviewer totally blowing it out of proportion? I know in places it's contrived, but ffs, has there ever been a FF that doesn't have a completely contrived plot? I met a friend for coffee today and when she asked about XIII-2's story, I attempted to explain it and we ended up laughing for about 20 minutes. Of course it's contrived, its FUCKING FINAL FANTASY. I still thought it was great (plot holes notwithstanding).\n\n@ Aradia - No, I wasn't expecting Serah's death. At all. I suppose it wasn't really a twist so much as following the plot the game set up (for once, cheap dig haha), but that in itself was a huge twist, you know?\n\nWhat was I expecting? How about seeing SERAH AND LIGHTNING REUNITED FOREVER!? Serah's entire motive is to get to Lightning, and it just isn't fulfilled. Slight rage at that. I mean, I know they have a conversation but meh.\n\nSplintered said:\n\nI don't know if you can find it before you finish the game, but in Bohdum 700, you find letters from Serah and Noel basically saying BAD SHIT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nYou need the paradox scope to pick those up, and you can only get that by completing the game. I think Serah's message in that example is an acceptance of death, yes, but more likely I don't actually think she's dead.\n\nWhat I can't work out is whether the timing makes a difference. If she died in Valhalla (when the world became valhalla) then she's not really dead. But she died before that happened, so she might ACTUALLY be dead. Oddness.\n\nAnd I agree about the crazy building a new cocoon thing... why the hell didn't they just float the old one instead?\n\nAlso, WHY WAS THERE NO CONFRONTATION OF ALYSSA AND HER EVIL ASSNESS. I was all geared up for some betrayal melodrama when I first went to Academia 500AF and there was just no payoff. But she faded into nothingness because originally she never survived the original purge... or something. Contrived plot, moving on.\n\nsplintered said:\n\nAlso, Final Fantasy XIII main characters have a bad habit of accidentally breaking the world. They should try and stop doing that.\n\nI had to quote this, because it's awesome and made me laugh even though I'm really really tired.\n\nSplintered said:\n\nBut apparently Lightning's story is coming out on dlc instead of an actual full game so that kind of negates them. Although I'm not really against it, Lightning turning into a statue is the thing I just don't understand at all.\n\nI have the collector's edition guide, which sheds some light on this (it has an exclusive interview with Toriyama who explains a few things). Well, it's actually quite vague, but what it says is:\n\nQ: Is there a meaning to the throne of Etro that is seen at various moments in the void beyond?\n\nA: The throne of Etro is empty for most of the game. This symbolises the ever diminishing power of Etro. However, in the ending Lightning sits atop the throne. This symbolises the world's existence relies on her to embody the divine will. As Lightning wants to maintain hope, she enters crystal stasis in order to protect the will of her sacrified sister, Serah. We are planning a DLC release to reveal the background to this.\n\nBTW, I'm assuming someone's already done this, but since the interview is only in the limited edition version I'd be happy to put up scans or type up a transcript if anyone cares enough to want to read it. Tomorrow, right now my body just wants to collapse onto my comfortable bed and forget that ending.\n\nAnother thing (of all the stuff below) that I don't understand: If Caius wished to kill Etro, why is his theme song basically a love-song-commitment to her (without revealing her name of course)?\n\nAlso, is it only me that questions when 'the goddess' is mentioned, do they really mean Etro or could they mean Muin (or both)?\n\nam i the only one who liked the crazy chanting in the historia crux song\n\ni know she's going TIME AND SPACE TIME AND SPACE TIME AND SPACE\n\nbut i just like it\n\n^ I absolutely love the Historia Crux song too. Sometimes I just stay there just to hear it XD\n\nSame. I love the song too. Bad thing is, it's was stuck in my head for days. It's not good when one is in class and suddenly 'Time and space, time and space, time and space!\" comes lowly rolling through one's thoughts.\n\nI finished the game three days ago and I still can't get over the ending. Everything is so MESSED UP. It's not even funny. I mean, seriously? Serah dies, Lightning is crystalized, Chaos eats the world. Just, what the hell.\n\nI absolutely love the game, but I want a solid ending for this story already :/ especially because I just can't and refuse to deal with Serah dying. Just no.\n\nI can live with a bad ending, it's just this bad ending leaves so many questions unanswered. A few things: I would like to have explained more about Etro and the heart of the guardian. Was Etro or a piece of her that could still exist in the physical realm actually living inside the guardian? Was this 'heart of Etro' passed down from Etro from Muin before she died? Was Etro's powers indeed descended from Muin when Muin charged Etro with keeping the balance of the cosmos?\n\nNow, please don't hate me, but I can live with Serah dying, I can live with Lightning having to remain in Valhalla, I can live with Snow being off and may never return... It would be hard, it would be sad - but I can live with this (maybe because I guess none of the characters really evoked any sort of connection with me, nothing pulled at my heart strings so much and nothing really struck me as important). What I find hard to live with is that the whole world is destroyed. I find it hard to believe that - after everything, which personally I think was part of the problem to begin with (everyone who was messing with the timeline by even trans-versing the timeline!), basically the same thing happens, but at a faster rate and more devastating degree.\n\nWould I be wrong if I admitted my thoughts that I would like to see and learn more about Buniberzei and Pulse and Lindzei, as well as Muin and Etro, and their respective sides? I can't help but the Arbiter of Time in the Coliseum was basically alluding to Buniberzei's plans to destroy the spirit of his mother. I would also like to learn more about why he hates his mother so much, and would like to learn her side of things too. This part of the storyline makes me think of -not sure about the country(ies?) of origin- Sumerian (?) mythology of Tiamat (female dragon mother of the gods) who was defeated by her son... I forget his name (Mar(ma?)duk). (Can you tell I like mythology/legends?)\n\nI can live with a bad ending, it's just this bad ending leaves so many questions unanswered.

It's not just the fact that it's a sad/bad ending, it's because it left a lot of stuff just floating in the air, without a clear answer. I still don't understand why a lot of stuff happened and it feels incomplete. So basically, while I hate what they did to both Serah and Light, the fact that it feels so incomplete is what bothers me the most. Also, what about Noel? His mere existence is pretty much a paradox, why didn't anything happen to him? (Not that I'd like to, I love him, but you get what I mean XD)\n\nDon't worry, I understand :3 even though I don't agree since I personally have connected a lot to the characters in this game. Serah and Noel especially, and I can't believe that, after everything they went through, after Serah even sacrificed herself, the world ended up being destroyed. Just... Ugh.\n\nI'd love to see more of it too! XIII has one of the richest mythologies in the series. There are LOTS of possibilities."
