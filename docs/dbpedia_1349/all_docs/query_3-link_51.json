Don't just passively read them, in one ear and out the other! Think about how these definitions relate to demonic activity in your life as a follower of Christ. Try to put some of these definitions in the description of schemes in Ephesians 6:11+ to help you meditate on important truth.\n\nDefinition = a plan of action, an elaborate and systematic plan for a course of action designed to achieve a major or overall aim; a strategy (art of planning and directing overall military operations and movements in a war or battle); a secret or underhanded plan; a plot or a plan to achieve some action; a carefully arranged and systematic program of action for attaining some object or end; a particular ordered system or arrangement; a large-scale systematic plan or arrangement for attaining some particular object or putting a particular idea into effect. Synonyms: plan, project, plan of action, program, strategy, stratagem, tactic, game plan, master plan, course/line of action.\n\nEtymology of scheme - It is from Medieval Latin schema which means shape, figure, form, appearance and is from Greek schema which refers to appearance, as opposed to reality. This is a good description of the devil, the master deceiver, the master masquerader! Don't look for him in a red suit, with horns and a pitchfork, but as an angel of light (2Cor 11:14+!\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nSee article below by Puritan Thomas Brooks on Satan's Devices to Draw the Soul to Sin (and 12 remedies).\n\nSee links to the answers to 38 Questions on Satan\n\nSchemes of the devil - Here we encounter the commander in chief of the invisible army arrayed against us. He is our sworn, mortal enemy. This is not a video game or a fairy tale but a very real war with a very real, deceptive foe.\n\nPaul had warned about the devil's schemes to disrupt the unity of the body writing that \"As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming.\" (Ep 4:14-note)\n\nThe schemes of the devil - Note Paul's use of the definite article in Greek (\"THE schemes\") which defines these as specific schemes, not just general schemes. It suggests that the devil and his minions have specific schemes, \"tailor made\" for each person, for he is aware of the sin that so easily entangles each of us (Hebrews 12:1+)! Note that these schemes involve shrewdly devious and intriguing methods that entail following an orderly, technical procedure in the handling of a subject. Schemes is used to describe a wild animal cunningly stalking and unexpectedly pouncing on prey (cp 1Pe 5:8+). Satan’s schemes to destroy us and do us harm are built around stealth and deception but as Paul writes to the Corinthians \"we are not ignorant of his schemes.\" (2 Corinthians 2:11+) In 2 Corinthians 2:11+ the word schemes is not methodeia but noema [from nous = mind] and refers to the content of thinking and reasoning.\n\n\"Satan is only God’s master fencer to teach us to use our weapons.\"\n\n-- Samuel Rutherford\n\nSchemes (3180) (methodeia from methodeuo = to work by method in turn from meta = with, after + hodos = a way) refers to an orderly, logical, effective arrangement, usually in steps followed to achieve an end. It describes deliberate planning or a systematic approach and can have a positive or negative connotation. The negative meaning of methodeia implies the use of clever methods or strategies to attain the desired end. The Scripture always uses methodeia with a negative connotation.\n\nMethodeia has reference to planned, subtle, systematized error. Error organizes. It has its systems and its logic. Be alert! Be mature! Satan’s scheming, crafty actions and artful designs have ‘method’ and purpose, for his aim is to mislead the immature who are not grounded on apostolic doctrine. Behind the evil men and women who seek to expound false teaching, there is also a supernatural evil power who seeks to deceive unwary saints with his \"devilish\" cunning.\n\nThink about this simple definition in the context of spiritual warfare. Satan is orderly and logical in his steps employed against you to achieve his nefarious purposes. This realization should prompt each of us to be even more appreciative of the fact that we cannot stand against our invisible enemy in our own intelligence, our own strength or our own human \"methods\" or \"schemes\". We must put on the full armor that God supplies in Christ.\n\nAs alluded to above, the negative connotation of methodeia implies the use of cleverness, craftiness, cunning and deception. The \"deceiver\" uses specific, subtle, stealthy plans to target each individual, his goal being to defeat, discourage and dishearten. Stated another way, Satan's attacks are \"tailor made\" (\"the schemes\"), carefully and methodically selected to attack each person's specific weaknesses and vulnerabilities. His wiles and methods are usually attractive, always deceptive, and often ensnaring. Stay sober and alert!\n\nSpurgeon has the following cautions regarding our Adversary, the devil writing that \"He will attack you sometimes by force and sometimes by fraud. By might or by sleight he will seek to overcome you, and no unarmed man can stand against him. Never go out without all your armor on, for you can never tell where you may meet the devil. He is not omnipresent, but nobody can tell where he is not, for he and his troops of devils appear to be found everywhere on this earth.\"\n\nPuritan Thomas Watson wrote that \"Satan tempts after some discoveries of God’s love. As a pirate sets on a ship that is richly laden, so when a soul hath been laden with spiritual comforts the devil will be shooting at him, to rob him of all. The devil envies to see a soul feasted with spiritual joy.\"\n\nDavid Jeremiah has an interesting thought on Satan's methodeia writing that...\n\nIf you could sneak into Satan’s office, wherever that might be (he’s not in hell yet), and take a peek into his files, you might be surprised to find a file folder with your name on it. I’m not exaggerating. He keeps a file on you, and inside that file are all the strategies he’s tried on you—the ones that have worked and the ones that have failed. He doesn’t waste his time with the ones that don’t work anymore. Instead, he uses variations on the strategies that have caused you to stumble in the past. As long as they keep working, he keeps using them. Somewhere in that file cabinet there’s a file labeled: Jeremiah, David. In this file, I wouldn’t be surprised at all if there was a notation that reads something like this: Subject may be prone to discouragement, especially if he becomes overly weary. This has worked several times before and seems a promising method of attack. Suggestion: Make sure he stays very busy, overcommitted, and physically tired. At all costs, keep him from extended times of Bible reading and prayer.\n\nSo what is Satan’s strategy for me? He looks for ways to discourage me, and if possible, cause me some depression. He will use whatever people, means, or circumstances it takes to achieve his goal.\n\nIt’s the same for you. Maybe your file says, “Frequently tempted to gossip,” or “quick temper,” or “prone to coveting and jealousy,” or “weak in the area of lust.”\n\nDon’t kid yourself, he knows very well where your vulnerabilities lie. It’s all in his file. You’ve heard, perhaps, that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. That’s very good news, but it is also true that Satan hates you and has a plan and strategy to destroy your walk with Jesus Christ.\n\nThat’s one big reason why you experience struggle and discouragement in your Christian experience. Sometimes I hear people say,\n\n“Well, if you’re a Christian, you shouldn’t have any struggles. You shouldn’t ever feel discouraged. All is peace and joy and love and happiness.”\n\nI don’t think so. I personally think that description fits better with life before you found salvation in Christ. Do you know why? Because you only had one influence in your life at that time. There was no contest for your heart. There was no tug-of-war for your soul. (Borrow this book God In You: Releasing the Power of the Holy Spirit in Your Life. See 174 ratings)\n\nMethodeia is translated with a number of words as shown in the list below with each word followed by a definition. As you read through this list think about how each describes your mortal foe, the devil.\n\nCraftiness - adept in the use of subtlety and cunning. No place in Scripture reveals Satan’s schemes better than Genesis 3, which records Satan’s initial contact with man.\n\nCunning - characterized by wiliness and trickery. It describes the faculty of executing well what one has devised.\n\nScheming - given to making plots; shrewdly devious and intriguing. Synonyms include artful, calculating, conniving, cunning, deceitful, designing, duplicitous, foxy, Machiavellian, slippery, sly, tricky, underhand, wily.\n\nStrategies - careful plans or methods. Strategy can also refer to the art or science of the planning and conduct of a war. The Columbia Encyclopedia notes that \"strategy and tactics, in warfare are related terms referring, respectively, to large-scale and small-scale planning to achieve military success. Strategy may be defined as the general scheme of the conduct of a war, tactics as the planning of means to achieve strategic objectives. Synonyms for strategy include: blueprint, design, game plan, project, scheme.\n\nStratagems - an artifice or trick in war for deceiving and outwitting the enemy. A cleverly contrived trick or scheme for gaining an end. Stratagem implies a ruse used to entrap, outwit, circumvent, or surprise an opponent or enemy.\n\nTactics - The derivation of the word tactic is very interesting and gives us some insight into the meaning of the devil's methods. The word \"tactics\" is from the Greek word taktikos which means \"of order, of tactics, fit for arranging\" and which in turn is derived from \"tassein\" which means to arrange or place in battle formation. Tactics is defined then as the science and art of disposing and maneuvering forces in combat. It refers to the art or skill of employing available means to accomplish an end. In short, the tactics of the devil are calculated plans specifically designed to bring the downfall of God’s people and His kingdom.\n\nTrickery - the practice of crafty underhanded ingenuity to deceive or cheat. It implies ingenious acts intended to dupe or cheat.\n\nWiles - tricks or strategy carried out with the intent to entice, ensnare or deceive. Wiles suggests an attempt to entrap or deceive with false allurements. In short they are attractive!\n\nFriberg states that methodeia can have a neutral or positive meaning referring simply to a \"method or procedure (but) in the NT (is used) in a bad sense, (and refers to) scheming to deceive, craftiness, cunning, deception (see notes Ephesians 4:14); In the plural (as used in Ephesians 6:11) methodeia can refer to stratagems, cunning attacks, tricks\" (Adapted from Friberg, T. - borrow Analytical Lexicon of the Greek New Testament)\n\nJohn MacArthur writes that methodeia (\"wiles\") conveys 'the idea of cleverness, crafty methods, cunning, and deception. Satan’s schemes are propagated through the evil world system over which he rules, and are carried out by his demon hosts. “Wiles” is all-inclusive, encompassing every sin, immoral practice, false theology, false religion, and worldly enticement.\" (Borrow The MacArthur Study Bible)\n\nThe Theological Dictionary of the New Testament has the following note on methodeia specifically commenting on its use in Ephesians 6:11 \"The reference is to machinations or (in military terms) attacks against which one must be armed. The nature of the attacks (the plural suggests that they are constantly repeated or are of incalculable variety) constitutes their great danger, against which the armour of God is the only defence. They are distinguished not so much by technique or strategy as by refinement and insidiousness (Vulgate translates insidiae, Luther “cunning attacks,” A.V. “wiles”)\" (Borrow Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the New Testament : abridged in one volume)\n\nThe only other use of methodeia is in Ephesians 4:14 where as a result of being equipped and growing in maturity, the saints \"are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness (methodeia) in deceitful scheming.\" (Eph 4:14+)\n\nThe KJV has a picturesque rendering of Ephesians 4:14 stating that \"they lie in wait (methodeia) to deceive.\"\n\nKenneth Wuest writes that \"methodeia\" is derived \"from the verbal form methodeuo “to follow up or investigate by method and settled plan, to follow craftily, frame devices, deceive.” Methodeia was used to describe a wild animal who cunningly stalked and unexpectedly pounced on its prey, a vivid depiction of the Adversary's \"methods\" against believers. Satan’s schemes are propagated through the evil world system over which he rules, and are carried out by his demon hosts. “Wiles” is all-inclusive, encompassing every sin, immoral practice, false theology, false religion, and worldly enticement. Methodeia is a Greek word that denotes a path or roadway that is traveled over. This is because the devil continuously attempts to secure a foothold so that he may begin construction of a roadway to your mind.\" (Wuest Word Studies - Eerdman Publishing Company Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3 - used by permission)\n\nMarvin Vincent adds that \"methodeia means a deliberate planning or system.\"\n\nAlbert Barnes writes that \"methodeia means properly that which is traced out with “method;” that which is “methodized;” and then that which is well laid - art, skill, cunning.\" (Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible)\n\nRay Stedman in his excellent book Spiritual Warfare has this note regarding \"methodeia\":\n\n\"What are the tactics the devil employs? He destroys by deceiving, by lying, by distorting, by counterfeiting, by masquerading, by clouding human minds with illusion and fantasy. This is what Paul calls \"the devil's schemes,\" or as some translations put it, \"the wiles of the devil\" Read through the Bible and see how many times the work of the devil is referred to in that manner - the snares and the traps of the devil, the lies and illusions, the stratagems and the wiles. That is why we must look closely at the tactics the devil uses against us so that we can be strong and well-defended when he comes to us to defeat us, weaken us, and ruin our lives....\n\nBy far, the majority of attacks of the devil against Christians are not direct but indirect. That is why they are called the \"schemes\" of the devil. Schemes suggest deviousness or acting in a way that is subtle, secretive, and treacherous.\n\nWe need to examine this more thoroughly, for the major attack of the devil and his powers against human life is not by direct means, but indirectly by satanic suggestions through the natural and commonplace situations of life ( for more in depth discussion)...\n\nSo we have an enormous responsibility before God and before the entire world to give ourselves, body and soul, to this great battle against the schemes of the evil one. We have a responsibility to battle the schemes of the devil in this world, and to point the way to the peace and security that lies ahead of us in the world to come...most often the devil comes in disguise, through the channel of \"the flesh\" our inner selves with silken, subtle, suggestive schemes. That is the avenue of satanic attack the apostle Paul warns us most strenuously about: the subtle schemes of the devil.\" (Spiritual Warfare -- recommended) (Bolding added)\n\nStedman goes on to write \"Friend, in Christ there is nothing that more clearly indicates that we have succumbed to the schemes of the devil than to complain about our lot in life. Again and again, the Word of God shows that the mark of a Christian who has learned how to be a Christian is that he rejoices in everything and gives thanks in all things.\" (Ed: Only possible for one continually filled with the Spirit Eph 5:18+) (Spiritual Warfare) (Bolding added)\n\nMurphy writes that \"The idea behind methodeia is deception. The apostle is warning us that the devil’s entire system of warfare against us is based on deception. He fights not on a pitched field, but by sudden assault and secret and cunning onslaught.\" (Murphy, E. F. Handbook for Spiritual Warfare. Nashville: Thomas Nelson)\n\nEadie in his classic commentary on Ephesians adds that \"The great enemy of man, a veteran fierce and malignant, has a method of warfare peculiar to himself, for it consists of “wiles.” His battles are the rush of a sudden ambuscade (ambush). He fights not on a pitched field, but by sudden assault and secret and cunning onslaught. Vigilance, self-possession, and promptitude are therefore indispensable to meet him: and as his aim is to throw his opponents off their guard and then to surprise them, so there is need to be ever clothed in this complete armour of God. His “wiles” are seen in unsettling the mind of Eve by representing God as jealous of the first man and woman; in stirring up the warlike aspirations of David to take a military census and force a conscription as the basis of a standing army; in inflaming the avaricious and sordid spirit of Judas; and in his assaults on our Lord by an appeal to appetite, piety, and ambition.\" (John Eadie, D., LL.D. The Epistle of St Paul to the Ephesians)\n\nOswald Chambers has a good word about the methodeia of the devil writing that \"We cannot stand against the wiles of the devil by our wits. The devil only comes along the line that God understands, not along the lines we understand, and the only way we can be prepared for him is to do what God tells us, stand complete in his armor, indwelt by His Spirit, in complete obedience to Him.\" (Oswald Chambers 1874–1917)\n\nJonathan Edwards wrote that \"the best protection one can have from the devil and his schemes is a humble heart.\"\n\nJames Burns writes that \"The danger of listening to the voice of the Tempter, and the subtlety by which he accomplishes his wiles, is illustrated by R. Spencer Stanhope in a picture in the Manchester Art Gallery, entitled “Eve.” In it he represents the Serpent whispering in her ear while she listening, plays with the sin within her mind. At the same time, unseen by her, he bends a branch of the tree with a coil of his body, and lo! as she dallies with the sin in her mind, an apple drops into her open hand. When the temptation has once been permitted to enter, the means of gratifying it is at hand.\" (Tan, P. L. Encyclopedia of 7700 illustrations)\n\nMacDonald warns that \"the devil has various stratagems—discouragement, frustration, confusion, moral failure and doctrinal error. He knows our weakest point and aims for it. If he cannot disable us by one method, he will try for another....Most serious of all is the danger of deception. Those who are babes are unskillful in the word of righteousness, their senses are not exercised to discern between good and evil (Heb. 5:13, 14). They inevitably meet some false cultist who impresses them by his zeal and apparent sincerity. Because he uses religious words, they think he must be a true Christian. If they had studied the Bible for themselves, they would be able to see through his deceitful juggling of words. But now they are carried about by his wind of doctrine and led by unprincipled cunning into a form of systematized error. (Borrow Believer's Bible Commentary - an excellent 1 volume commentary on entire Bible)\n\nThe Open Bible defines our Adversary's \"schemes\" as \"superhuman craftiness, capable of drawing careless Christians into sin.\"\n\nWarren Wiersbe writes that \"The danger on the battlefield is that we do not take the enemy seriously and therefore fail to put on all of the armor. By faith, you put on the armor through prayer, which must be done at the beginning of every day. Never underestimate the strategy and strength of the devil.\" (Borrow With the Word : The Chapter-by-Chapter Bible Handbook)\n\nSeldom does Satan ever attack openly with an overt frontal assault (and by the way most of us will probably never be attacked by Satan himself as he is a finite not omnipresent being. But he does command a host of fallen angels who share his evil design for mankind). In contrast, Satan's Schemes are nearly always unseen, shrewd, and perfectly tailored to ensnare his victim like a fowler camouflaging his net to trap a bird (\"methodical\"). \"Schemes, wiles and methods\" speak of the trickery and subterfuge by which evil and temptation present themselves in our lives. Evil rarely looks evil until it accomplishes its goal. It gains entrance by appearing attractive, desirable, and perfectly legitimate. But to reiterate it is a baited and camouflaged trap. As Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 11:14+, Satan masquerades as an angel of light.\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nThe Deceitfulness of Sin - equivalent to 80+ page booklet on killing sin, etc\n\nKilling the Amalekites - a picture of fighting our fallen flesh\n\nA SUMMARY OF THE \"METHODEIA\"\n\nOF SATAN, OUR ADVERSARY, THE DEVIL\n\nGod's Word teaches that Satan, our relentless, determined Adversary, the Devil, carries out the following with great craft and cunning (and even this long list is not exhaustive!)\n\n(1) ACCUSES\n\nJob 1:6-11 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. 7 And the LORD said to Satan, \"From where do you come?\" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, \"From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.\" 8 And the LORD said to Satan, \"Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.\" 9 Then Satan answered the LORD, \"Does Job fear God for nothing? 10 \"Hast Thou not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.11 \"But put forth Thy hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse Thee to Thy face.\"\n\nJob 2:1-7 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD. 2 And the LORD said to Satan, \"Where have you come from?\" Then Satan answered the LORD and said, \"From roaming about on the earth, and walking around on it.\" 3 And the LORD said to Satan, \"Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to ruin him without cause.\" 4 And Satan answered the LORD and said, \"Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. 5 \"However, put forth Thy hand, now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse Thee to Thy face.\" 6 So the LORD said to Satan, \"Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life.\" 7 Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.\n\nZechariah 3:1-2 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse (Hebrew = satan!) him. 2 And the LORD said to Satan, \"The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\"\n\nRevelation 12:10-11 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, \"Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser (kategoros - one who speaks openly against, to condemn or accuse mainly in a legal sense) of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night. 11 \"And they overcame (nikao = get the victory, conquer, prevail, \"Nike missile\") him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even to death. (Rev 12:10-11+)\n\n(2) AFFLICTS\n\nJob 1:12-19 Then the LORD said to Satan, \"Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.\" So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD. 13 Now it happened on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, 14 that a messenger came to Job and said, \"The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, 15 and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also slew the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.\" 16 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, \"The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.\" 17 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, \"The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.\" 18 While he was still speaking, another also came and said, \"Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, 19 and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died; and I alone have escaped to tell you.\"\n\nJob 2:6-7 So the LORD said to Satan, \"Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life.\"7 Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.\n\nLuke 13:16+ \"And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?\"\n\nRevelation 2:10+ 'Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.\n\n(3) CONQUERS\n\nNote: Remember that \"in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him Who loved us.\" (NKJV, Ro 8:37+)\n\nActs 10:38+ \"You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed (katadunasteuo = to tyrannize, rule over as a potentate, oppress harshly, exercise dominion against) by the devil; for God was with Him.\n\nEphesians 6:16+; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one.\n\n2 Timothy 2:25-26+ (The Lord's bondservant) with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, 26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will. (Comment: Note what sets the captive free - The Truth. The struggle is not a power struggle but a truth struggle!)\n\n(4) DECEIVES\n\nGenesis 3:1-6,13+ Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, \"Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?\" 2 And the woman said to the serpent, \"From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3 but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it, lest you die.'\" 4 And the serpent said to the woman, \"You surely shall not die! 5 \"For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\" 6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate...13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, \"What is this you have done?\" And the woman said, \"The serpent deceived (beguiled, led astray, deluded, seduced) me, and I ate.\" (cf 1Ti 2:14 And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being quite deceived (seduced into error, enticed into sin), fell into transgression.)\n\nJohn 8:44+ \"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning (see Genesis 3:1-6,13+), and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature; for he is a liar, and the father of lies. (Comment: Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote, “Sin has many tools, but a lie is the handle which fits them all.”)\n\nActs 13:10+ (Saul known as Paul filled with the Holy Spirit spoke to Elymas the magician who was opposing the apostles) and said, \"You who are full of all deceit (dolos = deliberate attempt to mislead other people by telling lies, duplicity, deliberate dishonesty, deceitful cunning) and fraud (recklessness, malignity, mischief, intrigue, unscrupulousness), you son of the devil, (in Acts 13:6 he is called \"Bar-Jesus\" = son of Jesus or son of Joshua! cf 2Cor 11:13-15 below) you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord?\n\n2 Corinthians 4:3-4+ And even if our gospel is veiled (kalupto = covered over and hence not visible), it is veiled to those who are perishing (apollumi = pertains to destruction but not annihilation, to that which is ruined and is no longer usable for its intended purpose), 4 in whose case the god of this world (aion) (cf 1John 5:19+) has blinded (tuphloo - cf use in 1John 2:11+) the minds of the unbelieving (note that this speaks of their rejection of the light of the gospel which leaves only one alternative, the darkness of unbelief!), that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, Who is the image of God.\n\n2 Corinthians 11:13-15+ For such men (those who were boasting that their work was like Paul's and the real apostles) are false apostles (pseudapostolos), deceitful (dolios - guile filled, from dolos = one who deliberately attempt to mislead by telling lies with desire to gain advantage or preserve position) workers, disguising (metaschematizo from metá = change of place or condition + schematízo = change outward form without a change in the internal character as in metamorphoo = transfigure, transform, the outward here being truly representative of the inward nature) themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises (metaschematizo) himself as an angel of light. 15 Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise (metaschematizo) themselves as servants of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their deeds. (WHAT'S THE \"KEY WORD\" IN THESE 3 VERSES THAT DESCRIBES A PRIMARY SCHEME OF THE DEVIL?)\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8-10+ And then that lawless one (Anti-Christ, man of lawlessness, son of destruction in 2Th 2:3-4+, the \"little horn\" of Da 7) will be revealed (apokalupto - he will be caused to be fully known, this \"revelation\" corresponding to the midpoint [3.5 years, time, times, half a time, 42 months, 1260 days - see table of these related phrases] of Daniel's Seventieth Week) whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth (cf Rev 19:15, 20+) and bring to an end by the appearance (epiphaneia - literally His \"shining forth\" or upon with the idea of sudden and unexpected!) of His coming (parousia - the Second Coming of Christ); 9 that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity (energeia - operative power) of Satan, with all power and signs and false (pseudos = lying) wonders, 10 and with all the deception (apate = that which gives a false impression, whether by appearance, statement or influence; causes one to have misleading or erroneous views concerning the Truth) of wickedness for those who perish (apollumi), because (TERM OF EXPLANATION - EXPLAINS WHY THEY WILL PERISH) they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. 11 And for this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence (this is a Divine judicial decree, a reaping of their sowing, a consequence of their refusal to readily and deliberately make the choice to accept the Truth by which they could have been delivered and born again) so that they might believe what is false.\n\nRevelation 2:9+ 'I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.\n\nRevelation 3:9+ 'Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie-- behold, I will make them to come and bow down at your feet, and to know that I have loved you.\n\n(5) HINDERS\n\n1 Thessalonians 2:18+ For we wanted to come to you-- I, Paul, more than once-- and yet Satan thwarted ( egkopto/enkopto from en = in + kopto = cut down, strike. To hinder, impede, detain. In classic Greek a military metaphor = to cut in on, throw obstacles in the way of or cut up the road so that normal movement is impossible!) us.\n\n(6) MURDERS\n\nJohn 8:44 (See #4 above)\n\n(7) PERVERTS\n\nActs 13:10+ (See #4 above)\n\n2Th 2:9-10+ (See #4 above)\n\n(8) PROMPTS\n\n1Chr 21:1 Then Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel. (Note: Actually God permitted Satan to prompt David to take a census of the people, and David insisted on doing it, contrary to Joab's advice. 2 Sa 24:1 \"Now again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and it incited David against them to say, \"Go, number Israel and Judah.\" The point is that Satan can only do what God allows! God here is said to have caused the action in the sense of permitting Satan to put David to the test. Be careful when you commit sins, for you are entering into Satan's domain of darkness!)\n\nJohn 13:2,26-27, 30 And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him... 26 Jesus therefore answered, \"That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him.\" So when He had dipped the morsel, He took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. 27 And after the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Jesus therefore said to him, \"What you do, do quickly.\"...30 And so after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night (an appropriate time for Judas who was now fully controlled by darkness, cf Luke 22:53 \"While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me; but this hour and the power [exousia] of darkness are yours.\").\n\nActs 5:3, 9+ But Peter said, \"Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back some of the price of the land?...9 Then Peter said to her, \"Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out as well.\"\n\n(9) SCHEMES\n\n2Cor 2:11+ (repent of an unforgiving spirit) in order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.\n\nComment: When we sin and fail to repent we give the devil an opportunity. In this verse the sin is unforgiveness and it allows Satan to take advantage, to exploit, to cheat or to defraud. We need to get out of the darkness and walk in the light, where Satan cannot gain an advantage. If the church family—or any person in the family—carries an unforgiving spirit, then Satan will use that attitude as a beachhead for new assaults against the church.\n\nAs someone has well said an unforgiving spirit is the devil’s playground, and before long it becomes the Christian’s battleground. If somebody hurts us, either deliberately or unintentionally, and we do not forgive them, then the potential is for us to develop bitterness, which hardens the heart. We should be tenderhearted and kind, but instead we are hardhearted and bitter. Actually, we are not hurting the person who hurt us but are only hurting ourselves. Bitterness in the heart makes us treat others the way Satan treats them, when we should treat others the way God has treated us. In His gracious kindness, God has forgiven us, and we should forgive others. God Himself is infinitely kind, tender–hearted, and forgiving, and we show those virtues by imitating their Source. We do not forgive for our sake or even for their sake, but for Jesus’ sake. Learning how to forgive is one of the secrets of a happy Christian life and allows one to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.\n\nEphesians 6:11s+\n\n1 Timothy 3:7+ And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare (pagis - a trap which is fixed or fastened by a noose or notch and which can fall unexpectedly or suddenly so that wild animals and birds are caught by surprise) of the devil.\n\n(10) STALKS\n\n1Peter 5:8-9+ Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. 9 But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.\n\n(11) STEALS\n\nMt 13:19+ \"When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road.\n\nLuke 8:12+ \"And those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.\n\n(12) TEMPTS\n\nMark 1:12-13+ And immediately the Spirit impelled Him to go out into the wilderness. 13 And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted (peirazo) by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him.\n\nLuke 4:1-13+ And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led about by the Spirit in the wilderness 2 for forty days, being tempted (peirazo) by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days; and when they had ended, He became hungry. 3 And the devil said to Him, \"If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.\"4 And Jesus answered him, \"It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE.'\" 5 And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the devil said to Him, \"I will give You all this domain (exousia) and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish (Jesus did not correct Satan - the world system indeed had been given to him as John wrote \"We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies [asleep like a baby in a cradle!] in the power of the evil one\" 1John 5:19). 7 \"Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours.\" 8 And Jesus answered and said to him, \"It is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'\" 9 And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, \"If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here; 10 for it is written, 'HE WILL GIVE HIS ANGELS CHARGE CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU,' 11 and, 'ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.'\" (Here the devil misquotes Scripture to his advantage - this promise applies only to those whose ways are in God's will and Satan left that critical detail out of the verse when he quoted Ps 92:11-12) 12 And Jesus answered and said to him, \"It is said, 'YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.'\" 13 And when the devil had finished every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time (see study of kairos).\n\n1Cor 7:5+ Stop depriving (present imperative = with negative implies this practice was already ongoing) one another, except (1) by agreement (2) for a time (kairos - a specified aliquot of time) (3) that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt (peirazo) you because of your lack of self-control. (Comment: The general rule is that neither husband nor wife has the right to refuse the physical relationship of marriage. Here Paul presents a possible exception that applies if all three conditions are fulfilled = sexual abstinence is permissible if the couple agrees in advance, set a specific time limit, and does so for the purpose of prayer. The KJV adds \"fasting and prayer\". Sexual abstinence can become a tool of Satan and is never to be used as pretense for spiritual superiority or as a means of intimidating or manipulating one’s spouse. Physical love is to be a normal and regular experience shared by both marriage partners and avoids \"the schemes of the devil\"!)\n\n1Thess 3:5+ For this reason (knowing they were going to suffer affliction which might have made them vulnerable to the schemes of the devil), when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter (peirazo) might have tempted you, and our labor should be in vain (empty, fruitless, without success).\n\n(13) THREATENS\n\nHeb 2:14-15+ Since then the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil; 15 and might deliver those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.\n\nComment: The wages of sin are death, spiritually and eternally. Christ died as a satisfactory sacrifice [see Heb 2:16-17+] and paid the price for our sins, the wages of which were death [Ro 6:23+] so that the devil no longer holds the power of death over believers and we no longer are held in bondage to that fear).\n\nThis list (which is not exhaustive) of the \"wiles of the devil\" should thoroughly convince each of us of our need to be totally dependent on the full of armor of God and His Spirit's strengthening of our inner man (pray Eph 3:16+), causing us not to hesitate for even a moment to put on the whole armor! What are you waiting for dear Christian friend? Are any of the \"pieces\" missing or in disrepair. Then return and confess and repent and go forth into battle as more than a conqueror through Him Who loved us.\n\n\"Repent (aorist imperative = urgent.

But in the context of Ephesians they are more likely to have been deliberate attempts to destroy the unity of Christ's body (Eph 3:14-22; 4:1-16, 27) through the invasion of false doctrine and the fomenting of dissension (Eph 4:2, 21, 31, 32; 5:6).

See the discussion on the background on spiritual warfare (Click Ephesians 6:12)\n\nThe New York Times, in reporting on a survey by the Barna Group, noted that two-thirds of Americans do not believe in the devil as a living entity. The Times called it “a result of fundamental, long-term shifts in the nation’s religious culture.”\n\nRay Stedman writes that \"The devil is real, he is active, he is working day and night, trying to subvert and undo and defeat God's plan in human history. The devil is our enemy. And this is war. There is a spiritual war going on behind the scenes of history, and that spiritual war in the unseen world is driving events in our own visible world. There is no peace in the material world because there is a war now raging in the spiritual world. There is nothing more meaningful, more relevant, more real that we could be involved in than the cause of God in this vast spiritual war. The biblical teaching of spiritual warfare shines a spotlight of truth on the basic problem of human existence and human history. (Spiritual Warfare)\n\nWuest has an interesting comment that the literal meaning of \"to throw through\" means “to riddle one with accusations.” (Wuest Word Studies - Eerdman Publishing Company Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3 - used by permission)\n\nWarren Wiersbe makes an important point about dealing with the devil...\n\nI was watching an electrician install a complex control panel. I said to the man, “It just amazes me how you fellows can calmly work on those lines with all of that power there. How do you do it?” The electrician smiled and said, “Well, the first thing you have to do is respect it. Then you can handle it.”\n\nSatan is a dangerous enemy. He is a serpent who can bite us when we least expect it. He is a destroyer (Rev 12:11; Abaddon and Apollyon both mean “destruction”) and an accuser (Zech. 3:1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Rev. 12:9, 10, 11). He has great power and intelligence, and a host of demons who assist him in his attacks against God’s people (Eph 6:10ff). He is a formidable enemy; we must never joke about him, ignore him, or underestimate his ability. We must “be sober” and have our minds under control when it comes to our conflict with Satan.\n\nA part of this soberness includes not blaming everything on the devil. Some people see a demon behind every bush and blame Satan for their headaches, flat tires, and high rent. While it is true that Satan can inflict physical sickness and pain (Luke 13:16; Job 1:8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,1 7, 18, 19, 20, 21 - see especially Job 1:22!), we have no biblical authority for casting out “demons of headache” or “demons of backache.” One lady phoned me long distance to inform me that Satan had caused her to shrink seven and a half inches. While I have great respect for the wiles and powers of the devil, I still feel we must get our information about him from the Bible and not from our own interpretation of experiences. (Bible Exposition Commentary - New Testament)\n\nIn warfare knowledge of one's enemy is vital in order to assure victory in battle. General Erwin Rommel was known as the \"Desert Fox\" because of his military prowess, especially in the North African desert in WWII. It is said that one of the keys that eventually led to his defeat was the fact that the Allied command was able to \"get inside his head\" and gain a sense of how he would strategize. How did they do this? They studied his detailed memoirs which had been published and thus began to gain insights into his personality, and thus his methods! In the same way, although believers are not to focus on Satanology, they are called to be aware of his schemes. Paul emphasized the importance of forgiveness to the church at Corinth...\n\nin order that no advantage (pleonekteo = from pleion = more + echo = have > the idea is to outwit, get the better of, cheat, exploit or defraud) be taken of us by Satan (literally = Adversary); for we are not ignorant (unaware, uninformed about) of his schemes (KJV = devices = noema = purposes conceived by thinking = designs, intentions, schemes, plots, stratagems). (2 Cor 2:11+)\n\nThe works of the devil are defined as \"schemes\" (Ephesians 6:11+), \"devices\" (KJV) (2Cor 2:11+), \"snares\" (2Ti 2:26-note). Our adversary beguiles, seduces, opposes, resists, deceives, sows tares, hinders, buffets, tempts, persecutes, blasphemes. Our adversary is personal, aggressive, intelligent, cunning and destructive, and is to be reckoned with seriously, vigilantly and intelligently.\n\nBe careful to avoid one of two extremes in regard to the devil. First, do not think that Satan causes everything and is everywhere. Satan is a created being and a controlled being (cf. see especially Job 1-2; Zech. 3:1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and is neither omnipresent nor omniscient. The other extreme is justly as dangerous and that is to think that there is no such being as the devil, but that he is imaginary or myth. He is very real and very wily believers need to be very wary (not frightened). As stated elsewhere in the notes the spiritual struggle believers face with the devil and his demonic henchmen is not a power struggle as much as it is a truth struggle and the primary battlefield is therefore our minds.\n\nIn Ephesians 2:1, 2:2 (see notes) we are introduced to him.\n\nAnd you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience\" (Ep 2:1, 2-notes)\n\nComment: Satan occupies a twofold in the earth and in the air; ruling over both evil men and evil spirits. Christ never acknowledged Satan as king, but three times he calls him \"the prince of this world,\" thereby acknowledging his governmental authority. Ephesians teaches that he is the ruling spirit over \"the sons of disobedience,\" which includes all unregenerate mankind.\n\nIn John 8:44 Jesus said \"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.\"\n\nComment: Because he is a liar and a murderer, the devil's work is to deceive and to destroy. There you have the explanation for all the misery, hatred, murder, war, and other evils that have taken place in human history. Whom the devil cannot deceive, he tries to destroy, and whom he cannot destroy, he attempts to deceive. That is the working of the devil\n\nThe devil was once an angel in heaven, the most beautiful angel in heaven (cf Isa 14:12:15, Ezek 28:13-18). He led a rebellion against God (Rev 12:4+) and, as a result, was cast into the lower heavens. He walks on this earth, but he still has access into heaven to accuse the brethren both day and night.\n\nIn Genesis 3 we read that \"the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, \"Indeed, has God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?\" (Genesis 3:1+)\n\nThe devil deceived the woman and caused the man to sin. By getting Adam to sin, sin entered the world and something else happened. Paul writes \"Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned-- (Ro 5:12+)\n\nAs a result of the sin of Adam, the depravity of man, the authority of this earth, its inhabitants and its lower atmosphere became Satan’s legally in the just system of God. When man sinned, it was like the world was turned over to the authority (exousia = now Satan had the right and might) of darkness, legally, because man chose to disobey his God. Death, the result of the curse of sin, was his weapon. His kingdom is a kingdom of darkness and deceit. Every person is born into his kingdom.\n\nWayne Barber writes that...\n\nBefore the cross and the substitutionary death of Jesus on the cross, man lived in fear of the devil and death. But Jesus conquered them both. In Ephesians 1:20 it says that He, Jesus, was seated far above all principality and powers. As a matter of fact, look at verse 20:\n\nwhich He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come. (See notes Ephesians 1:20; 1:21)\n\nHe didn’t say He seated Him above, he said He seated Him \"far above\". Let me explain to you what that means. If you could take the power of Satan and put it on a scale next to the power of God, his doesn’t even show up. God’s is far above all principalities and powers. I want you to know that warfare is not a struggle against power. It is a struggle to maintain truth. We will see that as we walk through this. Satan is no equal to God. He is a creation. God is the Creator!\n\nSPIRITUAL WARFARE\n\nis not a struggle against\n\nPOWER.\n\nIt is a struggle to maintain\n\nthe TRUTH.\n\nWell, the believer needs to be aware that Satan is around. We are told that by Peter in his epistle. We need to be aware of the demonic. We need to be aware of darkness. We need to be aware that it has infected a world system and is in our face daily. We need to be aware of that, however, our focus is not to be on that. Our focus is to be on the resurrected, ascended, glorified Lord Jesus Christ and on His resurrection power in each individual life.\n\nFOCUS ON THE LIGHT\n\nOur FOCUS is to be on the resurrected, ascended, glorified Lord Jesus Christ and on His resurrection power in each individual life. That is our focus. We do not focus on darkness. We focus on light. The Prince and the power of light is the Lord Jesus Himself.\n\n1 John 5:18-19+ says \"We know that no one who is born of God [transformed, delivered, made into a new creature] sins [habitually = present tense] but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. We know that we are of God, and that the whole world (kosmos) lies (present tense = continually) in [the power of] the evil one.\" (Comment: Note that \"touch him\" means touch to do harm.)\n\nJ Vernon McGee has an interesting comment on \"lies\" in 1John 5:19 \"This is the text of a sermon which I have preached on several occasions entitled “When the Devil Puts the Baby to Sleep.” “And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth [actually, lies asleep - e.g., see Lk 2:12,16] in wickedness [or, in the arms of the wicked one].” In other words, the Devil has the world asleep. The Devil is saying to Vernon McGee, “Sh-h-h. Hush! You’re waking people up, and we don’t want to do that! They are very comfortable. Many people in churches are dead in trespasses and sins, and we don’t want to wake them up. Let’s leave them alone.” The Devil is concerned when people are awakened. You and I are living in a world that is asleep in the arms of the wicked one—if you look around today, you must agree with that statement. (McGee, J V: Thru the Bible Commentary: Thomas Nelson)\n\nPaul had warned about the wiles of the devil earlier writing \"and do not give (stop giving = present imperative with a negative) the devil an opportunity. (Ep 4:27-note) (See Dwight Pentecost's comment)\n\nThe KJV Commentary warns that \"Men dream of a devil that is a hideous, horned, and hoofed monster who haunts the vice dens of the world; but God says he fashions himself into an angel of light and fashions his ministers as ministers of righteousness (2Cor 11:14,15+). He is the champion of liberalism, ritualism, rationalism, and every other “ism” that seeks to displace Christ. His aim is to substitute something else and something different for the grace and truth of Christ. Never underestimate the enemy. (free online KJV Bible Commentary)\n\nJohn Eadie writes that \"The great enemy of man, a veteran fierce and malignant, has a method of warfare peculiar to himself, for it consists of “wiles.” His battles are the rush of a sudden ambuscade. He fights not on a pitched field, but by sudden assault and secret and cunning onslaught. Vigilance, self-possession, and promptitude are therefore indispensable to meet him: and as his aim is to throw his opponents off their guard and then to surprise them, so there is need to be ever clothed in this complete armour of God. His “wiles” are seen in unsettling the mind of Eve by representing God as jealous of the first man and woman; in stirring up the warlike aspirations of David to take a military census and force a conscription as the basis of a standing army; in inflaming the avaricious and sordid spirit of Judas; and in his assaults on our Lord by an appeal to appetite, piety, and ambition. (Ephesians 6 Commentary)\n\nDiabolos is the noun form of the verb diaballo which describes not only those who bring a false charge against one, but also those who disseminate the truth concerning a man, and do so maliciously, insidiously and with hostility.\n\nNotice how the root words (diá = through + ballo = throw) picture what the devil does. He constantly throws between seeking to divide whether it be between a husband and wife, a child and parent, a church, etc. Resist his divisive, condemnatory accusations firm in your faith. Wuest has an interesting comment that the literal meaning of \"to throw through\" means “to riddle one with accusations.”\n\nDiabolos is applied some 34 times to Satan, the god of this world, and in each case has the definite article in the Greek (\"the\" = defining a specific entity) and is never in the plural (the three uses below in the pastoral epistles are all plural) as when applied to men who, by opposing the cause of God, may be said to act the part of the devil or to side with him.\n\nDiabolos is coupled with the word “Satan” (transliteration of Hebrew word meaning “adversary”) in the Revelation, John recording that an angel from heaven \"laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years (Re 20:2-note)\n\nDiabolos is used of one who makes accusations and presses charges. In Revelation 12:9-10+, we read that \"the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, \"Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser (kategor) of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses (kategoreo - present tense = describes the devil's continual activity) them before our God day and night.\" How grateful saints can be that \"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\" (Ro 8:1+)\n\nAre you safe and protected from the devil's accusations \"in Christ Jesus\" dear reader? If not, cry out this very moment to the Most High God for Him to give you His grace that you might this moment experience eternal security in Christ through your exercising of personal faith in Christ's life, death, burial, resurrection and sure, soon return. God is faithful.\n\nConstable summarizes Satan's schemes - Satan has consistently aimed his personal attacks at getting people to doubt, to deny, to disregard, and to disobey the revealed will of God (cf. Gen. 3; Matt. 4). The world system seeks to get people to believe that they do not need God but can get along very well without Him (1 John 2). The flesh tempts us to think that we can find satisfaction, joy, and fulfillment on the physical, material level of life alone (Ro 7). (Ephesians Expository Notes) (Boding added)\n\nWarren Wiersbe gives us \"A word of caution here: never discuss things with Satan or his associates. Eve made this mistake, and we all know the sad consequences. Also, never try to fight Satan in your own way. Resist him the way Jesus did, with the Word of God (Mt 4:1-11, Ed: Lk 4:1-11, 14+ - note that Jesus as fully man was giving us an example to follow and fended off the Devil's attacks by being filled with the Spirit and filled with the Word! See Filled with His Spirit/Richly Indwelt with His Word - If you are not memorizing the Word of God [see also Memory Verses by Topic], you are disregarding and discarding one of your primary weapons against the Devil, the \"sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.\" - Eph 6:17+). (see Bible Exposition Commentary - New Testament )\n\nWilliam Evans wrote that it is popular in some circles to day to spell the word devil with the letter \"d\" left off thus reducing the idea of an actual person called the devil to a mere influence called evil. The devil may be out of fashion, but he's not out of business and as Evans adds \"If the devil can't mislead people that way, he would have them think of him as a horrible, monstrous-looking creature with a forked tail, dressed in a fiery red suit, and with horns protruding from his head. If the devil can get folks to think of him like that, then when he comes as an 'angel of light', he will not be recognized, and so find it easier to beguile his unsuspecting victims.\"\n\nDr. Robert Thomas, professor of New Testament at The Master’s Seminary, warns: People don’t often go heretical all at once. It is gradual. And they do not do so intentionally most of the time. They slip into it through shoddiness and laziness in handling the word of truth.… All it takes to start the road to heresy is a craving for something new and different, a flashy new idea, along with a little laziness or carelessness or lack of precision in handling the truth of God. (2Ti 2:15) All around us today are startling reminders of doctrinal slippage and outright failure. (2Ti 4:3) In case after case someone who should have known the truth of God better failed in upholding that truth.\n\nNames of Satan\n\nRemember that names in Scripture are often very significant. Thus a name often reflects the character or attribute of the one who is named. With that thought in mind, ponder these names for Satan as they teach us volumes about his evil attributes and subtle schemes. Be sure to read the related Scriptures, taking care to note the context which will give you a fuller sense of your intractable enemy. And the better you know the wiles of your enemy, the more likely you will be to experience victory in the daily spiritual struggle in which we are all involved until we see Jesus face to face!\n\nAccuser - Opposes believers before God - Rev 12:10 (THOUGHT - Praise God we have an omnipotent Advocate before God - 1Jn 2:1)\n\nAdversary - Against God - 1Pe 5:8\n\nBeelzebul - Lord of the fly - Mt 12:24\n\nBelial - Worthless - 2Co 6:15\n\nDevil - Slanderer- Mt 4:1\n\nDragon - Destructive - Rev 12:3, 7, 9 (THOUGHT - Shoots \"fiery missiles\" at our mind!)\n\nEnemy - Opponent - Mt 13:28\n\nEvil one - Intrinsically evil - Jn 17:15\n\nGod of this world - Influences thinking of world - 2Co 4:4 (THOUGHT - Think about the nightly \"news\" - one reason I fast from news!)\n\nLiar - Perverts the truth - Jn 8:44 (THOUGHT - But he does so by adding a sliver of a lie to a slice of truth).\n\nMurderer - Leads people to eternal death - Jn 8:44 (THOUGHT - Genesis 3 is the case in point!)\n\nPrince of the power of the air - Control of unbelievers - Eph 2:2 (THOUGHT - Their father is the Devil!!!)\n\nRoaring lion - One who destroys - 1Pe 5:8 (THOUGHT - Also one who roars and induces fear).\n\nRuler of demons - Leader of fallen angels - Mk 3:22 (THOUGHT - He is finite and one place at a time, but his henchmen are well dispersed).\n\nRuler of this world - Rules in world system - Jn 12:31\n\nSatan - Adversary - 1Ti 5:15\n\nSerpent of old - Deceiver in garden - Rev 12:9; 20:2 (THOUGHT - Don't be deceived because he is very crafty!)\n\nTempter - Solicits people to sin - 1Th 3:5 (Adapted from The MacArthur Study Bible)\n\nVincent has an interesting note: \"Temptation is thus represented as impelled from a distance. Satan attacks by indirection—through good things from which no evil is suspected. There is a hint of its propagating power: one sin draws another in its track: the flame of the fire-tipped dart spreads. Temptation acts on susceptible material. Self-confidence is combustible. Faith, in doing away with dependence on self, takes away fuel for the dart. It creates sensitiveness to holy influences by which the power of temptation is neutralized. It enlists the direct aid of God.\"\n\nJ C Ryle in his excellent book Thoughts for Young Men has a pithy section on the schemes of the devil in the lives of young men (and old men)...\n\nThe devil uses special diligence to destroy the souls of young men, and they don't seem to know it.\n\nSatan knows very well that you will make up the next generation and therefore he employs every trick to make you his own. I would not have you to be ignorant of his schemes (2Co 2:11+)\n\nYou are those on whom he puts his choicest temptations. He spreads his net with the most watchful carefulness, to entangle your hearts. He baits his trap with the sweetest morsels, to get you into his power. He displays his wares before your eyes with his utmost ingenuity, in order to make you buy his sugared poisons, and eat his accursed treats. You are the grand object of his attack. May the Lord rebuke him, and deliver you out of his hands.\n\nYoung men, beware of being taken by his snares (1Ti 3:7+, 2Ti 2:26+). He will try to throw dust in your eyes, and prevent you seeing anything in its true colors. He would eagerly make you think that evil is good, and good is evil (Isa 5:20). He will paint, cover with gold, and dress up sin, in order to make you fall in love with it. He will deform, and misrepresent, and fabricate true Christianity, in order to make you take a dislike to it. He will exalt the pleasures of wickedness — but he will hide from you the sting (Heb 11:25+, cf Pr 5:3,4, 14:12). He will lift up before your eyes the cross and its painfulness– but he will keep out of sight the eternal crown. He will promise you everything, as he did to Christ (Lk 4:5,6+), if you will only serve him. He will even help you to wear a form of Christianity, if you will only neglect the power (2Ti 3:5+). He will tell you at the beginning of your lives, it is too soon to serve God — he will tell you at the end, it is too late. Oh, do not be deceived (Dt 11:16+, 1Cor 6:9+, 1Cor 15:33+, Gal 6:7+, James 1:16+)!\n\nYou don't know the danger you are in from this enemy; and it is this very ignorance which makes me afraid. You are like blind men, walking among holes and pitfalls; you do not see the perils which are around you on every side.\n\nYour enemy is mighty. He is called \"The Prince of this world\" (John 14:30). He opposed our Lord Jesus Christ all through His ministry. He tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and so brought sin and death into the world. He even tempted David, the man after God's own heart, and caused his latter days to be full of sorrow. He even tempted Peter, the chosen Apostle, and made him deny his Lord. Surely his hostility towards man and God is to be despised.\n\nYour enemy is restless. He never sleeps. He is always going around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour (1Pe 5:8+). He is always going back and forth in the earth, and walking up and down on it (Job 1:7). You may be careless about your souls: but he is not. He wants your soul to make you miserable, like himself, and will have your soul if he can. Surely his hatred towards men and God is to be despised.\n\nAnd your enemy is cunning (Ge 3:1+). For thousands of years he has been reading one book, and that book is the heart of man. He ought to know it well, and he does know it — all its weakness, all its deceitfulness, all its folly. And he has a storehouse full of temptations, such as are most likely to do the heart of man the most harm. Never will you go to the place where he will not find you. Go into the city — he will be there. Go into the wilderness — he will be there also. Sit among drunkards — and he will be there to help you. Listen to preaching — and he will be there to distract you. Surely such ill-will is to be despised.\n\nYoung men, this enemy is working hard for your destruction, however little you may think it. You are the prize for which he is specially contending for. He foresees you must either be the blessings or the curses of your day, and he is trying hard to effect a place in your hearts early in your life, in order that you may help advance his kingdom each day. Well does he understand that to spoil the bud is the surest way to mar the flower.\n\nOh that your eyes were opened, like those of Elisha's servant Dothan (2Ki 6:17)! Oh that you could see what Satan is scheming against your peace! I must warn you — I must exhort you. Whether you will hear or not, I cannot, dare not, leave you alone.\n\nJohn Stott (quoted by John MacArthur) has a quote from Hugh Latimer's \"The Sermon of the Plow\" which relates to one of the craftiest schemes of the devil. Stott quotes Latimer's words...\n\nAnd now I would ask you a strange question; who is the most diligent bishop and prelate in all England; that passes all the rest in doing his office? I can tell, for I know who it is; I know him well. But now I think I see you listening and hearkening that I should name him. There is one that passes all the other [sic], and is the most diligent prelate and preacher in all England. And will ye know who it is? I will tell you—it is the Devil. He is the most diligent preacher of all others; he is never out of his diocese; he is never away from his cure; you shall never find him unoccupied; he is ever in his parish; he keeps residence at all times; you shall never find him out of the way; call for him when you will, he is ever at home. He is the most diligent preacher in all the realm; he is ever at his plough; nor lording or loitering can hinder him; he is ever applying his business; you shall never find him idle, I warrant you.… Where the devil is resident, and has his plough going, there away with books and up with candles; away with Bibles and up with beads; away with the light of the Gospel and up with the light of candles, yea at noonday; … up with man’s traditions and his laws, down with God’s traditions and his most holy Word.… Oh that our prelates would be as diligent to sow the corn of good doctrine as Satan is to sow cockle and darnel!… There never was such a preacher in England as he is. (STOTT GOES ON TO WRITE \"THE CONCLUSION OF THE SERMON WENT LIKE THIS.\") The prelates are lords … and no labourers; but the devil is diligent at his plough. He is no unpreaching prelate; he is no lordly loiterer from his cure; but a busy ploughman.… Therefore, ye unpreaching prelates, learn of the devil: to be diligent in doing of your office.… If you will not learn of God, nor good men, to be diligent in your office, learn of the devil. (Borrow Stott's book page 27 - Between two worlds : the art of preaching in the twentieth century)\n\nQuestion: What are the wiles of the devil in Ephesians 6:11? | GotQuestions.org\n\nAnswer: Wiles are tricks or manipulations designed to deceive someone. The tongue-in-cheek phrase a woman’s wiles refers to the seductiveness of femme fatales in using charm or sex appeal to elicit a desired response from men. Wiles of the devil are those clever schemes used by Satan to ensnare us through temptation, threat, or intimidation. Ephesians 6:11 warns us to “put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” (KJV). Other Bible versions speak of the “devil’s schemes,” “strategies,” or “evil tricks” rather than “wiles.” Scripture gives us insight into our enemy’s tactics: “We are not unaware of his schemes” (2 Corinthians 2:11), and we are wise to heed its warnings.\n\nHere are some of the devil’s wiles we see in Scripture:\n\n1. Challenging God’s Word.\n\nGenesis 3 gives us a detailed look into this tactic of our enemy. It led to the first human sin, and Satan still uses it because it works so well. The first recorded words of the devil, through the serpent, were these: “Did God really say?” (Genesis 3:1). With those words, the devil invited the woman to reconsider what she understood God to have said. By adding her human interpretation, she convinced herself that God’s Word was far too restrictive.\n\nBy suggesting that we should reexamine the clear teaching of God’s Word, Satan invites us to add our own interpretation and thereby nullify God’s stated will. Entire church denominations are falling prey to these wiles of the devil. “Did God really say that homosexuality is wrong?” he hisses, and churches crumble. “Did God really say there are only two genders?” he suggests, inviting us to put our own spin on reality, making ourselves gods in place of the Lord. Ephesians 6:11 says that we need to be clothed in the whole armor of God to withstand such wiles.\n\n2. Challenging our identity.\n\nLuke 4:1–13 gives insight into several of the devil’s wiles. Satan came against Jesus to tempt Him in the wilderness. On two different occasions, Satan began his temptations with these words: “If you are the Son of God.” Satan knew exactly who Jesus was (Mark 1:34). Jesus was there when Satan fell “like lightning from heaven” (Luke 10:18). Significantly, the devil chose a time when Jesus was physically weak and hungry to attack His identity.\n\nSatan does the same with us. To make his wiles more effective, he hits us during a crisis or a spiritual struggle and suggests, “If you were a child of God, this wouldn’t happen. If you were actually a Christian, God would help you right now.” Again, we need the “helmet of salvation” firmly in place to withstand such attacks against our identity and God’s character (Ephesians 6:17).\n\n3. Twisting Scripture.\n\nAnother of the wiles the devil used against Jesus was to quote Scripture, but with a twist. In Luke 4:10–11, Satan quotes Psalm 91:11–12 in an effort to persuade Jesus to act in the flesh rather than follow the Spirit (see Galatians 5:16, 25). But Satan failed to complete the thought of the psalm. The next verse, Psalm 91:13, says, “You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.” Those animal references are metaphors for fierce and dangerous enemies—and the devil is likened to both a lion and a serpent in Scripture (Genesis 3:15; Revelation 20:2; 1 Peter 5:8; cf. Romans 16:20). The true meaning of the passage in Psalm 91 is that God will protect and empower His servants as they overcome the enemy, Satan. One of the wiles of the devil is to leave out key parts of Scripture in order to twist its meaning to fit his agenda.\n\nWe see these wiles of the devil in action today, as prosperity teachers and false prophets quote Scripture in selfish and misleading ways. They use enough of God’s Word to sound authoritative, but they twist it to fit their personal agendas. Cherry-picking the Bible for verses that affirm whatever we want to believe or do is a widespread problem, and most participants have no idea they have fallen victim to one of the wiles of the devil.\n\n4. Offering a tempting alternative to obedience.\n\nAnother scheme or wile of the devil used in the temptation of Jesus was to suggest another path, avoiding strict obedience to God’s will. Cunningly, Satan knew better than to suggest that Jesus forget the whole salvation plan and go back to heaven. Instead, he offered an alternative. In Luke 4:5–7, “the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, ‘I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. If you worship me, it will all be yours.’” This temptation was aimed at the humanity of the Son of Man. Jesus now knew what it felt like to be in the flesh. He knew what spikes would feel like in His hands and feet. He knew what rejection and mockery would feel like when He was stripped naked and paraded before the crowds. Satan was offering Him a compromise. What if Jesus could “save the world” without having to suffer crucifixion? What if He could take a shortcut and possess all the world’s kingdoms now?\n\nOne of the most sinister wiles of the devil involves his ability to offer a religiously tainted compromise. He knows he can’t come at mature believers with a frontal attack on their values and convictions. So he slides in the back door, posing as a friend with a reasonable alternative: “Well, yes, technically it might be wrong for someone to move in with a boyfriend, but you can witness to him better as he watches you live out your faith.” Or this: “You don’t need to go to church to be spiritual. You connect better with God alone in the woods. Those people are all hypocrites anyway, and you are too righteous to associate with them.” We must beware of the devil’s wiles when he offers something other than total obedience to God’s will.\n\nThe New Testament writers often pointed out the wiles of the devil to those in the church who were falling for them, and we should take note. The presence of false prophets (1 Timothy 6:3–5), busybodies (1 Peter 4:15), adulterers (1 Timothy 1:9–10), and seducers (Revelation 2:20) are all part of Satan’s masterplan to undermine the church from within.\n\nTo combat the wiles of the devil, followers of Christ must stay clothed in the armor of God. We must stay immersed in His Word so that we recognize deception. And when we realize we have been caught in the wiles of the devil, we must quickly repent and seek godly accountability. Psalm 37:23–24 encourages those who desire to live godly lives: “The steps of a man are established by the LORD, when he delights in his way; though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the LORD upholds his hand.” When the Lord holds our hand, the devil’s wiles cannot harm us.\n\nThe Spiritual Warfare (c1623), a print by Martin Droeshout depicting the devil's army besieging a walled city\n\nheld by a \"Christian Soldier bold\" guarded by figures representing the Christian virtues.\n\nIt has been suggested that this print may have influenced Bunyan to write The Holy War.\n\nMultiple Resources\n\nRelated to Satan\n\nGotquestions.org\n\nHow, why, and when did Satan fall from heaven?\n\nIs Satan in hell?

From their experiences we will learn\n\nthe targets Satan aims at in your life;\n\nthe weapons he uses to attack you;\n\nthe purposes that he wants to achieve; and\n\nthe defenses God has provided for you.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this book is a manual of arms for the Christian soldier. It is not a devotional reader for the believer who has gone AWOL. It is a deadly serious guidebook for the dedicated Christian who is on the battefield and wants to know how to win.\n\nPlease do not speed-read these pages. Read them carefully, especially the many quotations from God’s Word. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you understand and assimilate these truths. There is no “padding” in these chapters. These studies represent the essentials—the rock-bottom fundamentals—of what God has taught me about the Christian warfare through many years of studying and battling. I have proved these truths in my own life and ministry.\n\nNo doubt Satan will do everything he can to keep you from benefiting from this book. He will distract you and detour you. He will seek to confuse you, or perhaps make you critical. He will arrange interruptions. I suggest you ask the Lord for his help and protection as you study these pages. “Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4). Positionally, you are in Christ and delivered from the power of Satan.\n\nFor He delivered us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son. Colossians 1:13\n\nMy aim in this book is to help you experience this victory practically.\n\nThe truths in these pages will do you no good unless they are put into practice. Satan enjoys seeing Christians get a head-knowledge of victory without a heart-experience, because this lulls believers into a false security, and Satan finds them an easy prey. It is not the reading of truth, or even the enjoying of truth that brings the blessing. It is the doing of the truth. Therefore, determine with the Spirit’s help to put these truths into practice.\n\nRemember: you are not fighting for victory, but from victory, for Jesus Christ has already defeated Satan!\n\nWhen He had disarmed the rulers and authorities [Satanic powers], He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him [Christ]. Colossians 2:15\n\nNow judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out. John 12:31\n\nAnd they overcame him [Satan] because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even to death. Revelation 12:11\n\nNow, on to victory!\n\nChapter One The Deceiver\n\n“He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.” John 8:44\n\nAnd the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. Revelation 12:9\n\nBut I am afraid, lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds should be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ. 2 Corinthians 11:3\n\nFor many deceivers have gone out into the world. 2 John 7\n\nNow the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ’You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?”\n\nAnd the woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden, we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ’You shall not eat from it or touch it, lest you die.’”\n\nAnd the serpent said to the woman, “You surely shall not die! For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”\n\nWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.\n\nThen the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings. Genesis 3:1-7\n\n1. SATAN’S TARGET—YOUR MIND\n\nWhen Satan wanted to lead the first man and woman into sin, he started by attacking the woman’s mind. This is made clear in 2 Corinthians 11:3.\n\nBut I am afraid, lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds should be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.\n\nWhy would Satan want to attack your mind? Because your mind is the part of the image of God where God communicates with you and reveals his will to you. It is unfortunate that some Christians have minimized the significance of the mind, because the Bible emphasizes its importance.\n\nDo not lie to one another, since you have laid aside the old self with its evil practices, and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him. Colossians 3:9, 10\n\nThis I say therefore, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality, for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Ephesians 4:17-24\n\nAnd do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. Romans 12:2\n\nGod renews our lives by renewing our minds, and he renews our minds through his truth. This truth is the Word of God.\n\nSanctify them in the truth; Thy word is truth. John 17:17\n\nIf Satan can get you to believe a lie, then he can begin to work in your life to lead you into sin. This is why he attacks the mind, and this is why we must protect our minds from the attacks of the wicked one.\n\nFinally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things. Philippians 4:8\n\n“If it is not true,” Paul writes, “do not let it enter your mind.”\n\nIn recent years, science has discovered many fascinating things about the human mind. Like a computer, your mind can store facts and impressions—and even emotions—and recall them years later. Your mind can reach into the past through memory, or it can reach into the future through imagination. Your thinking affects your feeling and your willing.\n\nFor as he thinks within himself, so he is. Proverbs 23:7\n\nThe doctor says, “You are what you eat.” The psychologist says, “You are what you think.” Satan knows the tremendous power of your mind, and he tries to capture it for himself.\n\nThe steadfast of mind Thou wilt keep in perfect peace, because he trusts in Thee. Isaiah 26:3\n\nFor the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace. Romans 8:6\n\nYour mind affects your whole being. While I do not totally agree with the “success psychology” and “healing psychology” of our day, I must admit that attitudes are important to health and success in life. The exciting new field of “holistic medicine” draws upon the influences of the mind to help the patient cure himself. Sales managers “psych up” their salesmen with thoughts of accomplishment and success, just as coaches do their football teams. While thinking alone does not make it so, it certainly helps!\n\n2. SATAN’S WEAPON—LIES\n\nSatan came to Eve as the serpent, the subtle deceiver.\n\n…the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. Revelation 12:9\n\n…there is no truth in him…for he is a liar and the father of lies. John 8:44\n\nIt is important that you notice the steps Satan took in getting Eve to believe his lie.\n\n(1) He questioned God’s Word. “Indeed, has God said…?” He did not deny that God had spoken; he simply questioned whether God had really said what Eve thought he had said. “Perhaps you misunderstood what God spoke,” is Satan’s suggestion. “You owe it to yourself to rethink what he said.” It is worth noting that in this suggestion Satan is also questioning God’s goodness. “If God really loved you, he wouldn’t keep something from you.” He tried the same approach with our Lord in the wilderness: “If you are God’s beloved Son, why are you hungry?”\n\n(2) He denied God’s Word. “You surely shall not die!” It is but a short step from questioning God’s Word to denying it. Of course, neither Adam nor Eve had ever seen death. All they had to go on was the Word of God, but this was all they needed. If Eve had not listened to Satan questioning God’s Word, she would never have fallen into his trap when he denied God’s Word.\n\n(3) He substituted his own lie. “You will be like God!” Adam and Eve were already made in the image of God, but Satan tempted them with an even greater privilege: to be like God! This was, of course, Satan’s great ambition when he was Lucifer, God’s angelic servant.\n\n“How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, you who have weakened the nations! But you said in your heart, ’I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit on the mount of the assembly, in the recesses of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.’” Isaiah 14:12-14\n\nSatan is a created being, a creature; but he wanted to be worshiped and served like the Creator. It was this attitude that led him to rebel against God and seek to establish his own kingdom. “You will be like God” is the one gigantic lie that has controlled civilization since the fall of man.\n\nFor they exchanged the truth of God for a lie [literally “the lie”], and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. Romans 1:25\n\nSatan desires worship and service, and Jesus Christ would give him neither!\n\nAgain, the devil took Him to a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory; and he said to Him, “All these things will I give You, if You fall down and worship me.” Then Jesus said to him, “Begone, Satan! For it is written, ’You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.’” Matthew 4:8-10\n\nSatan’s lie “You will be like God” motivates and controls much of our civilization today. Man is seeking to pull himself up by his own bootstraps. He is working to build a utopia on earth and possibly take it to outer space. Through education, psychiatry, religions of one kind or another (most of which ignore Jesus Christ, sin, and salvation), and better environment, men are defying God and deifying themselves. They are playing right into the hands of Satan.\n\nHow did Eve respond to Satan’s approach? She responded by making three mistakes that led her into sin.\n\n(1) She took away from God’s Word. In verse 2, Eve omitted the word “freely.” God’s original word in Genesis 2:16 was, “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely.” We get the impression that Eve caught Satan’s subtle suggestion, “God is holding out on you!” When you start to question or"
