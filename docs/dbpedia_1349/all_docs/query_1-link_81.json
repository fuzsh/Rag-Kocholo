        "text": "VOICE OVER: Mathew Arter WRITTEN BY: Mathew Arter\n\nThere's no shame in having a good cry now and then. For this list we'll be tearing up as we remember the saddest and most emotionally damaging deaths in the Final Fantasy franchise. In this video, fan favorite characters such as Clive of Final Fantasy XVI, Tidus from Final Fantasy X, and of course Aerith of Final Fantasy VII and so many more than made us go through an entire box of tissues.\n\nThe 10 Saddest Final Fantasy Deaths\n\nWelcome to MojoPlays, and get your tissues out, because we’re looking at the 10 Saddest Final Fantasy Deaths. They were here, and now they aren’t, and they might have ruined our childhood, and taught us that love is dead. Let’s go.\n\nBiggs, Wedge and Jessie\n\n“Final Fantasy VII” (1997)\n\nAt the beginning of Final Fantasy VII, and on the player’s first playthrough, there’s no reason to think that this journey will ever go further than Midgar. Therefore, we safely decided we could attach ourselves to our DEAR FRIENDS! Bigg, Wedge and Jessie, join the player as members of Avalanche, the group Cloud has joined to carry out terrorist behavior for the greater good. Arguably, they are terrorists, but they’re the sweetest terrorists you’ll ever meet. During one of the first massive heartbreaking moments in the game, as the group fight Shinra forces as they attempt to drop the plate that sits high above the homes of Avalanche and their respective loved ones, our main party makes their daring escape just before being crushed to death. The same can’t be said for Wedge, who falls from the tower that holds the plate, and Biggs and Jessie, who are injured in the fire fight, and eventually crushed by the falling plate. All of their final conversations are deeply emotional, and show a willingness to die that is both moving and upsetting.\n\nGaluf\n\n“Final Fantasy V” (1992)\n\nWhile older Final Fantasy titles like Final Fantasy V may lack the cinematic flair and narrative complexity of their successors, they still manage to evoke strong emotions among fans. I mean, Celes sings a freaking opera in Final Fantasy VI in 8 bits, and I’ve never been more moved in my life. A particularly memorable scene in Final Fantasy V occurs when Exdeath ensnares the party and taunts them. Galuf, in a brave and emotional move, breaks free and confronts Exdeath alone. Even though he knows he can't defeat Exdeath single-handedly, Galuf valiantly endures the onslaught of Exdeath's most powerful spells, persisting in battle even after his own hit points dwindle to zero. It's only after Exdeath retreats that Galuf finally succumbs, having pushed himself past the brink of endurance.\n\nClive\n\n“Final Fantasy XVI” (2023)\n\nIn Final Fantasy XVI, Clive's death is indeed a tragic and emotional moment in the game, from a game that LOVES killing characters off… THIS ISN’T GAME OF THRONES! As the central character, Clive's demise leaves a profound impact on both the player and the story's progression. His loss evokes feelings of sorrow and despair as players witness the end of his journey and the sacrifices he made for his cause. Clive's death serves as a pivotal moment in the narrative, shaping the character’s motivations and driving the storyline forward by using our tears to clear the way.\n\nNoctis\n\n“Final Fantasy XV” (2016)\n\nWe love a sacrifice - Aerith trying to save the world, Biggs and Wedge trying to save the slums, Noctis trying to save everything - Noctis' journey in Final Fantasy XV culminates in a bittersweet conclusion. Knowing he must confront Ardyn in the afterlife, Noctis willingly sacrifices himself to save the world, reuniting with his beloved Lunafreya. However, this decision means leaving behind his loyal friends Ignis, Prompto, and Gladio. The game poignantly portrays their final night together, as Noctis grapples with the weight of their inevitable separation. Despite the reunion bringing him joy, the impending farewell weighs so unbelievably heavy, not only for our four party members, but for us who’ve played alongside them as the silent fifth.\n\nAuron\n\n“Final Fantasy X” (2001)\n\nThere’s been many fights throughout history that have been heavily one sided. In Final Fantasy X, Yunalesca, a formidable and ancient mage in Spira, confronts Auron, a guy with a sword. We’ll give you a minute to place your bets below… Did you guess Auron? You idiot. Yunalesca effortlessly overpowers him, and blinds him in one eye. Despite the odds stacked against him, Auron stubbornly refuses to succumb to defeat. Instead, he implores Kimahri, a fellow guardian, to protect Yuna, the daughter of Braska. This poignant moment not only showcases Auron's unwavering resolve and selflessness but also adds depth to the game's narrative, highlighting themes of sacrifice, duty, and the bonds of friendship that resonate throughout Final Fantasy X. We also have to watch him kind of die again when he is finally sent to the Farplane. We’re running out of tears here.\n\nDyne\n\n“Final Fantasy VII Rebirth” (2024)\n\nThroughout the original Final Fantasy VII, we got the opportunity to take a closer look at our party, and even sometimes fight solo with them as we learn more about their history. Some of the more highly anticipated moments in Final Fantasy Remake and Rebirth have been these solo moments, and Barret’s story was no exception. Finding and confronting Barrett's best friend, who he presumed was dead until this point, is an emotionally heartbreaking moment as his mental state is too far gone to return to a regular life. The emotional rollercoaster of believing your best friend is dead, finding him years later alive, and realizing he’d be better off dead, is one that could only be handled by the man himself: Barret. After we fight Dyne, he is gunned down by Shinra troops, leaving behind his daughter, and laying the burden of his ending onto Barret.\n\nZack Fair\n\n“Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII” (2007)\n\nOf course, we’d already seen Zack’s death in the original Final Fantasy VII, but his death in Crisis Core is SO MUCH worse, as we spend an entire game in his shoes before losing him to his inevitable death. As much as we wished it would change, the game's conclusion remained unaltered. Zack valiantly battles hordes of Shinra soldiers to safeguard Cloud Strife. Despite his formidable prowess, he eventually succumbs to fatal wounds. The game ingeniously incorporates this harrowing sequence into its final gameplay segment, portraying Zack's desperate, weakened struggles in the face of overwhelming odds. This poignant moment encapsulates the essence of Crisis Core's narrative, emphasizing Zack's selflessness and unwavering dedication to protecting those he cares about, particularly Cloud. Getting caught crying into your PSP back in 2007 was a very shameful moment, and I lived it.\n\nCid\n\n“Final Fantasy XVI” (2023)\n\nCid del Norte Marquez plays a significant role in Final Fantasy VI as one of the game's prominent NPCs, deeply intertwined with Celes's narrative arc. After Kefka's cataclysm devastates the world, Cid and Celes find themselves stranded on a desolate island along with other survivors. Over time, as their companions gradually perish, Cid and Celes develop a profound bond, akin to that of a grandfather and granddaughter. When Cid falls ill, Celes assumes the responsibility of catching and feeding him the right fish to sustain his health; failure to do so results in his deterioration and eventual demise. Cid's passing is a poignant moment in itself, but its tragic impact is heightened by the profound grief it induces in Celes, leading her to contemplate suicide as she struggles to cope with the loss of her last remaining connection to hope and companionship.\n\nTidus\n\n“Final Fantasy X” (2001)\n\nNow, TECHNICALLY Tidus was never actually alive, as he was a dream willed into existence by the Fayth, but it’s hard to argue that Tidus's disappearance in Final Fantasy X is depicted with all the emotional weight of a death, represented in Yuna's heart-wrenching reaction. You want to see it? You want to live it? Enjoy crying. A standout moment occurs when she attempts to embrace him, only to pass through his fading form, symbolizing the stark reality of his departure. This scene resonates deeply with fans, often cited as one of the franchise's most memorable moments. While Tidus can return in Final Fantasy X-2, his final scene in Final Fantasy X remains impactful, its emotional intensity unaltered by subsequent events.\n\nAerith\n\n“Final Fantasy VII” (1997)\n\nAerith Gainsborough's demise continues to stand as one of the most iconic moments in Final Fantasy history, marking a pivotal and shocking plot twist in Final Fantasy VII. As Aerith reaches out to the planet, attempting to summon Holy to counter Meteor, Sephiroth intervenes, and STABS HER… PRISON STYLE. The suddenness and gravity of Aerith's death catch players off guard, as the game offers scant foreshadowing of her tragic fate. Prior to this pivotal moment, Aerith is portrayed like any other playable character, even serving as one of two romance options, further deepening the emotional impact of her loss. Aerith's passing casts a somber shadow over the game's remaining cast, leaving a profound and lasting impact on the narrative. This moment continues to stand tall as a dark mark in gaming history, even on our hundredth playthrough."
