        "text": "Itâs been an exceptionally busy year for new video game releases, so weâll forgive you if an ever-growing gaming backlog means you still havenât found the time to play everything you had on your list this year.\n\nThat said, we wouldnât want you to miss out on some of the amazing video game soundtracks that have been released. Last year, we asked video game composers to share their favourite soundtracks of 2022, and with a couple of words on what makes the music in the game theyâve chosen so special.\n\nThey shared so much brilliant stuff that weâve asked them to do the same again, only this time weâve invited more composers along. We hope this gives VGC readers an opportunity to check out some soundtracks you might have missed otherwise, while game composers get to shout out their colleagues in whatâs been one of the roughest years for the industry on record.\n\nIf you want to directly support the work of these composers, Bandcamp waives its revenue share on the first Friday of every month (called Bandcamp Fridays) so an average of 93% of any purchases reaches the artist/label. Indie composers stand to benefit from the most, so weâve left Bandcamp links so you can purchase this music if you enjoy it.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBorislav Slavov\n\n(Baldurâs Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Crysis series)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Jusant by Guillaume Ferran\n\nâThe music of Jusant is peaceful, calm and a very melancholic piece of art â moody in a personal way. It tells me a story without words and makes my heart feel light and full of sadness at the same time.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Bandcamp\n\nJoshua Taipale\n\n(Omega Strikers, Apex Legends: Mobile)\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Master Detective Archives: Rain Code by Masafumi Takada\n\nâItâs a cool electronic/lo-fi soundtrack that really pushes the cyberpunk atmosphere of the game. As a spiritual successor to Danganronpa, its stylistic roots are clear while maintaining a clear identity of its own. My favorite song on the soundtrack is the main theme of Kanai Ward. It has a vibe unlike anything Iâve heard in a game soundtrack.”\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube\n\nEddie Marianukroh\n\n(Chained Echoes)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Decarnation Original Soundtrack (Cauchemar & RÃªve) by Akira Yamaoka, Corentin Brasart, ALT 236, Fleur et Bleue, The Von Bastards\n\nâI canât help but feel that this soundtrack has gone a bit under the radar, as I havenât seen it mentioned very often, so I would like to bring some attention to it.\n\nâThe Cauchemar portion of the OST is filled with beautifully eerie synth soundscapes that masterfully set the tone to the horrors that unfold in-game. On the flip side are the wonderfully catchy French pop tracks (RÃªve) for the cabaret scenes, leading to a surreal juxtaposition that shockingly works perfectly. Overall, the soundtrack is an aural delight to experience, both in-game and standalone, and I canât recommend it enough.\n\nâSome other noteworthy highlights this year for me are the phenomenal soundtrack by Yasunori Nishiki for Octopath Traveler II, Dale Northâs gorgeous score for Astral Ascent, and Matthew Harnageâs heartfelt music for The Ranch of Rivershine. All of these scores absolutely deserve your time.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on Spotify (Cauchemar, RÃªve) or purchase it on Steam (Cauchemar, RÃªve)\n\nAustin WintoryÂ\n\n(Banner Saga, Stray Gods, Journey, Abzu)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Baldurâs Gate 3 by Borislav Slavov\n\nâIn a year stacked floor-to-ceiling with noteworthy releases, I have to go with the most predictable reply of all: Borislav Slavov’s Baldurâs Gate 3. The entire score is lovely, but I choose it specifically because of the wonderful audacity in how the final battle with Raphael is treated musically. So few games/composers have the courage to do something that bizarre and wonderful!”\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on Spotify and YouTube.\n\nMason Lieberman\n\n(PUBG Mobile, Apex Legends Mobile, Game for Peace)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by Manaka Kataoka, Maasa Miyoshi, Masato Ohashi, and Tsukasa Usui\n\nâThis yearâs choice is easy for me, even with the overwhelming wealth of great VGM released this year. I felt Manaka Kataokaâs approach to Breath of the Wild was absolutely inspired, and it felt amazing to revisit that sonic world for her latest, Tears of the Kingdom. This might be controversial, but I sincerely believe it might be the single best Zelda score of all time!\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube until the video is inevitably removed via a DMCA in a few months (weeks?!)\n\nJames LandinoÂ\n\n(PUBG: Mobile, Omega Strikers, Cytus II, No Straight Roads)Â\n\nFavourite game soundtrack of 2023: Bomb Rush Cyberfunk featuring Hideki Naganuma, BXTREME, Kilowatts, SKALP, Klaus Veen, Reso, Ethan Goldhammer, Kidkanevil, Sebastian Knight, 2-Mello, Knxwledge, Grrl, wev, Proux, Olli, Legove, Flamclap, Doctor Lazer, Dom Mclennon, cybermilk, Color Plus, Charody Jeddy, Leopard Davinci & Louis 707.\n\nâWe often forget that some of the best video game music in gaming comes from licensed music. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk combines both original music from dope composers and expertly curated licensed songs from independent artists and blends them into a carefully crafted soundtrack experience.\n\n“Showcasing a wide variety of genres ranging from electronic, dance, hip-hop, funk, disco, and more, this love letter to Jet Set Radio doesnât hold back on bangers. With tracks such as Big City Life, Plume, Operator, In The Pocket, and GET ENUF, this is a unique musical experience that easily goes on my list of best soundtracks of 2023.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and purchase on Steam.\n\nLena RaineÂ\n\n(Celeste, Minecraft, Chicory, Guild Wars 2)Â\n\nFavourite soundtrack of 2023: Void Stranger by eebrozgi\n\nâAs you descend endlessly into the void, the background tracks are perfectly suited to the environment of each successive layer of punishing sokoban puzzle rooms. But it’s not just puzzle solving, as the game unravels and shows you its true form with all its secrets, touching story scenes, multiple endings & b*** b******.\n\n“There is a moment in one of the game’s endings that perfectly pairs music to its hypnotizing gameplay in one of the coolest synergies between game & music since Control‘s Ashtray Maze (only to be outdone by this year’s ‘Herald of Darkness’ segment in Alan Wake II).â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on Bandcamp\n\nRob WestwoodÂ\n\n(Remnant 1 & II, Asgardâs Wrath 1 & II, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Octopath Traveller II by Yasunori Nishiki\n\nâItâs hard to pick just one, but Octopath Traveler 2 has too many moments that scratch an itch in just the right place. Unapologetically driving guitars, soaring trumpet and plenty of folk influence all in one package. Whatâs not to like? I think I found it at the right time. It harkens back to the classic 16-bit RPGs where genres met, bass guitar slapped, and thematic material played out, all with the production values of today.\n\nThat said, I must give a special mention to Tee Lopeâs tracks from Sonic Superstars. Sonic is what got me into video game music in the first place and Tee Lopes nails it every time. Speed Jungle Act 1 is absolute perfection.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on Apple Music\n\nThe Flight (Joe Henson and Alexis Smith)Â\n\n(Alien: Isolation, Horizon Zero Dawn, Assassinâs Creed Odyssey, Horizon Forbidden West)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Under The Waves by Nicolas Bredin\n\nâFirst and foremost, a game score has to be a servant to the story and feeling of the game it adorns. Nicolas Bredinâs haunting soundtrack to Parallel Studio/ Quantic Dreams’ Under The Waves does exactly that, perfectly describing the other-worldly underwater seascapes and crushing loneliness of the protagonist, an enchanting mix of organic and synthesised sounds that flow in and out like the tide.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Bandcamp\n\nSteffen SchmidtÂ\n\n(Palia)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Favourite video game soundtrack of 2023: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by Manaka Kataoka, Maasa Miyoshi, Masato Ohashi, and Tsukasa Usui\n\nâTears of the Kingdom, like its predecessor, has a cutting-edge score that experiments on traditional Zelda themes but creates a fresh perspective and journey for the player. From big sweeping themes driven by orchestral and world instruments to minimalism with organic sounds and electronic elements, you are both not expecting what to hear, but pleasantly surprised at the same time.â\n\nRichard JacquesÂ\n\n(Marvelâs Guardians Of The Galaxy, Mass Effect, Sonic R, Jet Set Radio, Overwatch 2)\n\nFavourite soundtrack of 2023: Starfield by Inon Zur\n\nâThis score is a terrific example of symphonic scoring, featuring highly intelligent and accomplished writing, as well as beautiful orchestrations and, where appropriate, some evocative and effective synth work. There are some wonderful harmonic shifts throughout the score, and in particular, some superb woodwind writing, which is often overlooked in video game scores.\n\nTake the main theme, âInto The Starfieldâ for example. This is the perfect opening theme to an epic space adventure, and truly sets the scene for the story, exploration and action that ensues. The huge scope of the score covers the gameplay perfectly, with musical moods that follow the narrative, all of which are very fitting for the worlds that the player explores. A truly stellar piece of work.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Spotify\n\nYann Cleophas\n\n(Have a Nice Death, Beat Workers)\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Tchia by John Robert Matz\n\nâThe music of Tchia is a sunny, original, and inspired journey that provides real joy and profound emotions. What more could one ask for in a soundtrack! We dive into the musical culture of New Caledonia with compositions by John Robert Matz, performed by local musicians and singers.\n\n“The live recording takes centre stage, featuring acoustic guitar, ukulele, flutes, percussions, and beautiful voices, both solo and chorals. A truly fantastic and highly sensitive work. Bravo!â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Bandcamp\n\nTim Wynn\n\n(Marvel’s Midnight Suns, XCOM 2, The Simpsons)\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Planet of Lana by Takeshi Furukawa\n\nâWith so many amazing scores this year, it’s a nearly impossible task to pick one favourite score for 2023. But something about Takeshi Furukawa’s score for the Planet of Lana resonated with me. It’s a charming score that compliments the gorgeous look of the artwork in the game. His lovely use of colours and melodies in the orchestra takes this game to new heights. Bravo.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Spotify.\n\nCasey EdwardsÂ\n\n(Devil May Cry, Exoprimal, Mortal Kombat 1)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Star Wars Jedi: Survivor by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab\n\nâHaab and Barton return to not just flex their honed orchestral chops that are necessary for writing John Williams-adjacent music, but to also show the Star Wars universe can be more than what weâre used to hearing in the traditional sense They do an incredible job at juggling both old and new original themes and motifs, weaving them in and out to keep us anchored to this specific storyline weâre following.\n\nâThe tracks from additional musicians and bands found as diegetic music in the cantina was also a really cool add-on to this universe. The original Star Wars introduced this idea with the very well-known Cantina band tracks that took a heavy nod at a more popular jazz style from that time period, and itâs nice to see this tradition honoured with a modern touch. Iâm hoping for a third instalment and I canât wait to hear what they cook up next!â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Spotify\n\nGareth CokerÂ\n\n(Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, Halo Infinite, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Disney Illusion Island by David Housden\n\nâThis soundtrack has been criminally overlooked by everybody this year. It’s an immaculate representation of the classic Disney sound packed into a family-friendly game. The production is top-notch with high-quality orchestration but it’s the musical ideas, motifs, and riffs themselves that truly match the ‘theme park’ vibe that this game is clearly going for. It’s a transportation direct into Disney’s world executed at the highest level.\n\nâAnd speaking of immaculate and well-executed scores, I’d be remiss not to mention Star Wars Jedi Survivor by Gordy Haab and Stephen Barton. I also particularly enjoyed Planet of Lana’s score by Takeshi Furukawa and Assassins Creed Mirage by Brendan Angelides.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and SpotifyÂ\n\nShinji HosoeÂ\n\n(Ridge Racer, Zero Escape, Street Fighter EX, Bushido Blade)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Humanity by Jemapur\n\nâA dog leads a willless human being onto an inorganic stage. The music behind them is sometimes inorganic, sometimes dramatic. It is an indifferent feeling different from the organic Lemmings of the past, and the perfect music for this logical game.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Bandcamp.\n\nCaisheng Bo\n\n(Have a Nice Death, Kemono Friends, Magnum Quest)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Hogwarts Legacy by Chuck E Myers, Peter Murray and J Scott Rakozy\n\nâMusic is one of, if not, the most crucial factors of making a magic world truly magical. The soundtrack of Hogwarts Legacy not only delivers a convincing magical experience, but also stands out with complexity and beauty in taste and musicality.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Spotify\n\nYoko KomiyamaÂ\n\n(Monster Hunter series, Mega Man X7/X8, Rockman X Dive)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Final Fantasy XVI by Masayoshi Soken, Takafumi Imamura, Daiki Ishikawa, Saya Yasaki, and Justin Frieden.\n\nâThis work was selected as “Best Score & Music” at this year’s The Game Awards. The composer, Soken-san, has created more than 600 songs since FF14. I am not a good gamer, so I watched my husband’s gameplay from behind and listened to the music while feeling the world of the game, and it was really wonderful. The way the music played was also very pleasant and I would recommend listening to this as a musical piece.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on Apple Music.\n\nLouis Godart\n\n(Blanc, Worlds of Aria, Drifting Lands)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: shapez 2 by Peppsen\n\nâI discovered shapez as an EGS free game at the beginning of 2023 and I immediately fell in love with it: a minimalistic Factorio without any stress or threat â and the music is a big part of that! Composed by Peppsen, it really made the experience smooth, helping me to concentrate but keep motivated at the same time.\n\n“It’s synthy and energetic, but never stressful or aggressive, and thereâs a lot to say about the rhythmic ambiguity in some tracks. With that in mind, I was more than happy to discover that shapez 2 is in early access right now, and after a few hours of playing it, I can really say that Peppsen killed it once again and really pushed his aesthetic forward in order to match the new 3D, sci-fi aspect of shapez 2. I can’t wait to play the full game and hear the full soundtrack!\n\nListen to the first shapez.io soundtrack on YouTube and Bandcamp\n\nCody Matthew Johnson\n\n(Trek to Yomi, Bayonetta, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry) Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Diablo IV by Ted Reedy and Leo Kaliski\n\nâDiablo IV is my personal favorite and stand-out soundtrack from 2023. Iâm drawn so very deeply to the narrative draw and immersive power of soundtracks â with a blink test I need to know exactly where I am, who I am, and why I am. Diablo IV excels at this in a way that the music alone has me coming back to the campaign and each of the regions time and time again.\n\n“The music has a subtly of thematic variation and motif through its ominous orchestrations that never screams âlisten to meâ â itâs guiding us, calling for us to journey deeper and deeper into its story, and subsequentlyâ¦ Hell. I love texture, darkness and slow-burn thematic development and Diablo IV checks all the boxes for what I love in video game music. Bravo to the whole Diablo IV music team!â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Spotify\n\nEric W. Brown\n\n(Sea of Stars, The Messenger)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Marvelâs Spider-Man 2 by John Paesano\n\nâOf all the games I played in 2023, this one stood out for sure. I’m a huge Spider-Man fan already and had this on pre-order as soon as it was announced, but the game definitely exceeded expectations in terms of storytelling, flavour and music. The score really strikes a perfect balance between epic cinematic themes and hip-hop beats, which you don’t really find anywhere else.\n\n“During the DJ sequence with Miles, I got chills at how well that theme was used and had to look up who the composer was so I could fantasize about shaking their hand… It was one of those “epic gamer moments” you only get once in a blue moon.”\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Spotify\n\nJ.D. SpearsÂ\n\n(League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, Chivalry 2)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: The Lamplighterâs League by Jon Everist\n\n“This is a tough call because of all of the amazing stuff that came out this year – but this is the one I keep going back and listening to. From a pure writing perspective itâs brilliant – but for me what puts it over the edge is just how fresh it is. Doing something that feels unique is enough of a challenge; doing something that feels unique AND fits the project perfectly, even more so!\n\n“The way this score is able to move in and out of its film noir (and beyond) influences, blending them seamlessly with more traditional and phenomenal cinematic writing is something to aspire to. Once again, Jon has knocked it out of the park on this one.”\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Bandcamp\n\nBill HemstapatÂ Â Â\n\n(League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, Ghost of Tsushima, Demon’s Souls, Returnal, God of War Ragnarok)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Assassin’s Creed Mirage by Brendan Angelides\n\nâSome may know Brendan’s work as ‘Eskmo’ on the soundtrack of Netflix‘s 13 Reasons Why, but I believe this is his first ever video game soundtrack. Not only does the music honour the middle-eastern cultural expression in truly beautiful and fun ways, but it was also fused with modern elements that make this gameâs score push the boundaries of a long-running franchise forward in the best way possible. A special shout-out to that beautiful rendition of ‘Ezio’s Theme’ featuring Layth Sidiq’s voice, Middle Eastern musical flairs, and a beautiful string writing – chef’s kiss!”\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Spotify\n\nAlexis Laugier\n\n(Have a Nice Death, Road 96, Rayman Mini)Â\n\nFavourite game soundtrack of 2023: Diablo IV by Ted Reedy and Leo Kaliski\n\n“Choosing the best was challenging this year due to the numerous masterpieces, but the soundtrack that truly captivated me was from Diablo 4. I can immerse myself in Leo Kaliski’s Kyovashad theme for hours on end! The dramatic and melancholic tones of this soundtrack resonate perfectly with the Diablo universe. The musical selections seamlessly align with the narrative, and the contrast between exploration phases and boss fights adds a rhythmic intensity to the gameplay, making it truly engaging. Diablo 4’s soundtrack not only elevates gameplay but also evokes powerful emotional connections.”\n\nPaula Ruiz AKA fingerspitÂ\n\n(The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, Gods Will be Watching, The Red Strings Club)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Void Stranger by eebrozgi\n\nâIt was super hard to choose a favorite soundtrack in a year with so many amazing games with outstanding music, but in the end my choice goes to Void Stranger, as it was the one that actually made me cry. Iâve never been a fan of sokoban games and all I can say is that I ended up playing this masterpiece for almost 70 hours, and all of those were accompanied by an absolutely brilliant soundtrack that always nailed it and never felt boring, made me headbang my way through the void and never failed to set the mood, which is an incredible task for such a unique game.â\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on YouTube and Bandcamp\n\nStephen BartonÂ\n\n(Star Wars Jedi: series, Apex Legends, Watch Dogs, Titanfall)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by Manaka Kataoka, Maasa Miyoshi, Masato Ohashi, and Tsukasa Usui\n\nâFor me it was a pretty close toss-up between TOTK and Baldurâs Gate 3. I love Bobbyâs work on that score hugely. Both take an existing world and expand hugely on it. But thereâs a nostalgia button thatâs hit in the Tears of the Kingdom score that really is so very different to anything else â callbacks to Breath of the Wild and earlier games too, whilst still adding new material and new takes on the older material, particularly the location music.\n\n“The erhu and string writing in the main theme is gorgeous. I love that the sensibility of these scores is so different to anything Iâve worked on, and how you only have to hear a second or two of it and you know exactly what it is, and how it sounds great no matter what platform or device youâre playing it on. Thatâs a huge achievement.â\n\nMasayoshi Soken\n\n(Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy XVI)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Alan Wake 2 by Petri Alanko and Poets of the Fall\n\nâI usually listen to a lot of music, but lately, I havenât been listening to game soundtracks on their own. But to bring up some music I heard recently while playing games that surprised me, I would choose the scene where âHerald of Darknessâ plays in Alan Wake 2. Itâs out there to have a gun go off while the music video starts playing all around out of nowhere during the gameplay, and I found that interesting. And on top of that, the MV is made interactive. Nothing to say other than, damn â thatâs cool!â\n\nThe Alan Wake 2 OST isnât online yet but you can check out the Old Gods of Asgard tracks on Spotify here.\n\nDaiki Ishikawa\n\n(Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy XVI, Final Fantasy VII Remake)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Splatoon 3 ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK -Splatune3- by Toru Minegishi, Shiho Fujii, Ryo Nagamatsu, Toshiyuki Sudo, Yumi Takahashi,Â Sayako Doi\n\nâThe background music for the Turf War is my favourite. The world setting dictates that the artists within Splatoon are creating the songs, so I feel the music really approaches the game head-on. Of course, it fulfils the aim of creating excitement within the gameplay properly as well! Songs by the band âC-Sideâ especially have all the cool bits of the rock band sound with its distortion on the guitar and sense of drive overall. I feel like perhaps with all that coolness, my aim gets slightly better when âC-Sideâ songs are playing in a battle, lol!â\n\nBuy the official soundtrack on Amazon or listen to it on YouTube before itâs taken down!\n\nTakafumi Imamura\n\n(Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy XVI, Final Fantasy VII Remake)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim OST\n\nâThe reason Iâve chosen this song on this occasion is that the game 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim has left the biggest impression on me personally in 2023. The game itself was released in 2019, but with everything going on I played it for the first time in 2023. I really wanted to play it earlier, though. This song plays when you play as Natsuno Minami, but I was surprised with how wonderfully well the song matched with the character and the game footage. I really like how the song can make me happy just by listening to it, as well as how it gives off a deeper emotional element in the depths of the song. I hope everyone can try this game out!â\n\nJohn Robert Matz\n\n(For The King, Tchia)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: El Paso, Elsewhere by Lake Savage AKA RJ Lake\n\nâAn absolutely wild descent into madness by composer RJ Lake, fusing synths, hip-hop, rap, and… occasionally chill lo-fi(?) on an unhinged journey into the void beneath a rapidly-unspooling motel in El Paso, Texas where your ex-girlfriend, Draculae, is conducting a world-ending ritual you must stop. The true highlights of the score are the staggeringly good, highly disturbed rap numbers sung by (with lyrics by) the game’s director, Xalavier Nelson, Jr. Highly recommended.\n\nListen to the full soundtrack on Bandcamp\n\nNicklas Hjertberg (Two Feathers)Â\n\n(Metal: Hellsinger, Angry Birds 2, Warhammer Virmintide 2)\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Final Fantasy XVI by Masayoshi Soken, Takafumi Imamura, Daiki Ishikawa, Saya Yasaki, and Justin Frieden.\n\nâThe soundtrack for Final Fantasy XVI has such a fantastic feel and some great standout tracks that I keep coming back to after hearing them for the first time in-game. Tracks like ‘Find the Flame’ and ‘Forevermore’ showcase the soundtrack’s excellent variety of intensities that you will be taken through while playing the game and I canât get enough of it. It might also include one of my favourite final battle themes from the last few years!â\n\nOlivier DeriviereÂ\n\n(Streets of Rage IV, Dying Light 2, A Plague Tale)Â\n\nFavourite video game soundtrack of 2023: Hi-Fi Rush by Shuichi Kobori, Reo Uratani and Masatoshi Yanagi\n\nâHi-Fi Rush was a real breath of fresh air. It took me back to the era of Sega‘s pinnacle. The music is even in sync with all the animations and certain moves â it was an exhilarating experience!â"
