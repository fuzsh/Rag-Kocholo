None of what I can remember. They were all cleverly integrated into the story.\n\nFF8 on the other hand did have one battle where the main character is flying on a ship as the background has some war going on, but I believe this was integrated into the gameplay also.\n\nAlthough I don't think I got further than half of the 2nd disc, I couldn't find any 'epic' battles in FF9.\n\nThe storylines have always been the strength of the FF series and the main reason to play them. This have often meant long and deep cutscenes, FF7 being no less than the rest.\n\nEvery FF game have been epic in scale, and they all have several large key battles important to the story in which the characters play an important part. In theese epic battles there are both clashes between cultures and clashes against huge monstrous entities (monsters that often symbolising something great and important, such as the Weapons of the World in FF7, Sin in FFX, the Eidolons in FF9 etc). FFXII is the only game in the series in which the clash of civilizations plays a greater role than the characters personal storylines, something which was the cause of lots of criticism and something the developers have promised to make sure is not repeated in XIII.\n\n\"Gameplay\" is a word that can mean a lot of different things. While the FF series have been innovative with it's RPG mechanics, they have never put much focus on customability and party tactics (compared with games like Baldurs Gate and Wizardry 8). Usually grinding is the key to beating the tougher opponents, except for the optional battles which are the only ones requiring you to really think about what you are doing. You never really had a chance to actually change the game either, not even in FF7. Compare this with games like Jade Empire and Vampire: Bloodlines which have a whole sea of alternate endings depending on your choices.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Terramax\n\nBut they're NOT. They're all look exactly the same. Never played FF6, but 7, 8 & 9 appeared to differentiate one another with their graphic style, settings and stories.\n\nFF7 = Steampunk, FF8 = modern sci-fi mixed with European military, FF9 = medieval elements.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Terramax\n\nYou've all completely misread and misinterpreted my first post. I said it's all the same. Shelling out money for the same redrawn pretty boys, dumba**e, schmaltzy love triangles and stupid over-the-top battles. “Well presented characters”. That’s the most nonsense on this thread.\n\nFair enough, 2 or 3 like each other is ok I guess. But we're coming up to 13 in the main series, not including all these spin-offs, the amount of money and acclaim these guys have and they still can't be bothered to do something different.\n\nAnd the characters aren't that well presented anymore either. There's very little depth to half of them. I've never found anything relatable to any of the latest instalments.\n\nMy whole point is the series has become a repetitive, subdued anime mess.\n\nLike Anime in general.\n\nFF6 is about the clash between magic and science, old and new, the machines and the spiritual world.\n\nFF7 is indeed about steampunk, but there's more about it than that. In FF7 the planet itself have a life, the lifesource. The \"Weapons\" which you face, for example, are the worlds own soldiers. FF7 rise questions about what responsibilities we have to the planet itself and to protect it from harm. It questions exploiting the planets resources for power and profit when you might end up killing it and yourself in the process.\n\nFF8 are just as you say sci-fi mixed with European military, but it's also a tale about romance and love and a \"highschool drama\".\n\nFF9 takes the series back to it's roots. It's actually the only game from FF6 and beyond that is like the first five games, with black mages, white mages and epic fantasy. But FF9 is also about the difficulties of finding yourself. In FF9 each of the main characters struggle with the meaning of their lives and who they are and they will have to decide who they are going to be.\n\nFFX is difficult to explain without spoiling the plot. By the first glance it's a world tormented by a huge monster known symbolically as \"Sin\". Beneath the surface it is deeply inspired by the real world and modern events and it strongly questions a few aspects of our world, rising a very important warning of who and what we choose to trust.\n\nFFX-2 is inspired by pop-culture and teen mangas. It's a very different experience in that regard.\n\nFFXII is about salvation vs revenge. It's deeply inspired by the Star Wars universe and it's easy to say \"ripoff\".\n\nDespite having similar themes such as moogles and chocobo's, the FF games are very different and unique. I think you are just getting old.\n\n__________________\n\nThe christian message of tolerance falls already in the first commandment.\n\nAs long as mankind divide themselves by iron age philosophies in the quest for world dominion there are no hope for global peace.\n\nLearn the truth about the myth today and maybe our children can be allowed to live in a better world.\n\nLast edited by JemyM; 12-23-2007 at 10:07 AM."
