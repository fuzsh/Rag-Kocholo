        "text": "I had hoped to make this thread way earlier, before the release of Rebirth, but I had to take a break and replay Remake in anticipation. So let's get to it!\n\nOr rather... Let's go back.\n\nIt's E3 time, it's 2006... And Square releases these beauties:\n\nView: https://youtu.be/mDjT2TkHSyQ?si=1MpcNl4PmJTKydbK\n\nView: https://youtu.be/b6At_bb1PNU?si=n869ZyAz0I-l7cgn\n\nNow, I probably don't need to remind you why Sony's E3 2006 presser wasn't the most well-recieved. But man, it had these trailers (and also that masterful MGS4 trailer).\n\nYoung me was very content. Ecstatic even! Although Versus XIII was the thing I was mostly interested in, XIII was still a \"next-gen\" FF.\n\nI couldn't wait. Ignorant of the technical hurdles they had to overcome, the limited time they had and hoping for a return to something like a world map (I mean, 50 GB Blu-Ray discs, amirite?), I read every developer interview. I couldn't wait for any glimpse of the game in motion, horrible famitsu scans, anything.\n\nI probably stared at these types of scans for hours.\n\nSo... Never in a million years did I ever think I'd actually skip a mainline Final Fantasy and especially not this one. And yet, I did.\n\nDid I borrow the game from a friend and try it out? Yes. Multiple times. But I always gave up about 5-6 hours in. I've hated this game for way too many years, for what I felt was the sole reason a franchise I so dearly loved, was in decline.\n\nIn hindsight? I shouldn't have let nostalgia and crazy expectations deprive me of an experience that I probably would've liked quite a bit, had I only been just a little bit more patient and open to something different.\n\nFFXIII was never going to be my favorite Final Fantasy and it wasn't going to light the world on fire. But it's still a great game. It's not the best in the franchise and yes, it is flawed. But I've already said what I need to say on that front, on way too many occasions.\n\nThe game is still uniquely Final Fantasy and a technical achievement, world map or not. It's absolutely stunning, even to this day and especially playing it on my Series X.\n\nI'll also eventually finish up FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns one day.\n\nHere's a RPGFan write-up on the development of the game. I definitely recommend ya'll watch DF's brilliant two-part series covering it all.\n\nThese honestly deserves way more views:\n\nDF Retro: The Final Fantasy 13 Saga - Part 1 - The Original Game Revisited + All Ports Tested!\n\nJohn Linneman teams up with My Life In Gaming's Marc Duddleson to re-examine the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy - every game and every version tested! In this firs...\n\nDF Retro: The Final Fantasy 13 Saga - Part 2 - FF13-2/ Lightning Returns Revisited!\n\nDF Retro's massive collaboration with My Life In Gaming continues with this second part to our Final Fantasy 13 retrospective! Marc Duddleson takes point her...\n\nAs a side note, it also feels like we've come full circle, in a way. Everything young me hoped that FFXIII would be or provide, a lot of the same devs that worked on the XIII-series, have now provided in games like Rebirth.\n\nI am in awe of these devs and their perseverance and I thoroughly regret the vitriol I've spewed about this game throughout the years. I see it all too often, in too many fandoms.\n\nIt's OK to be disappointed.\n\nHow you choose to express your disappointment, especially in this insanely tough industry, is important though.\n\nAny AAA game released in a functioning state is a goddamn miracle and I'm happy the devs never let my kind of vitriol deter them from aiming ever higher and ultimately achieving something I personally never thought I'd ever experience again.\n\nOne thing's for sure, they are better people than me, because I sure as hell couldn't go through all that and listen to idiots like me and still do what they've done.\n\nThey're insanely inspiring. I'll also say something I never thought I'd say, but I honestly think it's true.\n\nWithout FFXIII and all of it's hurdles, there's no Remake or Rebirth.\n\nI'm glad I finally finished it. If you were anything like me, I think you should too.\n\nFabula Nova Crystallis as a whole is such a bizarre and unique idea. To just have this crazy cool lore, and then have several games that interpret various aspects of the lore in very divergent ways just doesn't sound like anything any game publisher anywhere in their right mind would greenlight. But then again Squeenix never seems like they're in a right state of mind lol.\n\nCrazy to think that in the end we got like 5 FNC games, including XV which is just FNC with the serial numbers filed off. I guess there's also the Agito mobile spinoff but it seemed like a quick cashgrab with Type 0 PSP assets.\n\nI love the whole XIII trilogy. The games are all so radically different and one of them still runs like shit on modern PCs but they're all great. From XIII basically being like a command based character action game with the structure of a CoD campaign or something, to XIII-2 being a wide linear open zone theme park JRPG with creature collection channeling Chrono Trigger complete with HD towns, and Lighting Returns being made with the budget of two sticks while somehow being one of Squeenix's most systemically ambitious games ever made even today (while being open world with massive cities and somewhat of a Valkyrie Profile spiritual successor to boot).\n\nStarted a playthrough of Type-0 HD recently, haven't played it fully since the Japanese PSP release iirc and some of the details escaped me. The HD remaster also completely fucks the art style though with some tweaking I feel like I've managed to get it to a nice midpoint with some reshade. For a PSP game it's still wildly impressive just how much content, systems and secrets have been packed into the title.\n\nThese games deserved to be released to a better fanbase. But people weren't open to them at the time. It was an era in which the entire concept of a linear game was an insult, an era in which \"anime\" became synonymous with \"bad\", an era in which people who before and after would eat up fantasy fiction with a hundred made up words but for some reason FFXIII asking you to learn a measly three was some ridiculous ask.\n\nYeah, yeah, the combat system took too long to open up. That's the one complaint I'll give people. But the rest of the bulk of criticism the game got was downright ridiculous. And in the end the only people they played were themselves, because they denied themselves a good time. And we got three of them.\n\n(Because it has to be said or people will misread this, no this isn't about personal tastes. If you just don't like the game but gave it a fair shot, this isn't about you)\n\nAll the XIII games (and Type 0, and XV) kinda overly rely on the datalog if you want to have an insight into the background why of what is happening but it's kinda wild that it got so much flak when now you have people reading vague notes in Dark Souls and theorizing for years about what it all means lol.\n\nHeck even the bulk of XVI's world building still only exists in its datalog lol.\n\nI wish I could finish it like you OP. Gave up two months ago exactly after 22 hours just before reaching Gran Pulse, the furthest I ever got on what was my 6-7th attempt. It's a game I've tried to love for 14 years now but I just can't.\n\nThis time the characters clicked for me atop of what already did: the original world, great story about fighting fate, beautiful art direction that ranged from the music to menus and sound effects. And of course the combat system that's arguably the peak of ATB and stands shoulder to shoulder with the Gambit system of XII for my favorite in any JRPG.\n\nBut the reason I stopped is because I got tired of the combat hallways. The story bits in between are good but not enough to keep me going. It desperately needs something else on a gameplay front to not get me burnt out on the combat.\n\nAnd the story still has its own issues. Because it takes sooooo long to get to know all of our party and for them to accept being branded, it really does feel like the game is JUST getting started at 20 hours in when they rescue Vanille & Sazh and then fight the pope guy. Plus I vastly prefer the sci-fi setting of Cocoon making the impulse to pick it back up just to get to Gran Pulse very weak.\n\nBut I have Lightning Returns for the PS3 coming in the mail tomorrow, brand new for $20 (never played it). So if that disappoints and I still want some Lightning, then I might just resume instead of starting over again.\n\n- XIII is a deeply flawed game that I like more than I don't like. It IS too linear, it does have an overly slow start...but the characters and world building carry it very well. It's also a great foundation for combat that it's sequels and especially the VII Remake trilogy iterate on beautifully.\n\n- XIII-2 is vastly improved in some areas, and a massive step back in others. I HATE the enemy encounter system in this after how XII and XIII improved it, it does some baffling things with most characters. But the gameplay is a huge step up, the monster catching is fun (I can have a Tonberry in my party!!) and the second or third best villain in the entire franchise.\n\n- Lightning Returns has a fun world to traverse, AMAZING towns that never get the credit they deserve, a gimmick that I found really fun once I got past the stress of it all, and an excellent albeit odd evolution of the combat in the previous two games. It also has my favorite version of that overused main villain trope...but then it completely screws over Hope, Sazh, Vanille, Noel, and Lightning as characters for the strangest reasons. A truly wild ending that I can't help but love though...talk about a mixed bag.\n\n- Versus XIII looked like SUCH a cool game with my favorite overall aesthetic and music in the franchise...and it became half a really fun game with a combat system and latter quarter that sink it into the ground.\n\n- I have never played Type-0. It does not look fun to me.\n\nDid I borrow the game from a friend and try it out? Yes. Multiple times. But I always gave up about 5-6 hours in. I've hated this game for way too many years, for what I felt was the sole reason a franchise I so dearly loved, was in decline.\n\nIn hindsight? I shouldn't have let nostalgia and crazy expectations deprive me of an experience that I probably would've liked quite a bit, had I only been just a little bit more patient and open to something different.\n\nThis, for me, was the biggest problem. I've tried to play FFXIII multiple times too, but I also can't get past the fact that I played this game for multiple hours and it still hadn't \"gotten started\". I don't think it's your fault for not having enough patience, I think it's the game's fault for assuming you would have limitless patience.\n\nI am not against deep games that take a long time to master, or complex games that slowly introduce new features as you go, but that wasn't the case here. It just dragged. I quite enjoyed the combat system, but each time a new concept was introduced, you had to do the same battles over and over, and as the game was so linear, there was no other choice.\n\nI know \"opinions\" and everything, but it blows my mind that some in this thread think the story and characters saved FFXIII. I couldn't stand the characters (pretty much any of them, except the dude with a chockobo living in his hair), and the premise of the story was good, but the storytelling was woeful. Cutscenes for days, but you still had to read the codex to understand what was supposed to be happening.\n\nTBH this was the beginning of the end for me and this style of RPG. I enjoyed them once, but they're too long and bloated for me now.\n\nAll the XIII games (and Type 0, and XV) kinda overly rely on the datalog if you want to have an insight into the background why of what is happening but it's kinda wild that it got so much flak when now you have people reading vague notes in Dark Souls and theorizing for years about what it all means lol.\n\nHeck even the bulk of XVI's world building still only exists in its datalog lol.\n\nThe datalog isn't even required to know what's happening in the story. I never touched it on my first playthrough and I followed along just fine. It's there for recaps and extended lore, which is like... objectively good. The complaint never made any sense.\n\nThe linearity of the experience and the terminology are like the least pressing issues imo, and the ones most people wouldn't have a problem with if other parts of it were working for them (as evidenced by a ton of other games). Like, I can't stand the experience because I thoroughly dislike almost all the people in it.\n\nEDIT: And it's basically never an audience issue unless no one goes and plays/sees/reads the thing in the first place. Plenty of people played XIII, and those who did definitely weren't opposed to anime, linearity or fantasy (they're playing Final Fantasy). It just didn't work for a lot of folks.\n\nI specifically said I wasn't talking about people who gave it a chance and didn't like it.\n\nBut you're absolutely wrong to say the things I brought up weren't happening. They did. I saw it with my own eyes. There's a difference between \"I don't like these characters\" and \"what is this falcie lcie shit, makes no sense, why is this such gibberish, why isn't this like mass effect, this anime shit sucks, auto button lol game plays itself more like final hallway lmao\". And I'm sorry but at the time I saw a lot more of the latter than the former. Many people were not engaging with the game in good faith.\n\nBut you're absolutely wrong to say the things I brought up weren't happening. They did. I saw it with my own eyes.

I just think that stuff is a symptom and not the cause (it's like when you're given notes on a WIP - the problem areas identified and fixes suggested are 90% wrong, but the sentiment is important and used to pinpoint the actual point of friction (when someone tells you your third act isn't working and needs changing, the problem is more often buried somewhere in your first)).\n\nFFX before and FF7R after are guilty of some of the same things to a lesser degree, but they don't cop it nearly as hard because folks care a lot less about that stuff/it's not an issue for them when the rest of the package satisfies them.\n\nBasically people are often wrong about why they dislike something, but not about disliking it. Sometimes they won't engage with the thing, but that's super rare when it's an established property imo.\n\nOh, that definitely happened / happens.

Half of them say the gameplay is good but they hate the story/characters, half of them say the story/characters are great but they hate the gameplay. So your suggestion that there are inherent \"problems\" that needed to be fixed doesn't ring true to me at all. I think because you didn't like the game, you're being too charitable towards an attitude that doesn't deserve it.\n\nIf I can counter every bad argument someone makes for why a game \"is objectively bad\" and point out a dozen examples of similar media they like doing the same things, I'm not going to assume \"well they must just not be able to identify what about the game makes it bad\", especially not when the language used was always so vitriolic. Because I read through all the comments, threads, and posts all across the internet of people clearly not actually playing the game and just juming on a bandwagon that was centered around \"this is just more Japanese gibberish, kingdom hearts anime bullshit, these stupid terms, why can't square enix just write normal\" and \"game plays itself, it's just a hallway, linear games suck, why can't they do what mass effect and elder scrolls do\". And I was young and naive enough to engage with those comments and try to say I liked the game, and I was called a loser with shit taste. The late 2000s and early 2010s were fucking miserable for video game discussion online if you were into the Japanese games coming out back then.\n\nFFXIII was my first Final Fantasy AND my first JRPG, I love it dearly for introducing me into the series. Like you said, it's flawed and there are some parts that don't hold up with me today (I don't love the characters and how they're presented in the story). But the lore and world building (yes, I know everyone hates the data log but I LOVED poring over places, events, and creatures), the paradigm system, the music, the aesthetics...they all still hold up and are still amazing today. Cocoon and Gran Pulse are such cool places. I would love a remastered collection someday...\n\nI couldn't wait. Ignorant of the technical hurdles they had to overcome, the limited time they had and hoping for a return to something like a world map (I mean, 50 GB Blu-Ray discs, amirite?), I read every developer interview. I couldn't wait for any glimpse of the game in motion, horrible famitsu scans, anything.\n\nThis was me but for XV! I remember combing the official forums for the game and reading everybody's theories... watching every gameplay snippet and developer diary...I made myself absolutely sick with hype. And then the game came out, and I finished it, and the ending DID make me cry, but the more time passed, the more annoyed I was at the story and the overworld. But it's like you said, making games is difficult and the Nova Crystalis series had a pretty rocky development. One day I will revisit XV with more optimism.\n\nAny AAA game released in a functioning state is a goddamn miracle and I'm happy the devs never let my kind of vitriol deter them from aiming ever higher and ultimately achieving something I personally never thought I'd ever experience again.\n\nHere here!"
