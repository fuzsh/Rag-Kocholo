        "text": "What did these others choose to do?\n\nI always figure all l'cie chose to wait to become monsters, kill themselves, or do as they say. I thought the entire point of the journey and what makes this team so much more important is that they actually tried to defeat their fate rather than give up. Like the way Cid Raines says that it was them that inspired to try to rebel. Or the cieth stones talk about resigning or attempting their ill fated focus. Vanille says something to this affect as well, that there was no hope- and Fang replies that who knows, maybe the reason there is no way out is because no one ever attempted to look for one.\n\nAlthough I agree that there was a lot of the execution poorly done. I always like to compare to FFVIII, in terms of personal taste. I felt FFVIII had a lot of bad ideas brilliantly executed and FFXIII had a lot of brilliant ideas poorly executed (story wise). (And I still really like FFXIII and dislike VII : D)\n\nLindzei being one of them. In fact, the whole god mythology is something you really have to study FFXIII to understand, and even then you've got to wait for the Ultimania for the full details. I didn't even get there was another god Lindzei, until later. And I thought Hallowed Pulse was the same thing as Etros. But despite the fact that Lindzei was the god that sort of created Cucoon, it was Hallowed Pulse they were trying to summon back. But Cucoon was created to bring back Hallowed Pulse, so was Lindzei just fucking with their head, and if he wasn't why would he create Cucoon? And is Etros still around?\n\n...Who's Lindzei? The Maker?\n\nSplintered said:\n\nalways figure all l'cie chose to wait to become monsters, kill themselves, or do as they say.

Vanille says something to this affect as well, that there was no hope- and Fang replies that who knows, maybe the reason there is no way out is because no one ever attempted to look for one.\n\nAnd when I say the game had an awesome world and an 'eh' story, this is what I mean. This is what frustrated me during the game.\n\nThere were several instances of this happening: Realizing they're being played, and then decide to defy the fate that's using them. And how do they do this? But doing the EXACT SAME THING they had been doing. I never understood it and they just kept doing it. If nothing's going to change, why do they keep bringing it up?\n\nThe first case I can remember are when Lightning and Hope come across Carbuncle. Something happens that makes Lightning realize they're being used and says she won't play into their hands. Do you change direction? Do you STOP killing things? ...nope, you keep going the same direction with the same goal yo had before the cutscene.\n\nAnd the big one, of course, they are told many times throughout the game by Barthandelus that he wants them to kill Orphan. They refuse to be his pawns and, what do they do? Kill Orphan. Not through any trickery on Barthandelus' part, really (besides pretending to send the Cavalry to do it), the l'Cie just went down there and did exactly what he wanted. The only thing that was different was that they killed Orphan themselves without turning into Ragnarok...but it had the same effect...\n\n...still bugs me. Am I missing some massive piece that makes all this make sense?\n\n...Who's Lindzei? The Maker?\n\nThere are three gods, Hallowed Pulse, which created Pulse, Etros- who is in Versus and the reason why l'cie can summon, and Lindzei. Everyone is kind of straight forward except for Lindzei, he's painted in the Analects as a \"trickster god\" but it's kind of hard to tell because everything written there is horribly biased.\n\nHe either made Cucoon and other fal'cie followed him, or he convinced Barthandelus to make Cucoon. I even read it in this thread once that some people believed he was Lindzei.\n\ndecide to defy the fate that's using them. And how do they do this? But doing the EXACT SAME THING they had been doing. I never understood it and they just kept doing it. If nothing's going to change, why do they keep bringing it up?\n\nThe only different was the position of wills. They still made Ragnarok, but Ragnarok wasn't created by fear and hatred like most l'cie would make it, it was created by hope (because lol jrpg) and therefore what they could do changed.\n\nThat and they didn't know killing Barthandelus signals Orphan. I figured that they just went to kill him and look for another solution. But ended up creating Orphan and since there was no way out, they were forced to kill it. Plus if they didn't get Barthandelus, he would just curse another l'cie to do what they are suppose to do, and they wanted to stop the cycle right there and bring down the Sanctum.\n\nThey also tried to find out what to do while their time in Pulse. Oerba, irrc, was suppose to be their last ditch effort before finally storming Eden.\n\nIt doesn't make much sense but in their story, it was the only thing they could do unless they gave up, and they already promised not to do that mid game.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe first case I can remember are when Lightning and Hope come across Carbuncle. Something happens that makes Lightning realize they're being used and says she won't play into their hands. Do you change direction? Do you STOP killing things? ...nope, you keep going the same direction with the same goal yo had before the cutscene.\n\nRight after they leave Carbunble is when they arrive at Palumpolum. Even if she did want to change direction, it only makes sense that they leave the factory. Immediately after that is when they almost get captured and get split up, and the following scenes are them trying to reunite. And after that get Sazh back. I don't think Lightning was actually trying to still take down the Fa'lcie.\n\nThis is probably beating a dead horse, but I'm severely confused. I thought Lindzei was just the Pulsian (is that how you'd say it?) name for Bathandelus. Are you saying they're actually two seperate beings, one a god and another a fal'Cie? I read the Analects and really thought Barthandelus was just pulling more of his bullshit trickery and getting a name change before moving up to Cocoon\n\nThat's one theory and there is some of the story that supports this, but imo, there's evidence that shows otherwise.\n\nLuminous lamented, for creation spiraled unto doom.\n\nStout fashioned earth, that future might take root.\n\nSage turned mind's eye inward, seeking truth profound.\n\nFool desired naught, and soon was made one with it.\n\nMaker forged fal'Cie, from fragments Maker's own.\n\nMaker forged Man, from traces once Divine.\n\nIn time the gods departed, leaving all by their hands wrought.\n\nFal'Cie were as Man forsaken, orphans of Maker absconded.\n\nThere are three gods that are explicitly mentioned in FFXIII Analects (well, maybe four), but Lindzei is always referred to as a god (Him being Fool). Hiro's translation affirms it\n\nso on the right side of the 1st form I included a face that looked like Barthandelus. The mother on the left side is god Lindzei (the god that had the fal'Cie create Cocoon/ >P.198) as Dysley envisioned it\n\nSo not only is Dysley not Lindzei, but Dysley also sort of reveres her- as seen by the fact that he envisions Lindzei as a motherly being. Interesting because Lindzei is painted almost like the devil in Pulse.\n\nEither Lindzei or Dysley created Cucoon from Pulse, or they are the same, I'm not really sure. All I know is that Lindzei also apparently left.\n\nMy personal opinion is that of the three gods, Hallowed Pulse left first, leaving the fal'cie to run things for him/her. Keeping with the theme of abandoned children, the Fal'cie wanted to find their god again,\n\nWe've long held the goal of the fal'Cie's endless excavations to be the expansion of the world's inhabitable space-the creation of new lands with which to honor the gods. But I contend this to be false. Their methods lack the order one would expect if that were their purpose, and what's more, they gods they would honor have long since departed this world.\n\nI propose a different explanation: the fal'Cie are hunting. Whether they seek a way to recall the gods or to journey to their side I cannot say, but I do believe the fal'Cie seek their lost deities. They search the earth, the skies, the waters, and even the deep places, seeking a gateway to the Divine.\n\nLindzei convinced Dysley that the only way to do it, was kill billions/millions of people at once- so Dysley and other fal'cie created Cucoon. They told everyone it was a paradise so everyone would live there. And because Cucoon was still technically for the people, it didn't contradict their own focus. Lindzei left soon after.\n\nHe's being manipulated by Lindzei, but it could very well be true. One Analect believes that when humans die, they go to the same place as their god. If many die, that door would be wide open.\n\nWhen our earthly vessels meet their end, the souls they housed must leave this world. Would the path of their migration not be the same one as our departed gods? Must they not pass through the same doorway the Divine employed to reach that place that lies beyond?\n\nIf this is the case, it stands to reason that, should a great many lives at once be cut short, a flood of souls would surge through the aforementioned portal. The Door would be thrown wide, and perhaps we might even glimpse the gleaming light of Divinity beyond.\n\nEtros is the only one who doesn't create anything, she's the one that pities L'Cie and not only gives them summons to show them their way, but takes an active hand in saving Cucoon by crystalizing Fang and Vanille before they could complete their focus\n\nHer Providence sought nothing.\n\nHer Providence made nothing.\n\nShe but looked on, silent in Her sorrow.\n\nThe Goddess pitied mortals, destined as they were to die, and so She deigned to intervene in the hour of their greatest peril. She averted cataclysm that was to be, and put to rest the ones who would have robbed so many of what time fate had ordained.\n\nHer compassion did not end at this.\n\nThe Goddess pitied also those subjected to that fate of Focus, crueler still than death. To them She sent Her messengers, to deliver hope when all was lost.\n\nRagnarok took wing; made to smite Cocoon, and thereby deliver us our everlasting peace. But Her Providence would not let it be.\n\nThe Goddess pitied the fools who so blindly bowed to Lindzei's will, and so She robbed Ragnarok of power, putting the l'Cie to an early crystal sleep, Focus yet incomplete.\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nThen again, this is a really biased tale told from an anti Cucoon stance.\n\nWhy would Lindzei want to create Cucoon, I have no idea. Analects seem to say he's just an asshole like that, but it's never really stated. There's also a description about the ark in the game that says that it's actually something to fight an enemy \"beyond\" and maybe that's a reason. But who knows.\n\nI still have no clue if the Pulse and Cucoon fal'cie were in on the whole thing together, or that they have similar goals but really do hate each other. I also got the impression that a lot of fal'cie just don't care, ie Titan. They're just doing their job."
