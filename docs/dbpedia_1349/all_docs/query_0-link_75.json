From the Ark, Hope will guide Lightning through her journey as the world’s Savior – instructing her on the ways of Nova Chrysalia as well as giving her a place to rest when the day is done.\n\nThe video is in Japanese, but those familiar with the events of the previous two titles should be able to at least glean some sort of understanding from it."
