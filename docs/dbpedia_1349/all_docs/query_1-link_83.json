        "text": "Introduction to Literature\n\nThe Nature and Function of Literature\n\nWe need to approach any piece of writing with the right expectations, based on the kind of writing that it is. The expectations that we should bring to any work of literature are the following.\n\nThe subject of literature. The subject of literature is human experience, rendered as concretely as possible. Literature should thus be contrasted to expository writing of the type we use to conduct the ordinary business of life. Literature does not aim to impart facts and information. It exists to make us share a series of experiences. Literature appeals to our image-making and image-perceiving capacity. A famous novelist said that his purpose was to make his readers see, by which he meant to see life.\n\nThe universality of literature. To take that one step further, the subject of literature is universal human experience—what is true for all people at all times in all places. This does not contradict the fact that literature is first of all filled with concrete particulars. The particulars of literature are a net whereby the author captures and expresses the universal. History and the daily news tell us what happened; literature tells us what happens. The task that this imposes on us is to recognize and name the familiar experiences that we vicariously live as we read a work of literature. The truth that literature imparts is truthfulness to life—knowledge in the form of seeing things accurately. As readers we not only look at the world of the text but through it to everyday life.\n\nAn interpretation of life. In addition to portraying human experiences, authors give us their interpretation of those experiences. There is a persuasive aspect to literature, as authors attempt to get us to share their views of life. These interpretations of life can be phrased as ideas or themes. An important part of assimilating imaginative literature is thus determining and evaluating an author’s angle of vision and belief system.\n\nThe importance of literary form. A further aspect of literature arises from the fact that authors are artists. They write in distinctly literary genres such as narrative and poetry. Additionally, literary authors want us to share their love of technique and beauty, all the way from skill with words to an ability to structure a work carefully and artistically.\n\nSummary. A work of imaginative literature aims to make us see life accurately, to get us to think about important ideas, and to enjoy an artistic performance.\n\nWhy the Classics Matter\n\nThis book belongs to a series of guides to the literary classics of Western literature. We live at a time when the concept of a literary classic is often misunderstood and when the classics themselves are often undervalued or even attacked. The very concept of a classic will rise in our estimation if we simply understand what it is.\n\nWhat is a classic? To begin, the term classic implies the best in its class. The first hurdle that a classic needs to pass is excellence. Excellent according to whom? This brings us to a second part of our definition: classics have stood the test of time through the centuries. The human race itself determines what works rise to the status of classics. That needs to be qualified slightly: the classics are especially known and valued by people who have received a formal education, alerting us that the classics form an important part of the education that takes place within a culture. This leads us to yet another aspect of classics: classics are known to us not only in themselves but also in terms of their interpretation and reinterpretation through the ages. We know a classic partly in terms of the attitudes and interpretations that have become attached to it through the centuries.\n\nWhy read the classics? The first good reason to read the classics is that they represent the best. The fact that they are difficult to read is a mark in their favor; within certain limits, of course, works of literature that demand a lot from us will always yield more than works that demand little of us. If we have a taste for what is excellent, we will automatically want some contact with classics. They offer more enjoyment, more understanding about human experience, and more richness of ideas and thought than lesser works (which we can also legitimately read). We finish reading or rereading a classic with a sense of having risen higher than we would otherwise have risen. Additionally, to know the classics is to know the past, and with that knowledge comes a type of power and mastery. If we know the past, we are in some measure protected from the limitations that come when all we know is the contemporary. Finally, to know the classics is to be an educated person. Not to know them is, intellectually and culturally speaking, like walking around without an arm or leg.\n\nSummary. Here are four definitions of a literary classic from literary experts; each one provides an angle on why the classics matter. (1) The best that has been thought and said (Matthew Arnold). (2) “A literary classic ranks with the best of its kind that have been produced” (Harper Handbook to Literature). (3) A classic “lays its images permanently on the mind [and] is entirely irreplaceable in the sense that no other book whatever comes anywhere near reminding you of it or being even a momentary substitute for it” (C. S. Lewis). (4) Classics are works to which “we return time and again in our minds, even if we do not reread them frequently, as touchstones by which we interpret the world around us” (Nina Baym).\n\nHow to Read a Story\n\nParadise Lost, like the other classics discussed in this series, is a narrative or story. To read it with enjoyment and understanding, we need to know how stories work and why people write and read them.\n\nWhy do people tell and read stories? To tell a story is to (a) entertain and (b) make a statement. As for the entertainment value of stories, it is a fact that one of the most universal human impulses can be summed up in the four words tell me a story. The appeal of stories is universal, and all of us are incessant storytellers during the course of a typical day. As for making a statement, a novelist hit the nail on the head when he said that in order for storytellers to tell a story they must have some picture of the world and of what is right and wrong in that world.\n\nThe things that make up a story. All stories are comprised of three things that claim our attention—setting, character, and plot. A good story is a balance among these three. In one sense, storytellers tell us about these things, but in another sense, as fiction writer Flannery O’Connor put it, storytellers don’t speak about plot, setting, and character but with them. About what does the storyteller tell us by means of these things? About life, human experience, and the ideas that the storyteller believes to be true.\n\nWorld making as part of storytelling. To read a story is to enter a whole world of the imagination. Storytellers construct their narrative world carefully. World making is a central part of the storyteller’s enterprise. On the one hand, this is part of what makes stories entertaining. We love to be transported from mundane reality to faraway places with strange-sounding names. But storytellers also intend their imagined worlds as accurate pictures of reality. In other words, it is an important part of the truth claims that they intend to make. Accordingly, we need to pay attention to the details of the world that a storyteller creates, viewing that world as a picture of what the author believes to exist.\n\nThe need to be discerning. The first demand that a story makes on us is surrender—surrender to the delights of being transported, of encountering experiences, characters, and settings, of considering the truth claims that an author makes by means of his or her story. But we must not be morally and intellectually passive in the face of what an author puts before us. We need to be true to our own convictions as we weigh the morality and truth claims of a story. A story’s greatness does not guarantee that it tells the truth in every way.\n\nIntroduction to Paradise Lost\n\nParadise Lost: The Book at a Glance\n\nAuthor. John Milton (1608–1674)\n\nNationality. English\n\nDate of first publication. 1667; second edition 1674\n\nApproximate number of pages. 250 (varies widely from one edition to the next, depending on size of page and quantity of notes)\n\nAvailable editions. Numerous, including Modern Library Classics, Penguin, Barnes and Noble, Oxford World’s Classics, Dover Thrift, Macmillan, Norton\n\nGenre. Epic poetry\n\nSetting for the story. Four main stages of action: Hell, Heaven, Paradise\n\nbefore the fall, earth in its fallen state\n\nMain characters. Adam and Eve are the human protagonists; God the Father and God the Son; Satan, the epic antagonist; the angel Raphael, who visits Adam and Eve to tell them about war in Heaven, the fall of Satan, and God’s creation of the earth; the angel Michael, who after the fall narrates an extended vision of fallen human history (an epic convention)\n\nPlot summary. In prehistorical heavenly existence, Satan is seized with envy of the exaltation of the Son, so he instigates a rebellion against the Father that is joined by one-third of the angelic host. Satan loses the war in Heaven and is cast down into Hell. God compensates for this loss by creating the world, including Adam and Eve. The story highlights the state of innocence of the first couple in the perfect garden of Eden. Both Eve and Adam succumb to temptation to eat the forbidden fruit in Paradise, and the result of this act of disobedience is the fall of the entire cosmos and the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden. A preview of fallen human history gradually moves toward the atonement of the Son for human sinners, and Adam and Eve leave the garden as a redeemed pair.\n\nStructure. (1) This is a story of crime and punishment, so the plot unfolds in three phases—the antecedents of the crime (what led up to it), its occurrence, and its consequences. (2) With a little streamlining, we can view the poem as proceeding by pairs of books: 1–2, Satan and the fallen angels in hell; 3–4, Adam and Eve in Paradise; 5–6, war in Heaven; 7–8, creation of the world; 9–10, the fall of the human race into sin; 11–12, vision of future history. (3) A vast system of contrasts organizes the entire work: good vs. evil, Satan vs. God, obedience to God vs. disobedience to him, light vs. darkness, high vs. low, before the fall vs. after the fall.\n\nCultural context. Two great cultural streams combine in the work of Milton. One is the Renaissance, a rebirth of classical culture and of the intellectual outlook known as humanism (the striving to perfect all human possibilities in this life). The Renaissance valued beauty and the arts very highly, and its ethical outlook stressed the importance of reason and order. In England the Protestant Reformation went hand-in-hand with the Renaissance. Leading traits of the Reformation included acceptance of the Bible as the final authority for belief and conduct, and living by the premise of the primacy of the spiritual. The English branch of the Reformation is known as Puritanism, which got its name chiefly from the desire of its adherents to purify the Church of England of its remaining vestiges of Catholicism. All Renaissance writers assumed that there were three main topics about which to write: God, people, and nature.\n\nCosmology and world picture. Paradise Lost is an epic, and an important feature of epic is that it portrays the whole cosmos as the author and his culture conceived it. The cosmology of Paradise Lost is the same as in the Bible. It assumes a three-tier universe consisting of Heaven, Earth, and Hell. These are both physical places and spiritual realities. Combining with this view of the cosmos was something called the great chain of being, which was an obsession for the Renaissance and for Milton. The great chain of being was a metaphor that expressed the following beliefs about the universe: (1) its unity; (2) its orderliness; (3) its hierarchy of value. Hierarchy depends on every link in the chain ruling over subordinates and submitting to superiors. Applied at a moral and psychological level, hierarchy depends on reason controlling one’s emotions and appetites.\n\nPlace in English literature. Paradise Lost is the greatest epic in the English language and one of the central texts of English literature. If readers of English literature know just one epic, it is this one. Milton wrote it after he became totally blind.\n\nTips for reading. (1) Settle down for a slow and leisurely read. For one thing, this is a story told in poetic form. Not until the rise of the novel in the middle of the eighteenth century did the human race prefer its long stories to be told in prose. Poetry is a meditative form in which we need to ponder the details. You cannot read Paradise Lost as quickly as you read a novel. (2) Placing a second layer of demands on you is the fact that Paradise Lost is an epic. Epic is the grandest and most exalted form of story. It requires you to relish how the writer expresses the content and not pay attention only to what is said. (3) Paradise Lost is both poetry and story; it is important not to allow the poetry to obscure the ordinary narrative elements of plot, characterization, and setting. (4) Whenever you find the reading hard to follow, start to read the lines aloud. (5) If you want an in-depth experience of Milton’s masterpiece but choose not read the entire poem, here are the must-read sections of the poem: Book 1; Book 2, lines 1–505; Book 3, lines 1–415; Book 4, lines 1–775; Book 9; Book 12, lines 552–649.\n\nAudiobook\n\nFrontmatter\n\nPublic Domain LibriVox Recording\n\nThe Author and His Faith\n\nJohn Milton (1608–1674) was born into a prosperous middle-class family in London. He was a child prodigy whose father gave him the best education imaginable: St. Paul’s School (one of the famous grammar schools of the Renaissance, located right in Milton’s neighborhood), private tutors, Cambridge University, and five years after college for self-education. As a result, Milton is the most learned of English writers. In addition to being a famous author, Milton spent a twenty-year interval in the prime of his life as a famous public and political figure. Near the beginning of this time, Milton became totally blind. He wrote his three major works—Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes— after his public career had ended.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation. The religious context into which Milton and his writings fit is the Protestant Reformation, which was a century old by the time Milton wrote. The central tenet of Protestantism is that the Bible alone is the final authority for religious belief and conduct. From this flow the main doctrines of the movement: God’s creation of the world and providence over it, the sinful state into which all people are born, and faith in the substitutionary atonement of Jesus as the means of salvation. These doctrines and more form the intellectual foundation of Milton’s writings, including Paradise Lost.\n\nPuritanism. The English branch of the Protestant Reformation is known as Puritanism, which began as a church movement intended to purify (hence the name Puritan) the Church of England of its remaining Catholic vestiges. Milton is “a Puritan of Puritans.” Some specific emphases of English Puritanism within the broader context of European Protestantism include an extraordinary immersion in the Bible, an obsession with vocation and work, affirmation of marriage and of sex within it, and the primacy of the spiritual (even though the physical is regarded as good in principle). These traits are conspicuous in Paradise Lost.\n\nParadise Lost as a religious poem. While readers with Christian sensibilities and biblical knowledge can find an abundance of Christian elements in the writings of authors such as Shakespeare and Hawthorne, non-Christian readers find it possible to read them with minimal attention to the Christian aspects. Milton stands in contrast to this. As C. S. Lewis put it, Milton’s poetry does not exist apart from his theology. Milton himself said that in writing the great English and Christian epic he intended to write a poem “doctrinal and exemplary to a nation.” Paradise Lost is a complete repository of biblical truth and Christian doctrine. As for the claims of revisionist scholars that Milton was heretical in his thinking, any ordinary reader will be hard pressed to find any hint of heresy in Paradise Lost. Most of what the debunkers claim as heresy is taken straight from the Bible, such as the title “only begotten Son” for Christ.\n\nParadise Lost as Epic and Anti-Epic\n\nParadise Lost belongs to a small, elite category of stories known as epics. The Greek poet Homer started the Western epic tradition, and Milton brought it to a close with Paradise Lost. Epics are long narrative poems. They are the most exalted kind of story and poem, and they are accordingly written in what is called the “high style.” Starting with Homer, moreover, all epics incorporate a set of conventional patterns or motifs. For example, epic poets invoke the muses or (if the poet is a Christian) God to aid them as they compose. They begin their story in medias res (“in the middle of things”) and later in the story fill in earlier events in their overall story. Supernatural beings are prominent in the cast of characters; epics do not employ realism the way a novel does, so we should not be looking for it.\n\nWe should open the pages of Paradise Lost looking for grand themes in the grand style (as with Handel’s Messiah). Milton’s epic style is so exalted that it reads like a language all its own. Some features of Milton’s high style that we can relish include the following:\n\nlong, flowing sentences that are best understood and enjoyed when read aloud\n\ninversion of normal word order ( e.g., “Him the Almighty hurled flaming from the ethereal sky.”)\n\nexalted vocabulary (“big words,”often derived from the Latin language)\n\nepithets (titles for persons or things, such as “the Almighty” for God)\n\nepic similes (extended comparisons between something in the poem and something from nature, history, mythology, or human experience)\n\nallusions (references to past history or literature)\n\npleonasm or periphrasis (taking more words than necessary to state\n\nsomething, with a view toward doing justice to the exaltation of the situation and epic form)\n\nAs we read Paradise Lost, we are aware at every turn that we are reading an epic in the mode of Homer’s Odyssey or Virgil’s Aeneid. The epic exaltation and features of style are all present. But at the level of content and system of values, Milton revolutionized the classical epic so completely that Paradise Lost is also an anti-epic that refutes the earlier tradition. Classical epic is humanistic in its values. More specifically, it elevates the conquering warrior, physical strength, and earthly success to supremacy. Milton substitutes the Christian saint for the warrior hero as his ideal, and he makes obedience to God the highest value. For the praise of humans, Milton substitutes the praise of God. He also elevates domestic values (marriage and family) and pastoral values (living simply in harmony with nature) over what had always been called heroic values (the success of the military hero and the splendors of earthly kingdoms).\n\nPreliminary Considerations\n\nFormat. Paradise Lost is sufficiently different from other classics covered in this series that it has required modifications in format. Milton’s epic is divided into twelve books, but these are not accompanied by titles the way chapters in a novel are usually given a title at the beginning of each chapter. In keeping with Milton’s design, this guide does not supply titles for the books of Paradise Lost.\n\nSecond, the twelve books of Paradise Lost are longer and more complex than (for example) the twenty-four books of The Odyssey or the twenty-four chapters of The Scarlet Letter. As a result, there is too much material in the individual books of Paradise Lost to allow for the simple format of plot summary, commentary, and reflection/discussion applied to an entire book of Paradise Lost. This guide retains the standard format of an opening unit of plot summary for the entire book that follows, but after that the material is divided into a series of individual units, arranged sequentially according to how the book unfolds from beginning to end. Each of these units has the customary section of commentary followed by a section of reflection and discussion.\n\nChristian vs. non-Christian readers. Readers always respond to works of literature in terms of who they are and what they bring to the text in terms of their own values and worldview. But Paradise Lost is in a category by itself in this regard. There is a long tradition, still dominant in the secular classroom, that claims that Satan is the sympathetic hero of Paradise Lost and God the unsympathetic villain. Secondary claims then accompany this major premise, because Milton portrays Adam as the head of the family, Milton is a misogynist (hater of women).\n\nChristian readers of this guide should turn a deaf ear to these claims. The claims come from readers who are hostile to Christianity. Milton took his materials from the Bible, and Christian readers surely operate from the same premise. Non-Christian readers misread the Bible in the same ways that they misread Paradise Lost. There is so much good and edifying material in Paradise Lost that Christian readers should concentrate on it in a spirit of celebration. They should refuse to allow themselves to be diverted from relishing a Christian poem by the claims of readers who operate from a non-Christian orientation.\n\nBook 1\n\nPlot Summary\n\nMilton launches his epic venture with an exalted opening invocation in which he (1) prays to God for assistance, and (2) announces his epic subject (the fall of humankind into sin), along with the interpretive slant that he will take toward this story material (to assert God’s providence in human affairs despite the presence of evil in the world). The main action in Book 1 is Satan and his fallen legion rousing themselves from the burning lake after having fallen from Heaven for nine days and nights after their unsuccessful rebellion against God. This central action begins with an exchange of speeches between Satan (the first to revive after the physical fall into Hell) and Beelzebub.\n\nAfter this dramatic exchange, Satan calls to his followers to move from the burning lake to land. Just as Homer has a roll call of warriors who participated in the Trojan War, Milton gives us a roll call of the fallen angels who exited the burning lake and came to attention before their commander Satan. Satan appears at his very grandest in the entire story as he addresses his followers. The fallen angels respond by hurling defiance against God and by building the demonic city of Pandemonium.\n\nThis brief plot summary might convey the impression that not much happens in Book 1. But this is untrue. An epic places no premium on keeping us in suspense about what is going to happen (in fact, epic poets usually let us know beforehand what is going to happen). We need to concentrate on how the poet tells his story. Milton pulls out all the stops in the first book of Paradise Lost.\n\nAudiobook\n\nBook 1\n\nPublic Domain LibriVox Recording\n\nThe Opening Invocation lines (1–26)\n\nThe first thing we need to grasp about Milton’s epic is that virtually everything in it is bigger and better than it had been in previous epics. Homer and Virgil gave a nod to the muses, but their invocations are over nearly as soon as they begin. By contrast, Milton pours so much into his opening invocation (the first of four in Paradise Lost) that it takes on a life of its own.\n\nMilton follows all the rules of the epic genre in this invocation. Epics begin with ritual, and so does Paradise Lost. An epic poet begins by announcing his epic theme or subject; Milton declares that he will tell the story of the fall of the human race through disobedience (lines 1–3). Within the broadly stated epic subject, the epic poet then hints at how he will treat his story material; Milton lets us know that in his story Christ will restore what Adam and Eve lost (lines 4–5) and that he will show how, despite the fact of evil and suffering in the world, God is not to blame for that suffering and in fact is exerting a benevolent providence over events on earth (lines 24–26). An epic poet also signals his dependence on supernatural beings (the “muses”) to guide him in the task of composition; Milton amplifies this into a threefold prayer to (1) the God who inspired Moses to write primeval history (lines 6–10), (2) the God of the temple on Mount Zion (lines 10–16), and (3) God the Spirit who created the world (lines 17–23).\n\nBut even though Milton’s opening lines unfold as an epic is supposed to unfold, other things are going on that make Milton’s story the opposite of a conventional epic. Traditional epic is a success story; Milton’s story is a story of human failure (“of man’s first disobedience”). Second, the frame of reference in the Western epic tradition is that of classical mythology, and the classical epic poets accordingly invoke a pagan muse; Milton loads his threefold prayer with references to the Christian God. Third, traditional epic focuses on a conquering hero; Milton’s epic protagonist is the archetypal sinner.\n\nAlso revolutionary is the theological purpose that Milton sets forth at the end of the invocation. The story of the fall being Milton’s subject, his interpretive slant toward that story material is to “justify the ways of God to men.” The technical name for this is theodicy—the attempt to reconcile the goodness and omnipotence of God with the fact of evil and suffering in the world. The Old Testament book of Job is a theodicy; Paradise Lost is like the book of Job in its greatness of literary form and its theological substance.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nMilton’s grand style, fully evident from the opening line, is worthy of attention and enjoyment all by itself. Primary epic (as scholars call it) was oral in nature, and the whole occasion of nobles listening to a poet chant his story in the great hall of a palace helped to create an atmosphere of grandeur. Secondary epic, read by an individual reader in solitude, requires an even grander style to compensate for the informality of the occasion. Now the style itself, claimed C. S. Lewis, must do what the whole occasion helped Homer to do. Lewis speaks of “the true epic exhilaration” that Milton’s style produces, and he claims that the opening lines of Paradise Lost give him a physical sensation that “some great thing is now about to begin.”\n\nIn this invocation Milton claims that he will “soar above the Aonian mount,” by which he means that he will surpass what the epic poets in the classical tradition had done. In other words, the classical epic tradition is not only a model to be emulated but a rival to be surpassed and ultimately refuted. The opening phrase—”Of man’s first disobedience”—already announces a revolution: Milton will not write about a victory but about a defeat.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThe function of the opening invocation is to provide a preview of things that will characterize the poem to follow. The opening invocation gives us the equivalent of a series of billboards along an interstate. The best way to approach Milton’s opening invocation is to treat it as an entry into Paradise Lost. We can proceed sequentially and piecemeal through the invocation, spinning out a series of generalizations about things we now know about the poem that is to follow. For example, it is obvious that Milton will give us a biblical and Christian version of what epic poets in the classical tradition gave us. If we look carefully, we can identify a dozen or more things that we know about the poem to follow (e.g., it will be a partly tragic epic; it will not, however, be an ultimately depressing story; it will be loaded with biblical allusions).\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nIt is not necessary to deny everything that secular readers claim about Milton’s Satan; all that is required is that we do not mistake partial truth for the whole truth. At one level, Milton’s Satan is grand; that does not make him good or sympathetic. A literary critic named Stanley Fish claims that Milton uses the technique of the guilty reader. This means that he carefully contrives to get readers to be swayed by Satan and then inserts data into the text that gets them to see that these responses are shoddy and evil. We are “surprised by sin” (a phrase in Paradise Lost and the title of Fish’s book) as we read, confronted with evidence of our own fallen condition. In fact, with these wrong responses we reenact the fall ourselves.\n\nA good organizing strategy that will unify our experience of Book 1 is to complete the formula “images of . . .”—images of defeat, of evil, of pain, of confusion, of irrevocable loss, and so forth. Having completed the list, it will be evident that we do not admire these things in real life, so we should not admire them in regard to Satan and the fallen demons.\n\nAnother good organizing strategy for Book 1 is to ponder what things make up the Satanic predicament. For example, Satan (claims a scholar) is “the quintessential loser.” Much of Satan’s predicament can be phrased in psychological terms; for example, he represents the aspiring mind forced to confront its own crushing failure.\n\nThe first thing that we just naturally do as we read Book 1 is to look at Satan and Hell. We are whisked away to a world of the imagination that is highly captivating to our attention. Having looked at Satan and Hell, we then need to look through them to life as we know it. In Book 1, Milton portrays more than a spiritual region known as Hell; he also gives us metaphors of the human condition as we know it day by day.\n\nMilton's Satan: First Acquaintance (lines 27–375)\n\nThe quickness with which Milton moves from his invocation to the plot is breathtaking: he asks two epic questions (lines 27–33) and answers them by identifying Satan as the correct answer, and by that simple maneuver propels us into the action. That action consists of our getting to know Satan as a leading player in the story.\n\nThe key to understanding Milton’s strategy is the framework known as hidden and apparent plots. An apparent plot is the foreground action that we cannot help but see. In Book 1 of Paradise Lost, the apparent plot can be summarized under the formula heroic energy, purpose, and impressiveness. Satan appears to be a grand figure. He is eloquent and talks big. As readers we can easily be misled into thinking that he is a grand and even sympathetic figure.\n\nThe hidden plot in Book 1 can be summarized under the formula heroic evil and futility. This is not a story of grandeur but of Satan’s evil nature and actions and his ultimate defeat. We need to read more closely and at a more interpretive level to decipher this hidden story. But Milton manages the story in such a way that he becomes our ally against any possible misreading of his story. He includes many devices of disclosure—interpretive clues—in his story. These clues are embedded in the text and are easy to find if we orient ourselves in that direction.\n\nChief among the devices of disclosure is the presence of the epic narrator. The narrator is not the same as the storyteller. The storyteller is the source of everything that is in the story. The epic narrator is the presence of the storyteller—a persona—within the text, guiding our responses, making assessments, and calling our attention to certain things. For example, Satan’s first speech (lines 84–124) sounds impressive, but the narrator follows it up with two lines of commentary (125–26) that tell us that Satan is actually in pain and despair. The epic narrator is our travel guide through the poem. We need to accept him as our ally.\n\nThe narrator is not the only device of disclosure by which Milton undermines the apparent grandeur of Satan. If we look closely at the text, we see many evidences of Satan’s heroic evil and the futility of his battle against God. C. S. Lewis speaks of how Satan is always sawing off the branch on which he is sitting. The more formal term in use today is to say that Satan deconstructs the very claims that he himself makes. For example, after using big terms such as mutual league, united thoughts, and glorious enterprise to describe the war in Heaven, Satan admits that he and his followers have ended up in misery and ruin. Again, when Beelzebub replies to Satan’s first, boastful speech, he takes a much more defeatist attitude toward the plight of the fallen angels (lines 128–55).\n\nIt is crucial that we see that Milton first alerts us at length to the hidden plot of demonic evil and the futility of Satan’s attack on God. In lines 33–83, if we take time to highlight every detail that adds to the picture of heroic evil and futility, there is scarcely a line that is not highlighted. The practice among secular readers (known in Milton circles as “the Satanists,” meaning that they admire Milton’s Satan) is to act as though this passage—this introduction to the hidden plot—does not even exist.\n\nThe prevailing style in Book 1 is part of the case that Milton builds against Satan. Milton loads Book 1 with allusions to classical mythology, and also with exalted epic similes that link characters and events in the story to phenomena in history and nature. This is part of building up Satan as a heroic figure in the classical mode. But Milton disapproves of the military hero of classical mythology and epic. Milton’s mythological allusions and epic similes, far from exalting Satan and his followers, are actually part of the disparagement of them that Milton builds into his poem. The mythological allusions and extended epic similes cluster in contexts of evil in Paradise Lost, leading scholars to speak of the demonic or infernal style in Paradise Lost. Nonetheless, we need to unpack the meanings of Milton’s allusions and similes in order to understand his characterization of Satan, and also to relish Milton’s skill in composing them.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThe first half of Book 1 is a balancing act that takes our breath away when we see the skill with which Milton manages it. Milton juxtaposes apparent and hidden plots—Satan’s seeming greatness and his actual evil and ultimate weakness. This is the grand design that we can trace in this part of the poem. What specific details build Satan up in our imaginations and perhaps momentarily sway our emotions? What details undercut that apparent grandeur and produce dramatic irony on an epic scale?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nIt is not necessary to deny everything that secular readers claim about Milton’s Satan; all that is required is that we do not mistake partial truth for the whole truth. At one level, Milton’s Satan is grand; that does not make him good or sympathetic. A literary critic named Stanley Fish claims that Milton uses the technique of the guilty reader. This means that he carefully contrives to get readers to be swayed by Satan and then inserts data into the text that gets them to see that these responses are shoddy and evil. We are “surprised by sin” (a phrase in Paradise Lost and the title of Fish’s book) as we read, confronted with evidence of our own fallen condition. In fact, with these wrong responses we reenact the fall ourselves.\n\nA good organizing strategy that will unify our experience of Book 1 is to complete the formula “images of . . .”—images of defeat, of evil, of pain, of confusion, of irrevocable loss, and so forth. Having completed the list, it will be evident that we do not admire these things in real life, so we should not admire them in regard to Satan and the fallen demons.\n\nAnother good organizing strategy for Book 1 is to ponder what things make up the Satanic predicament. For example, Satan (claims a scholar) is “the quintessential loser.” Much of Satan’s predicament can be phrased in psychological terms; for example, he represents the aspiring mind forced to confront its own crushing failure.\n\nThe first thing that we just naturally do as we read Book 1 is to look at Satan and Hell. We are whisked away to a world of the imagination that is highly captivating to our attention. Having looked at Satan and Hell, we then need to look through them to life as we know it. In Book 1, Milton portrays more than a spiritual region known as Hell; he also gives us metaphors of the human condition as we know it day by day.\n\nMilton’s epic similes are more complex than those of any other poet. They need to be pondered individually, by themselves. This is actually great fun. For example, in lines 196–98 the fallen demons are compared to the Titans and giants of classical mythology who rebelled against Jove (the chief deity) and were punished by being cast into the volcanic region of Italy known in mythology as Tartarus (an obvious parallel to the Christian hell). Just on the basis of this simile, we know five things about the fallen demons: they are huge, they are repulsive (“of monstrous size”), they are rebels against God, they are defeated, and they are being punished.\n\nRoll Call of Demons (lines 376–521)\n\nMilton and his original readers knew both the Bible and classical mythology better than most people today know them. As a result, they relished the excursion into the history of Old Testament idols represented by this passage. Readers today are free to decide how much attention they wish to give to this passage. Even if we are unfamiliar with the specific gods that Milton names, we can read the passage to get a general impression of the repulsive evil represented by the fallen demons.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWhat is the function of the roll call of demons in the overall design of Book 1? What feelings are evoked as we progress through the passage? How does the passage fit into the pattern of apparent vs. hidden plots?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nA very important principle underlies Milton’s portrayal of Satan and the fallen angels (and equally of Dante’s portrayal of Hell in the Inferno), namely, that as human history unfolded, the fallen angels who were cast out of Heaven became the pagan deities and idols of Old Testament history and classical mythology.\n\nSatan's Speech to His Demonic Army (lines 522–669)\n\nWhereas the roll call of demons is one of the flats and shallows in the poem, the description of Satan and his rousing speech to his followers is one of the high points of Paradise Lost. First Milton evokes a picture of the tremendous stature of Satan as a fallen angel (lines 522–621). There can be no doubt that Milton creates an impressive Satan in this passage. Nonetheless, we can credit Satan with being impressive at this early point in the epic without falling into the fallacy of thinking that he is sympathetic or ultimately grand.\n\nAfter the tremendous buildup represented by the description of Satan, Milton presents his speech to Satan’s followers. It, too, is grand and impressive-sounding, filled with boasting and buzz words that might mislead us if we did not subject them to analysis. The effect of the speech is to rouse the demons to a frenzy of defiance hurled against God and Heaven (lines 663–69).\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThe first thing to do is absorb and relish the brilliance of the writing. Then we need to get a grip on our responses. The framework of apparent and hidden plots continues in full force. The apparent grandeur of Satan is countered by other data that uncovers his evil and the ultimate futility of his battle against God. For example, we read that “his form had yet not lost / All her original brightness” (591–92); the word “yet” lets us know that eventually Satan loses all his brightness, and the word “all” implies that he has already lost some of his brightness. The right analytic framework is thus to ask what details contribute to the apparent plot of seeming grandeur and to the hidden plot of Satan’s evil and futility.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe list of reasons why Milton created an initially impressive Satan is long. (1) Evil is the perversion of goodness, so naturally the leader of all evil forces must have possessed qualities that in their original form were great. (2) In the world as we know it, Satan is powerful and alluring [1 John 5:19 claims that “the whole world is in the power of the evil one”]. (3) Milton’s design is to trace the self-destruction of evil, so he first shows Satan at his height and then traces his degeneration. (4) Stories require conflict; as epic hero, God requires an antagonist worthy of him. (5) It is also part of storytelling that a story begins with things in one position and concludes with them in the opposite position. (6) The initially impressive Satan is part of Milton’s technique of the guilty reader.\n\nThe Building of Pandemonium (lines 670–798)\n\nThe apparent plot reaches its climax when the fallen demons concentrate their energy and ability to build the grand city of Hell for whose title Milton invented the word Pandemonium (“all demon assembly”). In keeping with Milton’s design of making Paradise Lost a huge structure of contrasts and opposites, Pandemonium is the antithesis of both the city of Heaven and the garden of Eden. Lest we be misled in regard to the grand appearances of Pandemonium, Milton ends Book 1 with a series of shrinking similes in which the demons are cut down to size in our imaginations: they are compared to bees before a beekeeper, dwarfs, and pygmies, and their grand city is called “their straw-built citadel” (like the house of one of the three little pigs in the children’s fable!). This is a climactic hint that Satan and the fallen demons are not as grand as they superficially seem to be.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nHow does the framework of apparent and hidden plots continue to explain the dynamics at work in this passage? The discrepancy between appearance and reality is known as dramatic irony; how does it operate in this passage?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nIt is essential to our understanding of Milton’s Satan to see that Milton models Satan on the old epic heroes. Milton had to find a place for the “martial theme” (battlefield action) because that was the established subject for an epic. Milton deliberately attached all the usual traits of the warrior hero to Satan because he regarded the whole value structure of ancient epic as wrong. Milton is explicit about this strategy: at lines 553–54 he links the fallen demons with “heroes old/ Arming to battle,” and later he speaks of how the demons appear “in guise / Of warriors old” (lines 564–65).\n\nBook 2\n\nPlot Summary\n\nThe primary action in Book 2, occupying the first half of the book, is the demonic counsel in Hell. The purpose of the counsel, which turns out to be a debate on a grand scale, is to determine what the fallen demons can do to get back at God for having defeated them in the war in Heaven. Four principal speakers attempt to sway the demons. Moloch proposes a military attack on Heaven. Belial suggests that the demons “sit tight,” maintain a low profile, and hope that God will eventually ignore them. Mammon believes that the resources of Hell can be turned into a magnificent dwelling place for eternity.\n\nBut none of those proposals is what Satan wants, so his second-in-command, Beelzebub, proposes what Satan the dictator wants. The new proposal is to send someone to journey from Hell to Paradise and to bring about the fall of Adam and Eve into sin, thereby ruining God’s intention for his creation. This wins the day, and Satan is dispatched to journey from Hell through Chaos to Paradise.\n\nThe second half of Book 2 is not quite as intense as the fireworks of the demonic council, but it nonetheless shows Milton at his most inventive. Epic heroes (and we need to remember that Milton models Satan on the old epic heroes) undertake a perilous journey, and the second half of Book 2 is devoted to Satan’s space journey from Hell to Earth. Satan is the archetypal hero on a quest (a quest to destroy humankind). Epic heroes on a journey always encounter threats and obstacles, and Satan meets these at the gates of Hell. Two personified beings, Sin and Death, initially refuse to allow Satan to pass through the gates, but when it emerges that the three have a family identity, Satan is allowed to pass from Hell into Chaos.\n\nWhile Satan is journeying, the other demons pass the time with demonic forms of entertainment, in keeping with their individual temperaments. Some undertake excursions of discovery into the regions of Hell (thereby allowing Milton to describe hell as a geographic place). Others compete in games or listen to music. Some engage in philosophic discussion. There is no scarcity of action in Milton’s Hell, and this is part of the reason why some have misread the poem as intended to make evil attractive.\n\nAudiobook\n\nBook 2\n\nPublic Domain LibriVox Recording\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThree things claim our primary attention in Book 2. One of these is the continuing characterization of Satan. He remains powerful and eloquent, but his appeal is beginning to erode. Tracing this decline\n\nis a prime task as we assimilate Book 2. Secondly, equal attention flows to Satan’s demonic followers, sometimes represented by individual figures, sometimes by nameless groups. Third, the descriptions of Hell and Chaos as places are a major poetic triumph. Nearly everything that Milton put into Paradise Lost is there because the genre of epic prescribed it as an ingredient. Epics are encyclopedic forms—”the story of all things,” literary critic Northrop Frye has called epic. Part of this “epic sweep” (as critics have called it from time immemorial) is the presence of an entire cosmology or view of the universe. In classical epic the cosmology is somewhat vague and undetailed. Milton’s cosmology is that of Christianity, presupposing a three-tiered universe of Heaven, Earth, and Hell. Additionally, the Renaissance worldview postulated a space between Hell and Earth called “Chaos.” Milton was at his inventive best in portraying his cosmology, and we should take time to relish that inventiveness.\n\nThe Debate in Hell (lines 1–283)\n\nMilton does not miss a beat when he transitions from Book 1 to Book 2. The opening description of Satan on his throne (lines 1–10) is filled with impressive details, but the addition of just four words in an otherwise exalted description is enough to bring the whole grand edifice tumbling down: barbaric, bad, vain, and proud. Charles Williams’s famous quip about the false appearances of Hell is that “Hell is inaccurate.”\n\nThe demonic/infernal style of Paradise Lost becomes highlighted in the demonic council. In Book 1 that style consists of an overabundance of allusions to classical mythology and the presence of extended epic similes. Now high-flown rhetoric takes over. The speeches by Satan and his followers are oratorical masterpieces, in keeping with the premise of fallen humanity that external impressiveness rather than inner spiritual goodness is what matters most. Satan’s manipulation of his followers in order to secure his position of leadership (lines 11–40) is a prime example of this obsession with public status.\n\nThe speeches of Moloch, Belial, and Mammon are rich in human psychology (and C. S. Lewis in A Preface to Paradise Lost has the best discussion). All three show dimensions of the psychology of revenge. Additionally, the speeches are arranged as a hierarchy of evil, with each speaker revealing greater depths of depravity or twistedness. Moloch is the military type and proposes a counterattack on Heaven (lines 43–108). His excited picture of such an attack ends with implied acknowledgment that it is actually impossible. Belial realizes this, so he proposes living contentedly in Hell (lines 109–227), a form of isolationism. Mammon proposes something even more subtle, namely, to “live to ourselves” and turn the resources of Hell into a comfortable residence (lines 228–83).\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nNearly everything in Paradise Lost falls into place when we are aware that most of the time Milton is giving us a highly inventive and expanded version of various epic conventions. For example, Homer’s epic contains councils of the gods—meetings on Mount Olympus where the gods and goddesses determine what will happen in human affairs on earth. This is the motif that governs the debate in Hell in Book 2 of Paradise Lost. Of course Milton’s version of the motif is more magnificent than the relatively brief scenes in Homer’s epics.\n\nThe speeches in the debate are not only oratorical masterpieces but also “classics” of sarcasm and mockery. Despite the pretense of unity in Hell, the debaters at the demonic council reveal an underlying disunity. Each of the speakers ridicules his predecessor. Additionally, it turns out that the whole debate is a charade, inasmuch as Satan has already determined that he wants to get even with God by bringing about the fall of Adam and Eve. C. S. Lewis has an engaging analysis of the human psychology at work in the demonic council. Moloch offers the psychology of rage—the response of the rat caught in the trap. For Belial, the agony of defeat was so terrible that he can think only of repressing his earlier aspirations and accepting a lower level of existence—a form of isolationism. Mammon denies that anything important has been lost and that a substitute will be just as good.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWith this unit we need to remind ourselves that in reading Paradise Lost we are intended to look not only at the places that Milton describes but through them to life as we know it in our own world. Taking our cue that Milton’s council in Hell is filled with realism, we can reflect on the forms in which the psychology of revenge that Milton portrays occur in our own observations and our inner self. For example, the three demonic speakers embody, respectively, the impulses toward physical aggression, toward withdrawal, and toward transforming failure into art and a substitute reality. What other applications occur to you? We can also think of political types in regard to defeat: exertion of military force, retreat into passivity, and denial accompanied by creation of an alternate existence.\n\nThe Enthronement of Satan (lines 281–505)\n\nThe debate in Hell ends on a note of high intensity: Mammon’s suggestion has won universal assent, but it is not what the dictator Satan wants. So his next in command, Beelzebub, produces an even grander and more sarcastic speech than his predecessors and proposes “some easier enterprise,” namely, bringing about the fall of the newly created Adam and Eve in Paradise. This carries the vote, and the question then becomes, “Whom shall we send?” Satan volunteers and utters a boastful and self-congratulatory speech (lines 430–66). In an epic where virtually every detail is part of an overall system of contrasts, the demons bow in “awful reverence” toward Satan, worshiping him “as a god,” just as the council in Heaven in Book 3 will end with the angels bowing in adoration toward the Son when he volunteers to undertake the redemption of humankind.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nIn this episode, too, the real-life parallels and applications are nearly endless. How do the events embody familiar practices of bureaucracy, or dictatorship, or power struggles? But the episode portrays spiritual beings as well as the dynamics of human behavior: what does Milton wish us to understand about Satan and demons?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nSatan’s maneuvering to become undisputed leader of Hell does not embody a noble conception of leadership but rather the strategies of exhibitionist dictatorship. The best refutation of the “Satanist” position (the claim to admire Milton’s Satan) is an appeal to life as we know it: the qualities that some profess to admire in Satan are ones that people despise when they encounter them in people.\n\nDemonic Entertainment (lines 506–628)\n\nMany of the episodes that Milton invented seem perplexing until we place them into the context of the previous epic tradition. For reasons about which we might speculate, ancient epic poets evolved a convention of having their epic characters engage in games and entertainment at certain moments in their stories. Thus when Odysseus stops at a kingdom called Phaiacia on his journey home, his hosts stage elaborate games and entertainment for their guest. Other epic poets introduced epic games into their stories as part of the funerals of famous heroes in the story.\n\nThis is the motif at work halfway through Book 2. With Satan away on his mission, there is no pressing work that needs to be done in Hell. So the demons pass the time with the leisure pursuits that best fit their temperaments and interests. Something else is going on here that was also at work in some of the epic similes in Book 1. Those similes took us throughout the geographic regions of Earth and reached out to numerous human activities. Similarly, in demonic entertainment in Book 2 we take an excursion into life as we, too, know it. The principle at work is this: while seeming to describe life in Hell, Milton is also situating us within our own fallen world. We look not only at the world that Milton imagines but also through it to our own world—a world that is as fallen as the world of Hell.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nIt is always profitable to ask, Why did Milton think that this constitutes good story material? What aspects of Milton’s inventiveness invite our interest and draw us into the action? Additionally, how does the extended picture of demonic leisure activities reinforce or extend our understanding of life in Hell?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nMilton’s portrayal of life in Hell fills out the picture of Hell that was sketched in Book 1. It is important to assimilate his picture of Hell in an awareness that the four great stages of action in Paradise Lost (Hell, Heaven, Paradise, Earth in its fallen state) are both physical and symbolic of spiritual and psychological realities. Thus we need to ponder how life in Hell as Milton portrays it is a state of mind and soul as well as a place.\n\nThe Cosmic Voyage (lines 629–1,565)\n\nA good epic journey involves conflict and obstacles to be overcome. This is exactly what Milton gives us in a long section at the end of Book 2. The first major obstacle to confront Satan on his journey is the resistance that the keepers of the gate of Hell, the personified abstractions Sin and Death, pose for Satan. The episode is partly governed by the literary technique of the grotesque, as Sin and Death are described in loathsome images. In addition to being a perverse family, it is obvious that the three characters are also a parody of the holy Trinity.\n\nBut getting past the gate of Hell is only the beginning of terror for this epic hero on a quest. Milton manages to make Chaos and his realm a terrifying space through which Satan must journey. The sensations are so intense that we actually feel a sense of relief along with Satan when light begins to appear and the tumult of Chaos starts to retreat (lines 1035–55).\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nImagining Hell and Chaos were major problems that Milton as epic poet needed to solve. It is a commonplace that writers imitate reality, but what if that reality is a supernatural realm that we cannot go out and visit? Milton of course made use of the Bible wherever possible (so that, for example, the episode in which Satan encounters Sin and Death is modeled on James 1:15, with its picture of how desire “gives birth to sin, and sin . . . brings forth death”). But an epic poet needs more details than this. Milton naturally uses whatever previous poets had conceived, and one of the most helpful comments on the matter comes from a literary scholar named David Daiches: for literary purposes, “Hell is whatever the human imagination throughout the whole of history has conceived it to be” and most recoiled from.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWe always need to start at the literal, physical level: what pictures, sensations, and feelings are evoked as we accompany Satan through Chaos? Then we need to realize that Paradise Lost is a vast metaphorical universe in which physical images symbolize spiritual and psychological states. The main image patterns in the journey through Chaos are darkness, confusion, anarchy, and storminess. We can therefore ponder how Milton’s invention represents a psychic world and a spiritual world of “principalities and powers.”\n\nBook 3\n\nPlot Summary\n\nBook 3 begins with the second of four epic invocations in Paradise Lost. Milton uses these invocations at major transition points in his story: after two books devoted to Satan and Hell, Milton is ready to transport us to Heaven. So he composed an extravagant prayer to light (lines 1–55).\n\nThe invocation is a grand lead-in to one of the famous episodes of Paradise Lost, known as the “dialogue in Heaven.” This dialogue between Father and Son is a counterpart to the council in Hell in Book 2. The Father begins the dialogue by acknowledging that Adam and Eve will succumb to the temptation of Satan and thereby fall from innocence. With this problem posed, the back-and-forth discussion between Father and Son focuses on how the Godhead should respond to the fall of the human race. The drama climaxes in the offer of the Son to undertake the redemption of fallen humanity. The scene in Heaven ends with angelic praise of God.\n\nThe second half of Book 2 is a complete opposite to this heavenly action. Milton chose to devote the second half of Book 3 (as well as the second half of Book 2) to the ongoing journey of Satan from Hell to Earth. The dynamics at work are those of the cosmic voyage, as a supernatural voyager travels through space and encounters a series of unearthly scenes and agents.\n\nAudiobook\n\nBook 3\n\nPublic Domain LibriVox Recording\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe first two books of Paradise Lost are dominated by Satan. For readers who know only the first two books, Satan is naturally the engaging central character of the story. But storytelling is based on the premise that things begin in one position and end in the opposite position. With Book 3, the counterbalance to Satan and Hell begins. After the suffocating atmosphere of Hell and egomania of Satan, a great sense of relief sets in with Book 3.\n\nIt is as though we can breathe again. Milton described Paradise Lost as a poem “doctrinal and exemplary to a nation,” and C. S. Lewis rightly claims that Milton’s poetry does not exist apart from his theology. While this is true of the entire poem, Book 3 is the most explicitly theological book in Paradise Lost. Milton’s stated intention is to justify the ways of God to men (1. 26), and this requires that he set the record straight regarding his theological convictions. He does this preeminently in the dialogue in Heaven in Book 3.\n\nThe Invocation to Light (1–55)\n\nLiterary scholars have coined the phrase “the Miltonic sublime” to denote a distinctive sublimity in Milton’s style and subject matter. There is no better example of the Miltonic sublime than this invocation. Light in this prayer is physical, mental, and spiritual. After two books set in Hell, which is low and dark, Milton is ready for the first scene set in Heaven, which is high and light. Thus physical light signals a transition point in Milton’s story.\n\nAdditionally, an invocation by an epic poet is essentially a prayer for illumination, so it is natural that Milton should invoke light. Also, Milton was blind, so the need for light to dispel darkness is all the more pressing. But light is more than physical in this invocation: in writing about heavenly realities that transcend the here and now, Milton needs “celestial Light” (God) to “shine inward,” that is, reveal supernatural truth regarding God and Heaven. The invocation ends with one of the most evocative phrases in the entire poem: “things invisible to mortal sight,” a reminder to us that the preponderance of Milton’s story is set in supernatural realms (including unfallen Paradise) remote from physical reality around us.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThis invocation is laden with autobiography (statements by Milton about himself). What do we learn from Milton’s self-portrait that is important to the epic story that he is in the process of composing? Since this passage is the very touchstone of “the Miltonic sublime,” what features of style and subject matter constitute this celebrated sublimity?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe style and content of this passage are sublime and illustrate to perfection the claim of Greek dramatist Aristophanes that “high thoughts must have high language.” The genre to which this prayer to light belongs is the encomium—a poem in praise of either a character type or (as here) a quality. In keeping with this format, Milton praises the qualities of light. But light is more than physical in this encomium: it also symbolizes God, spiritual insight, and intellectual illumination.\n\nThe Dialogue in Heaven (lines 56–417)\n\nThe dialogue in Heaven is an exalted drama of the glory, authority, justice, and mercy of God. It is a drama in the sense that it consists chiefly of a back-and-forth exchange of speeches between Father and Son. In the background is an important Medieval and Renaissance theological tradition known as “the parliament of Heaven”—a debate between the claims of justice and mercy within the God-head regarding the plight of fallen humanity. In the end a way is found to satisfy the voices of both justice and mercy.\n\nWhen in his opening invocation Milton declared his intention to “justify the ways of God to men,” he was identifying his poem as a theodicy (a reconciliation of the goodness and omnipotence of God with the fact of evil and suffering in the world). In the dialogue in Heaven, Milton lays bare the theological premises that make up his theodicy. There are four pillars to Milton’s theodicy, and he derives them from the Bible and Christian tradition. The four ideas out of which Milton builds his dialogue between Father and Son are as follows. (1) Evil will ultimately be defeated (lines 84–86). (2) God created Adam and Eve perfect and endowed them with a power of choice that would enable them to remain in their perfect state (lines 97–99; 116–17). (3) The permissive theory of evil: although God foreknew that humankind would fall, and although he permitted it, he is not the author of evil (lines 117–18). (4) God’s redeeming mercy is available to the human race in its fallen state (lines 130–34; 173).\n\nJust as the demonic council reached its climax in Satan’s offer to undertake the fall of the human race, followed by the demons’ worship of him, the dialogue in Heaven reaches its climax in the Son’s offer to undertake the redemption of the human race, followed by the angels’ worship of him. Claims that Milton fails to make Heaven appealing are untrue; the angelic hymns that conclude the dialogue in Heaven sound the authentic note of heavenly joy.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThe dialogue in Heaven is a succinct summary of the best that Christian thinking has produced on the subject of theodicy; we need to ponder the ideas presented here, recall biblical passages that assert these same ideas, and reflect on how they apply to our own lives. Second, just as Milton’s images of Hell in Books 1–2 are intended to impress upon us certain truths about Hell, the portrayal of life in Heaven in Book 3 is Milton’s attempt to convince us of certain truths about Heaven; what are those truths? What does Milton want us to believe about God and Heaven?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nTheologians supply us with the ideas and doctrines of the Christian faith; Christian storytellers and poets give us images of the Christian faith. We need both. Milton’s strategy is to make us dwell imaginatively with the great images of our faith as we proceed through Paradise Lost. First we live with images of Satan, demonic evil, and Hell. In Book 3 we contemplate images of God and Heaven. As we keep reading we encounter images of Paradise, of war in Heaven, of creation, of the fall, of sin in human history, and of redemption.\n\nIt is a commonplace understanding that Milton created a celestial style as a grand contrast to his demonic/infernal style. The latter consists of a smothering excess of mythological allusions, exalted epic similes, and embellished rhetoric. The heavenly style that we meet in the dialogue in Heaven is characterized by an absence of those things. It is a simpler style, made all the more accessible to Christian readers by the presence of numerous biblical allusions, and embellished only by pleasing patterns of repetition (an effect that registers with us especially when we hear it read aloud).\n\nSatan's Journey toward Paradise (lines 418–742)\n\nLike the last third of Book 2, the second half of Book 3 narrates the details of Satan’s perilous voyage from Hell to Paradise. Obviously Milton thought that this was good story material, so we should throw ourselves with zest into the adventure of traveling with Satan through the cosmos. Certainly this extended journey confirms a critic’s comment that as we progress through Paradise Lost we are never allowed to lose our sense of vast space. In an era when space travel in both fiction and real life is prominent, we are in a good position to enjoy Satan’s space trip.\n\nSeveral literary genres converge to add narrative interest to the account. One is the horror story: as the journey unfolds, there is much to terrify Satan and us. Some of the terrors are creatures, and others are the sudden views that greet us, like an airplane flying through stormy weather or a carnival ride that suddenly plunges us downward. Of course Satan’s perilous journey is an adventure story. Yet another genre is the travel story in a fantasy mode, with strange sights greeting us at every turn. For cinematic effects, it is hard to beat Satan’s journey through realms unknown to us.\n\nBut along with all the narrative excitement we need to be alert to the ways in which the physical always embodies the spiritual in Paradise Lost. The characterization of Satan remains constant in the midst of the constantly shifting physical sensations, and he is increasingly sinister as a figure of evil. In particular, he emerges in this episode as an arch-deceiver. The quest on which Satan is bent is not a pleasure trip but a journey to effect the fall of the human race and the entire creation, so the further Satan travels, the more unsettled we feel.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWhat narrative elements claim your attention and interest? What spiritual meanings are embodied in these story qualities? How is the characterization of Satan reinforced and advanced?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nStories consist of a back-and-forth rhythm, and additionally story-tellers operate on the principle of giving us heightened contrasts. At the beginning of Book 3 we swing from one pole of Milton’s imagined cosmos (Hell) to the opposite pole (Heaven). Once the dialogue in Heaven is finished and the angelic songs of praise are concluded, we swing back to the realm of satanic evil and cosmic darkness. The orderliness of Heaven is now juxtaposed to the disorder of the realms through which Satan passes.\n\nMilton’s decision to devote nearly half of Books 2 and 3 to the journey of Satan will seem more plausible if we consider the overall story. Paradise is Milton’s ultimate image of human perfection. We know that such innocence is remote from life in a fallen world. Just as writers of utopian fiction make us travel long distances to arrive at the “good place,” Milton distances Paradise from our starting point in the story. Its physical remoteness signals the remoteness of its perfection from life in our world.\n\nBook 4\n\nPlot Summary\n\nBook 4 is the best book in Paradise Lost. The main focus is life in Paradise, as Milton gives us the greatest version of the archetypal earthly paradise in all of world literature. Milton springs a surprise on us by starting Book 4 not with Adam and Eve in a perfect garden but with Satan uttering a famous soliloquy. With Satan thus introduced into the scene, we approach Paradise gradually along with Satan.\n\nOnce Satan climaxes his physical journey by leaping over the protective wall of Paradise, Milton reveals more and more about the perfection of the happy garden. First we get a physical description of the garden. Then Adam and Eve are introduced, eating supper at the end of a working day. The nature of their relationship and their life in the garden gradually emerges as we overhear them converse in stately epic style. Then they retire for the night with an evening prayer addressed to God, followed by sexual union.\n\nMilton does not allow us to conclude the book with this paradisal note. Just as he began the book with Satan, he ends it with Satan. As Eve sleeps, Satan prepares to instill a dream temptation into her imagination. The angel Gabriel discharges angelic sentries through Paradise, and they come upon Satan. A full-scale verbal altercation ensues, and the defiant speeches that Satan and Gabriel exchange in the epic mode results in an epic single combat, though in a verbal mode rather than by means of physical combat. When God produces golden scales to weigh the outcome of the conflict, Satan sees that he is defeated, so he escapes from the garden (to return later).\n\nAudiobook\n\nBook 4\n\nPublic Domain LibriVox Recording\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nIt is an epic convention to have what critics call “a pastoral interlude”—a retreat from the hero’s main exploit of military combat or conducting a perilous journey, in a beautiful and relaxed setting. But Milton makes Paradise more than just a brief respite from the main action. In Paradise Lost, Paradise (and not the battlefield) is where the central action of the epic occurs.\n\nAn epic sums up what a whole culture wishes to say. It embodies the ideals that the author and his audience hold most dear. Milton is a Christian poet writing for a Christian audience. The domestic life of husband and wife in a perfect garden enables Milton to embody in narrative form the values that he esteems most highly. By demoting the martial (military) theme of traditional epic and replacing it with pastoral and domestic values, Milton completely revolutionized the epic tradition.\n\nSatan's Soliloquy (lines 1–130)\n\nBook 4 marks another shift in setting, and it is useful to recall that until the fall in Book 9, there are three main scenes of action in Paradise Lost—Hell, Heaven, and Paradise. These are both geographic places and spiritual/mental states. Although Milton does not give us a full-fledged invocation to mark the transition to Paradise, he comes very close to it in stating a wish for the prophetic voice that the book of Revelation records (lines 1–5).\n\nThe action then begins with one of Milton’s most daring moves in the whole poem. Although Book 4, which we might title “Life in Paradise,” is the “feel good” book in Milton’s epic, Milton delays our arrival in Paradise and devotes a major unit to the development of Satan’s character. First the narrator tells us that Satan is filled with despair, and then Satan confirms it in a famous soliloquy. Before we note the content of Satan’s soliloquy, we need to understand the ground rules of the soliloquy as a dramatic genre. A soliloquy is an over-heard speech uttered by a character in solitude. Further, Shakespeare had already set the standard for making a character speak the truth when uttering a soliloquy, since there is no plausible reason for the character to be deceitful when no one else is present.\n\nUp to this point, Satan has always been keeping up appearances before his demonic followers. This is the first time in the poem that he has spoken he truth as he knows it. In this soliloquy Satan completely reverses the picture that he has presented to himself, to his followers, and to us, though the epic narrator has kept us informed all along that Satan is not as he appears. In this soliloquy Satan admits that he is in despair, that he seduced his followers in the revolt against God, that his fall was his own choice, and that he now regrets that choice. More generally, Satan accuses himself and exonerates God. For once the apparent plot (the foreground action, which here consists of Satan speaking truthfully) agrees with the hidden plot (a story of evil and futility).\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThe ramifications of this passage for the characterization of Satan in Paradise Lost are numerous; what are they? We can then broaden the scope and theorize about Milton’s overall intention with Satan as a character in Paradise Lost. For example, it is obvious that Milton envisioned the characterization of Satan as dynamic and always changing. What are the changes? What are the underlying principles in Milton’s developing portrait of the figure of greatest evil?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nAs a political figure, Milton’s Satan is a case study in ambition and tyranny. In lines 89–90 Satan reveals that he has fallen into the trap of leadership: he wanted power at all costs and now regrets his choice, even though he now is powerless to relinquish leadership because it would shame him.\n\nThe Approach to Paradise (lines 131–204)\n\nThe best commentary on this passage is by C. S. Lewis. Paradise is a universal human longing for a place that no longer exists in our physical world. It is distanced from us, as signaled partly by the long journey that Milton makes us take to finally arrive there. With this as his task, theorizes Lewis, Milton’s challenge in portraying Paradise “is mainly won in advance”: if he can create an overpowering sense of anticipation as we gradually approach the place, as readers “we shall be already conquered.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Milton was operating on such a premise. Starting with line 131, we keep moving (with Satan) closer and closer to Paradise. Then at a certain point the motif of gradual approach takes the form of our being at the bottom of the mountain on which Paradise is situated, with our gaze going up, up, up until we finally catch sight of the perfect garden. “At last,” writes Lewis, “almost beyond belief, we see for once with mortal eyes the trees of Paradise itself.”\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nIt is important to Milton’s portrayal of Paradise that we as readers experience it through Satan’s eyes and consciousness. We travel to Paradise with Satan. Satan’s first glimpses of the garden are ours as well. From time to time as Milton describes the garden and tells the story of life in it, the epic narrator will remind us that we are looking at the scene through Satan’s consciousness ( e.g., “Beneath him . . . now he views . . .”—line 205). The logic of this strategy is sound: any view of Paradise that we have is from our own fallen perspective.\n\nMilton's Vision of Paradise (lines 205–87)\n\nNow that we have arrived in Paradise, Milton turns to the task of describing the garden. The most important thing to understand about Milton’s paradisal vision is that he is giving us one of the great archetypes of the human imagination. Everywhere we turn in life and literature, we find the human race picturing the good life and good place as a lush garden. The appeal is universal to the present day. C. S. Lewis correctly claimed that Paradise is a region of the imagination that does exist and should be visited often. This means that Milton’s vision of Paradise is designed to awaken something inside us.\n\nMilton’s descriptive technique fits this design perfectly. Milton gives just enough details to activate our own imagined version of the things that he names, but not so many details as to impede our own memories and pictures. For example, we read that when God planted Paradise (the garden of or in the broader region named Eden) he “caused to grow / All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste” (lines 215–16). Exactly what were these trees? Our own experiences of trees and fruit (and perhaps especially our memories of them from childhood) provide the answer to that question.\n\nMilton’s Paradise is thus universal and archetypal, but it is also unique, in accordance with its place in Paradise Lost as a whole. This is not just any paradisal place; it is the original Paradise of God. We can therefore view it as a visionary realm, remote from anything that currently exists in our fallen world. It is an image of longing—longing for the irretrievably lost. Additionally, Milton managed the description of Paradise in such a way as to show that it is also a geographic place and a way of life and spiritual condition. Finally, Milton’s Paradise differs from what we usually find in literature by having the capability of being lost. It has a potential for change (whereas the earthly paradises in a writer like Homer are permanent and static).\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThe framework of generalizations just stated provides avenues for analysis. We can begin with our own responses: what longings are awakened in us as we read Milton’s description? What details of the description are universal or archetypal? What are the most paradisal places you have experienced? What details in Milton’s description convince us of its physical reality, and what details show it to be more than earthly? Simply at the level of imagery (and not yet considering Adam and Eve’s life in Paradise), what details evoke our awareness that this garden is precarious in the sense of having the potential to be lost? As a literary archetype, Paradise belongs to the broader archetype known as the “good place motif”; what things make Milton’s garden a fitting member of the good place archetype?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nVirtually every detail in Milton’s Paradise is rooted in a tradition that lies behind it. A literary critic named Arnold Stein (in his book Answerable Style: Essays on Paradise Lost) has a good summary of the layers of tradition that lie behind Milton’s Paradise. He writes that “back of the image is . . . Eden as historical fact.” There was also a pagan tradition of the Golden Age. Pastoral literature, which portrays country living and rural settings, is one of the central conventions of literature throughout its history, and Milton’s Paradise is pastoral as well as belonging to the more mythic archetype of the earthly paradise. Finally, there is the universal human longing for peace, fulfillment, and simplicity (especially the simplicity of childhood).\n\nMilton’s Paradise, writes Milton scholar J. B. Broadbent, is “a master image of equilibrium” (balance between opposing qualities); “the overall feeling we have is stability on the brink of change.” As an example of balanced qualities, Milton gives his garden a tremendous sense of physical reality; yet Paradise is “more than earthly and out of time and place” (Broadbent).\n\nAdam and Eve (lines 288–324)\n\nHaving described Paradise as a place, Milton moves toward an account of life in Paradise. He first introduces Adam and Eve. The opening description lists the qualities that Adam and Even mutually share (lines 288–95) and then differentiates Adam and Eve by ascribing distinctive excellences to each (lines 296–311). A description of Adam and Eve’s nakedness telescopes into an assertion of the goodness of married sexual love (lines 312–20). To climax the passage, Milton unloads a brief catalog of stately epithets that elevate the unfallen couple in our imagination (lines 321–24).\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWe first need to begin by making sure that we have read Milton correctly: what traits does he attribute to Adam and Eve together and individually? What does he regard as universally human traits, and what as gender-based? What details elevate Adam and Eve above ordinary humans?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nAdam and Eve are not an ordinary human couple. Milton is primarily interested\n\nin what they share as the original prototypes of the human race and gives them only a few gender-based differences. T. S. Eliot comments that “they have ordinary humanity to the right degree, and yet are not, and should not be, ordinary mortals. Were they more particularized, they would be false.”\n\nWhen Milton says that Adam and Eve are not “equal” (line 296), he is using the word equal in the Renaissance sense of “not identical.” The statement that Adam was made “for God only” and Eve “for God in him” is a comment about the order of creation (first God created Adam by himself and then Eve was created to complete Adam), as well as a statement of Puritan conviction of the primacy of the spiritual (Eve supremely values what is Godlike in her husband). Virtually everything that Milton says about the marriage relationship has a basis in the Bible.\n\nLife in Paradise (lines 325–775)\n\nEpic is by its very nature a picture of what the author and culture producing it regard as the good life and a repository of the highest values to which people can aspire. As Milton thought about portraying life in Paradise, he asked himself what he regarded as normative for people—what God intends for the human race. Stated another way, Milton’s portrayal of Adam and Eve’s perfect existence is offered as a picture of not only how God intended the first couple to live but also how he intends all people to live, anytime, anywhere.\n\nWe can organize Milton’s story of life in Paradise around key scenes and episodes by which Milton chose to picture how he thought God intends people to live. The context within which these episodes or scenes unfold is Adam and Eve’s eating supper after a day of work (lines 325–40), part of the domestic emphasis of Paradise Lost. Here are the key passages: Adam’s first speech in the poem in which he extols God’s wonderful provision for him and Eve (lines 411–39); Eve’s recollection of her first encounter with Adam and his winning her love on that occasion (lines 441–504—the romantic love motif of a couple’s first meeting); Satan’s soliloquy in which he expresses his torment at seeing Adam and Eve’s love for each other (lines 502–35); Adam’s suggestion that he and Eve need to retire early so they can rise early to perform their work the next day—a succinct summary of Puritan convictions about work (lines 610–33); Eve’s love song addressed to Adam (lines 634–59); Adam and Eve’s evening hymn of thanks to God (lines 720–35); Adam and Eve’s sexual union before falling asleep (lines 736–75).\n\nAn important principle at work here is that an epic poem is designed to give the reader images or examples of heroic virtue. We might note in passing that Milton himself never calls Paradise Lost an epic; it is always “a heroic poem” in his terminology. This, in turn, relates to the question of who the hero in Paradise Lost is. On the human plane, Adam and Eve are the heroes of the poem. Half of their heroism is displayed in their virtuous life in Book 4 of Paradise Lost. The second half of their heroism will be displayed after the fall in their mutual forgiveness of each other and their repentance from sin and coming to trust in Christ as savior.\n\nWith the ground rules of the hero story guiding our responses, we should read Book 4 as giving us models of virtue to emulate. The whole vision of the good life in Book 4 is a Puritan vision, embodying the same ideals that we can find in abundance in Puritan sermons and treatises. Obedience to God’s commands is the overarching principle (Adam’s first speech). The elevation of married love and sexual union within it was nothing less than a Puritan obsession (Adam and Eve’s first meeting, Eve’s love song, the narrator’s exaltation of sexual love in his speech beginning with the apostrophe “hail wedded love”). Equally Puritan is the dignity of daily work and embracing it as something that gives purpose to life (Adam’s explanation of why the couple needs to get to bed on time). To view all of life as opening up to God and the spiritual realm is part of the Puritan genius for seeing God in the commonplace (Adam and Eve’s evening hymn).\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nAll of the events discussed above are “purple passages” that will reveal splendors if we subject the passages to close reading and explication. The commentary above (including the marginal notes) can provide a blueprint for analysis of the respective passages. Some overriding impressionistic questions can balance that close reading: What do you like best and/or least about life in Paradise as Milton portrays it? What surprises you about Milton’s portrayal?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nMilton had ideas about the ideally masculine and the ideally feminine, but he was not obsessed with gender the way some people today are. Doubtless he would phrase some things differently if he were writing today, but the point is that he was not writing today. Milton’s view on masculine and feminine was not controversial in his day.\n\nModern feminism falls into two camps—those who want to claim for women qualities and roles that have traditionally belonged to men more than women, and those who want to elevate feminine qualities as being applicable to men also. Milton fits comfortably into the second category. He disparages military strength and the urge toward power and elevates domestic values, the nurturing tasks of tending a garden, and such virtues as gentleness and love.\n\nThe episode of Eve’s admiring her own reflection in the water (lines 449–92) does not show that Eve is vain and self-absorbed. Instead Milton invented the episode in order to embody convictions about marriage: it is based on consent, it completes husband and wife (Adam claims Eve as his “other half”), and its success depends on the harmonious acceptance of the husband’s headship in the marriage.\n\nAdam’s remarks about the dignity of human work (lines 610–33) embody cherished Puritan ideals about work: God appointed it, it “declares [human] dignity,” and it is an arena within which God holds people accountable.\n\nEve’s love poem (lines 639–50) is a nature poem as well as a love poem. It praises the beloved as the source of the speaker’s joy, a conventional motif in love poetry. This praise is conducted by means of a contrast: first Eve lists what she finds delightful when Adam is present to share it (“with thee” lines 639–49), and then she lists the same things again, asserting that they are indifferent when Adam is not present to share them (“without thee” lines 650–56). The Miltonic genius for giving us the exalted subject matter in the high style is at its very best in this passage.\n\nSatan's Attempt to Make Eve Sin (lines 776–1,015)\n\nIt is part of storytelling to organize events in a story on the principle of swinging back and forth between opposing or balancing phenomena. We start Book 4 with Satan’s malice as he journeys toward Earth to destroy the innocence of God’s creation. Then we luxuriate in an extended picture of the happy garden and human life within it. As we end Book 4, we swing back to Satan and his evil intention. In this nightmare passage, Satan squats like a toad by the ear of the sleeping Eve, preparing to tamper with Eve’s imagination and will in the form of a dream. Angelic guards interrupt his scheme.\n\nAlthough we will not encounter a full-fledged epic battle until the war in Heaven in Books 5 and 6, we get a good warm-up in this episode. The angels and Satan exchange scornful challenges and put-downs of each other. Nothing is more pervasive in Paradise Lost than the enterprise of Christianizing the motifs of classical epic. In this passage at the end of Book 4, Milton composed speeches of defiance that express not only personal hostility between the angelic guards and Satan but also theological truths. Similarly, in classical epic the gods occasionally bring out a set of supernatural scales to weigh the outcome of an earthly battle. God does not need help in determining the outcome of the conflict between Satan and Gabriel. Accordingly, the scales here at the end of Book 4 are used to reveal God’s power over Satan and thereby prevent a threatened battle.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWhat draws you into the episode and maintains your interest? In addition to relishing the exchange of scorn, you can profitably ponder the theological truth that the speeches sometimes embody.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nMilton is not often credited with being a master of satire and scorn, but in fact he is quite good at these things. Taking his cue from Psalm 2, with its picture of evil rulers raging and God sitting in the heavens and laughing in scorn, Milton amplifies the altercation between Satan and the angelic guards into a self-respecting exchange of insults in the manner of epic battle rituals.\n\nDiscord in Paradise? In Paradise Lost, the garden of (in) Eden was prefect but not invulnerable. Right from the beginning of recorded history in Genesis 2–3, the premise was that this garden could be lost through disobedience. In fact, everyone knows that this garden was lost. Throughout the middle books of his epic, Milton conducts an extravagant balancing act between the perfection of Paradise and our awareness that it has been lost.\n\nBook 5\n\nPlot Summary\n\nWhereas Satan had immediately vanished from the garden when he saw the cosmic scales predict his defeat if he persisted in his conflict with the angelic guards, we as readers are given a more gradual exit from the garden. The opening episodes of Book 5 still focus on the perfect couple in the perfect garden. After Adam’s exalted wake-up call to his new bride (lines 1–25), Eve recounts the dream temptation that Satan had instilled into her imagination while she slept (lines 28–93). Adam interprets the dream in such a way as to calm Eve’s disquiet (lines 95–135). To complete the counterbalance to Satan’s dream temptation of Eve, Adam and Eve utter an exalted morning hymn of praise (lines 136–210), thereby drawing a boundary around our experience of life in Paradise.\n\nThen the scene abruptly shifts to Heaven, where God looks down with pity at the vulnerable innocence of Adam and Eve. He summons the angel Raphael and gives him the instructive mission to visit Adam and Eve and warn them of Satan’s evil intention toward them (lines 220–45). It is common in classical epics for the gods to dispatch one of their own to carry a message to mortals on Earth. As always, Milton outdoes his predecessors. The briefly narrated descent to Earth in classical epic here becomes a captivating cosmic journey (lines 246–97). Furthermore, Raphael’s visit and discourse with Adam and Eve takes up four whole books of the epic! Two main topics are discussed during Raphael’s visit—the war in Heaven (Books 5 and 6) and God’s creation of the world (Books 7 and 8).\n\nThe brief Old Testament story of Abraham and Sarah’s entertaining angelic visitors (Gen. 18:1–8) is transmuted by Milton into a full-scale epic event when Adam and Eve enact the rituals of hospitality toward their angelic visitor Raphael (lines 298–450). Adam’s question about what life is like in Heaven (lines 451–67) enables Raphael to ease into his instructive mission. First he voices a general explanation of the great chain of being and the need to obey God’s intended order (lines 468– 543). But the main purpose of Raphael’s visit is to give Adam and Eve an account of Satan’s behavior during the war in Heaven. The second half of Book 5 narrates what happened on the first day of a three-day celestial battle.\n\nAudiobook\n\nBook 5\n\nPublic Domain LibriVox Recording\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nDespite the length of Paradise Lost and the wealth of details that Milton packed into it, Milton constructed his epic in such a way that we can easily keep the big picture in view. With a little streamlining, we can see that the poem unfolds on a principle of pairs of books. Books 1 and 2 were devoted to Satan and Hell, and Books 3 and 4 to Heaven and Paradise. Now we are ready for two books devoted largely to the war in Heaven.\n\nIn the opening invocation, Milton alerted us that he would slant his story of the fall of the human race around the idea that God is not to blame for what Adam and Eve brought upon the world. Raphael’s visit is an important part of that design, as hinted in the narrator’s statement that God “fulfilled all justice” when he dispatched Raphael. The logic of this assertion is that Raphael’s story of the war in Heaven will give Adam and Eve a full understanding of how Satan operates and of his evil intention to bring about the fall of Adam and Eve.\n\nEve's Dream Temptation (lines 1–135)\n\nIt is a rule of storytelling that major developments in the plot must be anticipated and therefore seem plausible to readers. In telling the story of the transition from absolute perfection to total sinfulness, Milton needed to provide a narrative transition for readers. He did this by inventing episodes in which Adam and Eve increasingly reveal their vulnerability. This is not to say that they are portrayed as progressively falling. They remain innocent until the eating of the apple in Book 9. But we as readers can later look back at several episodes in which we see the ingredients, good in their unfallen state, that were perverted by Satan in the temptation that caused the fall.\n\nEve’s dream temptation is the first of these anticipations of the fall. The dream temptation was instilled in Eve’s imagination while she slept (Book 4, lines 799–813). The episode does not show an inclination on the part of Eve to eat the apple but the contrary: Eve abhors the dream (lines 34–35, 92–93). This episode is not a psychological transition in which Eve shows weakness but rather part of a narrative transition for the benefit of us as readers. In the dream temptation we can see in kernel form all the ingredients that will appear in full-fledged form in the actual temptation in Book 9: Eve’s being deceived as to who is speaking (line 37), the tempter’s appeal to Eve’s delight in the sensory qualities of the garden (lines 38–43), the tempter’s flattery of Eve (lines 43–47), his making the forbidden fruit provocative (lines 50–66), and the “divinity motif” in which Satan attempts to intoxicate Eve with a desire to be a goddess (lines 67–92).\n\nBut even though these are the same ingredients that appear in the eventual temptation that results in the fall, here they leave no taint because they were visited upon Eve during her sleep. Eve’s reason had no opportunity to judge the truth or falseness of images presented by Satan to her imagination. This is the gist of Adam’s reassuring explanation of how the dream is innocent of spiritual taint (lines 94–128).\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWhat features of the passage, including Adam’s exalted wake-up call of Eve and her equally rapturous reply (lines 1–30), show that Adam and Eve retain their innocence? Balancing that continuing innocence, what details show that Adam and Eve’s innocence is precarious in the sense that it can be lost?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nThe episode of Eve’s dream temptation does not show Eve in a process of falling. Underlying the entire episode is ancient dream theory, which Adam fully expounds in his interpretation of Eve’s dream (lines 95–128). According to that theory, it is the function of the reason to judge the truth or falseness of images presented to it by the imagination (or “fancy” in Renaissance terminology). During sleep, the reason is inactive, so no images presented could be properly judged. Eve’s dream has been a providential forewarning to her, leaving her more capable, not less capable, of withstanding a temptation from Satan by daytime. The dream shows what can happen, not what must happen.\n\nAdam and Eve's Morning Hymn (lines 136–223)\n\nMilton’s portrayal of life in Paradise is the high point of his epic. It is the part of the story in which Milton embodies the values and virtues that he wished to elevate in his poem that he designed to be “doctrinal and exemplary” for his readers. Adam and Eve’s morning hymn provides an exalted conclusion to Milton’s picture of the perfect human existence.\n\nAs Adam and Eve move outdoors into the morning scene (lines 136–52), we should be reminded that Paradise Lost is a great nature poem as well as a great love story. The morning hymn that this perfect couple utters is a psalm of praise, based directly on Psalm 148 (one of five nature poems in the book of Psalms). The governing motif is a series of apostrophes and doxologies (commands to praise God) addressed to various creatures of nature.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nWhat passages in Books 4 and 5 make Paradise Lost a great nature poem? What specific ideas and attitudes toward nature make up Milton’s view of nature? How do Milton’s multifaceted pictures of the beauty and pleasure of life in Paradise fit into his larger design of justifying the ways of God to people?\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nOne of the delights of Milton’s narrative poem is the embedded lyric poems, such as Eve’s love poem in Book 4. Adam and Eve’s morning hymn is equally great. Its most obvious poetic qualities are the ceaseless motion and energy of nature, rapture over that energy, and the sense of God’s presence in all of nature. We can profitably compare Milton’s hymn to Psalm 148 to see what Milton carried over and what he invented.\n\nRaphael's Arrival in Paradise (lines 219–560)\n\nThe motivation for Raphael’s journey from Heaven to Paradise is stated at the very outset of this episode: God wishes to give Adam and Eve every possible chance to withstand Satan’s temptation, so he arranges a visit by Raphael that will inform them of Satan’s wiles. The wealth of narrative detail regarding the journey and arrival might perplex us until we understand the epic conventions at work.\n\nOne of these conventions is known as “the descent from heaven”—the journey of a messenger from the gods to the human agents in the epic. As always, Milton makes the cosmos through which his supernatural agents travel thoroughly tangible (one of the superior qualities of Paradise Lost). Second, the entertainment of the guests with ideal hospitality is a hallmark of classical epic. The rituals of hospitality and feasting were important to ancient cultures and the epic tradition. Milton’s genius is to adapt the rituals of arrival, welcome, feasting, and discourse to the rural (pastoral) world of his epic.\n\nBut along with this reenactment of familiar epic conventions in a pastoral mode, something revolutionary is also at work. In classical epics an interlude of leisure in a relaxed setting stands in contrast to the epic hero’s military exploits, which are regarded as the serious aspect of the hero’s life. Here the pastoral world embodies the values that Milton substitutes for the heroic world of battlefield conquest. Milton replaced heroic (military) values with domestic and pastoral values, and Adam and Eve’s acts of hospitality embody those values.\n\nAn important part of the descent from heaven is the conversation that occurs between hosts and guest after a meal has been shared. Milton’s version of this convention is Raphael’s discourse about the great chain of being (lines 468–543). In keeping with his story material of “man’s first disobedience,” Milton makes Raphael stress the element of obedience that is required for the chain of being to remain stable. In turn, Adam asks questions about the need for obedience, and before we know it Raphael has begun his account of the war in Heaven.\n\nFor Reflection or Discussion\n\nThere is so much poetry and so much doctrine in Paradise Lost that "
