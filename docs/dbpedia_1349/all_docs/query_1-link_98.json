        "text": "A soundtrack of a game is like an ingredient to a soup; it can be the most minimal of parts that adds to its delectability, or it could be at the forefront, bringing forth a deluge of strong flavors. In video games, these musical compositions can spring a whole virtual world into life and build a fitting atmosphere for any locale or key moment. Along with the likes of game mechanics and story, I believe that music is one of the most significant aspects of any game.\n\nMusic expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent. - Victor Hugo\n\nVideo game music have a remarkable impact upon me personally, and I am inspired by the great minds behind my favorite soundtracks to someday write my own works. In the meantime, I'll write about my favorite soundtracks instead!\n\nKid Icarus: Uprising\n\nAn all-star team of composers - comprising of Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi, and Yasunori Mitsuda - had their hand in making this wondrous soundtrack. Even so, they not only captured the tone of the original game, but the remastered and new tunes compliment each other perfectly.\n\n♪\n\nIt's also interesting to note that a majority of these songs go along with the events that take place during the game, which I feel makes the whole soundtrack incredibly memorable. I can only imagine the characters' banter and action going on in my mind as I listen to these tracks.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams is one of my all-time favorite composers, and I love his work on the series and beyond video games. Despite all the flak it gets, I loved the second installment of Metal Gear Solid, and the soundtrack is one of the reasons that I place it up so highly. Never have I wanted to rise and give a salute more than the main theme of this game. More than that, it captured the raw emotions of the characters at pivotal moments or the intensely charging atmosphere of a grueling duel.\n\nFire Emblem\n\nOf course, I'm talking about the series because I'd be hard-pressed to not include some of my favorites! The musical work of these games nail at accentuating the atmosphere of the situation at hand, whether they be jubilant highs or somber lows. It was grieving to fight my fellow teams on the other side of the battlefield, or the amount of regret that overwhelms me as I plow my way across a battalion of soldiers who've lost their will to fight against us, all while these beautiful pieces of music are playing.\n\nBetween fighting a tough foe or a romp on weaker soldiers, there's always a theme that makes these skirmishes well-worth the battle in the series.\n\nHope y'all enjoyed this! I leave off with a couple more songs from these various soundtracks! Until next time!\n\nOkay, this shouldn't be that surprising that I went with this topic. Nope. Nope. NOPE!\n\nFor the weekly community blog, I decided to create a twist of a compilation that I initially wanted to work with, which involves the topic of the various classes in Fire Emblem. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they also serve a niche in the midst of battle! I'm also going to highlight some of my favorite characters of these classes as well! I hope you will enjoy reading this!\n\nNow for some honorable mentions:\n\nLight Mages & Monks - They are basically the glass-cannon class of the series that can tank against other magic users, due to their high resistance, and can dish out some serious damage themselves. However, they have terrible physical stats, and they can usually become one-hit K.O'd by powerful foes with high strength. Their promotion makes them a better support character with their new-found access to staves. Most noteworthy characters: Lucius, Linde, and Micaiah\n\nShape-shifters - Whether they be Laguz, Manaketes, or Taguel, these humanoids have the ability to transform into the creature they share physical characteristics with. Their transformations give them huge stat boosts, but they are either limited as to how many times they can change or how long they can retain their powerful forms; the Laguz also suffer from slower experience gains compared to their kindred from other titles. Most noteworthy characters: Tiki, Ranulf, Panne, and Myrrh\n\nKnights & Generals - Stalwart units that usually carry the highest defensive caps of all the classes, and they're most likely than most to survive an enemy offensive. They are the truest definition of a tank! Most noteworthy characters: Horace, Gatrie, and Oswin. I don't think I'm forgetting someone here...\n\nNow for the top 10!\n\nDisclaimer: I did not make any of these fantastic works! Credits go to their respective artists!\n\n10. Wyvern Riders and Lords\n\nCharacter: Batman Gerome\n\nWyvern riders have some of the best mobility of all units, next to Pegasus Riders, due to being able to fly across all terrain and obstacles. Unlike their fellow aerial counterpart, these guys and gals are pretty durable and can last an onslaught of attacks. On the other hand, they share similar weaknesses of wind and arrows (except in Radiant Dawn), and they aren't as speedy or magic tolerant as the Pegasus Riders. Depending on the title, they'll start out with either an axe or lance but will gain one of the other two upon promotion.\n\nMost notable characters: Heath, Jill, Minerva, and Cormag.\n\n9. Tactician and Grandmaster\n\nCharacters: Robin(s) and Morgan(s)\n\nA class type found only in Awakening, the tactician wields the unique combination of tomes and swords, which allows them to adapt to both close and long-ranged combat. While players can choose what asset and weakness their character will have, Tacticians generally have the most balanced stats, and their access to both strength and magic ensures they'll dish out massive damage with their signature skill, Ignis!\n\n8. Axe Fighters and Warriors\n\nCharacter: Hector\n\nGuys with this class will usually boast the highest strength stat of all the other units. Their raw power and deadly axe can smash through just about any formidable defense, and their great HP and decent defensive capabilities will provide them some durability. Unfortunately, they are plagued with sub-par speed and atrocious resistance growths, but they can also easily overwhelm their magical adversaries with a single attack.\n\nMost notable characters: Boyd, Nolan, Ross, and the Vaike!\n\n7. Calvary and Paladins\n\nCharacter: Seth\n\nAs one of the most prolific classes of the series, these characters can roam across large fields with relative ease, and like most mounted-units, they can quickly rescue units in dire need of assistance; with well-rounded stat growths, there's no immediate worry of them becoming trounced by incoming enemy forces. Their only weakness are the special weapons that are specifically designed to take them out!\n\nMost notable characters: Sigurd, Titania, Geoffrey, Sain, and Stahl.\n\n6. Mages and Sages\n\nCharacter: Soren\n\nCharacters that fall under this class will boast the highest magical potency, with having access to all three elements of Anima magic. These units will absolutely destroy anyone with low resistance, and they also have advantages towards units with a specific elemental weaknesses, such as airborne units with wind damage and beast Laguz with fire damage. Unfortunately, like most magic users, they aren't well-equipped for a physical confrontation and can easily be overcome by powerful enemies.\n\nMost notable characters: Ewan, Miriel, Merric, Emmeryn and Bastian.\n\n5. Lords and Great Lords\n\nCharacter: Lucina\n\nLords tend to be the main protagonist of the game, so they'll have various buffs to keep them relevant throughout the plot-line. For the most part, their weapon of choice is a sword unless they fall under a different class archetype or given a secondary weapon. Nonetheless, they are almost guaranteed to be a reliable unit for their mainstay!\n\nMost notable characters: Chrom, Marth, and Eliwood.\n\n4. Assassins\n\nCharacter: Volke\n\nThieves really don't become awesome until they reach their promotion, which is the Assassin class! Unsurprisingly, they carry the ability, Lethality, that allows them to eliminate their foes with a single fatal strike. While they aren't very durable units themselves, their lithe constitution also makes it difficult for opponents to land a hit on them. Strangely, it's only in Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn where they can use daggers; everywhere else is just swords!\n\nMost notable characters: Jaffar and Gaius\n\n3. Myrmidons and Sword Masters\n\nCharacters: Say'ri and Yen'fay\n\nIn stark contrast to Knights, Myrmidons have the highest speed stats of all class archetypes, which makes them even harder to inflict damage on them than most units. They don't have the offensive ability to completely wipe out an opponent, but they can easily make numerous strikes that will seriously wear them down! As the header suggests, these units are true masters of the sword and their only weapon of choice!\n\nMost notable characters: Lyn, Mia, Edward, and Joshua.\n\n2. Soldiers and Halberdiers\n\nCharacter: Ephraim\n\nSoldiers are a rare breed of playable units that are available in a limited amount of titles. However, even though they are more versed in their physical capabilities, their resistances are greater than most non-magical units, making them one of the most balanced of classes. Playable or not, they only use lances as their professional weapon.\n\nMost notable characters: Nephenee and Aran\n\n1. Mercenaries and Heroes\n\nCharacter: Ike (in both Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn)\n\nMercenaries fit in this wonderful balance between the Myrmidons and Axe Fighters, giving them great speed and strength growths. They can not only unleash some serious damage with every attack, but their agility allows them to assault their opponents incessantly. While they don't have impressive magical stats either, their promotion to the hero class allows them access to throw-able axes, which gives them both short and long-ranged offensive abilities. Combining these assets with substantial HP and defense growths, the Hero class is truly a force to be reckoned with!\n\nMost notable characters: Raven, Gerik, and Ogma.\n\nWhat I'd like people to do this week, is write about their favorite video game weapons!\n\nThere's a myriad of weapons out there in the world, and it's definitely no exception in video games that we are beheld to various types of 'em! In fact, a plethora of these armaments range between incredibly bizarre to wonderfully unique in our favorite medium, but we can always recognize some of the tried and true utensils of warfare, like swords and firearms.\n\nFor the weekly blog, instead of highlighting just one type of weapon, I decided to divide some of my favorites into specific categories because there is plenty to choose from to only pick a single one!\n\nBOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!\n\nBe it throwing a grenade right on the opponent's lap or using my RPG against my DNUT buddies, I always LOVE to use explosive weapons whenever I have the opportunity to do so. My favorite custom matches always involve using these truly destructive items of deadly force. Every loud, thundering crash I hear as a result of a successful hit is music to my ears; the fiery, billowing ball of smoke that comes afterwards is a visual reminder of my accomplishing strike! I even laugh my butt off whenever I'm subjected to a comedic, explosive death!\n\nMight want to keep the volume low for this video:\n\nThat sound effect is just glorious!\n\nThey might have personalities in some Mario games, but I've mostly considered these walking bombs weapons when they're out for your blood! Anyways, whether it be Smashing or Karting, Bomb-Ombs are items that I've definitely gotten the most use out of due to their repeated appearances. Heck, there's a dedicated mode in Mario Kart: Double Dash for solely using these ticking time-bombs, which is an absolute blast! And yes, pun intended!\n\nIt's always satisfying to nail someone with a well-timed toss of a Bomb-Omb while racing; even more hilarious is that you kinda become one if you ever lose your balloons in 64's battle mode. Sudden deaths in Smash Bros. makes Bomb-Ombs true angels of death as they rain from above. Initially tense, things can go South once these buggers start spawning onto the battlefield in droves!\n\nHonorable mention: Smart Bomb (Star Fox)\n\nA Clash of Blades\n\nNow time for seriousness! Swords are some of the most common weapons around, and it's not surprising as to why; they've been around for centuries, even millenniums! However, they come in various assortments of shapes and sizes that it'll be much to go through every type. In games, there are unique swords that are given a special attribute and lore that makes them stand out among the rest. Not surprising, my favorite types of characters tend to be mostly sword users, or I'll make my character revolve around using these sharp blades.\n\nWhat is my favorite sword, you say? Well, this shouldn't be surprising, like at all.\n\nWielder of the Blue Flames\n\nThis is Ike's signature sword, Ragnell; it wasn't always his, though. In Tellian lore, it is one of two blessed swords that the famed beorc warrior and first Apostle of Begnion, Altina, used in a grueling battle against a dark god. About 800 years later, it fell away from the country's possession, and Ike received this holy sword under intense circumstances and uses it late in the game (tryin' to avoid spoilers here. ).\n\nRegardless of game, Ragnell is an incredibly powerful heavy-sword, and it requires incredible strength to wield it. Combined with its length, it gives Ike some serious range with just a single swipe in Smash Bros. Thanks to its magical properties, its reach is even greater with its ability to unleash bursts of energy, which removes Ike's weakness of not being able to counter against long-ranged opponents.\n\nJust ignore Priam's method of using its 'range' IT'S NOT A JAVELIN TO SIMPLY BE THROWN, DUDE!\n\nI am aware of Ragnell losing its blessing in Awakening, but still... bleh!\n\nHonorable Mention: Monado (Xenoblade Chronicles)\n\nThe Unconventional\n\nThere are some uses of even everyday items that are so far out there, and they definitely can be considered weapons. Mario trounces his enemies by simply jumping on them with his sturdy shoes, Neku calls forth psyche from his collections of pins, and the whole concept of Okami involves summoning a paint brush to evoke Amaterasu's wide array of moves.\n\nSo what beats all of these guys? How about a toy?\n\nWhile he uses it mostly for concentration, Genis' primary weapon of choice is a kendama, a Japanese toy with various playing styles. It may not seem to be even remotely special or powerful, but for any monster or foe defeated by him using this item, it is truly the ultimate shaming device. YOU DIED BECAUSE OF A FREAKIN' TOY?!?! FOR SHAME!\n\nGenis is not amused.\n\nHonorable mention: Fan (Super Smash Bros.)\n\nI hope you've enjoyed reading this! Until next time!\n\nCouldn't really concentrate in writing this yesterday in light of Robin's passing. Here it is though:\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about the Fire Emblem series is being able to consistently create a diverse cast of characters for each entry. There's always something that differentiates them from other characters of their own games and from even other entries, and it makes getting to know these characters an interesting and enjoyable experience. With this blog series, I hope to highlight some of my favorite characters of the franchise.\n\nWarning! Spoilers Ahead!\n\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23\n\n24\n\nName: Tibarn\n\nOrigin: Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance; Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn\n\nOther interesting quirks:\n\n+ King of the Hawk Laguz nation, Phoenicis\n\n+ Reyson's loyal friend\n\n+ Guardian of the remaining Serenes royal family\n\nWith the aftermath of the Serenes Massacre, Tibarn took in the distraught Herons and vowed to do his utmost for his fellow Bird laguz. As a result, the Hawk King became merciless and spiteful towards the Beorc, but he exhibited greater animosity towards Begnion citizens, in which he would pillage from their merchant ships in retribution of the genocide. He also expressed distaste when the Raven King, Naesala, began making exchanges with the humans, feeling that he's become insensitive of the Herons' loss. While he may seem dishonorable, he is an incredibly proud and respectable warrior who won't tolerate any wrong-doings lest anyone would want to invoke his wrath.\n\nDespite his hatred for humans, Tibarn stopped Reyson from wiping out the invaders in Serenes with his Galdr, knowing that he'd lose an invaluable friend over his burning lust for vengeance. However, the conflict between the Greil Mercenaries and Duke Tanas' forces piqued his interest, and he quickly rushed to aid the former when he noticed another Heron survivor under their protection. Upon further investigation, he became impressed with Ike and learned to trust him with his subordinates and Reyson, who wanted to accompany them for saving his sister, Leanne. In the midst of the Mad King's War, he also lost a cherished friend, so he became fully committed to ending Ashnard's reign of terror across Tellius with the Crimean Liberation Army.\n\nEven though his abhorrence for the Beorc alleviated in the previous war, the King of the Skies found himself in conflict against Begnion again, having been enlightened of the senators' involvement in instigating the Serenes Massacre. Tibarn was the primary advocate in declaring war against the Begnion Empire, and he wanted them to answer for their heinous crimes. Consequently, he assembled the other laguz nations to form the Laguz Alliance, and together they clashed against Begnion's might.\n\nOnce stability returned to Tellius, the bird Laguz tribes were unified under one country, and Tibarn was made its first king of the new nation.\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about the Fire Emblem series is being able to consistently create a diverse cast of characters for each entry. There's always something that differentiates them from other characters of their own games and from even other entries, and it makes getting to know these characters an interesting and enjoyable experience. With this blog series, I hope to highlight some of my favorite characters of the franchise.\n\nSpoilers ahead!\n\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23\n\n24 | 25\n\nName: Inigo\n\nOrigin: Fire Emblem: Awakening\n\nOther Interesting quirks:\n\n+ His Birthday is on August 7th, the same day Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon released in Japan.\n\n+ He makes a Princess Bride reference in the localized versions.\n\n+ Most likely to be awake at night among the Shepherds.\n\nInigo is well-known for his happy-go-lucky nature and incessant philandering; however, he wasn't always as such during his childhood. Like his mother, Olivia, he was timid and even more introverted, too shy to even keep a steady conversation with anyone. Eventually, Olivia advised him to talk to girls in order to overcome his shyness, and while he did, this was where he also adopted his womanizing ways. He always seems to fail or get rejected by the recipients of his 'affections', but he becomes upset or even depressed when nothing goes his way.\n\nInigo aspired to become a dancer like his mother, and there was a special technique that the two would practice together before her demise. After her death, he would dance near her grave despite only knowing half of the technique; he would imagine the praise and criticisms that she would've given, and he developed his own version for the other half of the dance. With Grima's resurgence imminent, he joined up the new generation of the Shepherds, lead by Lucina.\n\nEven with his world's blighted time of darkness and despair, Inigo always carried himself with a smile even as he held his own internal struggles, not wanting to show an ounce of weakness. While he does bear good intentions with this attitude, sometimes others won't take him seriously or dismisses him as uncaring as a result, which upsets him greatly. He still held onto his seemingly carefree nature as he and his comrades leapt back into the past, a time where all of their parents are still alive and Grima hasn't been resurrected.\n\nFor the many years he stayed in the current era, Inigo searched tirelessly for Olivia, searching for dancers across both continents. Their reunion was met with flustered awkwardness on both ends, but seeing the clear resemblances between them made it bittersweet for him and his mother. Inigo tried to perfect their special dance on his own, but she eventually found out of his secret outings and even began teaching him the final steps.\n\nAfter the wars end, Inigo travels across the world, doing his utmost to bring a smile to everyone he meets with either his service or performances.\n\nWe're all gamers here, and IGN is one of many venues to discuss about our favorite games! Even when we agree to disagree, it is always our passion for gaming that brings us here, whether it be for a franchise or a particular genre.\n\nAs part of the community initiative, I'll be sharing my favorite types of games, play-style, and platforms of choice.\n\nGaming Preferences\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have much of a preference when it comes to multiplayer, or really any play-style. Be it online or local, I love having the chance to play with friends around me and abroad, but online has taken more precedence for me since I don't know very many people that enjoy gaming here nowadays. I don't require every game to have this feature though; do I prefer it? Heck yeah!\n\nBesides the connectivity, I've also come to enjoy the social aspects of co-op gaming. It's always rewarding for both me and my friends whenever we achieve a goal or objective with teamwork. Ask any DNUT our rule of a high-five in Uncharted 3! Not that I don't enjoy a competitive match; it's in my nature to become consumed with adrenaline in a tight match, palms drenched with sweat as a single action could be my last. I generally hate blowouts, no matter which side I'm on, and I always strive to condition my skills in my favorite games.\n\nOf course, I always have time to sit-down and enjoy a single-player game on my own. Be it experiencing the world or story within or doing some mindless fun, sometimes I just want to do things on my own.\n\nHaving grown-up in a primarily console environment, it is really not surprising that my primary preferences lie in this area in gaming, though that is not to say that I have no interest in PC or handheld gaming. There's plenty of games that I've spent hundreds of hours on those platforms, and it's great to game while multitasking on the comp. or on the go! However, thanks to the breadth of smaller games on PC and the 3DS's ever expanding library of fantastic games, these platforms got plenty of love in the last year or so, and I am strongly considering saving up on a gaming rig someday.\n\nAs for my console preferences, I've stuck with a Nintendo and Playstation combination for most of my gaming life. Like I've mentioned earlier, these consoles are what I grew up with, especially Nintendo's offerings; thus, I've developed quite the affinity for these two platforms, which offers a plethora of various titles and genres that suit my tastes. Plus, I've already build quite a library on the digital front.\n\nWhy no Xbox, you say? For the most part, its exclusives doesn't really appeal to me, not even Halo, and the meager that do isn't really worth investing into a third console platform in my eyes. However, I can honestly say that Microsoft is winning me over with their next-generation system, but it still falls behind in interest compared to the Wii U and Vita.\n\nSo what is my favorite platform of choice? Well, this one's easy:\n\nFor me, there hasn't been a platform that has beaten the wide array of amazing titles found on the GameCube. Really, the only downer for me was that Mario's adventure in Isle Delfino wasn't up to snuff to his first 3D game, and I thought it was a good game in of itself. Everything else, on the other hand, was exceptional.\n\nIf I could ever make a list of all-time favorite games, it's only on this platform where I could find a perfect quintet of amazing games; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Tales of Symphonia, Metroid Prime, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Super Smash Bros. Melee are some of, if not, the best that the GameCube and their respective franchises have to offer.\n\nAdditionally, this system offered more bouts of wonderful multiplayer action than I've ever had. Asides from all the Smashing, there was those grand clashes of ground and aerial battle in Star Fox: Assault or comical co-op moments in Mario Kart: Double Dash, and I could always play some of the last great Mario Party games if I ever wanted to wreck friendships!\n\nThese titles only scratch the surface of all the wondrous games I've experienced on the 'cube, and it shaped me into the person I am today; they were the spark I needed to become a full-fledged gamer.\n\nI could list 'em all, BUT THAT'D BE TOO MANY!!!\n\nFavorite Genres\n\nIn no particular order...\n\nJRPGs\n\nNotable Mentions: Persona 3 FES, Tales of Symphonia, Chrono Trigger, and The World Ends with You\n\nCharacters and Story, these are the main focus of the genre, and the combination of both developments make these games a joy to experience. Being able to connect with the characters and resonate with all the highs and lows are what make these games so great. For the most part, gameplay varies between decently enjoyable to wonderfully addicting, but it's really the narrative that keeps me engaged with these games.\n\nPlatforming\n\nNotable Mentions: Super Mario Galaxy, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Banjo-Kazooie, and LittleBigPlanet 2\n\nPlatformers are one of the more classic genres that almost anyone can play, either in 2D or 3D. The gameplay tends to be really simple, but it doesn't mean that the game are easy themselves! These games are often my quick escape from boredom because I can just pick up where I left off and stop when I've had my fun. I sometimes spoil the games for myself due to my obsession of having to collect every danged item.\n\nAction/Adventure\n\nNotable Mentions: Metroid Prime, Minecraft, Saints Row the Third, & Metal Gear Solid III\n\nSometimes, I just want to explore the world around me, and these games do exactly that, mostly. And with everything that the world offers, there's always a reason to check every nook and cranny that I can reach. These games are much more liberating with what I can do, and I can take on any battle with whatever approach I want.\n\nStrategy\n\nNotable Mentions: Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, Valkyria Chronicles, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor, & Pokémon Conquest\n\nHow about games that punish you greatly for even the slightest mistake? This trait is the hallmark of many a strategy game! It's even more rewarding when you've successfully gotten out of a bind with every character in perfect condition. Remember, considerable preparation and teamwork is the key to winning these types of battles!\n\nFighting\n\nNotable Mentions: Super Smash Bros. Melee, Soul Calibur II, and Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale\n\nThere are times where I just want to beat the crap out of something, and fighting games allow me to vent my frustrations! You could also say that this genre brought out my incredibly competitive nature, which I'm always trying to become better at. This is probably one of my lesser favorites, but I'll always enjoy playing or watching a tense match!\n\nWell I hope you enjoyed reading this! Until next time!\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about the Fire Emblem series is being able to consistently create a diverse cast of characters for each entry. There's always something that differentiates them from other characters of their own games and from even other entries, and it makes getting to know these characters an interesting and enjoyable experience. With this blog series, I hope to highlight some of my favorite characters of the franchise.\n\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23\n\n24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28\n\nWarning! Major spoilers ahead!\n\nName: Micaiah, also known as the Silver-Haired Maiden\n\nOrigin: Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn\n\nOther interesting quirks:\n\n+ She is one of the Branded\n\n+ One of only two main protagonists to use primarily magic\n\n+ Has a Dark Affinity despite being a light magic wielder, ironically\n\nBefore the Mad King's War, Micaiah lived a modest lifestyle as a fortune-teller in the streets of Nevassa, Daein's capitol. Despite the common populace's animosity against the Branded, she loved her country and sought to do whatever it takes to make it a welcome place for all, though she also feared that same backlash would be directed towards her. One day, she came across a young boy intently watching her, and she eventually approached him, in which she also learned of his name: Sothe.\n\nAfter their fateful meeting, they journeyed across Tellius together, but as Sothe grew older, Micaiah believed that she couldn't stay with the Beorc boy for much longer due to her inherited traits of slow aging. Not wanting to subject her beloved friend to these potential repercussions, she left him in Crimea, but she immediately regretted doing so when the war commenced. Their bittersweet reunion in Daein, once the war ended, was rife with emotions, and they vowed to never leave each others' side.\n\nWith Daein's defeat at the hands of the Crimean Liberation Army, the fallen nation was left under the jurisdiction of the Begnion Empire, and the occupation army has left the once-feared nation in terrible condition for three years, the people oppressed by their ruthless overlords. While he currently has no ties to the country's state of affairs, Micaiah blamed the general of the Crimean Army, Ike, for Daein's woes that she became resentful and bitter towards him.\n\nSeeing her beloved country in such a deplorable state, Micaiah and fellow Daein citizens assembled to form the Dawn Brigade in order to free Daein from tyranny, and their exploits are soon to be the cause of numerous revolts across the ravaged nation, which resulted in gaining further support from the lost Prince of Daein, Pelleas. The Silver-Haired Maiden spearheaded the rebellion, and her dreams of restoring the nation back to its former grandeur was within her grasp once she drove away the occupation army. Micaiah accepted her new role as commander of the Daein army as reconstruction ensued; the nation could finally get a breath of relief...\n\nHowever, this pause of peace was short-lived when King Pelleas ordered the Daein forces to join the new conflict on Begnion's side, even if they did have no reason to fight. Nonetheless, Micaiah still took on her new position in faithful stride to protect Daein's interests and, eventually, citizenry. Even with these meaningless, hopeless campaigns against the Laguz Alliance and the Apostle's Army, she remained steadfast in these fights to allow her country to live another day, going against titans like the Greil Mercenaries, and she would go as far as to commit, what is considered, heinous acts of warfare for perseverance.\n\nNOTE THAT THIS SUPPORT BLOG WILL CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS FOR FIRE EMBLEM AWAKENING!\n\n~\n\nIF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THEM AND WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS THEN KINDLY LEAVE THIS PAGE!\n\n~\n\nVIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED!\n\nNow with that disclaimer out of the waaaay...\n\nSuper Mario 64 is perhaps one of my favorite 3D platformers of all time, but the nostalgic memories that I have for the game hardly compares to all of the array of emotions I've experienced in Fire Emblem: Awakening. Besides, there are much better platformers that accomplishes more than what 64 does, 'revolutionary accomplishments' aside. Fire Emblem Awakening is a fantastic entry that boasts a whimsical, colorful cast of characters with some great additions and twists to the strategic gameplay, and the title is incredibly vibrant with personality as a result.\n\nIf there is another thing that Awakening does wonderfully, it is having the music perfectly accentuate the themes and mood of the game. The beautiful, genius work of Rei Kondoh, Hiroki Morishita, and Yuka Tsujiyoko makes the soundtrack such a sublime experience the minute these songs entered my ears. Every tune just felt right whenever I found myself hanging out with the Shepherds or assisting them with my tactical expertise to prevent an apocalyptic hell-scape from becoming a reality. Even the endgame and credits themes were a love-letter to dedicated fans of Fire Emblem, almost like Intelligent Systems were making their final farewell to the franchise...\n\nBut none shook me to my very core than this song and the ensuing moments:\n\n\"Emmeryn would not have wished for this to come to bloodshed.\"\n\n\"Don't speak her name!\"\n\n“Your rage is justified, Prince Chrom. But the meaning of your sister's final sacrifice was not lost on me. I suspect many Plegians who heard her final words would say the same. If you lay down your weapons, I vow to protect you as best I can. ”\n\nI knew, as I made the usual preparations, that what I was about to experience was heart-wrenching, but nothing could've prepared me for the pleas of the demoralized Plegian army, the unbridled fury of the Shepherds, and the anguish of the exalted family, with this song playing in the background. A whirlpool of emotions began to grip me once I progressed further into the chapter, between absolute pity for the Plegians' lack of will to continue fighting and grief for my brothers-in-arms. I had wanted to hold onto our unstable prince before he was gripped unspeakable anger, and I desired nothing more than to hunt down the man responsible for all of our woes: the Mad King Gangrel.\n\nWhat I witnessed from the beginning was a slaughter, with the Shepherds unleashing their ire on the awaiting Plegian army. Even if the enemy had lost their resolve, they had no choice but to face the might of the Shepherds head-on, with their deaths inevitable whether they chose to fight or flee. The puddles, as a result of the unrelenting, weeping storm clouds, soon mixed with the blood of fallen soldiers. Combined with this song, I had begun to tear up for this somber, despairing battle.\n\nAnd sitting at the edge of the Midmire was an honorable man, Mustafa, who was deserving of his rank with his morality. Even if his merciful offer was rebuked by Chrom, he was understanding of the prince's feelings of anger. What he wasn't deserving of was his demise at the hands of the Shepherds due to his unwavering devotion, not for his cruel king but for the protection of his family. If I could, I would've asked him to join us in our trek to dethrone the Mad King, but there was nary an option to do so.\n\nLike what a soldier had mentioned earlier, there was no consolidation in hunting down these men; they finally realized the vision that Emmeryn wanted for the people of Plegia and Ylisse, but it was the expense of not only the life of the deceased Exalt but the lives of these innocent soldiers that want nothing to do with the conflict any longer.\n\n“Well done, Ylisseans... Hrrggh! Please...spare my men...”\n\nMoments like these are why I love Fire Emblem Awakening and why it has become one of my favorite games of all-time. Chapter 10, Lucina's judgment, the Endgame, and the Future Past sections brought out raw, powerful emotions that I've hardly ever experienced in video games.\n\nI was double-tagged, so here I am with yet another community post!\n\nWhile we're reaching the final stretches of 2014 (time sure flies by!), there's still plenty of games that I am hotly anticipating this final quarter of the year. Of course, with the year coming into a close, the line-up for the upcoming quarter looks spectacular already, and there are just as much titles to look forward to when they finally arrive! Some of these are pretty obvious, but hey I can't stop saying how much I'm looking forward to these!\n\nRules:\n\n\"You can only list one of your most anticipated games from 2014 and another from 2015 with reasons as to why you desire that game and at least have to be announced\"\n\n\"The next category is where you can choose a game from any timeframe whether it be a game with an unknown release date where the developers are scratching their heads for an appropriate release date... or perhaps some Gold or something. It can even be another game from 2014 or 2015.\"\n\n\"The fourth game is different because it's doesn't have anything to do with the future. Instead it involves the most anticipated game you might have been waiting for in the past such as 2010 or perhaps earlier.\"\n\nAnd here we go!\n\nMost Anticipated: 2014\n\nOh boy, I've been waiting for this game since the day it was first announced back in 2011, and I really won't shut-up about it until the game's in my hands! What can I say? I absolutely adore the franchise! The 3DS version is out in about a week, which will sate my hunger for a new Smash while I wait for the elusive Wii U version.\n\nEven though I currently have the demo, it doesn't really help quell my anticipation when most of my favorite characters and desired newcomers are simply staring back at me, almost mockingly so. I can't wait to try out all of my main guys and gals with the revamped engine and start playing online again with friends and other fellow Smashers! Y'all best prepare yourselves!\n\nIT'S SO DANGED CLOSE, I CAN ALMOST TASTE IT!!!\n\nLook for another blog talking about Smash Bros. next week!\n\nMost Anticipated: 2015\n\nGAH! My heart always melts upon seeing that ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE YOSHI! I seriously cannot get over how everything in Yoshi's Woolly World looks so danged CUTE, yet incredibly vibrant. *ahem* Every time I see this game, it always manages to bring these jubilant feelings to the surface; it's almost contagious! Good Feel sure are living up to their namesake, for me anyways!\n\nMost Anticipated: Bonus Game\n\nMy favorite Pokémon game getting a remake? YES PLEASE! Hoenn has always been a beautiful region, but now it looks as gorgeous as it has ever been! I've been eagerly awaiting a remake, and it definitely looks like Game Freak are going above and beyond with this game. It just looks so danged fantastic!\n\nMost Anticipated to Date\n\nWHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS GAME ISN'T OUT YET?\n\nI'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR IT TO COME OUT ALREADY!\n\nTHESE TRAILERS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!!!\n\nTHE HYPE IS SO DANGED REAL!\n\nI DON'T EVEN LIKE MOST FINAL FANTASY GAMES, BUT THIS ONE LOOKS SO DANGED LOVELY!\n\nGAH!\n\nHope y'all enjoyed reading this! What are your most anticipated games? Until next time!\n\nTAGGED:\n\nfirethorn43\n\nSAM31007\n\nfantaffx\n\nMissyMee283\n\nExelement\n\nI may have written small passages about my adoration of Wind Waker, but I don't think I've really delved into as to why that is the case; as this year's My IGN tourney champion, I feel it is the ripe opportunity to do so! This will become about the second time ever that I would've talked about the Legend of Zelda on this site, so here I go!\n\nAs for our destination... The wind will guide us!\n\nI've said previously that this game wasn't my first entry into the series and was ready to quit as a result of not being able to enjoy the games, believing that it probably wasn't for me; Wind Waker was the first to introduce the magic, the kind that evokes feelings of fantastical wonder and excitement of yore. Where I'd want to explore every inch of the world, which, in this case, is the deep blue that is known as the Great Sea.\n\nYou could say that Wind Waker's strongest attribute would be its presentation, and I concur! The vibrant, beautiful art style makes the title stand out as a timeless classic, and every ounce of the world has a stroke of lovely colors that lends to its ageless appearance. Each setting and environment pours with clear colors, and they all look beautiful thanks to the cell-shading prevalent in Wind Waker's visual style. Amusingly, I loved seeing the smoke effect from an explosion!\n\nThis unique art style also allows for each and every character to poise themselves with numerous, unique expressions, and what other character does this better than Link? He perfectly articulates his thoughts visibly without muttering a single word, with his visage giving us dialog in our minds. Link's incarnation in Wind Waker is easily one of the most expressive characters in the series, only rivaled by his ancestor in Skyward Sword!\n\nWEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\n\nI can't leave off the presentation without talking about the game's soundtrack! Even at the start of the game, I was introduced to the wonderful Celtic overtones that makes up Wind Waker's music. When I finally set sail to traverse the Great Sea, an adventurous tune slowly rose in volume, which soon became the defining theme of this majestic expedition; I truly felt like I was on my own odyssey while this song was playing. Conversely, the seas became terrifying to travel when Ganondorf unleashed his curse upon all, and the track ominously reflected the state of affairs. These songs do an incredible part of highlighting these emotional, tense moments, and my favorite still happens to be with Link's departure from Outset. Additionally, the soundtracks made fighting the bosses something I always look forward to for every replay\n\n~\n\nNo matter what island I've landed on, there was always something to do or unlock in later parts of the game. Even with Link's humble beginnings at Outset, I did everything I could quickly before I went to meet his grandma. Once my trek in the seas was finally underway, I always made sure that I filled out my map whenever I could, even if it seemed pretty pointless at first. Sometimes in my random visits of these islands, I'd come across things I shouldn't have, like the ominous Ghost Ship or Cyclos in his tormenting fury; they serve as a ever-present reminder of the dangers I'd encounter throughout Link's journey. Of course, I also recognize that, despite the haunting threats, there's always the inhabitants of the sea that share our thirst for adventure, like the treasure hunters. The seagulls pass nearby as constant companions in Link's trek to save the seas, and they're some of the best allies of the series!\n\nSome of my fondest moments of the game actually involved the Tingle Tuner; in the GameCube version, one could connect a GBA with an adapter and treated with dual-screen action, which in my situation was co-op with my brother. While this add-on had its own side quest, what really did was a ridiculous amounts of shenanigans, abusing all of the power-ups to succeed in certain mini-games and messing with the residents of Windfall and Dragon Roost Island. Indeed, these led to a bunch of comical accidents or woes, especially once I realized I had lost so much money for the map translations. This was my first co-op experience with my brother, and it's moments like these that I still nostalgically recall to this day.\n\n~\n\nLink's journey to save his sister and all of the Great Sea is one I consider the best in the series with all that it does, and it's one of my all-time favorite games; for me, Wind Waker stands along the likes of my other cherished games, such as Fire Emblem Awakening, Metal Gear Solid 3, and Banjo Kazooie. This game allowed me to give the series another chance and made me a fan of the Zelda games. Best of all, what I've experienced in the vast oceans is truly unlike any other game I've played, and one I hope to play again with its latest remaster! I feel it is wholly deserving of being the first Zelda to win the 2014 My IGN tournament!\n\nIn accordance to my previous postings, I've decided to make one last blog now that we're hours away from release!\n\n~\n\nThis is it, western Smash fans! The excruciating wait is almost over, the day which we'll finally get our hands on the latest Smash Bros. games! Since its announcement back in 2011, I've been anticipating this game with incredible zeal, and in less than a day, we'll be able to Smash to our hearts' content together!\n\nBe it the newcomers or veterans of the franchise, there is something we're all excited to experience in the games! All the new characters look wonderful and all, but there has to be something else we're also looking forward to!\n\nWhat are you looking forward to most with Smash Bros?\n\nMake your roster here and post 'em!\n\nIt's hard to not say that I'm most looking forward to trying out the roster, and can we really deny that when Smash Bros is mostly about fighting with your favorite Nintendo All-Stars? For Smash, it's almost a given! However, it doesn't make trying out the newcomers or returning with our veterans any less exciting, especially now with custom moves in the foray! Even though I've adjusted to Smash Bros' new physics thanks to the demo, I am truly looking forward to seeing how this transition affected my past favorite characters.\n\nWhat makes this particular installment so interesting is all the various newcomers are perhaps the most unique of the previous batches, and each of them have their own quirks that makes them stand out. As for some illustrations, Shulk's various Monado arts makes fighting him against his buffs unpredictable, Robin forgoes the typical swordsman representative for Fire Emblem with a bevy of magic tomes at his/her disposal, and Little Mac's focus on ground-based battles isn't like anyone we've seen before! Even with the characters that I'm indifferent towards, I can see how their translation from their respective games to Smash is wonderfully seamless, and it makes them worth checking out at least once!\n\nAsides from the characters, the next big feature I'm anxious to try out is online. Remember how atrocious the lag was in online Brawl? While the mode did serve its purpose, there was room left to be desired for smooth online, though it had its moments thanks to a couple of buddies! My experiences with past 3DS games online hasn't kept my hopes up, but I hope maybe Smash Bros. 4 will change that! Unless Nintendo is doomed to repeat their mistakes and overload their servers... again...\n\nSmash Bros. has always been a major part of my life socially, having played with my relatives and friends since the N64! In fact, I wouldn't have found the My IGN community if it wasn't for my desire to express my love for the series! Even with the cruddy online in Brawl, I always had a blast playing with fellow users here, and once Nintendo shut-down the servers, it only fueled my insatiable hunger to play online again. I can't wait to play with everyone again!\n\n~\n\nI was going to outline some plans to host a couple of special tournaments of my own, but with all the current ones coming out soon, I've decided to post-pone releasing details for now. Once things begin to settle down, I'll make another post that will highlight these unique rules, though I want to play around with the game modes before I announce anything. Look forward to them later on in the month! For now, here's a taste of the themed tourneys and events I'll start with:\n\nFists/Swords of Smash!\n\nSuper Bash Sisters\n\nHeavyweight Brawl!\n\nI will also host and promote other My IGN events involving Smash Bros with positive contributions. With our help, I hope that we can make the My IGN Smash community even more active than ever before on the site! That way, even when the Wii U version comes out, we'll be ready to hop on-board quickly with our efforts! Starting with the 3DS Friend Code Hub!\n\nWelp, this would've been longer, but I've been sidetracked by many a distraction. Still, I hope y'all enjoyed this, and Smash on my friends!\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about the Fire Emblem series is being able to consistently create a diverse cast of characters for each entry. There's always something that differentiates them from other characters of their own games and from even other entries, and it makes getting to know these characters an interesting and enjoyable experience. With this blog series, I hope to highlight some of my favorite characters of the franchise.\n\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23\n\n24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31\n\nNote: Major Spoilers Ahead!\n\nName: Naesala\n\nOrigin: Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance; Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn\n\nOther interesting quirks:\n\n+ Serves as the anti-hero in both games.\n\n+ He was briefly mentioned in Fire Emblem: Awakening\n\n+ Always carries a coin upon being recruited\n\nWhile he may be known as the notorious, cunning King of Kilvas, Naesala will do his utmost to preserve his nation's welfare and citizens. The Raven King inherited the curse of Begnion's Blood Pact once he assumed his new position, and this was only after the previous successors were killed off as a result of the last king disobeying the contract. He is often seen collaborating with the Senators of Begnion, and so he gained the distrust of his Laguz allies, particularly Tibarn and Reyson.\n\nThroughout the Mad King's War, Naesala was the instigator of many a conflict for the Greil Mercenaries, often sending out his cohorts to attack them and pillage from the unsuspecting. In one of his deals with Begnion, he betrayed Reyson, who was considered his closest friend, and sold him to Duke Oliver of Tanas. From these events, this sent both the Mercenaries and the renegade Begnion force into a race to find the Heron Royal after he escaped. Despite his actions, the Raven King had wanted to rescue him before all those antics occurred, and he apologized profusely once he found out that Reyson had joined the Mercenaries and that the Serenes Princess, Leanne, was still alive.\n\nTo make-up for his wrong-doings, Naesala had his squad of Raven warriors retreat from the battlefield, not wanting to face against Reyson any longer. He was not seen again until Gritnea Tower, where the Liberation Army were undergoing a rescue mission to save Leanne; she was kidnapped by the Black Knight previously. In the midst of battle, he was disguised as a Daein soldier and freed her along with his attendant, Nealuchi.\n\nIn the war between the Laguz Alliance and the Begnion Empire, Naesala sided with his brethren with the knowledge that the Senators were responsible for the Serenes Massacre, but he was forced to betray the Alliance with the curse of the Blood Pact looming over his nation. With these atrocities he was coerced to committing, he has become very critical of himself even as he fights for the lives of his people."
