        "text": "***** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POST *****\n\nCharacter Update\n\nLate game each character gets a specialized attack that uses their full ATB bar and has situational effects. Vanille gets Death which in this game has a very low success rate but does high damage on a miss. Lightning gets One Man Army which I used quite a bit. It’s her take on Omnislash: a combo attack with several sword slashes, shots from her gunblade, flips, and kicks. Its special is if an enemy is staggered it’ll really raise the chain damage. Thus, I used it a lot on staggered enemies. Good damage and chaining but I wish they’d given Lightning more quotes instead of having her say, “I’m no one’s slave!” every, single, time.\n\nThese attacks will never get picked by the AI so only you picking it for your leader will bring them out. I used Lightning a lot and in the whole final dungeon so I never got around to using most of the others’ attacks.\n\nOther than that the team got the -aga spells. In this game they’re not the most efficient for damage over time but they have AoE and can blast enemies into the air to disrupt them.\n\nDungeons and Bosses\n\nDungeon: Eden – It’s a warzone here in Cocoon’s capital. The l’Cie vs. Santcum military vs. Pulse invaders. There are lots of fights here where you go in and it’s Sanctum vs. Pulse before you arrive. It’s important to take advantage of this and help both sides whittle each other down before finishing both off because they love to throw some tough monster parties into these fights so if you don’t take advantage you’re in for a tough one.\n\nAnd there are lots of tough fights where you get no such advantage. First in my mind are the Humbabas, a type of Behemoth. The late game Behemoths follow a pattern where they’re not bad at first but get them to half HP and they stand up, fully healing themselves and gaining some very powerful attacks. You’re supposed to stagger them before they stand then Launch and juggle them to death. I was inept at this for some reason. I could kill them after standing with some difficulty but then they started throwing out fights with two at once and I’d just dodge those fights.\n\nDungeon: Orphan’s Cradle\n\nFF loves their flashy dungeons. Orphan’s Cradle is a colorful, dream-like dungeon made of data and hardware. The fal’Cie Eden shepherds you around by summoning platforms when you reach him. The platforms often resemble computer hardware and memory chips. The aesthetic is pretty cool. Navigation is actually confusing in some spots and there are branching paths that actually go for a bit. It felt more like an actual dungeon rather than the hallways that make up much of FF13.\n\nMaybe I just fought smarter but the monsters seemed easier for the most part. Fights might take some time but I generally wasn’t struggling to win and there were few fights I’d dodge on the basis of difficulty. When you catch up with Eden he’ll often teleport you to a miniboss fight before letting you advance. All but the last miniboss was pretty easy. The last miniboss had devastating single-target physical attacks. Its worst was a combo attack that’d debuff your physical defense and then quickly launch a powerful attack. The attack would OHKO anyone that wasn’t a Sentinel guarding. Had that happen to my leader at the end of the fight and that’s Game Over. Even keeping a Sentinel up is difficult. Then right after that miniboss all the minibosses begin showing up on the map as regular fights for the last section.\n\nBoss: Barthandelus Round 3 – Good ‘ole Barty is back for more. He’ll keep up a steady bombardment of lasers throughout the fight which provide constant damage and occasionally disrupt their target. He has two powerful attacks: Ultima and Thanotosian Laughter. Ultima is a big explosion of magical energy as it often is in FF’s. Doesn’t seem like the ultimate spell as it often is though; its damage was pretty manageable. Thanotosian Laughter was definitely more dangerous, consisting of a stream of lasers that do multiple hits to the whole group. Strategy for both attacks was to switch to a heavy defense Paradigm, including a Sentinel to reduce damage. This fight was mostly managing the constant stream of damage, making sure to always be ready for his two best attacks (especially later when he could do them in short succession), while still making progress on offense.\n\nI like how Barty continues trying to tempt the team mid-combat with quotes like, “Destroy the world that despises you,” and, “Fulfill your Focus and gain eternal life!”\n\nFinal Boss: Orphan\n\nFF final bosses usually have a few more tricks than just being damage machines, though that isn’t to say their tricks are always potent. Orphan is a good example of this. His Merciless Judgment has him rise from the pool he’s in to reveal most of his body is a gigantic sword. He then slams the sword down in an attack that always puts your party in low HP but can’t outright kill them. FF final bosses love attacks like that. There’s an extra bit of urgency in an action-based game where he might get a follow-up kill very quickly. And to make it worse, the game interface goes away during the attack and you can’t change Paradigms. Twice I got hit when in an offensive Paradigm and had to immediately switch to healing and defense. Thankfully, they apparently made it so he doesn’t immediately follow-up because they’d be BS if he just immediately popped the leader. I didn’t think about it at the time but he can inflict Poison and any Poisoned character is screwed by this attack. I did get Poisoned at one point and healed it sort of on accident: it wasn’t my priority to cure it.\n\nHis attacks other than that don’t do too much damage. After taking some damage he started throwing out some attacks that inflicted status ailments. I neglected to heal these at first and oh man that was a mistake. Next thing I know my whole team has a bunch of ailments including Daze, which makes characters almost helpless. My team was unable to act and being whittled away by the boss. And I didn’t know how long until his next big attack. Thus, I had to pull out a Summon.\n\nI didn’t use Summons much in the game so I never explained them. Summoning take 3 TP (max is 5). TP regenerates very slowly; it’ll likely take several fights to get just 1 TP back. Thus, Summoning is to be saved for dire situations. Your leader Summons their personal Eidolon (Lightning summons Odin) and they attack the enemy together until the Summon’s big finish. The big thing is that at the end of the Summon your team gets fully healed. Thus, one Summon and I was right back in it. And knowing not to let ailments pile up I made sure to heal any ailments immediately and I put Veil (buff that makes ailments less likely to stick, among other things) on the team. Things went much smoother after that.\n\nFor its final form Orphan starts by putting Doom on the Leader, effectively making it a time limit fight. Thankfully, Orphan’s Doom counter is a lot higher than the Eidolons’. Orphan is immune to all damage until staggered so it’s a rush to stagger him and then beat on him while he’s staggered. This form doesn’t deal any major damage; its offense is just to make you eventually need to heal and waste time. Orphan here is also vulnerable to several debuffs which you’ll want on it when its time to initiate a beatdown.\n\nI staggered Orphan in short order and managed to take off 3/4 of his HP. He got a bit more aggressive after that but not enough to cause problems. I had him close to staggered again with half the Doom counter left and then he used Temporal Hollow which reset his chain gauge. Don’t know if something I did triggered that or if he always uses it when on low HP and close to staggered. I built the chain gauge up again and this time staggered him. He was destroyed soon after with about 1/3 of the Doom counter left.\n\nDifficulty\n\nThe PC version came in at -2.16 while the PS3 got an 8.58. That’s a pretty noticeable difference and I haven’t found a concrete answer on why. I did see that the PC version has an Easy mode so perhaps the difference comes from people playing on Easy.\n\nPS3 version falls at 108th out of 152, near games like Super Mario World, Yoshi’s Island, and Dragon Quest Monsters 2.\n\nPC version falls at 133rd out of 152, near games like Chrono Trigger, Star Wars Battlefront 2 (the old one), and Project X Zone.\n\nMy experience was closer to the PS3’s score. That score puts it just below FF10 which seems like a good comparison.\n\nExternal Links\n\nNascent Requiem – Theme of the final battle. Mixes the hope of the l’Cie finally freeing themselves from their fate with the anxiety and urgency of the timed battle.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII voice actors sketch – I came across a link to this on TV Tropes and thought it was hilarious. What’s best is that this is completely in character for Lightning and Snow.\n\nConclusions on FF13\n\nFF13 was a fun, solid game. It wasn’t my favorite FF by far. I’ve mentioned a few of the things I found annoying about it. But it did some cool stuff too and the battle system was mostly fun. It made me curious to play the sequels at some point. If they truly are “FF13 done right” as I’ve heard then they could be great games. The story was interesting and kept me wanting to see what happened next too.\n\n***** PLOT SECTION *****\n\nOerba\n\nAs the team nears Oerba Fang begins to realize that Vanille has been hiding something. She confronts Vanille and finds out the truth: Fang is the one that became Ragnarok. That’s why Fang’s Brand is scorched and she has no memory of what happened. Vanille wanted to spare Fang the guilt.\n\nFang and Vanille remember Oerba being a vibrant and friendly town. Nobody had a specific house: the entire town was communal. It was also lush with plant life. When the team arrives they find it to be a wasteland. Buildings still remain but there’s no people. Hauntingly, the place is crawling with Cie’th, implying that at some point all the people were killed or turned to Cie’th. The eerie and depressing Dust to Dust plays throughout the area, even in battles, and fits very well.\n\nThe group somehow comes across Serah. Snow is flabbergasted but of course it’s a trick: it’s an illusion made by Barthandelus. He reiterates his orders for the l’Cie to kill Orphan and destroy Cocoon. They refuse again but he reveals he has multiple plans in place. He’s revived Cid and installed Cid as the new Primarch. Cid’s old group, the Calvary, see this as a massive betrayal. Barthandelus let the group know about a fal’Cie named Orphan without telling them how important Orphan is to Cocoon’s survival. Now the Calvary are on their way to kill Cid and Orphan. Meanwhile, Barthandelus has continued to sow the seeds of paranoia among the people. He says a few more moves and he can have people killing each other in the streets and initiating a massive bloodpath. Whether the l’Cie help him or not, Cocoon will soon be destroyed.\n\nBarthandelus again provides a ship to the l’Cie. The group needs to stop Cocoon’s destruction and this is their only way back so once again they have to take it.\n\nBattle of Eden\n\nThe group arrives back in Cocoon with lots of flair in an awesome cutscene. Soon after Barthandelus opens gates that transport the Pulse monsters and robots from the Ark to the streets of the capital city, Eden. The Sanctum military then shows up and a three-way battle ensues. The capital becomes a war zone. We see a scene of the Calvary confronting Cid. Cid has once again regained his will and welcomes death which his former comrades provide. The l’Cie rush to get to Orphan before the Calvary does.\n\nOne the way they come across Snow’s old group, NORA. I expected them to view Snow with suspicion or even attack the l’Cie. However, they don’t treat Snow any differently and pal around for a scene with Snow and the other l’Cie. It goes to show how good a job the game did of making the l’Cie seem on their own. They come across old friends of a character and I expected at least suspicion, if not a fight. For one of the only times all game a group of people didn’t treat the l’Cie any differently and stayed loyal to a l’Cie’d friend.\n\nThe group enters the capital building, Edenhall. They see some PSICOM soldiers instantly turned to Cie’th; the horrible fal’Cie don’t give them a Focus, giving the poor soldiers no chance. The group then encounters Colonel Rosch again. I haven’t mentioned Rosch but he’s a PSICOM officer that’s been very determined to capture the l’Cie. He attacks them twice in Eden. They defeat him and he’s left wounded. Rosch monologues that he knew many of the things he did, such as the Purge, were wrong but that he trusted in fal’Cie rule to be for the greater good. He looks upon his squad who are now all Cie’th corpses and laments he chose wrong. As his final acts of redemption he orders the rest of PSICOM to stop fighting and instead evacuate civilians and then sacrifices himself to cover the l’Cie.\n\nOrphan’s Cradle\n\nThe group arrives in the center of Edenhall expecting to find the Calvary. Instead they find a group of Cie’th. They realize that Barthandelus turned the Calvary into Cie’th. He never intended for them to get to Orphan at all; they were just pawns meant to manipulate the l’Cie. The group is pulled into a strange dream-like realm of data: Orphan’s Cradle. The fal’Cie Eden, under Barthandelus’s orders, ushers the group towards Orphan while throwing continuous trials at them meant to break their will.\n\nAt the end they find Barthandelus again. Barthandelus reveals the crystalized forms of Serah and Dajh and then shatters them before the group. This greatly upsets Snow and Sazh but Lightning helps the group keep their heads, proclaiming it only to be a trick. Barthandelus then tries to reason that with all the wars and fighting that men are involved in that Cocoon’s end is inevitable anyway, telling the l’Cie they may as well make it quick. Instead, the group fights Barthandelus. They defeat him and this time he sinks into a pool in the room. His bird familiar then flies in too.\n\nOut of the pool emerges a new fal’Cie, formed with Barthandelus as its dark left side and the bird into a female motherly form on the right: Orphan. Orphan monologues that it was tasked with two irreconcilable Focuses: build Cocoon strong enough to support humanity and yet weak enough for humans to die. Orphan is truly born now and has been born to die. Orphan engages the group in combat.\n\nAfter a round of combat Orphan reveals why humans are made l’Cie: fal’Cie are given a singular task a finite power for that task. Humans aspire and dream and accomplish their rising goals. Thus, fal’Cie sought to utilize humanity’s strengths.\n\nOrphan then really tries to break the l’Cie. He incapacitates the group and then tortures Vanille. When that isn’t enough he turns Lightning, Sazh, Snow, and Hope into Cie’th. It was powerful seeing Lightning’s Cie’th form pathetically try to grab her sword but being unable to with her mutilated arm. The Cie’th then attack Fang as Orphan calls for her to submit. She finally gives into her anger and begins turning into Ragnarok. As she grows in power she attacks Orphan in her rage, much to Orphan’s delight. However, then she sees a vision of all the time the l’Cie spent together and what they went through. This breaks her anger and she turns back to normal. Orphan then tortures Fang to get her to change back.\n\nThen a blast rocks Orphan and causes it to sink back into the pool. Lightning, Sazh, Snow, and Hope emerge to help Fang and Vanille. They say they were somewhere cold and dark and then they remembered all the group went through and something pushed them back. The shell that Barthandelus and his bird made up falls away and now only Orphan remains. Lightning declares that Orphan is pathetic because it gave up on life before being born while humans always look for more hope. They engage Orphan once more in combat and emerge victorious.\n\nCocoons’ Salvation\n\nThe world is saved from Orphan and fal’Cie rule but Orphan was still what kept Cocoon up. With Orphan’s death Cocoon is powered down and begins to fall towards Pulse. The six l’Cie are caught in free-fall. Fang and Vanille are separated from the rest. They decide to unleash the power of Ragnarok and transform. However, they transform out of a wish to save Cocoon rather than out of anger and despair. Thus, they keep their minds. Fang conjures a tower of flame from Pulse and Vanille conjures water to cool it. Then they combine their powers to form crystal around the cooled lava: a crystal pillar to hold up Cocoon.\n\nThe other four wake up on Pulse. Their Brands are gone; they’re finally free. Many people from Cocoon were already evacuated to Pulse by Rosch’s final order. Cocoon is saved and held aloft by the crystal pillar. Two figures approach the four from across the field: Serah and Dajh, now freed. The two reunite with their loved ones. Hope looks around but realizes that Fang and Vanille are gone. The camera goes inside the crystal pillar where the crystal forms of Fang and Vanille slumber.\n\nI saw it pointed out that the vision the group had at the beginning of the game is actually from the ending: they saw a disjointed vision of Fang and Vanille becoming Ragnarok and saving Cocoon.\n\nAnalects\n\nOne cool thing about the story and mythology of FF13 is that not all questions are answered yet. When you complete Missions on Pulse you unlock Analects, stories written from the perspective of once-living Pulse inhabitants. While Cocoon hates Pulse Pulse also hates Cocoon. They saw the upperworld as an abberation. Some being called Lindzei created Cocoon from Pulse and “seduced” people to migrate to the upperworld. Lindzei is thus referred to as a succubus and Fell Lindzei in the Pulse Analects.\n\nApparently the right side of Orphan, the light motherly side, is in the likeness of Lindzei. But there seems to be confusion as to what Lindzei itself is. Is Lindzei the Maker that Orphan and Barthandelus so desperately want to meet? Was Lindzei actually Barthandelus himself? Is Lindzei a fal’Cie?\n\n***** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT POST *****\n\nBackwards from FF12\n\nThere are some things that FF13 does better than FF12. But some of my most significant complaints on FF13 are things its immediate predecessor did better. First, there’s the Leader, who you control in fights. In FF12 you could freely switch the Leader at any time. In FF13 you can only switch out of battle. In FF12 if your Leader was taken out you would just switch. In FF13 your Leader goes down and it’s Game Over. Very annoying. Sometimes it doesn’t take long for enemies to suddenly gang up on the leader. Combine this with switching Paradigms not being a free action and ugh.\n\nNext complaint is that you can’t manually move your characters. I remember some fights in FF12 where I’d mitigate enemy AoE by spreading out. Can’t do that in FF13, at least not on purpose. I’ve had a Sentinel out drawing aggro and my other units still take shots because they keep standing right next to the Sentinel.\n\nA Forgiving Game\n\nA mitigating factor in these complaints is the FF13 is very, very forgiving. If you lose a fight you can just restart from right before the fight. No back to the title screen, just right before the fight happened. Since the game doesn’t have the typical “stock up in town then dungeon crawl” theme this kind of fits. Admittedly, this makes some parts which are supposed to be dangerous and epic in story seem less so. But I’ll take it in exchange for the complaints I listed above.\n\nCharacter Update\n\nThe characters all continue on with their three roles for a while. Eventually each one has the other three roles unlocked. However, each node on their non-main roles costs a lot of CP (this game’s EXP) for much less value. Thus, I just kept everyone in their main three roles.\n\nLightning – Still versatile but as buffs and debuffs have become more important her lack of either has emerged as a weakness. She was also a bit slower to gain the -ara spells (second tier of spells which mainly serve as AoE in this game) which cut down on her AoE capabilities.\n\nSazh – His offensive stats began to lag a bit behind the others. However, he’s still the only one with Haste and he has a lot of HP too.\n\nSnow – I began using Sentinel more to deal with fights where the enemy’s offense was just too overwhelming. Snow continues to have a boatload of HP such that I could give HP boosting equipment to the others and he’d still have more. No buffs or debuffs for him either; it’s just doing damage and taking it for him.\n\nHope – Get some HP kid! His HP has been slipping even more below the others such that I can give him HP boosters and he still won’t have as much. His defensive buffs are nice in long fights against heavy-offense foes but his low HP has been growing into a liability.\n\nVanille – With debuffs becoming more valuable Vanille’s stock has rose to match. She’s been getting AoE debuffs to help with groups too.\n\nFang – Debuffs and high HP. Fang is starting to lag quite a bit behind Snow on tanking but her debuffs make up for it. That said, her lack of base-Ravager can make chains slower in parties including her.\n\nChanging Battle Quotes\n\nOne nice touch to the game is the changing battle quotes. Lots of games have constant battle quotes throughout. FF13’s get updated with the story. For example, Lightning says very little in the early game. As times goes on and she warms up to the others she says more, especially in her time with Hope. The two will start encouraging each other. Similarly, Sazh and Vanille will banter back and forth.\n\nGran Pulse – The Hallway Ends\n\nAfter 25 hours of gameplay the hallway finally ended and I arrived at Gran Pulse. They’d been hyping Pulse all game as a wild place filled with monsters compared to the heavily urbanized Cocoon and it shows. The main area of Gran Pulse is a very large plain. The plain is pretty big for exploring on its own and there are some side areas you can go to too. Most of my time so far has been on Missions which are much like FF12’s Hunts: you are given the task of fighting some monster or group of monsters with rewards if you do so. Some of these Missions are essentially optional bosses. Certain Missions are used to unlock chocobos to ride on to give you more areas to explore.\n\nAnd don’t think you can stomp over everything, either. There are a lot of monsters here you’re just meant to avoid. Best example being the Adamantoises, gigantics turtles the size of a three-story building. I fought one out of curiosity and it one-shot my team by stomping near them (not sure if that was supposed to be a quake attack or if the collision detection was just a bit off). King Behemoths were too powerful for me early on too.\n\nOne complaint I have is that while they did implement fast travel for this area the fast travel nodes are unlocked by completing Missions and they’re too far apart. I’ve had to cross the main plain area several times for Missions. You couldn’t have some fast travel spots on the plains? Just a few to not have to run all the way across?\n\nAnyway, as opposed to the fake wilderness of Cocoon Gran Pulse feels like being out in the wild. They did a good job with this section.\n\nDungeons and Bosses\n\nThe Palamecia\n\nThis dungeon makes up the entirety of Chapter 9. You have two teams of l’Cie: Lightning, Snow, Hope, and Fang invading the ship and Sazh and Vanille escaping from the brig. The two groups fight through wave after wave of defenders including PSICOM, large battle droids, and monsters. Much of the dungeon is fought outside on wings and other structures. It’s also one of the first dungeons to break the hallway-model: there are several rooms with actual branching paths and large rooms with tiers and walkways. Don’t worry, there’s still hallways too. The dungeon does a great job of selling the scene of busting through the enemy’s aerial base.\n\nThat said, the dungeon last far too long, a common complaint with many dungeons. While there is a good variety of enemies the dungeon is long enough that you still have many repeats by the end. And the characters don’t do enough to inflict mayhem and damage on the ship itself, though there ends up being a reason for that.\n\nPerhaps the main thing that makes the dungeon too long is some of the fights. Many of the fights take a reasonable amount of time. Then there’s fights against the bigger enemies, such as the Vikings. The Vikings are big hovering armored droids. They have a ton of HP. They’re not even that difficult to take out, they just take forever. One Viking itself is a lengthy fight. They often show up in groups of three. Those fights take forever. Also, the branching paths give you one of the first cases where enemies respawn. So if you take a wrong turn or miss an item here or there, like I did, you could have extra fights against three Viking sets.\n\nBarthandelus\n\nAfter I beat this boss I told a friend that this boss pretty much sums up my opinion of FF13 in general: it was a fun fight but there were some annoyances to it. Barthandelus is a big fight both in terms of difficulty and story importance. The setting is impressive too, being on the bridge of a massive airship. The boss is big enough to earn five targets to hit. The main body is shielded until you take out the sides so this is pretty much a two-phase fight. In the first fight you target the sides while they blast you with magic. Nothing too devastating but you’re getting hit often enough that you need to watch your HP. As you eliminate targets the body will give buffs to the ones remaining and they’ll use more powerful spells to make up for fewer attacks.\n\nOnce the sides are taken out at first it seems like you can just wail on the main body. It’ll use the impressive looking Ruinga for some AoE but it’s not that bad to deal with. Then it’ll start charging its best attack, Destrudo. Destrudo sends out a bunch of Magic Missiles to hit the team for major damage. He charges it for almost half a minute so you have time to prepare. Frustratingly, his chain automatically resets to zero when he starts charging Destrudo. I’d use the charge team to get my team to full HP to weather the attack and then wail on him a bit until he actually launched the attack. Then it was time to recover again and repeat the process. He has no recovery time from Destrudo so you need to heal quickly to avoid getting picked off by follow ups.\n\nDestrudo is also the source of those annoyances I mentioned. See, it took me two tries to beat this boss and me losing on the first try was BS. In that fight I weathered three Destrudos. I had the boss around 20% HP, maybe less. I had a rhythm going. I think I proved that, unless the boss threw a curve ball or I slipped up that I had earned the win. Boss charges Destrudo again. I get my team to full HP. He launches Destrudo. This time Lightning goes down and she was the Leader so it’s Game Over.\n\nI did nothing different for that Destrudo. As far as I can tell there’s some RNG and the Magic Missiles aren’t guaranteed to be evenly spread. Note that Lightning survived the other three Destrudos. Note that she was the only one to get KO’d by it. Note that means Hope, who had much less HP and no greater defenses, did not get KO’d once by it. So the RNG basically just said, “You lose!” On my second try I put some equipment on Lightning to help guard against the attack. On the time she took the most damage I did the math and that equipment didn’t save her; she would’ve survived anyway. So just that one time the RNG decided to KO Lightning to troll me.\n\nI was so miffed by the attack I decided to try to look up if it is actually RNG like I suspected. I didn’t find confirmation on that but I found out there’s a way to weaken Destrudo: when the chain gauge resets if you wail on him and get it to 3/4 full half the Destrudo missiles won’t fire. I did this once on accident. The game does not hint at this, not even on his Libra page and the whole point of casting Libra is to get important details like that.\n\nCid Raines\n\nShortly after Barthandelus was another difficult and story-important fight. I found this one to be more fair. Cid is a l’Cie and so this is kind of like a mirror match as he’ll use a lot of your own abilities. He’ll even use Paradigms; you’ll get messages that he’s in Attach Phase, Defense, etc. Cid isn’t too bad in the first part of the fight but once you get his HP down a bit he uses Metamorphose and becomes a lot more powerful. All his Paradigms get a power boost and his offensive phases are particularly relentless.\n\nThe fight is mostly about reacting to what Cid does but often he acts so fast that you can’t take enough actions. His Commando-esque phase has him use a devastating physical combo and he can even Launch a character like you can. However, he’ll mostly target one person for this part so the reaction is to keep that person alive with a Medic while the other two can do what they wish. His healing and defense phases are reprieves from his assault for time to catch up on healing, remove his buffs, put on buffs, or just wail on him. He can buff himself and debuff you too. On my first try I foolishly let him keep his buffs and that was a bad mistake. Dispel his buffs immediately.\n\nLike Barthandelus he has a super move: Seraphic Ray. Unlike Barthandelus he doesn’t have a huge charge time for it so you just need to be ready. Really, this move is the main difficulty in the fight. It deals a ton of damage and removes buffs. When I did win he had me at the brink with only Lightning standing. I tried having her Summon, a move I don’t use often as it’s balanced to be very powerful but takes several battles to recharge, and did some damage to Cid. Apparently Summoning also restores your team once the Summon is done. From there I was able to fight smarter and whittle away the rest of Cid’s HP.\n\n***** PLOT SECTION *****\n\nVanille’s Deceit\n\nWhile the other four l’Cie fought their way through Palumpolum Sazh and Vanille continued their retreat. Sazh gets more and more depressed thinking of how he and the other l’Cie may need to die to save his son Dajh. Vanille tries to keep his spirits up but she also starts getting depressed. It turns out she and Fang are the reason Dajh became a l’Cie. Fang and Vanille woke up in the Vestige on Day 1. Fang didn’t remember their previous Focus at all but Vanille did. Vanille, however, didn’t want to play a part in any more killing so she lied and said she didn’t remember. Fang then rashly had them attack a Cocoon fal’Cie to jog their memories. That fal’Cie made Dajh a l’Cie in self-defense. It was after that Fang and Vanille were separated. Vanille can’t bring herself to tell Sazh this.\n\nThe two make their way to Nautilus, a big city in the middle of a parade. As they enjoy the festivities PSICOM finds them. As they fight their way through Dajh finds them. Sazh is flabbergasted at the appearance of his son. Dajh’s power to detect Pulse l’Cie led him to his father, the child not knowing the danger this placed them in. He then turns to crystal, his Focus complete, to Sazh’s dismay. Colonel Jihl Nabaat shows herself. She revels in the irony of Dajh causing his father’s downfall. She then sadistically reveals Vanille’s place in Dajh becoming a l’Cie to Sazh. She lets the two run off hoping to see Sazh kill Vanille. Sazh tries to bring himself to kill Vanille but can’t. Then he holds a gun to his own head…but he can’t bring himself to kill himself either and collapses in despair. The two are then captured.\n\nAssault on the Palamecia\n\nThe Sanctum announces they will publicly execute Sazh and Vanille. The two are held on the PSICOM flagship, the Palamecia. And the emperor Primarch himself, leader of Cocoon, is there as well. The l’Cie realize this is a trap but decide to mount a rescue mission anyways. With the help of Cid and his Calvary they board the Palamecia. Meanwhile, Sazh listens to Vanille’s story. Hearing Vanille reveal that she and Fang had turned to crystal and then woken up fills him with hope that his son will someday wake up too. The two then escape their cell.\n\nThe two groups eventually reunite and decide to press on to the bridge to confront the Primarch. As they proceed a number of things mysteriously go their way, such as a power outage on the ship. The l’Cie make it to the bridge. Jihl stands in front of the Primarch as his last defense. Then the Primarch surprises everyone by casting some magic and slaying Jihl and the entire bridge crew.\n\nThe Primarch reveals his true form: a fal’Cie named Barthandelus. He finally reveals the l’Cies’ focus: to destroy Cocoon. One of them is to become Ragnarok and destroy Orphan, which powers Cocoon. Snow denies this on the basis of Serah becoming crystal after telling them to save Cocoon. Barthandelus reveals her focus was to gather them to become l’Cie which ultimately was what happened; her words were meaningless. The group fights Barthandelus who ends up escaping but not before providing the l’Cie with a ship. With no other option they use the ship to escape the Palamecia.\n\nThe Terrible Focus\n\nThe ship leads the group to a warehouse of Pulse creatures and weapons inside the Cocoon capital of Eden. Fang and Vanille identify the place as an Ark, a place meant to train and test l’Cie. The group can’t fathom why Barthandelus, a Cocoon fal’Cie, would want them to destroy Cocoon. Nevertheless, Barthandelus’s words hang heavy on the group. Snow is hit particularly hard as he had fully believed Serah was right and that their focus was to save Cocoon. Lightning of all people has to pick his spirits up.\n\nAs they make their way through the Ark they are soon met by Cid. Most are glad to see him but Lightning immediately realizes something is wrong. Cid reveals that he too was made a l’Cie and that his Focus has been to help the group of six along their terrible Focus. In fact, the l’Cies’ survival and progress, including through the Palamecia, was guided by Barthandelus and his fal’Cie to help strengthen them so that one of them can become Ragnarok. As for why Barthandelus would want this Cid explains that the Cocoon fal’Cie want to bring the Maker back to the world. The Maker created fal’Cie and humans and then departed. Only a huge sacrifice, such as the sacrifice of the hundreds of millions living on Cocoon, could call the Maker back. But for all their power the Cocoon fal’Cie are unable to destroy the world they created and nurtured.\n\nThe group denounces Cid for turning his back on his self-proclaimed dream of living outside of fal’Cie rule. Cid admits he had those dreams long ago before he became a l’Cie. Now, he’s been inspired watching the Pulse l’Cie fight against their fates. It’s reawakened his will and he decides he will be a pawn no longer. He attacks the Pulse l’Cie, proclaiming that if he kills them he will have successfully rebelled against Barthandelus. Cid is defeated and mysteriously turns to crystal, even though being defeated by them could not have been his Focus.\n\nSoon after the group finds a Pulse ship and a gate leading to Pulse. They decide to go to the lowerworld. At this point every ship the team has piloted has gotten shot up so it’s pretty much a recurring joke at this point. Sure enough, they’re soon attacked in what was a cool scene. Also, I love the sass from Hope towards the end: Welcome to Gran Pulse.\n\nGran Pulse\n\nThe team resolves to find some way to escape their Focus without destroying Cocoon. The group explores Gran Pulse but find no other humans; just monsters and ruins. Their Brands continue advancing, signaling they have little time left before they become Cie’th. Morale begins lowering. The l’Cie soon after decide to go to Fang’s and Vanille’s hometown: Oerba.\n\nAs the group explores Vanille explains why she tried to run away from their Focus and lied to Fang: Vanille became Ragnarok in the War of Transgression. She killed tons of people as she cracked Cocoon’s shell.\n\nOne of the themes throughout the first part is how some of the l’Cie deal with their cruel fate by throwing themselves into constant combat. Now, at this point where there is less action in the story it sinks in more that they’re running out of time. Also, Gran Pulse is open and beautiful but with no humans feels a bit lonely. That said, there are some nice optional scenes around Gran Pulse to build up the character interaction between the characters.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII was released in 2009 for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, the series’ first entry to be on multiple platforms at release. In a series with few sequels it would later spawn two sequels.\n\nWith my most recent Playstation being the PS2 and not owning an Xbox my fandom for new games in the series has been on a long hiatus. I watched a friend of mine play through the beginning shortly after its launch. Since then I resolved not to spoil myself on it in case I ever played it. And so I go into this game almost blind. I’ve heard bits and pieces about the game over the years. FF is one of those series where seemingly every new entry causes division in the fanbase with there being love and hate for every entry since FF8. Honestly, I’d heard more negative than positive about this one.\n\nI’m playing the Steam version for this. It took almost 2 days to install and my computer can barely handle it, with noticeable lag in spots. Sounds like the Steam version isn’t the greatest port, a common issue in FF ports, as even some dedicated gaming rigs have had issues.\n\nThe Long Hallway\n\nOne complaint I’ve often heard about FF13 is that it’s very linear. That’s…quite accurate. The game to this point has pretty much been a long hallway. Any branches are very short and generally lead to one item and maybe some enemies guarding that item. There are 2D Mario levels with more to explore.\n\nI’m not generally a “it’s linear so it sucks” person but admittedly the game is so linear that it hurts immersion. This definitely strengthens the argument of the “they don’t want to make games, they want to make movies” crowd. The areas are pretty long too so with no exploration it makes every area overstay its welcome.\n\nThis was most comical when I reached a military-held forest. The flavor text said the forest was great for the military because it was so maze-like that anyone not familiar with the area would get lost. Gameplay wise, nope! It was the same straight line with small branches as any other area.\n\nATB System\n\nFF13 uses a variation of the ATB system but it’s the most real-time game I’ve played yet. The ATB gauge continuously charges up to a max of 3 bars (which gets extended by certain events). You spend these bars on actions. Most actions cost a bar while some cost two. By default you wait until all your bars are filled and then execute all queued actions in sequence but you can manually execute any actions you have the bars for with a button press. This makes FF13 the most chaotic, action-based battle system of any FF I’ve played yet.\n\nChains and Staggering\n\nThe main form of offense in FF13 is to focus attacks on a target to build up their chain gauge. The chain gauge is filled with each attack. As the chain gauge fills they take more damage. You can’t delay once you’ve built up the gauge either because a red bar will start filling the chain bar and if it does your chain goes back to 0. If you completely fill the chain gauge the enemy is staggered. Staggered enemies have their gauge then gradually deplete but during this time they take increased damage that keeps increasing with each attack. Usually this will be anywhere from 250% to 400% damage when stagger begins. Staggered enemies also show different behaviors. Most enemies stop using their best attacks while staggered. Armored enemies lose their armor and so staggering them is the only way to beat them in a reasonable time.\n\nThe two offensive roles (see below on roles and paradigms), Commando and Ravager, are best for doing damage and building chains. Ravager builds the chain faster but the red bar will erase your chain quickly. Attacks from a Commando don’t build the chain quickly but drastically slow down the red bar. Thus, a combination of a Commando and Ravagers is best for building a chain, though you can switch to all Ravagers once you get close enough.\n\nRoles and Paradigms\n\nFF13 has an interesting take on tactics in an action-RPG. You can only control the Leader character. All characters can use the abilities and act according to their assigned role. Roles make up Paradigms which you create out of battle. In battle you can switch between the Paradigms you made. For example, you could make a Paradigm of Commando-Ravager-Medic where two characters hit an enemy and build its chain while the other heals them. I often go to Commando-Ravager-Ravager as described above. Roles do more than just control the AI; you can only use the abilities of your current role. So if you’re in Commando-Ravager-Ravager and need to heal someone you need to switch to a Paradigm that has Medic to even have the option of using healing spells.\n\nOne annoyance that I know has really ticked a lot of other people off is that when you switch Paradigms the battle doesn’t stop. Thus, you’ll likely take some hits while switching and you’ll lose some time on your chain gauges. At least the ATB bar continues to build while switching. Overall, you need to anticipate when you might need to switch.\n\nHere are the roles:\n\nCommando – Physical attacker. Boosted damage. Good at sustaining chains.\n\nRavager – Magical attacker. Good at building chains.\n\nMedic – Healer. Heals things.\n\nSynergist – Buffs the team.\n\nSaboteur – Debuffs the enemy.\n\nSentinel – Defender. Lowers damage to team. Draws aggro and defends.\n\nCharacters\n\nIt just occurred to me while typing this that four of the six PCs have nouns as their name.\n\nLightning – The main character and a well balanced fighter. Good strength and magic. Average HP. Her roles are Commando, Ravager, and Medic. I generally keep her in offensive roles but she can be a healer in a pinch. For elements she focuses on lightning and fire but she has some water and wind too. She’s pretty acrobatic in her animations with plenty of flips and spins.\n\nSazh – He wields guns and this is a jRPG so his physical attacks are weaker than those using swords, spears, or even their fists. His magic is better but he can be Commando if need be. Roles are Commando, Ravager, and Synergist. His buffs focus on increasing offense and he has the always amazing Haste spell. His attack animations are pretty goofy. His first attack is a pretty standard “video game character with two pistols” stance. But then for consecutive attacks he does weird trick shots like shooting from behind his back or, my favorite, shooting his guns from behind his head while unnecessarily standing on one leg. Fire is his favorite element.\n\nSnow – The tank and a brawler. His attacks are simple but powerful: he runs up to the enemy and launches punches and kicks. His roles are Commando, Ravager, and Sentinel. Easily has the most HP of the bunch. Also likes ice for his element, fitting with his name.\n\nA complaint about his use of fists and the short range that comes with that. All melee characters will Launch a staggered enemy. This puts the enemy high in the air. All melee characters can jump up and hover while they combo a Launched enemy. However, sometimes the character jumps too high. I don’t know if this is actually an issue with FF13 or if my game lags just enough to throw the timing of the jump-then-combo off. Lightning and especially Fang with their weapons usually still reach the enemy. Snow, meanwhile, will sometimes miss half his combo because he jumps too high and suddenly can’t reach the enemy.\n\nVanille – Closest to the old school black mage. Doesn’t even have physical attacks once you gain Paradigms. Her roles are Ravager, Medic, and Saboteur. Her debuffs focus on lowering the defenses of the enemy. Her favored element is wind. One of my main two healers.\n\nHope – Closest to the old school white mage. Also doesn’t have physical attacks after Paradigms. His roles are Ravager, Medic, and Synergist. His buffs raise defenses so between that and his Medic role he’s pretty focused on keeping the team alive. Focuses on fire first as his element. Every character’s spell animation is some form of waving their hand forward. Special recognition to Hope who waves his hand with such zeal that if he goes high to low he almost touches the ground and just in general looks like he’s exerting a lot of real, physical effort to cast his spells.\n\nFang – The lancer. While Snow has the highest strength Fang doesn’t have the airborne issue I mentioned for him and so Fang is the best physical attacker so far. Her roles are Commando, Saboteur, and Sentinel, making her the only PC not to get Ravager. Thus, she’s a bit weak on magic damage and chain building but otherwise a great fit for Commando. She gains the nice Slow spell in Saboteur.\n\nDungeons/Bosses\n\nDungeon: Hanging Edge\n\nThe intro area. A futuristic military-controlled restricted area. It used to be a city and so there’s roads everywhere. There are soldiers and airships everywhere. As battle rages all around parts of the road get destroyed and debris goes everywhere. It’s a pretty great atmosphere and, like many FF games, FF13 knows how to start with action. The intro area does a fair job of introducing you to the various mechanics of the game while staying interesting. Come to think of it, between the futuristic theme and the highways it reminds me of the intro highway level in Mega Man X.\n\nBoss: Manasvin Warmech – The first boss with Paradigms. There is a tutorial on switching Paradigms where it recommends you stay in Relentless Assault (Commando/Ravager/Ravager) as long as possible and only go to Solidarity (Commando/Sentinel/Medic) when you need to heal. Problem is the boss starts with a decent AoE attack to knock off 1/3 of the party’s HP then follows it up with an attack that knocks off the remaining 2/3. I would’ve thought, especially after the tutorial said to keep up the attack as long as possible, that I would stay in Relentless Assault longer than a round. Nope, need to switch right after the first attack. However, after surviving the initial wave the battle is pretty straight-forward.\n\nEidolen Boss: Shiva Sisters, Stiria and Nyx – Eidolens, the FF summon monsters, are once again fought to obtain. However, fights with them work differently. They start by casting Doom on your leader so you have to finish them quickly. However, the goal isn’t to deplete their HP. They get a Gestalt Gauge that fills with various methods. In this case, it’s defense. You only get Snow for this fight. The trick is to put him in Sentinel and have him defend when the attacking sister attacks. This builds the gauge. Once it gets high enough you push a button to end the battle.\n\nEidolen Boss: Odin\n\nThe Eidolen fights have all been difficult so far, requiring either a second try or taking me to the brink on the first. To build the Gestalt Gauge here you need to build up a chain. Problem is you only have Lightning and Hope for this fight and Odin hits like a truck. Hope can keep the two alive and lessen the damage but Odin is relentless. At some point you need to press the offense with both of them. I needed to play chicken a few times to keep the chain going yet bank on staying alive through the next onslaught.\n\nDungeon: Palumpolum\n\nOne of the themes of FF13 is that the world is literally against you. Thus, the otherwise peaceful hometown of Hope quickly becomes a war zone after you arrive as the military tries to catch you. At one point even the people form a mob and come after you. There are soldiers walking and flying all around. You climb over buildings and through sewers to stay out of the open as much as possible. FF has had dungeon-towns before but they’re usually wretched hives of scum and villainy or bleak and enemy controlled. This town would clearly be a town to restock and rest at in a different RPG. That it’s a danger zone in this one helps differentiate FF13.\n\nMusic\n\nI am loving the music of FF13! There are a lot of great songs and many of them often get stuck in my head. Here are a few that have stuck out to me:\n\nThe Promise – The main theme of FF13. A melancholic tune with a hint of hope, fitting well with the themes of the game.\n\nThe Sunleth Waterscape – The theme of a lighter-themed dungeon. An upbeat version of the main theme.\n\nBlinded by Light – The battle theme. It’s a good sign when you don’t get sick of the battle theme no matter how often it plays. I especially love when the strings really kick in around the minute mark.\n\nSaber’s Edge – The boss theme. This game has some great battle music.\n\n***** PLOT SECTION *****\n\nTwo Worlds, Fal’Cie, and L’Cie\n\nThe setting of the game consists of two worlds: the upperworld Cocoon and the lowerworld Pulse. The people of Cocoon are terrified of anything to do with Pulse since centuries ago Pulse tried to destroy Cocoon in the War of Transgression. Both worlds include very powerful beings called Fal’Cie. The Fal’Cie of Cocoon do things like provide the sun, increase food production, and other things to help the world flourish.\n\nAll Fal’Cie can enthrall humans to be their servants, called L’Cie. L’Cie are given magical powers to fulfill a task, a Focus, given by the Fal’Cie that bound them. They are also branded with Cocoon and Pulse brands being distinct. L’Cie who do not complete their task in some amount of time are given a fate worse than death: they are transformed into C’ieth, basically zombies. It’s not much better for L’Cie that fulfill their Focus; they are given “the gift of eternity”… in the form of crystal stasis.\n\nThe Thirteen Days\n\nThe immediate backstory to the game is called the Thirteen Days. An elaborate structure called a Vestige was near the city of Bodhum on Cocoon. It was a curiosity but had no entrance and so little was known about it. On Day One an entrance suddenly appeared. A young woman named Serah ventured inside and stumbled upon a Pulse Fal’Cie, Anima. Anima made Serah into a L’Cie. Besides the terribleness inherently associated with being a L’Cie it was extra bad for Serah to be a Pulse L’Cie; the people of Cocoon fear Pulse contamination as a Pulse L’Cie might try to kill them to avoid becoming a C’ieth.\n\nOn Day 11 Bodhum has its annual festival, complete with fireworks. Snow, the leader of a local militia called NORA and Serah’s boyfriend, resolves to stick with Serah and figure out a way to save her. He proposes at the fireworks show. Serah’s sister, Lightning, is a soldier in the Guardian Corps, a division of the Cocoon military focused on protecting the people from monsters. Lightning is not yet aware of Serah’s condition and is informed by her superior that he intends to recommend her for a promotion. A teenage boy, Hope, watches the fireworks happily with his mother. A civilian pilot, Sazh, watches with his young son, Dajh. All are happy, the calm before the storm.\n\nOn Day 12 PSICOM, a special forces division of the Cocoon military, chases after Serah and Snow. Snow has Serah jump onto the vestige but then the vestige takes her.\n\nOn Day 13, the people have become aware of the Pulse Fal’Cie near Bodhum and are panicked, wondering if the city is crawling with Pulse L’Cie at this point. The Sanctum, the Cocoon government, starts the Purge: they will force all the people in Bodhum to move to Pulse so they cannot threaten Cocoon.\n\nThe Purge\n\nSnow leads NORA in an effort to save Serah and those being forced into the Purge. As it turns out, the relocation is a front; PSICOM just shoots them down at a certain point. His group frees a train full of people and asks some of them to take arms with them. Hope’s mother does so while Hope is too afraid to move.\n\nHope’s mother soon dies protecting Snow as Hope watches. Snow feels guilt over the incident but doesn’t know who the woman’s son is. Meanwhile, Hope blames Snow for his mother’s death. He wants to tell Snow off for his recklessness but can’t summon the courage to do so. A young woman named Vanille convinces him to go after Snow, who heads into the vestige.\n\nI remember from watching years ago being exasperated at Hope. He wants to tell Snow off and actually yells at him a couple times but then stops short every time. Then Vanille convinces him to go after Snow into the vestige, which is ridiculously dangerous. I had thought Vanille was at least a childhood friend of his but then he asks, “What’s your name?” Are you kidding me!? You can’t bring yourself to yell at a guy you blame for your mom’s death but then you let some girl you don’t even know convince you to go to a place that could get you marked as an enemy of your homeworld and much worse!?\n\nMeanwhile, Lightning, who could never stand Snow or his group, is going after Serah on her own. Sazh is on the train she was on and after she derails it tags along with her. He seems to have a vendetta against the Pulse Fal’Cie too. Lightning, Sazh, Snow, Hope, and Vanille all converge at the door before the Fal’Cie. They find Serah there. Serah begs them to save Cocoon. Soon after she turns to crystal, apparently having fulfilled her focus. The group responds with a mixture of sadness and rage. Lightning, Snow, and Sazh go on to face Anima for what it did to Serah.\n\nAnima is defeated but then it enthralls the five and turns them into L’Cie. They all have a vision of a horrible monster, Ragnarok, tearing Cocoon apart. Most of them deduce that their focus is to bring forth Ragnarok. Snow refuses to believe that, citing the fact Serah fulfilled her focus when telling them to protect Cocoon. He resolves to save Serah and Cocoon but has no plan how to do so, to the frustration of the others, especially Lightning and Hope.\n\nRunning From Fate – Sazh and Vanille\n\nThe group of L’Cie soon split apart. Lacking the blind optimism of Snow and the rage of Lightning and Hope Sazh and Vanille end up paired and try just to survive and escape the Cocoon military. Vanille is an energetic girl and she at first keeps Sazh’s spirits up. But Sazh gets more and more depressed as they go.\n\nTurns out that Sazh’s young son, Dajh, became a Cocoon L’Cie at Euride Gorge. On Day 5, Some Pulse L’Cie attacked the Fal’Cie there and the Fal’Cie reached out to the only living thing close by at the time: Dajh. Dajh gained the ability to sense Pulse L’Cie but what chance did such a young boy have of fulfilling his Focus, especially without knowing what it is? Colonel Jihl Nabaat of PSICOM ran some tests to help the two learn Dajh’s focus. It was Dajh who led PSICOM to Anima, though on accident. As they journey Sazh begins to wonder if Dajh’s focus is the elimination of Pulse L’Cie. Would Sazh and the other L’Cie have to die to save Dajh?\n\nFighting Fate – Lightning, Hope, and Snow\n\nMost of the early portion of the game focuses on Lightning and Hope. Snow is first to leave the others as he stays behind to watch over Serah’s crystalized form as PSICOM closes in. Fortunately he’s caught by a rogue faction called the Calvary led by Cid Raines.\n\nCid even has another Pulse L’Cie, Fang, working with him. Cid wishes to free Cocoon from the rule of the Fal’Cie.\n\nMeanwhile, Lightning and Hope form an unlikely duo. Lightning blames the Fal’Cie for ruining hers and her sister’s lives. The Fal’Cie Eden is known to be the leader of the Sanctum, Cocoon’s government, which means the Cocoon Fal’Cie ordered the Purge and the killing of innocents too. Lightning’s rage causes her to want to take Eden out.\n\nHope still wants the strength to confront Snow. He realizes he’s the weakest of the group so goes with Lightning hoping the soldier will toughen him up. Lightning tries to leave Hope, saying he’s a burden and slowing her down. But Hope persists and Lightning begins to see a younger version of herself in the determined boy. When she was younger she and Serah were left orphans. She adopted a new persona (Lightning is not her real name) to protect Serah. After this she gives Hope a knife to signify his growing toughness.\n\nAs they journey and Hope begins recklessly throwing himself into combat Lightning begins to doubt her own motivations. She realizes that she needed a target to cope with the horrible things that had happened to them. As Hope talks more and more of getting revenge on Snow Lightning regrets egging him on. She realizes that when Serah became a L’Cie Snow believed in Serah and stood by her. When Lightning found out she refused to believe it and pushed Serah away.\n\nPalumpolum\n\nLightning and Hope come to the city of Palumpolum, Hope’s hometown. They are quickly spotted by PSICOM. Seemingly hopeless, Snow appears and helps them break out of being surrounded. Lightning resolves to protect Hope and so pushes the boy to Snow while she goes to distract their pursuers. Lightning figures to sacrifice herself but is helped by Fang, who accompanied Snow. The two pairs are split up.\n\nI loved the scene that came next. Fang calls Snow to set up a rendezvous point: Hope’s house. Lightning realizes with Hope’s festering anger that it’s dangerous having those two together. She tries to warn Snow and tell him of Hope’s vendetta against him. However, the phone is handed over to Hope before she can finish. Then she tries to convince Hope to give up on his revenge. At the same time, Hope tries to tell Lightning that he plans to carry his vengeance out. There is interference on the line and neither can hear the other.\n\nFang gives her backstory to Lightning as they make their way to Hope’s home. Fang and Vanille are both from Pulse and were already L’Cies. They fulfilled their Focus and turned to crystal and, centuries later, woke up on Day One. They couldn’t remember anything to do with their Focus. Fang’s Brand was scorched, signifying she was free, but Vanille’s was not. Desperate to save her Fang had them cause some mayhem at Euride Gorge; they were the L’Cie that attacked there and caused Dajh to become a L’Cie. Their awakening also opened the vestige. Lightning is both angered and filled with hope: their awakening means Serah will one day awaken.\n\nHope and Snow make their way to Hope’s home. Snow continues his big heroic talk, unaware he is making Hope angrier and angrier. Finally, Hope confronts Snow and reveals who his mother was. Hope blasts Snow with magic to leave him dangling on the edge of a building. Hope pulls Lightning’s dagger to finish Snow but his magic got the attention of an enemy airship which blasts the building. Hope is blown off the building and Snow grabs him in midair and shields him from the fall, taking grievous wounds in the process.\n\nHope eventually wakes up to find Snow carrying him. He is amazed that Snow would save someone who tried to kill him. Snow drops his big-talking heroics and reveals he has been feeling deep guilt but had no idea how to redeem himself. Lightning and Fang find the two and help Hope fight off enemies as Snow collapses from his wounds. Hope and Snow were the two I found most annoying but the game did a good job of weaving a plot that was very interesting.\n\nThe four finally get to Hope’s home where he meets with his dad. Hope’s dad encourages him though he feels powerless to help his son. He tells Hope that he must make his own choices and that he will stand by Hope no matter his choice."
