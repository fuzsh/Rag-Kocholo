The concert will include a wide variety of musical styles. Whether you're a fan of classical, jazz, or contemporary tunes, our 50th Birthday celebration promises to deliver a diverse repertoire that will leave you spellbound.\n\nPrepare to be enchanted by the talents of renowned musicians from around the Willamette Valley as they come together to create an extraordinary musical experience. Jeff Witt will return as our featured vocalist.

Jones and symphonies by Aaron Copland and Julie Giroux.\n\nThe concert will feature the Oregon premiere of the band version of An Impulse to Soar, originally written for the Aspen Contemporary Ensemble. David Jones was commissioned by a consortium of seven ensembles, including Salem Symphonic Winds, to transcribe the work for concert band. The expanded work takes full advantage of all the sounds and soloists within the band.\n\n“I began writing this work in April 2020, when the world was shutting down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, performances everywhere were being canceled, and life was filled with anxiety, uncertainty, and fear. I felt inspired to write something filled with optimism and hope for the future,” said Jones. “The title of the piece is based on a quotation by Helen Keller:\n\n‘One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.’\n\nWhen deciding on the title, I felt that the Helen Keller quotation perfectly embodied this spirit of joy and optimism in the face of hardship, courage in the face of oppression, and hope in the face of fear.”\n\nAaron Copland has long been celebrated as the “Dean of American Composers.” His Fanfare for the Common Man was written in 1942, as America was entering World War II, inspired partly by a speech by Vice President Henry Wallace, proclaiming the dawning of the “Century of the Common Man.” It has since become one of his best-known and popular works. The fanfare appears in many guises in Copland’s Third Symphony. There are hints of it with fragments presented in the first three movements. In movement four, it receives a quiet, reflective introduction from woodwind soloists before a full presentation in all its glory from the brass and percussion, with a wonderful exploration of all of its possibilities from the full ensemble to complete the work.\n\nSALEM SYMPHONIC WINDS brings the Third Symphony to Salem courtesy of the transcription for band by\n\nJames Hile, Director of Band at Elmhurst University.\n\nIn Symphony No. 1 – Culloden, Julie Giroux celebrates everything Scottish – at least everything that happened in Scotland between 1745 and 1746. On 16 April 1746, around 1,300 men were slain in the Battle of Culloden. Giroux reflects on the history and culture by arranging more than twenty-four tunes from the time. You won’t encounter any bagpipes or fiddles in the hall, but a wealth of soloists in the band will step up to bring you this rich musical panorama. The symphony and our season will conclude with ample time left in the evening to find and retire to your favorite dining spot for haggis and an appropriate beverage. While the wearing of kilts and sporrans to the concert is not required, it will be warmly tolerated by the band.\n\nThe concert will be presented in the beautiful new Rose Auditorium at South Salem High School. The auditorium is accessible via a ramp next to the main entrance and from the lobby to the lower level of the auditorium via an elevator. The auditorium entrance is located at 700 Howard Street SE in Salem. Seating in the reserved section is available for $25. General admission seating is available for adults for $20, Senior Citizens (60 & older) for $15, College/University Students for $10, and Youth (18 & under) for $5.

Donald Hunsberger arranged five movements to display the excitement, beauty, and contrast of William's writing.\n\nThrough her Symphony No. 6 The Blue Marble and its associated film, composer Julie Giroux brings us back to Earth. In three movements she celebrates our planet and implores us to preserve it. \"I hope The Blue Marble fills hearts & minds with a renewed love for our planet, our one and only home. Earth is the one thing we all have in common. It does not belong to us. We belong to it. It is our only home and we should always treat it as such with every generation leaving it healthier & happier than the way they found it.\"\n\nIn the first movement, The Blue Marble, we are brought home from space. In the second, \"Voices in Green\", we are transported to an exotic view of a rainforest. In the final movement, \"Let there be Life\", she depicts all aspects of life on earth. \"The miracle of Earth is life. It is the fragile, silken thread that holds existence together. As with the famous Blue Marble photograph, I hope this symphony reminds people just how frail and beautiful Earth is.\" Both the film and the music are stunningly beautiful. We are thrilled to present these in anticipation of Earth Day celebrations.\n\nW e will complete our performance with Symphonies of Gaia by Northwest-born composer, Jayce Ogren. He said of the work, \"Growing up in the Pacific Northwest shaped my life in a number of important ways. I have always felt more comfortable in the rainforest, ocean, or mountains than in the concrete walls of city life. My deep love of nature and close proximity to intense environmental conflict in my hometown were my greatest influences in writing Symphonies of Gaia. The work depicts the mystical beauty of the earth, as well as the disrespect and abuse it has endured throughout time.\n\nGaia is the Titan goddess of the earth in Greek mythology and has since become a universal symbol for ecological stewardship and wisdom. My most sincere hope is that Symphonies of Gaia will, in some form, inspirit others to understand and take action against the environmental crises we now so desperately face.\"\n\nView Event →\n\nSalem Symphonic Winds presents \"Maria de Buenos Aires Tango Suite\" at South Salem H.S.

Eventbrite Ticketing! Click the link below.\n\nMAGICAL TALES\n\nMusical Stories for Children of All Ages!\n\nOver the centuries, tribal elders, parents, and grandparents have passed on cultural heritage and wisdom through storytelling around the bonfire or late at night to send their children to sleep and dreamland. We will present our concert with Spanish narration with Paz Garcia and Arturo Sarmiento on Saturday, October 22nd.\n\nIn the first concert of our 48th season, we celebrate the aural tradition of storytelling with music inspired by classic stories composed by several of our favorite composers. We will premiere a new arrangement of The Legend of La Llorona by Larry Harrington. The story of La Llorona has roots deep in Mexican history. Some versions of the legend are traced back to Aztec creation stories. Many variations in folk songs, poems, and stories are well known in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Some are love stories, but most involve a ghost grieving and looking for her lost children. This version of the story is often associated with honoring the Day of the Dead or Dia de los Muertos, a Latin American celebration of life and death.\n\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving presents us with another ghost story set in New York’s Hudson Valley just after the American Revolution. It features the schoolmaster Ichabod Crane and his adversary, the Headless Horseman. The story has inspired movies, plays, and songs by popular artists. We will present the narrated version of the story composed by James Stephenson.\n\nDuring our 48th season, we will perform three of Julie Giroux’s six symphonies. This concert will feature her Symphony No. 2, A Symphony of Fables. The work is based on five fables: two by Aesop, The Lion and the Mouse and The Tortoise and the Hare; the Hans Christian Andersen tale, The Ugly Duckling; a German tale, The Pied Piper of Hamelin; and a Norwegian story, The Three Billy Goats Gruff.\n\nKenneth Grahame wrote the children’s novel The Wind in the Willows, first published in 1908. The book was originally a series of short bedtime stories he wrote to read to his young son Alastair. They involved the animals that lived on and around a river, including Mole, Rat, Mr. Toad, and Mr. Badger. Johan de Meij used four sections of the novel in his symphonic setting, The Wind in the Willows. It includes the following movements: The River, Ratty and Mole, Mr. Toad (which includes a spectacular car crash), and The Return of Ulysses.\n\nJohn Williams has written film scores for over 75 films, including nine Star Wars films, four Indiana Jones films, and three Harry Potter films. In this concert, we will perform Harry’s Wondrous World from HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER’S STONE and the Superman March from SUPERMAN. Plan on joining us at our concert in April to hear an arrangement of his music from Star Wars films.\n\nView Event →\n\nMagical Tales (Spanish Narration)\n\nVenta de entradas de Eventbrite! ¡Haz clic en el botón de abajo para comprar boletos!\n\nCuentos Mágicos\n\nCuentos musicales para niños de todas las edades\n\nA lo largo de los siglos, los ancianos tribales, los padres y los abuelos han transmitido la herencia cultural y la sabiduría a través de la narración de cuentos alrededor de la fogata o a altas horas de la noche para enviar a sus hijos a dormir y a la tierra de los sueños.

Presentaremos la versión narrada del cuento compuesta por James Stephenson.\n\nDurante nuestra temporada número 48, interpretaremos tres de las seis sinfonías de Julie Giroux. Este concierto contará con su Sinfonía No. 2, Una Sinfonía de Fábulas. La obra se basa en cinco fábulas: dos de Esopo, El león y el ratón y La tortuga y la liebre; el cuento de Hans Christian Andersen, El patito feo; un cuento alemán, El flautista de Hamelín; y una historia noruega, The Three Billy Goats Gruff.\n\nKenneth Grahame escribió la novela infantil The Wind in the Willows, publicada por primera vez en 1908. El libro era originalmente una serie de cuentos cortos para dormir que escribió para leerle a su pequeño hijo Alastair. Involucraron a los animales que vivían en y alrededor de un río, incluidos Mole, Rat, Mr. Toad y Mr. Badger. Johan de Meij usó cuatro secciones de la novela en su escenario sinfónico, El viento en los sauces. Incluye los siguientes movimientos: The River, Ratty and Mole, Mr. Toad (que incluye un espectacular accidente automovilístico) y The Return of Ulysses.\n\nJohn Williams ha escrito bandas sonoras para más de 75 películas, incluidas nueve películas de Star Wars, cuatro películas de Indiana Jones y tres películas de Harry Potter.
