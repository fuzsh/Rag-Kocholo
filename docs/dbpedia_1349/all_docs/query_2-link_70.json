        "text": "I know.\n\nI'm just saying even if the song was in, it wouldn't make a bit of difference for me.\n\nJust my opinion about video game music and the fact that it has never had the effect that other music can have on me. (No emotional response whatsoever except, this song blows, etc.)\n\nAlthough I've found that if a game can come up with good music to match up perfectly with the game, the whole experience is heightened greatly.\n\nFor example, Bioshock. For me anyways.\n\nExcept that was written for Final Fantasy VIII and fit the game perfectly. Plus it's a beautiful song.\n\nSo very true.\n\nedit: I just read the silliest thing on some random website:\n\nThis is a sign that video games really are turning into a big boy entertainment business that's not just aiming for teenage boys with an excess of adrenaline. Most blockbuster movies, for instance, have music albums that accompany them and feature elements for both women and men. Iron Man is a perfect example; it had action, yes, but it also had a relatable female character/love interest in Pepper Potts and plenty of humor.\n\nThe Lewis song is also a keen acknowledgement by RCA and Square Enix that casual game players are among the fans of Final Fantasy. In many cases, there are those who simply watch the story unfold while someone else plays. This song reaches out to non-gamers (particularly women) who might be intimidated by a complex RPG title, along with fans of mainstream music who may have only heard of Final Fantasy in passing before this, let alone played a game in the franchise before."
