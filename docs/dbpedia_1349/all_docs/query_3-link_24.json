        "text": "Text: Hosea 6:3, Lamentations 3:22-24\n\n“Let us acknowledge the Lord; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.”\n\n-Hosea 6:3\n\nTruth be told, I am a worrier in progress.\n\nI know I’m not supposed to worry. I know God calls us to trust Him and tells us He will carry our burdens (Matthew 11:28). But if I’m honest, a lot of days it feels easier to worry than to trust.\n\nI guess worrying gives me the illusion of control. I’ll lay in bed at night mulling questions or scenarios over in my mind: What if…? How will I ever…? What if I never…? And if I don’t have something to worry about today, I’ll often borrow worry from tomorrow. It’s a problem God is continually addressing in my life.\n\nBut there is one thing I never fall asleep at night worrying about, and that’s whether or not the sun’s going to come up in the morning. It’s a sure bet. And God promises that with each morning sunrise, He offers mercies anew and love unfailing (Lamentations 3:22-23). That, too, is a sure thing, yet I doubt it all the time.\n\nI am so grateful that God wrote His promises in the sky. He knew we would forget His love and His mercy and His faithfulness. So every morning, He instructs the sun to sing out a chorus of undeserved and unending love, a song of mercies anew.\n\nI love God’s promise in Hosea is that “He will appear” (Hosea 6:3). He doesn’t promise a problem-free life, or a life without suffering. He doesn’t say, “As surely as the sun rises, life will be easy and you will never struggle.” I’m so glad that’s not the promise He gives us because it wouldn’t ring true.\n\nWe all know this life doesn’t come without struggle and disappointment and hurt (John 16:33). We’ve all got unanswered questions and unspoken fears. The beauty of these verses to me is that God promises His presence. He promises that no matter what we are walking through, He will show up and He will be there with us.\n\nWhat are you worried about today, sisters? I’m praying that as we lift our eyes to the sky, we’d see evidence of God’s promised presence in our lives. Even on the days we can’t feel His presence, may we always know He’s there… as surely as the sun that rises each morning.\n\nAs Sure As The Sun\n\nby Ellie Holcomb\n\nThere is good news\n\nThere is good truth\n\nThat you could never change\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nYou are loved\n\nMore than you know\n\nMore than you could hope for\n\nAfter everything you’ve done\n\nAs sure as the sun will rise\n\nAnd takes away the night\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nThere is good news\n\nThere’s a promise\n\nThat no matter where you go\n\nYou will never be alone\n\nIn the dark\n\nIn the doubting\n\nWhen you can’t feel anything\n\nOh, his love remains the same\n\nAs sure as the sun will rise\n\nAnd takes away the night\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nHis mercy will not end\n\nEven through the night\n\nSilver stars will shine\n\nHope of glory’s light\n\nThat will wake us once again"
