        "text": "Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII\n\nDeveloper – Square Enix, tri-Ace\n\nPublisher – Square Enix\n\nYear – 2013\n\nPlayers – 1\n\nSystems – Playstation 3, X-Box 360, PC\n\nhttps://whatsyourtagblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lrlogo.jp\n\nFinal Fantasy. Arguably one of the most popular and successful RPG series of all time. The games have ranged from amazing to good to mediocre to terrible. The PS3’s first FF game was Final Fantasy XIII and it was highly anticipated, but ultimately didn’t deliver, being hugely linear and mediocre. For some reason, Square Enix decided we all wanted a sequel to it and thus a couple years later we got Final Fantasy XIII-2. This game wasn’t linear at all, but was too non-linear for its own good and added confusing time travel nonsense along with forcing players to pay for the Disc Locked Content ending. XIII-2 wasn’t wanted or needed. And now we have a *second* sequel titled Lightning Returns. And why? I don’t know, I guess Square Enix felt we all desperately wanted a further sequel to one of the most mediocre FF’s of all time.\n\nThat’s the thing though, FFXIII had an ending; the game was done, the story was concluded. The second one definitely felt forced and had a horribly lacklustre ending during which the words “TO BE CONTINUED” flashed on screen making thousands of gamers roll their eyes and go “Oh here we go, there’s gonna be another sequel…” No FF game (to my knowledge at least) has ever had ‘To Be Continued’ plastered onto its ending before and it just screams Cash Grab. And to be honest, I’m getting a little tired of the fact that Square Enix keep on shoving the character of Lightning down our throats; okay guys okay, we get it, she’s your current poster character. It wouldn’t be so bad if these characters weren’t so 2 dimensional. Lemme put it this way; the characters of the XIII games LOOK interesting, but they AREN’T interesting characters, you follow?\n\nSo is the 3rd XIII game any good? Let’s find out.\n\nThis time round Lightning is going by the title of The Saviour and is serving under God (a.k.a. Buhnivelze, pronounced Bun-Ee-Vel-Za) after he frees her from her crystal stasis after 500 years. Light’s mission is to save souls and lead them to a new world which Buhn- sod it, which God will create after the world ends in 13 days. Along for the ride is Hope who is now for some reason a 14 year old boy again. It’s handwaved by saying God did it. Literally.\n\nSo let’s recap what we have so far; yet another sequel to a game nobody really liked with a cliché title and a plot involving Lightning now suddenly being the servant of God whilst Hope helps out after de-aging several years. Right… Let’s uh… let’s get down to business.\n\nFirst up, the graphics. Overall the game does look like one of the better ones in recent years, but it’s plagued by those jaggedy animation skips during cutscenes that were present in the first 2 games. Character models look good with constantly flowing hair and clothing so no complaints there. Square have also done their tested and true method of matching the lip flaps to the English dialogue, a nice touch that worked well with other localised Square titles such as Advent Children. The locales look great, with both towns of Yusnaan and Luxerion being highly detailed with constant activity from the townsfolk. The game also has day and night transitions to spice things up and the special effects during battle look nice, if maybe a little over the top, but the Chaos area effects look very dated and bland. The enemy designs are varied and still have that unique Final Fantasy feel to them. The game does look very pretty, but seeing as how this is the third game in this series, I expected a little more.\n\nOne thing I will say however is that the FMVs look GORGEOUS. In fact they look so good that it really does look like real people acting in a film or something. The CGI scenes are stunning and remind me of why I love FMV cutscenes so much. It’s a pity there weren’t more of them.\n\nAs for the sound, I’ll wholeheartedly admit that I really like many of the songs in this trilogy. I don’t know what it is about them, but they are highly atmospheric and tranquil. The music is easily LR’s best feature in my eyes.\n\nThe voice acting however is just as bland as the first two games. You know the deal; it’s all the same ruddy voice actors that are in everything nowadays. Ali Hillis again voices Lightning making her sound extremely bored, like she just doesn’t want to voice this character anymore. I mean I get that Light is of the ‘dark silent brooding’ archetype, but still. There is an option to get Japanese voice actors however, but it’s DLC. Free DLC, but still DLC and as a result I didn’t bother using up more hard drive space just to get Japanese seiyuu.\n\nBut the sound is also where one of my (and tons of other people’s) major criticisms stem from. Hope. Hope Estheim. Basically, Hope is able to talk to you no matter where you are, constantly telling you what to do and where to go. Sounds good right? Wrong. The little asshole just. Won’t. Stop. Talking. I mean it, he never shuts up, he drones on and on and on. And the things he says are so obvious and unnecessary. Take the firework gathering side quest; after each firework I obtained, the kid told me exactly how many I needed, *every single time*. Light must return to the hub known as the Arc at 6:00am everyday (more on that later) and during the last hour, Hope will tell you around 4 to 5 times that it’s almost 6 and will then go into great detail about how you absolutely have to return no matter what. He often repeats what others have said, over-explaining it like you’re some sort of idiot with a below average attention span. He talks so much that he’s 95% of the time cut off due to you engaging in a battle. Most of the time I found myself running up to a monster to start a fight with it JUST to shut Hope up. Forget Navi, Hope is the ultimate annoying sidekick and by the end of the game you’ll be screaming at the TV, begging for him to shut his trap.\n\nAs for the gameplay, SE have revamped the entire system, making it effectively a hybrid of Crisis Core, FFXII and Kingdom Hearts’ gameplay. During battle Light can switch between 3 outfits known as Schemata or Garb. Each Schemata can be customised with up to 4 moves such as Attack, Thunder, Mediguard, etc. The ATB constantly, but slowly rises during the battle and I saw this to be somewhat of a problem during harder boss battles where I found myself waiting for the bars to fill up enough so I could use a move before waiting again. As just mentioned Light has a shedload of different costumes to equip, each with their own special stats and a fixed ability that you can’t un-equip. Loads of these outfits are simply palette swaps however which is a bit of a letdown.\n\nIn a twist, our saviour can also equip iconic costumes of a few other Final Fantasy characters; Cloud’s FFVII clothing, Aeris’s pink dress and red jacket, Yuna’s X and X-2 outfits are all available. Providing you are willing to shell out for them of course. Yes, loads of Garb are sadly DLC. One thing that puzzles me are the choices, I mean Light is basically a female clone of Cloud so his outfit I can see why it was added, but why Aeris and Yuna? Lightning is not like those characters at all. I’m betting she only has Aeris’ outfit because both characters share the same Japanese voice actress. Why not Advent Children Cloud, Squall’s leather ensemble, Paine’s default Dress sphere, Auron’s red haori? Light also has another borrowed costume, Lara Croft’s; only it’s the outfit from the reboot (a game I wasn’t fond of) and not the iconic green tank top with brown shorts and boots look. If you have save data from the first two games then you’ll be able to equip Light’s outfits and weapons from those games as well.\n\nAll in all it’s nice to see a lot of customization potential, but the same 3 outfits were more than sufficient to get me through the entire game. 97% of the others all remained hung up in the wardrobe.\n\nWith this game, Square made the huge mistake of doing away with EXP and levelling. Instead of receiving experience from monsters in order to level up to improve your stats, Light is now forced to undertake pointless side quests scattered throughout the world. Completion of a side quest will give you a minimal boost to your stats. This makes improving your strength, magic, HP and more extremely tedious. Most of the time me and Light were running around giving items to people and it was hugely unsatisfying. As someone who doesn’t mind grinding at all and actually quite enjoys it, yet hates side quests this was extremely jarring and hampered my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, Square took the “The world’s ending in a few days” thing literally and players are unfairly hampered by a continuous time limit which is always ticking down. Each in game minute is the equivalent of 3 real time seconds so the days can end up going by very quickly when you’ve undertaken several side quests. Early on you’ll unlock an ability known as Chronostasis which freezes the timer for a short while. Thing is, you’ll constantly find yourself re-activating it and running out of EP which is the energy needed to utilise Chronostasis as well as other abilities such as teleportation and Curaga.\n\nThe time limit was a gigantic **** up on the part of Square Enix who lousily tried to justify it by saying they wanted players to feel like they were constantly on the move. On top of all that, certain side quests can only be completed during certain times and I found myself constantly having to wait or skip a day entirely just to finish them. Along with Hope’s endless jabbering, the time limit is the game’s biggest problem. I mean, what’s the point in giving us such a massive world to explore if you’re not gonna let us explore it?\n\nAs for the Lifespan, well, let’s take a look shall we? The main story takes a little while to finish providing you take on as many side quests as you can. Completing side quests gives you what’s known as Eradia which you can use on the tree Yggdrasil back in the Arc to extent the game up to 14 days. If you don’t complete enough of the main story, you can simply fast forward to the end and start again with New Game Plus. NG+ allows you to begin the game just after the prologue with all your stats, items, moves, most Garb, weapons and shields. You lose your main and side quest progress though which makes sense because you wouldn’t be able to improve Light’s stats otherwise. As you progress, you’ll be able to buy (using in game currency, not real money) more Garb and stuff thus allowing you to do more customizing if you like that sort of thing.\n\nBut wait, what about the ending? Was it good? Did it tie up all lose ends? Was it worth it?? Honestly no. The ending was extremely boring, felt rushed and left me with a deep feeling of emptiness. Not like when I first viewed the ending to FFX, now THAT ending was worth it!\n\nOverall I really didn’t enjoy this game. I’ve tried to like this trilogy I really have, but it just has far too many faults. Let’s hope that SE don’t decide to make yet another sequel eh? Although, with Final Fantasy XV being set in the same universe, I wouldn’t be surprised if Noctis and the gang meet up with Lightning at some point…\n\n*Blip blip* “Hey Nikku! I know a long boring story about Noctis! Allow me to fill you in……………!”\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nGraphics – 8/10\n\nThe game looks way above average, but the graphics could’ve been better. The FMV’s are practically flawless however.\n\nSound – 4/10\n\nBeautiful music is hampered by lousy voice acting and Hope’s constant talking.\n\nGameplay – 2/10\n\nAn okay battle system rests upon a very restricting time limit that’s always ticking down. No levelling and only getting minimal stat boosts from tedious side quests make this a letdown.\n\nLifespan – 5/10\n\nThere was a little potential, but overall the game falls flat. New Game Plus can help alleviate the boredom a little, but not by much.\n\nOverall =\n\n“Meow Meow Choco Chow…” 14/40\n\n(Minus 5 points for DLC)"
