        "text": "I recall when I was working on a land survey crew in the bush, and we had a young guy from Hong Kong working with us. He was so nervous about all the scary things in the bush and stepping off the trail for any reason was an opportunity to get totally lost, His personal space couldn’t have been more than one foot and he was mystified at these seasoned Canadian bushwackers who seemed to fear nothing. Imagine his dismay when the crew stumbled upon a harmless looking papery nest on a low branch, and ran past him in apparent terror! Those up-til-then fearless bushmen had learned that the best way to deal with disturbed hornets was to flee.\n\nHaving claimed to deliver us from superstition, religious hang-ups, oppressive monarchies, and arbitrary stifling rules, our brave new world is hoping to complete the exercise by removing phobias, and all relics of our Judeo-Christian heritage. Add the suffix “phobe” to whatever someone else finds objectionable, and you somehow expose them as joy-killing enemies of the people. The notion that inhibitions bring grief while license brings happiness permeates popular assumption. “No Fear” is the motto, and “hands on” is the way to learn.\n\nBut with the disturbed hornet’s nest image in our minds, harmless appearing to the uninitiated, while reason for even the brave to flee, we could sensibly consider if there might be other hornet’s nests which might be better avoided by instruction rather than by “hands on”. With all of Scriptures challenges to “fear not”, there are a few things which we are advised to flee (like that hornet’s nest), not because some phobic old kill-joy made up a rule, but because it is smart. These are sexual immorality (1Cor.6:18), idolatry (1Cor.10:14), wanting to get rich (1Tim.6:9-11), and evil desires of youth (2Tim. 2:22). Let’s look at these in the order they appear in Scipture, and then consider our topic of the “evil desires of youth.”\n\nSexual immorality (1Cor.6:18) The context is regarding divisions and problems in the Corinthian church, specifically addressing greedily taking each other to court, and listing the kinds of things that disqualify people from an inheritance in God’s kingdom, noting that neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 1Co 6:9-10 ESV The passage goes on to say that although we are not under law, not all things are helpful, and as servants and members of Christ’s body, we are not our own and not to be dominated by anything other than Christ. Corinthian culture liked the mantra that “all things are lawful for me” and since our bodies are natural, then our natural appetites must be OK too. Greek philosophers viewed the real person as being the mind, and the body only as a necessary temporary vessel for it. But the Lord places high value on our bodies, referring to them as temples of His Spirit, bringing glory to Him. We are united with Him in spirit as a whole person, just as a husband and wife are united. Sex unites us with another person, body, mind, emotion, and spirit.\n\nThe world assumes that being a follower of Jesus is all about arbitrary rules that stifle our humanity. The good news is all about how although we are already stifled and enslaved by the kind of things listed here, following Jesus frees us from them. And we are reminded in this passage that when we have received Jesus’ gift of liberty, which He purchased with His own human life, our bodies have become God’s temple and we are not our own. We never were really independently self-actualized; we were servants of sin and now we can be servants of God. So in this context, we are challenged to flee from sexual immorality as a sin against our own body. We hear much these days about abuse, which means misuse. We can easily see how misusing things, although appealing for the short term, eventually wrecks things, such as regularly using a half-ton to carry a whole ton, or using a table knife as a screwdriver. Similarly when we take what God designed for a perfect means of personal fulfillment, producing and raising the next generation, and energizing those around us, and misuse it by slavishly seeking to get turned on, we miss out on personal fulfillment, and are a drain to those around us as well as the next generation. God’s ideal instructions for use of our sexuality for best results is lifelong intimacy between one man and one woman. Other uses bring various results, but not as good. Our culture is trying to convince us that almost any use of it is just as good, which is resulting in an ever-growing confusion of rules to try to prevent the kind of things from which God’s way offered to free us.\n\nIdolatry: 1Cor.10 uses the example of Israel in the wilderness, fearful of lacking basic needs of food, shelter, security, comfort and pleasure. They made these things their ultimate priority, and constructed an idol representing them as the focal point to just “let it go”, and let their inner drives and feelings lead them, which sounds like common advice today. This passage simply says that “They sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.” As with sexuality, this was just following naturally created urges, not wrong in themselves, but making it a challenge to not be mastered by any of them. To the Corinthians, idolatry was feasting in pagan temples, which Paul identified as being participants with demons.1Cor.10:20 To us it might be longing for what a materialist economy brings, typified as Babylon in Scripture.\n\nBut just as these natural drives are common to mankind, God will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.1Cor.10:13 Despite looking harmless enough, passionate cravings led to tragedy then, as they do now, and we are warned therefore to flee from idolatry.1Cor.10:14 It is not actually the symbolic statue that people worship, nor even the spirit they think it portrays, but rather the stuff and pleasure they hope it will bring or the bad things they hope it will keep away. Similarly, fans who idolize celebrities love the entertainment they provide rather than the celebrities themselves. Jesus taught that our Father in heaven knows we need food and shelter, and delights in providing that and so much more, just as earthly parents delight in giving gifts to their children. But also like earthly parents or lovers, God invites us to know and love him rather than merely the gifts.\n\nWanting to get rich (1Tim.6:9-11) In the context of how to get along well with each other, Paul makes special mention of the alluring fantasy of being wealthy, giving the alternative of learning contentment, which is the opposite of a passion to be rich. Like “prosperity gospel” today, teachers then were presenting the Christian life as a means for getting rich. While God’s instructions for best use of our time here include the pursuit of righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness and gentleness, the pursuit of getting rich leads to many senseless and harmful “passions” that plunge people into ruin and pain. Again, God’s simple command is to free us and protect us from misery. Again the wisdom of the world, often in indirect ways by portraying how happy and carefree we would be if we had material wealth, encourages us to go for it. God says, “Flee”, not because of the need to comply with arbitrary religious codes, but because, like the hornet’s nest, these things don’t look dangerous, but carry a very mean bite and are very difficult to extract ourselves from once we foolishly wade into them.\n\nSo we get to 2Tim.2:22: “Flee the evil desires of youth.”\n\nWhat are the “evil desires of youth” (youthful passions ESV) and what makes them worthy of special mention? Since whatever happens to us as we are growing up is the only growing up we’ve ever had, whatever that was is normal to us. As babies we are equipped with desires for comfort and pleasure, and we learn as we grow how to experience some measure of these. We learn quite naively at first, and it might not be ‘til years later that we are brought to question the right or wrong of it. Mistreating or misleading children is recognized both by the world and in Scripture as a crime of double seriousness because they are not able to understand that what is being done is wrong, nor could they withstand it if they did.\n\nWe could fairly classify these sins as in 1Jn.2:16 as our natural physical desires for comfort, the desire to acquire more power and possessions, and the desire for recognition and admiration of others, pleasures, power and possessions, and popularity if you like alliterations. For all that is in the world– the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life– is not from the Father but is from the world. (1Jo 2:16 ESV)\n\nConsidering my own formational years, it would also be fair to say that these three types of desires were normalized for me. That is, rather than seeing these as “youthful lusts” to flee, they were actually worthy goals to aspire for. I was taught that if I worked hard and skilfully, it would make things comfortable around me, and I could enjoy food and pleasures. If I delayed rewards, and applied myself to education, and more work, I could have not only the necessities, but also the extra possessions that make life more interesting, as well as the freedom to do what I pleased and have influence over others. And if I do all of that well enough, and behave myself reasonably, then others will think well of me. All of that sounds quite sensible, and it is largely how society works. But just like the Israelites, who “sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play,” we very naturally begin to idolize those pleasurable pursuits as the passage in 1Cor.10 says. And so the other things mentioned in the references above, sexual pleasure, food and drink, comforts, wealth, influence, respect and admiration of others, which all seem desirable as God’s good gifts, can easily displace God as the object of our worship, and become the “evil desires of youth”.\n\nWhat makes some things “evil” then? The wisdom of the world continues to try to convince us that “sin” is only a contrivance of religious control freaks who want to manipulate and exploit gullible people with the belief that they are sinners needing the absolution offered by that religion. In the same breath of course, that worldly wisdom lays upon us an ever-growing burden of “sin” defined by its own terms, whether they are sins against the visible minority of the day, or the environment, or humanity, or being unloving or intolerant. They claim bonus points if they can attribute those “sins” to religion in general, or the God of the Bible in particular. But just as Adam and Eve knew when they had missed the mark, so when we know what is right and do something different, it sin, or evil. Every sin is a good thing gone awry. Every evil is something that God has created as a perfect expression of Himself that has been twisted to oppose Him. It is an act or attitude that contradicts the character of God.\n\nSo with this understanding, the best way to recognize sin is not so much memorizing lists of them, but rather becoming more acquainted both in thought and practice with the person of God. It is OK to be reminded of the “seven deadly sins” over and against the “cardinal virtues”, just as Scripture often puts up a list of examples of the former in contrast to the latter. But the point is not so much to smugly imagine we have avoided all the sins, but to understand the meaning of the common final point of the lists: “and things like that.” Sin is evil because it is all that leads us away from God, and to death. Following God’s character leads to God and to life. This is not hard to understand, but it is only when we apply ourselves to do it that we begin to recognize the war in our natural selves against God.\n\nWhy the command to “flee” in these instances, sexual immorality, idolatry, wanting to get rich, and passions of youth, compared to just don’t do it in others? Possibly it is because these are all so difficult to see as sinful in ourselves. They are slippery to define. Thinking of some of the Ten Commandments seems straight forward, don’t worship graven images, don’t steal or kill or commit adultery. We can add on many specific rules about clothing we should or shouldn’t wear, words we shouldn’t say, music we shouldn’t listen to, entertainment we shouldn’t participate in, and so on. But at what point does my sexuality become “immoral”, or my appreciation of something become idolatrous, or my natural ability to be creative, work, and provide for myself and family become an evil coveting after wealth? When do the cultural practices that seemed normal as a child or enjoyment of pleasure, possessions and popularity become exposed as youthful lusts? They feel normal, because for us they are normal. These are examples of the sin which so easily entangles us.Heb.12:1 NAS\n\nA few years ago, Brett Wilson, the nice “dragon” on Dragon’s Den, published Redefining Success: Still Making Mistakes (2012). (I only read the newspaper interview.) He defined those mistakes as, “Inattention to family, work addiction and a preoccupation with material goods — the sorts of challenges that many other business leaders face, whether they would admit it or not.” He described how a materially very successful person can slip into behaviours and results that he really didn’t actually plan on. Similarly when we just carry on with what presents itself without intentionally checking where that is leading, eventually a moral or family or financial or health crisis can rudely alert us to where we’ve gotten ourselves. Like the unexpected hornet’s nest, it is good to flee some things before they are all over us.\n\nIs it wrong then to be “passionate”, or maybe just for young people to be passionate? Some translations render our text as “youthful lusts” but it could equally be “passions” or “desires”. Does the Bible teach us to put aside all passions? The word for “passion” means to “keep the heat on”, and might be translated as lust, desire, craving, longing, coveting. There are many references to “passion” in Scripture. In the positive sense we see Jesus passionate to have the last supper with His disciples, or Paul passionately desiring to meet with the Christians in Thessalonika, or to leave this world and be with the Lord. But for the most part, whether there is a qualifier such as passions of the world, of the flesh, of the self, for specific sins or sin in general, or no qualifier at all such as “You shall not covet,” passions get us into trouble. Paul explained that the commandment to not covet made him aware of his own passionate desires.Rom.7:7\n\nWhat about the youthful part? The word for youthful is used only in this passage, but judging by the other references to passions, we could understand this as a warning to Timothy as a young church leader not to be driven by childish urges, such as “impatience, intolerance, love of argument, self-assertion, partiality” (The Bible Knowledge Commentary). Here would be another example of Scripture holding about a 180 from popular myth which likes to pretend that going with your feelings is best, and that kids are usually right. While we might justify our own behaviour with that motto, we don’t generally appreciate it in the person next to us.\n\nHow do we “flee”? If these evil desires of youth are so ordinary and all around us, when and to where do we run? Drawing again from the hornet’s nest, we fled as soon as we recognized both what we were facing and that we were not going to convert the hornets. From Scripture, Joseph comes to mind as he physically fled when propositioned for sexual immorality by Potiphar’s wife. King Hezekiah broke up the bronze serpent that God had instructed Moses to make, because the people were making offerings to it.2Ki.18:4 Jesus walked away when the people started talking about making him king. Peter refused payment when Simon the magician offered him money. The Lord Jesus was presented with opportunity for pleasure (bread from stones), possessions and power (the kingdoms of the world), and popularity (perform a spectacular feat), but identified each one for what it was, responded with what Scripture had to say about it and rejected it.\n\nThat would be a useful approach then for us. Although our friend from Hong Kong could not know the danger of a hornet’s nest, we could name it for what it was and take evasive action. (We did not quote Scripture nor pray in that situation however.)\n\nWhen we recognize sexual immorality in person, on a screen, or on a page, we are similarly free to name it for what it is and turn away, or turn it off, or turn the page. We are reminded to glorify God in your body1Cor.6:20.\n\nWhen we recognize that our conversation has slid to promotion of self or tearing down of others, we are free to change the subject or talk to someone else or leave. We are reminded to let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.1Cor.10:24\n\nWhen we recognize that we are getting more interested in acquiring money and stuff (as evidenced by lingering in catalogues or malls, or drooling over someone else’s truck or boat, or working to the detriment of our health and family so we can move up a rung on the social ladder, or getting pre-occupied with the stock market or get-rich-quick schemes) than in appreciating people and things as God’s good gifts, we are free to use our time and possessions to bless someone else that cannot repay us, or to enjoy friends and family and God’s creation without expensive trips and toys. We are reminded to set our hopes on God, who richly provides us everything to enjoy… to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, thus storing up treasure… for the future.!Tim.6:17-19\n\nWhen we recognize that our thoughts and actions are being more driven by self-centered urges than by God’s Spirit, we are free to use that same energy and time to intentionally thank and praise God for His good gifts, or use the activity to bless others or set it aside for a while at least. Flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace.1Tim.6:22 In each instance, we see something for what it is in light of what God has said, and if it contradicts God’s perfect person and character, we can learn to find it distasteful rather than alluring.\n\nGood News! So what does the Gospel of grace have to do with all this? To echo Paul’s words in Romans, Much in every way, chiefly that we often already know what to do, but don’t do it. At some level, we want to get caught up in diversions that offer to gratify our natural desires, even when we have an inkling that it probably isn’t the best thing to do. We need to continually be reminded that it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. (Phi 2:13 ESV) As we purpose to set ourselves on track to follow Jesus, practicing loving what He loves, and hating what He hates, we are quicker to recognize a hornet’s nest when we see one. We learn not to keep going until we get stung. We can even learn to get a sense that there is a high likelihood of there being one before we see it. Just as we develop appetites as very young children for what kind of food is appealing to us, the Spirit of God changes our appetites as we practice filtering everything in comparison to Him. So He works in us to know and to will for His good pleasure.\n\nHe also works in us to do. Even though that same Spirit of God is resident in every follower of Jesus, we can grieve that Spirit by trying to shut Him down as we excuse ourselves for lingering when we should be fleeing. Will power is great. Some have more and some less, regardless of what they think of Jesus. But doing God’s good pleasure is more about growing to love Him than it is about steeling our wills to do the right thing.\n\nFinally the Gospel has everything to do with it because when we know that we are clean and whole in our relationship with God, the desire and ability to work for his good pleasure are so much more naturally accessible. When we feel that we are a total mess anyway, what difference does it make if we just linger a little longer in the catalogue or the mall or the conversation or the internet site or the television show or the food or drink? So we also need to be continually reminded that, If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1Jo 1:9 ESV). Name the passion of youth for what it is, whether first noticing it, half way into it, or recognizing after the fact. That is confessing. And don’t just confess that we slipped up in a particular action, but actually name that inner motive, appetite or desire that drew us into it, which we still cherish in our hearts even though we don’t like the consequences of our actions. Then remind yourself of what you already know, that following Jesus is better than that.\n\nWe will have opportunity to put this counsel into practice, this week if not today. May we be a people who are not so much stressed with getting caught committing a no-no, but rather who flee those things that lead to death, and learn to delight ourselves in the living God. As we say in our church covenant, so that in everything Christ might be seen as the supreme treasure of our lives and God be glorified."
