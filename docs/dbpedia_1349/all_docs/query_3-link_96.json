        "text": "**Spoiler Alert[Final Fantasy titles]**\n\nControversies over video game content have always been part of various political discourses around the world. Despite the video game industry being marginalized thoroughly because of it being usually dismissed as ‘senseless, escapist entertainment’, it cannot be denied that it is by itself, a medium for freedom of expression. Because of the video game’s expressive nature of it’s heterogeneous content, it has the tendency to either positively or negatively impact the player’s attitude and behavior.\n\nThrough manipulations of complex computer code and algorithms, programmers are able to literally create a whole, new world[no matter how virtual] for us to interact with and for us to immerse on. Games will only be just ‘senseless entertainment’ if its ‘interactivity’ dimension relies on it being a combination of unique ‘play’ mechanics. However, video game worlds have transformed into such that they have their own characters, their own issues and their own values and beliefs that support the game for it to feel ‘alive’.\n\nSuch is the evolution of the Final Fantasy franchise. The game is now more than just a combination of strings and codes. It has a story to tell, it has a world to show, and it needs us to sit down for an hour or two and live with it for it to be told.\n\nWith its release of Final Fantasy XIII, XIV and eventually XV, the gaming franchise yet again adds to their own collection of interactively telling the best ‘fantasy’ stories in video gaming history. The Final Fantasy gaming franchise is my personal favorite, with Final Fantasy 8 being the best one, in my opinion. I do not know what it is about Final Fantasy when I played it for the first time when I was in my pre-puberty years that hooked up my interest. I mean, there are a lot of games floating in the same, story-telling fantasy genre. Despite it following a staple, Japanese role-playing game formula: battle system, character progression, exploration, etc., Final Fantasy has its own unique way of getting you immersed into the story.\n\nGoing back to what I said about video games as a medium for expression, the Final Fantasy games immortalizes the ‘expression’ that makes up the conflict of the story of the game. There are two bases for the game to tell its story: First, the game’s engaging story is based on a protagonistic-antagonistic relationship between two sides of the forces: obviously the good side and the bad side. Second, the rationality of a need for a battle system[built from the first base]: wherein you have to fight your way through a series of challenges to beat the game. Now, reading this, the formula may look simple, but what makes the game appealing is how the issues are tackled, one at a time. Most of the time, the Final Fantasy franchise tackles economic, cultural, political and social issues through the battling of repressive faith.\n\nIn Final Fantasy X, the storyline mainly revolves around how a set of people are radically fighting against the traditional, oppressive God that nobody has questioned, until now. With a few close-reading of the game, it may seem as if Final Fantasy X is against organized religion. Though I do not know if this is the message that the programmers are wanting to convey, but this is the working conflict that makes the storyline dramatic and alive. The game’s cultural beliefs is that the ‘Church’ in the game[in the form of an entity named Yevon], tells the people to blindly follow its teachings for a separate, destructive entity, named Sin, to be destroyed for good. Yevon, or the ‘Church’, gives false hope though, as Sin cannot be defeated entirely and that it requires something else for this destructive entity to be gone for good.\n\nMost of the other Final Fantasy titles I have played also had a recurring theme of antagonists. Final Fantasy games also questions the idea of religious fanaticism and faith, such as in Tactics, wherein the main characters seem to be fighting a ‘mirrored’ image of the Roman Catholic church which dwells on corruption. The same can be said for Final Fantasy XIII, as the main characters were fighting against the political leaders in the game, the Sanctum, or in other words, the Church-turned-civilian guards.\n\nSuch issues are tackled with radicalism. Characters along the genre develop through rebellion against a certain oppressive entity. Technically, the game portrays you as the protagonists, but within the contexts of the game, the characters that you control are the antagonists of the system’s norms. In Final Fantasy X, the main protagonists of the game are generally branded as heretics. The culture that we players get introduced into is built upon a social structure that merits technical ability more than religious and spiritual devotion. Only then will we travel the religiously oppressed yet blinded world of Spira after a few cutscenes here and there and a bit of gameplay and storyline progression. As such, radicalism from this group is more or less being frowned upon. The same can be said for Final Fantasy XIII, as despite their noble intentions of bringing down the unsuspectingly oppressive hierarchy of religious leaders, they are still branded as the ‘bad guys’ in the game.\n\nSuch is the beauty of the genre[for me]. They involve us deeply into the hearts of their problems that no other game can do. Yes, it has its own flaws and the game is obviously not perfect. But still, the game has its own unique presentation of how the different forces and stances in the game collaboratively work against one another. We get immersed into such a fantasy that even the problem of buying an potion for a virtually sick man or the collecting of virtual wooden branches becomes our own problems. What more of bigger issues? The presentation of the game’s overall economic, political, social and cultural issues comes from an antagonistic relationship with the game’s dominating hierarchy, which is most of the time, the religious-turned-political leaders.\n\nNow what does this game tell to us players? Is it about always rebelling when we see something wrong or is it about fighting for something that is right? Is it suggesting that we should all turn to atheism and turn away from religious corruption? The game is an immortalization of such an idea. Nevertheless, it is still up to the player’s whether to pick up the idea or not. The medium as an expression of such an idea is only as strong as the player’s receptiveness of such an idea. I say that the Final Fantasy games that I have played did really present such an idea, yet this immersion into such an issue-full storyline experience helped me more positively than negatively. Rather than picking up the ‘negative’ aspects of the game, why not pick up the glints of hope that it rather suggests? It is a worthy gaming experience that I say, all titles must be given a chance and be tried at least once.\n\nListen to this after reading: *VICTORY MUSIC*\n\n——————————————————————————————————————————\n\nSupporting sources: * In-game dialogue copied from http://www.ffwa.org/ff10/script.php?page=p3-04\n\nYunalesca\n\n“Sin is an inevitable part of Spira’s destiny.
