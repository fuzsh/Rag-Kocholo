        "text": "well, maybe X and X-2 were more his style. nothing wrong with that\n\nFFX had a moving story, and cool characters\n\nFFx-2 had scantily clad girls whats not to love\n\nwhere as FF7 is the PRime example of an EMo game\n\nMaybe so. I mean FF7 love story was annoying but atleast they didn't have a terrible fucking one like 10. I never laughed so hard when i saw that kissing scene under water. Oh man that shit was TOOO funny.\n\nhow exactly was that scen funny?\n\nFF7 a emo game? How old are you...\n\nAnd what's not to love about 10-2? Is that a serious question. Just about everything in that game sucked and If you get off on CGI models...well...yeah...\n\n20 how old are u?\n\ni kept expectign cloud to start cuttign him self with his oversized sword lol\n\nas for X-2 , i liked the characters, the designs, the music, and the the Job change system which was really cool and left room for alot of growth,\n\nalso the plot wasnt intirly bad, i liked the warring factions, and the depictions of a world in recovery\n\n20 how old are u?\n\ni kept expectign cloud to start cuttign him self with his oversized sword lol\n\nas for X-2 , i liked the characters, the designs, the music, and the the Job change system which was really cool and left room for alot of growth,\n\nalso the plot wasnt intirly bad, i liked the warring factions, and the depictions of a world in recovery\n\n19\n\nCloud wasn't the greatest character. I didn't love his personality but i understood he's basically a solider who has to do his duty. Meh it wasn't anything exciting. It was more the other characters i liked except Vincent, i hate that mother fucker. Also the end of the world thing was presented better in 7 for me then 10, except the ending. 7's was almost as bad as 10's. Actually most FF suck at endings it seems.\n\n10-2's story was by far the worst IMO. It was just so fucking boring. The only good quality in 10-2 was basically the battle system, was fun to use. but man did the story suck and barely add anything to 10.\n\nBut on the point of FF7 being emo, no. None of the final fantasy games have emo characters, not even close. If cloud was emo he'd be crying in a corner and can't lift up a finger from all the blood lose of cutting himself. cloud was a solider, a quite one who didn't talk much but he was a solider. Back then alot of MC and even today are the silent type. Cloud was far from emo, none of the final fantasy characters were...not yet anyway.\n\n19\n\nCloud wasn't the greatest character.

I mean FF7 love story was annoying but atleast they didn't have a terrible fucking one like 10. I never laughed so hard when i saw that kissing scene under water. Oh man that shit was TOOO funny.\n\nI didn't find it funny, I found it forced.\n\nHow people thought that such a plot element was strong at a love level is beyond me.\n\nSquall \"whatever\" and Rinoa had a better love story in VIII, and that was forced as shit, too.\n\nI didn't find it funny, I found it forced.\n\nHow people thought that such a plot element was strong at a love level is beyond me.\n\nSquall \"whatever\" and Rinoa had a better love story in VIII, and that was forced as shit, too.\n\ni wouldnt say Tidus and Yuna wer \"in love\" at that point , their was attraction, nad she had been thru a helll of a lot, [Findign out her religon is a lie, Symour forcing him self on her, being alinated by the people, plus the stress of sacrificng her self] and he wanted to comfert her\n\ncloud not emo have u seen advents children , hes soo emo he spends half to movie mopeing aboud how he thinks hes usless , and cant help any one even thogh he saved the fucking world\n\nas far as FF X-2 it adds alot to FFX, it gives it a more definitve endign, it adds more to the back story, and like i said depicts the Spira's recovery\n\nYeah because having a disease that'll kill you doesn't make you all fucked up. And he spends 25 minutes saying he can't help because he couldn't even save the girl he loved. He couldn't save his best friend. He's dying on top of that. He doesn't have much motive to do things cause there's nothing he could do at this point but he knows when it's time to fight and that's why he whooped ass in the end.\n\nI'll take a hero who doesn't talk much and only fights over a goofy and gay looking hero *No offense to gays, but tidus looks like about as mainly as clay akin.*\n\nYeah because having a disease that'll kill you doesn't make you all fucked up.

Cloud remains a solider throughout the game and the movie. He does the mission he's told, simple as that. To keep the ones he likes safe he'll fight, nothing more or less. That's not emo, you're now sounding like a idiot.\n\nAnd cloud -\n\nDoes not look as gay as tidus nor does he have the gay personality of tidus *And thank the fucking invisible guy up there*\n\nIt bugs me when people call a character emo whenever that character shows emotions.\n\nCloud was guilty over his friend's deaths, wouldn't you feel the same if you thought your friend died because of you?\n\nI've even seen people bash Vaan, when Vaan had the right to be \"emo\" (he was looking at the man who killed (at least, he thought he did) his brother for fuck sake).\n\nAll of them are great characters so stop with this emo stuff.\n\nCloud did seem overly depressed in AC compared to FF7, I personally disliked it since it seemed very different compared to how he ended in FF7.\n\nSaying Cloud is in emo in FF7 is pretty idiotic, and shows that some people really exaggerate or don't pay attention to the game they play. A majority of the game he goes on acting fairly normal, and he actually talks a decent amount(another thing people exaggerate about). He finds out the truth then breaks down(understandable in his position imo), which gets resolved after a little while. Once that is resolved he acts pretty normal again.Anyways enough about FF7 and Cloud.\n\nEmo is a just one of those trendy words that people use to describe everything. Idiots run around calling music emo when there's no reason for it to be or because they don't like it or whatever.\n\nEmo isn't the right word to describe FF7, really it makes more sense in the context of FF8 because of how Squall acts unreasonably depressed and is mean to others. And then has all of this teen angst relationship stuff going on."
