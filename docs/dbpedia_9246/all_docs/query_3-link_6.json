        "text": "The coup against Gorbachev\n\nThat the Soviet Union was disintegrating had been subtly apparent for some time, but the final act began at 4:50 pm on Sunday, August 18, 1991. Soviet Pres. Mikhail Gorbachev was at his dacha in the Crimean resort of Foros when he was contacted by four men requesting an audience. They were his chief of staff, Valery Boldin; Oleg Baklanov, first deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. defense council; Oleg Shenin, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU); and Gen. Valentin Varennikov, chief of the Soviet Army’s ground forces. They were accompanied by KGB Gen. Yury Plekhanov, chief of security for party and state personnel. Their unexpected arrival aroused Gorbachev’s suspicions, and, when he tried to use the phone, it was dead. They had come to demand, in the name of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in the U.S.S.R., that Gorbachev sign a document declaring a state of emergency and transferring power to his vice president, Gennady Yanayev. They were taken aback when Gorbachev refused and rebuked them as treasonous blackmailers.\n\nGorbachev and his family were placed under house arrest by Gen. Igor Maltsev, commander-in-chief of the Soviet Air Defense Troops. Both Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, later stated that they had fully expected to be killed. Although outside communication had been cut off, Gorbachev was able to get word to Moscow and confirm that he was fit and well. Members of Gorbachev’s personal bodyguard remained loyal throughout the episode, and they were able to fashion a simple receiver so that the imperiled president could learn what was happening beyond the walls of the dacha. BBC and Voice of America broadcasts kept Gorbechev abreast of the coup’s progress and international reaction to it.\n\nJust after 6:00 am Moscow time on August 19, TASS and Radio Moscow proclaimed that “ill health” had prevented Gorbachev from executing his duties and that, in accordance with Article 127-7 of the Soviet constitution, Yanayev had assumed the powers of the presidency. Yanayev headed an eight-member Emergency Committee. Its other members were Baklanov; Vladimir Kryuchkov, chairman of the U.S.S.R. KGB; Premier Valentin Pavlov; Minister of Internal Affairs Boris Pugo; Vasily Starodubtsev, chairman of the Farmers’ Union; Aleksandr Tizyakov, president of the U.S.S.R. Association of State Enterprises; and Minister of Defense Marshal Dmitry Yazov. They soon issued Resolution No. 1, which banned strikes and demonstrations and imposed press censorship. There was also an address to the Soviet people claiming that “mortal danger hangs over our great fatherland.”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nComprehension Quiz: Cold War\n\nThe planned signing on August 20 of a new union treaty that would have weakened central control over the republics appeared to explain the timing of the coup. A sharp attack on the union treaty by Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, was distributed by TASS early on August 19. The U.S.S.R. Cabinet of Ministers met later that morning, and most of the ministers supported the coup. All but nine newspapers were banned.\n\nTanks appeared on the streets of Moscow, and the city’s population immediately began attempting to dissuade troops from obeying orders. Protesters began gathering around the White House, the Russian parliament building, and started erecting barricades. At 12:50 pm Russian Pres. Boris Yeltsin climbed atop a tank in front of the White House, condemned the coup and called for an immediate general strike. He later issued a presidential edict declaring the coup illegal and the plotters “criminals” and “traitors.” Russian officials were not to obey the orders of the Emergency Committee. At 5:00 pm Yanayev and the other coup leaders held a press conference. Yanayev claimed that the country had become “ungovernable” but hoped that his “friend President Gorbachev” would eventually return to his post. The president was “very tired” and was being “treated in the south,” Yanayev explained. He appeared visibly nervous, and his hands trembled during the presentation.\n\nYeltsin appealed to the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Aleksey II, to condemn the coup. The patriarch criticized Gorbachev’s detention and anathematized those involved in the plot. Meanwhile, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Lieut. Gen. Viktor Samsonov declared himself chairman of the Leningrad State of Emergency Committee and placed the city under military control. However, Leningrad’s mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, returned from Moscow by air, aided by KGB agents who opposed the coup. Sobchak rallied the opposition and appealed to soldiers to hand over officers who had helped organize the coup. In the process, he won over Samsonov, who promised not to move troops into the city. In Moscow some elite tank regiments defected and took up defensive positions around the White House."
