        "text": "6 The Resolution of 1932\n\n1932 was a crucial year in Soviet history. The first Five-Year Plan was nearly completed, and the partial collectivization of the land had been accomplished, though at the price of incredible hardship. The second Five-Year Plan, inaugurated in 1932, was to stress industrialization and productivity. Masses of people were moved to provide the necessary labour force in far-away regions. There was much idealism among young people assigned to these tasks, but there was also much unrest and discontent aggravated by the famine of 1931-33. The atmosphere was one of crisis.\n\nReturning from Paris in the early summer of 1932, Ehrenburg described the mood at home and the new generation born on the eve of the First World War.\n\n“Those were extraordinary days; for the second time our country was shaken up by a tornado; but if the first one—during the Civil War years—had seemed elemental . . ., this time collectivization and the laying of the foundations of heavy industry . . . were determined by an exact plan . . . subordinated ... to the iron laws of necessity”.1 . . . “To them [the new generation], the Tsar, the factory owners, the policemen were abstract notions . . . Observing them closely, I detected many contradictions. The process of democratization of culture is slow and complicated. During the first twenty-five years, culture was broadened at the expense of depth; at the outset, universal literacy led to an intellectual semiliteracy, to over-simplification.”2\n\nOne of the most effective means to mould the minds of this eager generation was through literature—a literature purposeful and controlled. One of Lenin’s earliest tenets was the “partyness” of literature; he and his successors considered the printed word of paramount importance while the other arts were subordinate. It was primarily this concern with literature—torn by internal dissent—that brought about the Party Resolution of 23 April 1932, entitled' ‘On the Reconstruction of Literary and Artistic Organizations”.3\n\nThis Resolution has been called historic. It signified the end of an era of flexibility, and inaugurated one of regimentation. It transformed Soviet arts from multiformity to conformity and, ultimately, to uniformity. On the surface, the tone of the Resolution was conciliatory. There were no denunciations of the past; on the contrary, it was stated that “literature and the arts have, in the past few years, exhibited a considerable growth” which was due to the “success of Socialist construction”. However, it was found that “the framework of existing proletarian literary-artistic organizations had become too narrow” and that there was danger of sectarianism leading to the alienation of many artists who were otherwise sympathetic to the Socialist cause. Therefore, the Party’s Central Committee resolved to “liquidate the Association of Proletarian Writers” and similar artistic organizations. In pi ace of these dissolved groups, single unions were to be established, each containing a Communist faction. Membership was to be open to all artists “upholding the platform of the Soviet regime and striving to participate in Socialist construction”. Despite the voluntary aspect of membership, the political climate was such that no artist could afford not to join.\n\nThe Resolution of 1932 achieved several purposes: it displaced the rebellious proletarian “leaders” who had outlived their usefulness, it widened the organized circle of artists under the banner of “Socialist construction”, and it insured Party control of the new organizations by the built-in “Communist factions”. To many artists, who were repelled by the proletarian arrogance of the previous leaders, the Resolution seemed a liberalizing step, and it was received with widespread approval. Little did they realise that they exchanged the dictatorship of a small clique for the control of a super-power—the Soviet government and the bureaucratic machinery of the Party.\n\nAt the First All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers, held in 1934, Gorky’s presence lent prestige to the keynote address of Andrei Zhdanov, the Party’s representative—the same Zhdanov who acquired such notoriety in the cultural purges of the late 1940’s. Zhdanov defined the aims of Socialist Realism, “to depict reality in its revolutionary development”, and he called for “works attuned to the epoch”. A year earlier, in 1933, Gorky had published an essay, On Socialist Realism, which is still considered valid as a basic definition of this new concept. Gorky’s words are those of an artist, while Zhdanov spoke as a political realist.4 Stalin, too, made a contribution to the definition of that elusive term: he mentioned “cultures, national in form and Socialist in substance”.\n\nThe Writers’ Congress—coming as it did two short years after the Resolution and the establishment of the Writers’ Union—was a festive occasion. For two weeks, Moscow was the meeting place of Soviet writers from all over the country and prominent guests from the West. “The Congress has remained in my memory as a great and marvellous festival,” wrote Ehrenburg. “The crowded hall was like a theatre: ovations greeted favourite authors, felicitous speeches elicited applause.” Among the speakers were Pasternak, Isaac Babel, Fadeyev, Malraux and Aragon from France, Ernst Toller from Germany. Yet, the outlook was clouded: “the smoke of the Fascist book-burning reached us from Germany . . . Fascist riots in Paris, the crushing of the Schutzbund ... We were conscious of the looming menace of war,” recalls Ehrenburg.5\n\nCompared to literature, music was in a more unsettled position. The composers lacked a dominant personality comparable to Maxim Gorky, and there was no one to pull the feuding factions together. Glazunov—once a tower of strength in the early years of the Revolution—was in Paris, old and ill. Miaskovsky was politically too naive. Prokofiev had recently returned to Moscow after fifteen years abroad, and for a time was a stranger in his own land. Asafiev was temporarily compromised by his activity in the modernist faction. Worst of all, the music-loving Lunacharsky had been removed from his post as cultural commissar in 1929. His successor was a Party functionary, Andrei Bubnov, who had no connection with music.\n\nOn the eve of the Resolution of 1932, Soviet composers were in a state of tension, disunity, and frustration. Critics pointed out the creative failure in the field of the topical Soviet opera—a genre considered most important. The attempts to switch to “Soviet thematics” were clumsy and artificial. The traditionalist composers felt neglected and ignored, the Association for Contemporary Music had quietly disintegrated, while the Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM) dominated the musical scene almost unopposed. Early in 1932, rumours were rife that some official action was impending. An important meeting was held at the People’s Commissariat of Education on 23 April at seven o’clock. Here is an eye witness report,\n\n‘There is an atmosphere of excitement—all the composers and musical workers of Moscow and Leningrad are gathered here. All ages and all wings of creative musical craft of Soviet culture are represented, from Ippolitov-Ivanov to the leaders of RAPM . . . Those assembled are grouped according to trends and tendencies. There is restrained talk. The serious faces reflect one question: what is going to happen? It is apparent that something unusual is in the air. Possibly a decisive battle . . . Comrade Bubnov opens the discussion dealing with problems of construction in Soviet musical culture; he points out some deficiencies in this field. He asks for a frank discussion, to the bitter end . . . Those present take the floor one after another, and attack the RAPM with extraordinary vehemence. Its theoretical, creative, and tactical attitudes are under fire. Many speeches reveal rancour: theoretical contentions give way to echoes of recent feuds. Feelings run high ... It is clear that RAPM’S rule, which limits the sphere of creative work, causes unhealthy conditions for the development of Soviet music . . . On 24 April, the Moscow papers publish the decree of the Central Committee, announcing the dissolution of all Proletarian arts associations . . .”6\n\nClearly, this was not an overnight decision, but a well-prepared political coup. The public debate did not influence the decision, yet it was useful as a barometer of public sentiment: the Proletarian Musicians were doomed.\n\nThe ban of RAPM and the plans for a new creative organization produced a surge of unity among composers. Most elated were the academicians and traditionalists who for years had felt constricted by extremist factions. One composer is reported to have quipped, “Now I can write music in three-four time”—alluding to RAPM’S insistence on march rhythms as most appropriate for a proletarian society. Approval came from older, highly respected masters like Ippolitov-Ivanov, Vassilenko, Glière, Miaskovsky. In Leningrad, such contrasting figures as Shaporin, Asafiev, and Shostakovich spoke up in favour. In fact, support for the new Resolution came from all quarters. Musicians who had belonged to the—now discredited—proletarian RAPM or the modernist ACM hurriedly abandoned their lost causes to join the Party-decreed union. By this time, the volte-face had become a technique indispensable for survival.\n\nThe new association of composers and musicologists, established in accordance with the 1932 Resolution, was named Soyuz Sovetskikh Kompozitorov (Union of Soviet Composers)*. The first to be organized were city groups in Moscow and Leningrad, followed quickly by state-wide unions in the Ukraine, in Byelorussia, Georgia, and Armenia. By 1940, there were composers’ unions in most of the republics and in many urban centres. At first, the nation-wide organization seems to have been rather loose until, in 1939, the Organizational Committee (ORGKOMITET) of the Composers’ Union of the USSR was established by government decree. Compared with progress in the field of literature, the organization of composers proceeded rather slowly; while the Soviet writers were able to mount their first national congress in 1934, the Soviet composers did not hold a nation-wide conference until 1948, sixteen years after the establishment of the Union. Numerically, the Composers’ Union was always small: its prestige and influence is not based on numbers but on quality. Only the creative musical élite is admitted: those who write music—composers, and those who write about music—musicologists. Among the latter are included, rather broadly, critics, theorists, historians, lecturers, and authors on various musical subjects. Uniting composers and critics in a single organization was not accidental; the aim was to promote an atmosphere of creative stimulation. The practical results, however, were not quite so idyllic; the composers did not care to be criticized, creatively or otherwise, while the critics did not dare to criticize whenever the works of a well-known composer were involved. Lesser composers felt neglected and resentful while their prominent colleagues were boosted by the press. The smouldering animosity burst into the open during the cultural purge of 1948 when the “kowtowing critics” received their share of public castigation.\n\nThe position of the newly established Composers’ Union was strengthened when it acquired its own journal, Sovetskaya Muzyka (Soviet Music). It began to appear in 1933 as a bi-monthly, with an initial printing of 3,000 copies, each containing some 150 pages (of course without any advertising). The following year, Sovetskaya Muzyka became a monthly, and today it has a circulation of 18,000. During the war years, the regular publication was interrupted and replaced by several yearbooks. While the Composers’ Union is primarily responsible for the journal’s contents (it is run by an editorial committee), the Ministry of Culture appears as co-sponsor on the masthead which adds to its official status.\n\nAt the time Sovetskaya Muzyka was established, there was a desperate need for a publication reflecting the broad spectrum of the musical scene. During the cultural crisis of 1930, most music journals had ceased publication; the only one to survive until 1932 was Proletarskyi Muzykant (Proletarian Musician), the wildly partisan mouthpiece of the proletarian wing.\n\nThe editorial policy of Sovetskaya Muzyka was based on the assumption that the Resolution of 1932 had eliminated all intra-musical factionalism. Discussion was permitted, but not dissent; the cultural policy dictated by the Party’s Central Committee could not be questioned. Within this framework, however, there was still room for lively discussion of musical subjects in the fields of theory, history aesthetics, and performance. There were important debates on the problems of genres—the opera, the symphony—there were analyses of new compositions, book reviews, critical columns on new operas, ballets, concerts, interviews with foreign visitors, translated excerpts from foreign publications. The monthly issues of Sovetskaya Muzyka were a lively mirror of musical life in the entire Soviet Union; the reports from abroad (often rather partisan) became the only contact with the outside world available to a Soviet musician. Aside from the repetitive political harangues, Sovetskaya Muzyka is still an excellent musical journal; because it attempts to cover so much, it cannot allot sufficient space to lesser events. To fill this gap, and to provide a more popular survey of the musical scene, a new bi-weekly journal, Muzyk- alnaya Zhizn (Musical Life) was established in 1957. Special mention must be made of the musical supplements carried in both journals. Occasionally, good short pieces are published, but for the most part the music printed consists of political mass songs or patriotic marches which are embarrassingly mediocre.\n\nThe first editorial of Sovetskaya Muzyka, in January 1933, stated as the main task the development of a Marxist-Leninist musicology; it also promised to fight the ideology of the modernists as well as the leftist interpretation of Marxism. While the organizations representing these views (mainly the modem ACM and the proletarian RAPM) were dissolved, the editorial rightly assumed that former members of these groups had not renounced all dangerous thoughts. Conformity or silence became the formula for survival. Asafiev, until recently the guiding spirit of the modernist wing, defined the process glibly as “the growth of political consciousness of the Soviet composer searching persistently for creative solutions”.7\n\nThe new “creative solution” was to be Socialist Realism. Musicians began to discuss this concept a year prior to the historic Writers’ Congress in 1934. The first issue of Sovetskaya Muzyka printed an article by the critic Gorodinsky entitled “On the Problem of Socialist Realism in Music”. Indeed it was a problem to translate this—essentially literary—concept into musical terms. The Composers’ Union contributed the following guidelines which make up in belligerence what they lack in clarity,\n\n“The main attention of the Soviet composer must be directed towards the victorious progressive principles of reality, towards all that is heroic, bright, and beautiful. This distinguishes the spiritual world of Soviet man and must be embodied in musical images full of beauty and strength. Socialist Realism demands an implacable struggle against folk-negating modernistic directions that are typical of the decay of contemporary bourgeois art, against subservience and servility towards modern bourgeois culture.”8\n\nThe negative “modernistic directions” soon gained the label of Formalism. The term was used so loosely that Prokofiev once quipped, “Formalism is music that people don’t understand at first hearing.”9 Though poorly defined, Socialist Realism and Formalism became the two opposing concepts which have bedevilled Soviet musical aesthetics from the early 1930’s to the present day.\n\nThe Resolution of 1932 came at a time when Soviet music was in a state of crisis. A vicious campaign by the proletarian RAPM had discredited musical modernism by equating it with “bourgeois decadence”. It forced the withdrawal of several modern productions that were in the planning stage, among them Prokofiev’s ballet Pas d’acier. The mood of the country was not geared to stylized experiment. On the contrary, there was a general retreat into rose-coloured “realism”.\n\nAs a result, advanced composers turned conventional, and conventional composers became commonplace. Young composers endeavoured to be inoffensive, and conservatism became a cherished virtue, while musical nationalism experienced a revival. But music merely reflected a general trend in changing Soviet attitudes during the 1930’s. Realizing that the plan for world revolution had failed—at least temporarily—Soviet leaders became avowed nationalists. Patriotism was no longer limited to pride in the “conquests of the Revolution” but was extended to include Russia’s historic past. In fact, the entire concept and teaching of history was reversed. The views of Mikhail Pokrovsky, until his death in 1932 the leading Soviet historian, were discarded as a vulgarization of Marxism and a distortion of Russian history. The glory of Russia was restored, the tsars re-evaluated, including Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible. In literature, the new attitude produced a large number of historical novels and plays. In music, this mood was reflected in epic works like the symphonic cantata On the Field of Kulikovo (1939) by Yuri Shaporin, commemorating the battle with the Mongols in 1380, or the oratorio Alexander Nevsky by Prokofiev, depicting the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in 1242. The latter was originally a film directed by Sergei Eisenstein (1938) for which Prokofiev had written a stirring score.\n\nThe decade of the 1930’s also witnessed the emergence of what has been called a “new respectability” in Soviet life. On the home front, there was a revival of almost Victorian standards of morality, restoration of school discipline, and abandonment of many “progressive” innovations. The Constitution of the USSR was adopted with great pomp in December 1936. In foreign policy, the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations with the United States, entered the League of Nations, and concluded an alliance with France. Even the atheism campaign seemed to slacken: the famed poet, Demyan Bednyi, wrote a new libretto for an old opera pasticcio, Bogatyri (with music by Borodin and others). Performed in Moscow in October 1936, it had to be withdrawn because Bednyi had belittled Russia’s conversion to Christianity in the tenth century!\n\nUnder these conditions, it is not surprising that Soviet music moved to a plateau of safe conservatism. Topical symphonies, descriptive tone poems, and folklore genres dominated the field, with the use of traditional materials in the time-honoured tradition of the “Mighty Five” school. Prokofiev, recently returned from abroad, foresaw the implications of this trend and warned the composers against incipient provincialism. His prophetic words created deep resentment, and years later they were repeated accusingly.\n\nIn the midst of this flight into “provincialism”, the position of Prokofiev is of particular interest. After his permanent return to Moscow in 1933, he faced a difficult problem of musical readjustment. True, he had received an enthusiastic welcome in 1927 when he visited the Soviet Union for an extensive tour of concerts, all devoted to his own works. The reception was noticeably cooler when he returned in 1929 and again in 1932 because the works he now presented were more problematic. It was difficult—and perhaps painful—for him to realize that many of the compositions he had written abroad, between 1918 and 1932, failed to impress his Soviet compatriots.* They warmly responded to the brilliant Third Piano Concerto, the charming Classical Symphony, the humorous Suite from the Three Oranges, but they were cold and critical towards such works as the Second Symphony, the Fifth Piano Concerto, the Overture Op. 42, or the Quintet Op. 39, all written in his more astringent style. Prokofiev was frankly puzzled by this lack of understanding and response to what he considered some of his best music. “I do not want Soviet audiences to judge me only by the March from the Three Oranges and the Gavotte from the Classical Symphony,” he wrote in 1933.10 But eventually he realized that he had to make certain concessions.\n\nProkofiev’s mastery was such that he could write “accessible” music without lowering its quality. He had done it in his opera The Love for Three Oranges, a commission from Chicago, where he took into account the “American taste”. He was ready to do the same for Soviet audiences as he wrote in 1934, “In the Soviet Union music is addressed to millions of people who formerly had little or no contact with music. It is this new mass audience that the modem Soviet composer must strive to reach.” At the time he seriously believed that these new millions needed a special approach—a type of “light-serious music, primarily melodious, written in clear, yet original terms.”12 Among the music in this category Prokofiev named the symphonic suite Egyptian Nights and the score to Lieutenant Kije. But by 1937 he changed his position and became convinced that the new audiences needed no concessions, “The masses want great music . . . they understand far more than some composers think ... I consider it a mistake to strive for simplification . . .”13\n\nDespite all rationalizations, some of Prokofiev’s newer works were received with indifference, others even remained unpublished and unperformed. For example, the Fifth Piano Concerto, introduced by the composer in December 1932 left the Moscow audience completely cold; even his old friend Miaskovsky found two of the movements “not very pleasing”. The Moscow première of the Symphonic Song Op. 57 in 1934 was a failure; Miaskovsky recalled that “there were literally three claps of applause in the hall”. One critic called the work “a sad tale of the decline of the fading culture of individualism”; it was not published. A painful disappointment was the jubilee Cantata Op. 74 for the Twentieth Anniversary of the October Revolution, set to words by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin: it remained unperformed* and unpublished. His first Soviet opera, Semyon Kotko (1940), produced a controversy and was removed from the repertoire. In his efforts to find a musical idiom accessible to broad audiences, he approached a new genre, the mass song, yet the results were not memorable.\n\nBut outweighing these failures were a number of masterpieces that added new lustre to Prokofiev’s fame. Suffice it to mention Lieutenant Kije (1934), the ballet Romeo and Juliet (1935-36), the children’s tale Peter and the Wolf (1936), the Second Violin Concerto (1935), the score to Alexander Nevsky (1939). Generally speaking, there is greater warmth and more spontaneous expressiveness in Prokofiev’s musical idiom of the 1930’s. It was undoubtedly the effect of his confrontation with the “new” Soviet audiences; the problem of reaching the people was constantly in his mind, as he expressed it in 1937, “Music in our country has become the heritage of vast masses of people. Their artistic taste and demands are growing with amazing speed. And this is something the Soviet composer must take into account in each new work.”14\n\nIt was this desire to compose music in his homeland, for the Russian people, that explains in part his decision, in 1933, to settle in Moscow. It was a decision dictated by nostalgia rather than politics, for Prokofiev was essentially non-political. At the time, he was in the midst of a creative crisis: his career in the West was stagnant, and his style was no longer considered trend-setting in modem music. He confided to a French critic, Serge Moreux, in 1933, “The air of foreign lands does not inspire me because I am Russian, and there is nothing more harmful to me than to live in exile ... I must again immerse myself in the atmosphere of my homeland ... I must hear Russian speech and talk with the people dear to me. This will give me what I lack here, for their songs are my songs... I’m afraid of falling into academicism. Yes, my friend, I am going home.”15\n\nIt was Russia that beckoned him, not the Soviet regime nor Marxism. The last twenty years of his life, spent “at home”, were not cloudless: there were failures, brutal disappointments and unjustified criticism. But there were also warm response, sincere admiration, and that intangible flow of inspiration filtered through people and landscape, language and tradition. Here, his music acquired a quality of lyric expansiveness, of deepened humanism that created a new bond of communication with his audiences.\n\nProkofiev’s return to Russia was a milestone in the development of Soviet music. It was more meaningful than the return of Gorky, for Prokofiev was at the peak of his creative power while Gorky was in his decline. Prokofiev was refreshingly frank and outspoken, as yet unafraid of political pressures, willing to learn but equally willing to criticize. He had always been cool to a certain stale Russian traditionalism whose personification he saw in Glazunov. He once reproached his old friend Miaskovsky for occasional “Glazunovisms”. His critique of “academicism” came at an awkward time when Soviet music was turning academic, retrospective, when the entire cultural policy of the Soviets was redirected towards conservatism. This led to some clashes with his confreres who did not hesitate to criticize his occasional “relapse” into a style too “modern” or “formalistic”, as the term went. On such occasions he was treated like a recidivist.\n\nShortly after his return to Moscow, Prokofiev agreed to teach a few post-graduate composition students at the Conservatory although he had no previous pedagogical experience. He began by attending some of Miaskovsky’s and Shebalin’s classes where he met two star students—Khachaturian and Khrennikov. “Prokofiev’s remarks were friendly, specific, and to the point,” recalled Khachaturian;16 others remembered him as somewhat aloof and haughty. However, teaching did not appeal to Prokofiev: he was so immersed in his own creative plans that he was reluctant to spend time for anything not directly connected with composing. He even declined to give a recital of his own works, remarking that the preparation “would cost him half a piano sonata”. Prokofiev’s connection with the Moscow Conservatory was shortlived, but he continued to take an interest in the development of young talent, and he was always ready to contribute creative criticism.\n\nAt the time, the Composers’ Union inaugurated a new type of “collective” work. New compositions, often half-finished, were played in closed sessions to fellow composers and musicologist-critics. These auditions were designed to guide young composers although experienced masters also participated in such try-outs, mainly to check the reaction of professional listeners. The mutual criticism was often sharp and controversial, and particularly a young composer would not dare disregard the judgment of such an illustrious forum. The system—which has survived until today—was designed to be helpful, but in practice it amounted to a control of creativity, well-meaning but nevertheless decisive. The insistence on conformity was particularly hard on young talents who were eager to explore new paths. The directorate of the Composers’ Union was expected to offer guidance and to be vigilant, and during the cultural purge of 1948, the entire directorate was held responsible for creative failures of composers.. . failure meaning, in this case, the deviation from the principles of Socialist Realism and the preoccupation with Formalism.\n\nThe year 1934 brought two events—totally unrelated at first; yet, what grew out of these events became later strangely intertwined. One was the rise of an opera, the other the violent death of a politician. On 22 January a new opera by Shostakovich, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, had a triumphant première in Leningrad; it was hailed as a great achievement of Soviet culture. On 1 December the leader of the Communist Party in Leningrad, Sergei Kirov, was assassinated in his office. He was succeeded by Andrei Zhdanov, the Party’s spokesman at the Writers’ Congress in 1934.\n\nThe impact of these two events did not become fully apparent until two years later: in 1936, a virulent attack on Shostakovich and musical modernism forced the withdrawal of Lady Macbeth and a general re-orientation of Soviet music; that same year brought an intensification of political terror, culminating in the great purge that cut deeply into every stratum of Soviet life. So intimidated was the musical community that hardly anyone dared to speak up in defence of Shostakovich who, at thirty, had reached the pinnacle of musical fame.\n\nShostakovich’s music of the early 1930’s cannot be categorized as belonging outright to one or the other of the opposing musical philosophies. The modernists pointed with pride to his satirical opera The Nose, the ballets Bolt and The Golden Age. The proletarian wing claimed him on the strength of his symphonies October and May Day as well as the collective farm ballet The Limpid Stream. The traditionalists took comfort in his euphonious Cello Sonata. Shostakovich belonged to all, and to none. He proved his independent spirit by taking Leskov’s classical short story, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, reshaping it into a psychological drama with socio-critical overtones, and providing it with a score of modern verismo, in turn glowing, crude, satirical, and impassioned.\n\nSoviet critics, while deploring some of the more lurid aspects of the opera, considered it nevertheless “the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party”17 as stated in the “historic decree” of 23 April 1932. Such an opera “could have been written only by a Soviet composer brought up in the best traditions of Soviet culture”. Shostakovich was credited with having “tom off the masks and exposed the false and lying methods of the composers of bourgeois society . . .”18 The conductor of the première, Samosud, summarized the general feeling in these words, “I declare Lady Macbeth a work of genius, and I am convinced that posterity will confirm this estimate. One cannot help feeling proud that, in a Soviet musical theatre, an opera has been created that overshadows all that can possibly be accomplished in the operatic art of the capitalist world. Here, too, our culture has indeed not only overtaken, but surpassed, the most advanced capitalist countries.”19\n\nAmerican critics were not slow in taking up this challenge: they blamed every shortcoming of the opera on Communism. In his article, “Socialism at the Metropolitan”, the critic-composer Virgil Thomson described this reaction, “The New York critics hedged. In fact, the degree of approval expressed by them was in pretty close proportion to the political leftness of the respective newspaper for which they work . . .” Thomson—who liked the opera—added, “For educated people to protest at this late date about the rough-and-ready tone of Socialist art is really just a shade more than stupid.”20 But, in fact, how “Socialist” is this art? Neither the Soviets nor Virgil Thomson present a convincing case. Closer to the truth is Gerald Abraham who wrote, “So little was Socialist Realism understood at first that Lady Macbeth was accepted as an embodiment of it.”21\n\nBe this as it may, some of the capitalist critics were outraged at the lurid happenings on the stage and in the pit. William Henderson wrote in The New York Sun, “Shostakovich is without doubt the foremost composer of pornographic music in the history of the opera.” He called Lady Macbeth a “bed-chamber opera” and said that “passages which in their faithful portrayal of what is going on become obscene. If this is musical art, then it is time for sackcloth and ashes”.22 Henderson must have been thinking of the suggestive trombone slides that accompanied the seduction scene—an effect described by an American journal as “pomophony”. It shocked and delighted the New York audience, though it was dropped in Leningrad, and Olin Downes of The New York Times wrote, “Its cheapest and most obvious features... won the most frenzied applause . . .” Downes, incidentally, was quite critical of Shostakovich’s score which he found “flimsily put together, full of reminiscences and obvious and shallow tricks, with almost no originality or creative quality, attached to a libretto of Communistic hue, lurid, overdrawn, naive, sensational . . .” (Why “Communistic” is a mystery.) Yet, Downes concedes the “immense success” of the work and ascribes it to the “composer’s feeling for the theatre”. “The music, whatever its inner lacks, seldom fails to emphasize the doings on the stage.” But “pages of this music are puerile in immaturity and naiveté” and he accuses Shostakovich of “effrontery and lack of self-criticism”.23\n\nObviously, the New York reviews were carefully read in Moscow. When Howard Taubman, representing The New York Times, met with members of the Soviet Composers’ Union in Moscow in September 1935,* he was told that Lady Macbeth was a significant work of “powerful realism and satirical pungency”; the occasional “overripe naturalism” was allegedly “misunderstood” by American critics as vulgarity.24\n\nThe conductor Artur Rodzinski, who regarded Lady Macbeth as “a sensational masterpiece and one of the most important contributions to contemporary music brought out in the past twenty-five years”,25 was primarily responsible for the American performances of Lady Macbeth and conducted the première in Cleveland on 31 January 1935 and a performance in New York on 5 February.**\n\nThe Swiss musicologist R.-Aloys Mooser (who in his youth had studied Russian music in St. Petersburg) heard Lady Macbeth during the “First Leningrad Music Festival’* in June 1934. The music, Mooser wrote, is “of prodigious intensity and brutal realism . . . The dramatic scenes are treated with incredible vigour. They are impassioned and exciting, and they move at an extraordinary pace without ever being lengthy. And the musical idiom is so powerful and evocative, the accents are so spontaneous and so truthful that the impression is infinitely perturbing.” Mooser admits that some effects are deafening—as are so many Soviet compositions. But there is, in this opera, “such a sense of action and movement, such intense and vibrant vitality, something so frenetic and hallucinatory, that the spectator, even the coldest and most sceptic, emerges breathless, shaken, moved almost against his will by the violence and insight of the composer’s language.”26\n\nThe opera aroused a great deal of international interest. Stockholm, Prague, London, Ljubljana, Zurich, Copenhagen are among the cities that performed the work in 1935-36. In Russia, the success was extraordinary: by 1936 there had been eighty-three performances in Leningrad and ninety-seven in Moscow. The piano score, with Russian and English texts, was published by MUZGIZ in 1935. Everything pointed to a lasting success.\n\nThe crushing blow came on 28 January 1936, when Pravda published a slashing attack on Shostakovich’s opera under the title “Sumbur vmesto muzyki” (Chaos Instead of Music).27 It was followed a week later (6 February) by a second article, this time directed against a recent ballet of Shostakovich on a Soviet topic, The Limpid Stream. Both articles were unsigned which gave them the standing of official policy pronouncements, and it was revealed in 1948 that they were written on instructions from the Party’s Central Committee. Whether Stalin personally was involved in giving these instructions, whether Zhdanov was the actual author of the articles, cannot be ascertained though these facts were widely rumoured.\n\nWhile Lenin was reluctant to be drawn into artistic controversies—he referred such matters usually to Lunacharsky—Stalin knew no such modesty. Opera particularly attracted Stalin’s personal interest. His taste for pompous spectacles influenced the performance style of the Bolshoi Theatre, especially in classical Russian works. On direct instructions from Stalin, Glinka’s masterpiece A Life for the Tsar was re-staged in 1939, with a revised libretto and under the name Ivan Susanin—the first revival, twenty-two years after ‘the Revolution.* The finale was transformed into an apotheosis of patriotism, cutting the music to fit the new concept: masses of people, horses on the stage, warriors and priests in resplendent armour and robes, the gleaming white walls of the Kremlin topped by the golden cupolas of the churches.\n\nStalin also had his own ideas on contemporary Soviet opera. He listed its desirable basic attributes—a libretto with a Socialist topic, a realistic musical language with stress on a national idiom, and a positive hero typifying the new Socialist era. These criteria were submitted to a group of opera specialists at a meeting on 17 January 1936.\n\nThat same evening, Stalin—accompanied by Molotov and commissar of education Bubnov—attended a performance of an opera by a young composer, Ivan Dzerzhinsky, The Quiet Don, based on Mikhail Sholokhov’s famous novel. Stalin was highly pleased, and his comments were given wide publicity. A few days later, Stalin saw Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk by Shostakovich and found it repugnant. Indeed, nothing could be further from Stalin’s idyllic concept of contemporary Soviet opera than Shostakovich’s explosive psychological drama, based on a story of murder, greed, and lust—though Leskov’s heroine Katerina Izmailova was re-shaped into a more sympathetic character.\n\nPravda’s attack on Shostakovich was two-pronged, the opera libretto was criticized for its crudity and vulgarity, the ballet for ideological “falsehood”. More important, however, was the critique of the music, for it transcended the specific case of Shostakovich by condemning modernism in general.\n\n“From the first moment, the listener is shocked by a deliberately dissonant, confused stream of sound. Fragments of melody, embryonic phrases appear—only to disappear again in the din, the grinding, and the screaming . . . This music is built on the basis of rejecting opera ... which carries into the theatre and the music the most negative features of ‘Meyerholdism’* infinitely multiplied. Here we have ‘leftist’ confusion instead of natural, human music . .. The danger of this trend to Soviet music is clear. Leftist distortion in opera stems from the same source as the leftist distortion in painting, poetry, teaching, and science. Petty- bourgeois innovations lead to a break with real art, real science, and real literature .. . All this is coarse, primitive, and vulgar. The music quacks, grunts, and growls, and suffocates itself, in order to express the amatory scenes as naturalistically as possible. And ‘love’ is smeared all over the opera in the most vulgar manner. The merchant’s double bed occupies the central position on the stage. On it all ‘problems’ are solved ...”\n\nWith this abusive outburst, Lady Macbeth was expelled from the Socialist orbit. As an ideological parting shot, Pravda added, “Lady Macbeth enjoys great success with audiences abroad. Is it not because the opera is absolutely unpolitical and confusing that they praise it? Is it not explained by the fact that it tickles the perverted tastes of the bourgeoisie with its fidgety, screaming, neurotic music . . .?”\n\nOstensibly, the Pravda article was directed against Shostakovich alone, but it contained sufficient warnings against his admirers and potential imitators. While the Resolution of 1932 was supposed to have silenced all factionalism, the modernists among musicians and critics had not simply vanished—they just kept still. In fact, Shostakovich was the lone survivor of what, in the 1920’s, had been a vigorous avant-garde school of music. Roslavetz and Mossolov were silenced, Miaskovsky and Shcherbachev had become middle-of-the-road composers, Knipper and Deshevov had turned to realist music. Only Prokofiev could be mentioned in the class of “advanced” Soviet composers at that time—and he understood the veiled threat, as he admitted later, in the tense year 1948.*\n\nThe Pravda articles were interpreted by the entire musical community as a timely warning. Immediately, meetings were called at all chapters of the Composers’ Union, discussions were initiated, statements were issued, and in general the future of Soviet music was charted. The transcripts of the discussions in Leningrad and Moscow, published in the journal Sovetskaya Muzyka,28 make sad reading. Few voices were raised in sympathy or defence of Shostakovich, everybody had to think of his own career, involvement, and safety. These were far from normal times in the Soviet Union—the purges were on—and this might excuse, or at least explain, the detached attitude of colleagues and friends towards Shostakovich. His works were removed from programmes; conductors and soloists made quick readjustments. Yet, one sentence in Pravda’s diatribe permitted some lenience; after enumerating the composer’s “errors”, it said, “All this is not due to a lack of talent, or to a lack of ability to depict simple and strong emotions.” Not Shostakovich’s talent, but his “formalistic” tendency was condemned. Hence, the composer Knipper was on safe ground when he said during the discussion, “One must not remove Shostakovich from the rolls of Soviet music. One must not drive nails into his coffin. One must help him to straighten himself out.” In the same vein, Asafiev and Dzerzhinsky warned against dismissing him from the front ranks of Soviet composers. Rather touching were the words of Professor Steinberg, Shostakovich’s former composition teacher at the Conservatory,\n\n“The drama of Shostakovich is my own personal drama, and I cannot remain indifferent to what my pupil experiences in his creative work ... The most extreme expression of Shostakovich’s ‘new’ tendency were the Aphorisms Op. 13 (1927). When he showed them to me, I told him that I understood nothing in them, and that they were quite alien to me. After that he stopped coming to me .. .”29*\n\nEverybody expected some utterance from Asafiev, known as the spiritual leader of the Soviet modernists of the 1920’s, the author of a book on Stravinsky and of various essays on modem music. Asafiev did not participate in the debate; he was given the privilege of answering in writing, and his answer—entitled “Exciting Questions” (Volnuyushchie voprosy)—was printed in the same issue of Sovetskaya Muzyka as the transcript of the discussion; hence it became part of the record. Asafiev’s apologia is cleverly written. He admits past errors of judgment from which he was rescued by two circumstances—his intense study of the music of Mussorgsky** and his involvement with, and final rejection of, Alban Berg’s Wozzeck.*** His final sentence is rather limp, “The problem of the improvement of the idiom and creative method of Shostakovich as well as of a number of other composers—this, in sum, is the problem of the evolution of Soviet music, stated brilliantly in the timely articles of Pravda.’’30\n\nOf course this is a shrewd over-simplification. Yet, Asafiev’s position must not be viewed as a clear-cut capitulation. For some time he had shown signs of disenchantment with modernism and “Westernism”. In 1929, he warned against the “rootlessness” of Stravinsky’s later music. In 1930, he wrote an essay, “The Crisis of Western Musicology”. His famous appeal, “Composers, hurry up!”—published as early as 1924—revealed his inner dichotomy: a passionate interest in musical newness, and an equally passionate belief in music as a reflection of the people. Nevertheless, he was branded by the proletarian journal, Music and October, as the “most consistent formalist”. During the years 1929-32, he felt increasingly attacked and misunderstood, particularly by the proletarian musical faction, and he withdrew in discouragement. On 15 April 1930 he wrote to his old friend, the composer Miaskovsky, “I cannot work. Nothing succeeds. My job was to infect myself with music and to write in such a way as to infect others... I have no other concept of musicology or criticism. Now, alas, one cannot write this way. So I’ve turned sour.” In his “total revulsion” against musicology, he turned to his first love, composition, where his style was wholly traditional. His ballets The Flame of Paris (1932) and The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (1934) were immensely successful.\n\nThus, at the time of the musical controversy around Shostakovich and formalism, in 1936, Asafiev’s position was that of a successful ballet composer, entirely acceptable to the Socialist Realist ideology. Hence, his article was not so much a defence as voluntary self-criticism. His was the problem of many Russian intellectuals—an attempt to justify their inner re-orientation in the face of irresistible pressures. Wozzeck revealed to Asafiev “the senselessness of human suffering in the grip of inhuman capitalist culture”; he became aware of the “helplessness of West European petit-bourgeois musical intelligentsia in the face of growing fascism”. After Wozzeck—so Asafiev explained—all dabbling in contemporaneousness—in view of Soviet reality, in view of the masses creating a new world—became nonsensical.\n\nStill to be explained was Asafiev’s earlier praise of Lady Macbeth. Here he stated simply that he was blinded by the brilliant talent of Shostakovich : the mirage of the “quality of talent’ ’ obscured the quality of the utterance. He admitted certain reservations about the style of Shostakovich—a trend towards cynicism, crude naturalism, taunting gibes, which were in jarring contrast to his “Mozartian” youthfulness. But the negative aspects, so evident in The Nose, were about to be overcome in Lady Macbeth. “We must not fail to preserve the exceptional talent of Shostakovich,” warned Asafiev. Here he paraphrased Lenin’s remarkable defence of the poet Demyan Bednyi, “You will be guilty of a sin, a great sin . . . if you fail to attract, to help a talented co-worker . . . ”*\n\nAll in all, Asafiev’s essay was a dialectic masterpiece. Without undue submissiveness, he extricated himself from a vulnerable position; it was a dignified retreat. It also encouraged others to take similar steps; if the “master” could explain away his entire past in fifteen hundred well-chosen words, there was no need to feel any compunction about offering retractions and apologies when their work, their careers, possibly their liberty was at stake. In the light of Soviet music history, however, Asafiev’s statement was more than one man’s apologia: it meant the end of an era.\n\nWhile Asafiev’s “position paper” saved him from becoming involved in the acrimonious debate raging around Shostakovich and modernism, three younger critics—described as a “group of militant formalists” in Leningrad—had to bear the brunt of verbal attacks by vengeful colleagues. They were Mikhail Druskin, Alexander Rabinovich, and Ivan Sollertinsky. All three were among the most brilliant disciples of Asafiev, and their unwillingness to recant immediately only increased the anger of their accusers. Eventually, they yielded to pressure and made the expected admissions of “error”.\n\nAt the time, Sollertinsky was the most important member of the group. He began his career as a lecturer and art critic in 1924, and entered the directorate of the Leningrad Philharmonic in 1929. About that time he formed a close friendship with Shostakovich. They both shared an admiration for the music of Mahler, and Sollertinsky may have influenced Shostakovich in the direction of modernism. In 1934, Sollertinsky wrote a perceptive study of Arnold Schoenberg—perhaps the last sympathetic account in Russian of that great modernist who became anathema to the Soviets.\n\nIn 1936, Sollertinsky was branded as the “bard” of formalism. At first, he had a defeatist reaction and wanted to abandon temporarily the field of music in order to re-think his position. He explained it later as his “unwillingness to lie, since I could not yet envisage the path of my reorientation”. On second thoughts, however, he decided to recant. In a lengthy statement, he admitted that this decision was prompted by the position taken by Asafiev. “Yesterday, at last, I heard the exhaustive, clear statement of Asafiev. I personally, like all musicologists who studied at Leningrad, consider myself his student. His silence confused me immensely. In particular, I was puzzled by the ambiguous evaluations in his book on Stravinsky. Asafiev’s clear, unmistakable clarification of his position was for me an incentive to speak out definitely and with conviction against myself and my former errors. 31\n\nIn his apologia, Sollertinsky was understandably more concerned with his own defence than with that of Shostakovich. He pointed out that he did not care for Shostakovich’s The Nose nor the dry calculations of Ernst Krenek. But he admitted that he succumbed to the emotionalism of Berg’s Wozzeck. He also admitted that he “overlooked” the fact that the “animalic eroticism” in Wozzeck (Maria and the Major) was “transferred” by Shostakovich to Lady Macbeth (Katerina and Sergei). Sollertinsky ended his statement with a flattery so obvious as to be facetious—he promised to study the language and folklore of Georgia—which happened to be Stalin’s native land.\n\nDespite the general animosity displayed towards him, Sollertinsky’s career seemed hardly affected. He continued his duties at the Philharmonic. In addition, he was invited to join the Leningrad Conservatory and the Institute of Theatre and Music. Sollertinsky was a brilliant lecturer, and his printed oeuvre is rather small, though important. His rich background in philology and theatre arts enabled him to discuss music in a large context, encompassing the inter-relationship of the arts. Sollertinsky died in Novosibirsk in 1944, at the age of forty-one. Shostakovich dedicated his Piano Trio Op. 67 to the memory of his friend.\n\nThe career of Alexander Rabinovich was also cut short by premature death at the age of forty-three, in 1943. His particular interests included the music of Mahler, Richard Strauss, and Stravinsky, which exposed him to attacks during the critical year 1936. His defensive statement did not satisfy the editors of the journal Sovetskaya Muzyka who branded his ideas as nonsensical. This applied particularly to Rabinovich’s thesis that there were two types of formalism—“conservative” and “innovational”, of which the latter was allegedly “more dangerous”. Among the few published works of Rabinovich, the most important is a slim volume, Russian Opera prior to Glinka, considered a pioneering work in its field; it was published posthumously in 1948.\n\nMikhail Druskin, the youngest of the “formalist trio”, was trained as a pianist and showed a predilection for the modern repertoire. In 1928, at the age of twenty-three, he published a remarkable first book, New Piano Music, for which his teacher Asafiev wrote a preface. Some of Druskin’s statements must have startled the tradition-minded: thus, he described Schoenberg’s Opus 25 as a “sample of highest mastery, placing this work on a level with the best polyphonic achievements of J. S. Bach.” He also gave enthusiastic endorsement to the piano music of Hindemith and Stravinsky, calling the latter’s Piano Rag Music “the turning point in piano literature” and “the gospel of modern rhythm”.32 Druskin’s booklet on Petrushka, published in 1935—at a time when Stravinsky was already under attack by the Soviets—is still laudatory though more reserved. For the witch-hunters of 1936, Druskin was a welcome target but he defended himself with skill. Today, Druskin is a major figure in Soviet musicology, a professor of music history at the Leningrad Conservatory, and an authority on Western music as well as the Russian revolutionary song. He has lost none of his interest in modern music; in 1962, he was reported to be at work on a biography of Anton Webern.\n\nDuring the debates at the Composers’ Union, the names of a few other musicians were drawn in—the composers Mossolov, Popov, and Litinsky. But the over-riding issue of the 1936 controversy was, not the fate of any individual composers, but the issue of musical modernism and its status within Soviet music. True, there is never any direct censure of modernism: it is always referred to as “formalism”, for modernism and formalism are not synonymous in Soviet usage. Soviet critics often stress the “progressive” nature of the Socialist-Realist type of “modern” music, as contrasted to the decadence of Western-style dabbling in modernism. Formalism—officially defined as the “separation of form from content”—is a term to be used with care, as one can read in an authoritative Soviet encyclopedia, “Formalism must not be confused with individualized original creativity, genuine innovations in terms of form as well as content, which constitute an indispensable trait of valuable realist art.”33\n\nThe Resolution of 1932 considered formalism a dead issue, for its entire weight is directed against proletarian factionalism. Indeed, the anti-modernist campaign of RAPM in the years 1929-32 had routed the advanced musical forces. But the issue of formalism smouldered below the surface. In 1934, the journal Sovetskaya Muzyka published an article “Against Formalism in Music” in which the allegedly formalistic works by Litinsky were taken as a pretext to caatigate all unnecessary complexity in music. The author was the critic Ostretsov who, paradoxically, found himself on the defensive in 1936 because he had praised Lady Macbeth.\n\nPravda’s anti-Shostakovich article of 1936, “Chaos Instead of Music”, had far-reaching implications: it was meant as a warning not only to music, but also to literature and the other arts. Yet, to Pravda’s pained surprise, other publications did not immediately join the campaign. Three weeks later there was some prodding in Pravda, “It is with surprise that we note that the Literary Journal treated the editorials in Pravda as an affair apart from literature, and even uninteresting. The paper has not carried a word of comment... In the same blissful state of ignorance are also the other newspapers. Izvestia is silent. The usually energetic Komsomolskaya Pravda is in the same position. Is it possible that these papers have nothing to say?”34\n\nEventually, the arts were blanketed with conformity. In the visual arts, we witness a dreary revival of academicism with a stress on representational realism. In the theatre, the experimentalism of Meyer-hold and Alexander Taïrov came under attack and their theatres were soon to be closed. In literature, sycophantism became an art practised by opportunist writers. Alexei Tolstoy, an author of stature, is reported by the painter Annenkov as saying, “I am simply a cynic ... I am an ordinary mortal who wants to live ... I don’t give a damn; I’ll write whatever is wanted. If he (Stalin) wants Ivan the Terrible and Rasputin rehabilitated and turned into learned Marxists, I don’t care.”35\n\nBut it was music that captured the international headlines. Shostakovich became a test-case—the “first clear demonstration of what Communist totalitarianism in art meant”.36\n\nWhat was the effect of the 1936 censure on the creative development of Shostakovich? This question has been discussed repeatedly by Soviet and by Western authors. Generally speaking, the Soviets maintain that Shostakovich benefited by the public criticism, while Western critics feel that his talent suffered permanent damage and was stunted at a sensitive point of its natural evolution. Recently, both sides have withdrawn from their extreme positions. Since the Soviet rehabilitation of Lady Macbeth in 1963, Shostakovich’s opera has been declared an undisputed masterpiece, and much of the original criticism of Pravda has become obsolete. In the Western camp, an article in the British music journal Tempo (1966) found that Shostakovich’s musical idiom underwent a salutary clarification after the 1936 castigation. These findings were based on an analytical comparison between his Fourth Symphony of 1935-36 and his Fifth Symphony of 1937. Both are pivotal works; the Fourth, withdrawn by the composer prior to its première in 1936 and the Fifth, a “creative reply to just criticism”. In the opinion of the British critic of Tempo, this work of “repentence” is “more convincingly and profoundly original than the one whose ‘excesses’ it was meant to atone for” (namely the Fourth).37\n\nTo what extent did Shostakovich have to “repent”? It is wrong to picture him as a misunderstood rebel oppressed by an inimical regime. Even at the height of his involvement with modernism—around 1927-31—he never thought of challenging Marxist-Leninist aesthetics. He made this clear in an interview granted to The New York Times in December 1931,\n\n“There can be no music without ideology . . . We, as revolutionaries, have a different conception of music. Lenin himself said that ‘music is a means of unifying broad masses of people’. It is not a leader of masses, perhaps, but certainly an organizing force! For music has the power of stirring specific emotions . . . Even the symphonic form, which appears more than any other divorced from literary elements, can be said to have a bearing on politics . . . Music is no longer an end in itself, but a vital weapon in the struggle. Because of this, Soviet music will probably develop along different lines from any the world has ever known.”38\n\nIt is important to remember that Shostakovich never posed as an “ivory tower” artist nor as a misunderstood futurist. He had a vital need to communicate with his audiences and with his performers, and nothing seemed to frighten him more than a possible alienation from his surroundings. This might explain his apparent submissiveness to official criticism. He said in 1931, “I consider that every artist who isolates himself from the world is doomed. I find it incredible that an artist should want to shut himself away from the people who, in the end, form his audience. I think an artist should serve the greatest possible number of people. I always try to make myself understood as widely as possible, and, if I don’t succeed, I consider it my own fault.”39\n\nAs early as 1931, Shostakovich considered some of his older works a bit “old-fashioned”, meaning in the Russian sense too sharply revolutionary. “A children’s disease of the Left Wing” he described some of his earlier theories. From this point of view, he called his October Symphony (No. 2, 1927) “not entirely successful”. Undoubtedly, Asafiev was right in saying that Lady Macbeth, composed in 1930-32, showed Shostakovich on a musical path leading away from his earlier modem eccentricities. The whole Pravda attack on Shostakovich appears in retrospect a stupid, misinformed, ill-timed blunder. Yet, one can also admit another point of view, as for example that of the editor of Tempo, “... It is possible to understand, if not condone, the moral indignation and censure once aroused by the blatant heartlessness and sardonic ‘objectivity’ of the music (to Lady Macbeth), and to feel that a deeper emotional involvement was desirable ... though it is also true that the Fourth Symphony almost bursts at the seams with feeling . . The pattern of Shostakovich’s career, remarks the same editor, is that of the “daring young man, who is suddenly checked by doubts, and sobers up” though his doubts were “forced on him by extra-musical criticism”.40\n\nObviously, the evolution from “sardonicism” to “emotional involvement” took place within Shostakovich as a matter of course, without outside prodding, during the three-four years that separate Lady Macbeth from the Fourth Symphony, for he worked on the Fourth during 1935 and 1936, before and after the Pravda attack. The decision to withdraw the Fourth Symphony from the planned performance was not a spontaneous act. The symphony was put into rehearsal by the Leningrad Philharmonic under the German conductor Fritz Stiedry, a man well disposed towards Shostakovich. Several rehearsals were held before the composer, apparently discouraged by the reaction of the orchestra and various listeners, decided to cancel the première. He must have felt instictively that the Fourth Symphony was not the kind of work expected of him at that critical juncture of his career. What was expected and needed, was not a work of turbulence and involvement, but a work of clarity and affirmation. Thus, the score of the Fourth Symphony was put aside for twenty-five years.* Unbowed, Shostakovich concentrated on a new symphony, the Fifth, which was first played on 21 November 1937 to triumphal acclaim. It re-established Shostakovich at the top of his generation—the success was a full vindication—and it brought him world-wide praise, though with some intermingled reservations. The next few years added lustre to Shostakovich’s fame; the First String Quartet, the Sixth Symphony, various film scores, and particularly the Piano Quintet Op. 57 (1940) which brought him a Stalin Prize. He had reclaimed his position, and he kept it until 1948, when the next storm broke.\n\nTurning from musical controversies to the positive aspects of Soviet musical life, one must mention the Dekadas of national art introduced in 1936. These were ten-day festivals, each dedicated to the arts of one of the Soviet republics, opera and ballet, art and folk music, orchestras, composers, and performers. Co-ordinated with the performing arts were exhibits of painting and sculpture. The main Dekadas took place in Moscow though other capital cities planned similar events. From 1936 to 1941, ten Festivals were presented, showing the arts of the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, Armenia, Byelorussia, Buriat-Mongolia, and Tadzhikistan. After a ten-year interruption due to war and post-war conditions, the Dekadas were resumed in 1951 on a broader scale, including literature as well as the performing and visual arts.\n\nNeedless to say, the Dekadas served political as well as artistic purposes. They demonstrated the success of the Communist policy towards the nationalities with its stress on cultural autonomy—the development of national cultures within a Socialist society.\n\nArtistically, the Dekadas were immensely valuable, both for the visitors and the Muscovites. To be evaluated by a sophisticated metropolitan public was a challenge for the visiting ensembles, while the Moscow hierarchy welcomed the opportunity to gain first-hand information about the cultural climate in the provinces. In developing national cultures, there were unavoidable frictions between local factions: the so-called local bourgeois nationalists resisted the Russian influence and preferred the preservation of what the Russians called condescendingly “national archaism”. Some regions had old musical traditions worthy of preservations, as for example the Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. But there were also regions where, before the Soviet era, no written musical documentation had existed, where the reliance was on oral traditions. Schooled composers were brought to these regions to teach musical notation and theory, and there were frequent controversies as to how much to preserve, how much to modernize. In the process, some of the old traditions undoubtedly became lost or distorted; often a compromise had to be reached. The Russian composers and scholars made genuine efforts to preserve the folklore, the national traditions of singing and playing folk instruments. As soon as native musicians were ready to assume the cultural leadership, they took over. A certain degree of Russification was unavoidable, particularly since all conservatories in the Soviet Union had to follow a unified curriculum. Among Russian composers who worked and taught systematically in remote sections of the Soviet Union were Glière, Vassilenko, Vlassov, Feré, Roslavetz, and Ippolitov-Ivanov.\n\nIn addition to these national Dekadas, there were also “all-Union” festivals of Soviet music, extended to two-month surveys of musical accomplishments. The first such festival, in celebration of the Twentieth Anniversary of the Revolution, was held in 1937 in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and Tbilisi. The second, in 1938, was expanded to thirty cities, with some 600 concerts which stressed exchanges of performers between the republics. The third and fourth festivals, in 1939 and 1940, were done on a truly national scale, with concerts in every urban centre of the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile the Dekadas and festivals stressed mainly professional performers, the musical Olympiads were dedicated to amateur musicians. The first such Olympiad assembled in Leningrad on 13 June 1927, when 5,000 amateur musicians met at the Communist Youth Stadium. There was a chorus of 2,000, many bands and folk instrument ensembles. To create musical outlets for laymen was a prime concern during the early revolutionary years, and Leningrad in particular had many organizations devoted to group singing, folk instrument ensembles, and similar activities. Each succeeding year saw an Olympiad with an ever growing number of participants (up to 100,000) and increasingly sophisticated musical programmes, including pieces by Glière, Shostakovich, Knipper, and Dzerzhinsky. After the Tenth Olympiad in 1936, a temporary halt was called. The next Olympiad, planned for 1941, was cancelled because of the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nOther cities followed the Leningrad example. Moscow had an all-Union Olympiad of national theatres in 1930, and one for amateur artists in 1932. The first all-Ukrainian Olympiad took place in Kharkov in 1931, and critical observers from abroad were impressed by the spontaneity and elemental strength of massed performances by nonprofessionals. The unifying force of such musical gatherings had already been recognized during the French Revolution when virtually the entire population of Paris would assemble on the Champs de Mars to join in revolutionary festivities.\n\nThe establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1933 led to a thaw in artistic relations. Actually, the musical contacts had never been completely severed; such journals as Modern Music published regular reports on Soviet music written by its Moscow correspondent, the critic Victor Belayev and others. In 1935, The New York Times sent a special correspondent, Howard Taubman, to the Soviet capital, and his sympathetic survey of the musical scene was published in three major articles, during August and September of that year. But the Soviet people knew little about what was happening in American music. That lacuna was filled in July 1934, when Sovetskaya Muzyka published a major article, “Music in the United States”, by the American composer Henry Cowell. Understandably, the activities of left-wing organizations were stressed in reports from America, as in Elie Siegmeister’s article on New York’s “Composers Collective”.41 The Moscow critic Shneerson began to publish regular summaries on music in America, usually based on material from American journals. In such reports, the seamy side of American musical life was emphasized to create a contrast with the paradisiac state of the arts in the Soviet Union. But good or bad, there was intense interest in Western musical events, and the journal Sovetskaya Muzyka gave considerable space to reports from abroad.\n\nThe 1930’s brought new successes to Soviet performers: they won virtually every international musical contest. The Wieniawski and Chopin competitions in Warsaw, the Pianistic Concours in Vienna, the Ysaye Prize in Brussels—everywhere, Soviet instrumentalists were among the finalists. The prize-winning pianists were Lev Oborin, Yakov Flière, Emil Gilels, and Yakov Zak, while David Oistrakh dominated the violin field. New conductors emerged through national contests, particularly in 1938—Yevgeni Mravinsky, Melik-Pashayev, Rakhlin, Ivanov, all of whom were to reach top positions. Even string quartets competed for prizes, and in 1938 the Armenian Komitas Quartet shared the first prize with the Quartet of the Bolshoi Theatre.\n\nSoviet artists are taught early to be competitive, to be able to perform under stress. Those who are sent abroad to participate in competitions are trained like teams for Olympic events, exposed to trial performances, and prepared both technically and psychologically. The results are astounding, and there is hardly a musical contest in which young Soviet musicians are not among the top winners.\n\nWhile Soviet virtuosi were popular abroad, Soviet music was less readily accepted. Prokofiev, of course, was famous before he acquired the label of “Soviet” composers, and his popularity was undiminished. The works he composed after his return to Moscow in 1933—notably the Suites from Lieutenant Kije and Romeo and Juliet, the Violin Concerto No. 2, Peter and the Wolf—were warmly received and widely played. He continued to make concert tours in Western Europe and the United States, the last in 1938, and his personal appearances stimulated interest in his music.\n\nMiaskovsky, considered a leading personality among Soviet composers during the 1920’s, lost some of his appeal in the West and was more rarely performed. The Symphony of Yuri Shaporin, played in London in 1935, was found to be dull and disappointing. According to Gerald Abraham “. . . There was a curious sense of disillusionment at the discovery that Revolutionary Russia could produce such far from revolutionary music.”42\n\nAmong the young composers Shostakovich was the recognized leader. Though he was often criticized for the occasional flippancy and banality of his musical ideas, each of his new works was received with interest. The controversy surrounding Lady Macbeth gave him a halo of martyrdom in the West, but the opera—despite the momentary flurry of interest—did not become a repertoire piece. When the Fifth Symphony reached Philadelphia in 1939 and London in 1940, it was well received though without the exaggerated huzzas accorded it in Moscow. Other young newcomers who aroused international interest were Dmitri Kabalevsky and Aram Khachaturian.\n\nBut it became clear, during the 1930’s, that the platitudinous music of Socialist Realism was not really exportable. The West was simply not interested in symphonies and cantatas glorifying Lenin, Stalin, and Kirov, the Red Army and the Kolkhoz. What Prokofiev had predicted in 1934 became a reality—Soviet music became “provincial”. The harder Soviet officialdom clamoured for music “Socialist in content, national in form”, the more Soviet music became estranged and isolated from the musical mainstream of the West.\n\nIn one field, however, Soviet music gained quick and uncontested international recognition—music for the cinema. The new medium of sound film attracted Russia’s best composers who were drawn into this field by extraordinarily talented film directors. Most prominent was the collaboration between Prokofiev and Sergei Eisenstein. Prokofiev’s colourful imagination, controlled by a disciplined mind, responded to the challenge of the new medium, to the split-second needs of musical illumination of the moving picture. Eisenstein reminisced, “Prokofiev works like a clock . .. His exactness in time is a by-product of creative exactness . . . His music is amazingly plastic. It is never content to remain an illustration, but everywhere ... it wonderfully reveals the inner movement of the phenomenon.”43\n\nIn 1940, after having completed Alexander Nevsky, Prokofiev wrote, “The cinema is a young and very modern art that offers new and fascinating possibilities to the composer. These possibilities must be fully utilized. Composers ought to make a study of them, instead of merely writing the music and then leaving it to the mercy of the film people. Even the most skilled sound technician cannot possibly handle the music as well as the composer himself . . . Eisenstein’s respect for music was so great that at times he was prepared to cut or add to his sequences so as not to upset the balance of a musical episode.”44\n\nThis unique collaboration produced such film classics as Alexander Nevsky (1938) and Ivan the Terrible (in two parts, 1942-45). Earlier, Prokofiev had written the score to Lieutenant Kije (1933), directed by Feinzimmer.\n\nEvery Soviet composer, major and minor, has done some work for films though few were so fortunate as to have an Eisenstein at their side. Shostakovich said in 1939, “Cinema music is often regarded as a mere illustration, supplementary to the screen. In my opinion, it should be treated as an integral part of an artistic whole.”45\n\nShostakovich’s contact with the film world started early, when, as a seventeen-year-old, he earned a meagre living playing the piano in a cinema. His first film score was actually an accompaniment to the silent film The New Babylon (1928-29), to be played by an orchestra in place of the customary pianist. The following year, he wrote his first sound film, Alone. By 1963, the number of his film scores had reached thirty-two, the last being Hamlet. Shostakovich provided each film score with an opus number and has arranged ten orchestral Suites, each based on one of his films. At times it almost seems as if Shostakovich sought “refuge” in writing film music, particularly after the public castigation suffered in 1948; at that time he was warned not to “retire” completely into the film medium. For films, Shostakovich used an idiom less complex and less inclined towards “formalism” in the Soviet sense because of the subject matter involved. One Soviet biographer wrote in 1959,\n\n“The ideological conceptions underlying such films were the exact opposite of those displayed in The Nose and Lady Macbeth ... Shostakovich’s work ... in the cinema gave him a more correct outlook on life, it enabled him to obtain a more profound understanding of the traits of the Soviet character ... It did much to change his style . . . Under the inspiration of this new work he turned to the so-called mass-genres . . . Shostakovich enjoyed writing songs for his cinema productions. In the early 1930’s Soviet youth throughout the country took up the refrain of his ‘Song of the Young Workers’ from the film The Passer-by, and made it the most popular song of the day.”46\n\nThis contradicts Gerald Abraham’s contention that Shostakovich “cannot write even a moderately good tune”. In fact, Soviet composers have a knack of writing functional music, and they put this gift to good use in their film scores. Among those active in film work during the 1930’s were Kabalevsky, Shebalin, Dunayevsky, Khachaturian, Khrennikov, Dzerzhinsky, Sviridov . . . composers of every hue and conviction. It is safe to say that in no other film-producing country have so many composers of note lent their talents to the film industry. In turn, the peculiar and specific requirements of film music—its adaptability to quick-changing moods, illustrative needs, and concrete realism—have occasionally influenced the “absolute” music of Soviet composers. In the 1920’s the term “cinemafication” of music was coined. A British critic compared the Twelfth (Lenin) Symphony of Shostakovich to a “sound track”. Shchedrin’s Second Symphony of 1963 was likened to music composed for cinematic “frames” because of its rapid changes of moods. Indeed, in listening to some colourful—and not over-profound—Soviet scores, one can easily imagine the sound track of a non-existing moving picture. Certainly, the demands of Socialist Realist aesthetics—concreteness, closeness to life—came nearest to implementation in Soviet film music.\n\nDespite the internal tensions and the threatening international situation, the 1930’s brought constant expansion to the musical life of the Soviet Union. In 1936, Moscow acquired a third symphony orchestra, the USSR State Symphony, which was to function next to the Philharmonic and the Radio Orchestra. The activities of the radio network played an increasingly important role that was emphasized by two gigantic festivals, in 1936 and 1937. The Soviets, always aware of commemorative dates, made the year 1939 into a Mussorgsky anniversary and dedicated 1940 to Tchaikovsky, in both cases celebrating the centenaries of the composers’ births. This meant not only musical festivities but also the publication of documentary materials, letters, scholarly editions, all prepared with painstaking care. The Shostakovich revision of Boris Godunov was planned for the Mussorgsky anniversary though it was not performed until 1959 and did not succeed in displacing the entrenched bowdlerization of Rimsky-Korsakov. Incidentally, it was in 1940, during the Tchaikovsky year, that the Moscow Conservatory was re-named in honour of Tchaikovsky—just as in 1944 the Leningrad Conservatory was re-named in honour of Rimsky-Korsakov, born in 1844.\n\nVisits by foreign artists contributed to the richness of Soviet musical life of the 193o’s. Several conductors, displaced by Hitler’s persecution, received permanent appointments—permanent until the growing xenophobia in Russia made their activity undesirable. Fritz Stiedry was conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic from 1933 to 1937. Georg Sebastian was in charge of the All-Union Radio Orchestra in Moscow from 1931 to 1937. Oscar Fried—who had been the first foreign conductor to visit Russia after the First World War in 1921—settled permanently in the Soviet Union in 1934, acquired Soviet citizenship, and died in Moscow in 1941. Eugene Szenkar led the Moscow Philharmonic from 1934 to 1937. Heinz Unger conducted the Leningrad Radio Orchestra from 1934 to 1936. There was a rumour in 1933 that Arnold Schoenberg might settle in the Soviet Union, though eventually he emigrated to the United States.*\n\nOther artists came for short visits: the pianists Egon Petri, Casadesus, Artur Rubinstein, the violinists Szigeti and Thibaud, the singers Marian Anderson, Ninon Vallin, and Paul Robeson, the cellist Maurice Maréchal, the conductors Ansermet, Kleiber, Klemperer, and Coates. Received with particular enthusiasm were some native Russian virtuosi who had settled abroad before the 1917 Revolution—the violinist Efrem Zimbalist and the incomparable Jascha Heifetz. These two—both former students of the unforgotten Leopold Auer—had carried the glory of Russian violin playing throughout the world. Now, in 1934, they celebrated a unique homecoming.\n\nThe late 193o’s were harsh years for the Soviet people. The Great Purge swept through the country in 1936-38. No one felt safe. “People who had never belonged to any opposition, who were loyal followers of Stalin or honest non-party specialists were arrested. These years came to be known as ‘Yezhovsbchina’,” wrote Ehrenburg in his Memoirs.47 People held Nikolai Yezhov, the head of the dreaded Secret Police 1936-38, responsible for the “senseless violence committed against the Communists, against the Soviet intelligentsia”. Stalin continued to be revered by millions as a “sort of mythical demi-god”. If we are to believe Ehrenburg, he—and many others like him—Meyerhold, Pasternak—were convinced that Stalin knew nothing about the terror. “One night... I met Boris Pasternak ...; he waved his arms about as he stood between the snowdrifts, ‘If only someone would tell Stalin’.” This was in 1938. Ehrenburg, who survived (“how, I shall never know”) told some of the story, “The life we led in those days was quite exceptional... There was no one in the circle of my acquaintance who could be sure about the morrow; many of them kept a small suitcase ... permanently in readiness... I once met Prokofiev at the Club—he played some of his compositions. He was unhappy, even grim, and said to me, ‘Today one must work. Work is the only thing, the only salvation’.”48\n\nAs happens so often in times of extreme stress, the mood of the populace turned towards light entertainment—operettas, popular songs, humorous films were in demand. Dunayevsky and Blanter, composers of light music, rose to renewed fame. After all, “life is easier, life is gayer” was the slogan of Stalin’s regime. The harsh every-day reality was seen through rose-coloured glasses. . . Life of the Soviet people was often presented as a continuous holiday, and the labour of the people as an easy and gay occupation,” writes a Soviet historian in retrospect. All this sailed under the flag of Socialist Realism. “One must admit,” writes the same historian, “that the adaptation of the new method (i.e. Socialist Realism) was complex and controversial. At times, a one-sided inclination towards official parade-like, festively pompous forms was noticeable, often connected with the cult of personality of I. V. Stalin.”49\n\nSomehow, musical creativity continued despite the oppressive mood. New operas and ballets were staged, such as Khrennikov’s Into the Storm (1939), Dzerzhinsky’s Virgin Soil Upturned (1937), Prokofiev’s Semyon Kotko (1940) and his long awaited ballet Romeo and Juliet (1940). During the All-Soviet Music Festival of 1939 (November-December), two historic cantatas aroused fervent patriotic feelings—Shaporin’s On the Field of Kulikovo and Prokofiev’s Alexander Nevsky. Significant new instrumental works were heard—three symphonies by Miaskovsky (Nos. 19, 20, and 21, 1939-40), the Sixth Symphony of Shostakovich (1939), the Violin Concerto of Khachaturian (1940).\n\nIn the meantime, the international situation—deteriorating since Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933—moved inexorably towards a crisis. The German annexation of Austria, the defeat, with German help, of the Spanish Loyalists, the Munich Pact of 1938 and the subsequent dismemberment of Czechoslovakia—all this pointed towards an unavoidable conflict. Anglo-French negotiations with the Soviet Union were dilatory and inconclusive. Memel was annexed by Hitler in March 1939, and a threat to Poland followed immediately. A last-minute “deal” with Hitler was almost certainly at the back of Stalin’s mind in April and May of 1939, in the opinion of Werth and other historians. Yet, when the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact was signed on 23 August 1939, the Soviet population was totally unprepared.\n\nThis is not the place to discuss the “morality” of the Soviet-German pact, “the pact that was also a duel”, as Walter Duranty has said. The Soviet Union gained a breathing spell of twenty-two months, as far as the military confrontation with Germany was concerned. Otherwise, the Soviets were embroiled almost immediately in war-like situations : the occupation of Eastern Poland in September 1939, the bloody Finnish War in 1939-40, the annexation of the Baltic States in the summer of 1940, and the simultaneous move into Rumanian Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Although these were “victories”, they were won not without sacrifice—40,000 Russians died in the brief Finnish War alone. The home front became tense when industrial labour was put on a virtual war basis. Preparedness was the watchword, and it gained “spontaneous” support from workers and state employees.\n\nIn 1940, Ehrenburg returned to Moscow having witnessed the defeats in Spain and France. He was appalled by the lack of concern he found at home, “I went back to Moscow on 29 July. I was convinced that the Germans would soon attack us; the terrible scenes of the exodus from Barcelona and from Paris were still before my eyes. But in Moscow the general mood seemed calm. The press said that friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany had grown stronger.”50\n\nAnother year passed while Yugoslavia and Greece fell to the Germans. By 1941—so Ehrenburg surmises—Stalin had become concerned. Yet, when the blow came on 22 June 1941 the Soviet Union was relatively unprepared. It was Molotov, not Stalin, who told the people over the radio that their country had been invaded by the Germans. In a “faltering, slightly stuttering voice”, Molotov spoke of a “treacherous attack”. Ehrenburg recalls, “We sat for a long time by the radio. Hitler made a speech. Churchill’s speech was relayed. But Moscow was broadcasting gay lighthearted songs which in no way corresponded to the mood of the people. No speeches, no articles had been prepared; they were playing songs . . .”51\n\nThe war for survival had begun.\n\n* In 1957, the name was changed to Soyuz Kompozitorov S S S R (Union of Composers of the USSR). See pp. 399–400, 472.\n\n* It was generally assumed that Prokofiev remained a Soviet citizen throughout the years abroad. However, Nestyev’s first American biography of Prokofiev (1946, never published in Russian) states, “One of the first steps Prokofiev took upon reaching his homeland in 1927 was to take Soviet citizenship.”11 It proves that Prokofiev must have obtained some non-Soviet travel document prior to 1927. This sentence was suppressed in Nestyev’s later Russian biography of Prokofiev (1957).\n\n* Delayed by thirty years, the première took place in 1966. See pp. 465-6.\n\n* The three members, whom Taubman interviewed, were the composers Veprik and Kabalevsky, and the musicologist Shneerson. They pointed out that after the Resolution of 1932, “democratic tendencies” prevailed in music.\n\n** A narrator was used before each act to tell the story. These were semi-staged concert performances.\n\n* Actually, Glinka’s original name for his opera was Ivan Susanin; the change to A Life for the Tsar was made at the behest of Tsar Nicholas I prior to the première in 1836. The revised libretto stresses Susanin’s love for his homeland while minimizing his monarchic allegiance. An earlier attempt to provide Glinka’s score with a completely new libretto (under the title Hamme r and Sickle, 1924) was a complete failure.\n\n* The theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold, with whom Shostakovich had worked on several occasions, was still active in 1936, though under attack. He was arrested in 1939 and died in 1942.\n\n* See pp. 232-3.\n\n* See pp. 79-80.\n\n* * Asafiev was co-editor, with Paul Lamm, of the Academic Edition of Mussorgsky.\n\n* * * In 1927, Asafiev had written a number of articles on Wozzeck in conjunction with the Leningrad premiere of the work. He was also co-editor of a booklet entitled Alban Berg’s Wozzeck.\n\n*See p. 42.\n\n* One could draw a parallel between the twenty-five year delay of Shostakovich’s Fourth Symphony and the delay in publication of the second part of the novel Virgin Soil Upturned by Sholokhov; the first part of the novel was brought out in 1932, the second was actually ready in 1936 but not published for twenty-five years. The première of Shostakovich’s Fourth took place on 30 December 1961.\n\n*See p. 427."
