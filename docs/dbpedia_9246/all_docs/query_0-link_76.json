        "text": "Viktor Orbán compared Hungary’s EU membership to the Soviet occupation of his country during a speech on Monday commemorating the anniversary of Hungary’s 1956 uprising against Soviet rule.\n\n“Today, things pop up that remind us of the Soviet times. Yes, it happens that history repeats itself,” Orbán said in the city of Veszprem, local media reported. “Fortunately, what once was tragedy is now a comedy at best. Fortunately, Brussels is not Moscow. Moscow was a tragedy. Brussels is just a bad contemporary parody.”\n\n“We had to dance to the tune that Moscow whistled, Brussels whistles too, but we dance as we want to, and if we don’t want to, then we don’t dance,” Orbán added.\n\nThe speech mirrors Orbán’s words from this time last year, when he suggested that the EU would end up like the Soviet Union."
