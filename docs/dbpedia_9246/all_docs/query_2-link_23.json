Or at least it appears that way nowadays because the line of what’s “offensive” keeps changing. The acceptable phrase of today is banished tomorrow.\n\nIt’s a confusing new problem. Although, this isn’t exactly the case; the issue has existed for at least a hundred years.\n\nIt was everyday life after the revolution in Russia and China. According to blogger Rob Henderson in his piece mentioned above, there was such thing as a “correct opinion,” and it shifted constantly on purpose.\n\nThis was the birth of political correctness. According to Henderson:\n\n“The term “political correctness” was first used in 1917 by Marxist-Leninist devotees following the Russian Revolution. It was used to describe adherence to the policies and principles of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In other words, the party line.”"
