        "meta_description": "This article traces the history of US and Soviet reconnaissance satellites during the Cold War. It fills the gap in historiography of the Space Race that has inadequately studied military space programs and focused largely on civilian spaceflight, with the Apollo Moon landings being a prime example. It argues that the military satellites employed by both the US and Soviets offered unprecedented amounts of information on the other side and eliminated the issue of lacking intelligence that characterized the early Cold War. This in turn allowed for a more peaceful coexistence between these two ideologically opposed superpowers. Spy satellites allowed for a better assessment of the other side’s military strength, created a system of early warning for nuclear attacks, and offered a non-invasive way of verifying arms control treaties. These reconnaissance satellites and their successors play this important role up to this day.",

        "text": "1 Thomas Heppenheimer, The Space Shuttle Decision, (Washington, D.C.: NASA History Office, 1998), 191 (...)\n\nWe’ve spent $35 or $40 billion on the space program. And if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge that we gained from space photography, it would be worth ten times what the whole program has cost. Because tonight we know how many missiles the enemy has.\n\n—Lyndon B. Johnson\n\n1. Introduction\n\n4I thus aim to answer the question: what role did the Space Race play in the global security competition between the US and the USSR? I argue that the technologies and legal precedents that were born out of the early developments of the Space Race stabilized the Cold War security competition. The dawn of orbital technologies and the freedom of space precedent established by early space missions allowed for the development of reconnaissance satellites. These satellites provided information that played a critical role in changing Americans’ perception of the USSR. The developments in spaceflight provided a solution to the issue of lacking intelligence and allowed for a less belligerent stance towards the communist empire. Spy satellites contributed to the stability of US-USSR relations by providing information on the opposing side’s intentions and capabilities, creating early warning systems for nuclear attacks, and by providing a reliable method of verifying compliance with arms limitation treaties in a non-invasive manner. This article argues that the development of a system of mutual invigilation from orbit during the Space Race in the 1960s had a profound impact on US conduct of the Cold War. By providing unprecedented levels of transparency, this system supplied both sides of the conflict with invaluable information that eased the tensions and paved the way for détente.\n\n6I present a narrative of how the developments in spaceflight were harnessed for national security purposes in the form of intelligence gathering, which then considerably limited the destabilizing factor of uncertainty in the relations between the US and the USSR. Using declassified documents produced by the US intelligence community in the late 1950s and 1960s and combining them with extant scholarship from the fields of history and international relations, I outline the creation of the first US intelligence satellites. I begin by tracing the history of intelligence gathering against the Soviet Union and describe its early deficiencies. I show how specific events and the inadequacies of early intelligence solutions fueled the need to turn to the different legal and technological developments made as part of the Space Race. I trace the development of the first two US satellite reconnaissance programs, Corona and Midas. I elucidate how and why they were created and discuss how their success in delivering intelligence allowed for a different approach to the Cold War by the United States. Lastly, I integrate this historical narrative with international relations theory. In order to show the impact of satellite intelligence on superpower security competition in the anarchical international system, I discuss the spy satellites in the context of transparency, deterrence and mutuality of surveillance.\n\n7Even though the Soviet Union developed space systems analogous to those of the US, the information about them available today is very scarce, as Russian archives still remain mostly classified. Therefore, this article focuses on studying the history of US space-based intelligence assets, with only brief mentions of their Soviet counterparts. The topic is relevant still today, as space-based intelligence systems that are based upon the developments of the early spaceflight era are still in use today, and they play an important role in stabilizing security competition between modern powers.\n\n2. The Early Cold War and Information Scarcity\n\n3. History of Overhead Reconnaissance: From Reconnaissance Balloons to Spy Satellites\n\n18In the meantime, the CIA’s U-2 spy planes finally took off and proved successful in gathering intelligence. Even though Soviet radars were able to detect and track the plane, thanks to its unique design, the U-2 plane flew too high for interception by fighter planes and surface-to-air missiles. Despite knowing very well of the violations of its own airspace and fearing the humiliation of its air defense troops, the USSR never officially acknowledged or protested these intrusions. Soviet silence on the matter and no attacks on U-2 planes allowed the US to conduct safe overflights of various parts of the USSR and relatively safe acquisition of photographs of Soviet military installations.\n\n4. Corona and Midas—An Intelligence Success\n\n5. Spy Satellites and Stability of the International System\n\n39Figure 1: US military spending as percentage of GDP in the 60s.

This article has shown how spaceflight was employed for national security purposes, which in turn mitigated the lack of trust resulting from insufficient intelligence. The volatile history of overhead intelligence gathering culminated in the creation of reconnaissance satellites. These satellites resolved some of the most pressing issues of the early Cold War resulting from the anarchical nature of the international system. The lack of solid intelligence on the Soviet Union led to the proliferation of false data and exaggerated numbers on the armed forces of the communist empire along with fear of Soviet aggression. Since uncertainty about the opponent’s capabilities and intentions is considered one of the most destabilizing factors in the international system, the Cold War was characterized by tension, uncertainty, and considerable threat of a global war prior to the creation of the system of mutual monitoring from space,.\n\n49Early attempts at aerial reconnaissance did not offer a solution to the problem. The Genetrix balloons were an outright failure, and technical limitations of the U-2 airplanes, together with the illegal nature of their missions, proved the program to be inadequate. But the successful launches of Sputnik-1 in 1957 and Explorer-1 in 1958 opened the door to space surveillance. Thanks to the precedent set by Sputnik, space became an international domain. This allowed for intelligence gathering without the threat of loss of life and practically eliminated the risk of sparking a conflict while gathering intelligence. The subsequent creation of the Corona satellites finally delivered the much-needed information about the Soviet adversary. The satellites not only quickly provided more useful data than the U-2 program, but also reassured the American decision-makers that there was, in fact, no Soviet strategic advantage. This, in turn, allowed for a decrease in military spending and a cooling down of the arms race. The unprecedented levels of transparency allowed for informed decision-making and directly addressed the security dilemma. The Midas early warning satellite program and its successor, DSP, further allowed the easing of tensions. The possibility of immediate detection of ICBM launches allowed policymakers to once and for all eschew their ideas of preventive war and to instead focus on deterrence and, in the worst case scenario, preemption. Moreover, spy satellites paved the way for arms limitation treaties, as they provided both sides with non-invasive and legal methods of verifying compliance. The mutuality of space surveillance further contributed to the stability of the international system. None of those successes could have taken place without the technological and legal developments of the early spaceflight era."
