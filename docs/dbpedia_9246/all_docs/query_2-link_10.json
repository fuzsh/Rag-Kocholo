        "text": "MARXISM IS THE BEST EXPLANATION FOR THE DEMISE OF THE SOVIET UNION AND 20th CENTURY SOCIALISM\n\nThree broad reasons provided by capitalist western nations for the downfall of the Soviet Union offer only partial explanations.\n\nCan Marxism account for the defeat of 20th century socialism? If Marxism cannot do this and do it well, then it seems to me that, in the present tense, it should have little “significance” to speak of.\n\nWe are not here interested in what Marx or Engels happened to have said at this or that time in their careers; after all, Marx had not always been a Marxist. Rather, we are interested in a Marxist perspective on events of the last century, a perspective informed by a long line of thinkers since Marx and Engels.\n\nWhatever the strengths of the objections and responses though, the fact remains that there is no argument like failure. Rightly or wrongly, the prestige of Marxism has been tied up with “really existing socialism” in Soviet Russia and its satellites.\n\nMore than 50 years before the fall of the Wall, [Leon] Trotsky argued that a privileged and despotic bureaucracy had taken control of the state machinery of the Soviet Union, thereby controlling the productive resources of the country. The Soviet Union was still a workers’ state, Trotsky wrote, because the bureaucracy constituted a stratum rather than a class properly speaking.\n\nSocialism I take to be workers’ power, the state power of workers as a class. As I use the word, then, socialism is synonymous with the term dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nCold war victors have propagated three explanations of the demise of the Soviet Union: (a) The huddled masses of Russia and the Captive Nations yearned to be free in Milton Friedman’s sense of the word, namely, to be able to engage in a wider range of voluntary exchanges with other individuals ... (b) Soviet socialism lost the economic competition with free-market capitalism … (c) Soviet socialism conflicted with human nature.\n\nThis picture, at first sight so incontrovertible, begins to buckle under the weight of sceptical scrutiny … if it really were the case that Soviet “totalitarianism” imploded because it withheld freedom from its people, then why haven’t more rigid regimes, in say Egypt, Burma, or Saudi Arabia, similarly collapsed?\n\nLet us remind ourselves, however, that even during the infamous “period of stagnation,” when patronage, corruption, and inefficiency infused the Soviet economy from top to bottom, it was still delivering bread, jobs, pensions, and basic medical attention to the larger part of the population.\n\nBy contrast, 20 years of capitalism in Russia have denied these things to millions of Russians. A generation has passed two decades of transcontinental impoverishment, falling life expectancies and birth rates, soaring unemployment and infant mortality, a near-catastrophic fall in population, and a raging epidemic of self-administered alcohol poisoning.\n\n[W]hy have Russians remained so quiescent in the post-Soviet era, after 20 years of much worse failure on the part of Russia’s new autocrats?\n\nOne possible response might be that Russians have not yet lost the habit of passivity that they had acquired during the Soviet decades, even as they have acquired the habit of rejecting out-of-hand anything smacking of collectivism.\n\nSince the 1970s, more and more Soviet citizens in positions of power had come to view the property relations characteristic of the old order as fetters on the further development of the productive forces.\n\nBecause a socialist system or any command economy must curtail individual freedom, and because it will fail to satisfy universal needs as well as the rival capitalist system, socialism cannot long endure, at least on a large scale.\n\nThe most strident opposition ... was composed, at least until late in the day, of Party apparatchiks and insiders, managers of large state enterprises, and a range of professional intellectuals, celebrities, and other notables. By that time, it had become obvious to many of the most powerful and well-connected elites that private ownership in the means of production would permit them to amass fortunes and to secure the smooth, systematic transmission of wealth and privilege to their sons.\n\nPerestroika partially opened the floodgates to extra-legal capitalist enterprise on a larger scale, and privatisation enabled upstart magnates to grab up the productive assets and the natural resources of the state and cooperative enterprises.\n\n[I]f an ascendant capitalist class had been forming within the body politic of the USSR long before the August 1991 coup attempt—then the ubiquitous metaphor of a collapse is misleading: the Soviet Union did not collapse, at least not politically. Rather, what took place in 1991 or 1989 or some time earlier, was the bursting of an integument of one kind or another. The integument, however, was as much political as it was economic.\n\nA capitalist class-in-formation rose to power, but Russia’s return to capitalism differed in many respects from the bourgeois revolutions of the early modern period.\n\nIronically, then, one of the reasons why Marxism is significant today is because it provides the best available explanation for the demise of the Soviet Union and the defeat of socialism in the 20th century.\n\nClick here to read the article.\n\nTHE SO-CALLED “SOVIET SOCIALISM” WAS NEITHER SOVIET NOR SOCIALISM\n\nIf there was no socialism, there cannot be any question of the “defeat” of socialism.\n\nThe victorious outcome of the workers’ self-emancipatory revolution is the socialist society, an “association of free individuals”—individuals neither personally dependent as in pre-capitalism nor objectively or materially dependent as in capitalism—which is a classless society.\n\nWith the disappearance of classes, there is also no political power, no state, and so no “workers’ state” either in the new society (Marx 1965: 136; Marx and Engels 1979: x 77).\n\n[T]he conquest of political power by the proletariat is not the end of the proletarian revolution, it constitutes, in fact, only the “first step (erste Shritt) in the revolution” (Manifesto) which continues through a prolonged period till the capitalist mode of production is replaced by the “associated mode of production,” the basis of socialism.\n\nThis is the “revolutionary transformation period between capitalist and communist society” during which the proletariat exercises its dictatorship (Gotha critique, our emphasis). Marx reminded Bakunin (1874-75) that during this period capital as a relation (hence the proletariat) is still not eliminated (1973: 630). Hence, by definition, proletarian dictatorship cannot be “synonymous” with socialism.\n\n[T]he so-called “soviet socialism” was neither soviet nor socialism. It was not “soviet” simply because the soviets in the original sense of independent organs of the labouring people’s self-rule went out of existence within a few months of the Bolshevik victory (Serge 2001: 834). And it would be impossible to demonstrate that there was at any time “socialism” in Marx’s (self) emancipatory sense an association of free individuals—in that country.\n\nOn the contrary, it was a régime where—to invert Tagore’s expression—the “mind was full of fear and the head held low” … if there was no socialism, there could also not be any question of the “defeat” of socialism.\n\nIn October 1917, the fate of over 170 million people was decided by a handful of non-proletarian radicalised intelligentsia—far removed from the site of the real process of production and exploitation, unelected and un-revocable by and totally unaccountable to the labouring people at large.\n\nThe destruction of the labouring people’s self-governing organs by the (single) Party power settled once and for all the question of the existence of a “workers’ state” in Russia, as affirmed by MM [Markar Melkonian] uncritically following the claim of the régime’s rulers.\n\nWe should stress that bureaucracy was further strengthened by the total absence of free elections after the last and freest countrywide election to the constituent assembly in early 1918 and the “denial of the right to exist to all the dissidents of the revolution beginning 1919” (Serge 2001: 832).\n\nWorking in the same direction was the introduction of press censorship and prohibition of newspapers and periodicals critical of the regime. What a contrast with the 1871 Commune!\n\nIndeed, soon began the mass disenchantment and unrest among the workers. After the initial feeling of triumph, mass dissatisfaction of the working people was followed by open conflict, repression of the mass protests, and at an “extraordinary” meeting of the delegates from 15 major metalworking plants of Petrograd at the beginning of April 1918, the Bolsheviks were denounced for “assaulting workers’ movement with the tsarist methods” (Rosenberg in Kaiser 1987: 119).\n\nThere was, however, one place— Kronstadt—whose working people understood better than elsewhere the nature of the new power which in their eyes had turned out to be a Party dictatorship going back on the Party’s earlier October and pre-October promises. Thoroughly disillusioned, they rose against the Party power with the slogan “all power to the soviets, not to parties,” and “down with counter-revolution of the Right and the Left.”\n\n[O]n the completely false charge of collaboration with the Whites, the movement was bloodily suppressed. Thus ended “a bustling, self-governing Soviet democracy the like of which had not been seen in Europe since the Paris Commune,” wrote the unmatched historian of Kronstadt, Israel Getzler (1983: 246). Such, then, was the “workers’ state” in Russia even under Lenin, long before the “oriental despot” came to power.\n\nClick here to read the article.\n\nIT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO QUIBBLE OVER WHETHER THERE WAS A CLASS RULING IN THE USSR IN THE 1980S\n\nIf Marxism and historical materialism have become disconnected from political action then they are doomed to insignificance in the real world of social struggles.\n\nHow did historical materialism enable the ruling party (the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) to steer the country towards the restoration of capitalism?\n\nWhy did the Soviet proletariat not resist and prevent the legal transition to capitalism in 1992?\n\nIf we define class as “a social group, composed of members with a common position with respect to the control of the distribution of the surplus, and who pass on these positions to their offspring” we can see that the transition was carried out in the USSR by a class who already was wielding this kind of economic and political power.\n\nLegal ownership of means of production is only one of the institutions for controlling distribution. Control over access to education, control over taxation and public expenditure, control over social security policies are other effective instruments for distributing the surplus.\n\nIt is superfluous to quibble over whether there was a class ruling in the USSR in the 1980s, or whether there was a “class-in-the-making” (p 35). Nepotism among the nomenklatura and their blatant economic privileges were the norm in the USSR already under Leonid Brezhnev.\n\nThe ruling class in the USSR and the class social formation there may not have an established name in Marxist theory. This does not disprove that the USSR (under Brezhnev at the latest) had evolved into a class society; it only shows that Marxists still refuse to apply historical materialism to the study of the USSR.\n\nMarxists have been unable to observe classes in non-European social formations (Indian, Ottoman, Chinese, etc) because of the fixation on defining classes by the ownership of the means of production. Defining classes by their position in the control over the surplus is sufficient to recognise classes both in capitalist and non-capitalist class social formations.\n\nTo return to the issue: The proposition that classes are to be diagnosed by their position with respect to ownership of the means of production was the very tool used to blind the working people in the USSR to their subjugation and exploitation. The USSR officially held that it was a classless society, because there was no private property in the means of production.\n\nAs long as Marxism is fixated on economic exploitation based on property relations, and ignores other forms of exploitation and the various forms of oppression in hierarchical social structures (whether it be in the family, in trade unions, in state bureaucracies or in communist parties) it cannot explain why working people in the USSR did not resist its dismantling.\n\nIf Marxism and historical materialism have become as disconnected from political action as the above conception and the consequent post-mortem—implies, then they are doomed to insignificance in the real world of social struggles.\n\nClick here to read the article.\n\nI DID NOT WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THE USSR WAS EVER A CLASSLESS SOCIETY\n\nTerminological disagreements are not unusual among Marxists and communists, and are a reflection of a deeper malaise.\n\nWithout conceding that my use of these terms is at odds with Marx’s frequent usage, I wish to point out that Marx and Engels did not use these terms in the same way throughout their careers and in all contexts. In one context, for example, they described communism as “the riddle of history solved” (1844), while in another context it designated a social order which, once achieved, would inaugurate the “real history” of our species.\n\nThis is especially the case in view of the fact that Marx had remarkably little to say about the post-capitalist future.\n\nWhat Chattopadhyay might call “the higher form of socialism,” Lenin called “the higher form of communism,” or simply “communism.” A perusal of one or two high-traffic online dictionaries of Marxism might be enough to make the case that, if there is anything like a prevailing usage by Marxists near and far, then I come close to it.\n\nChattopadhyay’s remarks bolster my claim that the term dictatorship of the proletariat is synonymous with socialism. Chattopadhyay avoids this conclusion only because he ascribes a less familiar meaning to the word socialism.\n\n[A]ccording to Chattopadhyay, Marx is supposed to have held that political revolution will inaugurate (a) a more prolonged revolutionary phase of proletarian dictatorship, followed by (b) the lower stage of communism or socialism, and then, eventually, (c) the higher stage of communism. According to my preferred vocabulary, by contrast, political revolution will hopefully inaugurate (a) proletarian dictatorship or socialism, which then in the fullness of time will segue into (b) communism—that is to say, a social order in which classes and the workers’ state have disappeared and the communist mode of production prevails.\n\nThe Soviet Union, Chattopadhyay writes, was neither soviet nor socialist … I do not entirely disagree with these claims, but the interpretation strikes me as excessively one-sided. Here I wish only to register two observations:\n\nOn the eve of the October Revolution, Lenin viewed Russia as the weak link in the chain of imperialism, a link which if shattered would set loose revolutionary forces in the industrialised west … After the defeat of the revolutions in the West, and finding themselves economically decimated, embargoed, besieged and invaded, dire circumstances forced Lenin and the Bolsheviks to hunker down, switch gears, and pivot, in an attempt to salvage something of the revolution.\n\nSurely these considerations should inform our evaluation of Lenin.\n\nCem Somel appears to believe that I hold that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was at some point a classless society … I probably contributed to the confusion by inadequately defining a class as a social group “composed of members with a common relationship to ownership and control of the means of production” (p 36, note 5). Somel’s definition [of class] is more clear and concise than my formulation above, and it is more accurate than my definition in the post-mortem article.\n\nSomel is on target, too, when he writes that a correct definition of a class will allow us to see that the transition to capitalism was carried out in the USSR by a social group that had already wielded economic and political power. This group included high party functionaries, high-ranking bureaucrats in all-union and republican ministries, and managers of large firms.\n\nIn the past 20 years Russian workers have seen their living standards and birth rates plummet, and “surplus deaths” skyrocket into the millions. And yet until just recently, Russian workers have remained quiescent. Surely these post-Soviet developments have a bearing on the common claim that the USSR fell because it had become clear to everyone that capitalism could do a better job of delivering the goods.\n\nIf Soviet policymakers could for decades deny the class character of the USSR, then how could they be said to have implemented Marxism at all? Whatever one may wish to call the official ideology of the Soviet Union during Stalin’s tenure, Marxism did not inform Soviet policy any more than John Locke and Jeffersonian democracy inform United States policy today.\n\nOf course, this raises more questions than it lays to rest, including the question: Why was socialism not implemented? And, the more ominous question: Is it even implementable?\n\nComparing the state of the Russian Federation today to its immediate predecessor, it has become clear that the problem with Soviet Russia had much more to do with the fact that it was Russia than that it was Soviet. What Somel has called the “failed, discredited project” of 20th-century socialism was the failure of attempts to build socialism on a non-capitalist foundation.\n\n[P]erhaps Somel has posed the problem wrongly. Perhaps the problem is not so much that historical materialism is disconnected from social struggles, but rather the reverse. Marxists might take a brief recess from the hand wringing and self-flagellation to reflect on the fact that when workers in Eastern Europe and Russia embraced the opponents of Marxism, they were the first and the worst to lose. Identity politics has been worse than a failure, and the massive movement with the revealingly un-Marxist title, the “anti-globalisation movement,” has disappeared with hardly a trace.\n\nWith due respect to Somel, what we have witnessed in recent decades is that when political action is disconnected from Marxism, the social struggles are doomed to failure, co-optation, or worse.\n\nThe most clear-sighted environmentalists, the most militant union activists, the most perseverant fighters for women’s rights, the most determined enemies of imperialism—they all need fighting Marxists and thinking communists, in the most ecumenical sense of the word.\n\nClick here to read the article."
