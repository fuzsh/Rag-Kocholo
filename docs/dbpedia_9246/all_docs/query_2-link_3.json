        "text": "The Soviet Union's chief cartographer acknowledged today that for the last 50 years the Soviet Union had deliberately falsified virtually all public maps of the country, misplacing rivers and streets, distorting boundaries and omitting geographical features, on orders of the secret police.\n\nIn an interview published tonight in the Government newspaper Izvestia, the chief map maker, Viktor R. Yashchenko, said the authorities had agreed to begin releasing accurate maps that have been classified as state secrets since the time of Stalin. Western experts said the maps apparently were distorted out of fear of aerial bombing or foreign intelligence operations.\n\n''We received numerous complaints,'' said Mr. Yashchenko, chief of the principal mapping agency, the Geodesy and Cartography Administration of the Council of Ministers. ''People did not recognize their motherland on maps. Tourists tried in vain to orient themselves on the terrain.''\n\nAs one example, American diplomats and correspondents based in Moscow find that the most reliable street map of Moscow is produced in the United States, by the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nAmerican and British cartographers, long aware of the falsification of key features on Soviet maps, rejoiced today at the prospect that they might get a more accurate picture of Soviet geography. [ Page 4. ] Mr. Yashchenko said the willingness to put out reliable maps reflected the policy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, calling for greater openness and a relaxation of what Mr. Yash-chenko called ''mistrust and spy mania.''\n\nThe falsification of Soviet maps, Mr. Yashchenko told Izvestia, began in the late 1930's when the map-making administration was put under control of the security police, then known as the N.K.V.D.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
