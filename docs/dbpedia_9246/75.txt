General Information[]

The Soviet Union, at its start, is a Secular Russian communist dictatorship taking up a large amount of Russia, Ural, Ruthenia and Pontic Steppe of Eastern Europe subcontinent, Caucasia region of Near East subcontinent, Central Asia, West Siberia, East Siberia, Mongolia and Manchuria regions of the Tartary subcontinent.

The communist regime replaces the rule of Russia on December 30, 1922, with cores, bordering European nations west and south, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Turkey, Finland, and more.

Furthermore, the countries of Persia, Afghanistan, China, Tannu Tuva and Mongolia, and Japan border the USSR's east.

History[]

The Soviet Union may also be formed by Russia if their government is either a socialist republic or a socialist state.

After the Second World War the USSR set up many communist satellite governments in Eastern Europe. January 1st, 1947 is bookmarked in the game as the beginning of the Cold War. This was a time period where the United States and the USSR were the two greatest powers standing after the war, both ascending to the title of a superpower. The USSR went on to have many outstanding achievements, including being the first in many space related achievements, although not represented in game (although the player can do this through a decision).

Soviet Union Strategy[]

Second World War[]

Cold War[]

(Historic) Vassal Strategy This is a more historical game option, where saving Monarch points and maintaining a large military is crucial. The player would have to go to the console commands and vassalize all Warsaw Pact members, along with Mongolia, as was the Soviet system during the cold war. The player will want to start building all possible buildings, along with creating more army (The USSR starts out with around half of its manpower limit). This strategy leaves 4 diplomatic relations slots open, and often the player will find himself wanting alliances with India (If the game is started after the release of India by Britain) and Saudi Arabia. Great Britain will accept an alliance under the right conditions, though they will be provoked if you choose to attack Iran or Afghanistan. If the player wants to avoid long alliance chains, a day one war with any nation will do (you have the Imperialism Casus Belli), though historic options will be Iran, Finland, or Afghanistan ( China will go after Afghanistan if enough time passes). Annexation of a vassal is possible sometime in the 1960s, Poland or Romania are the usual first targets.
