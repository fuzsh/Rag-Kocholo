        "text": "31 The Life and Selected Poems of Allen Ginsberg\n\nSulakshana Biswas\n\nIntroduction to the Beat Generation:\n\nNobody knows whether we were catalysts or invented something,\n\nor just the froth riding on a wave of its own.\n\nWe were all three, I suppose.\n\n-Allen Ginsberg\n\nThe Beat Generation movement originated in the 1950s America where a group of young writers were documenting, commenting and reflecting upon the observations of contemporary post World War II society and culture, which later yielded to play a pivotal role in shaping the transformational counter-culture wave that swept across America in the following decade. Jack Kerouac, one of the authors initiating the movement came up with the term “Beat Generation”, following a conversation with Herbert Huncke, a writer and a small- time street-hustler, who went on to become one of the greatest influences on the movement. The word “beat” has been frequently in use in Afro-American colloquialism and referred to a beaten down or tired situation, something that mirrored the post-world war cynicism that was also inspiring a new kind of Conservatism not only politically, but also socio-culturally. The most popular works that defined the style and ideology of the movement were Jack Kerouac’s On The Road, William S. Burroughs’s Naked Lunch and Junky, and Allen Ginsberg’s Howl. These works echoed the epoch of the “Beat” culture- rejection of conventional structures, anti-militarism, sexual exploration and freedom, and against the fascist regimentation of expression and society. Inspired from W. B. Yeats’s A Vision, they coined the term “A New Vision” that would be the prism through which they saw and depicted the world around them. Other major influences on the Beat literature was the poetry of Walt Whitman, the Romanticism in the works of P.B Shelley and William Blake, French Surrealists Antonin Artaud and André Breton, Arthur Rimbaud and the American modernists- Louis Ferdinand- Céline, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg also acknowledged the poetry of Emily Dickinson as a major influence on his work. William S. Burroughs cited the novel You Can’t Win by Jack Black, who inspired his writing. Other influences on this movement were the works of Samuel Beckett and Federico Garcia Lorca- Ginsberg even annotates Lorca in his poem A Supermarket in California. Later in the decade- most people involved with the Beat movement would join the San Francisco Renaissance which would give the world the “New American Poetry”. Jack Kerouac wrote the play, Beat Generation, which went on to be roughly adapted in Kerouac’s film, Pull My Daisy, named after the poem written by Ginsberg, Neal Cassady, and Kerouac in which Allen Ginsberg acted and improvised narration. Other noted personalities associated with the movement were, Neal Cassady, Gregory Corso, Bob Kauffman, Hal Chase, Peter Orlovsky, Edie Parker, Carolyn Cassady, Joyce Johnson, Elisa Nada Cowen, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and filmmaker Ruth Weiss, among others. This movement is generally attributed to Ginsberg and his associates. Allen Ginsberg and American poet Anna Waldman established the Naropa Institute’s Jack Kerouac School of Disembodies Poets in 1974.\n\nWhile Ginsberg was studying in the Montclair State College, he received a scholarship from the Young Men’s Hebrew Association to study in Columbia University where he met Lucien Carr, a senior who introduced him to William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and John Clellon Holmes. Lucien Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady and Kerouac used to refer to them as the dark and light side of the “New Vision” respectively. Kerouac even named the character based on Ginsberg as Carlo Marx, although he was never a card-bearer of the Communist party. In New York’s Pony Stable Bar, Ginsberg came into contact with Gregory Corso, and collaborated with him many times. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Burroughs and they would start travelling together.\n\nFollowing this period, Ginsberg moved to San Francisco, where working as a market researcher, his first anthology Howl and Other Poems was published in 1956, which he first dedicated to Lucien Carr, but following his request to remove his name from all further publications, he dedicated it to Carl Solomon, whom he met in a mental reformatory institution and became life-long friends until Solomon’s death in 1993. Solomon also helped Burroughs publish his first novel, Junky. Ginsberg’s mentor William Carlos William introduced his to the San Francisco Renaissance authors Kenneth Rexroth, James Broughton, Madeline Gleeson, Robert Duncan, Gary Snyder and then founded the Beatitude poetry magazine. This was the time Ginsberg met Peter Orlovsky with whom he fell in love and they remained together until Ginsberg’s death in 1997. Orlovsky and Ginsberg left San Francisco in 1957 and travelled to Morocco for a short span of time before accepting Corso’s invitation to Paris where they stayed in a shabby lodging above the bar at 9 rue Gît-le-Coeur, which was later named the Beat Hotel. It was here that Ginsberg started writing Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg, his deceased mother and Burroughs finished writing Naked Lunch- two seminal works of the Beat period.\n\nIn 1965, he moved to London and gave free readings of his works, which followed his participation in the International Poetry Convention, where he recited his works along with friend Gregory Corso. Ginsberg next worked closely in collaboration with the counter-culture movement and participated in the 1967, Human Be-In at San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, he demonstrated the concerns of the Hippie movement along with fellow Hippies Michael Bowen, Lou Reed and Edie Sedgwick. Ginsberg also travelled to Varanasi and Calcutta with Gary Snyder and Peter Orlovsky, where he befriended Bengali poets- Sunil Gangopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay and Malay Roy Chowdhury, and took interest in the Hungry Generation literary movement in Bengal, that influenced his September on Jessore Road.\n\nGinsberg collaborated with The Beatles’ member Sir Paul McCartney and recorded Ballad of the Skeletons, where the latter played the guitar.\n\nAllen Ginsberg’s The Fall of America shared the National Book Award for poetry in America in 1974. He was inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters after receiving the National Arts Club gold medal in 1979. He received the Robert Frost Medal and at the Struga Poetry Evenings, he won the Golden Wreath in 1986. Ginsberg was awarded the medal of Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et Letters in 1993, by the French Government.\n\nO Russian faced, woman on the grass, your long black\n\nhair is crowned with flowers, the mandolin is on your knees-\n\nCommunist beauty, sit here married in the summer\n\namong daisies, promised happiness at hand-\n\nholy mother, now you smile on your love, your world is\n\nborn anew, children run naked in the field spotted with dandelions,\n\nthey eat in the plum tree grove at the end of the meadow\n\nand find a cabin where a white-haired negro teaches the\n\nmystery of his rainbarrel-\n\nblessed daughter come to America, I long to hear your\n\nvoice again, remembering your mother’s music, in the Song of\n\nthe Natural front-\n\nO glorious muse that bore me from the womb, gave suck\n\nfirst mystic life & taught me talk and music, from whose pained\n\nhead I first took Vision-\n\nTortured and beaten in the skull- What mad hallucinations\n\nof the damned that drive me out of my own skull to\n\nseek Eternity till I find Peace for Thee, O Poetry- and for\n\nall humankind call on the Origin\n\nGinsberg started writing the poem in 1957 in the Parisian Beat Hotel, and it was finished in New York in 1959. It was published in 1961 as Kaddish and Other Poems. An absolute unorthodox way to compose a Kaddish and that too about one’s deceased mother- Ginsberg sought to adapt the underlying structure of Kaddish as a prayer- and the person he was writing about was his God in many ways. The language couldn’t have been different if the God was Naomi Ginsberg- who after her initial forays into Communism and the Communist party, was suffering from schizophrenic paranoia and persecution complex- complaining to the young Allen of her room being bugged by President Roosevelt because of her political ideologies. The poem revealed in the most organic manner, why was she godlike to Ginsberg- Ginsberg who was never fascinated with conventional heroes- sought to ventilate upon his mother, his god, through this poem. The poem also paints a very murky picture of the contemporary American socio-political scenario and how her mother reacted to it during her diagnosis with mental illness. A Kaddish is also a Judaic way of mourning, through hymns or chants- Ginsberg mourns not only the physical absence of his mother but also her uninhibited objectivity with which she always wanted to see the world. Ginsberg voices his alienation from the very umbilical tie not only to family but of the cultures and ideologies that he inherited from his mother.\n\nThe poem is written in five parts- after the second part ends, he writes a Hymn in praise of Naomi. The fifth part is abundant with the use of onomatopoeia to reflect upon the troubled psyche of Naomi, and ends as-\n\nLord Lord Lord caw caw caw Lord Lord Lord caw caw caw Lord\n\nConclusion:\n\nA non-conformist and a social anarchist in life, Ginsberg’s works echoed the same with his fresh, fiery, uninhibited way of expression. An advocate of gay rights and associated with the NAMBLA (North American Man/Boy Love Association), the civil society movement against the Vietnam war along with the likes of Noam Chomsky, a marijuana-legalization activist- Ginsberg’s free speech reflected on every epoch of the issues he sympathized with. Ginsberg went on to become of the most influential poets of the 20th century and he engaged himself in multi-disciplinary activities, apart from writing- such as his singing performances, academics and practice of sub-altern religions and customs. Ironically after Naomi Ginsberg referred to the “sunlight” that Allen was supposed to be looking for, Ginsberg declared- “Follow your inner moonlight; don’t hide the madness”."
