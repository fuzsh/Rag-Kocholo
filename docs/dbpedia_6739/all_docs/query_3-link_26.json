This technique allowed Veidt the ability to focus and retain several sources of information simultaneously.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs was a writer and visual artist, widely considered a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodern author who influenced popular culture and literature.\n\nAlan Moore cited William S. Burroughs as one of his main influences during the conception of Watchmen. He admired Burroughs' use of \"repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning\" in Burroughs' only comic strip, \"The Unspeakable Mr. Hart\", which appeared in the British underground magazine Cyclops.[1][2]\n\nIn Alan Moore's original script for Watchmen, Edgar Jacobi's physical appearance is described as \"something like William S. Burroughs\".\n\nNova Express, the popular anti-vigilante magazine in the Watchmen universe, is named after William S. Burroughs' novel of the same name.\n\nIn the HBO series, the in-universe novel Fogdancing by Max Shea was influenced by William S. Burroughs.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
