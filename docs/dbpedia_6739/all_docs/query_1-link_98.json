        "text": "“Brion Gysin was a subversive,” we are told in a wall text just off the elevator at this New Museum retrospective. Gay and itinerant, he had “no family, no clique, no fixed profession and, often, no fixed address.” He lived on multiple continents. He communed or collaborated with William S. Burroughs, Alice B. Toklas and the Rolling Stones. His artwork was shape-shifting; his methods fell outside the pantheon of recognized mediums.\n\nGysin’s life and work were partly shaped by failure. In 1935, at 19, he was to be included in an exhibition of Surrealist drawing in Paris, alongside Max Ernst, Salvador Dalí, René Magritte and Pablo Picasso: an extraordinary stroke of luck, reversed at the last minute when André Breton, the notorious Surrealist capo, ordered Gysin’s pictures taken down on the day of the opening. The artist would come to view this edict as a lifelong curse.\n\nGysin also failed as a fiction writer. Rejected by The New Yorker and a series of book publishers in the 1940s, he watched his friend Paul Bowles gain critical acclaim for his novel “The Sheltering Sky” (1949). Burroughsdescribed Gysin as “completely enigmatic because he was completely himself,” and completely himself because he was “unsuccessful as an artist.”\n\nBut retrospective exhibitions demand a different narrative, one that allows an artist to be packaged and cataloged into art historical significance. Thus, “Brion Gysin: Dream Machine” divides the work of an experimental polyglot, “chronologically and formally,” into four parts: paintings and drawings; works made with words; the “Dreamachine,” his magnum opus; and late collages and photomontages. Luckily, the curators don’t stick too slavishly to these parameters, allowing other works and projects to spill into the mix.\n\nGysin’s word pieces are among the strongest works in the show. Somewhere between poems and spoken-word compositions, they’re delivered in his voice via headphones and as a soundtrack to a slide show of scratched and manipulated images.\n\n“I Am That I Am,” from 1960, is a hypnotic chant that recalls Dada poetry and presages Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman and Steve Reich’s tape compositions. It also epitomizes Gysin’s interest in the Sufi trance music of Jajouka, a village in southern Morocco, one of many other connections to the music world. The exhibition mentions, mostly in passing, his interactions with Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Patti Smith, the performer Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and the jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy.\n\nMeanwhile, despite his early Surrealist trauma, Gysin continued to create art that coalesced around the visual. Paintings made by running a wallpaper roller or brayer incised with a grid pattern over canvas, and then applying calligraphic marks to the resulting grid, are pleasing abstractions in the vein of Mark Tobey. What’s most interesting about them here is their installation, which changes every day according to Gysin’s doctrine of “permutations” — an approach to art that also expressed itself as the Cut-Up Method of rearranging words and phrases in found texts. Gysin is best known, however, for the “Dreamachine,” a metal cylinder with a painted interior and cutout shapes that cause a light inside to flicker as the cylinder spins. Gysin conceived of the idea while riding on a bus in the South of France and experiencing the “flicker effect” of sunlight interrupted by evenly spaced trees.\n\nA friend, Ian Sommerville, helped him devise a prototype, which he patented in 1961, hoping to mass-produce it. (This never happened; the closest Gysin got was a small edition of the “Dreamachine” produced by Carlo Levi, a publisher in Basel, Switzerland, in 1979.) The official patent description calls the Dreamachine a “procedure and apparatus for the production of artistic visual sensations.”\n\nThe one at the New Museum is installed in a black room with cushions on the floor. It’s relaxing, it’s communal, it’s psychedelic. (Gysin’s use of drugs to unblock perception is another story.) But if you think about it, the work is also deeply connected to Modern art’s obsession with vision. Ad Reinhardt’s black paintings, for example, made around the same time, rely on a similar, sustained looking to produce images on the retina — the big difference being that the “Dreamachine” is one of the few “visual” artworks made to be experienced with the eyes closed.\n\nGysin, who died in 1986, is presented in “Dream Machine” more as a harbinger than a historical leader. For one thing, the current proliferation of art forms — artists can be painters or event planners; mock professors, chefs or object makers — makes his oeuvre look particularly prescient.\n\nBut there’s an even stronger linkto the present in Gysin’s embrace of magic. In his liner notes for “Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka,” an album of Moroccan music put out by Rolling Stones Records in 1971, Gysin wrote, “Magic calls itself The Other Method for controlling matter and knowing space.”\n\n“In Morocco, magic is practiced more assiduously than hygiene,” he added, though “ecstatic dancing to music of the brotherhoods may be called a form of psychic hygiene.”\n\nMagic is sprinkled throughout this show, from Breton’s inadvertent “curse” to a story about an intentional one in Morocco — a talisman made with hair that Gysin found in the wall of the restaurant he operated in the ’50s in Tangier — to sounds and images that actively stretch themselves past Dada and Surrealist chance operations, into murkier realms.\n\nThe audience for magic was small during Gysin’s lifetime. But young artists skeptical of scientific rationalism — or whatever brand of theory they’ve been offered at art school — are finding Gysin’s approach alluring. Which is why, in a bout of art historical conjuration, his reputation as an “unsuccessful artist” is being overturned."
