        "text": "When I first started my journey as a nascent literati, one of the first luminaries I was pointed to was the one and only William S. Burroughs. I had at first naturally gravitated to to the Beat writers, with the more palatable Jack Kerouac seemingly being the center of it all; and the romanticized images of the beats and their poetry reading, bongo playing, finger-snapping and tea smoking seemed like a hoot to me, so I tried reading On The Road, but I honestly found it boring. The Subterraneans didn’t seem much better, but then a more “hip” (as the Beats would say) friend turned me on to the works of the notorious, and later celebrated William S. Burroughs. I even later re-read a part of On The Road because Burroughs made a cameo in it as “Old Bull Lee”. Kerouac and Burroughs were good friends, and collaborated on the novel And The Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, which I have yet to read.\n\nI think my favorite book by Burroughs was the first one I read- Junky. I thought it was interesting, and I like Burroughs most when he was writing about drugs and their effects. I also read Queer, because I was told it was important though I found it much less interesting, as I found Burroughs details about his sex life to be a bit gross, and in his later books, the Red Night series (which I didn’t care for) to be teetering on the edges of pedophilia.\n\nI’m not listing a bibliography, but I’ll outline the writings of Burroughs that I did like. I tried to read Naked Lunch, because it was supposed to be “cool”, but I thought it nonsensical and uninteresting, much like the later film adaptation. However, I got a copy of the book with Letter From a Master Addict to Dangerous Drugs, which I found to be quite interesting. I liked his short stories in Interzone, and The Yage Letters. I also liked Exterminator.\n\nI found Burroughs to be compelling as a writer because he started as an unlikely outcast; obscene and outlawed. From there he rose (no doubt through some of his associations) to become a pop culture darling in the counter-culture world of the 60’s. The Mamas and the Papas named-dropped “mugwumps”- strange characters from Naked Lunch in “Creeque Alley” that they even sung on the “Ed Sullivan Show” no less. In the early 70’s a band named itself Steely Dan, after a dildo in Naked Lunch. There were other bands that took this tack too-like The Soft Machine and Thin White Rope. Luckily no one has named their band something like “Cornhole Gus”, at least that I know of.\n\nInto the 70’s Burroughs became even more accepted, rubbing elbows with pop icons like Bowie (who used his “cut-ups’ method for lyrics) and Andy Warhol. He was a pariah no longer.\n\nBy the time I came of age, (late 80’s into the 90’s) he became a grandfatherly figure in the alternative scene, his pinched and pensive face staring out from posters, album covers and books in all the cool shops and even in chain stores. He had worked with numerous musicians and artists like Keith Haring and Kurt Kobain. I used to listen to the compilation Smack My Crack a lot because it was a collaboration of Burroughs and cool bands like Einsturzunde Neubaten, the Butthole Surfers, Nick Cave and Tom Waits.\n\nBurroughs also appears in one of my favorite movies, Drugstore Cowboy, with Matt Dillon, where he plays a junky priest with his signature croaky voice that delivered some great monologues, near the twilight of his long, seedy and illustrious career, which must have seemed unimaginable to him when he first started writing seriously after shooting his second wife in the head. He probably never imagined himself and his characters popularized in books, songs and films. He became a titan in some circles, a touchstone of the counter-culture, an icon of those who would rebel.\n\nTo me personally, Burroughs will always seem to be an unlikely figure of literature, a man who dressed and looked like an unassuming square, but was possessed with a desire for experience and expression, with writing, drugs, guns, religion and pederasty. He was by turns both distasteful and compelling in my mind, and he looms large amongst the early writers that shaped me, and my desire to read and write.\n\nLast night after starting this post, I had a strange dream in which Burroughs lived in my ramshackle apartment building. He drove a brown 1975 Lincoln and never said much. He made money for drugs by potty-training toddlers in the parking lot, who in turn paid him with chicken eggs- makes about about as much sense as Naked Lunch, I guess. Anyway, goodnight Brother Bill, and get outta my head!\n\nI used to like to think of myself as a bit of a photographer, once. Here’s a photo I once took, in my artsy little room:\n\nI used to take photos of everything, dog turds, used syringes, buildings, strange looking people, and pretty girls, when I could find them. I shot black and white Tri-X and T-max film, developing them myself in my kitchens and bathrooms. Then I discovered the tried and true Kodachrome, and went into the world of saturated colors. With my little K-1000 Pentax SLR I imagined myself to be in the same league as National Geographic photographers, that used Kodachrome up to at least 2000. It was a hard blow to hear that Kodak was going to quit making Kodachrome. Luckily I didn’t have the money to hoard it, like others did, because after a few years of saying they wouldn’t, they quit processing Kodachrome entirely.\n\nI know they still make black and white film for students, though I never see anyone shooting it. Color negative and slide film are still available, but getting it processed takes time in most places. Now it seems like everyone with a cellphone is a photographer, with armies of narcissists taking endless selfies and posting them for likes.\n\nDigital photography is more cost-efficient, and immediate, no doubt, but I think something has been lost. I rarely see prints anymore, and if they are they are usually printed on a printer. Cell phone photos look flat to me, and all the best new digital SLR’s are very expensive. If I got back into photography I’d like to use a view camera, but the price is prohibitive. I’d like to do some daguerreotypes, but the cost factor is even higher. I’d like to get into photography again, but it doesn’t excite me anymore, or maybe the world doesn’t.\n\nI might posts some more old photos, for the hell of it, soon.\n\nOne of the books I still have with me after all my moves (after moving out of my parent’s house) is Arthur Rimbaud’s collected poems, Penguin edition, introduced, edited and translated by Oliver Bernard. I can’t speak French, but compared to the other translations of Rimbaud’s work I have read, this is my favorite. The book is a little battered now and yellowing a bit. I still have the receipt from the bookstore (whose name I now forget) tucked away in the book, dated 03-28-93, $9.95 before tax, plus .80 cent tax came to $10.75.\n\nThough I don’t remember the name of the book store, I remember the day as bright and sunny. I walked a few blocks to what I would have considered a bohemian bookstore in those days to get a cup of their bland coffee and browse the books, and maybe hopefully get to look at the pretty young girl that worked there too, but she wasn’t there that day. I hadn’t been in for a few days, and I was excited to see the Rimbaud book sitting in a patch of sunlight on the shelf, on a little stand, it’s cover facing outward. I had an interest in Rimbaud since an older friend I had admired, another foolish writer of bad poetry, with a head full of Camus, Artaud, and yes Rimbaud had recommended him to me. He had told me slyly, (and perhaps sarcastically) that I reminded him of Rimbaud a little, with my rebelliousness and insouciance towards authority. I thumbed through the book, giddy at the French words that danced upon the top of the page and the smaller English translation at the bottom, pausing only to read a short poem, TETE DE FAUN (Faun’s Head). I knew then that I had to have this book, no matter how expensive it was to me at the time.\n\nLater that evening, while drinking some cheap red wine from a small glass as I imagined a Frenchman might do, I read and re-read TETE DE FAUN over and over again, trembling at the power of the words, like Genet masturbating in his jail cell, I saw the images of the poem:\n\nTETE DE FAUN\n\nAmong the foliage, green casket flecked with gold; in the uncertain foliage that blossoms with gorgeous flowers where sleeps the kiss, vivid, and bursting through the sumptuous tapestry,\n\na startled faun shows his two eyes and bites the crimson flowers with his white teeth. Stained and ensanguined like mellow wine, his mouth bursts out in laughter beneath the branches.\n\nAnd when he has fled -like a squirrel- his laughter still vibrates on every leaf, and you can see, startled by a bullfinch, the Golden Kiss of the Wood, gathering itself together again.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nI read this poem repeatedly, the words going through my mind and mumbled from my lips like the prayers of a rosary, I quite forgot myself, and an ash from my unfiltered cigarette fell and burned a hole on the French text! It is still there today! I was mesmerized by this poem that had no ME or YOU or I, just a depiction of a moment in the woods that may have been witnessed by a person or not; a beautiful moment of gorgeousity sensed only perhaps by the sylvan creatures, the trees, and the Sun, the Golden Kiss of the Wood that shone gently down on them all. It brought back memories of the times when I, as a lonely boy, would go back into the woods behind my house to sit and hear the sounds of the birds, the wind whispering through the trees, the rustling of the animals, as I gazed down and smiled at the dappled light that shone down through the trees and danced on the forest floor. These were some of my most treasured, solitary moments, my secret garden, so similar to the one described in that short poem of Rimbaud’s. Today it is still my favorite poem, especially now that poetry seems so coarse and vulgar to me. Most of what I have heard or read is often political; a few scribbled lines, that if prurient or provocative enough, makes the idiot who wrote them considered to be an auteur. Perhaps I am bitter now; I once wanted to be a poet, but I was so painfully bad at it- I hope dear reader, (if you exist) that you don’t consider my prose to be as painful to read as I found my own poetry.\n\nTETE DE FAUN was not the only poem I liked by Rimbaud, even though it is my favorite, I also very much liked UNE SAISON EN ENFER , (A Season In Hell); some of the lines struck me like a bolt of lightning:\n\nUNE SAISON EN ENFER\n\nOnce, if I remember correctly, my life was a feast at which all hearts opened and all wines flowed.\n\nAnd:\n\n-But my dear Satan, I beg you, an eye a little less inflamed! And while we are waiting for the few little overdue dirty deeds, you, who like in a writer the absence of descriptive or instructive talent, for you I tear off these few hideous pages from my notebook of a damned soul.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nThough I liked some of LES ILLUMINATIONS (Illuminations), it seemed obscure to me, full of references and allusions I didn’t understand. I do like some of Rimbaud’s letters, and it’s easy to see why Rimbaud has become such a cult figure, a sneering, beautiful little saint possessed of a genius that is truly hard to come by."
