        "text": "Antonin Artaud had great fashion sense.\n\nBronx-born writer Carl Solomon joined the United States Maritime Service in 1944 and traveled overseas to Paris, where he was encountered Surrealism and Dadaism. When he came back to the US, he voluntarily admitted himself to a New Jersey psychiatric hospital as Dadaist expression of being beat, being conquered, being overpowered. There, he received shock therapy instead of the lobotomy he requested. He wrote about the experience in Report from the Asylum: Afterthoughts of a Shock Patient.\n\nAt the psychiatric hospital, Solomon met Allen Ginsberg. (You can read about how Ginsberg ended up there in Burning Furiously Beautiful.) He introduced the young poet to the poetry of Antonin Artaud, a French poet of Greek ancestry (his parents were from Smyrna) whom he had seen give a screaming poetry reading in Paris. Artaud had written the first Surrealist film, The Seashell and the Clergyman (1928), and produced Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley’s The Cenci in 1935. The year after that, he went to Mexico, living with the native Tarahumara people and experimenting with peyote, before Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs would pack their bags for Mexico. Another year passed and Artaud was found penniless in Ireland, where he was arrested and deported. Back in France, he was sent to various psychiatric hospitals, where he was subjected to electroshock therapy. Notably, in his earlier years, Artaud had spent time in a sanatorium, where he read none other than Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nSolomon wrote Report from the Asylum with Artaud in mind, while Ginsberg wrote “Howl” with both Artaud and Solomon in mind.\n\nOnce again, I could not find any of his poems in public-domain English translation. So, here’s a quote I found interesting and relevant from Artaud’s prose piece The Theater and Its Double:\n\n“I cannot conceive any work of art as having a separate existence from life itself.”\n\nYou can read one of his poems, “Jardin Noir,” here.\n\n*4/24/14: The subject’s name was originally misspelled and has now been corrected. Thanks to my reader for pointing that out!\n\nPhoto by Etienne Carjat (1871)\n\nRimbaud’s kinda cute, eh?\n\nBefore Jack Kerouac coined the term “Beat Generation” during a conversation on the Lost Generation with fellow writer John Clellon Holmes, before he went on the road and lived a bohemian life, he attended (and dropped out of) Columbia University. It was through his Columbia connections—which Paul and I explain in more detail in Burning Furiously Beautiful (it’s actually super interesting to discover how they all met and became friends)—that Kerouac met Lucien Carr and Allen Ginsberg. Back then, the phrase they were throwing around was a “New Vision.”\n\nCarr had borrowed the phrase from Arthur Rimbaud, and the young friends in Morningside Heights used it to mean:\n\n1) Naked self-expression is the seed of creativity. 2) The artist’s consciousness is expanded by derangement of the senses. 3) Art eludes conventional morality.[17]\n\nAs a teenager, Rimbaud was part of the Decadent movement in late-nineteenth-century France. The term “Decadents” refers to the clever poets who preferred to show off their literary skill rather than emote as naturally as the Romantics. The earlier Romantics—such as William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats—used more colloquial language than the highly stylized language of the Decadents.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, Rimbaud wrote:\n\nI’m now making myself as scummy as I can. Why? I want to be a poet, and I’m working at turning myself into a seer. You won’t understand any of this, and I’m almost incapable of explaining it to you. The idea is to reach the unknown by the derangement of all the senses. It involves enormous suffering, but one must be strong and be a born poet. It’s really not my fault.\n\nSounds like something Kerouac might write, doesn’t it? Not because the author of On the Road sought to make himself scummy by any means, but because he shook off pretensions and suffered for his art, appreciating the authenticity of experience.\n\nI couldn’t find a translation of any of Rimbaud’s poetry that was in the public domain, so here is Rimbaud’s “My Bohemian Life (Fantasy)” in the original French:\n\nMa Bohème (Fantaisie)\n\nJe m’en allais, les poings dans mes poches crevées ;\n\nMon paletot aussi devenait idéal ;\n\nJ’allais sous le ciel, Muse ! et j’étais ton féal ;\n\nOh ! là là ! que d’amours splendides j’ai rêvées !\n\nMon unique culotte avait un large trou.\n\n– Petit-Poucet rêveur, j’égrenais dans ma course\n\nDes rimes. Mon auberge était à la Grande Ourse.\n\n– Mes étoiles au ciel avaient un doux frou-frou\n\nEt je les écoutais, assis au bord des routes,\n\nCes bons soirs de septembre où je sentais des gouttes\n\nDe rosée à mon front, comme un vin de vigueur ;\n\nOù, rimant au milieu des ombres fantastiques,\n\nComme des lyres, je tirais les élastiques\n\nDe mes souliers blessés, un pied près de mon coeur !\n\nYou can read a 1962 English translation by Oliver Bernard here."
