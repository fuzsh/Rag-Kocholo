        "text": "Holders of record: At February 29, 2008 there were 419 stockholders of record of Harmonics Common Stock. Dividends: Harmonic has never declared or paid any dividends on its capital stock. Harmonic currently expects to retain future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of its business and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Harmonics line of credit includes covenants prohibiting the payment of dividends. Securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans: The disclosure required by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K is set forth in the 2008 Proxy Statement under the caption Equity Plan Information and is incorporated herein by reference. Sales of unregistered securities: On July 31, 2007, Harmonic completed the acquisition of Rhozet Corporation pursuant to a merger transaction. In connection with the acquisition, Harmonic paid an aggregate consideration of approximately $15.5 million, which was comprised of (i) approximately $2.5 million in cash and 1,105,656 shares of Harmonics common stock in exchange for all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Rhozet, and (ii) approximately $2.8 million of cash which was paid in the first quarter of 2008, as provided in the definitive agreement related to such acquisition, to the holders of options to acquire Rhozets common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In connection with such sale of its common stock, Harmonic relied upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. (b) Use of proceeds: Not applicable. (c) Purchase of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers: During the three months ended December 31, 2007, Harmonic did not, nor did any of its affiliated entities, repurchase any of Harmonics equity securities.\n\n1. The 2007 income from operations and net income included a charge of $6.4 million for the expected settlement of the securities class action lawsuit, a restructuring charge of $0.4 million on a reduction in estimated sublease income for a Sunnyvale building and a charge of $0.5 million from the closure of the manufacturing and research and development activities of Broadcast Technology Limited. This was partially offset by a credit of $1.8 million from a revised estimate of expected sublease income due to the extension of a sublease of a building to the lease expiration. The acquisition of Rhozet in July 2007 resulted in a charge of $0.7 million related to the write-off of acquired in-process technology. The 2006 gross profit, loss from operations and net income included a charge of $3.0 million for restructuring charges associated with a management reduction and a campus consolidation. An impairment expense of $1.0 million was recorded in 2006 due to the writedown of the remaining balance of the BTL intangibles. The 2005 gross profit, loss from operations and net loss included a charge of $8.4 million for the writedown of inventory resulting primarily from the introduction of new products and the related obsolescence of existing inventory. Operating expenses included an expense of $1.1 million for severance costs from the consolidation of the Companys two operating segments into a single segment effective as of January 1, 2006, and a benefit of $1.1 million from the reversal of previously recorded excess facilities costs due to subleasing an excess facility. The 2004 gross profit, income from operations and net income included credits of $4.0 million for products sold during the year that had been written down in prior years. The 2003 gross profit, loss from operations and net loss included credits of $4.7 million for products sold during the year that had been written down in prior years. Operating expenses included credits of $2.2 million from the sale of our bankruptcy claims in Adelphia Communications resulting in the reversal of previously recorded bad debt provisions, and a litigation settlement charge of $2.7 million related to Power and Telephone Supply. 2. Income (loss) from operations for 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 included amortization and impairment expenses of intangible assets of $5.3 million, $2.2 million, $2.6 million, $13.9 million and $13.9 million, respectively. In 2006 an impairment charge of $1.0 million was recorded to write-off the remaining balance of the intangibles from the BTL acquisition. 3. On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which required the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards. 4. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). The effect of adopting this pronouncement was an increase in the Companys accumulated deficit of $2.1 million for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits that existed at January 1, 2007. 5. On December 8, 2006, we acquired Entone Technologies, Inc. for a purchase price of $48.9 million. Entone markets a software solution which facilitates the provisioning of personalized video services, including video-on-demand, network personal video recording, time-shifted television and targeted advertisement insertion. See Note 3 Acquisitions of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 6. On July 31, 2007, we acquired Rhozet Corporation for a purchase price of $16.2 million. Rhozet develops and markets software-based transcoding solutions that facilitate the creation of multi-format video for internet, mobile and broadcast solutions. See Note 3 Acquisitions of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nExhibit\n\nNumber 2 .1(iii) Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization by and among C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. and the Registrant dated October 27, 1999 3 .1(vi) Certificate of Incorporation of Registrant as amended 3 .3 Amended and Restated Bylaws of Registrant 4 .1(i) Form of Common Stock Certificate 4 .2(vii) Preferred Stock Rights Agreement dated July 24, 2002 between the Registrant and Mellon Investor Services LLC 4 .3(vii) Certificate of Designation of Rights, Preferences and Privileges of Series A Participating in Preferred Stock of Registrant 4 .4(i) Registration and Participation Rights and Modification Agreement dated as of July 22, 1994 among Registrant and certain holders of Registrants Common Stock 10 .1(i)* Form of Indemnification Agreement 10 .2(i)* 1995 Stock Plan and form of Stock Option Agreement 10 .3(i)* 1995 Director Option Plan and form of Director Option Agreement 10 .4(ii) Business Loan Agreement, Commercial Security Agreement and Promissory Note dated August 26, 1993, as amended on September 14, 1995, between Registrant and Silicon Valley Bank 10 .5(ii) Facility lease dated as of January 12, 1996 by and between Eastrich No. 137 Corporation and Company 10 .6(ix)* Form of Change of Control Severance Agreement between Registrant and certain executive officers of Registrant 10 .7(iv)* 1999 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan 10 .8(iv) Lease Agreement for 603-611 Baltic Way, Sunnyvale, California 10 .9(iv) Lease Agreement for 1322 Crossman Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 10 .10(iv) Lease Agreement for 646 Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale, California 10 .11(iv) Lease Agreement for 632 Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale, California 10 .12(iv) First Amendment to the Lease Agreement for 549 Baltic Way, Sunnyvale, California 10 .13(viii)* 2002 Director Option Plan and Form of Stock Option Agreement 10 .14(viii)* 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Form of Subscription Agreement 10 .15(v) Supply License and Development Agreement, dated as of October 27, 1999, by and between C-Cube Microsystems and Harmonic 10 .16(x) First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement by and between Harmonic Inc., as Borrower, and Silicon Valley Bank, as Lender, dated as of December 16, 2005 10 .17(xi) Transition Agreement by and between Harmonic Inc. and Anthony Ley, effective May 5, 2006 10 .18(xvi) Change of Control Severance Agreement by and between Harmonic Inc. and Patrick Harshman, effective May 30, 2006 10 .19(xiii) Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Harmonic Inc., Edinburgh Acquisition Corporation, Entone Technologies, Inc., Entone, Inc., Entone Technologies (HK) Limited, Jim Jones, as stockholders representative, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as escrow agent, dated as of August 21, 2006 10 .20(xiv) Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Harmonic Inc., Edinburgh Acquisition Corporation, Entone Technologies, Inc., Entone, Inc., Entone Technologies (HK) Limited, Jim Jones, as stockholders representative, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as escrow agent, dated August 21, 2006"
