        "text": "LAKELAND, Fla., Feb. 24, 2000 (PRIMEZONE) -- The following is market news from SmartPortfolio.Com, Inc., providing premium stock analysis on Internet stocks, stock splits, and IPOs at: http://www.smartportfolio.com/freetrials\n\nStock prices and percentage gains are reflective of February 24, 2000 at 6:30 PM, EST.\n\nTerayon up 525%, Ariba up 186%, Kana up 78%, and JDS Uniphase up 43% since being profiled in the Smart!Internet Report.\n\nThe Smart!Internet Report provides in-depth analysis of the Internet sector, with particular emphasis on individual Internet stocks with substantial upside potential. Some of the stocks that have been profiled in past issues of the Smart!Internet Report (see below) performed well today and have soared since we highlighted them in our Report. To read about promising Internet stocks, investors are invited to try a 2-week free trial of the Smart!Internet Report by visiting: http://www.smartportfolio.com/freetrials\n\nTerayon Communications (Nasdaq:TERN):\n\nThe recent explosion in Internet infrastructure stocks can be directly attributed to investors' confidence that widespread high-speed Internet access is close to becoming a reality. Terayon Communications, profiled in the Smart!Internet report on October 13, 1999, has exploded onto the scene, rising 333% since the beginning of this year and 525% since the date of the report. Terayon manufactures cable modem systems that enable high-speed, two-way access to the Internet for cable subscribers. There are many other cable modem manufacturers in this field, but Terayon has a significant competitive advantage over the rest: it also offers digital cable products and IP telephony capabilities. This combination of functionality positions Terayon extremely well to capture significant market share in the broadband kingdom. To find out more about Terayon and other Internet infrastructure outperformers, please go to: http://www.smartportfolio.com/freetrials\n\nAriba (Nasdaq:ARBA):\n\nAnother component of the e-business sector that is exploding is the procurement software market -- software that helps companies buy goods and services in order to do business. When Ariba was first profiled in the Smart!Internet Report on October 8, 1999 it was strictly focused on developing software that allows businesses to purchase indirect goods -- goods that are not a part of a company's actual products; rather, they are supporting products used for the company's overall operations like office supplies, etc. Since then, however, Ariba has expanded its business model and landed several large customers as its stock has soared 186% since the date of that report. Ariba rapidly expanded into the direct goods procurement market -- goods that directly go into the final product, such as raw materials, etc -- and launched a full-fledged online exchange. With nearly $1.5 trillion in goods and services expected to be transacted between business using the Internet by 2003, Ariba has positioned itself well to become a market leader in this lucrative industry. For more information on Ariba and other intriguing companies within the business-to-business e-commerce space, please go to: http://www.smartportfolio.com/freetrials\n\nKana Communications (Nasdaq:KANA):\n\nThe high-speed Internet access field is not the only niche that has captured investors' attention: e-business infrastructure companies that provide the tools necessary to do business online have also exploded onto the scene. Kana Communications, a provider of Internet customer relationship management software (\"eCRM\"), has jumped 78% since it was profiled in the Smart!Internet Report on December 1, 1999. The e-CRM sector is expected to surge over the next several years as customers take to the Internet to purchase goods and services: The Gartner Group estimates that companies will receive 25% of all customer inquiries via e-mail and Web-based forms by 2001. This will put tremendous pressure on companies to deliver effective customer service via multiple Internet channel including real-time chatting, IP telephony, and timely email response. Kana currently offers many of these services and is well positioned to take the lead in this burgeoning market. To find out more about Kana and other e-business companies that are expected to gain significant investor attention in the near future, please go to http://www.smartportfolio.com/freetrials\n\nJDS Uniphase (Nasdaq:JDSU):\n\nJDS Uniphase closed up 22 1/2 (+9.55%) to 258 on Thursday. The January 12, 2000 issue of the Smart!Internet Report profiled this fiber optics dynamo when its stock was trading at only 180 11/16. Based on today's closing price, JDSU shares have risen nearly 43% since that report. In that issue of the Smart!Internet Report, we noted several factors that we believed would make JDSU a top performer, including the company's successful strategic business combinations and JDSU's competitive position within the market as a one-stop-shop for all optical components.\n\nABOUT SMARTPORTFOLIO.COM, INC.\n\nSmartPortfolio.Com is a financial information company providing stock and market information and commentary to investors through its Web site, located at http://www.smartportfolio.com.
