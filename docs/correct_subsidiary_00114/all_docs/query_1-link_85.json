        "text": "Israeli electrical engineer\n\nShlomo Rakib is an Israeli electrical engineer known for his work on Orthogonal Time Frequency and Space (OTFS) and other engineering topics.[1][2] He is the holder of several patents and co-founder and current Chief Technology Officer of Cohere Technologies, which he had co-founded with Ronny Hadani.[3][4] He also co-founded Terayon in 1993.[5]\n\nRakib received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Technion University in Israel.[6] The university's Shlomo Rakib Fellowship Fund is named after him.[7]\n\nIn the 1980s, Rakib served as a communications engineer in the Israeli Navy.[8] Rakib also served as Chief Engineer at the communications products company PhaseCom from 1981 to 1993. As part of PhaseCom, he developed data and telephony applications.[6]\n\nShlomo Rakib founded Terayon in 1993 with his brother Zaki Rakib (IPO in 1998).[5][9][10][11] The company initially sold modems before developing other types of broadband technology.[12] Rakib served as the company's president and CTOs.[13][14]\n\nRakib invented Terayon's S-CDMA technology, which is a component of the DOCSIS 2.0 cable data specification used in cable modems.[9][15][16][8] As part of Terayon, he also developed data transmission methods utilizing Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and S-CDMA.[17] Rakib resigned as Terayon's president in 2004.[18] The firm was acquired in 2007 by Motorola.[19][20]\n\nIn 2004, Rakib co-founded Novafora, a company that developed microprocessors for advanced video applications.[21][5] The firm acquired semiconductor and microprocessor company Transmeta in 2009 before it eventually closed in the same year.[22][23][24][20]\n\nRakib and Ronny Hadani co-founded Cohere Technologies in 2009.[25][26] They met at one of Hadani's lectures about Orthogonal Time Frequency and Space (OTFS) at the University of Texas at Austin.[27][28][29] and founded the company after Rakib devised the idea to apply OTFS to wireless technology and signal processing.[27][28] The firm focuses on wireless improvements using OTFS and the Delay-Doppler model to improve FDD/TDD spectrum performance.[28][30][31]\n\nIn 2012, Rakib founded Gainspeed, a company specializing in DAA (Distributed Access Architecture). The company was initially known as Cohere Networks before being renamed Gainspeed in 2013.[32] The firm was acquired by Nokia in 2016.\n\nRakib's work has been cited by other scholars over 600 times.[33] His work has also been cited in textbooks.[34] His notable works include:\n\nRakib, S. (1997). An innovative cable modem system for broadband communication. 24 - 30. doi:10.1049/cp:19971238.\n\nZarai, Y., & Rakib, S. (2008).
