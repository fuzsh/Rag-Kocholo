        "text": "Securities litigation is one of the Firm’s largest practice areas. While most corporate law firms traditionally represent only defendants and not plaintiffs, we frequently represent both, and have done so in many of the highest-profile securities cases in the United States. In the aftermath of the U.S. financial crisis, we achieved verdicts and settlements totaling over $47 billion against many of the major banks responsible for the collapse of mortgage-backed securities. And our global presence allows us to represent clients in complex securities disputes in major financial markets in Europe, Asia, and Australia.\n\nWe have litigated every type of securities case, including the following:\n\nClaims under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n\nFraud and non-disclosure cases under state blue-sky laws\n\nMarket manipulation cases\n\nTakeovers and proxy disputes\n\nAll holders/best-price rule tender offer litigation\n\nInsider trading\n\nOption disputes\n\nValuations\n\nIn securities cases, we have represented:\n\nFortune 500 companies\n\nInvestment banks\n\nDirectors and officers\n\nSpecial committees\n\nAudit committees\n\nInstitutional investors\n\nHedge funds and private equity firms\n\nFinancial advisors\n\nBroker-dealers\n\nQuinn Emanuel has also, once again, been ranked first among the firms that major companies want to face least as opposing counsel (BTI Consulting Group, 2023). Our reputation is an advantage in the courtroom and in settlement discussions, because a credible trial threat can hasten a favorable outcome.\n\nWe also specialize in designing and conducting internal investigations and in negotiating with prosecutors and regulators, including the DOJ, SEC, CFTC, FTC, and CFPB. More than two dozen of the firm’s partners are former prosecutors, which includes former high-ranking Department of Justice lawyers and numerous alumni of United States Attorney’s Offices."
