        "text": "The warning season opened last week with a surprising and positive announcement from M-Systems Flash Disk Pioneers (Nasdaq: FLSH). M-Systems announced current quarter sales would increase by almost 23%, compared with earlier forecasts of 10%.\n\nOn the other hand, Terayon (Nasdaq: TERN) and Amdocs (NYSE: DOX) made truly catastrophic announcements. There is a common denominator to these two warnings. Both shares fell heavily in the days leading up to the announcements, without a hint from either company. Terayon completely collapsed, plummeting 25% in one day a week earlier, without the company saying anything.\n\nIt is unacceptable for a company to lose a quarter of its value on one day without any response from the management. On Thursday, an Israeli friend of mine, a portfolio manager in New York, called me to ask if I knew why trading in Terayon had been suspended, because the company said they knew nothing. After trading closed, Terayon published a revenue warning that sales would be halved. An odd company, to put it delicately.\n\nMy heart goes out to communications technology maven George Gilder. He has long recommended Terayon. Gilder’s recommendations are usually based on his explanations of the company’s technology, such as in the case of LanOptics (Nasdaq: LNOP), and its stake in EZChip. Two days before Terayon’s announcement, Gilder got down off the fence on the side of declaring the company a bargain. “Terayon is a strong investment opportunity at a ridiculous market value of only $141 million. That is only because Wall Street simply hates it,” said Gilder, just before Terayon’s market value plummeted to $93 million. The hatred will only intensify in light of the company’s actions before the warning.\n\nAmdocs has always been a secretive company, acting as if it issued shares solely for the benefit of its founders, executives and a few close well-informed institutional investors, while the public was merely an annoyance. Amdocs is a foreign company, registered in some far-off island, apparently a tax shelter. Transparency toward shareholders and public is unheard of. It is easier for me to get information from the Mossad than from Amdocs, which is why I avoided the company on its IPO, just four years ago at a price of $14 a share.\n\nI never understood who was really running the company. There is a triangle running between the cliff-side home of billionaire Amdocs founder Morris Kahn; the Aurec Building in Ramat Gan (the offices of major shareholders the brothers Meitar, the attorneys who created the complex and secretive company structure and prepare its business contracts); and the Amdocs Building in Ra’anana, where the company’s official executives are based. It is no wonder that in Friday’s papers I read in the news pages that Amdocs planned to lay off 900 employees, while also seeing a full-page help-wanted ad.\n\nComverse Technology (Nasdaq: CMVT) did not post any help-wanted ads the day it published a warning. Amdocs’ new president and CEO Dov Baharav, not the company’s owners, will face the hard downsizing job. They all sold their shares in time. Who bought them? The people who listened to the trumpeting by the analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston, Robertson Stephens and US Bancorp Piper Jaffray on the eve of the warnings, declaring there was no objective reason for the share to fall.\n\nMost analysts accepted M-Systems’ upwardly revised forecasts with reservations. Most of them claim the company’s DiskOnKey (DOK) product, which was responsible for a pleasant surprise for the third consecutive quarter, will quickly fall by the wayside when new cheap Asian products flood the market. They also claim that M-Systems’ cellular product, MobileDiskOnChip (MDOC), has not yet taken off, and the company will post losses through 2004.\n\nI think that M-Systems will provide surprises by the end of the year that will remove all these doubts. There will be new generations of DOK, based on the unique ASIC chip, for new and surprising applications that will leave its Far Eastern competitors behind. The competition will also face legal challenges for copyright violations. MDOC will soar in the third quarter (which begins next week), thanks to its initial use in two of Nokia’s cellular devices. Nokia and M-Systems declined to conform this.\n\nThe first device is part of the communicator family that integrates telephones and hand-held computers – a small volume item. But the second device is one of Nokia’s large volume lines intended for the Christmas season. Last week Nokia announced, “Over a million telephones a month with the multimedia capable Symbian operating system will be marketed a month in the fourth quarter.” This is precisely M-Systems’ market. Another major manufacturer of the Symbian consortium (Motorola or Sony-Ericsson), will probably become an M-Systems’ customer by the end of the year.\n\nI think MDOC’s take-off, DOK’s continued dizzying success and falling production costs caused by the dollar’s depreciation, will make M-Systems profitable by the fourth quarter of 2002. The DOK and MDOC growth engines will generate growth in 2003, too, and the third growth engine, called MirrorBit, will come into play in the second half of the year. If successful, this joint effort by Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq:AMD) and M-Systems will bring M-Systems closer than ever to president and CEO Dov Moran’s dreams of two years ago.\n\nToward the end of 2003, AMD and M-Systems will launch products based on AMD’s new technology for the cellular market. MirrorBit is designed to compete against Intel’s (Nasdaq:INTC) products for the same market.\n\nAn interest Israeli dilemma recently came up. Saifun Semiconductors claims that AMD stole its technology for MirrorBit, and filed suit last February. M-Systems is in the embarrassing situation of owning 2.5% of Saifun, and Saifun founder Boaz Eitan sits on M-Systems board of directors. M-Systems is simultaneously working with AMD to develop this technology. A statement by AMD to the SEC may solve the dilemma, “When we are sued for patent violation, we aim to reach a royalties agreement with the plaintiff.” If such an agreement is reached, it will benefit all the parties, including Tower Semiconductor (Nasdaq: TSEM), which owns 12% of Saifun.\n\nThe above recommendations were made by a person/s working in the investment industry, who may hold positions in securities mentioned in the column.
