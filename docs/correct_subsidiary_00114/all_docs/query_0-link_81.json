Imedia Semiconductor products include the IM6000 chip for cable modems and the IM5000 chip for headends. Both chips are DOCSIS 1.0, DOCSIS 1. 1 and DOCSIS 2.0 based and successfully implement the S-CDMA (synchronous code division multiple access) and A-TDMA (advanced time division multiple access) advanced physical layer modulation techniques included in the DOCSIS 2.0 draft specification. With the combined technologies, the chips enable cable operators to increase their existing upstream bandwidth by three times and greatly improve noise immunity without additional network upgrades to their existing cable plant. Cable operators can instantly add more highly-profitable data subscribers to their network, and begin providing revenue-generating advanced services like peer-to-peer computing, VoIP and multi-user online gaming.\n\n\"With DOCSIS 2.0 based IC software and reference designs, Imedia Semiconductor is in a great position to support the industry's transition to DOCSIS 2.0-based products,\" said Kishore Manghnani, vice president of marketing, Imedia Semiconductor. \"The company has competitively priced products that are available now working live on the show floor, proving that DOCSIS 2.0-based systems and advanced services are ready for immediate market deployment.\"\n\nAbout Imedia Semiconductor\n\nImedia Semiconductor Corp. designs, manufactures and sells highly integrated silicon and software solutions for cable modems, VoIP, CableHome, headends and digital cable set-top boxes. Today, Imedia Semiconductor chipsets are included in over 6,000 headends and 2 million cable modems. Imedia Semiconductor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Terayon Communication Systems.\n\nImedia Semiconductor can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.imedia.com/.\n\nFor more information, call 408/327-7968."
