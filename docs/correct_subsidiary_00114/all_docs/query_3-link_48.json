        "text": "Today’s internet user demands super fast and Mega data upload/download internet connection to address their enjoyment and satisfaction during Internet surfing, On-line Gaming, Video streaming, Voice and Video calls and other on-line interactive applications.\n\nCABLELABS introduced DOCSIS 3.0 CMTS to meet these demand by the use of Channel Bonding on both Downstream and Upstream channels at the CMTS.\n\nChannels bonding process:\n\nUnlike DOCSIS 1.x and 2.x CMTS that use only One (1) narrow band Downstream and Upstream channels for internet connectivity, DOCSIS 3.0 CMTS uses multiple Downstream and Upstream Channels to deliver more Bandwidth to the internet users.\n\nThe magic was made by making 4 or 8 downstream channels aggregated as 1-Logical Downstream channel.\n\nFor example: If 1-downstream channel generates 38Mbps of data…\n\n4-channels will generate 152Mbps (38Mbps x 4 = 152Mbps) of data rates bonded as 1-Logical Downstream channel connection and…\n\n8-channels will generate 304Mbps (38Mbps x 8 = 304Mbps) of data rates bonded as 1-Logical channel Downstream connection.\n\nThe same is true with the Upstream with 4-channels aggregated as 1-Logical Upstream channel. For example: If 1-upstream channel can take 27Mbps then 27Mbps x 4 = 108Mbps of take-up data rates bonded as 1-Logical upstream connection.\n\nDownstream Bonded channels don’t need to be adjacent, but said channels should be within the 60Mhz window capability of the DOCSIS-3.0 Cable Modems.\n\nBackward compatibility:\n\nSince DOCSIS 1.x and 2.0 CMTS used only One (1) narrow band Downstream and Upstream channel for internet connectivity, bonded channels in DOCSIS 3.0 can be used either as primary-capable channels (narrowband channels), or as part of bonded channels (wideband channels), or both.\n\nDOCSIS 3.0 CMTS BLOCK DIAGRAM\n\nWideband Cable Modem:\n\nLegacy modems like Docsis 1.x and Docsis 2.x are narrow band (single channel) modems. These modems identify themselves during TFTP configuration process and therefore set by the CMTS to operates only in a narrow band mode configuration.\n\nDocsis 3.x modems however notify the CMTS that they are wideband-capable modems and therefore gets wideband mode configuration. Bonded channels are then received, decoded and the packets are extracted for 10/100/1000-Mbps Ethernet connection.\n\nDocsis 3.0 Cost of Data Rates Challenge:\n\nOne of the challenged that cable operators are facing right now is where to get large internet connection bandwidth at low cost since 1-Mbps cost per dollar is so high that it almost dilute the profit margin during distribution. One solution maybe is to build a cloud computing network at the Headend to serve emails, localized gaming, video streaming, a cache server for Google, Yahoo, FaceBook, YouTube and other sites worthy of investing clusters of servers to generate huge bandwidth for Docsis 3.0 Mega upload/download process.\n\nThe purpose here is to let data stream traffic from majority of internet sessions to be localized (Headend to subscribers only and not on the subscribers towards the ISP) in that way realization of enjoyment and satisfaction on the part of the internet user is achieve using Docsis 3.0.\n\nPlease share this Blog to your friends! Thank you.\n\nThe Cable Modem Termination System CMTS has been the de-facto platform in delivering internet service in the Cable TV Network. Manufacturer such as ARRIS, C9 Networks, Motorola, Cisco, Big-Band, Broadcom and many others keeps on improving their product to adopt to any emerging technology and applications suited for the CMTS operation.\n\nCurrent application capability of the CMTS includes High Speed Internet, VoIP, IPTV, Video On Demand, Video Telephony and Tele-Presence.\n\nDOCSIS\n\nData Over Cable Systems Interface Specification (DOCSIS) is the system standard for the CMTS and it is used to in-forced the inter-operability between brand of CMTS and Cable Modems and also the Downstream and Upstream Speed capability requirements.\n\nExample: A Motorola CMTS should be inter-operable and be able to serve a Scientific Atlanta or Terayon Cable Modems.\n\nDOCSIS comes in many versions and the latest has been utilized to fit the need of the current CMTS applications such as IPTV and Video On-demand\n\nDOCSIS Version and Maximum Usable Speed\n\nDOCSIS Version Downstream Speed Upstream Speed DOCSIS 1.x 38Mbps 9Mbps DOCSIS 2.x 38Mbps 27Mbps DOCSIS 3.x (4-Chan) 152Mbps 108Mbps DOCSIS 3.x (8-Chan) 304Mbps 108Mbps\n\n(DOCSIS 2.x and 3.x is capable of Symmetrical service which means downstream and upstream speed delivered to the Cable Modem is the same. The above DATA is based on the US DOCSIS Standards at 6-MHZ Bandwidth. A EuroDOCSIS is also available at 8-MHZ Bandwidth and with higher throughput.)\n\nCompatibility\n\nAll DOCSIS standards CMTS and Cable Modems must be Forward/Backward Compatible to each other, for example a DOCSIS 2.0 CMTS is capable of serving a DOCSIS 1.0 Cable Modem at DOCSIS 1.0 speed (Backward compatible), and a DOCSIS 2.0 CMTS is capable of serving a DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modems at DOCSIS 2.0 speed (Forward compatible).\n\n(For advanced CMTS users please visit Brady Volpe website at www.volpefirm.com for more advanced technical exploration on the DOCSIS and CMTS.)\n\nISP Connection\n\nTo start an internet service via cable TV network you must acquire an ISP connection so that your subscribers can connect to the internet. Shown below are the IP Address details to be provided by your ISP for Internet connection.\n\nISP Parameters Value Purpose Line Rates 2Mbps Down load/ Up load Speed CIR 2Mbps Committed Information Rate Network Address 122.59.32.0 ISP Network Address Router IP Address 122.59.32.2 Your Router’s WAN Address Subnet Mask 255.255.255.252 Total Usable IP Address Default Gateway 122.59.32.1 Your ISP IP Address Preferred DNS 122.59.10.7 Name to IP Add Translator Alternate DNS 122.59.10.8 Name to IP Add Translator\n\nBased on 512/256 kbps subscription rate, a Line Rates of 2Mbps with the CIR of 2Mbps is good for 35-internet users only as per current Internet applications such as YouTube, Face Book, Skype with Video Conferencing and others. All IP addresses here are Public IP Address.\n\nThe Public IP address of your Router in the Internet side (WAN) is static and should be visible to the internet.\n\nPrivate LAN Connection\n\nThe PC unit in your office, the Cable Modems and the Laptop of your subscriber belongs to the Private Local Area Network or Private LAN. They require a Private IP Address to communicate to the World Wide Web via a single Public IP. The most common Private IP Address is in the 192.168.1.0 network.\n\nThe Private IP address at the LAN side of your Router is not visible to the Internet because it is used only for internal IP addressing. Details of Private IP Address on your LAN side are as follows.\n\nPrivate IP Parameters Value Purpose Network Address 192.168.1.0 Your Private Network Add Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 Total Usable IP Address Default Gateway 192.168.1.1 Your Router’s LAN Address Broadcast IP add 192.168.1.255 Network Broadcast Add Preferred DNS 122.56.10.7 Name to IP Add Translator Alternate DNS 122.56.10.8 Name to IP Add Translator\n\nA Subnet Mask of 255.255.255.0 means you can assign up to 254 IP addresses to your private network.\n\nRouter\n\nA Router is a device that you can used to connect to the World Wide Web. A Public and Private IP addresses given by your ISP provider must be entered or configured to the Router to facilitate an internet connection.\n\nSwitch Hub\n\nA Switch Hub is a device used for inter-connecting two (2) or more computers including the CMTS. Since a Router commonly has 4-Ethernet ports which might not be enough to accommodate all your PC connections, you can use an un-managed Switch with 8, 16 or 24 ports which ever fits your need.\n\nDHCP/TFTP and TOD Servers\n\nA CMTS requires a DHCP server (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) to be able to distribute the private IP addresses to the Cable Modems and the Subscriber’s PC unit. A TFTP server (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is used to facilitate the down loading of the needed file configuration to the Cable Modem, and the TOD server is the one that time stamp the activity or transactions between the CMTS and the Cable Modem.\n\nThe C9Networks CMTS\n\nMy first CMTS deployment project was in Paradise Cable TV Network in Boracay Island and the C9Network C1000 CMTS was used to implement a cable internet service. C9Network is quick and easy to deploy for cable internet service because it has all the servers you need (DHCP/TFTP and the TOD servers) that is imbedded inside the CMTS chassis, and the Provisioning Server functionality is user friendly that it no longer requires an IT expert to manage all the needed configurations for the CMTS.\n\nC9Network C1000 CMTS has 1-Downstream Port and 1-Upstream Port. It also has a 1-DB9 Serial Port for Command Line Interface (CLI) configuration and 1-Ethernet Port for LAN connection. C9 Network C1000 is a DOCSIS 1.0/1.1 CMTS and is capable of handling 250-Cable Modems.\n\nCMTS configurations\n\nYou need to define the following IP address to the CMTS so that it can deliver a cable internet service. They are the following.\n\nCMTS Ethernet side\n\nYou need to configure to the CMTS the following parameters for connection to the Ethernet side.\n\nEthernet Port 0/0 IP Addresses Purpose Eth 0/0 IP Add 192.168.1.2 for Router connection Default Gateway 192.168.1.1 Router LAN Add Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 Total Usable IP Preferred DNS 122.56.10.7 Name to IP Translator Alternate DNS 122.56.10.8 Name to IP Translator TFTP Server Add 192.168.1.2 CMTS Internal TFTP TOD Server Add 192.168.1.2 CMTS Internal TOD DHCP Network 192.168.1.0 CMTS Internal DHCP Start of IP Distribution 192.168.1.16 1st IP Address to be distribute by the DHCP End of IP Distribution 192.168.1.254 Last IP Address to be distribute by the DHCP Excluded IP Add 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.16 Group of IP Address Not meant for distribution by the DHCP CMTS User ID aegistechnotes Log-IN ID CMTS Log-IN Password – – – – – – – – – Log-IN Password\n\nCMTS Cable Network side\n\nYou need to configure to the CMTS the following parameters for connection to the Cable Network side.\n\nCable Ports Details Purpose Down Stream Port DS – 0/0 CMTS DS Port Frequency 453Mhz DS Forward Chan Frequency TX Power 54dBmv Downstream Transmit Power Code Rate 64-QAM Modulation type Channel Bandwidth 6Mhz Downstream Bandwidth Up Stream Port US 0/0 CMTS US Port Frequency 25Mhz US Return Frequency Code Rate QPSK Modulation type Channel Bandwidth 1.6MHZ Upstream Bandwidth US Input Power -13dBmv Minimum US Input Power\n\nCMTS Subscription Packages\n\nCable Internet Packages in the CMTS requires a Cable Modem’s MAC address binding.\n\nPackages Downstream Rate (Kbps) Upstream Rate (Kbps) Silver 512 256 Gold 768 512 Platinum 1024 512 Disabled 10 10\n\nManagement PC Connection\n\nA Management PC is required to manage the activity of the Router, the CMTS and the Internet connection. The details are the following.\n\nManagement PC Details Purpose IP address 192.168.1.3 PC IP Address Default Gateway 192.168.1.1 Routers LAN IP Add Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 Network Mask Preferred DNS 122.56.10.7 Name to IP Translator Alternate DNS 122.56.10.8 Name to IP Translator Log-IN to Router 192.168.1.1 Router’s Web Page IP Address Log-IN to CMTS 192.168.1.2 CMTS Web Page IP Address\n\nRouter’s Configuration\n\nWAN Ports Details\n\nValue Parameters Purpose WAN Port IP Address 122.59.32.2 Your Router’s WAN Address Subnet Mask 255.255.255.252 Total Usable IP Address Default Gateway 122.59.32.1 Your ISP IP Address Preferred DNS 122.59.10.7 Name to IP Add Translator Alternate DNS 122.59.10.8 Name to IP Add Translator\n\nLAN Port Details\n\nParameters Value Purpose Network Address 192.168.1.0 Your Private Network Add Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 Total Usable IP Address LAN Default Gateway 192.168.1.1 Your Router’s LAN Address Preferred DNS 122.56.10.7 Name to IP Add Translator Alternate DNS 122.56.10.8 Name to IP Add Translator Network Address 192.168.1.0 Your Private Network add DHCP ***Disabled*** Router’s DHCP server should be “Disabled” if your CMTS has a built-in DHCP Server.\n\nMode of IP Address distribution\n\nBoth Cable Modem and the Computer unit require an IP address, meaning you need to allocate 2-IP addresses per Cable Internet Client. The Cable Modems IP address which is Local and the Computer unit IP address which is Routable to Internet so that a PC can browse to the World Wide Web.\n\nIn the case of the C9Network CMTS using an internal DHCP we only have at least 238 IP to distribute which could serve 119 clients only as a result of the 2-IP address per client rule. (192.168.1.17 to 192.168.1.254)\n\nYou must use an external DHCP server with 2-Address Pools, one (1) Local IP address pool for the Cable Modem and the other one (1) is a Routable address pool for the client’s computer Unit to fully utilize the 250-Cable modem served by the C-1000 CMTS. The CMTS with external DHCP server should work as Layer-2 Bridge. External DHCP and Subscriber Provisioning server is available from the C9Networks for all their CMTS.\n\nCisco CMTS will follows NEXT. Thank you!"
