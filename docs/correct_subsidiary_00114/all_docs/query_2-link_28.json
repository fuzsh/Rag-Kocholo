        "text": "Terayon Communication Systems, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based\n\ncable-modem manufacturer, reported sales of $9.4 million for the third quarter ended Sept.\n\n30, compared with revenue of $662,000 for the same period last year.\n\nNet losses at the company increased to $6.5 million, or 44\n\ncents per share, versus $5.6 million (51 cents) a year ago.\n\nFor the nine-month period, revenue increased to $18.8\n\nmillion, up from $755,000 in 1997, and losses rose to $17.9 million, an increase of 24\n\npercent from last year.\n\nThe nine-month loss did not include a dividend payout of\n\n$23.9 million, or $1.84 per share, which was recorded in connection with certain equity\n\nfinancing.\n\nThis was Terayon's first publicly reported quarter\n\nfollowing its $39 million initial public offering of stock in August.\n\nIncreased cable-modem shipments and growing acceptance of\n\nTerayon's S-CDMA (synchronous code-division multiple-access) technology spurred the\n\nrevenue increases, the company said.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Terayon shipped 17,500 modems and\n\n170 headends to new and existing customers, the company said in its earnings release. That\n\nbrought Terayon's total-to-date shipments to 34,500 modems and 327 headends, and it\n\nexpanded the company's total homes passed to 5 million.\n\nTerayon's customers include Cablevision Systems Corp.,\n\nCanada's Shaw Communications Inc. and TCA Cable TV Inc.\n\nIn addition, the company said it is currently conducting\n\ntrials with AT&T Corp.'s Advanced Communications Lab, running Internet-protocol\n\ntelephony over Terayon's cable modems. The tests will be expanded in the fourth\n\nquarter.\n\nThe company is also involved in technical trials with\n\nTele-Communications Inc., and it expects results from those in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhile the increase in sales is reflective of the boost in\n\nshipments of product, Terayon is also highly dependent on a few customers.\n\nRay Fritz, Terayon's chief financial officer, said at\n\nan analysts' conference call last Tuesday that 66 percent of the company's\n\nrevenue is tied to three customers -- Cablevision (28 percent), Shaw (24 percent) and\n\nJapan's Sumitomo Corp. (14 percent)."
