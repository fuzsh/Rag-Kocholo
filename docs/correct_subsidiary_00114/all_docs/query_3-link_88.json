        "text": "Fourteen years after the company's establishment and nine years since it went public on Nasdaq, Terayon has been sold. Brothers Zaki and Shlomo Rakib had raised $162.5 million for the company in two stock offerings to the public, and another half-billion dollars through selling convertible bonds. Terayon had bought one company after another, spending almost a billion dollars, and this is what Motorola is buying for just $140 million.\n\nThe Rakibs, who together own 11% of Terayon's shares (5.5% each), will be making $15.5 million cash on the deal.\n\nThe negotiations reportedly lasted months. Technology news site Light Reading had repeatedly reported on major lpayers eyeing Terayon: not only Motorola but Cisco Systems and Harmonic, attracted by the Israeli company's offerings of digital signal processing technology.\n\nMotorola is paying $1.80 per Terayon share. At the height of the bubble, Terayon had been selling at nearly $140 per share.\n\nThe Rakibs founded Terayon in 1993 to develop and manufacture modems for high-speed Internet surfing. In 1998 the company raised $39 million at its initial public offering on Nasdaq, at $13 per share. As the hi-tech bubble grew ever more distended, Terayon hit the marketplace again, raising $123.5 million at $39 per share.\n\nThe Rakibs, both schooled in technology, wanted to go beyond making modems. They hoped to turn Terayon into a sort of local Cisco, a one-stop shop for broadband communications products. They took advantage of the sky-high share price to buy up companies, using the share as capital. It spent $932 million buying companies but the strategy didn't work. In 2001 the company admitted that for the first time, writing off half a billion dollars in goodwill.\n\nZaki Rakib has served as chairman since 2004, when he stepped down as chief executive. Terayon hired an American as CEO: Jerry Chase. Shlomo Rakib served as chief technology officer from the company's foundation until 2004, since which time he's served on the board of directors.\n\nAs management changed, Terayon abandoned the low-margin modem market in favor of digital video. That is a hot area but meanwhile, Terayon's revenues have plunged. For the fourth quarter of 2006 Terayon reported a 42% dive in sales to $17.7 million, of which video solutions contributed $16.3 million. Year 2006 sales amounted to $76.4 million, down 16% against the year before.\n\nFor the year Terayon posted a loss of $3.3 million, and for the last quarter, $4.6 million.\n\nThe company was not much of a success story. Over the last decade, Terayon generated $1.31 billion in revenues, but lost $1.03 billion. As it changes hands, Terayon brings $20.3 million cash. Ergo, the company, once worth billions in market cap, is actually changing hands at $120 million."
