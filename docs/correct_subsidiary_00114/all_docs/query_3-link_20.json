        "text": "I've got a Motorola SB3100... and love it. Never had a problem with it and its been almost a year now. Know that doesn't answer your question, but I just thought I'd put my two cents in.\n\nlancity is a dead standard... any cable co using them will switch to docsis pretty soon.....but yes it does have it benefits\n\ni myself prefer the motorola SB3100, one thing... stay away from Com21 modems... they plain old suck ass..\n\nThe best cable modem is one you rent. Several dollars a month is cheaper than spending hundreds of dollars for technology than is changing. CompUSA, for example-you can get them cheaper, wants over $200 for a modem. Two hundred dollars divided by the rent, $4.00 a month, you would have to keep the modem over 4 years to break even. I don't thnk the sandards wil be te same in 4 years, do you???? R.\n\nI have that 3com modem that looks like a fish.\n\nwould I experience a real difference if I changed modems?\n\nit seems to work fine for me."
