        "text": "Verizon Communications, Inc.expand into digital subscriber line (DSL)-based voice and systems, Terayon Communication Systems Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) agreed to acquire Anchorage, AK-based Raychem Access Network Electronics (ANE), a division of Tyco Electronics Corp., itself a subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. (Exeter, NH). Terayon, a developer of broadband network systems, plans to acquire ANE for its DSL technology, which provides multiple phone lines per copper pair over the existing telephony network.\n\nWith over 500,000 DSL lines installed, ANE's customers include all the major U.S. Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs), including SBC Communications (San Antonio, TX), <%=company%> (New York), Bell South Corp. (Atlanta), US West (Denver, CO), and GTE Corp. (Irving, TX). With the explosion of the Internet, these and other U.S. carriers have experienced customer demand to provide incremental bandwidth to support both voice and data servicesâ€”a demand that DSL, particularly voice-over-DSL, can meet efficiently. Combined with the recent acquisition of Radwiz Inc. (Mahwah, NJ) for integrated DSL systems technology, the ANE product line will provide the market presence and scale to make Terayon a serious player in the growing U.S. DSL market, the company said.\n\nUnder terms of the agreement, Terayon common stock worth approximately $90 million will be exchanged for all outstanding shares of ANE. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and is expected to close in the second quarter of Terayon's fiscal year 2000. This acquisition has been approved by the board of directors of each company and is subject to various closing conditions."
