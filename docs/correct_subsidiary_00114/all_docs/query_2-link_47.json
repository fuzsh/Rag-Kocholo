You should read the entire prospectus carefully, including our financial statements and the risks of investing in our common stock discussed under \"Risk Factors\" before making an investment decision. References to \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" refer to GSI Technology, Inc.\n\nGSI Technology, Inc.\n\nWe design, develop and market high performance SRAM, or static random access memory, integrated circuits, or ICs, for the networking and telecommunications markets. We are a leading provider of Fast SRAM products, which perform at higher speeds and provide greater density than commodity SRAM products used in other applications. Within the Fast SRAM market, we focus on higher speed devices, or what we refer to as Ultra-Fast SRAMs, which are Fast SRAM ICs that require less than 5 nanoseconds to retrieve data from memory. We provide a broad range of advanced, highly reliable Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAM solutions that target high performance equipment, such as routers, switches, wireless local area network infrastructure equipment, wireless basestations and network access equipment. We believe our advanced circuit design expertise provides original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, with early access to next generation technologies, superior performance, advanced feature sets and high reliability, thereby enabling them to bring networking and telecommunications equipment to market quickly.\n\nWe work closely with leading networking and telecommunications OEMs to better anticipate their needs and gain insight into future technology requirements. Our products are used by leading OEMs in the networking and telecommunications markets, including Agilent Technologies, Alcatel, Cisco Systems, Huawei Technologies and Lucent Technologies. We rely on Cisco Systems for a significant portion of our net revenues. Due primarily to an increase in orders for our Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAM products, our net revenues increased from $21.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 to $35.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.\n\nGrowth in data, voice and video traffic has driven the need for greater networking bandwidth, resulting in the continued build-out of the networking and telecommunications infrastructure. This growth has led to the proliferation of a wide variety of networking equipment throughout the networking and telecommunications infrastructure. This equipment includes routers, switches, wireless local area network infrastructure equipment, wireless base stations and network access equipment. All of these products require Fast SRAM ICs, and OEMs are increasingly relying upon advanced SRAM technology to enable higher performance of their products.\n\nAs networking equipment must increasingly support advanced traffic content such as Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, and video streaming, networking and telecommunications OEMs are driving demand for even higher performance Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAM ICs. Networking and telecommunications OEMs are also under increasing pressure to bring these higher performance products to market rapidly. As a result, networking and telecommunications OEMs have increasingly relied on SRAM providers that offer a broad range of advanced Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAM ICs and who are capable of rapidly developing and introducing ICs that incorporate advanced feature sets.\n\nThrough the use of advanced architectures and design methodologies, we believe we are a technology leader in the development of Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAM ICs. The majority of our solutions have access speeds of less than 5 nanoseconds. By providing faster ICs, we enable our customers to design and develop higher performance products that support increasingly complex traffic content.\n\nWe currently offer 30 basic product configurations, which are the basis for over 2,500 individual products. Our broad product offering enables us to leverage our research and development to design\n\n3\n\nand develop our product lines to meet the precise and changing requirements of networking and telecommunications OEMs.\n\nOur products consume up to 50% less power than comparable products offered by our principal competitors. As a result, our products generate less heat, increasing the reliability of the networking equipment in which they are used. Furthermore, because of the low power requirements of our products, OEMs are able to add capabilities to their systems which otherwise might not have been possible due to overall system power constraints.\n\nOur designs enable multiple product families to be manufactured from a single die. This flexibility allows us to minimize manufacturing time and respond quickly to shipment requirements that are characteristic of the networking and telecommunications markets. Our flexible product designs also allow OEMs to reduce their cost and time-to-market by evaluating and qualifying one product configuration, enabling them to more easily qualify related products within the same product family. Additionally, our single die solution allows us to reduce our costs through better inventory management, the purchase of fewer mask sets, streamlining internal product qualifications, and more efficient use of engineering resources.\n\nOur products offer features that address a broad range of networking and telecommunications OEM system requirements. These proprietary features include a JTAG test port, which enables post assembly verification of the connection between our ICs and the system board, thereby allowing our customers to more rapidly develop, test and ship their products. Additionally, we offer our FLXDrive feature which allows the system designer to optimize signal performance for a given requirement. We provide OEMs the ability to use our ICs in various modes of operation using our flexible pin out structure, thus increasing product flexibility and availability. We also perform a full range of product reliability testing and comprehensively test all of our products at a wide range of extreme hot and cold temperatures, in addition to performing burn-in, to help assure high levels of quality and reliability.\n\nWe work with independent wafer foundries to manufacture our products in order to increase yields, lower manufacturing costs and enhance the quality of our products. This business model allows us to focus our resources on research and development, product design and marketing, while gaining access to advanced manufacturing process technologies without significant capital investments and the related fixed costs.\n\nOur objective is to become the leading provider of Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective include:\n\n\n\ncontinue to focus on the networking and telecommunications markets;\n\n\n\ncollaborate with wafer foundries to leverage leading-edge process technologies;\n\n\n\ncontinue to invest in research and development to extend our technology leadership;\n\n\n\nfocus on industry-leading OEMs; and\n\n\n\nleverage our core strengths to develop other product lines.\n\nWe were incorporated in California in 1995 under the name Giga Semiconductor, Inc. We changed our name to GSI Technology in December 2003 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 2004 under the name GSI Technology, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 2360 Owen Street, Santa Clara, California, 95054 and our telephone number is (408) 980-8388.\n\n4\n\nThe Offering\n\nCommon stock offered by:\n\nGSI Technology, Inc.\n\nshares Selling stockholders shares Total shares\n\nCommon stock to be outstanding after this offering\n\nshares\n\nUse of proceeds\n\nWe estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, without exercise of the overallotment option, will be approximately $ million.

You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nWe have incurred significant losses in prior periods and may incur losses in the future.\n\nWe incurred net losses of $670,000, $7.4 million and $2.1 million for fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, and we may incur additional losses in the future. Our business does not have an established record of profitability and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. In addition, we expect our operating expenses to increase as we expand our business. If our revenues do not grow to offset these expected increased expenses, our business will suffer. Our ability to increase our revenues depends on a number of factors, including:\n\n\n\nthe rate of growth of our target markets;\n\n\n\nthe continued market acceptance of the products of our end-users, the networking and telecommunications OEMs which incorporate our products into their equipment;\n\n\n\nthe competitive position of our products; and\n\n\n\nour ability to develop new products.\n\nYou should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as an indication of our future performance. In fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth, or our revenues could decline. Furthermore, if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\n\nUnpredictable fluctuations in our operating results could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nOur quarterly revenues, expenses and operating results have varied in the past and might vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. For example, in the last two fiscal years, we have recorded quarterly operating income of as much as $1.1 million and quarterly operating losses of as much as $2.3 million. We therefore believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance, and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance or the future performance of our stock price.\n\nOur expenses are, to a large extent, fixed, and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future. We will not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations. If this were to occur, our operating results would be harmed. If our operating results in future quarters fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors, the price of our common stock could fall.\n\nWe depend upon the sale of our Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs for all of our revenues, and a downturn in demand for our products could have a more disproportionate impact on our revenues than if we derived revenues from a more diversified product offering.\n\nWe derive all of our revenues from the sale of our Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs, and sales of these products will represent the substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our business depends in large part upon continued demand for our products in the markets we currently serve, and adoption of our products in new markets. Market adoption will be dependent upon our\n\n7\n\nability to increase customer awareness of the benefits of our products and to prove their high performance and cost effectiveness. We may not be able to sustain or increase our revenues from sales of our products, particularly if the networking and telecommunications markets enter into another downturn in the future. Any decrease in revenues from sales of our products could harm our business more than it would if we offered a more diversified line of products.\n\nWe are subject to the highly cyclical nature of the networking and telecommunications markets.\n\nOur products are incorporated into products used in the highly cyclical networking and telecommunications markets. In recent quarters, the networking and telecommunications markets have begun to emerge from an extended period of severe contraction. During this market contraction, our operating results sharply declined. Prior to this period of contraction, the networking and telecommunications markets experienced a period of rapid growth. During this period of growth, a number of new telecommunications and networking companies entered the market. These new companies raised significant amounts of capital, much of which they invested in new equipment, causing acceleration in demand for networking and telecommunications equipment, and hence, an increase in demand for our products. We expect that the networking and telecommunications markets will continue to be highly cyclical, characterized by periods of rapid growth and contraction. Our business and our operating results are likely to fluctuate, perhaps quite severely, as a result of this cyclicality.\n\nDownturns in the semiconductor industry may harm our business.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical. The industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies' and their customers' products and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. From time to time, the semiconductor industry also has experienced periods of increased demand and production capacity constraints.\n\nOur operating results may suffer during the down portion of these cycles. For example, the SRAM industry experienced significant declines in the average selling prices of SRAM products during the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry. We expect similar declines to occur in the future. Downturns in the semiconductor industry could cause our stock price to be volatile, and a prolonged decline in the industry could harm our operating results.\n\nThe average selling prices of our products are expected to decline, and if we are unable to offset these declines, our operating results will suffer.\n\nWe expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will be subject to significant pricing pressures. A reduction in average selling prices of our products could result in reduced revenues and lower gross margins on our products. Our ability to increase our net revenues and maintain our gross margins despite a decline in the average selling prices of our products will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to introduce lower cost versions of our existing products, increase unit sales volumes of these products, and introduce new products with higher prices. If we fail to accomplish any of these objectives, our business will suffer. To reduce our costs, we may be required to implement design changes that lower our manufacturing costs, negotiate reduced purchase prices from our foundries and assembly and test vendors, and successfully manage our manufacturing and subcontractor relationships. Because we do not operate our own wafer foundry or assembly facilities, we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own foundries or facilities.\n\n8\n\nA small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our net revenues. If any of our major customers reduce the amount they purchase or stop purchasing our products, our operating results will suffer.\n\nHistorically, a small number of customers and end-users have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues. A significant percentage of our sales are made to distributors and to contract manufacturers who incorporate our products into end products for systems manufacturers, including Cisco Systems. In fiscal 2004, SMART Modular Technologies, which operates consigned warehouses for Cisco Systems, accounted for 27.1% of our net revenues. During the same period, distributors Impact and Avnet Logistics accounted for 18.0% and 14.0%, respectively, of our net revenues. Purchases by Cisco Systems, the largest end-user of our products, represented approximately 25% to 30% of our net revenues in each of the past three fiscal years. Cisco Systems purchases our products directly, through our distributors, through its contract manufacturers and through SMART Modular Technologies.\n\nWe anticipate that our operating results in any given period will continue to depend, to a significant extent, upon revenues from a small number of end-users, distributors and contract manufacturers. We expect to continue to depend significantly on orders from our key end-users, particularly Cisco Systems, and our future success is dependent to a large degree on the business success of these end-users over which we have no control. We do not have long-term contracts with Cisco Systems, or our other major end-users, distributors or contract manufacturers that obligate them to purchase our products. If we fail to continue to sell to our key end-users, distributors or contract manufacturers in sufficient quantities, the growth of our business could be harmed. If a key end-user, distributor or contract manufacturer were to delay orders or payment or terminate its relationship with us, our business would be harmed.\n\nA small number of customers generally account for a significant portion of our accounts receivable in any period, and if any one of them fails to pay us, our operating results will suffer.\n\nA small number of customers generally account for a significant portion of our accounts receivable in any period, and if any of them fails to pay us, our operating results will suffer. For example, at March 31, 2004, SMART Modular Technologies, Avnet Logistics and Unique Technologies accounted for 17.2%, 16.9% and 14.7%, respectively, of our accounts receivable. If any of these customers do not pay us, our operating results will be harmed. Generally, we do not require collateral from our customers.\n\nThe market for Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs is highly competitive.\n\nThe market for Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs, which are used primarily in networking and telecommunications equipment, is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition. Several of our competitors offer broader product lines and have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any of these competitors. Our ability to compete successfully in this market depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including:\n\n\n\nreal or perceived imbalances in supply and demand of SRAMs;\n\n\n\nthe rate at which OEMs incorporate our products into their systems;\n\n\n\nthe success of our customers' products;\n\n\n\nour ability to develop and market new products;\n\n\n\naccess to advanced process technologies at competitive prices; and\n\n9\n\n\n\nthe supply and cost of wafers.\n\nIn addition, we are vulnerable to advances in technology used by competitors to offer products that feature higher performance, lower cost or lower power capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future as to any of these factors. Our failure to compete successfully in these or other areas could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and could contain defects, which could reduce revenues or result in claims against us.\n\nWe develop complex products. Despite testing by us and our end-users, design or manufacturing errors may be found in existing or new products. These defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. These defects may also cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, result in a delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and harm our relationships with our end-users. Our end-users could also seek and obtain damages from us for their losses. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend.\n\nIn addition, wafers and other components used in our products may contain defects that are not fully recoverable from our independent wafer foundries and other suppliers. For example, in the quarter ended March 31, 2003, we returned approximately $2.8 million of product to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and received a credit of $2.1 million, which required us to take a charge of approximately $700,000 to cost of revenues for manufacturing costs incurred in excess of the amount credited by TSMC.\n\nWe are dependent on the supply of wafers from independent foundries over which we have no control, and if we fail to obtain an adequate supply of wafers, our business will be harmed.\n\nTo produce our products, we require wafers that are manufactured by independent foundries over which we have no control. If we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers from our current or any alternative sources in a timely manner, our operating results will be harmed. Our ability to increase IC shipments is dependent on our ability to increase production through the allocation of increased wafer fabrication capacity by our existing foundries. To date, our principal manufacturing relationship has been with TSMC from which we have obtained a substantial majority of our wafers. We also receive wafers from WaferTech LLC, located in Washington. WaferTech is a subsidiary of TSMC. Each of our wafer foundries also supplies wafers to other IC companies, including our competitors. We do not have supply agreements with these manufacturers, and instead obtain manufacturing services on a purchase-order basis. Our manufacturers have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific product, in any specific quantity, at any specific price or for any specific time period. If these suppliers experience manufacturing failures or yield shortfalls, are disrupted by natural disaster or political instability, choose to prioritize capacity for other uses or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, we likely will not be able to enforce fulfillment of any delivery commitments. Our wafer foundries may be unable to supply us with sufficient quantities to meet all of our requirements. If this were to occur, we would have to allocate our products among our end-users which would constrain our growth and might cause some of them to seek alternative sources of supply. To increase our supply of wafers, we may seek to qualify additional manufacturing sources. The qualification process may take up to 12 months or longer and there is no assurance that we will be able to find and qualify another manufacturer. Moreover, it is uncertain whether additional manufacturing sources would agree to deliver an adequate supply of wafers to us.\n\n10\n\nBecause we outsource our wafer manufacturing and independent wafer foundry capacity is limited, we may be required to enter into costly long-term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity.\n\nWe do not have long-term supply agreements with our wafer foundries but instead obtain our wafers on a purchase order basis. In order to secure wafer supply from our current or future independent foundries, we may be required to enter into various arrangements with them, which could include:\n\n\n\ncontracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods;\n\n\n\ninvestments in and joint ventures with the foundries; or\n\n\n\nnon-refundable deposits with or prepayments or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments.\n\nWe may not be able to make any of these arrangements in a timely fashion or at all, and these arrangements, if any, may not be on terms favorable to us. Moreover, if we are able to secure independent foundry capacity, we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results.\n\nIf we are unable to offset increased wafer fabrication costs by increasing the average selling prices of our products, our operating results will suffer.\n\nIf there is a significant upturn in the networking and telecommunications markets which results in increased demand for our products and competing products, the available supply of wafers may be limited. As a result, we could be required to obtain additional manufacturing capacity in order to meet increased demand. Securing additional manufacturing capacity may cause our wafer fabrication costs to increase. If we are unable to offset these increased costs by increasing the average selling prices of our products, our gross margins will decline.\n\nAny significant order cancellations or order deferrals could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. Any significant cancellations or deferrals in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory, which could reduce our profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations. We generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer. If a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not pay for these products, we could miss future revenue projections or incur significant charges against our income, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\n\nDemand for our products may decrease if our end-users and contract manufacturers experience difficulty manufacturing, marketing or selling their products.\n\nOur products are used as components in our end-users' networking and telecommunications products. For example, Cisco Systems, our largest end-user, incorporates our products in a number of its networking routers and switches. Accordingly, demand for our products is subject to factors affecting the ability of our end-users and their contract manufacturers to successfully introduce and market their products, including:\n\n\n\ncapital spending by service providers and other enterprises who purchase our end-users' products;\n\n\n\nthe competition our end-users face in the networking and telecommunications industries;\n\n11\n\n\n\nthe technical, manufacturing, sales and marketing and management capabilities of our end-users and contract manufacturers;\n\n\n\nthe financial and other resources of end-users of our products and their contract manufacturers; and\n\n\n\nthe inability of our end-users to sell their products if they infringe third party intellectual property rights.\n\nIf demand for the products offered by our end-users or their contract manufacturers decreases, they may reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our business.\n\nIf we do not successfully develop new products to respond to rapid market changes due to changing technology and evolving industry standards, particularly in the networking and telecommunications markets, our business will be harmed.\n\nIf we fail to offer technologically advanced products and respond to technological advances and emerging standards, we may not generate sufficient revenues to offset our development costs and other expenses, which will hurt our business. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. In particular, the networking and telecommunications markets are rapidly evolving and new standards are emerging. We may experience development, marketing and other technological difficulties that may delay or limit our ability to respond to technological changes, evolving industry standards, competitive developments or end-user requirements. For example, because we have limited experience developing IC products other than Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs, our efforts to introduce new products may not be successful and our business may suffer. Other challenges that we face include:\n\n\n\nour products may become obsolete upon the introduction of alternative technologies;\n\n\n\nwe may incur substantial costs if we need to modify our products to respond to these alternative technologies;\n\n\n\nwe may not have sufficient resources to develop or acquire new technologies or to introduce new products capable of competing with future technologies;\n\n\n\nnew products that we develop may not successfully integrate with our end-users' products into which they are incorporated;\n\n\n\nwe may be unable to develop new products that incorporate emerging industry standards;\n\n\n\nwe may be unable to develop or acquire the rights to use the intellectual property necessary to implement new technologies; and\n\n\n\nwhen introducing new or enhanced products, we may be unable to manage effectively the transition from older products.\n\nWe may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and other more advanced manufacturing process technologies and that may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.\n\nIn order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition the manufacture of our products to smaller geometry process technologies. This transition will require us to migrate to new manufacturing processes for our products and redesign certain products. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance, and we have designed products to be manufactured using 90 nanometer geometry process technologies. We may experience difficulty in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes. These difficulties could result in\n\n12\n\nreduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We are dependent on our relationships with our wafer foundries to transition successfully to smaller geometry process technologies and to more advanced manufacturing processes. We cannot assure you that our wafer foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries. If we or our wafer foundries experience significant delays in this transition or fail to implement these transitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur products have lengthy sales cycles that make it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast results.\n\nOur products are generally incorporated in our end-users' products at the design stage. However, their decisions to use our products often require significant expenditures by us without any assurance of success, and often precede volume sales, if any, by a year or more. If an end-user decides at the design stage not to incorporate our products into their products, we will not have another opportunity for a design win with respect to that customer's product for many months or years, if at all. Our sales cycle can take up to 24 months to complete, and because of this lengthy sales cycle, we may experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development and our sales and marketing efforts and the generation of volume production revenues, if any, from these expenditures. Moreover, the value of any design win will largely depend on the commercial success of our end-user's products. There can be no assurance that we will continue to achieve design wins or that any design win will result in future revenues.\n\nOur business will suffer if we are unable to protect our intellectual property.\n\nOur success and ability to compete depends in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our proprietary rights. These agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement, or to protect us from the claims of others. In addition, we do not have any patents or registered trademarks. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Our attempts to enforce our intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly. Litigation may be necessary in order to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\n\nWe could become subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs.\n\nIf we infringe the proprietary rights of others, we could be forced to either seek a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon other's proprietary rights. Any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. In 2002, we settled patent litigation filed against us by one of our competitors, and obtained a license from that competitor in connection with the settlement. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical. Litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing others propriety rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any claims received in the future were to be upheld, the consequences to us would be severe and could require us to:\n\n\n\nstop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\n13\n\n\n\nobtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all;\n\n\n\npay damages; or\n\n\n\nredesign those products that use the disputed technology.\n\nIf we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, our business could be severely harmed.\n\nAs our business grows, such growth may place a significant strain on our management and operations and, as a result, our business might not succeed.\n\nOur ability to grow successfully requires an effective planning and management process. We plan to continue to expand our business and our growth could place a significant strain on our management systems, infrastructure and other resources. To manage our growth effectively, we must invest the necessary capital and continue to improve and expand our systems and infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner. Those resources might not be available when we need them, which would limit our growth. Our officers have limited experience in managing large or rapidly growing businesses. In addition, the majority of our management has no experience in managing a public company or communicating with securities analysts and public company investors. Our controls, systems and procedures might not be adequate to support a growing public company. If our management fails to respond effectively to changes in our business, our business might not succeed.\n\nOur international business exposes us to additional risks.\n\nProducts provided to our international customers accounted for 54.7% and 47.6% of our net revenues in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Moreover, a substantial portion of our products is manufactured and tested in Taiwan. We intend to expand our international business in the future. Conducting business outside of the United States subjects us to additional risks and challenges, including:\n\n\n\ncompliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\n\n\nlegal uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers;\n\n\n\npolitical and economic instability in, or foreign conflicts that involve or affect, the countries of our customers;\n\n\n\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\n\n\ndifficulties in staffing and managing personnel, distributors and representatives;\n\n\n\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\n\n\nfluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.\n\nMoreover, our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, a significant portion of our operating expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the new Taiwanese dollar. As a result, appreciation or depreciation of other currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar could result in material transaction or translation gains or losses that could reduce our operating results. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities.\n\n14\n\nOur third-party foundries and other subcontractors and many of our customers are located in the Pacific Rim, an area subject to significant earthquake risk and adverse consequences related to the outbreak of SARS and other epidemics.\n\nAll of the principal foundries that manufacture our products and all of the principal subcontractors that assemble and test our products are located in Taiwan. Many of our customers are also located in the Pacific Rim. The risk of an earthquake in these Pacific Rim locations is significant. The occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster near these foundries or subcontractors could result in damage, power outages and other disruptions that impair their production and assembly capacity. Any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembling, packaging or production testing from the affected contractor to another third-party vendor. While we have some foundry capacity in the United States, we may not be able to increase our foundry capacity in the United States, or obtain other alternate foundry capacity on favorable terms, if at all. The outbreak of SARS in the past curtailed travel to and from certain countries, primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, and limited travel within those countries. In addition, outbreaks of disease or other disasters could limit demand for our products.\n\nChanges in Taiwan's political, social and economic environment may affect our business performance.\n\nBecause much of the manufacturing and testing of our products is conducted in Taiwan, our business performance may be affected by changes in Taiwan's political, social and economic environment. For example, any political instability resulting from the relationship among the United States, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China could damage our business. Moreover, the role of the Taiwanese government in the Taiwanese economy is significant. Taiwanese policies toward economic liberalization, and laws and policies affecting technology companies, foreign investment, currency exchange rates, taxes and other matters could change, resulting in greater restrictions on our ability and our suppliers' ability to do business and operate facilities in Taiwan. If any of these risks were to occur, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and manage our indirect distribution channels.\n\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and manage our indirect distribution channels. Our existing or future channel distributors may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies. Since we sell through multiple channels and distribution networks, we may have to resolve potential conflicts between these channels. For example, these conflicts may result from the different discount levels offered by multiple channel distributors to their customers or, potentially, from our direct sales force targeting the same equipment manufacturer accounts as our indirect channel distributors. These conflicts may harm our business or reputation.\n\nWe are substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel.\n\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management and other key personnel, particularly our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President of Engineering. Loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives. Our management team must work together effectively in order to design our products, expand our business, increase our revenues and improve our operating results. We do not maintain key person insurance on any of our executive officers.\n\n15\n\nIf we are unable to recruit or retain qualified personnel, our business and product development efforts could be harmed.\n\nWe must continue to identify, recruit, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing and administrative personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. We may encounter difficulties in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified engineers, which could harm our ability to develop new products and adversely impact our relationships with existing and future end-users at a critical stage of development. The failure to recruit and retain necessary technical, managerial, sales, marketing and administrative personnel could harm our business and our ability to obtain new end-users and develop new products.\n\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and which may cause dilution to existing stockholders.\n\nWe may need to seek additional funding in the future. We do not know if we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, and we may be required to reduce operating costs which could seriously harm our business. In addition, if we issue equity securities, our stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock.\n\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\n\nBeing a public company will increase our administrative costs.\n\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that became law in July 2002, as well as new rules subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq National Market, have required significant changes in the corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and to make some activities more difficult, time consuming and/or costly. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have created several board committees and adopted additional internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. We have also retained a transfer agent, a bank note company and a financial printer, adopted an insider trading policy and will have all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws. We also expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These new rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\n\n16\n\nRisks Related to this Offering\n\nThere has been no prior market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may decline after this offering.\n\nBefore this offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock and the trading price of our common stock may decline below the initial public offering price. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that prevail in the trading market.\n\nAn active trading market may not develop and you may not be able to resell the shares you purchase at or above the initial public offering price, or at all. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\n\n\nactual or anticipated declines in operating results;\n\n\n\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\n\n\nannouncements by us or our competitors of financial results, new products, significant technological innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other events;\n\n\n\nthe gain or loss of significant orders or customers;\n\n\n\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\n\n\nmarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole.\n\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. Other companies in our industry and market are larger, established, publicly traded companies. As a result, it may be difficult for us to attract analyst coverage. If we should be unable to attract analyst coverage or if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company, our visibility in the financial market would suffer, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly.\n\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, which could harm our business or stockholders and result in litigation.\n\nIn recent years the stock market in general, and the market for technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. The market price of our common stock might experience significant fluctuations in the future, including fluctuations unrelated to our performance. These fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business relationships, our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or otherwise harm our business. In addition, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially acute for us because the extreme volatility of market prices of technology companies has resulted in a larger number of securities class action claims against them. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources. This could harm our business and cause the value of our stock to decline.\n\n17\n\nWe have no specific plan for the use of the net proceeds, and our investment of the net proceeds may not yield a favorable return.\n\nWe plan to use most of the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital. We may use the net proceeds in ways with which our stockholders may not agree or that prove to be disadvantageous to our stockholders. We may not be able to invest the net proceeds of this offering in a manner that yields a favorable return, which could harm our financial position and cause the value of our stock to decline.\n\nAfter this offering we will continue to be controlled by our executive officers, directors and major stockholders, whose interests may conflict with yours.\n\nUpon completion of this offering, our executive officers, directors and major stockholders will beneficially own approximately % of our outstanding common stock, based on shares outstanding as of March 31, 2004. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over or merging with us.\n\nThe provisions of our charter documents might inhibit potential acquisition bids that a stockholder might believe are desirable, and the market price of our common stock could be lower as a result.\n\nUpon completion of this offering, our Board of Directors will have the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock might delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders might be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock might result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. Our charter documents also contain other provisions which might discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition, including:\n\n\n\nonly one of the three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\n\n\nour stockholders have limited rights to remove directors without cause;\n\n\n\nour stockholders have no right to act by written consent;\n\n\n\nour stockholders have limited rights to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\n\n\nstockholders must comply with advance notice requirements to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\n\nThese provisions could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock. As a result, these provisions might prevent the market price of our common stock from increasing substantially in response to actual or rumored takeover attempts. These provisions might also prevent changes in our management.\n\nYou will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the book value of your shares.\n\nThe price for each share in the initial public offering is substantially higher than the book value per share of our outstanding common stock immediately after the offering. Accordingly, if you purchase common stock in the offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution of approximately $ in the book value of our common stock assuming an initial price of $ per share for our common stock.\n\n18\n\nIn addition, you will experience additional dilution upon the exercise of outstanding options, and options that may be granted in the future. As of March 31, 2004, there were 3,511,263 shares issuable upon the exercise of oustanding options with a weighted average exercise price of $2.63. We have also reserved an aggregate of 3,500,000 shares for future issuance under our 2004 equity incentive plan and 2004 employee stock purchase plan.\n\nThere are a large number of shares of our common stock that may be sold in the market following this offering, which may depress the market price of our common stock.\n\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the completion of this offering, or the perception that those sales could occur. These sales or the possibility that they may occur also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. The number of shares of common stock available for sale in the public market is limited by restrictions under federal securities laws. In addition, we and the holders of over 94% of our common stock, including all of our executive officers and directors, have agreed not to sell shares of our common stock without the consent of the underwriters for 180 days after the day of this prospectus. Merrill Lynch & Co. may, however, in its sole discretion and without notice, release all or any portion of the shares from the restrictions in these lock-up agreements.\n\nShares of our common stock will become eligible for future sale in the public market as follows:\n\nWe intend to register on a Form S-8 registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933 a total of approximately 3,500,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. As of March 31, 2004, there were outstanding options to purchase 3,511,263 shares of common stock, of which options to purchase 1,946,717 shares were vested and exercisable.\n\n19\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis prospectus includes forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition of our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, including among other things:\n\n\n\ngeneral economic and business conditions, both nationally and internationally;\n\n\n\nour expectations and estimates concerning future financial performance, financing plans and the impact of competition;\n\n\n\nanticipated trends in our business;\n\n\n\nexisting and future regulations affecting our business; and\n\n\n\nother risk factors set forth under Risk Factors in this prospectus.\n\nIn addition, in this prospectus, the words believe, may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, could, plan and similar expressions, as they relate to us, our business or our management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\n\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after the date of this prospectus. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\n\n20\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nAt an assumed public offering price of $ per share, we will receive $ million from our sale of shares of common stock in this offering, after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately $ million and the underwriting discount. At an assumed public offering price of $ per share, the selling stockholders will receive $ million from their sale of shares of our common stock in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount. We will not receive any portion of the net proceeds received by the selling stockholders from the sale of their shares. If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, we will receive an additional $ million in net proceeds at a public offering price of $ per share.\n\nThe principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, establish a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to public capital markets. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and research and development. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our current or future business and product lines; however, we have never made an acquisition and currently have no specific acquisitions planned. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending such uses, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in investment grade, interest-bearing securities.\n\nDIVIDEND POLICY\n\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock.

The pro forma net tangible book value of our common stock as of March 31, 2004 was $20.6 million, or $0.97 per share. Pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total assets, excluding net intangible assets, less our total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding, after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 15,120,168 shares of common stock. Dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by investors in this offering and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after the offering. After giving effect to our sale of shares of common stock in this offering, at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us, the pro forma net tangible book value of our common stock would have been $ million, or $ per share. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $ per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $ per share to new investors. The following table illustrates this per share dilution:\n\nAssumed initial public offering price $ Pro forma net tangible book value as of March 31, 2004 $ 0.97 Increase per share attributable to new investors Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value after the offering Dilution to new public investors $\n\nThe following table summarizes, on a pro forma as adjusted basis, as of March 31, 2004:\n\n\n\nthe number of shares of common stock purchased from us;\n\n\n\nthe total consideration paid to us;\n\n\n\nthe average price per share paid by existing stockholders; and\n\n\n\nthe price per share paid by new investors in this offering at an assumed public offering price of $ , before deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nShares Purchased Total Consideration Average Price\n\nPer Share Number Percent Amount Percent Existing stockholders 21,189,718 % $ 9,422,675 % $ 0.44 New investors Total 100.0 % $ 100.0 %\n\nIf the underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full, the number of shares held by new investors would increase to , or % of the total shares of common stock outstanding after this offering. After giving effect to the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option in full, the pro forma net tangible book value of our common stock would be $ million, or $ per share. This would represent an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $ per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $ per share to new investors.\n\nThe information in the above table excludes 3,511,263 shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding at March 31, 2004 under our 1997 and our 2000 stock option plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.63 per share. To the extent these options are exercised or, additional shares\n\n23\n\nare issued under these plans, there will be further dilution to the new investors.

Our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this prospectus. The following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a fabless semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAM ICs for the networking and telecommunications markets. We were founded in March 1995 to develop SRAMs targeted primarily at the personal computer, or PC, market. We shipped our first products in commercial volumes in fiscal 1998. During that year, we changed our focus from marketing commodity SRAMs in the highly competitive PC market and concentrated our efforts on the development of advanced Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs for the networking and telecommunications markets. Subsequent to fiscal 1998, product sales in these markets have represented approximately 80% to 90% of our net revenues. We are subject to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has experienced significant fluctuations, often in connection with fluctuations in demand for the products in which ICs are used. Beginning in fiscal 2001, the networking and telecommunications markets experienced an extended period of severe contraction. During this market contraction, our operating results sharply declined. In recent quarters, demand for networking and telecommunications equipment has accelerated and as a result, our operating results have improved.\n\nRevenues. Our revenues are derived from sales of our Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAM products. Sales to networking and telecommunications end-users accounted for 70% to 80% of our net revenues during our last three fiscal years. We also sell our products to end-users for professional audio applications such as sound mixing systems, to automotive end-users for applications such as smart cruise control and voice recognition systems, to test and measurement end-users for applications such as high-speed testers, and to defense contractors for applications such as radar and guidance systems. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, the selling prices of our products generally decline over the life of the product. Our ability to increase net revenues, therefore, is dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products with higher average selling prices in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of our more mature products. Our ability to increase unit sales volumes is dependent primarily upon increases in customer demand but, particularly in periods of increasing demand, can also be affected by our ability to increase production through the availability of increased wafer fabrication capacity by our independent wafer foundries and our ability to increase the number of integrated circuit die produced from each wafer through die size reductions and yield enhancement activities.\n\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force, international and domestic sales representatives and distributors. Revenues from product sales are generally recognized upon shipment, net of sales returns and allowances. Sales to distributors that have product return or price protection rights are recorded as deferred revenues for financial reporting purposes and recognized as revenues when the products are sold by the distributors to the end-user.\n\nHistorically, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenues, and we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Many of our end-users use contract manufacturers to manufacture their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues are derived from sales to these contract manufacturers and to consigned warehouses who purchase products from us for use by contract\n\n26\n\nmanufacturers. In addition, a significant portion of our sales are made to foreign and domestic distributors who resell our products to end-users, as well as their contract manufacturers. Direct sales to contract manufacturers and consigned warehouses accounted for 38.8%, 39.3% and 31.7% of our net revenues for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for 46.7%, 40.0% and 40.1% of our net revenues for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the periods indicated below, the following direct customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues:\n\nBased on information provided to us by contract manufacturers, consigned warehouses and distributors, purchases by Cisco Systems, the largest end-user of our products, represented approximately 25% to 30% of our net revenues in each of the past three fiscal years. Cisco Systems purchases our products directly, through our distributors and through its contract manufacturers and consigned warehouses. A consigned warehouse is an independent entity used by an OEM for the purpose of managing the OEM's inventory. Cisco Systems is our only end-user that purchases our products through a consigned warehouse.\n\nA significant portion of our net revenues are derived from sales to customers located outside the United States. The percentage of our net revenues by country are set forth in the following table:\n\nWe expect that as more of our OEM end-users move their operations overseas, particularly to China and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim, our net revenues derived from sales to customers located outside the United States will increase.\n\nCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of wafer fabrication costs, wafer sort, assembly, test and burn-in expenses and the cost of materials and overhead from operations. Substantially all of our manufacturing operations are outsourced. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to independent wafer foundries and contract assembly and test houses. Because we do not have long-term, fixed-price supply contracts, our wafer and other outsourced\n\n27\n\nmanufacturing costs are subject to the cyclical fluctuations in demand for semiconductors. As a result of the recent acceleration in demand for networking and telecommunications equipment, the related increase in demand for many of our lower density products, and our need to secure additional manufacturing capacity in an increasingly competitive market, we expect that our wafer fabrication costs will increase by approximately 10% for these lower density products over the next several quarters. Due to the strong demand for these products in the near term, we believe that we will be able to recover most, if not all, of these increased costs by increasing the selling prices of our products. Cost of revenues also includes expenses related to product engineering, supply chain management, quality assurance, final product testing and documentation control activities conducted at our headquarters in Santa Clara, California and our branch operations in Taiwan.\n\nA significant percentage of our Fast and Ultra-Fast SRAMs are manufactured by independent wafer foundries and subcontractors located in Taiwan. In the past we were subject to anti-dumping proceedings in which a competitor alleged that our Taiwan-manufactured products were being sold in the United States at less than their fair value. In April 1998, the United States Department of Commerce, or DOC, issued an anti-dumping order and imposed a duty of 12.1% of the value of our Taiwan-manufactured products imported for sale in the United States, retroactive to October 1997. The duty was subsequently increased to 51.3% on products imported for sale between October 1998 and March 1999. We continued to accrue duties at the rate of 51.3% on Taiwan-manufactured products imported for sale subsequent to March 1999. These duties were recorded as a cost of revenues as products subject to the duties were sold. In August 2000, the Court of International Trade issued a ruling that our Taiwan-manufactured products do not materially injure, or threaten to injure, the U.S. industry. In January 2002, the DOC revoked its anti-dumping order, retroactive to October 1997 and the United States Customs Service, or USCS, was ordered to refund, with interest, all duties deposited under the 1998 anti-dumping order. We had paid an aggregate of $3.9 million through the date of the refund order, of which $2.2 million had been charged to cost of revenues during the period from the 1998 anti-dumping order dated through March 31, 2001. The balance of the payments of $1.8 million were reclassified to a receivable from USCS on the date of the refund order. We received $3.5 million of refunds during the year ended March 31, 2002, of which $2.2 million was credited to cost of revenues, $396,000 was credited to interest income and $985,000 was credited to the receivable from USCS. We received $876,000 of refunds during fiscal 2003, of which $792,000 was credited to the receivable and $84,000 was credited to interest income.\n\nGross Profit. Our gross profit margins vary among our products and are generally higher on our higher density products and, within a particular density, higher on our higher speed and industrial temperature products. We expect that our overall gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, changes in average selling prices and our ability to control our cost of revenues, including costs associated with outsourced wafer fabrication and product assembly and testing. Although we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline over time, we believe that, over the next several quarters, our average selling prices, particularly with respect to our lower density products for which demand in recent quarters has increased, may hold steady or rise. As noted above, we also believe that we will be able to offset anticipated increases in manufacturing costs over the next several quarters by increasing the selling prices of our products.\n\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel, the cost of developing prototypes and fees paid to consultants. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long-term success, and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development activities. Accordingly, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in future periods, although such expenses as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate.\n\n28\n\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to independent sales representatives, salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing, administrative, finance and human resources activities, professional fees, costs associated with the promotion of our products and other corporate expenses. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our sales force. We also expect that, in support of our continued growth and our operations as a public company, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.\n\nStock-Based Compensation. In connection with the grant of stock options to employees between January 1997 and March 2004, we recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $349,000 in fiscal 2004, $678,000 in fiscal 2001, $3.9 million in fiscal 2000, $646,000 in fiscal 1999 and $416,000 in fiscal 1998, representing the difference between the deemed value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of grant. Deferred stock-based compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholder's equity, with straight-line amortization recorded over the vesting period that is typically four years. Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation is recorded as a charge against cost of revenues or operating expenses depending upon the classification of the employee receiving the underlying options. We amortized deferred stock-based compensation of $528,000 in fiscal 2004, $995,000 in fiscal 2003 and $1.4 million in fiscal 2002. The amount of the compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited.\n\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. We have incurred operating losses in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004. Due to operating losses incurred in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, we created a full valuation allowance in fiscal 2003 for deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance was based on our assessment of the uncertainty of the realizability of deferred tax assets which was due to our recent history of operating losses and our inability to conclude that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income would be generated in future periods to realize those deferred tax assets.\n\n29\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:\n\nYear Ended\n\nMarch 31, 2002 2003 2004 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 77.1 88.1 75.2\n\nGross profit\n\n22.9\n\n11.9\n\n24.8\n\nOperating expenses: Research and development 19.5 29.6 15.5 Selling, general and administrative 19.7 21.4 11.7\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n39.2\n\n51.0\n\n27.2\n\nLoss from operations\n\n(16.3\n\n)\n\n(39.1\n\n)\n\n(2.4\n\n) Interest and other income (expense), net 3.2 0.7 0.5\n\nLoss before income taxes\n\n(13.1\n\n)\n\n(38.4\n\n)\n\n(1.9\n\n) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (4.8 ) (2.9 ) \n\nNet loss\n\n(8.3\n\n)\n\n(35.5\n\n)\n\n(1.9\n\n)\n\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2003 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2004\n\nNet Revenues. Net revenues increased by 68.8% from $21.0 million in fiscal 2003 to $35.4 million in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to a 61.1% increase in unit sales as a result of increased demand from our networking and telecommunications end-users. The remaining increase was a result of the increase in the overall average selling price due to a shift in product mix to higher density products. We believe that this end-user demand increased as a result of a general improvement in the business environment and an increase in capital expenditures for networking and telecommunications equipment. We also believe that we increased our market share in fiscal 2004, particularly in the market for 9, 18 and 36 megabit SRAM products.\n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 44.1% from $18.5 million in fiscal 2003 to $26.6 million in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to the 61.1% increase in unit shipments, partially offset by various cost reduction measures. These cost reduction measures included the negotiation of price reductions for wafers purchased from our foundries, TSMC and WaferTech, and for assembly and test services provided by our contractors as well as enhancements to our internal test programs that resulted in more efficient test operations. In addition, we incurred a charge of approximately $700,000 in fiscal 2003 from the return of $2.8 million of product to TSMC, for which we received a credit of only $2.1 million.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased by 251.4% from $2.5 million in fiscal 2003 to $8.8 million in fiscal 2004. Gross margin increased from 11.9% of net revenues in fiscal 2003 to 24.8% in fiscal 2004. This increase in gross margin was primarily related to a shift in product mix, with a greater proportion of revenues being generated by our higher margin, higher density products. The cost reduction measures described above also contributed to the improvement in gross margin.\n\n30\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by 11.4% from $6.2 million in fiscal 2003 to $5.5 million in fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily due to a $423,000 reduction in legal expenses as a result of the settlement of patent litigation, a $265,000 reduction in prototype mask expenses and a $176,000 decrease in stock compensation expense. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in the number of our research and development personnel and increased expenditures for materials purchased for development projects currently in process.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 7.7% from $4.5 million in fiscal 2003 to $4.2 million for fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily related to reductions in payroll related expenses, stock compensation expenses and travel expenditures. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in commissions paid to manufacturers' representatives. Although total commissions increased due to the increase in net revenues, average commission rates decreased by approximately 35%.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income increased from $144,000 in fiscal 2003 to $182,000 in fiscal 2004. Net interest earned on invested cash balances decreased from $139,000 to $58,000 due to a decrease in average cash balances and lower interest rates. This decrease in interest income was offset by an increase of $116,000 in foreign exchange gains related to our Taiwan branch operations.\n\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes. The $620,000 benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2003 reflected a tax rate of 37.0% on our pre-tax losses offset by the full valuation allowance recorded in fiscal 2003 related to our deferred tax assets. There was no provision for income taxes in fiscal 2004 as a result of our pre-tax loss.\n\nNet Income (Loss). Our net loss decreased by 91.0% from $7.4 million in fiscal 2003 to $670,000 in fiscal 2004. This decrease was primarily due to the increased gross profit resulting from increased revenues and our improved gross margin.\n\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2002 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2003\n\nNet Revenues. Net revenues decreased by 15.3% from $24.8 million in fiscal 2002 to $21.0 million in fiscal 2003. This decrease primarily was the result of the downturn in the networking and telecommunications markets and the semiconductor industry generally and the excess supply of ICs. Unit shipments did not change significantly from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Average selling prices dropped significantly in each fiscal year.\n\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues decreased 3.4% from $19.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $18.5 million in fiscal 2003. The percent decrease in cost of revenues was less than the 15.3% decrease in net revenue as a result of the significant decrease in average selling prices due to the downturn in the networking and telecommunications markets, the resulting excess supply of ICs in these markets, and our inability to reduce product costs as rapidly as average selling prices decreased. In addition, in fiscal 2003, we returned approximately $2.8 million of product to TSMC as a result of quality issues and received a credit of $2.1 million which resulted in a charge of approximately $700,000 to cost of revenues for manufacturing costs incurred in excess of the amount credited by TSMC. In fiscal 2002, we charged $3.9 million, or 15.7% of net revenues, to cost of revenues primarily because the cost of a portion of our inventory exceeded the anticipated selling price of the related products. We received $3.5 million of refunds for previously paid anti-dumping duties during fiscal 2002 of which $2.2 million was credited to cost of revenues.\n\nGross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 56.0% from $5.7 million in fiscal 2002 to $2.5 million in fiscal 2003. Gross margin decreased from 22.9% in fiscal 2002 to 11.9% in fiscal 2003.\n\n31\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased by 29.2% from $4.8 million in fiscal 2002 to $6.2 million in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily related to a $450,000 increase in prototyping expenses and mask charges, a $343,000 increase in patent related legal expenses, a $271,000 increase in payroll related expenses, and a $143,000 increase in depreciation expense.
