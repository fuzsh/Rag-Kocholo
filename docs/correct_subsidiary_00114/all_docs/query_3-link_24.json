        "text": "The name Telegate became very hot last week, in the US, Israel, and at the Geneva Telecom Exhibition, where the company was sold to Terayon for $100 million.\n\nWhat wasn't mentioned in the official announcement of the deal were the details of Telegate's new $100 million contract, in a European country, to supply a cable company with equipment for installing a system to provide telephony services over cables.\n\nECI general manager David Rubner, who gave the details to \"Globes\", said that the contract had not yet been finally signed, only initialed. He was unwilling to disclose additional details, for example to name the country or the company.\n\nThe contract is in addition to Telegate's existing contract, also for $100 million, to supply Multigate systems to the Belgian cable company Telnet. Telnet is a subsidiary of US telephony company US West.\n\nThe initiative for founding Telegate cane from venture capital fund Veritex general manager and former Aryt general manager Yoram Oron. Telegate was founded in 1993 by current general manager Ehud Iloni. What distinguishes Telegate from other, similar Israeli companies that also operate in the cable modem field is the fact that its principal investors were strategic investors. The largest of these was ECI Telecom, which held 33% of Telegate at the time of the sale to Terayon, and which also marketed Telegate's products.\n\nThe agreement with Telnet was actually signed with ECI, not with Telnet directly. An additional investor was US General Instrument Corp., which developed products complementary to those of Telegate in the field of cable television, and was recently acquired by Motorola. The resulting situation was intolerable, since Motorola, which indirectly held part of Telegate, became, in the past year, one of its chief competitors in the cable television market, and hence was faced a conflict of interests.\n\nFor Terayon, too, this was a strategic investment. Telegate's Multigate product is actually based on a Terayon chip, and is not an independent development, so that the merger between Telegate and Terayon appears a natural one.\n\nWhat does Telegate do, and what makes its product so attractive? The company is currently one of very few that has developed a product to supply both data (Internet) and telephony on a cable network, while meeting international standards in the field. Motorola, for example, still lacks a modem for telephony, as do Israeli company NetGame and Nortel, which acquired the modem company LAN City through Bay Networks.\n\nIsraeli company Gad Line has a telephony modem and even advanced IP telephony development, but the company has established its own standard. Other Israeli companies in the field are Comvox and Shiron.\n\nMultigate is the name of Telegate's cable telephony modem. It is a home-office unit, which is installed for the consumer by the cable television company. The unit gives the subscriber the opportunity of simultaneously watching cable TV broadcasts, having a telephone conversation (using cable TV infrastructure), transmitting computer data or surfing the Internet.\n\nTelegate has more advanced developments, but these are intended solely for the European market. In Israel, Telegate has received a license from the Ministry of Communications to conduct a cable telephony trial with Golden Channels, which is being done on a small scale in Ramat Hasharon.\n\nTelegate's original product was launched in 1997. The product was initially analog; afterwards, a digital version was launched. In March 1999, Telegate announced MultiGate, the first system to enable wireless connection for telephone calls and Internet surfing over cable networks.\n\nDECT digital standard wireless telephones are very common in Europe and provide a solution for high quality wireless connectivity for a number of users in a home or small office environment. According to data from the research company Frost and Sullivan, 12 million DECT telephones are operating in European homes, and another million in the business sector. Frost and Sullivan predict that half of European businesses will have DECT systems by Y2001.\n\nMultigate DECT is remote operated by a service operator, which facilitates managing subscribers and installing and maintaining the system, without requiring technical knowledge from the subscriber.\n\nThe system serves two wireless lines with two telephone numbers, to which up to six wireless telephones can be connected at ranges up to 300 meters, in one unit. In addition, the system allows wireless communication with laptop computers, using DECT standard PC cards. The card allows the laptop computer user wireless access to the Internet and other information banks, fax reception and transmission, and video conference calls. Multigate DECT's rate of data transmission is 256 kbps (double the rate of an ISDN line).\n\nTelegate this week announced an additional development to enable cable TV service providers to supply their clients with combined wireless-cellular communications in one unit. Telegate's Multigate DECT-GSM combines the two most common wireless communications standards in Europe: GSM in the cellular market and DECT in the short-range wireless communication market.\n\nA cable TV supplier using Telegate's system will be able to penetrate the rapidly developing cellular market. The new system fits in with the rapidly developing trend towards combining fixed telephony services and wireless and cellular telephony, and provides long-standing telephony suppliers in one field with the opportunity to develop in the other fields.\n\nThe system will be unveiled for the first time at next week's London ECC Exhibition. Besides providing complete wireless-cellular telephone function, a Multigate DECT-GSM unit will offer all the capabilities of Multigate: cable TV, data communications, and high-speed connectivity with the Internet.\n\nA development unique to Telegate is the option of exploiting DECT for wireless data transmission between laptop computers and the Internet, using the new unit.\n\nTelegate's imagINe\n\nAnother field penetrated by Telegate is interactive video applications for the business sector, based on the use of cable TV networks. Last year, the company signed a cooperation agreement with the Israeli company imagINe, of the Nisco group, which develops video-based communication centers, intended for the financial and retail sectors.\n\nThe cooperation between the companies and the application of imagINe's new system will enable cable TV networks to be used not only for the home sector but also for the purpose of advanced application in the business sector.\n\nUsing PCs, connected to Telegate's Multigate communications unit and imagINe's Visual Meeting server, business users can obtain interactive voice, video, and data services, as well as consulting and support from the providers of various services.\n\nIn addition to conference calls, users can use the joint products of Telegate and imagINe for managing security systems with remote controlled video cameras, long-range selling of products and services, and more."
