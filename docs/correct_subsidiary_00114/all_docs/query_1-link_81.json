        "text": "Motorola agreed to acquire privately-held Leapstone Systems, a developer of communications software for service providers. Financial terms were not disclosed.\n\nLeapstone’s flagship Communications Convergence Engine (CCE) product suite is a real-time service delivery platform that enables fixed and mobile network operators to expand and evolve their service offerings through its Service Broker and Content Manager software products.\n\nLeapstone’s service brokering approach acknowledges that services will be developed by multiple vendors, run on different platforms and require various protocol interfaces. CCE serviceBROKER is not tightly coupled with any particular application creation technology.\n\nThe Leapstone platform is aligned with the IMS architectural framework and has been licensed by AT&T and Verizon Wireless, among others.\n\n“Leapstone will contribute its leading intelligent service delivery and content management platform to Motorola, which will serve as our new engine for enabling seamless mobility experiences across applications, devices and domains,” said Dan Moloney, President, Motorola Home & Networks Mobility.\n\nhttp://www.leapstone.com/http://www.motorola.com"
