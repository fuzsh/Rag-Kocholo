[ Alternative Formats ]\n\nPreliminary Information Statement of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInformation contained herein is subject to completion or amendment. A Registration Statement on Form 10 relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nPreliminary Information Statement\n\n(Subject to Completion, Dated October 8, 2010)\n\nInformation Statement\n\nDistribution of Common Stock of\n\nMotorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.\n\nby\n\nMOTOROLA, INC.\n\nto Motorola, Inc. Stockholders\n\nThis Information Statement is being furnished in connection with Motorola, Inc.’s distribution of all of the shares of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. (“Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.,” “Motorola Mobility” or the “Company”) common stock owned by Motorola, Inc., which will be 100% of Motorola Mobility’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the distribution. Motorola Mobility is a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola, Inc. that at the time of the distribution will hold, through its subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities associated with Motorola, Inc.’s mobile devices (“Mobile Devices”) and home (“Home”) businesses. The main U.S. operating subsidiary of Motorola Mobility will be Motorola Mobility, Inc. To implement the distribution, Motorola, Inc. will distribute the shares of Motorola Mobility common stock on a pro rata basis to the holders of Motorola, Inc. common stock. Each of you, as a holder of Motorola, Inc. common stock, will receive [—] share of common stock of Motorola Mobility for each share of Motorola, Inc. common stock that you held at the close of business on [—], 201[—], the record date for the distribution. The distribution will be made in book-entry form. Motorola, Inc. will not distribute any fractional shares of Motorola Mobility. Instead, the distribution agent will aggregate fractional shares into whole shares, sell the whole shares in the open market at prevailing rates and distribute the net cash from proceeds from the sales pro rata to each holder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive fractional shares in the distribution.\n\nThe distribution will be effective as of [—], 201[—]. Immediately after the distribution is completed, Motorola Mobility will be an independent, publicly traded company. It is expected that the distribution will be tax-free to Motorola, Inc. stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent cash is received in lieu of fractional shares.\n\nOn the date of the distribution, Motorola, Inc. intends to change its name to Motorola Solutions, Inc. Please refer to the “Note Regarding the Use of Certain Terms” included elsewhere in this Information Statement for a description of how we refer to Motorola, Inc., Motorola Solutions, Inc. and Motorola Mobility in this Information Statement.\n\nWe are not asking you for a proxy and you are requested not to send us a proxy.\n\nNo vote of Motorola, Inc. stockholders is required in connection with this distribution. You are not required to send us a proxy card. Motorola, Inc. stockholders will not be required to pay any consideration for the shares of Motorola Mobility common stock they receive in the distribution, and they will not be required to surrender or exchange shares of their Motorola, Inc. common stock or take any other action in connection with the distribution. From and after the distribution, certificates representing Motorola, Inc. common stock will represent Motorola Solutions, Inc. common stock as a result of Motorola, Inc.’s name change.\n\nAll of the outstanding shares of Motorola Mobility’s common stock are currently owned by Motorola, Inc. Accordingly, there currently is no public trading market for our common stock. We intend to file an application to list our common stock and expect to list under the ticker symbol MMI on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Assuming that Motorola Mobility’s common stock is approved for listing, we anticipate that a limited market, commonly known as a “when-issued” trading market, for Motorola Mobility’s common stock will develop on or shortly before the record date for the distribution and will continue up to and including through the distribution date, and we anticipate that the “regular-way” trading of Motorola Mobility’s common stock will begin on the first trading day following the distribution date.\n\nIn reviewing this Information Statement, you should carefully consider the matters described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 13 of this Information Statement.\n\nNeither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of any of the securities of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. or determined whether this Information Statement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.\n\nThis Information Statement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.\n\nThe date of this Information Statement is , 2010.\n\nThis Information Statement was first mailed to Motorola, Inc. stockholders on or about , 2010.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPage\n\nSummary\n\n1\n\nOur Business\n\n1\n\nThe Separation\n\n2\n\nQuestions and Answers About Motorola Mobility and the Separation\n\n3\n\nSummary of the Separation and Distribution\n\n9\n\nSelected Financial Data\n\n12\n\nRisk Factors\n\n13\n\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\n13\n\nRisks Relating to the Separation\n\n29\n\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n\n35\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\n37\n\nThe Separation\n\n39\n\nGeneral\n\n39\n\nReasons for the Separation\n\n39\n\nFormation of a Holding Company Prior to Our Distribution\n\n40\n\nThe Number of Shares You Will Receive\n\n40\n\nTreatment of Fractional Shares\n\n40\n\nWhen and How You Will Receive the Dividend\n\n41\n\nTreatment of Equity-Based Compensation\n\n41\n\nTreatment of 401(k) Shares for Current and Former Employees\n\n42\n\nResults of the Distribution\n\n43\n\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution\n\n43\n\nMarket for Common Stock\n\n45\n\nTrading Between the Record Date and Distribution Date\n\n46\n\nConditions to the Distribution\n\n46\n\nReason for Furnishing This Information Statement\n\n47\n\nDividend Policy\n\n47\n\nCapitalization\n\n48\n\nBusiness\n\n49\n\nGeneral\n\n49\n\nBusiness Segments\n\n50\n\nOther Information\n\n57\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\n61\n\nManagement\n\n65\n\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\n\n73\n\nNamed Executive Officer Compensation\n\n96\n\nEmployment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements\n\n108\n\nSecurity Ownership of Management, Directors and Principal Stockholders\n\n118\n\nCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\n\n121\n\nThe Separation from Motorola, Inc.\n\n121\n\nRelated Party Transactions\n\n121\n\nAgreements with Motorola, Inc.\n\n122\n\nDescription of Capital Stock\n\n131\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPage\n\nWhere You Can Find More Information\n\n135\n\nUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements\n\n136\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n141\n\nIntroduction\n\n141\n\nSeparation from Motorola, Inc.\n\n141\n\nExecutive Overview\n\n142\n\nLooking Forward\n\n146\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\n147\n\nResults of Operations\n\n148\n\nSix Months Ended July 3, 2010 and July 4, 2009\n\n148\n\nCombined Business Results\n\n148\n\nSegment Results\n\n150\n\nReorganization of Businesses\n\n152\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n155\n\nYears Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007\n\n160\n\nCombined Business Results\n\n160\n\nSegment Results\n\n165\n\nReorganization of Businesses\n\n168\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n172\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n176\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n187\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\nF-1\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNOTE REGARDING THE USE OF CERTAIN TERMS\n\nWe use the following terms to refer to the entities indicated:\n\n“We,” “us,” “our,” “our Company,” “the Company” and “Motorola Mobility” refer to Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc., the entity that at the time of the distribution will hold, through its subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities associated with the Mobile Devices and Home businesses of Motorola, Inc. and whose shares will be distributed in the distribution.

A sale of the majority of the Networks business’s assets to Nokia Siemens Networks is expected to be completed in late 2010 or early 2011 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. If the Networks sale is completed prior to the distribution then Motorola Solutions, Inc. will be comprised solely of Enterprise Mobility Solutions.\n\n“Separation” or “separation” refers to the separation of the Mobile Devices and Home businesses from Motorola, Inc. and the creation of an independent, publicly traded company holding the Mobile Devices and Home businesses through a distribution of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. shares to the Motorola, Inc. stockholders as of the record date.\n\n“Distribution” or “distribution” refers to the distribution of all of the shares of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. common stock owned by Motorola, Inc. to stockholders of Motorola, Inc. as of the record date.\n\n“Distribution Date” means the date on which the Distribution occurs.\n\nFor reference, acronyms used in this document are defined in the below table.\n\n2G\n\nSecond Generation Cellular\n\n3G\n\nThird Generation Cellular\n\n3D-TV\n\nThree Dimensional Television\n\n4G\n\nFourth Generation Cellular\n\n802.11\n\nWireless Local Area Network Set of Standards\n\nARPU\n\nAverage Revenue Per User\n\nASP\n\nAverage Selling Price\n\nATSC\n\nAdvanced Television Systems Committee\n\nCAGR\n\nCompound Annual Growth Rate\n\nCD&A\n\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\n\nCDMA\n\nCode Division Multiple Access\n\nCMTS\n\nCable Modem Termination System\n\nCPE\n\nCustomer Premises Equipment\n\nDGCL\n\nDelaware General Corporation Law\n\nDOCSIS\n\nData Over Cable Service Interface Specification\n\nDRM\n\nDigital Rights Management\n\nDSL\n\nDigital Subscriber Line\n\nDSU\n\nDeferred Stock Units\n\nDVR\n\nDigital Video Recorder\n\nEMEA\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\nESP\n\nEstimated Selling Price\n\nExSP\n\nExecutive Severance Plan\n\nEVDO\n\nEvolution Data Optimized\n\nFASB\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board\n\nFCC\n\nFederal Communications Commission\n\nFOU\n\nField of Use\n\nGbps\n\nGigabits per second\n\nGSM\n\nGlobal System for Mobile Communications (cellular telephone standard based on European specifications; ETSI 2nd generation standard)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nH.264\n\nStandard for Video Compression\n\nHD\n\nHigh Definition\n\nHD DVR\n\nHigh Definition Digital Video Recorder\n\nHDTV\n\nHigh Definition Television\n\nHSDPA\n\nHigh Speed Downlink Packet Access\n\nHSUPA\n\nHigh Speed Uplink Packet Access\n\nHSOPA\n\nHigh Speed Orthogonal Frequency—Division Multiplexing Packet Access\n\nHSxPA\n\nA generic term referencing either HSDPA, HSUPA, or HSOPA\n\niDEN\n\nIntegrated Digital Enhanced Network\n\nIMS\n\nIMS Research\n\nIRD\n\nIntegrated Receiver Decoder\n\nIP\n\nInternet Protocol\n\nIPTV\n\nInternet Protocol Television\n\nIRS\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\nITC\n\nInternational Trade Commission\n\nLRIP\n\nLong-Range Incentive Plan\n\nLTE\n\nLong-Term Evolution\n\nLTI\n\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\n\nMbps\n\nMegabits Per Second\n\nMDb\n\nMobile Devices business\n\nMIP\n\nMotorola, Inc.

All rights reserved.\n\nINDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA\n\nIn this Information Statement, we rely on and refer to information and statistics regarding the wireless mobile device and home industries. We obtained this data from independent publications or other publicly available information. Although we believe these sources are reliable, we have not independently verified and do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of this information.\n\nAll industry and statistical information included in this Information Statement, other than information derived from our financial and accounting records, is presented as of August 31, 2010, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Information Statement. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: (1) risks relating to our business, (2) risks relating to the separation, and (3) risks relating to our common stock. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\nWe have had substantial operating losses in each of the last three years and may continue to incur losses.\n\nIn each of the last three years, Motorola Mobility had substantial operating losses as a result of the financial performance of our Mobile Devices business. We cannot be certain that we will return to profitability in the near-term.\n\nIn 2009, the telecommunication and cable industries were impacted by the global reduction in capital and consumer spending and our financial performance could be negatively impacted if capital and consumer spending does not substantially improve.\n\nIn 2009, the telecommunications and cable industries were impacted by the global reduction in capital spending and consumer spending. As a result, both industries contracted. Our financial plans anticipate the wireless mobile device market to grow in 2010 and some continued contraction in the cable industry. Our financial performance could be negatively impacted if our expectations for our industries are not correct.\n\nWe operate in an extremely competitive environment and our success depends in part on our timely introduction of, and effective investment in, new competitive products, and technologies and services, the failure of which could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe operate in an extremely competitive environment and the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards. The convergence of the telecommunication, data and media industries which is driven by technological development related to Internet protocol (“IP”) based communications is driving rapid change in our industries. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive to develop and bring to market. Our success depends, in substantial part, on the timely and successful introduction of new products, services and upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing technological and product developments by our competitors. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends and customer needs. We may focus our resources on technologies that do not become widely accepted, are not timely released or are not commercially viable. In addition, our products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment. If our products are not competitive or do not work properly, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.\n\nOur results are subject to risks related to our significant investment in developing and introducing new products and services, such as advanced wireless mobile devices, including smartphones, and products for transmission of telephony and high speed data over hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems. These risks include: (1) difficulties and delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of products, (2) customer\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\nacceptance of products, (3) the development of, approval of and compliance with industry standards, (4) the significant amount of resources we must devote to the development of new technologies, and (5) the ability to differentiate our products and compete with other companies in the same markets.\n\nWe have several large customers and the loss of, or a significant reduction in revenue from, one or more of these customers could have a negative impact on our business.\n\nDuring 2009, approximately 17% of our net revenues were from Verizon Communications Inc. (including Verizon Wireless) (“Verizon”) and approximately 13% of our net revenues were from Sprint Nextel Corporation (“Sprint Nextel”). In 2009, Verizon was the single largest customer of both of our businesses. It may be difficult to replace or find new large customers, especially in the U.S. where there are a limited numbers of carriers. If any significant customer, particularly Verizon or Sprint Nextel or other large customers, such as Comcast, stopped doing business with us, or significantly reduced the level of business they do with us, it could impact our ability to service other customers using similar technology and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\n\nOur contracts with wireless carriers do not provide for long-term guaranteed volumes of purchases or exclusivity and are cancellable by our customers with little, if any, notice. Our financial results could be negatively impacted as a result of doing business with wireless carriers under these types of arrangements.\n\nWe sell substantially all of our handsets to wireless carriers. Currently, we do not have long-term exclusivity arrangements with our customers or commitments by them to purchase guaranteed volumes. Moreover, our customers can cancel orders or contracts with us with little, if any, notice. Some of our current competitors have more favorable contractual arrangements with some wireless carriers, including exclusivity arrangements. These more favorable contractual arrangements have given our competitors competitive advantages. Our financial results could be negatively impacted as a result of doing business with wireless carriers under these types of arrangements.\n\nWe have lost significant market share in our Mobile Devices business and such loss has negatively impacted our performance and could continue to negatively impact our financial results.\n\nOur share of the worldwide wireless mobile device market has declined significantly in the last several years. While we reduced our costs during this period of time, our significantly lower sales volume and the resulting market share declines have had a negative impact on our financial results. Although our primary focus is profitable growth, if our global market share of smartphone shipments does not increase, our strategy to return our Mobile Devices business to profitability could be negatively impacted.\n\nIf our current product strategy and operating system strategy are not successful, our Mobile Devices business could be negatively impacted.\n\nOur current strategy is to concentrate our mobile devices portfolio on smartphones and to use third-party and/or open-source operating systems and associated application ecosystems, predominantly the Google™ Android operating system (a royalty-free open-source platform) and marketplace, in our wireless products. As a result, we are dependent on third-parties’ continued development of operating systems, software application ecosystem infrastructures and such third-parties’ approval of our implementations of their operating system and associated applications. If we had to change our strategy, our financial results could be negatively impacted because a resulting shift away from using Android and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult. A strategy shift could increase the burden of development on Motorola Mobility and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time, which could competitively disadvantage Motorola Mobility.\n\nWe are at risk if Android-based smartphones do not remain competitive in the marketplace. Even if Android-based smartphones remain competitive, the Android operating system is an open-source platform and many other companies sell competing Android-based smartphones. If the Android-based smartphones of our competitors are more successful than ours, our financial results could be negatively impacted. It is also critical to\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthe success of the Android operating system that third-party developers continue to develop and offer applications for this operating system that are competitive with applications developed for other operating systems. From an overall risk perspective, the industry is currently engaged in an extremely competitive phase with respect to operating system platforms, applications and software generally. If Android does not to continue to gain operator and/or developer adoption, or any updated versions or new releases of Google’s Android operating system or applications are not made available to Motorola Mobility in a timely fashion, Motorola Mobility could be competitively disadvantaged and Motorola Mobility’s financial results could be negatively impacted.\n\nAs part of our ongoing effort to improve the product portfolio of our Mobile Devices business, we also have been rationalizing our hardware platforms to reduce the complexity of our product platforms and system architecture. This allows us to lower our costs to develop and produce mobile devices and to enable richer consumer experiences. Failure to continue to execute on these rationalization plans in a timely and effective manner could cause us to be competitively disadvantaged in many areas, including but not limited to, cost, time-to-market and the ability to ramp-up production in a timely fashion with acceptable quality and improved/additional features.\n\nWe have identified priority markets as we introduce our new smartphone products and rebuild our business and our Mobile Devices business could be negatively impacted if we are not successful in these priority markets or are unable to succeed in other markets.\n\nOur current priority markets for our new smartphones are North America and China, followed by Western Europe, Latin America and other parts of Asia. Our ability to rebuild our business so that we can expand into more markets and achieve the scale we need to be profitable is highly dependent on our initial success in North America and China. While North America has traditionally been our strongest market and we have been successful in China, we face intense competition in both markets, and there can be no assurance that we can achieve the levels of sales and profitability in these markets that we will need to continue to rebuild our business and expand our markets.\n\nOur future financial results may be negatively impacted if we do not execute on our Original Design Manufacturer (“ODM”) strategy of delivering low- to mid-tier voice-centric products.\n\nWe rely on ODMs to develop and manufacture our low- to mid-tier voice-centric mobile products. However, customer demand for these products in these locations could exceed the ODMs’ development capabilities, manufacturing capacity and/or material availability which could negatively impact our operating results. A significant quality issue could disrupt plans to launch products into these markets and result in cancelled orders and missed sales opportunities. In addition, commercial terms with our ODMs could be less favorable on future devices making these products more expensive to produce and, consequently, less competitive in these markets, negatively impacting our sales and operating results.\n\nThe effects of Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations requiring separation of security functionality from set-top boxes could negatively impact our sales of set-top boxes to cable providers.\n\nHistorically, reception of digital television (“TV”) programming from a cable broadband network required a set-top box with security technology. Traditionally, cable service providers leased their set-top boxes to their customers. This security technology limited the availability of set-top boxes to those manufactured by a few cable network manufacturers, including Motorola Mobility. In 2007, FCC regulations requiring separation of security functionality from set-top boxes became effective. This has increased competition for sales of set-top boxes to cable operators and enabled retail distribution of set-top boxes. Moreover, it also enabled retail distribution of televisions with other video devices capable of accessing encrypted cable programming. Several major cable operators are working to support full two-way security interface architecture that allows retail customers access to all programming available on a cable operator’s network without the need for a set-top box. In addition, a few television and video device manufacturers have begun shipping or are developing such devices. If either of these strategies achieve a meaningful volume of sales it could negatively impact Motorola Mobility’s sales of set-top boxes.\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe AllVid/Smart Video Notice of Inquiry currently in process by the FCC is exploring standardization of interfaces, protocols and operations related to set-top boxes and gateways. While the process is in its infancy and no decisions have been made, future rules adopting some or all of the proposed standards could negatively impact our set-top box business.\n\nWe have taken significant cost-reduction actions, which may expose us to additional production risk and could have a negative impact on our sales, profitability and ability to attract and retain employees.\n\nWe have been reducing costs and simplifying our product portfolios in our businesses, with sizable reductions in our Mobile Devices business. We have discontinued product lines, consolidated manufacturing operations, increased reliance on third-parties, reduced our employee population and changed our compensation and benefits programs.\n\nThe impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, (2) our ability to generate the remaining level of cost savings we expect, (3) delays in implementing anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, (4) decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, (5) our ability to retain or recruit key employees, (6) the adequacy of our manufacturing capacity, including capacity provided by third-parties, (7) the performance of other parties under contract manufacturing arrangements on which we rely for the manufacture of certain products, parts and components, and (8) possible litigation or other third-party intervention.\n\nOur business has consolidated or exited certain facilities and our products are manufactured in fewer facilities than in the past. While we have business continuity and risk management plans in place in case capacity is significantly reduced or eliminated at a given facility, the reduced number of alternative facilities could cause the duration of any manufacturing disruption to be longer or more severe. As a result, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits could decline.\n\nWe face many risks relating to intellectual property rights.\n\nOur business could be harmed if: (1) we, our customers and/or our suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property rights of third-parties, (2) the intellectual property indemnities in our supplier agreements are inadequate to cover damages and losses we suffer due to infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our suppliers’ products, (3) we are required to indemnify our customers for significant amounts under agreements providing for intellectual property indemnities that have been entered into with some of our customers, (4) our intellectual property protection is inadequate to protect our proprietary rights, (5) the indemnity rights passed through by our customers are insufficient, or (6) our competitors negotiate significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property. We may be harmed if we are forced to make publicly available, under the relevant open-source licenses, certain internally developed software related intellectual property as a result of either our use of open-source software code or the use of third-party software that contains open-source code. Our intellectual property protection could be limited due to the use of such open-source software code in our products.\n\nIntellectual Property Infringement Risks\n\nBecause our products are comprised of complex technology, we are often involved in or impacted by assertions, including both requests to take licenses and litigation, regarding infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights of third-parties. Third-parties have asserted, and in the future may assert, intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our customers and suppliers. These assertions against us and our customers and suppliers have become more frequent as the complexity of our products and the intensity of competition in our industry has increased. Increasingly, many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing based revenue from product manufacturing companies. The patent holders often make broad and sweeping claims regarding the applicability of their patents\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nto our products and the products of our customers and suppliers, seeking a percentage of sales or a percentage of downstream customer revenues as license fees, or seeking injunctions to pressure us, our customers and suppliers into taking a license, or a combination thereof. Defending claims, including pursuant to indemnity obligations, may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees. Increasingly, third-parties have sought broad injunctive relief by filing claims in the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) which could limit our ability to sell our products in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. If we do not succeed in such litigation, we could be required to expend significant resources to pay damages, to develop non-infringing products or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of such litigation, each of which could have a negative impact on our financial results. We cannot be certain that any such licenses, if available at all, will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. In some cases, we might be forced to stop delivering certain products if we or our customers or suppliers are subject to a final injunction.\n\nIntellectual Property Indemnity Risks\n\nWe attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities with our suppliers for infringement by their products of third-party intellectual property rights. However, certain suppliers require us to provide intellectual property infringement indemnification or provide limited or no intellectual property infringement indemnities to us in existing contracts. There is no assurance that we will be successful in our future negotiations, that a supplier’s indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers due to any infringing products, or that a supplier may choose to accept a license or modify or replace its products with non-infringing products which would otherwise mitigate such damages and losses. Further, we may not be able to participate in intellectual property litigation involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any ultimate resolution or outcome that could negatively impact our sales if a court enters an injunction against the supplier’s products or if the ITC issues an exclusionary order that blocks our products from importation into the U.S. that contain their components or software. As our volumes of Android-based smartphones increase, we could be affected if a third-party successfully asserted an intellectual property infringement claim against our supplier, Google, and the supply of Android software for our products were limited or foreclosed.\n\nIn addition, our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify them broadly from damages and losses resulting from intellectual property litigation against them relating to our products. Customers may also demand third-party content without providing sufficient pass-through indemnities. Because our customers often derive much larger revenue streams by reselling or leasing our products than we generate from the sale of our products to them, these indemnity claims by our customers have the potential to expose us to damages that are much higher than we would be exposed to if we were sued directly.\n\nIntellectual Property Protection Risks\n\nOur patent and other intellectual property rights are important competitive tools that we use to generate income under license agreements or to give us a competitive advantage over our competitors. We regard our intellectual property as proprietary and attempt to protect it with patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and other methods. We also generally restrict access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar technology independently. In the course of litigation, courts may also invalidate our intellectual property rights. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third-parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our business.\n\nIntellectual Property Competition Risks\n\nAs we expand our business, including through acquisitions, and compete with new competitors in new markets, the breadth and strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new areas may not be as developed as in our longer standing businesses. This may expose us to a heightened risk of litigation and other\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nchallenges from competitors in these new markets. Further, competitors may be able to negotiate significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property than we are able to, which would put them at a competitive advantage.\n\nIntellectual Property Separation Risks\n\nAs a business segment of Motorola, Inc., we are the beneficiary of certain of Motorola, Inc.’s intellectual property licensing arrangements with respect to technology incorporated in our products and used to operate our businesses, including cross-licensing arrangements with leading telecommunications equipment companies, various royalty bearing license agreements, and other licensing agreements entered into with third-parties. Some of these agreements are assignable unilaterally by Motorola, Inc., while the assignment of others may be subject to consent or other conditions. We expect to seek assignments of some of these agreements, as well as to enter into our own agreements and arrangements with certain third-parties, with respect to intellectual property and technology that is important to our business and that was previously licensed through Motorola, Inc. It is possible that some third-parties may use the requirement of a consent or a new agreement to seek to obtain more favorable contractual terms or refuse to enter into a new arrangement. In addition, there may be third-parties who have refrained from asserting intellectual property infringement claims against our products while we were a business segment of Motorola, Inc. that elect to pursue such claims against us after our separation from Motorola, Inc. Failure to retain or secure licenses on terms and conditions as favorable as those secured by our competitors or those we have enjoyed while part of Motorola, Inc. could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nMotorola Mobility’s reliance on marks owned by third-parties presents additional business risks.\n\nMotorola, Inc. has licensed, or has otherwise obtained the rights from third-parties to use, certain trademarks in connection with our products, including ANDROID™, DROID™ and CLIQ™. Such third-party ownership rights may be challenged by other third-parties. In the event that such third-party licensor is successfully challenged, our continued use of such trademarks could result in an injunction barring the sale of our products, and if such third-party licensor refuses or fails to indemnify the Company, we could be liable for payment of damages resulting from trademark infringement, thereby disrupting our continued and/or long-term use of such trademarks. We are aware that ANDROID is currently the subject of a trademark infringement lawsuit between Google and Android Data Corporation, and that the latter’s ANDROID DATA registration has initially been cited by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) against the owner of the pending application for DROID.\n\nThe occurrence or perception of a breach of our security or privacy policies, or inappropriate disclosure of end-user confidential or personal information could harm our business.\n\nMOTOBLUR™ , our service platform, handles the transmission of personally identifiable and other confidential information and data from end-users (“User Information”), and as such, provides the Company with access to such User Information. In addition, information stored in our smartphone products is subject to virus and security attacks related to the wireless transmission of data. In the event that the security measures implemented by us, our customers or our third-party service providers are breached, or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of User Information, including as a result of a security breach relating to either MOTOBLUR™ or our smartphones, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory action, which may result in significant liability or other sanctions. Even if we are not held liable, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of User Information could harm our reputation, and even the perception of security vulnerabilities or risks associated with our products could lead some customers to reduce or delay future purchases, or to purchase competing products or services. In addition, we may be required to invest additional resources to protect the Company against these actual or perceived disruptions or security breaches in the future.\n\nThe collection, storage, transmission, use and distribution of User Information and other personally identifiable information could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations or carrier and other customer requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\n\nWe collect, store and transmit large volumes of data, including User Information and other personally identifiable information, including employee and consumer information, in the course of supporting our internal\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\noperating systems and procedures as well as our MOTOBLUR service and smartphone products and related services. This information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. Governmental regulations are typically intended to protect the privacy and security of such User Information and other personally identifiable information as well as to regulate the collection, storage, transmission, transfer, use and distribution of such information.\n\nWe could be adversely affected if domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business. If we are required to allocate significant resources to modify our internal operating systems and procedures as well as our MOTOBLUR service or smartphones to enable enhanced security of User Information that we transmit and store, our business results could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, because various foreign jurisdictions have different laws and regulations concerning the storage and transmission of User Information and other personally identifiable information, we may face requirements that pose compliance challenges in new international markets that we seek to enter. Such variation could subject us to costs, liabilities or negative publicity that could impair our ability to expand our operations into some countries and therefore limit our future growth.\n\nOur wireless carrier or other customers may have differing expectations or impose particular requirements for the collection, storage, processing and transmittal of User Information and other personally identifiable information in connection with our MOTOBLUR service, or smartphone product and service offerings. Such expectations or requirements could subject us to costs, liabilities or negative publicity, and limit our future growth. If we are required to allocate significant resources to modify our MOTOBLUR service or smartphone product and service offerings to meet such requirements, we may incur additional costs to meet such requirements, and our time-to-market with various product and service offerings could be negatively affected.\n\nOur customers, suppliers, employees and facilities are located throughout the world and, as a result, we face risks that other non-global companies may not face.\n\nOur customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and in 2009 approximately 42% of our Mobile Devices business sales and 29% of our Home business sales were made to customers outside the U.S. In addition, we have many manufacturing, research and development, administrative and sales facilities outside the U.S. and more than half of our employees are employed outside the U.S. Most of our suppliers’ operations are outside the U.S. and all of our products (other than some prototypes) are manufactured outside the U.S.\n\nAs with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations outside the U.S., we are exposed to risks that could negatively impact sales or profitability, including but not limited to: (1) import/export regulations, tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes, customs classifications and certifications, including but not limited to changes in classifications or errors or omissions related to such classifications and certifications, (2) patent infringement actions in the ITC, (3) changes in U.S. and non-U.S. rules related to trade, the environment, health and safety, technical standards and consumer protection, (4) longer payment cycles, (5) tax issues, such as tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to country and as compared to the U.S., obligations under tax incentive agreements, and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner, (6) currency fluctuations, particularly in the Chinese renminbi, euro, Brazilian real, Taiwan dollar, and Korean won which could negatively impact our revenues and profits, (7) foreign exchange regulations, which may limit Motorola Mobility’s ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency, (8) challenges in collecting accounts receivable, (9) cultural and language differences, (10) employment regulations and local labor conditions, (11) difficulties protecting intellectual property in foreign countries, (12) instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including war and other hostilities, (13) natural disasters, (14) public health issues or outbreaks, (15) changes in laws or regulations that negatively impact benefits, such as tax benefits, being received by Motorola Mobility, (16) the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements, and (17) litigation in foreign judicial systems and foreign administrative proceedings.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also face additional challenges in emerging markets, including creating demand for our products and the negative impact of changes in the law or interpretation of the law in those countries.\n\nWe also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have polices and procedures to comply with these laws, our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business. Moreover, we face additional risks that our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services, because such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct.\n\nOur products are manufactured outside the U.S., primarily in China, Taiwan and Brazil, and our performance could be negatively impacted if manufacturing is disrupted or as a result of unique risks of doing business in these countries.\n\nOur products are manufactured outside the U.S. primarily in China, Taiwan and Brazil. If our manufacturing in these regions is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the legal systems in these countries are still developing and we face risks related to the negative impact of changes in the laws, or the interpretation of the laws, in these countries. In China and elsewhere, we face risks that our proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection under law as it is in countries with well-developed intellectual property laws similar to those in the U.S. Also in China, certain China-based competitors are acquiring very large portfolios of Chinese patents and may use those patents to interfere with our China-based manufacturing operations.\n\nIn Brazil, we face additional risks related to that country’s complex tax, labor, trade compliance and consumer protection laws and regulations. In Brazil, we manufacture and sell products and employ over 1,000 people. In connection with those activities we have had and continue to have legal disputes and controversies, including labor, trade compliance, tax controversies and legal cases that take many years to resolve. We incur legal and other costs in managing and defending these matters and expect to continue to incur such costs. Based on our assessment of these cases, we have recorded reserves on only a small portion of the total potential exposure, and/or in court cases, we have had to deposit cash in escrow accounts or provide surety bonds or letters of credit in some of the matters. It is, however, very difficult to predict the outcome of legal disputes and controversies, including litigation in Brazil, and our ultimate exposure may be significantly greater than our current assessments. Our operations in Brazil could be negatively impacted if we are deemed to be in violation of laws or regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines, taxes, judgments and litigation costs. We also face additional challenges in Brazil due to frequent changes in laws that may impact our operations and market strategy.\n\nIf the quality of our products does not meet our customers’ expectations or our products are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\n\nThe products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. Often these issues are identified prior to the shipment of the products and may cause delays in shipping products to customers, or even the cancellation of orders by customers. Sometimes, we discover quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to our customers, distributors or end-users, requiring us to resolve such issues in a manner that is the least disruptive to our customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment quality issues can have legal and financial ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future orders, customer imposed penalties for failure to meet our contractual requirements, penalties from regulatory agencies, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, a negative impact on our goodwill and brand name reputation, warranty claims and litigation, including class action litigation.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn some cases, if the quality issue affects the product’s safety or regulatory compliance, then such a “defective” product may need to be recalled or be subject to other actions in the field. Depending on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the field, it could cause us to incur substantial recall or field action costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential loss of future orders and the damage to our goodwill or brand reputation. In addition, we may be required, under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for failed performance that might exceed the revenue that we receive from the contracts. Recalls involving regulatory agencies could also result in fines and additional costs and trigger indemnification obligations. Finally, product defects could result in third-party litigation, including class action litigation by persons alleging common harm resulting from the purchase of the products.\n\nIf the volume of our sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs that could make our products less competitive, which could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nWe have negotiated favorable pricing terms with many of our suppliers, some of which have volume-based pricing. Under such pricing arrangements, we may experience higher than anticipated costs if current volume-based purchase projections are not met. Some contracts have minimum purchase commitments and we may incur financial liabilities or price increases if these commitments are not met. We also may have unused production capacity if our current volume projections are not met, increasing our production cost per unit. In the future, as we establish new pricing terms, our volume demand could negatively impact future pricing from suppliers. All of these outcomes may result in our products being more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive or could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nFailure to meet supply demands could negatively impact our relationship with customers and results of operations.\n\nA failure to meet the supply demands of our customers can lead customers to drop or otherwise restrict our products from promotions and key product placements. This could negatively impact our relationship with customers and our financial results.\n\nOur future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts and components to meet the demands of our customers and any reduction or interruption in supplies or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business.\n\nOur ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from our suppliers. Due to increased demand for products, many electronic manufacturers are experiencing shortages for certain components. In the second half of this year, if demand for our products increases from our current expectations, we could experience shortages. We have experienced shortages in the past driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business conditions of our suppliers that have negatively impacted our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter shortages in the future or that such shortages will not negatively impact our operations.\n\nFurthermore, certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources, such as certain specialized components for our smartphones and set-top boxes. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. A reduction or interruption in supplies or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our current contractual arrangements with certain suppliers may be cancelled, breached or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford the Company with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies.\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMany of our components and products are designed or manufactured by third-parties. If third-party manufacturers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third-party manufacturers, it could have a negative impact on our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products. If we are not able to engage such manufacturers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such third-parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third-parties, it could have a negative impact on our business. We also have third-party arrangements for the design or manufacture of certain products, parts and components, including batteries. If we are not able to engage such parties with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if these third-parties fail to deliver quality products, parts and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and that could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations.\n\nFailure of our suppliers, business partners and customers to use acceptable ethical business practices could negatively impact our business.\n\nIt is our policy to require our suppliers, business partners and customers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and our code of business conduct regarding working conditions, employment practices, environmental compliance and trademark and copyright licensing. However, we do not control their labor and other business practices. If one of our suppliers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. If one of our suppliers fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights or patents owned by third-parties, legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third-parties. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations.\n\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to form successful strategic alliances. If these arrangements do not develop as expected, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe currently form alliances with industry leaders to meet customer product and service requirements and to develop innovative advances in design and technology. Some of our alliances allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share the cost of developing next-generation technologies. Other alliances allow us to offer more services and features to our customers. If such arrangements do not develop as expected, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe rely on third-party distributors, representatives and retailers to sell certain of our products and our ability to bring products to market may be adversely affected by the loss or failure of one or more of our distributors.\n\nIn addition to our own sales force, we offer our products through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives and retailers. Certain of our distributors, representatives or retailers may also market other products that compete with our products. The loss or termination of one or more of our distributors, representatives or retailers, the failure of one or more of our distributors or representatives to effectively promote our products, or changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors or representatives could affect our ability to bring products to market.\n\nOur future financial results could be negatively impacted if we are not successful in licensing our intellectual property.\n\nAs part of our business strategy we generate revenue through the licensing of intellectual property rights. The licensed rights include those that are essential to telecommunications standards, such as the global system for mobile communications (“GSM”), third generation cellular (“3G”) and fourth generation cellular (“4G”) standards. Previously agreed-upon terms of some of our long-standing license agreements have reduced our royalty revenue over the past several years and may continue to reduce that revenue. As an independent legal\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nentity we may no longer receive certain licensing revenue that was allocated to us when we were part of Motorola, Inc. or if we do receive such revenue the accounting treatment of that revenue may be different than it was when we were part of Motorola, Inc. Uncertainty in the legal environment makes it difficult to assure that we will be able to enter into new license agreements that will be sufficient to offset that reduction in our revenue.\n\nCopyright levies in numerous countries for the sale of products could negatively impact our business.\n\nMotorola Mobility faces the possibility of substantial copyright levies from collecting societies in numerous countries for the sale of products that might be used for the private copying of copyright protected works such as mobile phones, memory cards and set-top boxes. The collecting societies argue that such levies should apply to such products because they include audio/video recording functionality, such as a Moving Picture Experts Group Format for Audio Layer 3 (“MP3”) player or a digital video recorder (“DVR”) or storage capability, despite the fact that such products are not primarily intended to act as a recording device. We are currently working with other major companies who are subject to copyright levies to challenge the applicability of these levies to our products, and are also engaged in aggressive efforts against the levies in general in the European Union. However, if levies are imposed upon our products, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\n\nIndustry consolidation in the telecommunications and cable industries could negatively impact our business because there would be fewer network operators and it could be more difficult to replace any lost customers.\n\nThe telecommunications and cable industries have experienced consolidation to gain efficiencies and economics of scale and this trend may continue. The convergence of video, voice and data service offerings may cause network operators to further consolidate across wireline, wireless and satellite delivery platforms. Consolidation by or among our customers could result in delays of purchases or in the selection of new suppliers by the merged companies, and negatively impact equipment suppliers, including our business. Due to continuing concentration within the cable industry worldwide, a small number of operators own a majority of cable TV systems and account for a significant portion of the capital spending made by cable telecommunication systems operators. Customer concentration has resulted in a smaller number of telecommunications customers making it more difficult to diversify our customer base.\n\nThe uncertainty of current economic and political conditions makes budgeting and forecasting difficult and could reduce demand for our products.\n\nCurrent conditions in the domestic and world economies remain very uncertain. The global financial crisis, U.S. unemployment levels and ongoing political conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties that have impacted worldwide markets. As a result, it is difficult to estimate changes in various parts of the world economy, including the markets in which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of demand for our products, the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures difficult.\n\nThe potential for future terrorist attacks, increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts and public health issues have created worldwide uncertainties that have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, demand for certain of our products.\n\nChanges in our operations or sales outside the U.S. markets could result in lost benefits in impacted countries and increase our cost of doing business.\n\nMotorola, Inc. has entered into agreements, and we may enter into new agreements from time to time, with non-U.S. governments, agencies or similar organizations under which we have received or may receive certain benefits relating to our operations and/or sales in the jurisdiction. If our circumstances change and operations or sales are not at levels originally anticipated, we could be at risk of losing some or all of these benefits and increasing our cost of doing business. In addition, certain of the benefits we enjoyed while part of Motorola, Inc. and its subsidiaries may no longer be available to us as an independent company.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may not generate sufficient future taxable income, which could require additional deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, or if there are significant changes in tax laws or in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and a negative impact on future operating results.\n\nThe outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities could impact our financial results.\n\nWe are subject to continued examination of the income tax returns filed by certain of our subsidiaries by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have a negative impact on future operating results.\n\nWe may be required to record additional goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in additional significant charges to earnings.\n\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry.\n\nWhile part of Motorola, Inc., our businesses have incurred goodwill impairments and asset impairments. The goodwill impairment charges resulted from lower asset values in the overall market and the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our near-term forecasts. The intangible asset impairments resulted from a change in a technology platform strategy. Further declines in our stock price or reductions in our future cash flow estimates and future operating results may require us to record significant additional goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges in our financial statements in future periods, which could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nWe may make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions would introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions.\n\nIn order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities, we may make strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits from acquisitions, (3) the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets, (4) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations, (6) the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience, (7) risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (8) difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, and (9) future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business.\n\nAcquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate may carry higher relative valuations (based on their earnings) than we do. This is particularly evident in software and services businesses. Acquiring a business that has a higher relative valuation than Motorola Mobility may be dilutive to our earnings, especially if the acquired business has little or no revenue. In addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly dilutive to near-term earnings and have, in the past, foregone certain of these acquisition opportunities.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nKey employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change in control payments, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity- based compensation rights. To retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we may offer additional retention incentives, but it could still be costly and difficult to retain certain key employees.\n\nIt may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of engineers and other highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive.\n\nCompetition for key technical personnel in high technology industries is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, assimilating, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. We may have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly skilled personnel during periods of poor operating performance.\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, retain and prepare succession plans for senior management and key employees.\n\nThe performance of our senior management and other key employees, in particular our chief executive officer, Dr. Jha, is critical to our success. If we are unable to retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key employees or attract them when needed, it could negatively impact Motorola Mobility. We rely on the experience of our senior management, who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and competition for management with experience in the technology industry is intense. A loss of the chief executive officer, a member of senior management or a key employee, particularly to a competitor, could also place us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our chief executive officer, senior management and other key employees, our business could be negatively impacted by their loss. The separation may also heighten risk related to the organizational structure of a newly independent company if certain subject matter experts or employees with specialized skills who may currently be shared with Motorola, Inc. will stay with Motorola, Inc. and have to be replaced at Motorola Mobility.\n\nThe unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation or administrative action could negatively impact Motorola Mobility.\n\nOur financial results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation, investigation or administrative actions, including those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws. There can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation. In addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation and these costs could negatively impact our financial results. See “Business—Legal Proceedings”.\n\nIt is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance we are forced to retain the risk.\n\nAs part of Motorola, Inc., we had many types of insurance coverage and also were self-insured for some risks and obligations. We may have more difficulty obtaining certain types of insurance or at sufficient levels of coverage or such insurance may be more costly as an independent company. The insurance market has been disrupted in the past after specific events such as September 11, 2001, the 2005 hurricanes and recent earthquakes and flooding. While the cost and availability of most insurance has stabilized, there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain at a cost effective level. Natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims and product liability are potential self-insured events that could negatively impact our financial results.\n\n25\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer protection, worker safety and environmental laws and failure to comply with these laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and negatively impact our financial performance.\n\nOur operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are subject to a wide range of global laws. We must comply with a variety of laws, standards and other requirements governing, among other things, health and safety, hazardous materials usage, packaging, consumer protection and environmental matters. Our products must obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy other regulatory concerns in the various jurisdictions where they are manufactured and/or sold. Many of our products must meet standards governing, among other things, interference with other electronic equipment and human exposure to radio frequency energy. Failure to comply with such requirements can subject us to liability, additional costs, reputational harm and, in severe cases, prevent us from selling our products in certain jurisdictions.\n\nCompliance with existing or future laws, regulations or government directives could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and negatively impact our financial performance. Some of these laws also relate to the use, disposal, clean up of, and exposure to hazardous substances. In the U.S., laws often require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault. Changes to U.S. or foreign environmental laws or our discovery of additional obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on Motorola Mobility.\n\nOver the last several years, laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories, recycling of both electronic products and packaging, reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products, and the transportation of batteries have expanded significantly. Laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products, standardization of connectors and power supplies, sound levels of music playing devices and other aspects of our products and business are also proliferating.\n\nThese laws impact our products and make it more expensive to manufacture and sell products. It may also be difficult to comply with the laws in a timely way. We may not have compliant products available in the quantities requested by our customers, thereby impacting our sales and profitability. We expect these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate increased demand for products meeting voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of certain hazardous substances from products, increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional accessibility.\n\nAllegations of health risks with using Motorola Mobility products, and the lawsuits and publicity relating to them, regardless of merit, could negatively impact our business, operating cash flows and financial condition.\n\nAssertions about health and safety, hazardous materials usage and other environmental concerns related to using Motorola Mobility products could adversely impact our business, operating cash flows and financial condition. Adverse factual developments or lawsuits against us, or even the perceived risk of adverse health effects from chemical or physical agents associated with the use of smartphones or other handheld devices could negatively impact sales, subject us to costly litigation and/or harm our reputation, business, operating cash flows and financial condition.\n\nThere has been public speculation about possible health risks to individuals from exposure to radio frequency energy from the use of mobile devices. Government agencies, international health organizations and other scientific bodies are currently conducting research into these issues. In addition, we have been named in individual plaintiff and class action lawsuits alleging that radio frequency emissions from mobile phones have caused or contributed to brain tumors, and that the use of mobile phones poses a health risk. There has been significant scientific research by various independent research bodies that has indicated that exposure to electromagnetic fields or to radio frequency energy, at levels within the limits prescribed by public health authority standards and recommendations, presents no known adverse effect to human health. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that other studies will not suggest or identify a link between electromagnetic fields or radio frequency energy and adverse health effects or that we will not be the subject of future lawsuits relating to this issue. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” for more details.\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGovernment regulation of radio frequencies may limit the growth of the wireless communications industry or reduce barriers to entry for new competitors.\n\nRadio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal communications industry may be affected: (1) by regulations relating to the access to allocated spectrum for wireless communication users, especially in urban areas, (2) if adequate frequencies are not allocated, or (3) if new technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use. Industry growth has been and may continue to be affected by the cost of new licenses required to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs.\n\nThe U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network systems, such as Wireless Fidelity (“WiFi”) and Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”). Other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of new technologies. Deregulation may introduce new opportunities for Motorola Mobility and our customers, but also new competition.\n\nChanges in government policies and laws related to the Internet could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nThe laws and regulations that impact access to, content on or commerce conducted on the Internet are still evolving. We could be negatively impacted by any such regulation in any country where we operate, including in the U.S. The adoption of such measures could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling such products.\n\nWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our operations, sales and operating results.\n\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within Motorola Mobility and some are outsourced. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems. These attempts, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm Motorola Mobility, our products or end-users, are sometimes successful. There also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly.\n\nWe have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but these measures may be insufficient and a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our operations and financial results. The theft and/or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could negatively impact our competitive position. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to the recent global financial crisis.\n\nThe global financial crisis that affected the banking system and financial markets which began during late 2008 and continued throughout 2009 and into 2010 resulted in a severe tightening in the worldwide credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit and equity markets. More recently, the destabilization of various currencies has also negatively impacted the global markets. This financial crisis has impacted, and could continue to impact, our business in a number of ways, including:\n\n27\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs a new company without long-term debt credit ratings, there can be no assurances that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\n\nFrom time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although based on the information available to us as of the date of this Information Statement we believe that the sources of capital in place at the time of the distribution will permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors currently and in the future, including: (1) our financial performance, (2) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, and (4) the state of the economy, including the telecommunications and cable industries. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\n\nWe do not expect to have long-term debt and, accordingly, do not expect to have rated debt. As a result, the following activities we conducted at Motorola, Inc., as a rated company, may be more difficult to perform:\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRisks Relating to the Separation\n\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, then we and/or Motorola, Inc. and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability.\n\nThe distribution is conditioned upon, among other things, Motorola, Inc.’s receipt of either a ruling by the IRS or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. Motorola, Inc. expects to receive an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz that the distribution will so qualify. Although the Motorola, Inc. Board of Directors may waive this condition, Motorola, Inc. has advised us that it does not intend to complete the distribution if it has not obtained such opinion. The opinion will rely on certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, and the opinion would not be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect. Notwithstanding the opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion relied is false or has been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the tax opinion. For more information regarding the tax opinion, see the section entitled “The Separation—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution” included elsewhere in this Information Statement.\n\n29\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, Motorola, Inc. would be subject to tax on gain, if any, as if it had sold the common stock of our Company in a taxable sale for its fair market value. In addition, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, each of our initial public stockholders would be treated as if the stockholder had received a distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to the stockholder, which generally would be taxed as a dividend to the extent of the stockholder’s pro rata share of Motorola, Inc.’s current and accumulated earnings and profits and then treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s basis in the Motorola, Inc. common stock and finally as capital gain from the sale or exchange of Motorola, Inc. common stock. Furthermore, even if the distribution were otherwise to qualify under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it may be taxable to Motorola, Inc. (but not to Motorola, Inc.’s stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code, if the distribution were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, stock representing a 50% or greater interest in Motorola, Inc. or us. For this purpose, any acquisitions of Motorola, Inc. stock or of our common stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Motorola, Inc. may be able to rebut that presumption. For a more detailed discussion, see the section entitled “The Separation—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Distribution” included elsewhere in this Information Statement.\n\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement among Motorola, Inc., Motorola Mobility, Inc. and us, we would generally be required to indemnify Motorola, Inc. against any tax resulting from the distribution to the extent that such tax resulted from any of the following events (among others): (1) an acquisition of all or a portion of our stock or assets, whether by merger or otherwise, (2) any negotiations, understandings, agreements or arrangements with respect to transactions or events that cause the distribution to be treated as part of a plan pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, stock representing a 50% or greater interest in Motorola Mobility, (3) certain other actions or failures to act by us, or (4) any breach by us of certain of our representations or undertakings. For a more detailed discussion, see the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Agreements With Motorola, Inc.—Tax Sharing Agreement” included elsewhere in this Information Statement. Our indemnification obligations to Motorola, Inc. and its subsidiaries, officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount. If we are required to indemnify Motorola, Inc. or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be subject to substantial liabilities.\n\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent, publicly traded company.\n\nBy separating from Motorola, Inc. there is a risk that our Company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have otherwise been were we still a part of the current Motorola, Inc. As part of Motorola, Inc., we were able to enjoy certain benefits from Motorola, Inc.’s operating diversity, purchasing and borrowing leverage, and available capital for investments. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent, publicly traded company.\n\nWe have no operating history as an independent, publicly traded company, and our historical and pro forma financial statements are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be reliable indicators of our future results.\n\nThe historical and pro forma financial statements included in this Information Statement do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of the following factors:\n\n30\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMotorola, Inc. will be using certain logos and other trademarks, trade names and service marks, including “MOTOROLA” and the Stylized M logo and all derivatives and formatives thereof such as MOTO (“Motorola Marks”), under license from Motorola Mobility following the distribution, which could result in product and market confusion and negatively impact our ability to expand our business under the Motorola brand.\n\nAlthough each of Motorola Mobility and Motorola, Inc. will be an independent company following the distribution, Motorola, Inc. will continue to use the Motorola Marks as part of its name, which Motorola, Inc. intends to change to Motorola Solutions, Inc., and in connection with many of its products. Motorola, Inc.’s use of the Motorola Marks is governed by an agreemen"
