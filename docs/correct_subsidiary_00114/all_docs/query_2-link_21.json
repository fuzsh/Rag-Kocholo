We are also dedicated to embracing and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts within our portfolio and the larger VC industry through efforts like the Diversity VC Standard.\n\nThe entrepreneurs who partner with us receive much more than money. Their success is our success, and we support them at every step of their journey â while giving them the freedom and flexibility they need to experiment and grow their businesses. We look for both financial returns and strategic value, and firmly believe that financial returns must precede strategic value.\n\nWe look for innovators who have the courage, humility, and tenacity to tackle important challenges we have yet to solve. Itâs the same spirit of innovation that inspired Toyota founder Kiichiro Toyoda and his team to devote themselves to transforming Toyota from a loom maker to an automotive manufacturer in the 1930âs. And it is this same vision that continues to drive Toyota today.\n\nIf you are the founder of an early-stage company developing solutions in areas we invest in and youâre looking for funding, you are invited to complete our online pitch form.
