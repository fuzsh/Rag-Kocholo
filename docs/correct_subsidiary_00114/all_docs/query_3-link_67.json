        "text": "We are proud of our special expertise in counseling senior executives, company founders and employee-stockholders on their rights in merger & acquisition (“M&A”) transactions and venture capital/private equity financings. This type of representation requires deep subject matter knowledge in the law of executive compensation (including tax, employment, corporate, securities and equity compensation rules) as well as decades of experience –on both sides of the table– in negotiating within the complex deal structures common to Silicon Valley. Because of our sophisticated practice in this area, we are frequently called upon by other lawyers to represent key individuals, as well as executive management groups, during M&A activity. The practice is led by partner Clayton Foster, whose thirty years of experience on both sides of the table makes her uniquely qualified to represent our executive and founder clients.\n\nExamples of representation in publicly announced M&A/financing transactions include:\n\nRepresentation of senior executive group for merger-related retention, employment and equity issues, including the following: $450M acquisition of Ticketfly by Pandora (NYSE:P); $5.4B acquisition of International Lease Financing Corp (ILFC) by AerCap (NYSE:AER); $100M acquisition of RiseSmart by Randstat Holding Company (AMS: RAND); acquisition of AtHoc by BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY); $85M acquisition of Speck Products by Samsonite International SA; $327M acquisition of Pliant Technology, Inc, by SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK); $500M acquisition of Actel Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTL) by Microsemi Corporation (NASDAQ:MSCC); $158M acquisition of Stratify, Inc. by Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM); $140M acquisition of Terayon Communications by Motorola, Inc.
