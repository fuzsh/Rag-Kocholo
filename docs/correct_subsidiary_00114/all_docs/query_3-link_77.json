I had the SB3100 (rental) for 2 years without a problem... speeds consistently at cap (3000/256).\n\nWhen I saw CM's getting under $150, decided to purchase one to save the $15/mo rental fee. My research told me that either the SB4100 or the Toshiba PCX1100 were good choices, so I went with the one that I could find at the best price, which ended up being the SB4100 ($105, vs. $125). My speeds are still consistently at cap. (Actually, average 3200 D/L per AnalogX NetStat Live).\n\nI've always had my CM's connected to a NIC, so I have no basis for comparison to USB. Everything I've read tells me that using a NIC is superior to USB. Since I've never tried USB for myself, I'll just have to take their word for it.\n\nblueberry2\n\njoin:2002-01-08\n\nPhoenix, AZ\n\nblueberry2 to DirtyDog\n\nMember\n\nto DirtyDog\n\nThe major differences between Motorola SB4100 and Toshiba PCX1100U.\n\n----------------Motorola------------Toshiba--------\n\nLAN side: 10/100 Mbps autosense 10 Mbps\n\nfull duplex half duplex\n\n# of users\n\nsupported: 32 16\n\nI vote for the Motorola SB4100.

You'll NEVER NEVER NEVER get 10Mbps on a half duplex line because of the collisions that start at 2-3 Mbps and gets more frequent as you go up to 10Mbps.\n\nThat doesn't sound right to me. The router is going to receive each packet at 10 Mbps, then transmit it on the LAN at 100 Mbps. The loading on the LAN will be the same regardless of the WAN interface being at 10 or 100 Mbps.\n\nAnd, routers such as the Netgear RT314 have a full-fledged 10/100 full-duplex switch, so the traffic going to and from the WAN will not cause collisions with LAN traffic.\n\nThreeD\n\nPremium Member\n\njoin:2001-05-19\n\nSouthern Cal\n\nThreeD to Bobcat79\n\nPremium Member\n\nto Bobcat79\n\nIs there any difference between the Toshiba 1100 and 1100U -other than the 1100U has a USB port in addition to the Ethernet connection?\n\nblueberry2\n\njoin:2002-01-08\n\nPhoenix, AZ\n\nblueberry2 to Bobcat79\n\nMember\n\nto Bobcat79\n\nIf this your setup\n\nInternet Toshiba Netgear router\n\n-- (LAN: half duplex) ------- (WAN: full duplex)\n\n10 Mbps 10/100 Mbps auto\n\nThen you'll still have a 10Mbps half duplex line between the Toshiba and the router.\n\nI doubt you can get 7.5 Mbps like the Terajet mentioneed above on that 10 Mbps half duplex connection.
