        "text": "Major companies regularly turn to us to defend and prosecute class actions throughout the United States. Our partners have defended more than 1000 of them.\n\nNo hold-ups: According to The Lawyer 2017, Quinn Emanuel is the country’s top business trial firm which significantly contributes to our outstanding results in class actions. Our lawyers have the respect of courts and opposing counsel, and our willingness to try even the most difficult case tells opposing counsel litigating against us will not be business as usual. Among other benefits, this means the plaintiffs’ bar knows it cannot rely on the inevitable strike-suit settlement.\n\nExperienced lawyers: Our class action bench is deep. More than half our partners regularly represent clients in class actions. We have extensive knowledge of the procedural and litigation dynamics unique to class actions, as well as expertise in the underlying substantive areas of the law. We also have established productive working relationships with the plaintiffs’ class action bar, which pay dividends in terms of limiting discovery and other litigation disputes, as well as at the settlement table.\n\nWe have represented clients in class actions in virtually every discipline and dozens of jurisdictions. Our expertise includes:\n\nAntitrust\n\nConsumer Fraud\n\nData Privacy & Security\n\nFalse Advertising\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nProduct Liability\n\nRICO Claims\n\nSecurities Fraud\n\nToxic Tort\n\nUnfair Competition\n\nWage-and-Hour Claims\n\nOur class action experience spans almost every major industry, including high-tech electronics, banking and financial services, oil and gas, entertainment, telecommunications, medical services, defense contracting, insurance, toy and game manufacturing, and sharing economy companies. Our lawyers have litigated class actions involving everything from computer hardware to Formula One racing, home-equity loans to bullet-proof vests, and credit cards to fuel economy.\n\nExit strategies: We know a class action can quickly become a tool for litigation extortion. Effective defense requires early identification of our client’s optimal exit strategy. We are particularly proud of our track record resolving class actions at modest expense to our clients—whether through an outright win or a sensible business-savvy settlement. In several instances, we have persuaded plaintiffs’ counsel to drop cases altogether after providing informal discovery. We have resolved other cases on very favorable terms through mediation before any discovery or certification proceedings. And we have a strong track record getting cases dismissed on early motions.\n\nWe also represent plaintiffs: We are equally effective prosecuting class actions. We have achieved excellent results—including ten-figure recoveries—on behalf of plaintiffs alleging a variety of state and federal class claims including antitrust violations, RICO, and unfair business practices. Because we work both sides of the class action aisle, we thoroughly understand the strategic decisions that inform winning strategies.\n\nThe significance, size, complexity, diversity, and number of our class action representations led Law360 to select Quinn Emanuel as a “Class Action Practice Group of the Year” in 2015, one of only five selected from among nearly 550 nominations, and again in 2021. We describe below class actions we defended or prosecuted."
