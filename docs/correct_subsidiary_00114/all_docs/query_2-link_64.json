        "text": "Introduction\n\nEvery year, class action settlements bring $10–$20 billion into federal courts. And every year, federal judges award billions of these dollars to plaintiffs’ attorneys in payment of fees and reimbursement of expenses. The payments are essential. But for these awards, the incentive to wage class actions—which entail enormous commitments of time and financial resources —would disappear. One can say, without exaggeration, that federal judges enable millions of people to obtain access to justice each year by rewarding lawyers for litigating class actions successfully.\n\nYet the process by which judges set fee and cost awards remains a black box. Settlements go in; awards come out. Little is known about the mechanism that earmarks dollars for attorneys. Consequently, it is difficult to know why fee awards are sized as they are. Studies have shown that more dollars flow to lawyers when settlements are larger; that, in percentage terms, awards tend to decline as recoveries rise; and that investors get more “bang for the buck” in securities-fraud class actions when public pension funds serve as lead plaintiffs. But the causes of these phenomena remain hidden from view because researchers have not peered inside the fee-setting mechanism.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: It takes work—a lot of it—to study fee-setting processes in action. In securities-fraud cases, which account for about 40% of all federal class actions and for over 70% of all federal class action recoveries, the mechanism first cranks up when the court appoints the lead plaintiff and lead counsel at the start of litigation. To study just this part of the process, one must review the motions, memoranda, and declarations filed by the parties and lawyers seeking control of the case, along with the orders entered by the court. With seventy to eighty settlements per year and two or more parties per case seeking appointment as the lead plaintiff, it takes substantial effort just to determine which parties and lawyers sought control, who won, and whether judges considered compensation terms when selecting the winners. To make matters more challenging, the relevant documents must often be obtained directly from courts because they are not available electronically. The process must then be repeated for each case at the settlement stage, where the items to be collected and reviewed include motions for settlement approval and fee awards, supporting affidavits, objections, responses to objections, and the court’s various orders.\n\nDo the stakes justify the effort needed to peer inside the black box? Yes. More than billions of dollars in compensation and access to justice for millions of people are at issue. The law’s ability to influence conduct outside the courthouse also hangs in the balance. By setting fees too high or too low, judges would incentivize lawyers to bring too many class actions or too few. Excessive litigation would over-deter primary conduct that is desirable; insufficient litigation would under-deter primary conduct that is unwanted. These consequences will occur wherever we rely on private enforcement through class litigation: antitrust, civil rights, consumer protection, and a host of other areas, including financial fraud. The deep reason for opening the black box is to learn whether the procedural system operates in ways that are reasonably thought to advance the goals of substantive laws.\n\nThe need is especially acute in the securities area, both because securities-fraud cases comprise a large percentage of the federal class action docket and because Congress instructed judges legislatively how to handle fee awards in these cases. In 1995, Congress adopted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) because it viewed the securities class action system as dysfunctional and abusive. One concern for Congress was that the litigants who served as representative plaintiffs were often small investors who would not or could not monitor class counsel effectively. They were figureheads for lawyers who financed the cases, ran them as they wished, and, for all important purposes, were the real parties in interest.\n\nAnother concern was that the traditional solution to this agency cost problem—ex post monitoring by federal judges—had proven inadequate. Although charged by the rules to act as guardians for absent class members, judges were at least as interested in getting cases off their dockets as they were in rooting out abuses. Judges lacked the means to police abuses too. They could not rely on the parties who proposed settlements to bring problems to their attention, and they could not (always) rely on objectors to do so either. Objectors only appeared in some cases, and their agendas were often suspect. Many objectors were hold-up artists bent on extorting payments.\n\nBy enacting the PSLRA, Congress gave class-action procedure a substantial overhaul. Seeking to rely less on judges and objectors and more on incentives, it sought to put class actions under the control of sophisticated investors with large financial stakes. The hope was that these investors would seek to maximize their own net recoveries by maximizing the net recoveries for everyone. They would use contingent-fee arrangements to incentivize excellent attorneys to obtain good results, while using competition among lawyers to obtain bargain rates. Sophisticated investors would also evaluate settlements, reducing the burden on judges, who are poorly placed to figure out whether proposed deals are good or bad.\n\nEmpirical studies of inputs and outputs suggest that the PSLRA has been a reasonable success. Although many of the most sophisticated private investment funds still refuse to serve as lead plaintiffs, public pension funds have volunteered in numbers, and their use of the mechanisms created by the PSLRA appears to be reducing agency costs. Cases led by public pension funds tend to have higher recoveries and lower attorneys’ fees than other securities class actions, controlling for important case characteristics. Even in cases led by other kinds of plaintiffs, attorneys’ fees have declined significantly over time.\n\nWithout looking inside the black box, however, it is impossible to know whether the credit for these successes belongs to the PSLRA or to other aspects of the fee-setting mechanism. The documented reduction in attorneys’ fees and other agency costs could be the result of hard bargaining between institutional lead plaintiffs and class counsel. But the credit could, at least in part, also belong to federal judges, who may use the fees awarded in cases with public pension lead plaintiffs as the model for fees in other cases. The fact that fees have fallen in securities class actions of all types since the enactment of the PSLRA, including those led by other investors, suggests that judges are playing an important role.\n\nTo learn how fee awards in class actions are set and whether the PSLRA is working as Congress intended, we created an original database with information on all of the 431 securities class action settlements that were announced between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012 in the federal district courts in the United States. This database is uniquely rich because it contains details gathered from the actual court filings in each of the cases, in addition to the settlement amounts and fee awards on which other studies rely. The data include the number and type of plaintiffs who sought control of class litigation, the terms of any agree­ments regarding fees and costs that were disclosed to the courts, the amounts requested as fees, the formulas for calculating fees that judges were asked to employ, the presence and number of objectors, and many other details. This information enables a deeper look inside the fee-setting black box.\n\nThis granular approach to analyzing the fee-setting process yields a picture that is far more nuanced than—and significantly different from—that suggested by the conventional wisdom, which is that institutional investors are solely responsible for recent improvements in the operation of securities class actions. Many of this study’s findings show that the PSLRA has not worked as hoped. For example, although the statute was supposed to encourage lead plaintiffs to bargain over fees with class counsel at the start of litigation, we find that cases with ex ante fee agreements are the exception rather than the rule. And although courts are making smaller fee awards, in the vast bulk of cases that does not appear to be because they are explicitly choosing to abide by fee agreements negotiated between lead plaintiffs and their chosen counsel. The truth appears to be that, instead of enforcing (and requiring) such ex ante fee agreements, the courts in most cases set fees in precisely the same manner they did before passage of the PSLRA—ex post, after a settlement has already been reached.\n\nEqually troubling is the finding that the market for attorneys’ fees may be even more imperfect than previously suspected. Data reveal that the market for attorneys’ fees is geographically segmented. Judges from high-volume districts (those that see securities class actions more frequently) set fees that are significantly different from those set by judges from low-volume districts. The data also suggest that plaintiffs’ attorneys may be aware of and may seek to exploit these market imperfections by asking courts for significantly higher fees in low-volume districts than in high-volume ones.\n\nPerhaps most contrary to the goals of the PSLRA are our findings regarding courts’ current handling of fee requests in the minority of cases (about 15%) in which courts cut the requested fee. Regression analyses show that these judicial fee cuts are effectively random events, driven more by judges’ predilections and biases than by the merits of the fee requests. The unpredictability of fee cuts necessarily creates uncertainty on the part of class counsel, who cannot reliably estimate the returns on effort. This likely discourages lawyers from investing time and resources optimally in class action cases, to the detriment of investors who will lose compensation in particular cases and be victimized by frauds too often. Fee-related uncertainty weakens the law’s power to discourage wrongdoing.\n\nTaken as a whole, these findings suggest that the current system of ex post fee-setting in securities class actions is deeply flawed. This Article therefore proposes a mechanism that would both work better and be more consonant with Congress’s intent, as expressed in the PSLRA. The cornerstone for this proposal is the belief that attorneys’ fees in securities class actions should be set ex ante. The lead plaintiff should negotiate a fee when retaining counsel to handle the case. The lead plaintiff should be required to disclose the terms of the negotiated fee agreement to the district court when offering a law firm for appointment as class counsel. The district court should review the negotiated fee terms before appointing class counsel and should approve those terms unless they are clearly unreasonable or not the products of arm’s-length negotiations. And when reviewing class counsel’s request for a fee award at the end of litigation, the district court should apply the agreed and previously approved terms unless unforeseen developments have rendered those terms clearly excessive or unfair. Among the advantages of this Article’s proposal are that it respects the PSLRA’s preference for private ordering, and it creates superior incentives for attorneys to invest the optimal amount of time and resources in the litigation, thereby maximizing the recovery to the class.\n\nThe Article begins in Part I by briefly discussing the lead plaintiff and lead counsel selection mechanisms contained in the PSLRA. Part II sets out the design of the six-year nationwide study and discusses the empirical findings in greater depth. Part III discusses the normative implications that flow from these findings. It also considers several procedural reforms that would make fee-setting in securities class actions more transparent and compatible with the PSLRA by enhancing the flow of information to judges.\n\nI. The PSLRA’s Mechanisms for Selecting the Lead Plaintiff and Class Counsel and for Setting Attorneys’ Fees\n\nUnder the PSLRA, the court chooses the lead plaintiff through a straightforward procedure. The party that is first to file a securities class action provides notice of the lawsuit to all investors by publication in a “widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire service.” Interested investors then have sixty days to file a motion nominating themselves for the position of lead plaintiff. Upon review of the timely submitted applications, the court is to appoint the “most adequate plaintiff” as the lead plaintiff. The PSLRA imposes on the court a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff is the applicant that has “the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class” and that “otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” The PSLRA further specifies that the lead plaintiff is obligated, “subject to the approval of the court, [to] select and retain counsel to represent the class.”\n\nIn practice, when an investor files its application to be appointed lead plaintiff it typically has already chosen the law firm that it will recommend that the court appoint as class counsel. Indeed, that chosen law firm usually serves as counsel-of-record for the investor in the process of applying for lead plaintiff status and in requesting that the investor’s chosen counsel be appointed counsel for the class.\n\nThe PSLRA’s mandate that the lead plaintiff “select and retain” counsel to represent the class suggests that a lead plaintiff candidate will hire its chosen law firm, including negotiating the terms of its compensation (subject to judicial review). Professors Elliott Weiss and John Beckerman, who conceived of the lead plaintiff mechanism, hoped and expected that institutional investors would apply to be appointed lead plaintiffs and, when given control of class actions, “would act as reasonably diligent litigation monitors, negotiating arm’s length fee arrangements with plaintiffs’ attorneys and overseeing the prosecution and settlement of the actions in which they were involved.” In other words, unlike passive small investors, institutional investors were supposed to be active participants in the litigation. They were expected to drive hard bargains with lawyers competing for the opportunity to earn fees by representing investor classes and to demand zealous representation from the lawyers they retained.\n\nConsistent with the above analysis, the Third Circuit requires district court judges to consider fee agreements when appointing lead plaintiffs. The trial judge’s job, according to the Third Circuit, is to ensure that the lead plaintiff “fairly and adequately represent[s] the interest of the class.” And “one of the best ways” a trial judge can do this is by “inquir[ing] whether [a lead plaintiff candidate] has demon­strated a willingness and ability to select competent class counsel and to negotiate a reasonable retainer agreement with that counsel.”\n\nThe reported cases, however, suggest that this ex ante approach is infrequently employed. Judges outside the Third Circuit rarely examine fee agreements when appointing lead plaintiffs, and even within the Third Circuit, many district courts do not seem to do so. Prior to this Article’s study, however, there was no systematic, comprehensive information about the extent to which district courts’ existing practices comport with Congress’s intent in enacting the PSLRA. In brief, no systematic information was available about the frequency with which lead plaintiffs negotiate ex ante fee agreements with class counsel; the frequency with which courts consider such agreements when appointing lead plaintiffs; the frequency with which class counsel invokes an ex ante fee agreement when seeking an award of fees from the court at the end of the litigation; or the frequency with which the court invokes (and enforces the terms of) class counsel’s ex ante fee agreement with the lead plaintiff when awarding attorneys’ fees at the end of the litigation. Nor was systematic information available about how often or to what extent judges overrule lead plaintiffs when awarding fees. Finally, it was not known whether, on average, judges or institutional investors with large financial stakes tended to be more parsimonious with regard to attorneys’ fees or whether there are systemic differences across courts with respect to fee awards.\n\nBefore turning to the details of this Article’s study, it is worth pausing briefly to describe how fees are typically set in class actions. When submitting a proposed settlement for judicial review, class counsel also submits an application for an award to cover attorneys’ fees and litigation costs. More often than not, class counsel requests a percentage of the common fund as fees, and judges calculate fees on this basis. When setting the fee percentage or determining fees on another basis, judges enjoy broad discretion. The PSLRA and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h) specify only that fee awards be “reasonable.”\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, plaintiffs’ law firms, in order to establish the reasonableness of their fee request, provide information on the number of hours their attorneys worked on the case multiplied by the hourly rates common for attorneys in that district. Indeed, some courts mandate that attorneys provide detailed information on this figure—known as the “lodestar.” Lodestar amounts are usually below the fee requested. The multiplier applied to adjust the lodestar amount to the percentage requested is supposed to compensate attorneys for the risks associated with handling the case on a contingency basis. In cases where the multiplier is unusually high (or, theoretically, unusually low), the court has the ability to adjust the percentage award. The literature on the lodestar methodology is vast, and although it has been subject to withering judicial and academic criticism, the approach is still commonly used by courts (and therefore also by class counsel in their fee requests ) as a “cross-check” on the reasonableness of the percent­age fee requested.\n\nIn most cases, this process occurs in a largely non-adversarial setting. Defendants are typically indifferent to fee awards because in a common fund case, the fee is deducted from the settlement and therefore simply involves the allocation of an already fixed sum between class counsel and class members. A larger fee costs a defendant no more and a smaller fee saves a defendant no money. The primary challenges to excessive fees are supposed to come from class members, but prior studies show that objections to fee requests are rare.\n\nII. The Data on Fee-Setting in Securities Class Actions\n\nThis Part contains the study’s analyses of fee-setting in securities class actions. Section A provides information on how we created the study’s sample. Section B reports the empirical findings.\n\nA. The Sample\n\nUsing lists of case names and docket numbers provided by the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse, which supplied a comprehensive list of securities class actions filed in federal court since passage of the PSLRA, we identified every securities class action filed in every federal district court in which the parties announced a settlement from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2012. Hand-collected, comprehensive data for each of these 431 cases was then obtained by examining the following documents in the court record for each case: (1) all motions for appointment of lead plaintiff and lead counsel, along with all supporting memoranda, affidavits, declarations, and other documents; (2) court orders appointing lead plaintiffs and approving lead counsel; (3) all motions and supporting memoranda, affidavits, declarations, and other documents requesting an award of attorneys’ fees; (4) any filed objections to the settlement, including objections to the proposed attorneys’ fees; (5) any filed responses to the objections, and any related court orders; (6) court orders granting final approval to the settlement; and (7) court orders awarding attorneys’ fees.\n\nIn these documents for each case, we looked for evidence that the lead plaintiff candidates had negotiated fee agreements with their chosen counsel at the outset of the litigation. We also examined whether judges considered the existence or terms of an ex ante fee agreement when appointing the lead plaintiff, approving a lead plaintiff’s proposed class counsel, or awarding fees to class counsel at the end of the litigation. We then coded the characteristics of the parties that were ultimately chosen as lead plaintiffs. Finally, we looked at the arguments lawyers offered to justify their fee requests, the bases for any objections to the fee request, and the explanations judges gave for their decisions.\n\nB. Empirical Findings\n\nSection II.B presents this Article’s empirical findings below in two parts. Section II.B.1 first sets out various descriptive statistics summa­rizing the examination of the actual court filings in all of the 431 cases in the six-year data set. Section II.B.2 then presents and discusses a series of regression analyses aimed at providing a better understanding of how ex ante fee agreements, the participation of public pension funds, and judicial experience with securities class actions are correlated with fee requests and awards.\n\n1. Descriptive Statistics. — This Article’s nationwide data set contains a wealth of new information about the operation “on the ground” of the fee-award process in securities class actions. Section II.B.1 summarizes and discusses that information below (and in Tables 1 and 2) with a focus on three areas: the lead plaintiff selection process, fee requests and awards, and judicial fee reductions.\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics (Continuous Variables)\n\nObs.

The Lead Plaintiff Selection Process. — The study’s analysis began by looking for cases in which proposed lead plaintiffs offered the court proof of the ex ante fee agreements they had negotiated. Although Congress and the drafters of the lead plaintiff mechanism seemed to anticipate that such agreements would be the norm, there is little evidence that they play a significant role in a court’s selection of the lead plaintiff. There were very few cases—just 11.29% —in which the lead plaintiff candidate or the court discussed an ex ante agreement during the appointment process. The study then looked at whether lawyers vary their approach to obtaining the lead plaintiff position for their clients, such as by referencing an ex ante fee agreement in the motion to be appointed lead plaintiff, depending on the frequency with which courts handle securities class actions. The study analyzes that question in several ways. First, the sample was segmented using an indicator variable (High Volume) with a value of 1 for cases litigated in one of the three districts with the largest number of securities class actions—the Central and Northern Districts of California, and the Southern District of New York—and a value of 0 otherwise. Overall, lead plaintiff candidates discuss ex ante fee negotiations in 11.29% of cases—13.59% of the cases litigated in high-volume districts and 9.13% in other districts. Although this difference suggests the possibility that counsel for lead plaintiff candidates use court-specific strategies in the lead plaintiff application process, the difference is not statistically significant.\n\nNext, the study looks at judges’ experience with securities class actions. Because the study comprises data on all settlements during the six-year study period, the frequency with which any individual judge appears in the sample provides a rough measure of judicial experience with these cases. The sample contains 246 individual judges; 160 of those judges contributed a single fee decision, but the number of decisions per judge ranges from 1 to 8. On average, each judge contri­buted 2.81 decisions to the data set, with a standard deviation of 1.98. Based on these data, we created a variable (High Volume Judge) that takes a value of 1 if a judge had four or more fee decisions in our sample and 0 otherwise. Discussion of fee arrangements in the lead plaintiff applica­tion process is significantly more frequent in cases handled by high-volume judges (16.42%) than in cases handled by other judges (8.93%), suggesting that lawyers may modify their strategy for obtaining lead counsel positions depending on the judge who hears the case. That is, lawyers may be more willing to discuss, or at least mention, fee arrange­ments in their filings when a high-volume judge is handling the case, presumably because they expect that information to strengthen the case for appointment of the lead plaintiff candidate that they represent (and therefore also their own appointment as lead counsel).\n\nThe study also analyzed the relationship between competition for the lead plaintiff position and the frequency with which lead plaintiff candidates discuss ex ante fee agreements. Overall, there is a good deal of competition to capture the lead plaintiff position. Overall, 71% of the cases had more than one motion to be appointed lead plaintiff, with a mean (median) of 3.22 (3) motions per case. One case had seventeen different applications for appointment as lead plaintiff. Not surprisingly, the cases with competition turn out to yield significantly larger settlements, suggesting that prospective lead counsel may have the ability to identify the more lucrative or otherwise higher quality cases at the earliest stages of the litigation. Cases with multiple lead plaintiff motions had mean (median) settlements of $65.0 million ($12.0 million), compared to only $21.2 million ($7.5 million) for the cases with only one motion. Competition for the lead plaintiff position is also correlated with a higher frequency of discussion of an ex ante fee agreement in the lead plaintiff moving papers. Where there was no competition, fee arrangements were discussed in only 4.00% of the cases, compared to 14.33% of the cases with competition. The study found no evidence that competition for the role of lead plaintiff is more frequent in high-volume districts.\n\nWhile evidence of ex ante fee agreements in the moving papers was sparse, there was even less evidence that judges actually considered ex ante fee agreements when awarding the lead counsel position. In only 4.88% of the cases did the court’s order appointing the lead plaintiff and class counsel make any mention of such an agreement. There were no significant differences between high- and low-volume districts, but high-volume judges were twice as likely (7.35% to 3.74%) as other judges to mention ex ante agreements in their selection decisions. Judges are much more likely to focus on fee arrangements when the lawyers have raised them, but discussion in the moving papers is by no means a guarantee that courts will address fees when appointing the lead plaintiff. Just 25% of the orders appointing the lead plaintiff mentioned fee arrangements in cases where fees were discussed in the lead plaintiff motion papers, compared to only 2.39% of fee orders in the remaining sample. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, courts seemingly did not consider the presence of a negotiated fee arrangement to be pertinent to the lead plaintiff and lead counsel appointment decisions. We speculate that this result may be the product of the PSLRA, which explicitly makes the size of the lead plaintiff’s stake in the case the overwhelming consideration for the court when appointing the lead plaintiff.\n\nWhile the courts discussed such ex ante fee agreements in only a few cases, those that did emphasized that the presence of such an agreement is relevant, either with respect to whether the lead plaintiff satisfies the adequacy prong of Rule 23 or to whether the court should approve lead plaintiff’s proposed lead counsel. For example, the judge in Taubenfeld v. Career Education Corp. appointed the candidate with the largest financial interest as lead plaintiff, but noted that the plaintiff’s moving papers did not discuss its chosen counsel’s proposed fee structure. As this was “significant information the court would like to review prior to making a determination on lead counsel,” the court reserved its decision appointing lead counsel until the law firm submitted the requested fee information. Unfortunately, there are too few instances of this kind of judicial demand for additional information in the data set to determine whether they are correlated with lower fee requests or awards. The simple fact is that most courts, perhaps because of time or other constraints, appear to be indifferent to such evidence when they make their lead plaintiff selections.\n\nb. Fee Requests and Awards. — The data show that ex ante fee agree­ments are more frequently invoked when the lead counsel applies for a fee award than when they seek appointment as lead counsel. Overall, in 18.10% of the cases, lead counsel argued that the presence of a nego­tiated ex ante agreement with the lead plaintiff justified its requested fee. Although this argument was more frequent in high- versus low-volume districts (19.14% versus 17.12%), the difference was not statisti­cally significant. Lead counsel was significantly more likely to make this argument in front of a high-volume judge (23.53%) than a low-volume judge (15.59%). Consistent with the view that sophisticated institutional investors make the best monitors of class counsel, evidence in the record of an ex ante fee agreement is most prevalent when a public pension fund is the lead plaintiff. Evidence of such an agreement was present in 27.70% of the cases with public pension lead plaintiffs compared to just 13.07% of cases with other lead plaintiff types. This difference was significant.\n\nSomewhat more frequently (34.65% of the cases), attorneys noted in their fee-request filings that the lead plaintiff supported the requested fee, often without any discussion of whether that support was premised on an ex ante fee agreement. In many cases, the lead plaintiff’s support came solely as a result of an ex post evaluation of the fairness of the fee. In such a case, the lead plaintiff or its representative would typically file a supporting declaration indicating that it thought the requested fee was fair based on the work performed and the result achieved. It is possible that the variables in our regressions (discussed below) for ex ante fee agreements and public pension plaintiffs might not be measuring separate effects. Plaintiffs’ attorneys said in informal interviews that, in their experience, some form of ex ante fee agreement is present in virtually all cases with public pension funds. For that reason, we have speculated that these variables may be “measuring some variation of the same thing—the impact that a sophisticated and engaged lead plaintiff has on fee requests.”\n\nSome evidence from this Article’s current, nationwide study, however, is at odds with that anecdotal evidence. In cases with both public pension lead plaintiffs and evidence of an ex ante fee agreement, the average fee request is 13.31%. By contrast, in cases with a public pension lead plaintiff but no evidence of an ex ante fee agreement, requests are significantly higher, averaging 22.42%. These data suggest that fee agreements negotiated at the beginning of cases have a substantial moderating effect on fee requests, even when cases are under the control of sophisticated institutional investors. To put the matter another way, public pension funds may come in two types—those that act aggressively to reduce agency costs and those that do not—and the presence of an ex ante fee agreement may help distinguish one from the other. Relatedly, the absence of an ex ante agreement may also correlate with instances of pay-to-play, a practice known to weaken the enthusiasm of public pension funds for bargaining hard with attorneys over fees.\n\nOverall, the mean (median) fee request in the sample of cases is 24.60% (25.00%). In cases without ex ante agreements, overall fee requests are 26.07%, compared to 17.93% in cases with evidence of ex ante agreements. These differences are significant. The same pattern exists with respect to fee awards. In cases without an ex ante agreement, fee awards averaged 25.12%, compared to 17.62% in cases with evidence of an ex ante agreement. Of course, these simple comparisons cannot tell us whether it is the presence of an ex ante fee agreement that is driving this result. Inflation-adjusted settlements, for example, are significantly larger in the cases with ex ante agreements ($136 million) than in the cases without such agreements ($33.8 million). Fee requests and awards measured as a percentage of settlement tend to decline as settlement size increases, so it is possible that the difference in the size of the settlements explains the difference in fees.\n\nTo get a better sense of how settlement size and the presence of an ex ante fee agreement might be correlated with fee requests and awards, Figure 1 depicts fee requests and awards as a percentage of the settle­ment. Figure 1 shows that the majority of fee requests are clustered into one of three values—25%, 30%, or 33.33%. A 25% fee request is the mode for the sample (occurring in 26.22% of the cases), an unsurprising result given the number of courts, particularly in the Ninth Circuit, that explicitly use 25% as a benchmark for awarding fees. The vast majority (74.36%) of fee requests in cases with ex ante agreements, however, are below 25%. The slopes for the predicted values in cases with and without agreements are close to parallel, which suggests that the effect of an ex ante fee agreement does not vary with the settlement size.\n\nFigure 1: Fee Requests and Awards in Cases with and without Ex Ante Agreements\n\nThere is substantial evidence that the court’s familiarity with securities class actions makes a difference not only with respect to fee awards, but also with respect to fee requests. Experience, in other words, matters both in terms of what lawyers ask for and what courts give them. These differences become particularly pronounced if one looks jointly at both judicial experience and settlement size. As settlement size increases, lawyers ask for and are awarded significantly larger fees in those districts that see fewer securities class actions. Fee requests averaged 26.30% in the low-volume districts compared to just 22.79% in the high-volume districts. Overall, fee awards were significantly higher (25.73%) in the low-volume districts than in the high-volume ones (21.67%). In the top quartile of settlements in our nationwide study, average fee requests in the low-volume districts were 23.10% compared to 18.50% in the high-volume districts. Fee awards for those cases average 22.41% in the low-volume districts versus 17.46% in the high-volume districts. These differences are also significant.\n\nFigure 2 provides a starker illustration of how fee-request practices vary between high- and low-volume districts. To understand the signifi­cance of these results, it is important to emphasize that one of the most robust findings of existing empirical research is that awards of attorneys’ fees exhibit scale effects—as settlement size increases, fee percentages decline. Until now, most commentators simply assumed that these scale effects were uniform across districts and judges. But as Figure 2 illustrates, that is simply not the case. Fee requests and awards are again shown as a percentage of the settlement. In low-volume districts, Figure 2 shows that, on average, fee requests are less sensitive to settlement size, with requests declining only slightly as settlements increase. There are, to be sure, some low fee requests (defined as requests below 20%) in the low-volume districts, but those cases overwhelmingly have either a public pension lead plaintiff (71.22% of the cases) or evidence of an ex ante fee agreement (53.57% of the cases). In low-volume districts, there were 132 cases that had neither a public pension lead plaintiff nor evidence of an ex ante fee agreement. Only five of those cases (3.79%) had fee requests below 20%.\n\nFigure 2: Fee Requests and Awards in Cases in Low and High Volume Districts\n\nBy contrast, in high-volume districts, the downward slope of the fitted values line is steeper. In these districts, lawyers ask for substantially lower percentage fees as settlement size increases than in the low-volume districts. Again, however, these simple comparisons of means cannot tell one whether this effect is really associated with the volume of securities cases settled in the high-volume districts or is instead the result of the kinds of securities cases that are brought in those districts. For example, it remains possible that sophisticated lead plaintiffs and ex ante fee agreements are driving this result. Over 75% of the cases in high-volume districts with fee requests below 20% involved public pension lead plaintiffs. Just under 50% of such cases had evidence of an ex ante fee agreement.\n\nA similar pattern emerges when we compare high- to low-volume judges (Figure 3). In both sub-samples, there are scale effects, but the rate of decline is much sharper for both requests and awards when a high-volume judge hears the case. Here, too, caution is prudent because other case characteristics could be driving these results. Nonetheless, the picture that is beginning to emerge is one that is far more nuanced than indicated in previous studies. Not surprisingly, it appears that lawyers behave strategically based on the court in which they are litigating and the particular judge before whom they are appearing. It has certainly been known for years that courts and judges are not monolithic when it comes to their fee awards. Some judges have earned reputations for vigorously scrutinizing fee requests and for awarding relatively low fees. What is new, however, is that those differences are not attributable solely to the idiosyncrasies of individual judges. The more experience courts or judges have with securities class actions, the more parsimonious they appear to become. But these phenomena are not simply the product of experienced courts or judges slashing fee requests more than their less experienced counterparts (a point we address in more detail below). Lawyers appear to be anticipating what the court is likely to do, asking for lower fees (particularly as cases get larger) when they appear in courts with large numbers of class actions or before high-frequency judges, and asking for higher fees in other situations.\n\nFigure 3: Fee Requests and Awards in Cases with Low and High Volume Judges\n\nThe fee request–award dynamic thus appears to be a complex version of the Ultimatum Game, a classic of behavioral economics in which two players decide how to divide a fixed sum of money. In the standard form of the game, the Proposer is asked to allocate a sum of money between herself and the other player, the Responder. The Responder may either accept the offer (in which case the money is split as proposed) or reject it. In the latter case, neither player receives any­thing. Under the traditional assumptions of classical economics, the Proposer should offer the Responder the smallest sum of money possible and the Responder should accept it because she will be better off than with the alternative (which is nothing). But repeated experi­ments have shown that Responders tend to reject offers that are too far outside what might be considered the objectively fair outcome, an even split. In the majority of studies, offers tend to average between 40% to 50% of the fixed total sum, with responders usually rejecting offers below 30%. Proposers, in other words, appear to anticipate these reactions and so tend to offer divisions that fall within the likely acceptable range.\n\nAn attorney’s decision about what fee to request in a class action shares some basic characteristics with the Ultimatum Game. As in the game, the attorney must propose a division of a fixed sum of money. There are two key differences. The first is that in the absence of an ex ante fee agreement, the court rather than the lead plaintiff will play the role of the Responder, although in doing so it is supposed to be acting in the best interests of the class. The second is that the court has the final decision about how the pot will be split. But the existence of an accepted range of fair values—in this case the existing precedents regarding fee awards—will tend to constrain the attorney’s decision about what fee to propose. Indeed, in variations on the Ultimatum Game in which Proposers have information about which offers have been accepted in the past, offers tend to converge toward those demonstrably acceptable values. Rather than run the risk that a court will respond to a high demand by awarding an especially low fee, lawyers appear to make proposals that are within a range of values deemed to be fair, given the precedents in the relevant jurisdiction. The difference between high- and low-volume districts is that in the former there are likely to be more precedents and a tighter range of “fair values,” which constrain class counsel’s ability to request as much as the lawyers might want. In low-volume districts and with judges who handle these cases infrequently, there are fewer precedents, allowing attorneys to pitch their requests at the higher end of the perceived “fair value” range. Simply put, lawyers ask for as much as they think they can reasonably get, but what they think they can get will vary depending on where and before whom a case is pending.\n\nThis dynamic changes when a sophisticated institutional investor serves as the lead plaintiff. Particularly where that lead plaintiff negotiates fee terms ex ante with retained counsel, the lead plaintiff has the ability to engage in real arm’s-length negotiations, rather than simply responding to the lawyer’s fee proposal. In the former case, the parties are likely to take into account the anticipated risks associated with the case and will have incentives to design fee structures that maximize the plaintiffs’ net recovery. The latter involves a zero-sum game—every dollar the judge gives the lawyers is a dollar out of the class members’ pockets. As we discuss in Part III, there are substantial reasons to believe that, given the dynamics and uncertainties inherent in class-action litigation, sophisticated lead plaintiffs who negotiate fees with their counsel at the start of litigation are better suited to setting fees appropriately—that is, to paying the “market rate”—than are judges who simply respond to fee requests after the substantive aspects of the case are complete.\n\nC. Judicial Fee Reductions. — If we anticipate that lawyers will moderate their fee requests when they appear in high-volume districts or before high-volume judges, then it is difficult to predict the frequency with which different courts will cut requested fees. On one level, fee cuts might in general be quite infrequent. This would be so if lawyers accurately anticipate the amounts judges are willing to award and tailor their fee requests accordingly. One might also expect fee cuts to be less frequent among experienced judges and in experienced courts because lawyers’ predictions will be better informed. Alternatively, because a low-volume court has comparatively little basis for comparison when presented with a given fee request, it might be inclined to find reasonable a fee request that a high-volume court would consider “high” or “too high.” As we noted previously, fee requests are typically non-adversarial. Defendants are indifferent to fee awards because they are paid out of the common fund and objectors tend to be infrequent. As a result, lawyers requesting fees may be inclined to skew their briefs toward the higher end of the range of perceived “fair values.” Under these circumstances, a court that sees securities class actions infrequently might cut fees only rarely.\n\nAs it turns out, fee-cut decisions do present something of a mixed bag. As shown in Table 2, in 14.39% of cases (that is, in 62 of the 431 cases in the data set), the court awarded a smaller fee than lead counsel requested. Put another way, in 6 out of 7 cases, plaintiffs’ counsel received precisely the fee requested. From this perspective, courts seem to take a light touch, but that conclusion needs to be placed in context. Concerns about judicial fee cuts have less to do with their frequency than with the circumstances under which they occur.\n\nMoreover, judicial aggressiveness when reviewing fee requests often comes from within. In only 19 of the 62 cases in which fees were reduced (30.65%) did an objector formally challenge the size of the requested fee. Thus, in 7 out of 10 cases in which the court cut the requested attorneys’ fees, the court did so sua sponte, without the lead plaintiff or any other class member questioning the size of the fee request.\n\nIndeed, the willingness of judges to cut fees appears to be unrelated to actual objections from class members to proposed fees. If we measure the ratio of award to request, we find that for the overall sample the mean is 0.9683. That is, on average, lawyers could expect to get 97 cents for every dollar they requested in fees. In the subset of cases in which the court cut fees, the average fee award is actually higher when there is an objection to the fee request (80 cents on the dollar) than when there is no objection (77 cents on the dollar), although the difference is not statistically significant. The requested fees in the 62 fee-cut cases ranged from 6.54% to 33.33% of the relevant recovery, with the fee awards ranging from 6.29% to 30.00%. The mean (median) ratio of award to request in these cases was 0.7828 (0.800), with a range from 0.2533 to 0.9908. The data also provide mixed evidence about the deference that courts show to large institutional lead plaintiffs. Based simply on broad descriptive statistics, we found that fee cuts were neither more prevalent when an individual was the lead plaintiff in the case nor less prevalent when a public pension fund was the lead plaintiff, two relationships that might be expected given that the PSLRA encourages courts to defer to institutional investors. Individuals were lead plaintiffs in 40.32% of the cases with fee cuts. These differences between individuals and other lead plaintiff types were not significant. There does seem to be, however, some relationship between the type of lead plaintiff and the size of the fee cut. The mean ratio of award to request is significantly higher in cases with a public pension lead plaintiff (0.9821) than in cases with other lead plaintiff types (0.9611), indicating that courts cut fees less in cases with public pension funds. This deference is consistent with the general view among academics that public pension funds, which have large portfolios, few conflicts of interest, and a high degree of sophistication, are best suited to serve as monitors in securities class actions.\n\nWe also found limited evidence, again based on simple frequency comparisons, that courts show greater deference to fee requests that were the product of ex ante fee agreements. Judges did not award the request­ed fee in 8.97% of the settlements with ex ante fee agreements compared to 15.58% of the cases without such agreements. Although fee cuts were twice as likely in cases without ex ante agreements, the difference in frequencies was not statistically significant. Within the fee-cut cases, there was no significant difference in the ratio of award to request for cases with ex ante fee agreements (0.8210) and those without (0.7779). The same was largely true across the entire sample. Overall, lawyers were awarded 98.42% of their requested fees in cases with ex ante fee agreements compared to 96.48% in cases without such agreements, a difference that was significant at about the 10% level. Nor is there evidence that the lead plaintiff’s expressing support of the requested fee made a difference in the likelihood of a judicial fee cut. Cuts were about as likely in the cases with such support (12.75%) as in those without it (15.30%).\n\nAs in the other aspects the study examined, however, there is some evidence of inter-court and inter-judge variation. High-volume districts appear to scrutinize fee requests somewhat more vigorously than low-volume districts. To be sure, the overall level of judicial scrutiny remains quite low. The average ratio of award to request in high-volume districts (0.9571) is significantly lower than in low-volume districts (0.9789). Most striking is the fact that fee cuts are almost twice as likely in the high-volume districts (18.66% of cases) as in the low-volume districts (10.36% of cases). A similar pattern emerges for the judges who most frequently rule on fee requests. Fee cuts are more likely among high-volume judges (19.12%) than among low-volume judges (12.20%), although the difference is significant at only the 10% level. High-volume judges also have lower ratios of award to request (0.9580) than low-volume judges (0.9731), but the difference is not significant. Indeed, in the sub-sample of cases with fee cuts, there are no significant differences in the size of cuts among high-volume and low-volume districts or among judges who see these cases more or less frequently.\n\nTable 3: Rationales for Judicial Fee Reductions\n\nRationale Number (Frequency) The requested fee is “too large” 25 (40.32%) The requested fee is “too large given the work performed by the attorneys” 22 (35.48%) The requested fee is “too large given lead counsel’s actual risk of non-recovery” 19 (30.65%) Requested fee is “out of line with fees in similar cases” 19 (30.65%) Requested fee fails a lodestar cross-check 20 (32.26%) The court cannot rely on the market for setting attorneys’ fees 3 (4.84%) Requested fee not the result of arm’s-length bargaining 1 (1.61%)\n\nThere does appear to be some difference, however, between the deference that high-volume judges give to ex ante fee agreements compared to their low-volume counterparts. In only 2 of 32 cases (6.25%) in which a high-volume judge was evaluating a fee request that was the product of an ex ante agreement did that judge reduce the requested fee. By comparison, low-volume judges reduced requested fees in 5 of 46 cases with ex ante fee agreements (10.87%). Although the numbers are too small to demonstrate statistical significance, they suggest that judges who see more securities class actions may defer more readily to negotiated fee agreements.\n\nFinally, we examined the rationales courts offered for their decisions to reduce the requested fees. Given that fee awards raise significant policy concerns regarding the structure of the civil litigation system and its deterrent effects, and given the importance of fee awards to lawyers and class members, one might hope that judges would give some explanation for their decisions to cut the requested fees. That is simply not the case. In 40.3% (25) of the 62 fee-reduction cases, the court gave no reason or justification at all for its decision to cut the fee; it simply awarded a lower percentage or dollar amount than that requested by lead counsel. In the remaining cases, the court gave one or more reasons for the fee reduction, which are summarized in Table 3. For the most part, judges offered only the most cursory explanations for their decisions. When courts offered other explanations, such as the low risk the case entailed, or the low quality or excessive quantity of the work performed by the attorneys, these discussions were usually cursory at best. The typical decision was an unpublished order only a few pages in length. While hardly adequate, these decisions were often an improvement over the cases in which the court awarded the requested fee without any reduction. In many of those cases, courts simply signed a conclusory proposed order that class counsel had submitted with its fee application. In those cases, it is difficult to avoid the inference that the court simply rubber-stamped the requested fee with little if any independent evaluation or analysis.\n\nCourts’ unwillingness or inability to explain why they award the fees they do leaves important questions unanswered. Are fee awards random or is there a pattern to the data? What factors do courts really consider in determining whether a fee request is reasonable? Do courts actually apply the factors they claim to consider? Are there systematic differences among courts or among judges in awarding fees? Do lawyers know about these differences and exploit them in their fee requests? What, if any, role do ex ante fee agreements play in fee awards? What factors explain judicial decisions to cut requested fees? The next section examines these questions in greater depth.\n\n2. Regression Analyses. — To better understand how ex ante fee agreements, the participation of public pension funds, and judicial experience with securities class actions are correlated with fee requests and awards, we constructed a series of linear regressions with either the fee request or the fee award as the dependent variable. We included indicator variables for: (1) evidence of an ex ante fee agreement (Ex Ante); (2) whether there was competition for the lead plaintiff position (Competition); (3) the presence of a public pension fund (Public Pension) or other institutional investor (Other Institution) as lead plaintiff; (4) the age of the case in years from filing until the date the court awarded attorneys’ fees (Case Age); (5) whether the case was litigated in a high-volume district for securities class actions (High Volume); and (6) whether the case was litigated in front of a high-volume judge (High Volume Judge). As an alternative way of measuring judicial experience with securities class actions, we created an additional variable (Judge Frequency) which measures the actual number of fee decisions a judge has in our data set. In our regressions for fee awards, we also included indicator variables for: (1) whether an objection to the fee was filed (Fee Objection), and (2) whether the court cut the requested fee (Cut). All models include as an independent variable the log-transformed, inflation-adjusted settlement in the case. To give a clear sense of the magnitude of the effects these variables have, we centered the regressions at the mean settlement size in the database ($52.2 million).\n\nTo analyze the circumstances in which courts reduce the requested fee, we also constructed a logit model which takes Cut as a dependent variable. This regression employs independent variables that are largely observable by case participants when the fee request is made. Using these variables enables us to determine whether class counsel can make reliable predictions as to when fee cuts are likely. To a large extent, the variables are the same ones used in the regressions for fee awards and requests.\n\na. Fee Requests. — Although infrequent, ex ante fee agreements appear to have a powerful influence over fee requests. The effect of an ex ante fee agreement on a fee request is negative and significant, both statistically and economically, even controlling for other relevant variables. At the mean settlement value, the average fee request in a case without an ex ante agreement is 29.8% of the settlement amount (or $15.56 million). By contrast, the mean fee request in cases with an ex ante agreement was 23.8% (or $12.42 million), a 20% reduction in the fee requested. The presence of a public pension fund has similar effects. Cases with public pension lead plaintiffs have fee requests that average 24.8%, a reduction of about $2.6 million at the mean settlement amount. Other types of lead plaintiffs, including union-affiliated pension funds and other kinds of private institutional investors, have no statistically significant correlation with fee requests, a result that is consistent with prior studies.\n\nTable 4: Regressions for Fee Requests\n\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Settlement -0.006* -0.001 -0.001 -0.001 -0.001 -0.001 -0.001 (0.003) (0.004) (0.005) (0.004) (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) Competition -0.012*** -0.012*** -0.012*** -0.012*** -0.013*** -0.013*** -0.014*** (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) Public Pension -0.050*** -0.043*** -0.050*** -0.049*** -0.050*** -0.049*** -0.049*** (0.009) (0.012) (0.009) (0.009) (0.009) (0.009) (0.009) Other Institution -0.003 -0.004 -0.003 -0.004 -0.003 -0.003 -0.003 (0.004) (0.003) (0.003) (0.003) (0.003) (0.004) (0.003) Ex Ante Agreement -0.060*** -0.043*** -0.057*** -0.057*** -0.058*** -0.058*** -0.059*** (0.015) (0.010) (0.013) (0.012) (0.014) (0.014) (0.014) High Volume District -0.028*** -0.041*** -0.035*** -0.023*** -0.038*** -0.032*** -0.044*** (0.005) (0.004) (0.005) (0.005) (0.006) (0.007) (0.008) Case Age (Years) -0.003* -0.003* -0.003** -0.003** -0.003** -0.003** -0.003** (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) Settlement x High Volume -0.010** -0.009** -0.009* -0.010** -0.009* -0.009** (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) Public Pension x Ex Ante -0.035 (0.031) Judge Frequency -0.004*** -0.001 (0.001) (0.002) High Volume x Judge Frequency -0.005** (0.002) High Volume Judge -0.014*** -0.003 (0.004) (0.006) High Volume Judge x.

On average, the fee requests in cases with such competition decline from 29.8% to 28.6%. Competition seems not to influence fee award size directly, however, because compensation terms do not influence judges’ decisions to appoint lead plaintiffs. Instead, competition may be a proxy for case quality. Higher quality encourages lawyers to seek control of class actions because it implies lower risk, and it induces them to compete on price for the same reason.\n\nPerhaps the most significant finding in Model 1 is that plaintiffs’ attorneys appear to adjust their fee requests based on the volume of securities class actions settled in the district court where a case is pending. The variable High Volume is negative and significant. All else being equal, fee requests in the Northern and Central Districts of California and in the Southern District of New York (which collectively see roughly half of all securities class actions) are, on average, 2.8% lower than requests in other districts. At the mean settlement value, the lead counsel in a case in a high-volume district asks for about $1.46 million less in fees than in a case filed in a low-volume district.\n\nTo further examine this relationship, Model 2 includes two interactions—(1) between Mean Settlement and High Volume and (2) between Ex Ante and Public Pension—in order to test the combined effects of those variables on fee requests. With these interactions, the constant in Model 2 (0.305) represents the average fee request in a case litigated in a low-volume district without either an ex ante fee agreement or a public pension lead plaintiff. As noted previously, one of the most consistent results in studies of attorneys’ fees in class actions generally is that settlement size is strongly correlated with fee requests and awards. Researchers have found that as settlements increase, fee requests (measured as a percentage of the settlement) decrease. The overwhelming empirical support for this proposition makes one result in Model 2 particularly notable. With an interaction term between settlement size and high-volume districts, the variable Settlement is now negative but insignificant. What does this result mean? In districts that see few securities class actions, fee requests do not appear to vary significantly with the size of the settlement. In other words, regardless of settlement size, when a lead counsel in a low-volume district is not constrained by either a negotiated ex ante fee agreement or an active public pension lead plaintiff, the counsel requests fees of around 30% of the settlement.\n\nBy contrast, in high-volume districts fee requests are significantly lower, averaging 26.4% at the mean settlement value, about a $2.1 million reduction in the requested fee. It is important to emphasize that this reduction in fee requests occurs even in the absence of a public pension lead plaintiff or an ex ante fee agreement, suggesting that it is the court with relatively greater experience handling securities class actions that is providing this moderating influence. This finding substantially modifies the existing understanding of the relationship between fee requests and settlement size in class action settlements. Previously, most scholars have concluded that class action fee requests declined uniformly across courts as settlement size increased. But the results here suggest both imperfect information (by courts and plaintiffs) in the market for fees and plaintiffs’ attorneys who seemingly seek to exploit that information asymmetry. The decline in fee requests associated with increasingly large settlements is driven almost entirely by the requests made to the subset of courts that see these cases most frequently. Outside of that handful of districts, lawyers appear to ask for uniform fees, regardless of settlement size.\n\nHow big is the difference in fee requests in high- versus low-volume districts when the settlements involved are substantially larger than average? This relationship can be seen in the interaction between Settlement and High Volume, which was negative and significant. This result indicates that as settlement values increase, the distance between fee requests in low- versus high-volume districts continues to widen. To understand the magnitude of this effect, consider a one-standard-deviation increase in the size of the settlement, which would mean a settlement of approximately $217.2 million. In the absence of either a public pension lead plaintiff or an ex ante fee agreement, the average fee request in a low-volume district is 30.3%, virtually unchanged from the fee request for an average settlement. In the same case in a high-volume district, the average fee request is only 23.8%. At these averages, class counsel could be expected to ask for $14.1 million more in fees in the case litigated in the low-volume district. These differences suggest substantial, previously undocumented inefficiencies in the market for attorneys’ fees in securities class actions. Lawyers, who naturally act in accordance with their own financial best interests, appear to be aware of these inefficiencies and strategically adjust their fee requests to take advantage of them.\n\nThe question that naturally arises concerns the mechanism though which high-volume courts can have this moderating influence on fee requests. What prevents an attorney (at least in the absence of an ex ante fee agreement or a sophisticated public pension fund) from asking for the same fees in both high- and low-volume districts? One obvious way courts might influence fee requests is through their fee award prece­dents. For example, the Ninth Circuit explicitly uses a benchmark fee of 25% in securities class actions, a percentage that is similar to the nationwide average fee request we report. A benchmark, of course, works uniformly, regardless of settlement size, but precedents need not be so precise to have a moderating influence on fee requests. The Second Circuit, for example, does not explicitly use such a benchmark, but in numerous cases district courts there have awarded fees substantially below 25%, and the Court of Appeals has suggested that fees in securities cases are too high. As indicated earlier, a judge in a high-volume district is also more likely to have ready access to, or feel obliged to seek out and consider, the body of unpublished fee decisions from the same district. Those decisions may affect published decisions within the district, ultimately making it more difficult for class counsel to request fees that are substantially out of line with the fees other judges from the same court have awarded in larger cases.\n\nThe final question that Model 2 addresses is whether the effects that public pension lead plaintiffs and ex ante agreements have on fee requests are conditional, or are simply two different ways of measuring the same thing—the influence that an active, sophisticated lead plaintiff has on fee requests. With the interaction between Public Pension and Ex Ante included in the regression, the two separate individual variables now represent partial effects—the effect of a public pension lead plaintiff without an ex ante agreement and vice versa at mean settlement values. Both individual variables remain negative and significant in Model 2, with magnitudes that are identical. In the presence of either a public pension lead plaintiff or an ex ante agreement, fee requests average just under 26.2%, all else being equal. The interaction term in Model 2, while negative, is insignificant. In other words, there is no evidence of any greater effect on fee requests when the class action has both a negotiated ex ante fee agreement and a public pension lead plaintiff. Consequently, it appears that each of these two variables is indeed measuring the influence of an active, sophisticated lead plaintiff on fee requests. Together they suggest that this aspect of the PSLRA is working largely as Congress intended. In cases where a real plaintiff plays a meaningful role in selecting and retaining counsel, some of the agency costs typically associated with securities class actions are reduced.\n\nModels 3 through 6 supplement the analysis of high-volume districts by looking at whether attorneys moderate their fee requests when they appear before judges with significant experience handling securities class actions. The descriptive statistics for the sample suggested precisely this kind of strategic behavior, and these regressions confirm those results. Whether judicial experience is measured as the total number of decisions the judge has in the data set (Models 3 and 4) or if instead by pooling high-volume judges (Models 5 and 6), the same dynamic emerges. The more experience an individual judge has with securities class actions, the lower the fees that class counsel requests. This phenomenon, however, appears to be limited to experienced judges in high-volume districts. In models with an interaction for high-volume districts and judges, the interaction is negative and significant while the variable that measures judicial experience is insignificant. This result suggests that lawyers put a great deal of care into structuring their fee requests. For the most experienced judges in high-volume districts, fee requests average 4.9% less than requests made to less experienced judges in low-volume districts. Experienced judges in low-volume districts (now represented by the Judge Frequency or High Volume Judge variables) see fee requests that are statistically indistinguishable from their colleagues who have seen fewer such cases.\n\nPlaintiffs’ lawyers in securities class actions take seriously the deci­sion to lower their fee requests. They certainly do so in the presence of a public pension lead plaintiff or an ex ante fee agreement. But in situations where the lead plaintiff does not appear to be monitoring their behavior, attorneys ask for uniformly high fees regardless of settlement size. As section II.B.1.b shows, experienced judges from districts that see these cases frequently award lower fees. Attorneys appear to anticipate these awards and moderate their requests when they appear before these judges.\n\nOne way to see how limited the situations are in which attorneys will independently reduce their fee requests is to flip the analysis around to focus on the least experienced judges. Model 7 includes a variable (One Opinion) that takes a value of 1 if a judge has only one fee decision in the data set and 0 otherwise. Since that opinion must come from the same case, the lawyers effectively have no information about how that particular judge might award fees. As in previous models, Model 7 interacts this variable with the High Volume district variable. The fee requests made to judges from low-volume districts with only one decision are indistinguishable from the average fee request of about 31% made in a low-volume district. For experienced judges in high-volume districts, fee requests are on average 4.40% lower than fee requests in low-volume districts. For judges without an established track record in high-volume districts, however, fee requests are 1.90% higher than more experienced judges in those districts. Fee requests remain lower for inexperienced judges in high-volume districts than for judges in low-volume districts (presumably because of the abundance of precedents from other judges in the district supporting lower fees), but not as low as for judges from the high-volume district with a more established record. These findings support the hypothesis that plaintiffs’ attorneys adjust their fee requests according to both the relevant judge’s individual experience and the collective experience of the relevant court in litigating securities class actions.\n\nb. Fee Awards. — The models in Table 5 examine how the same variables we analyzed with respect to fee requests affect fee awards. The descriptive statistics suggest that in a typical case the judge displays a relatively light touch when it comes to reducing the requested fees. Fee cuts occur in a minority of cases. While such cuts can be large when they occur, on average lawyers get the vast majority of the fees they request—as illustrated earlier, about 97 cents on the dollar. The higher fee requests observed in low-volume districts suggest that attorneys might anticipate higher fee awards when their cases are litigated in those districts.\n\nTable 5: Regressions for Fee Awards\n\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Settlement -0.007* -0.002 -0.002 -0.002 -0.001 -0.002 -0.002 (0.003) (0.004) (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) (0.005) Competition -0.010*** -0.009*** -0.009*** -0.010*** -0.010*** -0.010*** -0.011*** (0.003) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) (0.002) Public Pension -0.045*** -0.037*** -0.045*** -0.044*** -0.045*** -0.045*** -0.044*** (0.008) (0.011) (0.008) (0.008) (0.009) (0.009) (0.008) Other Institution -0.003 -0.004 -0.004 -0.004 -0.004 -0.004 -0.004 (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) Ex Ante Agreement -0.057*** -0.038*** -0.054*** -0.054*** -0.055*** -0.055*** -0.056*** (0.016) (0.011) (0.014) (0.013) (0.015) (0.015) (0.015) Objection -0.003 -0.003 -0.005 -0.005 -0.005 -0.005 -0.004 (0.007) (0.008) (0.008) (0.008) (0.007) (0.007) (0.008) Fee Cut -0.038*** -0.037*** -0.039*** -0.039*** -0.038*** -0.039*** -0.038*** (0.004) (0.004) (0.006) (0.006) (0.005) (0.006) (0.004) High Volume District -0.031*** -0.042*** -0.036*** -0.023*** -0.039*** -0.033*** -0.046*** (0.005) (0.005) (0.006) (0.004) (0.006) (0.007) (0.008) Case Age (Years) -0.002 -0.002 -0.002* -0.002* -0.002* -0.002* -0.003* (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) (0.001) Settlement x High Volume -0.009* -0.008* -0.008* -0.009* -0.008* -0.008* (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) (0.004) Public Pension x Ex Ante -0.040 (0.031) Judge Frequency -0.004*** -0.001 (0.001) (0.002) High Volume x Judge Frequency -0.005** (0.002) High Volume Judge -0.016*** -0.004 (0.004) (0.006) High Vol. Judge x High Volume -0.018* (0.009) One Opinion 0.002 (0.007) One Opinion x High Volume 0.019** (0.007) Constant 0.291*** 0.295*** 0.309*** 0.302*** 0.304*** 0.302*** 0.301*** (0.007) (0.008) (0.011) (0.010) (0.010) (0.010) (0.012) Observations 431 431 431 431 431 431 431 R-squared 0.419 0.438 0.439 0.443 0.436 0.439 0.434\n\nAs in the models for fee requests, Model 1 in Table 5 begins without interaction terms. At mean settlement values, fee awards in low-volume districts average 29.1%. In high-volume districts, fee awards average 26.0%. In either kind of district, ex ante fee agreements and public pension lead plaintiffs have a significant moderating influence on fees. Average fees in all cases with an ex ante fee agreement are 23.4% at mean settlement values. For cases with public pension lead plaintiffs, fee awards average 24.6%. When judges cut fees, we observe reductions of similar magnitude: Fee cuts average about 3.8%.\n\nIt is noteworthy that when courts award a fee that is lower than the requested amount they apparently pay little heed to objectors. We found no evidence that objections to fee requests have any significant relationship to fee awards. There are several potential explanations for this result. One is that objections are infrequent. Objections to fee requests were filed in only about one-fifth of the cases (22.97%), and one-third of the cases with objections (34.34%) had only a single objection. Of the 125 cases with any kind of objection, only 20 (16.00%) had 5 or more objections. Most courts consider a low rate of objections to be support for the proposed settlement and fee, although the strength of such an inference seems dubious given the collective-action problems facing class members. Many plaintiffs’ lawyers complain about the presence of “professional objectors,” who file pro forma objections to proposed class settlements simply in an attempt to extract a greater share of the settlement or to garner attorneys’ fees for providing what they contend are independent benefits to the class. If courts believe that these professional objectors predominate (and there is some evidence that they do), it is not surprising that courts pay little attention to objectors when awarding fees.\n\nCompetition for the lead plaintiff position at the start of the case is also correlated with lower fee awards at the end of the case. On average, fee awards are about 1% less in cases with that kind of competition. While it is possible that competition signals to the court that the case is more lucrative and perhaps less risky, leading to a reduction in fees, this does not appear to be the case. Instead, the magnitude of the decline in fee awards is about the same as the decline in fee requests in these cases. In other words, courts appear to be awarding lower fees in cases with competitors for the lead plaintiff position because attorneys are asking for lower fees in those cases. This result, along with the general ineffectiveness of objections to fee requests, underscores the importance of focusing on ex ante versus ex post strategies for addressing fees, a matter treated in more detail in Part III.\n\nThe models for fee requests, showed a weak (negative) correlation with Case Age. Model 1 shows no statistically significant correlation between the number of years the case was litigated and the size of fee awards, although some of the other models demonstrate a weak (negative) correlation. The mixed evidence for this variable is interesting, given the standards courts typically employ in awarding fees. For example, Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., one of the leading class action fee precedents, adopts a twelve-part test for evaluating fee requests. Two elements of that test—“the time and labor required” to reach the settlement and the opportunity costs associated with taking a particular case—relate to the length of time a case has been litigated. The duration of the case is also correlated, albeit imperfectly, to the hours an attorney has devoted to a case. Indeed, consistent with appellate court precedent in the Ninth, Second, and Third Circuits, a sub­stantial minority of courts in our nationwide data set (45.01%) used a lodestar cross-check to evaluate the requested fee. The prevalence of these time-based factors in legal doctrine and the insignificance of Case Age in our findings suggest a substantial disconnect between what these courts say they do and what they actually do when awarding fees. Instead, courts in practice seem to follow something closer to a pure percentage approach to fee awards.\n\nGiven the prevalence among courts of using a lodestar cross-check to justify fee awards, we investigated whether there is any evidence that this procedure has any meaningful impact on fees. Although the results are not reported separately in Table 5, a regression similar to Model 2 was run that included as an explanatory variable whether the court stated in its fee order that it had used a lodestar cross-check in arriving at its fee award. If this approach by courts was useful, the regression should show systematic differences between those courts that use a cross-check versus those courts that award fees on a simple percentage basis. That is not the case. There was no statistically significant difference between fee awards using a lodestar cross-check and fee awards under the percentage of the recovery approach. This result supports previous academic criticisms of the lodestar methodology. It also suggests that the time and resources lawyers devote to tracking lodestar amounts and the enormous number of hours that some judges spend reviewing firm billing records is largely a waste of time.\n\nEven though cross-checked fee awards do not differ statistically from those based on the percentage method alone, cross-checks may influence the size of awards in ways that are hard to detect. For example, expecting judges to cut fee requests that seem excessive on a lodestar basis, lawyers may moderate their requests before submitting them. Because the vast majority of fee requests (92.33%) included lodestar comparisons, lodestar-related moderation may occur even in circuits that permit judges to award fees on the basis of reasonable percentages alone. That is, lawyers may mask the lodestar method’s fee-constraining effect by anticipating the concerns with hours worked that judges may have.\n\nTo gain more insight into the possible impact of lodestar cross-checks, a regression was run on fee awards in which a fee application’s inclusion or exclusion of a cross-check was an independent variable. Awards were actually 2.4% higher when fee requests included cross-checks than when lawyers urged judges to apply solely the percentage approach. Because the regressions included Case Age as an independent variable (which remained insignificant), the difference cannot be explained by the possibility that cases in which fee requests included lodestar cross-checks warranted higher fees because they took longer to resolve.\n\nAn alternative possibility is that lawyers use lodestar-related information strategically. They may include it when it tends to shore up fee requests that might strike judges as excessive if sought on the basis of percentages alone; and they omit it when they expect judges to grant their percentage-based requests or think that it may tend to make percentage-based requests seem excessive (e.g., because the number of hours expended was small). Although these speculations do not prove that lawyers strategize in the manner described, they have several obvious strengths. They comport with lawyers’ self-interest, which should lead them to couch fee applications as attractively as possible. They take seriously the belief that judges place weight on time expended when sizing fee awards. And they plausibly assume that lawyers base their arguments on prior beliefs about judges’ attitudes.\n\nAs with the analysis of fee requests, Model 2 adds interaction terms between settlement size and high-volume districts and between ex ante agreements and public pension lead plaintiffs. The results continue to be very similar. On average in a low-volume district, courts award attorneys’ fees of about 29.5% in cases without either a public pension lead plaintiff or an ex ante fee agreement. There is no evidence that those fees vary with settlement size. In a high-volume district, by comparison, courts in similar cases award, on average, only 24.4% in attorneys’ fees. The interaction term Settlement x High Volume remains significant in Model 2. On average, fee awards in districts that frequently see securities class actions decline as settlement size increases. For a settlement one standard deviation above the mean ($217.2 million), fee awards in low-volume districts average about 29.2% compared to 22.8% in high-volume districts. This is an average difference of about $13.9 million per fee award, an amount that is both statistically and economically significant.\n\nPut another way, the significance of the interaction between settlement values and high-volume districts with regard to fee awards, as opposed to fee requests, suggests that plaintiffs’ attorneys are able to exploit imperfections in the market for attorneys’ fees. That is, class counsel request larger fees in districts that are more likely to award them. If that were not the case, then fee awards in low-volume districts would match fee awards in high-volume districts, regardless of the size of the fee requests.\n\nIf the PSLRA were working as intended, one would not expect to find inter-court variations like these. Both the plaintiffs’ securities bar and the investment markets operate nationwide; any plaintiffs’ law firm can appear in a securities class action in any federal district court. If lead plaintiffs consistently shopped for lawyers and drove hard bargains when negotiating ex ante fee agreements, one would expect to find fairly uniform fee terms and fee awards across courts after controlling for relevant case characteristics.\n\nPlausibly, judges in low-volume districts are operating in a comparatively lower information environment than their counterparts in high-volume districts. Because they see these cases less frequently and because so many fee awards are unpublished, they have a smaller pool of precedents on which to base their decisions. As noted above, judges seem to generally disregard objectors, perhaps because they deem them an unreliable signal of excessive fee requests. Defendants are indifferent to fee requests because the fees are paid out of the common fund. In such a non-adversarial setting, it is hardly surprising that a time-constrained federal judge would be inclined simply to sign the proposed fee order that class counsel has drafted.\n\nThe effects on fee awards associated with ex ante fee agreements and public pension funds remain the same in Model 2. Individually, both variables are negative and significant, with magnitudes that are roughly similar. The interaction term remains negative, but insignificant. At this stage, there is no evidence of any greater effect on fee awards when there is both an ex ante agreement and a public pension lead plaintiff. The variables Cut and Fee Objection are similar to the results under the previous model. Judicial fee cuts average about 3.7%. There is no evidence that objections are correlated with fee awards.\n\nModels 3 through 7 in Table 5 examine the impact on fee awards of individualized judicial experience with securities class actions. The results mirror those found in the regressions on fee requests. Overall, experienced judges award lower fees than less experienced judges, but this appears to be true only for experienced judges in districts that see substantial securities class action filings. To illustrate this point, consider Models 5 and 6, which included an indicator variable for judges who contributed four or more decisions to the data set. Viewed in isolation (Model 5), all such judges appear to award fees that are, on average, 1.6% lower than those awarded by less experienced judges. But interacting that indicator variable with high-volume districts shows that all the reduction comes from the most experienced judges in the highest volume districts. Contrast that result with judges from high-volume districts with the least amount of experience (Model 7). The fees that the less experienced judges award are lower than those awarded by their counterparts in low-volume districts, but not nearly as low as the awards by more experienced judges in their own districts. These results suggest that the more judges see securities class actions, the less willing they are to award fees to the attorneys who bring them.\n\nc. Judicial Fee Reductions. — In order to evaluate the relative impact of ex ante and ex post approaches to attorneys’ fees, it is useful to consider the variables correlated with judicial fee reductions. To do that, the study contains a logit model with Cut as the dependent variable. The model uses the same variables employed in this Article’s fee regressions because we wanted to see whether these variables could also predict the cases in which fee cuts occurred. What is noteworthy about these variables is that, with the exception of Objection, they are readily observable to case participants prior to any fee application. The coefficients for the logit model reported in Table 6 are the marginal effects of each independent variable when the other independent variables are set to their means.\n\nTable 6: Logit Regression for Judicial Fee Reductions\n\nAverage Marginal Effect Standard Error Settlement 0.071*** 0.021 Competition -0.007 0.037 Public Pension -0.121*** 0.044 Other Institution -0.019 0.037 Ex Ante Agreement -0.116** 0.053 High Volume District 0.064 0.049 Case Age (Years) -0.011 0.009 Objection 0.014 0.041 Settlement x High Volume -0.037* 0.022 High Volume Judge 0.130** 0.058 High Volume Judge x High Volume -0.136* 0.071 Observations 431 Pseudo R-squared 0.0997\n\nTable 6 shows that there are some variables that increase or decrease the probability of a fee cut. For example, there is evidence that courts do in fact defer to the fee arrangements negotiated by public pension funds and to ex ante agreements. Indeed, the effect on the probability of these two variables is nearly identical. In the presence of either one, the probability of a fee cut declines by about 12%.\n\nTable 6 also shows that, all else being equal, the probability that the judge will reduce the requested fee is related to the settlement size. A closer look at those probabilities, however, shows a seemingly anomalous result. The likelihood of a fee cut increases in low-volume districts (represented here by the Settlement variable). By contrast, in high-volume districts (Settlement x High Volume), the probability of a fee cut decreases with settlement size. The explanation for this counter-intuitive result most likely lies in the findings with respect to fee requests. On average, as settlement size increased, plaintiffs sought lower fees in high-volume versus low-volume districts. With lower fee requests, there was likely less need for high-volume courts to cut fees. A similar dynamic occurs with high-volume judges. Outside the high-volume districts, judges with more experience with securities class actions are more likely to cut fees. In high-volume districts, because the most experienced judges see lower fee requests, they are less likely to cut the requested fees. In other words, ex ante steps to reduce fee requests reduce the likelihood that judges will make ex post adjustments in their fee awards.\n\nWhile these results are consistent with the linear regressions for requests and awards, it is important to recognize the limitations in this analysis. Perhaps the best way to evaluate the utility of a logit model is to see how well it classifies cases. In other words, do the model’s predictions for which cases will have fee cuts match up with what actually happened in the cases in the sample? Overall, the model correctly predicted 85.61% of the cases. In the abstract, that sounds like a powerful predictive tool, until one realizes that there were no fee cuts in 85.61% of the cases in the database. Identical results would be obtained by simply guessing that there were no fee reductions in any of the sampled cases in the study. A closer examination reveals just how poorly the model performs. It correctly predicted all but 2 of the 369 cases without fee cuts, but identified only 2 of the 62 cases in which reductions actually occurred. In other words, when it came to identifying the situations in which judges did cut fees, the model was wrong more than 96% of the time.\n\nNotwithstanding the model’s low predictive power, it does illustrate that ex ante fee agreements, public pension lead plaintiffs, and judicial experience are all associated with the probability of a fee cut. The real lesson of the analysis, however, is that these variables tell only a small part of the story. Logically, that realization suggests two possible alternatives. The first is that judicial fee reductions are, for all intents and purposes, random events. The second is that other unobserved (and perhaps unobservable) case or judicial characteristics play the dominant role in determining whether the court will cut fees.\n\nEither scenario raises serious questions about how fees are set in securities class actions (and in class actions of other types). Some judges may believe they have the ability to identify and accurately reduce “excessive” fee requests, but if they do they are relying on criteria other than those tested here. The standards that courts explicitly employ also contemplate that judges have the ability to assess ex post a vast array of factors, including how hard the attorneys worked, how much risk they faced, the quality of the results they obtained, and the relationship of the fee request to similar cases. Perhaps long experience with any given case or with securities class actions more generally provides judges information that is more nuanced than can be captured here. Indeed, that might partially explain why fees in high-volume districts differ so dramatically from fees in low-volume districts.\n\nBut something more is likely going on. Perhaps the unpredictability of fee cuts derives from the fact that fee reductions are primarily the product of subjective assessments by judges based on their own idiosyncrasies, biases, and heuristics rather than the objective facts of any given case. Temperament, judicial philosophy, experience with class action litigation, personal wealth, pre–judicial work history, personal earnings history, political ideology, and other individual and largely unobservable judicial characteristics may well—consciously or unconsciously—drive judges’ decisions about whether and how much to reduce fees. Indeed, the importance of such variables might partially explain the finding that in one-third of the fee-reduction cases the court offered no justification or explanation at all for its decision. When courts do offer an explanation, the most common one is simply that the requested fee is “too large.”\n\nThis study’s data show that class counsel can expect some kind of fee reduction in about one out of every seven cases, and that some judges may be more likely than others to cut the requested fees. But whether fees will be cut in any particular case will likely be impossible to determine at the time the fee request is made. And little more is likely to be known after a given court’s fee ruling because the courts’ fee opinions offer no reliable explanations for those decisions.\n\nThe inability to account for fee cuts in securities class actions on the basis of objective factors raises a broader concern for class actions of all types. The unpredictability of fee cuts implies that, to a significant extent, fee awards are unpredictable too. This is likely true for all class actions, because the doctrines and procedures that govern fee awards are largely the same across different substantive areas of the law. If anything, fee awards in other types of federal lawsuits may be more uncertain than those in securities fraud class actions because the PSLRA applies only to the latter. In cases of other types, fee awards are governed by federal common law, which places only the weakest of constraints on the discretion of district court judges. Uncertainty regarding fees can be expected to discourage lawyers from investing optimally in class actions by creating downside risks that lawyers will avoid. This uncertainty ultimately harms both class members (by impairing the quality of the representation they receive) and the general public (by weakening the deterrent effect of the law).\n\n* * *\n\nThe picture that emerges from these nationwide data is both nuanced and significantly different from the one Congress had in mind when it gave lead plaintiffs responsibility for handling attorneys’ fees in securities class actions. Our data suggest that some lead plaintiffs do take seriously the responsibility Congress bestowed on them, carefully choosing their lawyers, aggressively negotiating fees with them upfront, and actively monitoring them throughout. But such plaintiffs are in the minority. In most cases, lead plaintiffs appear passive, seemingly agreeing at the time of settlement to whatever fees their attorneys deem appropriate.\n\nEven more troubling are our findings regarding the role of the courts in the fee-setting process. We found no evidence that the actions taken by the courts move class counsel’s fees closer to the “right price.” Instead, the data showed that the courts facilitate, rather than prevent, the exploitation of market imperfections by class counsel, enabling them systematically to obtain higher fees from courts and judges that see securities class actions less frequently than from more experienced courts. And although judges do sometimes cut class counsel’s fees, those decisions were unpredictable. That is, judicial fee cuts are as likely to result in fees that are further from the “right price” as they are to move them closer to that ideal.\n\nIn sum, there is little to celebrate in the current state of affairs, and reason to think that even small improvements in the fee-setting process might yield significantly better results.\n\nIII. Should Courts Set Fees Ex Ante? A Proposal\n\nThis Part considers some possible improvements to the current process by which class counsel’s fees are determined under the PSLRA. Section III.A begins by examining previous reform proposals. Section III.B then offers an original reform proposal, which we believe improves upon those prior efforts.\n\nA. Prior Reform Proposals\n\nIn 2002, a Task Force convened by the Third Circuit issued a report on the manner of selecting and compensating lawyers who handle class actions. It encouraged judges presiding over securities cases to base fee awards on negotiated agreements between lead plaintiffs and class counsel. After observing that “[t]he PSLRA establishes a model of client control that extends . . . to . . . negotiation of the fee,” the Task Force “conclude[d] . . . that strict scrutiny of the fee agreement [would be] inconsistent with the client-driven litigation model established in the PSLRA.” Instead, it urged district court judges to “presume that the fee is reasonable when it is the result of an agreement between the ‘most adequate’ plaintiff and chosen counsel.” Judges should override this presumption only when the agreed compensation is “clearly excessive,” “has been rendered unfair by unforeseen developments,” or “was not reached by arm’s-length negotiation between the lead plaintiff and counsel.”\n\nThe Task Force issued its proposal on the heels of the Third Circuit’s decision in Cendant. Its recommendation hews closely to the approach endorsed in that case, which also encouraged district court judges to defer to negotiated fee agreements. The Third Circuit also agreed that judges could properly override the presumption when “unusual and unforeseeable changes, i.e., those that could not have been adequately taken into account in the negotiations,” arose and when “the (properly submitted) retained [sic] agreement fee is clearly excessive.” The Court thought it unlikely that “candidates for [the] lead plaintiff designation [would] be deterred by the understanding that their retainer fee arrangement [sic] with Lead Counsel will be subject to judicial review for clear excessiveness.”\n\nClearly, the Task Force’s recommendation is compatible with the holding of Cendant. Both place great weight on ex ante fee agreements between lead plaintiffs and class counsel, and both set out similar grounds for overriding the terms of ex ante agreements on ex post judicial review. But the Task Force did not simply follow the Third Circuit’s jurisprudence down the line. Its recommendation differs from Cendant’s holding in a key respect: The Task Force, but not Cendant, encouraged judges to set preliminary fee terms early in the litigation. The Task Force followed Cendant in recommending deference to fee agreements negotiated ex ante between attorneys and lead plaintiffs but added that judges should set fee terms when appointing class counsel instead of addressing fees for the first time when litigation concludes, as they usually do. Although the Task Force agreed that judges had to review fee awards for reasonableness at the end of litigation, it emphasized that the terms of class counsel’s compensation should be addressed at the appointment stage as well.\n\nThe Task Force is far from the only authority to encourage judges to set preliminary fee terms when appointing class counsel. Successive editions of the Manual for Complex Litigation advise judges to establish ground rules for fee awards and cost reimbursements at this juncture. A series of guides for judges published by the Federal Judicial Center since the 1980s also endorses this approach. Other appellate courts have expressed a preference for ex ante fee agreements in class litigation. Setting attorneys’ fees ex ante was one of the primary motivations for the now-abandoned experiments in some courts to auction the role of class counsel. One can also find a strong hint in this direction in the report a prior Third Circuit Task Force"
