        "text": "1. Motorola, Inc. 2007 Annual Report '07\n\n2. About Motorola We are a global communications leader powered by a passion to invent and an unceasing commitment to advance the way the world connects. Our communication solutions allow people, businesses and governments to be more connected and more mobile. Motorola (NYSE: MOT) has been at the forefront of communication inventions and innovations for nearly 80 years. We have achieved extraordinary accomplishments along the way – such as making the equipment that carried the first words from the moon and leading the cellular communication revolution with the development of the world’s first handheld cellular phone, the DynaTAC. We were the first to bring Push-to-Talk over Cellular to market. More recently, Motorola delivered the first all–digital high–definition television (HDTV) technical standard and demonstrated the world’s first WiMAX 802.16e mobile handoff. Today, Motorola develops a portfolio of technologies, solutions and services – including wireless handsets, wireless accessories, digital entertainment devices, wireless access systems, voice and data communications systems, and enterprise mobility solutions. With the rapid convergence of fixed and mobile broadband Internet and the growing demand for next-generation mobile communication solutions, our mission is to lead the next wave of innovative products that meet the expanding needs of our customers around the world. Our history is rich. Our future is dynamic. We are Motorola and the spirit of invention is what drives us.\n\n3. April 2008 Fellow Shareholder, Motorola has a strong global brand, talented people and a proven record of creating disruptive technologies and innovative products that advance the way the world connects. We help meet the needs of consumers, businesses and governments around the world. As we enter Motorola’s 80th year, my goal as the new CEO is to build on our strong foundation, to renew and strengthen the company and to create increased value for our shareholders. To achieve this, we are committed to growing the value of our businesses, being our customers’ most valued partner, and creating a winning culture focused on execution. Looking ahead, we will continue to implement our strategic plans and pursue opportunities for increased profitability across all of our businesses while never losing sight of our customers, quality and innovation. 2007 Overview During 2007, our Mobile Devices business faced significant challenges. We recognize these challenges and have worked hard to accelerate the business’ recovery. We are committed to improving our operational and financial performance in Mobile Devices and have already taken steps in that direction. While our product portfolio enhancement efforts are underway, they will take more time to complete. During this transition, we will maintain a significant focus on cost, cash and driving profitability improvement. As for Home & Networks Mobility and Enterprise Mobility Solutions, each of these businesses delivered solid results, finished with strong momentum and maintained category leadership positions in growing markets. In Home & Networks Mobility, we are focused on both delivering personalized media experiences to consumers at home and on-the-go and enabling service providers to operate their networks more efficiently and profitably. Our investments in the home enable us to continue capitalizing on strong underlying demand for high-definition and video-on-demand services, as well as the convergence of services and applications across delivery platforms. Our Enterprise Mobility Solutions business delivers exciting new technologies to an expanding mobile workforce and provides an innovative product offering to government and public safety customers. In 2007, we successfully completed the integration of Symbol Technologies, which has enabled us to help our enterprise customers reduce costs, increase worker productivity and enhance their mobility experience. Our mission-critical communications solutions continue to address top-priority homeland security and public safety concerns for customers around the world. Additionally, we remain focused on our environmental footprint and supporting our communities as a responsible corporate citizen. We also encourage employees to volunteer in the community and conducted our second annual global day of service, during which over 11,000 employees gave their time, talent and energy to 300 non-profit organizations in 47 countries. continued –\n\n4. 2008 Outlook On March 26, 2008, we announced the commencement of a process to create two independent, publicly traded companies: one comprised of our Mobile Devices business and the other, Broadband & Mobility Solutions, which includes Motorola’s Enterprise Mobility, Government and Public Safety, and Home and Networks businesses. Creating two industry-leading companies will provide improved flexibility, more tailored capital structures, and increased management focus — as well as more targeted investment opportunities for you, our stockholders. Our management team and Board of Directors, together with independent advisors, have been reviewing opportunities to enhance stockholder value for quite a while. This decision followed our January 31, 2008 announcement to evaluate the structural and strategic realignment of our businesses. Based on current plans, the creation of the two stand-alone businesses is expected to take the form of a tax-free distribution to Motorola’s shareholders, subject to further financial, tax and legal analysis, resulting in shareholders holding shares of two independent and publicly traded companies. We expect that this separation, if consummated, would take place in 2009. I am confident that through the innovation of our people, combined with dedication to our customers and shareholders, we can provide a path for growth and improved profitability and position Motorola for future success. Greg Brown President and Chief Executive Officer Motorola, Inc.\n\n7.

PART I Throughout this 10-K report we “incorporate by reference” certain information in parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC allows us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner. Please refer to such information. We are making forward-looking statements in this report. In “Item 1A: Risk Factors” we discuss some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. “Motorola” (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) means Motorola, Inc. or Motorola, Inc. and its subsidiaries, or one of our segments, as the context requires. “Motorola” is a registered trademark of Motorola, Inc. Item 1: Business General We provide technologies, products and services that make a broad range of mobile experiences possible. Our portfolio includes wireless handsets, wireless accessories, digital entertainment devices, wireless access systems, voice and data communications systems, and enterprise mobility products. With the rapid convergence of fixed and mobile broadband Internet and the growing demand for next-generation mobile communications solutions by people, businesses and governments, we are focused on high-quality, innovative products that meet the expanding needs of our customers around the world. Motorola is a market leader in the following businesses: • The Mobile Devices business designs, manufactures, sells and services wireless handsets with integrated software and accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. • The Home and Networks Mobility business designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) digital video, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and broadcast network interactive set-tops (“digital entertainment devices”), end-to-end video delivery solutions, broadband access infrastructure systems, and associated data and voice customer premise equipment (“broadband gateways”) to cable television and telecom service providers, and (ii) wireless access systems (“wireless networks”), including cellular infrastructure systems and wireless broadband systems, to wireless service providers. • The Enterprise Mobility Solutions business designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and digital two-way radio, voice and data communications products and systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions to a wide range of enterprise markets, including government and public safety agencies, as well as retail, utility, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare and other commercial customers. Motorola is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as the successor to an Illinois corporation organized in 1928. Motorola’s principal executive offices are located at 1303 East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196. Business Segments Motorola reports financial results for the following three operating business segments: Mobile Devices Segment The Mobile Devices segment (“Mobile Devices” or the “segment”) designs, manufactures, sells and services wireless handsets with integrated software and accessory products, and licenses intellectual property. In 2007, the segment’s net sales represented 52% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. 1\n\n10. Principal Products and Services Our wireless subscriber products include wireless handsets with related software and accessory products. We also sell and license our intellectual property. We market our products worldwide to carriers and consumers through direct sales, distributors, dealers, retailers and, in certain markets, through licensees. Our Industry The overall wireless handset industry remains strong. Total industry shipments of wireless handsets (also referred to as industry “sell-in”) increased to approximately 1.14 billion units in 2007, an increase of approximately 16% compared to 2006. Demand from new subscribers was strong in emerging markets, led by India and China. Replacement sales in highly-penetrated markets were also strong due to generally favorable economic conditions, as well as compelling new handset designs, attractive handset features and the increased roll- out of high-speed data networks, all creating greater demand. Industry forecasters predict that the wireless handset industry will continue to grow over the next several years, although the annual rate of growth is expected to be in the 10% range as opposed to the approximately 20% average annual growth the industry experienced from 2003 through 2007. Continued growth is expected to be driven primarily by demand from new subscribers in emerging markets and replacement sales from the current subscriber base. Our Strategy Motorola seeks to be a leading supplier of wireless handsets and mobile experiences to customers globally. To accomplish this objective, our strategy is focused on improving our product portfolio to meet consumer demands and improving our financial performance. This includes transitioning to silicon and software platforms that enable us to lower costs, get to market faster and offer richer consumer experiences. We have structured our mobile device product portfolio and development into four primary product segments: Mass Market, Feature, Multimedia and Productivity. Our strategy is to offer a broad array of products in each of these product segments. The Mass Market product segment focuses on voice-centric devices with targeted features. While this segment is maturing in North America, Europe and parts of Asia, it is growing significantly in developing regions. To address this market, we are expanding our handset offerings around our new W Series of handsets. These handsets satisfy everyday communications needs, include targeted features and are offered at affordable price points across all regions and in both CDMA and GSM technologies. The key to our success in the Mass Market product segment is offering products at competitive price points. The Feature product segment focuses on delivering iconic, fashionable phones with high-end features. During 2007, we refreshed our flagship RAZR franchise with the RAZR2, the luxurious RAZR2 V8, and a RAZR classic with video playback and a digital audio processor music player. We are focused on building an enhanced portfolio of Feature phone devices that deliver compelling 2G and 3G mobile experiences. The Multimedia product segment is focused on the convergence of voice capabilities with multimedia experiences on a single mobile device. In the recent past, many of our customers have purchased and used different devices from multiple consumer electronics segments to meet their lifestyle needs. In addition to mobile phones, they use devices such as cameras, mobile music and video players, mobile gaming devices and portable navigation devices. Increasingly, these experiences will be delivered through compelling applications and services on a single device. We are developing handsets designed to strengthen our Multimedia product offerings, such as the MOTOROKR Z6 and the S9 headset, a 2008 mobile music offering. We are particularly focused on developing a broader offering of 3G products for the Multimedia product segment. The Productivity product segment is growing as workforces around the world continue to demand increasingly robust wireless handsets and consumers want their email “on the go.” In 2007, we expanded our Q franchise across all regions and major technologies with the launch of the GSM Q8 and UMTS Q9h. We are planning to capitalize on new opportunities in this growing product segment. Throughout each of these product segments, we have increased our focus in our accessories portfolio to deliver complete mobile experiences and to complement the features and functionalities of the wireless handsets. 2\n\n11. Additionally, we are expanding our accessory compatibility across all brands of wireless handsets and Bluetooth-enabled devices. We are investing in next-generation technologies, such as WiMAX, HSDPA and Long Term Evolution (“LTE”). We believe a strong intellectual property portfolio is critical to our long-term success and to ensuring that we maintain a favorable strategic position in these technologies. We will continue to identify opportunities to generate licensing revenue from these investments. We also believe that innovation is critical to offering devices that demonstrate unique experiences and value propositions for consumers. As an example, in 2007 we began shipping our flagship RAZR2 devices with Crystal Talk, a proprietary technology that automatically adjusts audio quality based on ambient noise conditions to provide the optimal conversational experience. In application services, we continue to work with third parties to improve upon and develop our services and applications, which will deliver rich experiences to the customer. Motorola is committed to investing in evolving technologies to ensure that we continue to deliver enhanced and differentiated wireless handset experiences to consumers. In January 2008, we announced that we are evaluating alternatives for the structural and strategic realignment of our Mobile Devices business to better equip it to recapture global market leadership and to enhance shareholder value. This may include the separation of the Mobile Devices business from Motorola’s other businesses to permit each to grow and better serve their customers. Customers We continue to focus on strengthening our relationships with our customers. The segment has several large customers worldwide, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the segment’s business. The largest of the segment’s end customers (including sales through distributors) are Sprint Nextel, AT&T, Verizon, China Mobile and America Movil. In 2007, aggregate net sales to these five customers represented approximately 42% of the segment’s net sales. In addition to selling directly to carriers and operators, our Mobile Devices business also sells products through a variety of third-party distributors and retailers, which account for approximately 33% of the segment’s net sales. The largest of these distributors is Brightstar Corporation. The U.S. market continued to be the segment’s largest individual market, accounting for approximately 46% of the segment’s net sales in 2007, compared to approximately 35% of the segment’s net sales in 2006. Approximately 54% of the segment’s net sales in 2007 were to markets outside the U.S., the largest of which were Brazil, China and Mexico. Compared to 2006, the segment experienced sales declines in each of its four major sales regions: Asia, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (“EMEA”), North America and Latin America. Competition The segment believes its overall market share for the full year 2007 was approximately 14%, making it the third-largest worldwide supplier of wireless handsets. The segment experiences intense competition in worldwide markets from numerous global competitors, including some of the world’s largest companies, such as Nokia, Samsung, Sony-Ericsson and LG. In 2007, consolidation in the wireless handset industry slowed compared to previous years, and the five largest vendors together held an aggregate market share of approximately 83%, compared to 84% at the end of 2006. During 2007, regulatory changes in China precipitated a substantial increase in the number of manufacturers producing handsets in that market. The increased competition, primarily in the very low tier of the Mass Market product segment, has impacted shipment volumes in China for global vendors, as local vendors gained market share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Major competitors in the industry are moving to applications and services as key sources of value and are increasing their focus and investments in these areas. In response, Motorola has created a global applications and services team within the Mobile Devices segment to focus on building the applications and services business. General competitive factors in the market for the segment’s products include: design; time-to-market; brand awareness; technology offered; price; product proposition, performance, quality, delivery and warranty; the quality and availability of service; and relationships with key customers. 3\n\n12. Payment Terms The segment’s customers and distributors buy from us regularly with payment terms that are competitive with current industry practices. These terms vary globally and generally range from cash-with-order to 60 days. Extended payment terms beyond 60 days are provided to customers on a limited basis. A customer’s outstanding credit at any point in time is limited to a predetermined amount as established by the Company. Regulatory Matters Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other countries, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services. The growth of the wireless and personal communications industry may be affected if adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use. Industry growth may also be affected by the cost of the new licenses required to use frequencies and any related frequency relocation costs. The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other new technologies, which can be offered without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and our customers. In addition, Mobile WiMAX was recently approved as a global IMT (International Mobile Telecommunications) standard. This action lays the foundation to further expand mobile WiMAX in key bands, making additional spectrum available globally. In January 2008, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) began its auction of 700 MHz band spectrum licenses in the United States. This spectrum can carry large amounts of data across long distances and penetrate walls easier than higher frequencies, enhancing in-building coverage. The open-access conditions are intended to help foster innovation in handsets and applications, however the actual impact of the new licenses is unclear. The open access provision applies to approximately one-third of the U.S. spectrum being auctioned and prevents the licensee from blocking devices or applications that are compatible with the network. Backlog The segment’s backlog was $647 million at December 31, 2007, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2006. This decrease in backlog is primarily due to a decline in customer demand driven by gaps in the segment’s product portfolio. The 2007 backlog is believed to be generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2008. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change. Intellectual Property Matters Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Motorola is also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses. The protection of these licenses is also important to the segment’s operations. Reference is made to the material under the heading “Other Information” for additional information relating to patents and trademarks and research and development activities with respect to this segment. Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory in manufacturing and distribution centers in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2007, the segment had a lower inventory balance than at the end of 2006. The decrease reflects the significant decline in sales volumes during 2007, as well as an ongoing emphasis on managing inventory levels. 4\n\n13. Availability of materials and components required by the segment is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We currently source certain materials and components from single vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Energy necessary for the segment’s manufacturing facilities consists primarily of electricity and natural gas, which are currently in generally adequate supply for the segment’s operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices, which increased significantly during 2007 and increased our manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned items or a significant cost increase could affect the segment’s results. The segment permits returns under limited circumstances to remain competitive with current industry practices. The segment typically experiences higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter and lower sales in the first calendar quarter of each year due to seasonal trends in the wireless handset industry. Our Facilities/Manufacturing Our headquarters is located in Libertyville, Illinois. Our other major facilities are located in Plantation, Florida; Flensburg, Germany; Singapore; Beijing, Hangzhou and Tianjin, China; Jaguariuna, Brazil; Basingstoke, England; and Chennai, India. We have recently announced our intent to exit our Flensburg, Germany facility. We also use several electronics manufacturing suppliers (“EMS”) and original design manufacturers (“ODM”) to enhance our ability to lower our costs and/or deliver products that meet consumer demands in the rapidly- changing technological environment. A portion of our handsets are manufactured either completely or substantially by non-affiliated EMS and ODM manufacturers and the percentage of total manufactured unit volume with these manufacturers increased moderately from 2006 to 2007. In 2007, our handsets were primarily manufactured in Asia and we expect this to continue in 2008. Our largest manufacturing facilities are located in China, Singapore and Brazil. Each of these facilities serves multiple countries and regions of the world. Home and Networks Mobility Segment The Home and Networks Mobility segment (“Home and Networks Mobility” or the “segment”) designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services: (i) digital video, Internet Protocol (“IP”) video and broadcast network interactive set-tops (“digital entertainment devices”), end-to-end video delivery solutions, broadband access infrastructure systems, and associated data and voice customer premise equipment (“broadband gateways”) to cable television and telecom service providers (collectively, referred to as the “home business”), and (ii) wireless access systems (“wireless networks”), including cellular infrastructure systems and wireless broadband systems, to wireless service providers. In 2007, the segment’s net sales represented 27% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Principal Products and Services In the home business, the segment is a leading provider of end-to-end networks used for the delivery of video, data and voice services over hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) networks, digital subscriber line (“DSL”) and passive optical networks (“PON”). Our portfolio includes: MPEG video encoding equipment for standard-definition and high-definition television (“HDTV” or “HD”); video processing and multiplexing systems; and video-on-demand, switched digital video and conditional access solutions used by network operators and programmers to deliver video programming. We provide a broad array of digital entertainment devices supporting analog, digital and IP video delivery including HD and digital video recording (“DVR”) (together, “HD/DVR”) applications. We support the delivery of high-speed data and voice services with head-end and central office equipment, along with data and voice modems and gateways for HFC and DSL networks and optical line terminals for PON networks. In the wireless networks business, the segment provides end-to-end cellular networks, including radio base stations, base station controllers, associated software and services, application platforms and third-party switching for CDMA, GSM, iDEN» and UMTS technologies. The segment also offers a portfolio of WiMAX products to 5\n\n14. create mobile IP broadband access. WiMAX has the potential to make mobile bandwidth more affordable and accessible for mainstream consumer adoption. Our products are marketed primarily to cable television operators, television programmers, telecom operators, wireless service providers and other communications providers worldwide and are sold primarily by our skilled sales personnel. Our Industry The home market is evolving rapidly as cable and telecom network operators expand their video, data and voice services (commonly known as the “triple play”) to grow their subscriber base. The competition between cable and telecom service providers is increasing. Telecom operators are expanding their broadband networks and beginning to offer advanced video and data services using IPTV and PON technologies. Cable operators are responding by expanding their investment in HD programming, bundling voice-over-IP services, expanding their broadband data service through Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications (“DOCSIS”) 3.0 channel bonding, and maximizing utilization of network bandwidth using switched digital video. Our home business is subject to regulation by the FCC in the United States and other governmental communication regulators throughout the world. On July 1, 2007, regulations enacted by the FCC became effective, requiring separation of security functionality from cable set-tops. A full two-way security interface continues to be refined. Once developed and implemented, these changes are expected to increase competition and encourage the sale of set-tops and integrated devices, such as televisions and DVRs, that will allow retail customers direct access to programming. Traditionally, service providers have leased digital entertainment devices to their customers. In the wireless networks market, the majority of installed cellular infrastructure systems are based on CDMA, GSM, UMTS and iDEN technologies. We supply systems based on each of these technologies and are the sole supplier of proprietary iDEN networks. Advanced infrastructure systems based on these technologies include GPRS, CDMA-1X and EDGE. In addition, some segments of the cellular infrastructure industry have installed, or are in the process of migrating to, 3G networks, which are high-capacity radio access wireless networks providing enhanced data services, improved Internet access and increased voice capacity. The primary 3G technologies are W- CDMA (based on either UMTS or Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (“FOMA”) technologies) and CDMA2000 1xEVDO. We supply 3G systems based on UMTS and CDMA 2000 1xEVDO technologies. An additional 3G technology standard is TD-SCDMA, driven primarily by the Chinese government and local Chinese vendors. We expect 3G licenses to be awarded in China during 2008. Industry standards bodies are in the process of defining the next generation of wireless broadband systems after 3G. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”) is currently developing fixed and mobile broadband standards (802.16d and 802.16e) based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (“OFDM”) technology, which will utilize wider channels and enable triple play services (voice, data, video). Based upon developments in the 802.16e standard, we expect to see the WiMAX market begin to develop in 2008 as several WiMAX networks come on-line and devices utilizing these networks become widely available. We are an early leader in next-generation wireless broadband products, including WiMAX technology. The International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) is also adopting next-generation cellular wireless access standards (“4G”) for the cellular infrastructure industry, also based on OFDM technology and known commonly as Long Term Evolution (“LTE”). LTE has widespread industry support, not only from current GSM/UMTS operators, but also from CDMA/EV-DO based carriers. Motorola has been chosen as a trial supplier for a joint Verizon/Vodafone LTE trial that is currently underway. Licensing bodies of governments around the world are making spectrum available for advanced wireless technologies, including 4G, in recognition of growing demand for wireless broadband services. Currently, Motorola estimates that there are over 1,200 licenses available worldwide for advanced wireless technologies, such as 802.16e, with over 800 licenses outside North America. Demand for our products depends primarily on: (i) capital spending by providers of cellular and broadband services for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems, and (ii) the marketing of advanced communications services by those providers. The amount of spending by these providers, and therefore a majority of our sales and profitability, are affected by a variety of factors, including: (i) the continuing trend of consolidation within the cable, wireline and wireless industries, (ii) the financial condition of operators and alternative providers, including their access to financing, (iii) technological developments, (iv) standardization 6\n\n15. efforts that impact the deployment of new equipment, (v) new legislation and regulations affecting the equipment sold by the segment, and (vi) general economic conditions. In 2007, the home business benefited from increased spending by operators on our products due to the increase in video and data subscribers and the deployment of advanced video platforms by cable operators for HD/DVR applications, as well as from spending by telecom operators upgrading their networks and adding video services. We expect this industry to continue to grow in 2008, driven by continued expansion of broadband network capacity and services. In 2007, the overall market for traditional CDMA wireless networks was relatively flat and the overall markets for GSM and iDEN wireless networks were down. Forecasted industry trends point to a decline in the CDMA, GSM and iDEN markets in 2008 as next-generation 3G and WiMAX wireless networks are deployed. Sales in the overall wireless network market are expected to be flat, or up slightly, in 2008. Our Strategy The Home and Networks Mobility segment is focused on leadership in next-generation broadband solutions to accelerate the delivery of personal media experiences. Key elements in the segment’s strategy include: (i) providing for seamless convergence of services and applications across delivery platforms within the home and across wireline and wireless networks, (ii) innovating and optimizing our end-to-end network portfolio, and (iii) developing new services that leverage our platforms to provide revenue-generating applications and services to our operator customers while enabling consumers to experience media mobility. In the home business, we are focused on accelerating the rate of digital penetration by broadband operators in North America through an enhanced suite of digital entertainment devices. These products include basic models supporting the industry movement to all-digital delivery and advanced units supporting HD/DVR functions. We are capitalizing on telecom operators decisions to offer IPTV to their subscribers globally, with products that support delivery of video content using both copper-outside-plant and fiber-to-the-premises (“FTTP”) networks. During the year, the segment continued to provide video infrastructure, FTTP access network equipment and advanced digital entertainment devices for the launch of Verizon’s FiOS service and is supplying IP interactive set- tops to leading telecommunication companies around the world, including AT&T, SingTel and Telia Sonera. We are also enhancing and expanding our voice and data portfolio to offer end-to-end solutions for fixed-mobile convergence and next-generation converged IP-based voice, data and video delivery. These solutions include: (i) broadband gateways with support for handing off a mobile voice or data call to a carrier’s VoIP or data network, and (ii) next-generation infrastructure products enhancing our cable modem termination system (“CMTS”) and PON platforms to expand the bandwidth delivered to a home or business. We developed our first Femtocell gateway in 2007, which enables consumers to connect to a wireless service provider’s network via a DSL or cable broadband connection. We are also an industry leader in broadband infrastructure solutions, introducing DOCSIS 3.0 channel bonding on our CMTS and cable modems and commercially deploying our Gigabit PON platform. In order to enhance our strategy, as well as increase our offerings to wireline carriers, we have completed several strategic acquisitions. During 2007, we completed the acquisition of Netopia, Inc., a broadband equipment provider for DSL customers, which allows for phone, TV and fast Internet connections. We also acquired: (i) Tut Systems, Inc., a leading developer of edge routing and video encoders; (ii) Terayon Communication Systems, Inc., a provider of real-time digital video networking applications to cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers worldwide; (iii) Modulus Video, Inc., a provider of MPEG-4 Advanced Coding compression systems designed for delivery of high-value video content in the IP set-top devices for the digital video, broadcast and satellite marketplaces; and (iv) Leapstone Systems, Inc., a provider of intelligent multimedia service delivery and content management solutions to networks operators. These acquisitions enhance our ability to: (i) provide complete solutions to operators as they deploy advanced services, (ii) assist operators in growing their on-demand content offerings, deploying switched digital video technology, and enabling targeted advertising solutions, and (iii) provide end-to-end video solutions to wireline and wireless operators as they add video to their service offerings. In the wireless networks business, the segment is investing to be a leader in next-generation wireless broadband technologies with its WiMAX solution. Because of its projected quicker time to market, expected lower cost and expected superior performance, the WiMAX wireless broadband technology, which is based on the IEEE standard 802.16e, represents a compelling offering for existing operators and emerging broadband service providers. In 2007, the segment delivered WiMAX network equipment to Wateen Telecom in Pakistan and Sprint Nextel and Clearwire in the United States. In addition, at the end of 2007, the segment was participating in over 7\n\n16. 40 WiMAX trials globally. The segment is also leveraging its WiMAX investment to develop its LTE solution. Vodafone and Verizon have launched a coordinated LTE trial in 2008. Motorola has been selected as a supplier to support this trial with both infrastructure equipment and handsets. Customers The largest of the segment’s customers are Comcast, Verizon, KDDI (a service provider in Japan), China Mobile and Sprint Nextel. In 2007, aggregate net sales to these five customers represented approximately 43% of the segment’s net sales. The loss of any of the segment’s large customers could have a material adverse effect on the segment’s business. Further, because many of these contracts are long-term, the loss of a major customer could impact revenue and earnings over several quarters. Although sales in North America continued to account for a majority of the segment’s sales, 48% of the segment’s net sales in 2007 were outside North America. The segment experienced sales increases in all geographic regions in 2007 compared to 2006. Competition The businesses in which the segment operates are highly competitive. The rapid technological changes occurring in each of the markets in which the segment competes are expected to lead to the entry of many new competitors. Competitive factors in the market for the segment’s products and systems include: technology offered; product and system performance; price; features; quality; delivery and availability. We believe that we are competitively positioned because of our solid relationships with major communication system operators worldwide, our technological leadership and our new product development capabilities. Price is a major area of competition and often impacts margins for initial system bids, particularly in emerging markets. Time-to-market has also been an important competitive factor, especially for new systems and technologies. We compete worldwide in the market for digital entertainment devices for broadband networks. Based on 2007 annual sales, we believe we are the leading provider of digital cable and IPTV set-tops in North America. Our digital cable and IPTV set-tops compete with products from a number of different companies, including: (i) those that develop and sell products that are distributed by direct broadcast satellite service providers through retail channels, (ii) those that develop, manufacture and sell products of their own design, and (iii) those that license technology from us or other competitors. In North America, our largest competitor is Cisco. Other competitors in North America include ARRIS, Ericsson (which entered the market in 2007 via the acquisition of Tandberg) and Harmonic, Inc. Outside of North America, where we have a smaller market position, we compete with many equipment suppliers, including several consumer electronics companies. The traditional competitive environment in the North American cable market continues to evolve. On July 1, 2007, regulations enacted by the FCC became effective requiring separation of security functionality from set-tops. To meet this requirement, we provide security modules to cable operators for use with both our own and third- party set-tops. A full two-way security interface specification continues to be refined. Once developed and implemented, these changes are expected to increase competition and encourage the sale of set-tops and integrated devices, such as televisions and DVRs, that will allow retail customers direct access to programming. Traditionally, cable service providers have leased the set-top to their customers. We also compete worldwide in the market for broadband data and voice products. We believe that we are the leading provider of cable modems worldwide, competing with a number of consumer electronic companies and various original design manufacturers worldwide. In the wireless networks market, there is widespread competition from numerous competitors, ranging from some of the world’s largest diversified companies to foreign, state-owned telecommunications companies to many small, specialized firms. Ericsson is the market leader, followed by the Nokia-Siemens joint venture, Alcatel-Lucent, and two vendors with similar market share, Motorola and Nortel. Huawei, Samsung, NEC and ZTE are also significant competitors. The segment’s wireless networks business is confronting several factors that could impact its business, including price competition, continuing consolidation among competitor telecommunications equipment providers, a decline in our proprietary iDEN business, and vendor financing by competitors as customers continue to look to vendors as an additional source of financing. The market for GSM access systems has become particularly price competitive resulting in significant declines in gross margins in the market for those systems during 2006 and 2007. 8\n\n17. Payment Terms Payment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement. Contracts for wireless networks typically include implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation and system acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on the completion of the milestone. Customer payments are generally due 30 to 60 days from the invoice date, and are typically limited to 90 days in regions outside North America. As required for competitive reasons, extended payment terms are provided to customers from time-to-time on a limited basis. The segment’s payment terms are consistent with industry practice as many of our contracts are awarded through a competitive bid process. Regulatory Matters Many of our products are subject to regulation by the FCC in the United States and other communications regulatory agencies around the world. In addition, our customers, and their networks into which our products are incorporated, are subject to government regulation. Government regulatory policies affecting either the willingness or the ability of cable and telecom operators, wireless operators and wireline operators to offer certain services, or the terms on which these operators offer the services and conduct their business, may have a material adverse affect on the segment’s results. Motorola has developed products using trunking and data communications technologies to enhance spectral efficiencies. The growth and results of the wireless communications industry may be affected by regulations relating to the access to allocated spectrum for wireless communications users, especially in urban areas where spectrum is heavily used. Historically, reception of digital television programming from a cable broadband network has required a set- top with security technology. This security technology has limited the availability of set-tops to those manufactured by a few cable network manufacturers, including Motorola. FCC regulations requiring separation of security functionality from set-tops that are aimed at increasing competition and encouraging the sale of set-tops in the retail market became effective for most customers on July 1, 2007. Traditionally, cable service providers sold or leased their set-top to their customer. As the retail market develops for set-tops and televisions capable of accepting the security modules, sales of our set-tops may be negatively impacted. The U.S. leads the world in spectrum deregulation, allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale. Examples include wireless local area network systems, such as WiFi, and wide area network systems, such as WiMAX and LTE. Other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other technologies which can be offered without spectrum license costs. Deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities for Motorola and our customers. As more fully described under “Enterprise Mobility Solutions — Regulatory Matters” beginning on page 13 of this Form 10-K, as television transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries around the world are examining, and in some cases already pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television spectrum. Certain segments of the spectrum that have historically been utilized for analog television have now been designated to support new commercial communications systems and, therefore, are expected to generate new business opportunities for Motorola in wireless and video technologies. In the U.S., the FCC has begun the auction of spectrum in the 700 MHz band that will be reclaimed by the government in February 2009. License for this spectrum may be used for flexible fixed, mobile and broadcast applications. Although the auction winners will determine the best utilization of the acquired spectrum, both LTE and WiMAX are candidates for technology selection. In addition, a contiguous portion of this spectrum has generated interest for mobile TV applications. Backlog The segment’s backlog was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2006. The 2007 order backlog is believed to be generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2008. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change. 9\n\n18. Intellectual Property Matters Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its products, systems, technologies and manufacturing processes. The segment seeks to build upon our core enabling technologies, such as digital compression, encryption and conditional access systems, and wireless air-interface technology in order to lead worldwide growth in the market for wired and wireless communications networks. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, and will periodically seek to include our proprietary technologies in certain patent pools that support the implementation of standards. We are a founder of MPEG LA, the patent licensing authority established to foster broad deployment of MPEG-2 compliant systems. In addition, we have licensed our digital conditional access technology, DigiCipher» II, to other equipment suppliers and have formed joint ventures with Comcast for development and licensing of conditional access technology. We also enter into other license agreements, both as licensor and licensee, covering certain products and processes with various companies. These license agreements require the payment of certain royalties that are not expected to be material to the segment’s financial results. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses. Reference is made to the material under the heading “Other Information” for information relating to patents and trademarks and research and development activities with respect to this segment. Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards. At the end of 2007, the segment had lower inventory balances than at the end of 2006, primarily due to the completion of significant project milestones and the sale of the embedded communications computing business. Availability of materials and components required by the segment is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We currently source certain materials and components from single vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Natural gas, electricity, and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy required for our manufacturing operations, which are currently in generally adequate supply for the segments operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices, which increased significantly during 2007 and increased our manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned items or a significant cost increase could affect the segment’s results. Generally, we do not permit customers to return products, other than under standard warranty provisions. The segment has not experienced seasonal buying patterns for its products. Our Facilities/Manufacturing Our headquarters is located in Horsham, Pennsylvania. Major design, integration, manufacturing and distribution centers are located in: Arlington Heights and Schaumburg, Illinois; Chandler, Arizona; Fort Worth, Texas; Taipei, Taiwan; Nogales, Mexico; Bangalore, India; Swindon, England; Hangzhou and Tianjin, China; and Penang, Malaysia. In addition to our own manufacturing, we utilize non-affiliated electronics manufacturing suppliers and original design manufacturers, primarily in Asia, in order to enhance our ability to lower costs and/ or deliver products that meet consumer demands. Enterprise Mobility Solutions Segment The Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment (“Enterprise Mobility Solutions” or the “segment”) designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services analog and digital two-way radio, voice and data communications products and systems for private networks, wireless broadband systems and end-to-end enterprise mobility 10\n\n19. solutions to a wide range of enterprise markets, including government and public safety agencies (which, together with all sales to distributors of two-way communication products, is referred to as the “government and public safety market”), as well as retail, utility, transportation, manufacturing, healthcare and other commercial customers (which, collectively, are referred to as the “commercial enterprise market”). In 2007, the segment’s net sales represented 21% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Our products include advanced data capture products, mobile computing platforms and software management tools, wireless infrastructure, and radio frequency identification (“RFID”) infrastructure and tags, and are sold as both integrated solutions and individual devices. The segment’s products are sold through Motorola’s direct sales force and through independent and authorized distributors, dealers and value-added resellers, original equipment manufacturers, service operators and independent commission sales representatives. Distributors and value-added resellers may provide a service or add components in order to resell our product to end users. The segment’s distribution organization provides systems engineering and installation and other technical and systems management services to meet its customers’ particular needs. The customer may also choose to install and maintain the equipment with its own employees, or may obtain installation, service and parts from a network of the segment’s authorized service stations or from other non-Motorola service stations. Our Industry We compete in the mobile segment of the communications industry, providing wireless equipment infrastructure and services to public safety, government and enterprise customers. Within our government and public safety market, interoperability and natural disaster preparedness continue to be important issues for our customers worldwide. We expect this industry to grow in the mid-to-high single digit percentage range in 2008, consistent with previous years. Our extensive portfolio of products includes advanced solutions for each of the major standards-based private network technologies, APCO 25 (Association for Public Safety Communications Officials) and TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio), as well as biometrics and wireless broadband applications. We expect sales to continue to grow worldwide as demand for integrated, interoperable public safety communications increases. As new and better spectrum utilization evolves, we expect to see more demand and greater potential for data applications, such as video surveillance and other data-based products, in 2008 and beyond. Within our commercial enterprise market, we believe there is a significant growth opportunity as the global workforce continues to become more mobile and the industries and markets that purchase our products continue to expand. The markets in which Motorola competes include enterprise wireless infrastructure, mobile computing solutions, bar code scanning, RFID solutions and mobile network management platforms. Organizations looking to increase productivity and derive benefits from mobilizing their applications and workforces are driving growth in this market, which we expect to be in the high single digits in 2008. With the acquisition of Symbol Technologies, Inc. (“Symbol”) in January 2007, Motorola is well positioned to compete effectively in the enterprise space. Our Strategy Motorola has been a leading provider of mission-critical systems in the government and public safety market worldwide for more than 65 years. The acquisition of Symbol is the cornerstone of the segment’s strategy to expand its leadership into the commercial enterprise market. We are using our combined scale to maintain and expand our leadership position in these markets worldwide by uniting the two companies’ adjacent assets, intellectual property, customer and supplier bases, and industry-leading products. The combination of our direct sales and indirect channel partners provides significant distribution advantages in each of the markets we serve. 11\n\n20. In the government and public safety market, our objective is to maintain our leading position as the market and technology evolves. Key strategies include: (i) continuing investment in our analog radio portfolio while leading the ongoing migration to digital products, (ii) leveraging our wireless broadband portfolio to drive growth and enter new markets, (iii) managing the anticipated public/private convergence planned for potential 700MHz public safety systems in the U.S., and (iv) continuing to lead the market for APCO 25 and TETRA standards-based voice and data networking systems around the world. In the commercial enterprise market, our strategy is to deliver products and solutions that are designed to increase cost effectiveness, enhance efficiency and promote faster execution of critical business processes. Key strategies include offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to help businesses: (i) streamline their supply chains, (ii) improve customer service in the field, (iii) increase data collection accuracy, and (iv) enhance worker productivity. Customers Our products and services are sold worldwide to a diverse set of customers, including government and public safety agencies (police, fire, and emergency management services) and militaries, as well as retail, utility, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, wholesale and distribution, healthcare and other commercial customers. Our sales model emphasizes both direct sales by our in-house sales force and indirect sales through our channel of value-added resellers and distributors. We believe this dual sales approach allows us to meet customer needs effectively, build strong, lasting relationships and broaden our penetration across various markets. Our channel sales force allows us to increase revenues by extending the reach of our products and solutions to meet demand in market segments where our direct sales force does not sell. Resellers and distributors each have their own sales organizations which complement and extend our sales organization. With deep expertise about specific customers’ operations, resellers can be very effective in promoting sales of Motorola products. We believe this tiered distribution approach will allow us to achieve our goal of maintaining gross margin over time, as we drive greater scale from shipping more efficiently through better management of our supply chain. The largest of the segment’s customers are the U.S. Government, Scansource, IBM, Ingram Micro and Wal-Mart. In 2007, aggregate net sales to these five customers represented approximately 19% of the segment’s net sales. The loss of any of the segment’s largest customers may have a material adverse effect on the segment’s business. Further, because some of these contracts are long-term, the loss of a major customer could impact revenue and earnings over several quarters. Net sales to customers in North America represented 62% of the segment’s net sales in 2007. A majority of our sales were made directly through our in-house sales force. However, as noted above, a significant portion of our sales are made through resellers and distributors. Our largest resellers and distributors are Scansource, IBM and Ingram Micro, which primarily sell to the commercial enterprise market. Competition The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. Continued evolution in the industry, as well as technological migration, is opening up the market to increased competition. Other key competitive factors include: technology offered; price; payment terms; availability of vendor financing; product and system performance; product features, quality, delivery, availability and warranty; the quality and availability of service; company image; relationship with key customers; and time-to-market. We believe we are uniquely positioned in the industry due to our strong customer relationships, our technological leadership and capabilities, and our range of offerings. The segment experiences widespread competition in the government and public safety market from a growing number of new and existing competitors. In this market, the segment provides communications and information systems compliant with both existing industry digital standards, APCO 25 and TETRA. Major competitors include: M/A-Com, EADS Telecommunications, Kenwood, EF Johnson, Cisco and large system integrators. Competitors in this segment may also serve as a subcontractor to a large system integrator and are selected based on a number of competitive factors and customer requirements. The segment is managing the impact of system integrators seeking to move further into the public safety area, specifically in the federal government market. Several other competitive factors may have an impact on the business, including: the consolidation among telecommunications equipment providers; evolving developments in the 700 MHz band, and increasing encroachment by broadband and IP solution providers. As demand for fully-integrated voice, data and broadband systems continues, the segment may face additional competition from public telecommunications carriers. 12\n\n21. The commercial enterprise market is highly competitive and acutely influenced by advances in technology, industry standards, product improvements, new product introductions and price competition. Many firms are engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of products in bar code reading equipment, wireless networks and mobile computing devices. Numerous companies, including present manufacturers of scanners, lasers, optical instruments, microprocessors, wireless networks, notebook computers, handheld devices and telephonic and other communication devices, have the technical potential to compete with the segment. Competitors such as Intermec, Cisco and Nokia deliver products in certain parts of the commercial enterprise market. Payment Terms Payment terms vary worldwide. Generally, contract payment terms range from 30 to 60 days from the invoice date within North America and are typically limited to 90 days in regions outside North America. A portion of the contracts in the government and public safety market include implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation and system acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on the completion of the milestone. We generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required for competitive reasons, we may provide or work with third-party lenders to arrange for long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase price. Regulatory Matters The use of wireless voice, data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum, which is regulated by governmental agencies throughout the world. In the U.S., the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities, respectively. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”). Consequently, the business and results of this segment could be affected by the rules and regulations adopted by the FCC, NTIA or regulatory agencies in other countries from time to time. The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. The segment manufactures and markets products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. These include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios and portable or handheld units. Our products span the public safety, enterprise, commercial and consumer markets and operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum. In addition, new spectrum bands and modified regulations provide possible opportunities for new business. As television transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries around the world are examining, and in some cases already pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television spectrum. In the U.S., pursuant to federal legislation, analog television stations must cease operation in the broadcast television spectrum by February 17, 2009. The soon-to-be available spectrum that has historically been utilized for analog television (the so-called “digital dividend” spectrum) can provide new opportunities for Motorola and for our competitors. In parallel, 108 MHz of spectrum historically used for broadcast television is being redeveloped for new uses, including broadband and narrowband wireless communications. Under rules adopted by the FCC, this portion of the spectrum under redevelopment (the 700 MHz band) will support new commercial and public safety communications systems. As of February 2008, approximately 40 public safety customers are already implementing narrowband 700 MHz systems in areas where television incumbency is not an issue. Additional agencies are expected to deploy systems as broadcast television is cleared from the 700 MHz band. The FCC also has made provisions for a 700 MHz band nationwide public safety broadband network to be built over the next 10 years. In addition, segments of the spectrum are being auctioned for commercial use and Motorola could see new business opportunities as auction winners implement broadband systems on that spectrum. Internationally, the ITU World Radio Conference held in Geneva in November 2007 identified spectrum that could be made available as part of a “digital dividend” as television transitions from analog to digital technology globally. Countries around the world are studying the potential size, timing and use of this potentially available spectrum. In November 2007, the European Commission issued a statement promoting a common European approach to its use. The United Kingdom has already decided to redevelop spectrum as a result of the digital 13\n\n22. transition and is making available 112 MHz of spectrum through auctions. Canada recently released a consultation requesting industry input on making additional spectrum available for public safety use in the 700 MHz band. A number of other countries around the world have also indicated their intention to pursue the availability of digital dividend spectrum. A global focus on enhancing security and “connecting the unconnected” is providing new opportunities for Motorola’s wireless broadband and RFID products. In addition to offering products that operate in licensed broadband, Motorola offers wireless broadband solutions that operate in bands where no license is required, providing an economical means for enhancing connectivity in developing countries. Government funding to enhance connectivity in African countries is fueling new opportunities for these products. Likewise, interest in strengthening border security and global tracking and security of products provides greater opportunities for Motorola’s RFID products. In addition, some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. Backlog The segment’s backlog was $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2007, compared to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2006. The 2007 order backlog is believed to be generally firm and approximately 74% of that amount is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2008. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change. Intellectual Property Matters Patent protection is extremely important to the segment’s operations. The segment has an extensive U.S. and international portfolio of patents relating to its products, systems, technologies and manufacturing processes, including recent research developments in scanning, information collection, network communications and network management. We have also filed additional patent applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as in foreign patent offices. The segment licenses some of its patents to third parties and this revenue is not significant. Motorola is also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses. We actively participate in the development of open standards for interoperable, mission-critical digital two- way radio systems. We have published our technology and licensed patents to signatories of the industry’s two primary memorandums of understanding defined by the Telecommunications Industry Association (“TIA”) Project 25 and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (“ETSI”) Terrestrial Trunked Radio (“TETRA”). Notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents and the resulting potential for increased competition for certain of our products in the future, we believe that our extensive patent portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we believe we are not dependent upon a single patent, or a few patents. Our success depends more upon our proprietary know-how, innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities. In addition, because of changing technology, our present intention is not to rely primarily on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position. However, the segment continues to litigate against competitors to enforce its intellectual property rights in certain technologies and is currently involved in several such lawsuits. Reference is made to the material under the heading “Other Information” for information relating to patents and trademarks and research and development activities with respect to this segment. Inventory, Raw Materials, Right of Return and Seasonality The segment’s practice is to carry reasonable amounts of inventory to meet customers’ delivery requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards. The segment provides custom products which requires the stocking of inventories and large varieties of piece parts and replacement parts in order to meet delivery and warranty requirements. To the extent suppliers’ product life cycles are shorter than the segment’s, stocking of lifetime buy 14\n\n23. inventories is required to meet long-term warranty and contractual requirements. In addition, replacement parts are stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle. At the end of 2007, the segment had a higher inventory balance than at the end of 2006, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Symbol during 2007. Availability of materials and components required by the segment is relatively dependable, but fluctuations in supply and market demand could cause selective shortages and affect results. We currently source certain materials and components from single vendors. Any material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Natural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy for the segment’s operations, which are currently in generally adequate supply for the segment’s operations. In addition, the cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices, which increased significantly during 2007 and increased our manufacturing and shipping costs. Labor is generally available in reasonable proximity to the segment’s manufacturing facilities. However, difficulties in obtaining any of these items or a significant cost increase could affect the segment’s results. Generally, the segment’s contracts do not include a right of return, other than for standard warranty provisions. For new product introductions in our government and public safety market, we may enter into milestone contracts providing that the product could be returned if we do not achieve the milestones. Due to buying patterns in the markets we serve, sales tend to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter. Our Facilities/Manufacturing Our primary offices are located in Schaumburg, Illinois and Holtsville, New York. Major design, integration, manufacturing and distribution centers are located in: Holtsville, New York; Schaumburg, Illinois; Basingstoke, England; Arad, Israel; Tianjin, China; Taunusstein and Berlin, Germany; Reynosa, Mexico; McAllen, Texas; Brno, Czech Republic; and Penang, Malaysia. In addition to our own manufacturing, we utilize non-affiliated electronics manufacturing suppliers, primarily in Asia, in order to enhance our ability to lower costs and deliver products that meet consumer demands. Other Information 2007 Change in Organizational Structure. Effective as of the second quarter of 2007, the Company realigned its operating business segments into the following: (i) Mobile Devices, (ii) Home and Networks Mobility, and (iii) Enterprise Mobility Solutions. Financial Information About Segments. The response to this section of Item 1 incorporates by reference Note 11, “Information by Segment and Geographic Region,” of Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this document. Customers. Motorola has several large customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Motorola’s largest end customers (including sales through distributors) are Sprint Nextel, Verizon, China Mobile, AT&T and America Movil. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2007. Approximately 2% of Motorola’s net sales in 2007 were to various branches and agencies, including the armed services, of the U.S. Government. All contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the Government. Government contractors, including Motorola, are routinely subjected to numerous audits and investigations, which may be either civil or criminal in nature. The consequences of these audits and investigations may include administrative action to suspend business dealings with the contractor and to exclude it from receiving new business. In addition, Motorola, like other contractors, reviews aspects of its government contracting operations, and, where appropriate, takes corrective actions and makes voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Government. These audits and investigations could adversely affect Motorola’s ability to obtain new business from the U.S. Government. 15\n\n24. Backlog. Motorola’s aggregate backlog position for all Motorola segments, as of the end of the last two fiscal years was approximately as follows: December 31, 2007. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $5.5 billion December 31, 2006. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $6.6 billion Except as previously discussed in this Item 1, the orders supporting the 2007 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table are believed to be generally firm, and approximately 89% of the backlog on hand at December 31, 2007 is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2008. The forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change. Research and Development. Motorola’s business segments participate in very competitive industries with constant changes in technology. Throughout its history, Motorola has relied, and continues to rely, primarily on its research and development (“R&D”) programs for the development of new products, and on its production engineering capabilities for the improvement of existing products. Technical data and product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola’s business segments on a regular basis. Management believes, looking forward, that Motorola’s commitment to R&D programs should allow each of its segments to remain competitive. R&D expenditures relating to new product development or product improvement were $4.4 billion in 2007, compared to $4.1 billion in 2006 and $3.6 billion in 2005. R&D expenditures increased 8% in 2007 as compared to 2006, after increasing 14% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Motorola continues to believe that a strong commitment to research and development is required to drive long-term growth. Approximately 27,000 professional employees were engaged in such R&D activities during 2007. Patents and Trademarks. Motorola seeks to obtain patents and trademarks to protect our proprietary position whenever possible and practical. As of December 31, 2007, Motorola, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries owned approximately 10,064 utility and design patents in the U.S. and 12,914 patents in foreign countries. These foreign patents are mostly counterparts of Motorola’s U.S. patents, but a number result from research conducted outside the U.S. and are originally filed in the country of origin. During 2007, Motorola, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries were granted 696 U.S. utility and design patents. Many of the patents owned by Motorola are used in its operations or licensed for use by others, and Motorola is licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to licenses. Environmental Quality. Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has no material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of Motorola. Employees. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, there were approximately 66,000 employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries. Financial Information About Geographic Areas.
