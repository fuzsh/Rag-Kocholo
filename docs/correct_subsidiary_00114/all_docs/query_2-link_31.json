        "text": "3.3. The parties shall develop a mutually agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA) within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement Such SLA shall define expected performance levels and establish a framework for communication between the parties and shall be fully incorporated herein by this reference. In the event of any conflict between any provision of this Agreement and any provision in the SLA, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail. 5.1. Harmonic shall provide Plexus on a monthly basis, a twelve (12) month rolling forecast that assumes three (3) months of demand arc covered by Orders issued by Harmonic. Such forecasts are to be used by Plexus for planning purposes and do not constitute any obligation by Harmonic to purchase Products, as the forecasts are estimates based on marketing data, which may be inaccurate and subject to change according to actual market demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Plexus may make component purchases based on Harmonics forecast with Harmonics prior written authorization. 6.1. Harmonic may place Orders with Plexus on an as needed basis and such Orders shall become effective upon acceptance of the Order by Plexus. Orders shall specify the quantities, prices, revisions, delivery schedules, products, Specifications, and other applicable information necessary for the transaction. Plexus shall acknowledge the Orders within two (2) business days of receipt by facsimile, confirmed email, or mail, provided that the Orders are within the forecast and flexibility parameters set forth in Exhibit C. Such acknowledgements will include verified delivery dates and confirmation of any other applicable Order information requested by Harmonic. If Plexus has any issues with, or requested modifications to, a Harmonic Order, Plexus and Harmonic will work together in good faith to resolve such issues expeditiously and with as little impact to the fulfillment of the Order as possible. This Agreement becomes the exclusive and binding agreement between the parties for the purchase of Products and/or Services when an Order is accepted by acknowledgement and/or commencement of performance by Plexus. Acceptance of an Order is limited to these terms and conditions and each party expressly rejects any other terms, conditions or provisions, on either partys standard forms, including but not limited to, invoices, acknowledgments, and purchase orders, unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties. 7.1. Except as otherwise provided herein, all shipments of Products hereunder shall be made, and Products shall be deemed delivered, FCA Boise Idaho (INCOTERMS 2000), at which point title to Product(s) and risk of loss pass to Harmonic. In the case of shipments of finished Products from Plexus Malaysia facilities to Harmonic facilities in Sunnyvale, California shipments shall be made, and Products shall be deemed delivered, DDP destination (INCOTERMS 2000) at which point risk of loss to the Product will pass to Harmonic (title with respect to such shipments will pass, however, to Harmonic at the time of shipment by Plexus). Any finished Products from Malaysia for which Harmonic requests Plexus to ship to destinations other than Harmonic Sunnyvale, California, shipments shall be made, and Products shall be deemed delivered, FCA point of origin (1NCOTERMS 2000), at which point title to Products and risk of loss pass to Harmonic. 7.2. If Plexus has held finished Product manufactured in accordance with this Agreement in Plexus inventory for more than thirty (30) days, Plexus may, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing, invoice Harmonic for such Product but will hold Product within its facilities pending further shipment instructions from Harmonic (Fulfillment Inventory). Plexus will invoice for such Fulfillment Inventory upon the same being placed in Harmonics Finished Goods inventory location at Plexus, at which time title and risk of loss to such inventory shall also pass to Harmonic. Plexus will, however, insure such Fulfillment Inventory held in Plexus facilities at the full replacement cost thereof under the terms and conditions of Plexus all risk insurance coverage. The prices for the Fulfillment Inventory shall be the prices set forth in those Harmonic Orders under which Plexus manufactured such inventory. Harmonic has requested that Plexus hold such Product following invoicing in order to provide an inventory management and distribution service to Harmonic. If Plexus holds Product for more than (90) days after title to the same has transferred to Harmonic, Plexus will notify Harmonic and ship the Product to Harmonic or its designated agents, unless otherwise agreed in writing. 8.1. All Products shall be packaged appropriately for the method of transportation and in accordance with the Specifications. All Products shall be shipped in accordance with written shipping instructions provided by Harmonic, or if no such instructions are provided, by best route and mode of transportation. Plexus shall be liable for any cost, loss, damage, liability or excess shipping costs resulting from routing differing from Harmonics instructions. Unless otherwise specified on the Order, for any shipments subject to FCA terms as specified in Section 7.1, Plexus shall prepay and add to invoice the cost of freight and any taxes, VAT, duties, customs, or other charges or fees assessed by any government applicable to the transaction, that would apply to the requested destination. 10.1. Harmonic shall review the overall performance of Plexus on a quarterly basis based on review criteria agreed to by both parties, in the form of a Quarterly Business Review (QBR). The process shall involve measuring performance against targets in the areas of quality, delivery, lead-time, customer service, price, cost reduction, productivity and technology. The intent of this review is to maintain leading levels of competitiveness and to track the progress toward meeting the above-mentioned targets and, when needed, implement innovative processes to help achieve those targets. The process is meant to be one that is forward-looking and constructive and the result is to mutually benefit both parties. Additionally, Harmonic may request weekly and monthly meetings or conference calls to review Plexus performance and address any relevant issues. 12.1. All payments hereunder by Harmonic to Plexus shall be made in US dollars net [*] ([*]) days from the date of receipt of an accurate invoice, which shall be no sooner than the date of delivery of the Products to Harmonics designated location. Plexus may submit invoices to Harmonic electronically, via fax or US mail. Payment of invoices shall not constitute acceptance of Products or Services and shall be subject to lawful adjustments and offset for failure of Plexus to meet the requirements of this Agreement. 13.6. Should Harmonic experience a trend of Product defects upon their arrival or during their normal operational use, and the root causes have been identified to be due to Plexus workmanship or component suppliers, -Harmonic may issue a corrective action request to Plexus for corrective actions. Plexus shall investigate and provide its preliminary response within five business days and final response in ten business days with both short term and long term resolutions. 14.1. Harmonic reserves the right at any time to request that Plexus incorporate engineering changes (an ECN) in the specifications, drawings or other descriptions to which the Products are to conform, subject to an equitable and agreeable adjustment in price and/or time of performance and acceptance by Plexus of such changes. This notification will include documentation of the change to effectively support Plexuss investigation of the impact of the engineering change. Plexus will use commercially reasonable efforts to review the changes and report any issues to Harmonic within three (3) business days after receipt of the proposed ECN from Harmonic. If any such change affects the price, delivery, or quality performance of said Product, Harmonic and Plexus will mutually review all issues raised by the ECN and agree in writing to specific resolutions prior to ECN implementation. 16.1. From time to time, Harmonic may supply Plexus with or pay Plexus for certain material, components, inspection tools, inventory or test equipment to be used solely for the manufacturing and testing of Products (Consigned Material). Title to and right of immediate possession of Consigned Material shall be and remain in Harmonic at all times and shall be returned to Harmonic upon request in good and serviceable condition (fair wear and tear excepted). Harmonic reserves the right to remove Consigned Material from Plexus site upon reasonable notice. Plexus shall bear all risk of loss or damage to Consigned Material. In the event Consigned Material is lost stolen, damaged, or made unfit for use, Plexus shall immediately, at Harmonics option, either replace such materials at its own expense or credit Harmonic for the actual purchase price of such Consigned Materials. Any Consigned Material issued to Plexus by Harmonic free of charge for incorporation into the Products shall be subject to the provisions of Section 16.2. 16.2. Insurance for Consigned Material and Equipment. Upon request, Harmonic shall provide an estimate of the dollar value of Consigned Material issued to Plexus and Plexus shall at all times during the term of this Agreement carry and maintain, at its expense, physical damage insurance providing all risks coverage for Consigned Materials. Such insurance shall be with insurance companies of recognized responsibility and shall contain endorsements (a) naming Harmonic (or its successor or assignee, if requested by Harmonic) as loss payee for physical damage insurance, and (b) providing thirty (30) days prior written notice to Harmonic before coverage lapses or is canceled or materially changed. 16.3. Plexus shall use the Consigned Material in a skillful and proper manner and comply with all instructions given to Plexus by Harmonic regarding the care and use of the Consigned Material and shall not use the Consigned Materials for purposes other than the execution of the Orders. Plexus shall undertake not to modify, adjust or alter in any way the Consigned Material without Harmonics prior written consent or to remove any marks identifying any article as Consigned Material or Harmonic property. 17.1. Plexus warrants that it has the right to use any manufacturing process used by Plexus in connection with the manufacture of Product, other than manufacturing processes required by Harmonics Specifications or developed by Harmonic, without creating any obligation on the part of Harmonic to pay any fee, license, penalty or other expense in connection with Harmonics use, reproduction, marketing, licensing or sale of the Work Product or Products, other than the payments to Plexus as set forth herein. 19.1. Deliverables of any and all Work Product shall be promptly disclosed to Harmonic and shall become and remain the sole and exclusive property of Harmonic. Plexus hereby irrevocably transfers and assigns to Harmonic all right, title and interest in the Work Product, including all rights in any patents, copyright, trade secrets, inventions, copyrightable materials, or other intellectual property rights relating to the Work Product. Plexus agrees to execute any documents, including patent and copyright assignments, take any acts and otherwise cooperate with Harmonic, at Harmonics expense (including the reasonable time incurred by Plexus employees at their actual hourly wage rate) but without further compensation to Plexus, in any action Harmonic deems necessary to secure fully to Harmonic all rights in the Work Product or to obtain, register, maintain or defend for Harmonics benefit any or all of the intellectual property rights identified above. Harmonic shall have, at all times, all rights, title and interest in and to all intellectual property including copyrights related to the Work Product. This shall include any Work Product with Plexus. Plexus hereby assign all rights, titles, and interest to any copyrighted Work Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Plexus shall own all intellectual property rights in and to any manufacturing process technology developed by Plexus in connection with the manufacture of Product for Harmonic (Plexus IP). Plexus hereby grants Harmonic a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, non- exclusive, non-transferable license to the Plexus IP to use, make, have made, and sell the Product. 20.1. The parties hereby acknowledge that in the course of performance of this Agreement, it will obtain information, including but not limited to, technical and/or business information describing or related to development or manufacturing activities of the other party and its products which is a confidential and proprietary in nature (Proprietary Information). At all times during the term of this Agreement, each party shall hold Proprietary Information in strict confidence and shall not disclose such Proprietary Information to any third party without the 20.6. This Agreement is intended to secure to Harmonic Plexuss assistance and cooperation. During the term of this Agreement, Plexus shall maintain sufficient separation between teams of its employees, agents, or contractors who may be working for competitors of Harmonic to avoid any conflict of interest. Upon request, Plexus shall demonstrate the adequacy of its precautions to avoid such conflict of interest. If Harmonic determines at any time during the term of this Agreement that such a conflict exists, notwithstanding the adequacy of such precautions taken by Plexus, Harmonic may cancel this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 23 below. Plexus further agrees that it shall not engage directly or indirectly either for itself, or with or for any other person or entity in any work or undertaking which shall create any legal impediment against Plexus performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the rights granted to Harmonic hereunder. 23.1. If either party materially fails to meet any of the terms and conditions as stated in either this Agreement or the addenda, Plexus and Harmonic agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve such default. If the defaulting party fails to cure such default or submit an acceptable written plan to resolve such default within thirty (30) days following notice of default, the non-defaulting party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by furnishing the defaulting party with ninety (90) days written notice of termination. 23.2. This Agreement shall terminate upon written notice should either party; (i) enter into or file a petition, arraignment or proceeding seeking an order for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws of its respective jurisdiction and such petition, arraignment or proceeding is not dismissed within sixty (60) days; (ii) enter into a receivership of any of its assets; or (iii) enter into a dissolution or liquidation of its assets or an assignment for the benefit of its creditors and the same remains undischarged for a period sixty (60) days. 23.5. In the event of termination of this Agreement for any reason, at Harmonics option, Plexus shall support Harmonic with Products sufficient to cover all Harmonic Orders in place at the time of the termination notice and as may be issued by Harmonic and fulfilled by Plexus prior to the termination date. As of the termination date, Plexus shall stop work immediately on all affected Orders and deliver or destroy, at Harmonics option, all copies of all materials containing any Proprietary Materials. In addition, Plexus shall deliver to Harmonic all other Harmonic Consigned Material, confidential information and other materials in its possession. Harmonic shall be obligated for all completed products, work-in-progress, all component material purchased by Plexus in support of Harmonics Orders, all long lead-time material purchased by Plexus to support Harmonics Orders, all non- cancelable/non-returnable inventory, all minimum buy quantities of inventory, and any other such items resulting from Services provided herein. 24.2. It is the intent of the parties that any dispute be resolved informally and promptly through good faith negotiation between Plexus and Harmonic. Either party may initiate negotiation proceedings by written notice to the other party setting forth the particulars of the dispute. The parties agree to meet in good faith to jointly define the scope and a method to remedy the dispute. If these proceedings are not productive of a resolution within thirty (30) days, then the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration as set forth below 24.3. Any controversy of claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved informally as set forth above, shall be settled by arbitration before three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) then in effect, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Within 15 days after the commencement of arbitration, each party shall select one person to act as arbitrator and the two selected shall select a third arbitrator within ten (10) days of their appointment. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. The place of arbitration shall be San Jose, California. Either party, before or during any arbitration, may apply to a court having jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction where such (i) include Harmonic as an Additional Insured, provided that Harmonics rights as an Additional Insured will extend only to liabilities specifically assumed by Plexus under this Agreement and Harmonic will not pursue insurance claims directly with Plexus insurance carrier unless (a) Harmonic has requested that Plexus file a claim (for which Plexus is liable under this Agreement) with its insurance carrier and Plexus has failed to do so within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, or (b) Plexus has ceased to do business or Harmonic has the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 23.2. Plexus insurance carrier shall have the right to deny any claim submitted by Harmonic if not in conformity with the above; 29.1. Assignment. Neither party shall delegate, assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether in whole or part, without the written consent of the other party which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided, however, either party may assign this Agreement to a third party in connection with a merger transaction or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets. 29.2. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, fires, floods, earthquakes, riots, wars or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the delayed party provided that the delayed party: (i) gives the other party prompt written notice of such cause; and (ii) uses reasonable commercial efforts to remedy such delay in its performance. In the event that Plexus fails to deliver Products to Harmonic due to such causes and fails to provide a plan for remedy which is reasonably acceptable to Harmonic, Harmonic may suspend this Agreement in whole or in part for the duration of such delaying cause and, at its option, buy the Products from another source and deduct the quantity so purchased from any unsatisfied Order to Plexus. In such event Harmonic agrees to make reasonable commercial efforts to purchase, or cause to be purchased, materials from Plexus for the manufacture of Products by a third party, if feasible under the circumstances. 29.5. Relationship of the Parties. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to create an agency, partnership or joint venture between Harmonic and Plexus. It is further agreed and understood that neither party nor its employees shall be deemed to be in the employment of the other and shall have no express or implied right or authority under this Agreement to assume or create any obligations on behalf of the other party to any contract, agreement or undertaking with any third party. 29.9.1 In the performance hereof, the Parties shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, or ordinances of any federal, state, local or other government agency of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, including but not limited to, procurement of required permits and/or certificates. Parties shall comply with all applicable federal, state and/or local laws in any applicable jurisdiction that require products, materials, services or containers furnished to be constructed, packaged, labeled or registered in a prescribed manner. 29.12. Complete Agreement. This Agreement in conjunction with all relevant Exhibits, constitutes the complete contract between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, communications, agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each party represents and agrees that it has not relied on any representation or warranty other than those contained herein in entering into this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Exhibits attached hereto, the, terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail. All costs of pre-carriage, freight, and insurance applicable to the transition of any material, including but not limited to, components, tools, and test equipment, from existing subcontractors and Harmonic to designated sites shall be borne by Plexus. Any VAT, duties, customs, or other charges or fees assessed by any government applicable to the transition with respect to any material or components shall be borne by Plexus, and with respect to tools and test equipment, shall be equally shared between the parties. c. Transition pricing shall include plan to transition to Plexus approved vendors with specific timeline identifying date of implementation of pricing received in original quote. Quoted prices have to take effect after consumption of transferred inventory and Harmonic approval of new sources. It is understood that the conversion to Plexus sources need to be initiated at the start of the transition period to insure that quoted pricing is realized by Harmonic 90 days after successful product transfer to Plexus or qualification of new sources by Harmonic, whichever is sooner. 6. Plexus and Harmonic will meet every three (3) months during the term of this Agreement to review pricing and determine whether any price increase or decrease is required. Any change in price shall apply only to shipments by Plexus at a mutually agreed to date. A risk liability program to measure performance on risk liability shall also be reviewed. This program shall include product overall component and production lead-time reduction reviews. 7. Plexus shall make no change in manufacturing location without Harmonics prior written approval. Plexus will bear all costs associated with transferring production between sites when Plexus directs the move. Transition costs associated with moves requested by Harmonic for cost reduction purposes will be borne by Harmonic and 100% of cost reduction savings goes to Harmonic, unless the parties agree to equally share transition costs then Section 9 below applies to any cost savings after Plexus recovers its share of the transition costs. 1. Harmonic will be liable only for custom engineered components (CEC), long lead items, non-cancelable/non-returnable, and mutually agreed upon minimum order quantity items reporting to assemblies on Orders only. For items with lead-times greater than [*] ([*]) days, Plexus will provide an itemized list (LLT list) of these items and will submit to Harmonic for approval and any additional changes will be approved on an as needed basis. Harmonic also agrees to assume material liability for safety stock items or other materials which both parties agree to purchase from time to time. 6. For the purposes of this Exhibit D, (i) Obsolete Inventory shall mean those components in inventory or on order that no longer appear on a Harmonic bill of materials or which appear on a Harmonic bill of materials for a Product that has no Order or forecast demand; (ii)Inactive Inventory shall mean those components in inventory or on order that are on the bill of material for an Product that has current Order or forecast demand, but which demand will not consume such components; and (iii)Excess Inventory shall mean those components in inventory or on order that are projected to be consumed by a Harmonic Order or forecasted demand, but not within the next one hundred twenty (120) calendar days. 7. Plexus agrees to carry Inactive and Excess Inventory at no more than [*] ([*]) of Plexus latest fiscal quarterly revenue with Harmonic. Included in the [*] ([*]) calculation are the End of Life components identified in Section 4 above. When reviewed monthly, if the [*] ([*]) threshold is exceeded, Plexus shall allow ninety (90) additional calendar days for the amount in excess of the [*] ([*]) threshold to be consumed. If the amount is not consumed in such ninety (90) calendar days, Harmonic shall pay Plexus a monthly carrying charge of [*] ([*]) on the amount over the [*] ([*]) for a period not to exceed an additional ninety (90) calendar days. If at the end of that time the Inactive and Excess Inventory is still not consumed, Harmonic shall pay Plexus a cash deposit for the amount in excess of the [*] ([*]) plus MOH. Obsolete Inventory shall be identified by Plexus and reported to Harmonic on a monthly basis. Harmonic shall make reasonable commercial efforts to review such report and buy from Plexus any Obsolete Inventory within ten (10) business days, but in no event later than twenty (20) business days of receipt of such report. Plexus shall make reasonable commercial efforts to consume or sell off commercial Obsolete, Inactive or Excess components on behalf of Harmonic unless otherwise notified in writing by Harmonic. 6. Harmonic shall have the right to audit the actual quantities of Products in Finished Goods Inventory during normal Plexus business hours upon forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice. In the event that the actual Finished Goods Inventory is less than Harmonics accounting records, the difference shall be manufactured and delivered to Harmonic by Plexus within two weeks at no cost to Harmonic. Plexus shall have the right to verify Harmonics accounting records and Harmonic shall make reasonable disclosures to Plexus in order to affect said audit. Harmonic agrees to make all reasonable efforts to provide Plexus with historical Demand data for all Assemblies relevant to the program being entered upon. This will include, by Assembly number, original Purchase Order creation date, original Purchase Order requested Delivery Date, and quantity requested. Historical Demand data will be used in conjunction with the agreed upon Modeling Inputs (Demand Flexibility, Service Level, ARO, Manufacturing and Component Lead-Time(s) to establish Safety Stock, ROP and ROQ levels for Components and Sub-Assemblies.) Harmonic understands that Plexus utilized the Modeling Inputs stipulated in this Addendum in creating an optimal fulfillment model and associated cost model. If, after a period of time, the actual Modeling Inputs deviate from what was originally modeled, Plexus reserves the right to request that a new optimal fulfillment model, and corresponding cost model, be implemented. Harmonic agrees to issue Purchase Orders for an Assembly at least a Manufacturing Lead-Time in advance of the requested Delivery Date set forth in Harmonics Purchase Order. Plexus will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to (CTO) Purchase Orders in writing within 24 hours with either its acceptance or rejection of the Purchase Order. Any rejection by Plexus of a Purchase Order shall be accompanied with an explanation of the reasons for the rejection. Plexus will make reasonable efforts to accommodate all Purchase Orders. Under Demand Flexibility parameters, Demand changes and cancellations will be handled based on the agreed level of Demand Flexibility described herein. Any changes that fall within the agreed ranges will result in no additional liability or any additional costs to Harmonic, unless explicitly described in writing by Plexus prior to the exercise of the change or cancellation. Any changes that fall outside of the agreed levels of Demand Flexibility require Harmonic to pay for any costs incurred by Plexus to exercise the change or cancellation. All such costs are to be paid per the payment terms in the PSA. Plexus will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate any increase in Demand by Harmonic. Plexus will notify Harmonic in writing as soon as practicable of any Components impeding Harmonics requested increase in Demand. Should any additional costs be required to expedite delivery of Assemblies or Components to meet Harmonics increase in Demand, Plexus will notify Harmonic in writing of the same and, if approved by Harmonic in writing, Harmonic shall pay Plexus for such additional cost."
