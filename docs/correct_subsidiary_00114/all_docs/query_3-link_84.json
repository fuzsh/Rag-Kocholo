While the send and receive levels have always been OK, I'm a bit surprised to see that your downstream SNR has taken a 4 dB turn for the worse. Perhaps while you weren't looking, the receive SNR was even worse too.\n\nI wonder if you have a source for borrowing a cable modem for a day or so? If so, that's the next logical item to try. If you have any other services from your cable provider, I would ask if you receive any intermittent losses of service. e.g. If you have cable based telephone service, do you experience any voice dropouts from the opposite end.\n\nIf you have television service, do you experience losses of signal or video \"tiling\" that might coincide with your Internet failures? If you have any cable splitters or multiport couplers between your cable modem and your demarcation point, you might consider switching things around and disconnect/reconnect cables that haven't been touched in years. Tighten everything with a 7/16\" open end wrench such that you use\n\n*slightly* more force than your fingers are capable of. Some of your oldest F59 connector plugs might be overdue for replacement. RG-59 coax could be upgraded to good quality RG-6. Do you have any sort of on-site cable equipment that might contribute to this, or hasn't been mentioned?\n\nIs your cable ingress from a utility pole or underground?\n\nI suppose you could always set aside your own cable modem and rent one from your provider for a month or so. Comcast, in NoCal, rents ours out at $3/Mo.\n\nWhat do you think about all this?\n\nPete\n\nReply to\n\n1PW\n\nNotify me about replies to my post\n\n1\n\n1PW\n\nposted\n\n15 years ago\n\nFri, Oct 3, 2008 3:45 AM\n\nHello Bill:\n\nI'm fairly sure it would take me a month of Sundays to adapt the Pearl script from Terayon TJ715x use to Scientific Atlanta DPC2100 use.

YMMV. Your receive SNR /was/ fair at 33.4 dB, and would be even better at 35 dB. However you have reported your receive SNR to be as poor as 29.0 dB today and you might start seeing receive errors.\n\nSounds reasonable. I just hope you don't bring home a worse one. This happened to me with three Motorola HD cable receivers. Just as I was about to cancel all service, they unpacked a new model for me to \"try just one more time\".

I would consider asking your provider for a cable that can replace your existing one. I would *not* buy one from Radio Shack or the equivalent. The replacement will probably/should be made of high quality RG6 coax, and have the latest good quality crimped connectors. It certainly wouldn't hurt to request the provider give you the latest model cable modem with the latest firmware.\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\n\nReply to\n\n1PW\n\nNotify me about replies to my post\n\nA\n\nAnt\n\nposted\n\n15 years ago\n\nSat, Oct 4, 2008 5:37 AM\n\nIs that the white coax cable (its printed texts say \"Adelphia Communication E830032A (UL) CATV AWG 063840\") that goes from outside to into the house? If so, then Adelphia's contractors set that line (hope it is a high quality) up back in March 2001. The house never had cable TV before so the holes had to be drilled, cables, stapled to outside walls, etc. This was back when Excite@Home was the service and Adelphia just took over Century Communications. I assume the contractors cabled from my room to downstair outdoor (no splitters and stuff).\n\nHeh. I was trying to read the texts on the cable line in my room and my cable modem decide to lose synchronization. I had to wiggle the connector to the modem again. It's not loose either.\n\nReply to\n\nAnt\n\nNotify me about replies to my post\n\n1\n\n1PW\n\nposted\n\n15 years ago\n\nSat, Oct 4, 2008 8:56 AM\n\nIf the coax is one unbroken piece of cabling, from the demarcation point to the coaxial connector on your Terayon TJ715x, then it would be difficult for you to replace that cable. In that case, and if indeed you have an intermittent connection at the modem end where the male coaxial connector terminates the cable, then it might be best if your service provider sends a technician out to trim off a few inches of the coax and crimp a new male connector on. The other possibility is that the female connector, on the Terayon cable modem, has become intermittent and the most reasonable remedy is to replace the modem.\n\nIf indeed you exchange cable modems on Saturday, that should further isolate the trouble for you. Remember to exchange the wall wart power adapter too.\n\nReply to\n\n1PW\n\nNotify me about replies to my post\n\nA\n\nAnt\n\nposted\n\n15 years ago\n\nSat, Oct 4, 2008 3:15 PM\n\nYeah, I have the whole box, cable modem, and power AC (why do I want to keep it?) to return.
