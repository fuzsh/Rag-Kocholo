It boots in under 10secs, seems a bit quicker then my SB4100 as well.\n\ncapcas5\n\njoin:2001-06-06\n\nSumner, WA\n\ncapcas5\n\nMember\n\nThanks for the fast response. I was setting up the cable modem for a friend and I had not seen a terayon before. It seems the comast tech did not want to take the time to run the cable to his computer, so they left the gear with the statement that they could not set up new users due to the internet attack that was going on. I ran cable to his computer, connected the modem, register the connection and up and running he was.\n\ncapcas"
