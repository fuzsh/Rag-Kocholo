Mobile handset maker Motorola, Inc. (MOT) on Friday said it has completed its $140 million acquisition of Terayon Communication Systems, Inc. (TERN.PK). The company acquired Terayon's common stock for $1.80 per share in cash. The transaction is expected to be neutral to Motorola's earnings per share in 2007, excluding certain non-cash charges and other one-time accounting and transaction-related costs.

Terayon will now be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, being part of Motorola Home & Network Mobility . Motorola will maintain Terayon's operations in Santa Clara. The companies said on April 23 they signed a definitive merger agreement and the deal obtained shareholder approval on June 28.

Terayon has software-driven application solutions that can provide video processing solutions, which will enable digital ad insertion, motion and graphical overlays, channel branding and channel line-up solutions as well as cutting-edge ad insertion delivery technologies.

These can increase Motorola's video infrastructure and seamless mobility core. These solutions will enable the company's customers to optimize bandwidth and deliver content based upon the regional and local interest of viewers.

MOT is currently trading at $17.84, down $0.38 or 2.09%, on 13 million shares.
