        "text": "Welcome Back!! This is my first post for 2014 & actually my first for a good little while. I hope everyone had a wonderful festive season & that the start of 2014 has been amazing so far.\n\nMy first review for this year is actually for an Australian subscription box, VIOLET BOX that contacted me & offered to send out their box free of charge to review. Violet Box is one of the newer subscription services on the market. At $22.95 it is slightly more pricey than other boxes that I’ve had ongoing subscriptions to, so I was interested to see their offering in comparison to the $15.95 boxes I have received in the past.\n\nUpon receiving my Parcel I must say that the box it came in is quite nice, not overly indifferent to any other subscription service, but the violet bow is a nice touch.\n\nI opened the box & the violet tissue & Description card are the first things I notice. The card gives a brief description of everything within the box.\n\nThe first product I grab out is the Body Armour Ultimate Skin Protection Face Cream 50ml. RRP $35.00 This is a full size product, & at $35 it alone has paid for your violet box. I must say you always feel like you get your value if there is a full size product included. Body armor however is not a brand I am familiar with, the cream claims to be paraben free & suitable for use after intensive facial treatments, so I am assuming it is a healing type cream. It is reasonably thick in consistency, but doesn’t seem to be overly greasy or filmy once applied to the skin. I’d say 1 pump would be enough for your whole face, so I can imagine with daily use it should last more than a month. I am looking forward to putting this cream to the test. I am always on the hunt for the perfect moisturizer.\n\nNext I notice there are 2 full size Model Co products included, a blush & an eyeliner. I have used Model co Tanning products before, but never any of their make-up.\n\nI am a self confessed Make-up addict so I am immediately drawn to these products & i must say, I’M IMPRESSED!!\n\nThe Model Co Colour Box Eye Pencil plus Sharpener has a RRP of $18.00 which seems reasonably expensive for a brand that I am sure is more renowned for their tanning products. I’m not entirely sure where it fits, it’s not “high end”I’d say its not “drugstore” either. More like department store.\n\nThe quality of the packaging is nice anyway. It comes first in a box, then you open to find the pencil which includes a sharpener on the lid. Very handy! I don’t know about anyone else, but I HATE having to sharpen pencils. I always tend to run them down till the wood is literally scraping my eye & then I will sharpen them, so I am sure this will avoid me being so lazy.\n\nThe colour of the eyeliner is 01 Black & it is a crayon formulation. My favourite eyeliner has to be the MAC Smoulder eye kohl so I will be comparing it directly with that.\n\nUpon trying the liner on the back of my hand it glides on effortlessly! It also seems like it blends & smudges seamlessly so I’d assume you’d either have to set it with some black shadow should you want to use it on your upper eyelid, or smudge it out with a brush. I don’t think it would be very good for a cat eye as you would end up with it everywhere. None the less seems to be a very nice product.\n\nNext is the Model Co Blush which is also Full Size with a RRP of $18.00 again, department store price. Packaging again is quite nice, comes in a box then you remove the compact. I love the packaging for this. It has a clear lid so you can see the colour of the blush & then underneath slides out a mirror. Very clever design. The colour of the blush is DIVINE!! I think it would be almost a perfect dupe for NARS ORGASM. Its a beautiful peachy pinky rosy colour just that perfect in the middle colour with a stunning gold shimmer that runs through. DEFINITELY a colour that I would pick, and something that I think would suit every skin tone. Highly pigmented, blends beautifully. The only negative I would say is its slightly powdery, I am yet to wear it on my cheeks (only because I have been saving it for this post) but I am no doubt going to LOVE LOVE LOVE it. What a discovery, can’t wait to find where they are stocked so I can try even more!\n\nNext are the Tailor Masque Detoxifying treatment. I received two of these cards with the samples, which I don’t know if that was a mistake or not, but oh well I guess the more the merrier, as long as I like the product. These have a RRP of $40 for a pack of 10. Just quietly I think this is a really odd way of selling a product. If you are buying a full size of a mask wouldn’t you want it in a tube, or a jar? Seems like a fairly basic clay mask with a couple of essential oils blended in for healing purposes, nothing special, I will use though, I do have oily/breakout prone skin so these will be suitable for me, however I cant see any benefits for anyone other than that skin type with a clay based mask.\n\nLastly I received 2 Perfume samples from Guess. I must admit Guess has to be one of my least favourite brands. I just find it a bit tacky, also I am very much a signature fragrance type person I love theirry mugler fragrances, & I tend not to stray. That aside, of course just for review purposes I of course tried these samples, and as expected, not for me. Firstly the Guess NIGHT sample is actually FOR MEN??? Uhh.. okay, thanks. I will give it to my boyfriend. Lucky I’ve got one to give it to otherwise that could be awkward. Secondly the female sample Guess GIRL is in the WORST WORST WORST packaging for a perfume sample I have ever seen. Its in a little sachet, which not only I hate anything in a sachet but perfume is LIQUID, my leggings now smell like headache, which would be my best way to describe this fragrance. I really don’t know if its fruity, or floral, its really just one of those nothing scents. Like unrecognizable, just nothing special & now, I’m covered in it. Lucky Me. for a 50ml of the GUESS GIRL you’d pay $49 & for a 100ml of GUESS Night you’d pay $69. Not something I’d recommend to do.\n\nOVERALL I’d still recommend the Violet box, I think you get more than value for money based on what is in this box. Definitely the star products for me are the Model Co Make-up, not something I probably would have otherwise tried, but glad that I have.\n\nAs far as subscription boxes go however I have actually cancelled both of my ongoing subscriptions to both bellabox & lusthaveit, which I must admit was a bit of a mission, they don’t make it very easy. I am slightly over the whole sample boxes for the moment. Probably because I have enough samples now to last me a lifetime & there hasn’t been anything overwhelmingly amazing that I have been introduced to that has been worth the $30 odd per month (which really does add up over time) 10 months = $300 I could have just gone to whatever my favourite brand is & gone on a bit of a spree. Not to mention most counters within Myer or DJs will freely give you samples should you ask.\n\nOkay Okay!! I’ll be the first to admit it. I LOVE FAKE TANNING… Not to the crazy dip yourself in doritos & look like an oompa loompa extent, but I do always feel so much better about myself with a little kiss of golden tan, and believe me, when I say I have done the research.\n\nIn my salon I offer spray tanning as a service & I have currently 3 different brands that I am using, and within those brands I have 8 different types of solution. I like to have a variety because from brand to brand and solution to solution tans can really be QUITE different.\n\nToday however I am focusing on the homecare products. So tanning lotions that you can apply yourself either to top up your professional spray tan, or just to give yourself a bit of colour from scratch and I have my top 3 products starting from light to dark that I am going to review for you.\n\nSUMMER TAN – Light Self action tan.\n\nSummer tan is produced for Mancine Cosmetics which is a wholesaler, manufacturer and supplier of professional beauty products.\n\nThe Light self action tan with walnut oil and aloe vera is my favourite product of their range because it has a beautiful light consistancy, it glides onto the skin & is absorbed in like a moisturiser without leaving a tacky residue.\n\nI’d almost consider this product to be similar to a gradual tanner but with a little bit more oomph. I also like the fact that that it goes on clear & develops over time. Bronzers can be great but sometimes they have the ability to just get all over your sheets & whatever your wearing/touching so this is a good alternative.\n\nIt can take a few applications to build up a nice golden colour, but it really is a fool proof tan & it is very adaptable so you have the flexibility to cater it to your skin colour depending on how often you apply. The summer tan will last you approx 7 days with a light colour & I find it fades quite naturally & evenly.\n\n250ml RRP $23.95\n\nNext up is the MINX GANACHE\n\nThis is my personal favourite & what I tend to reach for most. Minx is a gorgeous boutique tanning range distributed through inskincosmedics which are known for their amazing cosmedical and cosmeceutical skincare ranges O Cosmedics and Emergin C, both of which I stock at my salon.\n\nSo when they teamed up with the lovely Monica from Minx it seemed like natural progression to give their tanning range a go. In clinic I use both the Minx Chocolate Sun and Eclipse Spray tans & I always prefer where possible to use the same range of home care to compliment.\n\nGanache is a beautiful fluid like lotion, it glides onto the skin creating an instant glow with its built in natural bronzers of caffeine and caramel. It has a sweet almost edible smell and with their Vitamin E and B Complex its also contributing to the health and hydration of the skin. I find it is instantly buildable, I normally apply one coat, wait five minutes and apply a second. This creates the most beautiful soft golden tan.\n\nI like to use ganache on 2 consecutive days to build the colour that I want & I find it will last about 7 days before it starts to fade naturally as the skin desquamates. I also like to use and recommend Ganache to maintain the longevity of a spray tan. Perfect if you are heading away on holiday & want to top up and really get the most out of your spray tan.\n\nGanache also comes with a complimentary applicator mitt which ensures that even the most novice self tanners will achieve a perfect streak free tan. The mitt also protects your hand from being stained by the bronzer or having the tan develop on the palms.\n\nRRP $39.95 250mls (including applicator mitt)\n\nLastly is NAKED TAN GODDESS BRONZE\n\nNaked Tan has been a staple product in my salon for the last 3 years & the Goddess Bronze is no exception. This product is just such a true fake tan so if you are wanting instant colour & a medium to dark tan to follow this is the product for you.\n\nNaked tan have been renowned for their 2hr Rapid tans & this goes also for their cream product. Yes you can wash & wear the Goddess Bronze after just 2hrs, its perfect for that quick fix.\n\nThe product its self if much thicker than the previous two tans I have featured. Its definitely more of a thick cream consistency and you do really need to work it into the skin. I find with ALL naked tan products, spray tans included that you do feel that bit more sticky, but its totally worth it because the product only needs 1/4 of the processing time.\n\nWhile the Goddess bronze also features instant bronzers they are slightly more on the greenish side, so I wouldn’t go rushing out to an event with the tan still on, but at the same time the tan develops into a beautiful deep golden colour & the green counteracts any orange undertones.\n\nI only ever use one application of the Goddess Bronze and you are good to go for a whole week. At the end of the week I’d recommend to give yourself a good exfoliation to take care of any lingering tan as with any deeper colours the tan will look slightly more obvious as it starts to wear off.\n\nIts essential to give hands a thorough wash following an application of goddess glaze to prevent staining from the bronzer in the product & to prevent the tan from developing on the palms. Ingredients include Aloe Vera, Shea Butter and avocado oil so you will feel your skin be instantly hydrated.\n\n150ml $31.95\n\nWith ANY fake tanning I’d always recommend to give your skin a good exfoliation, focusing on areas particularly that you get dry skin. Ensure that whatever hair removal you normally do is done the day before your application for best results, and your tan be applied to clean, dry skin with no deodorant, body lotion or make-up. Remember that fake tanning is all about trial and error. It may take some time to find a product that is perfectly suited to you. Don’t let one bad experience put you off, no two tanning ranges are the same & there is something for everyone so whether you want just a light sun-kissed glow or a deep Mediterranean tan there will definitely be a product out there for you.\n\nI’d still prefer a spray tan any day of the week as opposed to DIY cream tanning just for its simplicity and flawless end result. It usually takes 10-15 minutes only to get a spray tan & you get peace of mind knowing your full body is covered evenly.\n\nLet me know in the comments what your favourite fake tan is and why, or if you would like me to do a post all about professional spray tans!\n\nTill Next Time..\n\nBOM xx\n\nFirstly sorry I’ve been a bit absent as of late. I’m still a little bit unsure as to the direction I am wanting to take with this blog. Being a Beauty Therapist I have a bit of insight into the “professional” side of the beauty industry in regards to products and their ingredients, skin science & conditions, all beauty treatments, tanning etc. I also am in LOVE with all other things beauty & spend countless hours on youtube, buying make-up at department stores, chemists (drugstores) & the like so I am a bit torn as to what to focus my posts on. So if you decide to follow my blog, you might find my posts will be all over the place until I settle into a routine of regular updates. A big thanks to all of the readers of my blog to date. Its been the overwhelming amount of views I’ve received that has encouraged me to continue. 🙂\n\nWithout further delay I’ll jump into my review of the July 2013 Bella Box – Luxe Beauty Travel Edition.\n\nFirst thing I see when I open the box is my “BONUS” Luxe city guide for Bangkok. It’s basically a glossy 11 page pocket sized pamphlet guide containing information on all things to do in Bangkok. It recommends accommodation, lunch/brunch spots, bars, spa & beauty, activities & a bit of useful information like hospitals, taxi services etc. Now I’ve been to Bangkok before. I have no real intention on returning & chances are by then I will lose this little guide. I might keep it on hand in case I have a friend or client that’s heading off over there, but it does seem like a good little guide so next time I am heading off somewhere I might just look & see if one is available for my destination. They would also make a cute gift for a friend heading abroad.\n\nThey are available for US $9.99 from http://www.luxecityguides.com\n\nNext up is a La Clinica Rebalancing Vitamin A Facial Cleanser 50ml – Travel Size (RRP $42.00 for 200ml)\n\nNow I LOVE Vitamin A, so this product immediately grabs my attention. Normally I prefer to use a foaming cleanser on my skin being more of an oily/combo skin type, the only exception being when a creamy cleanser includes exfoliating ingredients (either AHA/BHA or Vit A) So this is definitely something that I would have picked for myself. I’ve pumped it out on the back of my hand & it seems to have a nice creamy texture, hopefully it will be able to break down my makeup effectively because I hate using an additional makeup remover, I prefer just to double cleanse. I have a feeling I will have to use this product in conjunction with a wet face cloth to remove. It has quite a herbal smell about it as most natural/organic products tend to, its obviously incorporating essential oil ingredients, but unfortunately they aren’t listed on the packaging.\n\nThere is also a couple of sachet samples included (HATE SACHETS)\n\nThe first one being a 3ml sample of the Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream. This has the word CULT next to it on the info card – yet I have never heard of it. I have already cracked open the sachet for closer inspection & this cream is definitely more on an ointment texture. The directions are to rub a moderate amount in your palms until i takes the form of an oil & gently apply over your skin. With ingredients like beeswax, honey, bee pollen, royal jelly & propalis I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this for use for anyone with a bee sting allergy, as these ingredients are all derivatives of bee activity. On the skin it feels quite greasy (as expected) and it has a rather unusual smell. Almost like the smell of a smokers hands after they have washed them to try & disguise it. Yet I can imagine this cream would be very good for healing & hydrating.\n\n118ml RRP $49.00\n\nNext in a La Fresh Eco Beauty acetone free nail polish remover pad. This will go straight into my handbag. So many times I get caught out with horrible chipped nail polish so this will be handy to remove on the run. I’m always a bit skeptical when it comes to acetone free nail polish removers though. Especially because I love to use good quality polish & always apply a good top coat to try & maintain their chip-free life so hopefully this manages to do a good removal. It claims that 1 pad will clean & condition all 10 nails.\n\n18 or 20 (?) sachets per box RRP $16.50\n\nLibra Hotties Heat Patch – Now this seemed a little random. Its currently on my lower back as I am writing this (although its meant for menstrual cramping) being a cold Melbourne Winter day I thought it might be nice anyway & I was right. I’m not sure that I would actually purchase these as there are MANY other options for reusable heat packs on the market, but that’s not to say it isn’t a nice idea. It is about 15cm x10cm in size with sticky patches on either side so you can actually stick it to whatever area you are needing a bit of heated comfort. It is self activated by air as soon as you take it out of its sachet & takes about 5-10 minutes to fully heat up, but they claim it stays heated for 5-8 hours.\n\n2 per pack RRP $4.99\n\n3 More items to go…\n\nNext up in a Big Pod that took up most of the box is the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Total nourishing care Shampoo & Conditioner samples. I must say – I LOVE trying new Shampoo & Conditioner. I have never really remained that loyal to any one brand for any period of time so I am really looking forward to trying these. They smell amazing. The packaging kind of reminds me of Pantene. (Not sure why) but they are 50ml each in size which will be a good amount for at least a couple of washes. The brand Clear I think is actually quite new on the market & has Miranda Kerr as their ambassador. I know that Miranda is usually pretty partial to her Organic products… Which I think these are not. So who is to know if she actually uses them. Their claim is that you will have stronger, more beautiful hair in 7 days & the packaging is really promoting the “7 day challenge” I usually only wash my hair once a week, so I think I’ll give that a miss. But I am excited to try these products none the less.\n\n200ml RRP $5.99\n\nAnother “CULT” product sample I’ve never heard of is the Yu-Be Moisturizing skin cream. Its a little 3gm sample reminiscent of those little colgate tubes you get at hotels. Its instructions are to apply to dry skin or lips, I applied it to my lips & almost immediately regretted it – may be better suited to areas where you can’t taste it. Ingredients include Glycerin, vit b2 c & e, sodium hyaluronate & camphor, which is a good little combination full of hydration & antioxidants. This cream has been the best seller in Japan for 50 years. I’ll give it another go on my face tonight after I’ve washed my skin, but I don’t think it will be the most suitable thing for me, but nice to try anyway.\n\n70g RRP $34.95\n\nLastly one of the products I was most excited to try has so far turned out to be the most disappointing. Model Co Cheek + Lips Tint in Rosy Red 5ml. Now I do love a good lip product, but this is definitely NOT one of them as far as I am concerned. Not only does it not look very nice on the lips, it stained but only in parts (kind of in the way that a red or blue lolly cruiser drink would) but it also stained my finger. It didn’t blend out nicely & was a bit of a mess to apply. It didn’t seem to have any lip care benefit either. I will however try it as a cheek product but at the moment I don’t have a lot of faith that it will turn out very well either. All in all not something I would recommend or repurchase.\n\n10ml RRP $24.00\n\nI really hate to end on a sour note – so I won’t. Bella box is a clear winner as far as subscription sample boxes for Australia go really. Definitely better value & variety than what I find the Lust Have It boxes to be. I think this July box really has a good variety between hair, body, makeup, skincare & all things that I am interested to try. The only downside this month for me is there were no full size products included, which is a shame, I always can justify the value a little bit more if I get a full size product, but there was very good variety in this months box & the overall quality of the sample products given were quite high.\n\nYours in Beauty & Health\n\nBOM xx\n\n-37.763180 144.973498\n\nSo we’ve all heard of shellac.\n\nThe nail polish/gel hybrid fad/cult power polish, which claimed to “go on like polish, wear like gel, off in minutes”.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with shellac. I love the way it lasts. I hate the way it damages the nails & the application & removal process is a little more tedious than their claims. Your hand is in and out of the UV lamp 4 times – I guess its not THAT annoying, but not exactly on like polish. The removal process is also a little inconvenient. I’ll be the first to admit that I’ve been guilty of picking it all off. Yes. I have sat in my salon, with every removal product and tool at my finger tips and just picked it right off – I think we all know that this is the best yet worst way to actually get it “off in minutes” – hence the nail damage incurred.\n\nSO… When I heard that Creative Nail Design were releasing a Polish alternative to shellac, my ears pricked up straight away.\n\nWELCOME CND VINYLUX\n\n“Lasts 7+ days without chipping, Makes polish more durable over time” Innovative technology creates long-lasting wear and durability with exposure to natural light over time.\n\nThe directions are to clean nails with Scrubfresh. Apply two coats of vinylux weekly polish and finish with one coat of weekly top coat – quite simple in comparison to the chore that I find applying shellac. The reccomended air dry time is 8 minutes.\n\nSo naturally I dashed down to my nearest wholesaler & bought a couple to try. At the wholesaler they are available for $9.95\n\nNow the introductory colour selection is already more vast that whats available in the way of shellac at 62 colours. There are even some colours that overlap to shellac – for example one of my favourite Shellac shades is Cakepop from the spring 2013 collection & I was very excited to discover this shade was available in vinylux.\n\nMy collection of vinylux colours is at 13 and growing and I’ve had my polishes for around a month now – so having done a few applications on myself & others, let me get down to my review.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION:\n\nIts been AGES since ive had a “proper” manicure, and when I tend to do my own nails I keep it very basic. I file, sometimes buff & do a quick application of polish, so as you can imagine my cuticles are looking a little worse for wear.\n\nAfter prepping my nails with scrubfresh I of course chose my favourite colour Cake pop & applied 2 thin coats. The polish applied beautifully. Even with a rushed job the end result was very smooth – I found the brush to be a good size & easy to work with. Cakepop is a very pigmented creamy light pink. I think it drys ever so slightly darker than how it looks in the bottle, & maybe a little more pink than its shellac alternative.\n\nMy nails following an application of VINYLUX Cake pop\n\nI didn’t time the dry time, but it was noticeably quicker than using an Essie or OPI polish.\n\nLasting Power – I got 5 chip free days – 2 shorter than the 7+ claimed by CND, but I’ll be honest that I was still surprised & rather impressed by this. Being in the beauty industry as a therapist my hands are constantly in water and various products, oils, peels and cleaning solutions. Normally with a polish application I am surprised if i get 2 chip free days, so 5 seemed like a miracle. Throughout this 5 day duration my polish stayed quite glossy looking also.\n\nWhat I love most is just like any other polish its literally off in seconds with a quick swipe of acetone or polish remover on a cotton pad.\n\nPRO TIP: When painting i always like to cap the end of the nail & making sure it coats the tip ever so slightly to ensure longevity of the polish application. I also like to wait about 30 seconds or so after I’ve done my colour coats before applying top coat to give the polish time to set & ensure the colour doesn’t transfer into my top coat. (especially when using colours that have a shimmer)\n\nEasy application. Quick dry time. Good lasting power. Easy removal. – It really ticks all of the boxes for me.\n\nEven with shellac I’ve sometimes experienced chipping or lifting after a few days following a lousy or thick application.\n\nHaving used vinylux for 3 or 4 consecutive weeks now I’ve noticed no staining to my nail bed – I was a little worried through lack of a base coat, but have had no issue. I really think there is no going back – There are still some colours I just love from my OPI and Essie collection, and these ranges do have such a large following, it may take a while for clients to change over, but as vinylux grows the colour collection, which I imagine they will, there will be no reason for people not to convert. It is a real game changer. Yet again! Well done CREATIVE for being a true leader in the nail industry!\n\nI’d imagine OPI will follow suit & come up with a similar formulation as they did with the OPI gel colour as an answer to CND Shellac. So fingers crossed we will have that to look forward to for all the OPI lovers out there.\n\nSo far in my collection ive got (I’ll work clockwise around my colour wheel swatches)\n\n#126 Lavishly Loved – A VERY sheer creamy nude.\n\n#128 Locket Love – Gorgeous light gold quite shimmery, I’ve been using this as a feature nail on my ring finger.\n\n#127 Limade – Vibrant shimmery lime green. Reminds me of the mazda 2 green.\n\n#102 Azure wish – sky blue creamy colour, has a very slight slight shimmer.\n\n#117 Grape Gum – Deep purple colour similar to cadbury purple with a slight shimmer.\n\n#135 Cake Pop – My personal favourite matte creamy baby pink.\n\n#103 Beau – Sheer very light shimmer pink\n\n#150 Strawberry Smoothie – I can remember this colour from the old creative polish, a pearlescent light pink with a slight shimmer.\n\n#121 Hot Pop Pink – HOT PINK!! glossy with no shimmer.\n\n#112 Electric Orange – BRIGHT ORANGE, slightly darker than how it looks in the bottle. Matte but glossy.\n\n#119 Hollywood – A shellac star – Deep yet bright red with a slight shimmer.\n\n#106 Bloodline – Deep blood red, no shimmer.\n\n#140 Regally yours, First coat this goes on slightly purple & sets to a glossy matte off black.\n\nVinylux is available for all Express ($40) & Deluxe ($65) Manicures & Pedicures in my salon. (Same price as OPI or Essie Polish)\n\nI’d recommend for anyone to give it a try & see the difference for yourself!\n\nUGH!!! Yet again I’ve been occupied & missed the Postman! The card under my door tells me I’ve got a package waiting down at the Lygon Street North post office – available for collection after 4pm & I just KNOW its going to be my MAY Lust have it box. I can hardly WAIT!!\n\nI’ve been subscribed to Lust have it for 4 Months now. So far I am not convinced that I will continue with my subscription. I’m also subscribed to the monthly BELLABOX which I think I have been slightly more impressed with.\n\nSO… without further delay let me jump into my review.\n\nAfter opening the postage wrapping I notice that yet again the box is a different colour – Grey this time. Such a nice touch. They actually make nice boxes to put gifts in – so I’m going to add it to the collection in my bathroom cupboard.\n\nI open up the box & the first thing that grabs my attention is the Nude By Nature cream & brown lid – YAY a full size product. I always think that anytime there is a full size product included, you’ve always got your moneys worth.\n\nI uncover the rest of the items & the list is as follows:\n\n– The Natural Source Camouflage Colour Lipgloss\n\n-Seacret Buffing Block\n\n– Paulas Choice Clear Exfoliating Solution\n\n– Nude By Nature Papaw ointment\n\n– Tigi Elasticate AND Recharge shampoo & conditioner.\n\nOKAY…. So. My first thought was – this is slightly disappointing. My reasons being that while I have received 2 full sized products with a combined value of $25.90 – they are both lip products, and personally the LAST thing I need is another lip product. I think I have about 5 glosses & lipsticks in my handbag alone.\n\nSecond thought was I HATE using samples of shampoo & conditioner that come in Sachets. In fact, I HATE any samples that come in sachets. They are really messy, I tend to just put them in a bathroom drawer & ignore they are there. Now the TIGI samples that are provided are both 10ml sachets. 2 Shampoos, 2 Conditioners.\n\nNEXT\n\nSeacret Buffing block. Maybe because I am in my salon where I have a plethora of buffing options I wasn’t THAT excited for this product either. I’ve used it…. it did a nice job of buffing my nails. One thing I will say is to be very careful not to overuse the course side of this buffer. It definitely rid my nails of any ridges but not something I would do too frequently as with overuse it would weaken the nails.\n\nThe NUDE BY NATURE papaw ointment. I was actually excited to try this as I do tend to steer away from using pawpaw ointments purely because of the petro chemical bases they are often blended with. The claim on the side of the 75gm tub is that its free of petro chemicals, just natural healing extracts for healing relief. One thing I did notice was that in the ingredients listed on the side papaya is listed 2nd LAST to Parfum which means there is only a very small amount of what they are claiming the ointment to be based on. It has quite a sweet pleasant smell, but a VERY unpleasant texture. Its almost like it has curdled. Its like something in the formulation hasn’t blended & there is what seems like little exfoliating beads or chunks in the product. Overall not impressive, not something I would reccomend or repurchase.\n\nThe Camouflage Colour lip balm on the other hand is quite nice. It is a orangey, coral colour with quite a vibrant glitter. On the lips it feels Moisturising – a little on the sticky side, but it goes on quite sheer & just adds a nice shine. I can definitely see this one being added on rotation to the growing amount of lipgloss options in my bag.\n\nNext up is the Paula’s Choice Clear exfoliating solution. I am yet to put this product to the test but I am looking forward to giving it a try. I actually thought it was a cleanser, but has the consistancy of a toner or lotion. It is definately something that I would choose for my skin being on the breakout prone side, but is not a brand I’ve heard of. Being a professional skin therapist I am very selective about what I use on my skin, but I am always open to trying new things. – watch this space.\n\nLastly There is a pamphlet to SEACRET – The pamphlet covers all products on the range which I find REALLY ODD considering they provided a buffer & no skincare samples. I believe I recognise the seacret range from in the middle of shopping centres? You know… the ones that scream at you to try their products as you are trying to do your shopping. Not interested.\n\nIn conclusion – not an overly impressive offering. Not really anything that I am THAT excited to try, nor is there anything I would have otherwise purchased. I guess that’s the reason I have the subscription though…. I think I’ll give Lust have it ONE MORE MONTH to wow me otherwise I’ll cancel. Overall I’ve been more consistently impressed with the quality & variety Bellabox has to offer. But for $15 I guess you cant really complain…\n\nTILL NEXT TIME\n\nXOXO"
