In the last decade they bought numerous small companies ...\n\nSimulator Market: there are 3 big players - Synopsys VCS, Cadence NCSim/NCVerilog/..., Mentor G. ModelSim; ModelSim even after improves in last few years is the slowest one and is used mainly for small projects, in FPGA world, in mixed-language environment; main battle will be in following years between Synopsys and Cadence simulators about support for functional coverage colect and analysis, support of HVLs like e or Vera or SystemVerilog (without co-simulation), etc.\n\nASIC Synthesis Market - DC has 90+% of market, Cadence last try to be more important here is accuisition of Get2Chip, but it look that it will not be much more succesfull then Ambit ...\n\nFPGA Synthesis Market - some small players are main here like Synplicity\n\nPhysical Synthesis Market - was divided between Cadence (PKS, Ambit) and Synopsys/Avanti tools\n\nStatic Timing Analysis Market - Synopsys PrimeTime has ~100%\n\nASIC Floorplanning Market - Cadence First Encounter was in advance\n\nASIC P&R Market - still the biggest market and Cadence is still in advance\n\nand so on for SPICE Market, Analog Simulation Market, ATPG Market, BIST Market, Scan Insertion Market, RC Extraction Market, DRC Market, Power Reduction Synthesis Market, etc.\n\nvisualart\n\nAdvanced Member level 1\n\nJoined\n\nDec 21, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n466\n\nHelped\n\n28\n\nReputation\n\n56\n\nReaction score\n\n4\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,298\n\nActivity points\n\n3,333\n\ncadence vs synopsys\n\nIt is the best that the simulator of Cds\n\nand synthesis of snps\n\naltra\n\nJunior Member level 1\n\nJoined\n\nSep 7, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n18\n\nHelped\n\n0\n\nReputation\n\n0\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,281\n\nActivity points\n\n201\n\ncadence synopsis\n\nThe service from cadence are so bad than synopsys,but synopsys are also expensive.So ,the most important thing is what you want.\n\nmariaR\n\nAdvanced Member level 4\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 28, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n110\n\nHelped\n\n3\n\nReputation\n\n6\n\nReaction score\n\n2\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,298\n\nActivity points\n\n697\n\nsynopsis tools\n\naltra said:\n\nThe service from cadence are so bad than synopsys,but synopsys are also expensive.So ,the most important thing is what you want.\n\nThat's not true. EDA company treat you differently depend on how big customer you are. We have bad experiences with Synopsys and a few good experience wirth Cadence. The price is almost the same if you know how to negociate\n\nbellbell\n\nNewbie level 5\n\nJoined\n\nJan 29, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n8\n\nHelped\n\n0\n\nReputation\n\n0\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,281\n\nActivity points\n\n66\n\ncadence vs synopsis\n\nI think it would be better to have both tools. As a digital IC designer, you may want to use Cadence's schematic capture tool, Verilog simulator, and its layout tools like SE; you may also want to use Synopsys for synthesis and power estimation and etc.\n\nbeta0\n\nMember level 5\n\nJoined\n\nNov 24, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n88\n\nHelped\n\n7\n\nReputation\n\n14\n\nReaction score\n\n2\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,288\n\nActivity points\n\n393\n\nsynopsis vs cadence\n\nNo one is better,there is no one who can give you a total solution.\n\nz81203\n\nFull Member level 5\n\nJoined\n\nAug 1, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n308\n\nHelped\n\n5\n\nReputation\n\n10\n\nReaction score\n\n1\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,298\n\nActivity points\n\n2,356\n\n/ synopsys / cadence\n\nMagma said they have total solution.

Cadence BuildGate is not bad, but it's much cheaper than DC because it's not so popular and its market share is much smaller than DC. But the full custom tool from Cadence is very expensive compared to the other alternative because of its market share and popularity.\n\nsandusty\n\nMember level 5\n\nJoined\n\nApr 19, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n89\n\nHelped\n\n3\n\nReputation\n\n6\n\nReaction score\n\n1\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,288\n\nActivity points\n\n910\n\nsite:www.edaboard.com synopsys tool\n\nTools didn't do the job, but people do.

Maybe some tool is more convenient than the others, but there is always some way to work around, isn't it : )\n\nthriller_wu\n\nNewbie level 6\n\nJoined\n\nOct 14, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n13\n\nHelped\n\n0\n\nReputation\n\n0\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nTrophy points\n\n1,281\n\nActivity points\n\n98\n\ncadence vs synopsys\n\nI thinks VCS is better than ncverilog"
