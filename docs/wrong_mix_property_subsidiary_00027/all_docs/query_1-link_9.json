        "text": "Designers Can Access Powerful Library, Architectural Synthesis Combination\n\nSAN DIEGO & SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 6, 2001--NurLogic Design, Inc., a developer of high-bandwidth connectivity Intellectual Property (IP) solutions, and Get2Chip Inc., the electronic design automation (EDA) supplier of system-on-chip (SOC) synthesis, today launched a program where physical library models are bundled with architectural and RTL synthesis.\n\nThe distribution program is designed to give hardware designers access to an EDA software evaluation kits that includes qualified standard cell and standard input/output (I/O) libraries. This marks the first time NurLogic has authorized an EDA software supplier to use its front-end intellectual property (IP) models for synthesis.\n\n\"NurLogic's goal is to get our high-performance libraries into the hands of designers to help alleviate the ever-increasing challenges of SOC design,\" says Lisa Lipscomb, vice president of marketing at NurLogic. \"We chose to work with Get2Chip because of the success of its architectural synthesis and its focus in the area of timing abstraction.\"\n\n\"Our customers tell us there is a lack of qualified and reliable IP providers,\" remarks Steve Carlson, Get2Chip's vice president of marketing. \"NurLogic addresses this problem with its silicon-proven IP solutions. We view NurLogic as an important strategic partner.\"\n\nAbout Get2Chip\n\nGet2Chip, Inc., is a leading supplier of software products that enable the design of the world's most complex integrated circuits, primarily found in the communications, wireless, computer, and consumer product markets.
