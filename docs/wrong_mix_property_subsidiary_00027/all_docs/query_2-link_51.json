        "text": "In today’s business climate, organizations continually seek new ways to innovate and gain competitive edges. One key driver of innovation has been the widespread adoption of cloud computing. Today, organizations use on average more than three public clouds and nearly four private clouds.[1] But this proliferation of cloud technologies has come with some challenges. As the number of cloud environments grows, so does the complexity involved in managing them. This presents many challenges – from limited control and visibility to unpredictable costs to inconsistencies in security and compliance practices. Consequently, it can be difficult for organizations to take advantage of the full promise of these multicloud ecosystems, hindering the very innovation they were meant to unlock.\n\nMaking Multicloud Manageable with Ground-to-cloud Strategies\n\nThere are paths to implementing multicloud estates without falling prey to these challenges. A well-executed multicloud by design approach includes thoughtful integrations with public cloud providers to simplify operations. Ground-to-cloud solutions, which involve running software-defined versions of on-premises infrastructure in public clouds, have been instrumental in unlocking innovation for countless organizations. A ground-to-cloud strategy that leverages enterprise management tools IT teams already know and trust in public cloud environments can offer management consistency and improve data mobility in multicloud settings. As a result, organizations can put existing skillsets to use, spend less time managing data and infrastructure and even spend down public cloud investments.\n\nBringing Ground-to-cloud Strategies to your Organization\n\nOne way you can bring a ground-to-cloud strategy to your organization is through Dell APEX Storage for Public Cloud, which makes Dell’s enterprise-class storage available in public clouds along with new management tools that centralize management activities across clouds. IT teams can use the same skills, APIs, management experiences and enterprise-class storage services wherever Dell storage is deployed. For example, organizations looking to support large databases and containerized database workloads, analytics workloads or multiple container deployments, or those who want to consolidate workloads in the public cloud, can use Dell APEX Block Storage for AWS or Dell APEX Block Storage for Microsoft Azure. For file-based workloads like file shares or home directories, Dell APEX File Storage for AWS provides seamless data mobility between on-prem and cloud with native replication and consistent user experiences with familiar interfaces, identity management and built-in security features.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nGround-to-cloud strategies can play a significant role unlocking innovation for organizations in today’s competitive business environment. By leveraging enterprise management tools IT teams already know, providing management consistency across environments and improving data mobility, ground-to-cloud strategies can significantly accelerate speed and agility within organizations, which can result in better, more innovative solutions and faster time to market. Here’s where you can learn more about Dell APEX Storage for Public Cloud."
