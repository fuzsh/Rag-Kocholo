This technology is characterized by its superior throughput, range, and quality of service. A key challenge facing all communication technologies is how to deliver the promised capabilities and services cost effectively. WiMAX technology is setting out to achieve cost effectiveness in an unprecedented way. SoC class of technologies place at the very center of Mobile WiMAX global deployments offering exceptional integration of capabilities and services, portability, very low power consumption, and remarkably high performance. Fujitsu has outlined a very impressive WiMAX product roadmap consisting of a series of SoC solutions to address specific target application areas. Fujitsus vertically integrated semiconductor products sector is able to bring together circuit, IP, design methodology, design libraries, packaging technologies on a platform of a highly scaled COMS technology to address the mobile WiMAX requirements. The complete solution is supported with highly optimized system and media access control SW. An example of our product roadmap is a highly integrated, one-chip mobile baseband SoC, which uses 90nm low-leakage process technology, well-suited for PC cards and other media-rich mobile applications. The mixed-signal SoC has achieved an 18.6Mbps transfer rate in sample installations and lab demonstrations at substantially below 500 mW of power dissipation.\n\nBio: Ray Abrishami is currently the Senior Director of SoC Engineering and Marketing at Fujitsu Microelectronics America, Inc.

Parizi, Principal IC Design Scientist, Broadcom Corporation.\n\n\"Power, Performance, and Programmability requirements for Wireless Application SoCs.\"\n\nThe increasing number of wireless communication standards creates new demands for their platform architectures. In addition to fulfilling high data rate, low cost and low power consumption requirements, they also need to be flexible enough to support multiple standards in a multimode radio system. Traditional Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) cannot provide the target performance for wireless systems. On the other hand, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are the favorite solution for wireless systems. ASIC are fast and consume low power, but they are vulnerable to changes. Even changing small features in ASICs requires repeating most of the design and fabrication process, which is expensive and increases the time to market for these systems. The future growth and development of System on Chip (SOC) technologies for wireless communication systems relies on the longer life cycle of new products. The current approach of integrating ASIC solutions is not economically attractive for the new generation of SOC chips, because of all the nonrecurring expenses (NRE) such as mask, engineering, validation, and the shorter life cycle of the product.\n\nDemands for programmability as well as power and performance have made reconfigurable architectures an attractive alternative solution for wireless systems platforms. In this talk HERS, a Heterogeneous Reconfigurable System is introduced as a platform for wireless communication systems. HERS is a set of reconfigurable engines connected through a general high speed bus. Each reconfigurable engine is a specialized reconfigurable architecture for a category of similar algorithms. As each family of algorithms has a limited set of flexibility requirements, their reconfigurable engine platforms can be highly optimized for power and performance. HERS is an optimal solution in terms of power, programmability and performance.\n\nBio: Hooman T. Parizi is Principal IC Design Scientist at Broadcom Corporation working on design and architecture of high speed DSP chips in DSM technologies. Before joining Broadcom he was with Morpho Technologies, a start up specialized in Reconfigurable DSP architecture and design.\n\nHe holds a PHD degree from university of California at Irvine and is the co-author of more than ten papers. His interest is in Computer Architecture, Reconfigurable Computing, Design Automation, and VLSI implementation of DSP algorithms.\n\nDr. Marco Racanelli, Vice President of Technology and Engineering, Jazz Semiconductor.\n\nKeynote\n\nDr. Marco Racanelli is the Vice President of Technology and Engineering at Jazz Semiconductor, an independent pure-play wafer foundry focused primarily on specialty CMOS process technologies optimized for the manufacture of highly integrated analog and mixed-signal semiconductor devices.

Many of the larger foundries won't even bother offering specialized chip design or device solutions below certain quantity thresholds. Needless to say, the market for specialized IC at modest quantities is significant. In addition, specialized foundries also offer an additional advantage by allowing chip companies to increase their supply-chain security. Partnering with a smaller specialized foundry allows chip companies to diversify their production and optimize their time to market, cost and products performance through tailor-made solutions.\n\nBio: Tower Semiconductor CTO Rafi Nave can address the potential of the specialized foundry business model and discuss the methods that specialty foundries must implement in order to compete in the marketplace. Specialty foundries must expand their production offerings, focusing on dedicated customer service, as well as offer value-adds such as design support and customized business solutions to help customers sustain long-term, reliable performance, while delivering on-time and on-budget results.\n\nFarhad Tabrizi, Chief Executive Officer and President\n\nEmbedded Memory Using Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM).\n\nSpin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) is an emerging memory technology having all the characteristics of an ideal memory universal memory and represents a breakthrough over first-generation, field-switched magnetic random access memory (MRAM) technology. STT-RAMs unique synthesis of non-volatility, fast read and write speed, unlimited endurance, and excellent scalability, provides significant advantages over conventional memory technologies and offers system designers the ability to develop new products with high performance, low power consumption and low cost. In this talk, I will present embedded STT-RAM solutions for SoC applications. eSTT-RAM has key performance and cost advantages for replacing eSRAM, eFlash and eDRAM.\n\nFarhad Tabrizi is president and chief executive officer of Grandis, Inc. In January 2007, he was appointed to this position, succeeding William Almon, Grandis co-founder, who remains a major shareholder. Tabrizi joined the company from Lexar Media, Inc., where he served as vice president, supply chain management and corporate development. Previously, he was vice president of worldwide marketing for Hynix Semiconductor. In this position, he focused on developing, marketing and supporting Hynix's strategies for growing the corporation's DRAM and flash businesses.

He received his Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of California at Davis.\n\nSteve Leibson, Technology Evangelist, Tensilica Corporation.\n\n\"Component-Level Multimedia Function Blocks for Mobile SoC Designs.\"\n\nThis presentation provides the SOC designer and design manager with the technical details they need to incorporate digital multimedia codecs into their designs without first becoming codec experts. Such black-box design capabilities are increasingly important in a world of rapidly changing multimedia compression standards and constantly shrinking design schedules. Although video encoding and decoding are complex processes, Tensilicas family of preconfigured Diamond Audio and Video Engines simplifies the task for an SOC design team by acting as low-power black boxes that SOC designers can incorporate into their portable multimedia and handset chips without becoming H.264/AVC, MPEG-4, and digital-audio experts. Both the Diamond Video Engine and the Diamond Audio Engine, which is currently in volume production inside of multimedia and mobile-phone handset SOCs, illustrate how processors and ready-to-run firmware can form the core of a complex, high-performance, low-power IP block. None of the Diamond Audio and Video Engines internal operations are visible to the host processor, which is consistent with the IP blocks\n\nrole as component-level SOC building blocks. Hardware designs incorporating Tensilicas Diamond Audio and Video Engines are not complex. The engines, like the other system components, attach to the main system bus. In some designs, the Diamond HiFi 2 Audio Engine can also serve as the host processor. Predefined sets of API calls operate the Diamond Audio and Video Engines. The Diamond HiFi 2 Audio Engines software library includes a wide range of ready-to-run digital-audio codecs and, similarly, the Diamond Video Engine has a library of video codecs. Using this block-oriented approach to design, SOC development teams can rapidly assemble extremely complicated SOCs from complex, proven IP cores and then program these SOCs with application code to produce unique products for the market.\n\nBio: Steve Leibson is an experienced hardware and software design engineer, engineering manager, and design consultant.

Kissell, Principal Architect, MIPS Technologies,\n\n\"Considerations in Selecting Multicore and Multi-threaded Implementations.\"\n\nAbstract:\n\nTraditional frequency scaling is becoming less and less economical in todays SoC designs. Deeper pipelines require more logic, area, power to achieve higher frequencies in a given process. Multicore and multi-threaded designs offer viable alternatives for applications with suitable software models. But should you choose multi-threaded CPUs, multiple independent cores or even multiple multi-threaded cores? The solution depends on the application. This presentation will discuss the considerations for selecting the best solution, including flexibility, cache, task coordination and partitioning requirements, predictability of CPU requirements, hardware and software complexity, data sharing patterns, and cost/performance models. It will also include discussions of symmetric multi processing (SMP) and coherent multiprocessing (CMP) systems.\n\nBio: Kevin D.

Cost competitiveness is mainly driven by die size and ultimately yield. Die size and yield optimization are not new requirements to the semiconductor industry, but how these requirements have been addressed as compared to proposals for addressing future needs may slightly differ. Embedded memory IP can be a large component in the yield equation associated with SoC designs. Embedded memories in a SoC design can also be a facilitator to improving yield. State of the art design techniques as well as the intelligent use of redundancy are required to ensure high yielding memories. However, more often than not, issues arise in silicon and manifest themselves in embedded memories. Having the ability to quickly and easily locate the source of the silicon issue can be paramount to realizing aggressive yield targets. To enable quick and easy identification of silicon issues that typically manifest themselves in the embedded memory, designers must plan to incorporate an embedded memory test solution that can also be controlled through a tester to quickly and easily identify potential silicon issues.\n\nBio: Luigi Ternullo serves as Product Marketing Manager of Virage Logics STAR Memory System for embedded, on-chip test and repair of multi-megabit memories.

Carnegie Mellon University\n\nKeynote: \"From Wall Street to Silicon Valley: Using the Mathematics of Money and Risk for Fast Statistical IC Design\"\n\nMoore's law device scaling dramatically increases the statistical variability with which tomorrows chips must contend. Devices with atomic dimensions don't have deterministic parameters: every behavior we want to model is a messy smear of probability. How should we attack such problems? Is slow, expensive Monte Carlo analysis our only option? Is the silicon community unique in facing such problems? As it turns out, problems in computational finance and risk analysis share many of the characteristics that challenge us in statistical circuit analysis: high dimensionality, profound nonlinearity, stringent accuracy requirements, and expensive analysis (i.e., circuit simulation). In this talk I'll show examples of adapting computational ideas from Wall Street for use in the silicon world. I'll show how the same methods used to price complex securities can be adapted to compute silicon yields, giving speedups of 2x - 50x. I'll show how methods used to analyze the statistics of rare events (like the size of the biggest wave in a hurricane like Katrina) can be used to analyze failures in SRAM, giving speedups of 20,000x. Some of our best engineering students have found careers on Wall Street in recent years. Work such as this suggests that this \"brain drain\" need not be such a one-way thing.\n\nBIO: Rob A.

And these blocks and are being integrated into 65 nm and 45 nm CMOS SoCs and FPGA's. The multi-gigabit per second speed, complexity of the protocol, influence of the channel and variations in the deep sub-micron technology is resulting in new design challenges not only for the IP developer but also for the SoC integrator  in this case the consumer of the IP. Although equally skilled in design there are differences in the IP development and SoC integration tasks. The IP development team must ensure that they deliver all the necessary views for successful integration, without knowing in detail the SoC environment, and in most cases this involves thorough validation of functionality in the target foundry through test-chips. The SoC team must be able to integrate the IP and perform all the necessary chip-level verification. This is causing designers to re-think the verification and validation tasks of the IP. For example, pre-layout verification in terms of device mis-match and Monte Carlo simulations is becoming a poorer predictor of performance, increasing the importance of understanding the impact systematic variations based on physical changes to the device thereby necessitating detailed post-layout parasitic extracted simulations. Silicon test-chips where visibility into the link performance, supply/substrate noise rejection and ESD are the most important tasks required for validation. The necessary tasks of both the IP developer and integrator to ensure a fully functional SoC will be presented.\n\nBio: Navraj Nandra joined Synopsys in February 2005 as Director of Product Marketing for the mixed-signal products that include SERDES, USB and DDR2.

The latter issue, design efficiency, can be the single biggest contributor to \"cost\", which manifests itself in the forms of partial realization of power savings, schedule slips, and design failures.\n\nBio: Steve is a Vice President on the Cadence Synthesis team. In that role he is focused on marketing the solution for the best Quality-of-Silicon (chip speed, area, power, test measured after wires). Carlson reports to Chi-Ping Hsu, Corporate VP for New Synthesis at Cadence. Steve joined Cadence in April in 2003 via the Get2Chip acquisition, where he was the VP of Marketing. Prior to Get2Chip, Steve was the CEO of Tharas Systems, a hardware acceleration company. Steve has also held various management positions at Escalade, LSI Logic, United Technologies and Synopsys. At Synopsys, Steve was a part of the original Design Compiler technical team responsible for timing analysis and optimization. Steve was the author of the industrys first book on high-level design: Introduction to HDL-based Design Using VHDL. Steve has a BSEE, a BSCS, and an MSEE, all from the University of Colorado.\n\nBill Chown, Product Group Director for the System-Level Engineering Division at Mentor Graphics, Representing The SPIRIT Consortium.\n\n\"Design Flow integration with IP-XACT\"\n\nThe IP-XACT specifications provide machine-readable descriptions of IP to enable automated IP and SoC configuration, integration and verification in multi-vendor design flows. IP-XACT standardizes a meta-data format for IP description and assembly, in use to complete some of the industry's leading SoC devices. The applications of IP-XACT encompass the use of automated tools, generators and IP integration for synthesis, verification, documentation and other implementation flows, and span design configuration and integration requirements for RTL, ESL and advanced verification methodologies.\n\nBio: Bill Chown, currently a product group director for the system-level engineering division at Mentor Graphics, moved to the semiconductor industry with Intersil Semiconductors, where he went from designing mixed signal and DSP systems, at chip and board level in the UK, to managing projects through to layout and production test.

A twenty-five year veteran, Bill currently specializes in TLM and RTL platform-based design and verification. He has been involved with standards activities for several years, serving in the CFI, ECSI, and STIL initiatives, is past chair of the TTTC TAC on Virtual Test, is currently a member of the STIL working group, and is a board member for The SPIRIT Consortium and of OMG. Bill earned an Electronic Engineering degree from the University of Wales and an MBA from the University of Oregon.\n\nMike Thompson, Senior Engineering Manager, Actel Corporation.\n\n\"Portable Product Design with Cortex-M1 in Low-power FPGAs.\"\n\nThe increasing demand for portable products is forcing designers to look for ways to make applications run longer from finite battery resources. This is happening against the backdrop of shrink induced limitations to semiconductor physics resulting in increased leakage and changes to the traditional methods of controlling power consumption. At the same time products are becoming more complex with designers adding more features while dealing with rapidly changing markets and shortened design cycles driving the need for increased flexibility in the system platforms that they are using. By implementing battery powered applications with Flash FPGAs that offer sophisticated low power operating modes, designers can take advantage of the flexibility of programmable logic while developing products that maximize battery life. And, coupled with new state-of-the-art embedded soft processors like ARMs Cortex-M1 they can meet the increasing demand for performance while maximizing power efficiency. This presentation will look at the implementation of portable applications taking advantage of the capabilities offered by low power Flash FPGAs and the Cortex-M1 processor.\n\nBio: Mike Thompson is Senior Manager, IP & Applications Solution Marketing at Actel Corp. where he is responsible for the development and infrastructure support of new microprocessor IP cores for use in the companys FPGAs. He has more than 25 years of experience in both design and support of IP, microprocessors, microcontrollers and the development of embedded applications. He holds a BSEE from Northern Illinois University and an MBA from Santa Clara University. He is currently managing the release of Actels optimized version of the ARM Cortex-M1  the first ARM processor design specifically for implementation in FPGAs.\n\nSteve Leibson, Contributing Editor, EDN\n\nModerator\n\nBio: Steve Leibson is an experienced hardware and software design engineer, engineering manager, and design consultant. He spent 10 years working at electronic systems companies including HPs Desktop Computer Division, Auto-Trol Technology (graphics workstations), and Cadnetix (EDA workstations) after earning his BSEE cum laude from Case Western Reserve University. At HP, Auto-Trol, and Cadnetix, he specialized in the design of desktop computers and workstations, especially in the areas of system and I/O design.
