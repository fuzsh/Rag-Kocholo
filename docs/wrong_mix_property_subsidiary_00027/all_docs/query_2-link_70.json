I however was not notified of any licenses for political rallies, nor did I authorize such use.\" A YouTube representative said in an email Monday that the company \"removed the video in question for violating our harassment policy, which prohibits content targeting someone by suggesting they're complicit in a conspiracy theory used to justify real-world violence, such as QAnon.\" A Spotify representative said that \"the content in question was removed following an infringement claim....\"\n\nVan De Crommert said the uploads in question are identical to his and that he has no association with the account that put his music online alongside QAnon language. \"I do not align with the views of QAnon, and this individual has unlawfully distributed my music under their own name,\" he said.\n\nThe Post credits the song's morose strings for its impact, describing it as \"the kind of stock sentimental, algorithmically emotional pablum regularly employed to sell us trucks, insurance, petrochemicals, diapers, more trucks, pharmaceuticals, whole-grain bread and presidents.\""
