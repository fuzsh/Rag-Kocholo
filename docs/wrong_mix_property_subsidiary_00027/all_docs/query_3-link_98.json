Agenda EDA : Definition, current scenario Evolution of Electronics Generations of EDA Ist :1960s to 1980 II nd : Early 1980’s IIIrd : Late 1980’s to Today Events associated with EDA\n\n17. First Generation EDA Did Artwork Editing on customized workstation Business model focused on sale of workstations Customized hardware with complex software written mostly in assembly code.\n\n18. I st Gen EDA Company Calma 1965 a vendor of digitizers and minicomputer-based graphics systems GDS System in 1971, GDSII in 1978 GDS II Stream Format, a de facto standard for the interchange of IC mask information\n\n19. I st Gen EDA Company ComputerVision Early pioneer in turnkey Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM). It was founded in 1969 in USA. Its early products were built on a Data General Nova platform. CADDS-1 , was aimed at the printed circuit board layout and 2-D drafting markets. Starting around 1975, Computervision built its own Nova-compatible graphics processor using its own operating system. In the 1980s, it transitioned to Unix.\n\n20. I st Gen EDA Companies Applicon First vendor of Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems. It was founded in 1969 in USA. Their main product was called Bravo CAD/CAM. Zuken Inc It was established in 1976 in Japan Specialized in PCB In 1978 it released &quot;CREATE-2000&quot;(CR-2000) for PC (HP-1000 Platform) for PCB’s.\n\n21. Death of I st Gen EDA Companies Other than Zuken none of earlier EDA companies are alive today They were unable to keep abreast with technological changes Software porting problem Low sales volume Low Value perceived by Customers. Valuable but did not help in design portion.\n\n22. Agenda EDA : Definition, current scenario Evolution of Electronics Generations of EDA Ist :1960s to 1980 II nd : Early 1980’s IIIrd : Late 1980’s to Today Events associated with EDA\n\n23. II nd Gen EDA Design Automation Software was being developed in academia & large companies like Hewlett Packard, Tektronix, and Intel . 1981 marks beginning of EDA as industry Daisy Systems, Mentor Graphics, and Valid Logic Systems were all founded around this time, and collectively referred to as DMV\n\n24. II nd Gen EDA Company Daisy Systems Corporation Incorporated in 1981 in Mountain View, California Software and hardware for schematic capture, logic simulation, parameter extraction and other tools for Printed circuit board design and semiconductor chip layout. After merger with Cadnetics, it filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990 and was acquired by Intergraph in late 1990. Later spun off as an independent subsidiary named VeriBest, Inc\n\n25. II nd Gen EDA Company Valid System Valid built both hardware and software, for schematic capture, logic simulation, static timing analysis, and packaging. Later they expanded into IC and PCB layout. Valid ran schematic capture on a proprietary UNIX workstation, with static timing analysis, simulation, and packaging, running on a VAX or IBM-compatible mainframe Valid acquired several companies such as Telesis (PCB layout), Analog Design Tools, and Calma. Cadence Design Systems acquired Valid in 1991.\n\n26. II nd Gen EDA Company Mentor Graphics Founded in 1981 in Oregon, USA by software developers of Tektronix They decided to use “software-only” approach and ran all their programs on Apollo workstations. Their first product was IDEA 1000, which was, introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference.\n\n27. Death of II nd Gen EDA Companies Hardware sales were a substantial part of all three DMV companies By the mid-1980s, general-purpose workstations were powerful enough, plus they were much cheaper and could be used for other applications. Daisy & Valid were acquired while Mentor reinvented itself to focus on software\n\n28.

Agenda EDA : Definition, current scenario Evolution of Electronics Generations of EDA Ist :1960s to 1980 II nd : Early 1980’s IIIrd : Late 1980’s to Today Events associated with EDA\n\n39. HDL : Verilog Was designed and implemented by Phil Moorby at Gateway Design Automation in 1984-1985. The first major extension was Verilog-XL in 1986 In 1988, Synopsys delivered the first logic synthesizer, which used Verilog as an input language Cadence Design Systems acquired Gateway in December 1989, and continued to market Verilog as both a language and a simulator. Synopsys marketed the top-down design methodology, using Verilog.\n\n40. HDL : VHDL VHDL is the VHSIC Hardware Description Language. The development of VHDL was initiated in 1981 by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to address the hardware life cycle crisis. 1983-85 - Development of baseline language by Intermetrics, IBM and TI 1986 - All rights transferred to IEEE 1987 - Publication of IEEE Standard 1987 - Mil Std 454 requires VHDL descriptions to be delivered with ASICs 1994 - Revised standard (named VHDL 1076-1993)\n\n41. HDL War : Verilog/VHDL Verilog was a proprietary language owned by Cadence Other EDA put their weight behind VHDL, which was an open language. In 1991, Cadence officially published the Verilog language The most successful of Verilog simulators was VCS, the Verilog Compiled Simulator, from Chronologic Simulation. Accellera “ Adoption of VHDL was one of the biggest mistakes in the history of design automation, causing users and EDA vendors to waste hundreds of millions of dollars” Joe Costello\n\n42. Avant! litigation &quot;The Avant! case is probably the most dramatic tale of white-collar crime in the history of Silicon Valley&quot; . Avant! had a long legal battle(around 6 years) with Cadence Design System. In 1991 four Cadence employees left to form a competitive firm ArcSys later changed to Avant!. In 1994, Gerald Hsu, a senior Cadence executive resigned and joined Avant! as its new CEO. Shortly after Hsu’s departure, Avant! continued to hire many Cadence employees, including a number of critical programmers\n\n43. Avant! litigation Cadence engineer noticed that the Avanti code exactly reproduced a particular bug that Cadence code exhibited earlier. Cadence accused Avant! of misappropriating trade-secrets and other unlawful conduct. Cadence sued Avant! on several counts. At the end, the Avant! executives (Gerald Hsu and six others) paid about $195 million in restitution to Cadence with an additional $40+ million in fines personally to the State. During this litigation, Avant! was bought by Synopsys, which paid Cadence about $265 million dollars more to end all litigation\n\n44. Design Automation Conference (DAC) Combination of a technical conference and a trade show of EDA. DAC started 1964, and has been held yearly since. The first commercial DAC was held in June 1984. DAC is very popular; about 5500 people attended DAC in 2005. Other conferences are ICCAD (technical only, no trade show) Design and Test Europe (DATE) Asia South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASPDAC)\n\n45. Big Three : Merger and Acquisitions 1993 Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys and Mentor Graphics. These big companies have been able to sustain the Market share because of “Merger and Acquisitions”. Core and Acquired Revenue of Big Three\n\n46.
