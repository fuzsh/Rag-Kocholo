        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIt is cricket season in India. Be it Twenty20 or ODIs...cricket seems to be ruling the roost. And when employees are in a cricket frenzy, can corporates be far behind?\n\nIt is cricket season in India. Be it Twenty20 or ODIs...cricket seems to be ruling the roost. And when employees are in a cricket frenzy, can corporates be far behind? IT/ITES corporates are taking cricket seriously and organising games not only as team-building initiatives but also as CSR initiatives. And employees, mostly engineers, get to continue their love affair with the “gentleman’s game”.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\n“The IT industry has a lot of engineers. Several would have played cricket in school or college and would have stopped playing the game once they get jobs. Playing cricket with corporate teams gives them a chance to re-connect with the game,’’ says Dennis Deepak, IT consultant and Sports Ambassador of LogicaCMG.\n\nAgrees Mukul Mathur, finance manager, Cadence, who says, “the enjoyment of being involved as a player stems from the fact that you represent your company in an activity that you immensely enjoy. Cricket is a passion with most of us. What makes it doubly satisfying is that all this is done for a great cause.’’\n\nCadence Design Systems has been holding its CRY Cadence Corporate Cricket Challenge (5Cs) for the last eight years to create awareness and sensitise people towards child rights in India. This is an all-India event with matches in Delhi, Chandigarh, Bangalore and London. According to Saurabh N Dubey, technical specialist (technology and practices), Microland India, Bangalore has many cricket tournaments where IT/ITES companies take part.\n\nThese include the likes of the TNT Cup, Pride Cup and PTL Cup. Some companies which have regular teams include Genpact, LogicaCMG, Infosys, Accenture, Microsoft, Satyam, HCL, Sasken Communications, Honeywell, Philips etc. Matches take place during weekends and normally are of 25 overs per side. Tournaments differ in duration — for instance, the PTL Cup held in April had 12 teams and lasted for one and a half months.\n\nThese cricket tournaments are taken seriously by the teams, says Mr Deepak, who is also the captain of the LogicaCMG cricket team which won the PTL Cup this year. “LogicaCMG has 25-30 people in the team who practice almost every weekend at Ulsoor ground. We participate in two or three tournaments every year. While we don’t have a coach, we follow discipline in practice, have team talks, strategy sessions on how we can improve etc,’’ he adds.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nBudget Highlights: Your 2-minute guide\n\nTax tweaks, jobs & more: All that FM announced in Budget\n\nFM 's plan for Viksit Bharat: A look at key numbers\n\nAccording to Mr Dubey, the Microland team might not practice every week but has certainly seen huge success in tournaments with a success rate of 60-65%. “The team has people who had played cricket in school or college and people who have not had any exposure to cricket. Infact, our captain is a former zonal and district-level player.” He feels that the reason IT corporates encourage their teams is because it is a team game which promotes team building and is popular.\n\nAnd if you think only a few people from these companies get to play the unofficial national game of India, then you’re wrong. Several companies have internal cricket tournaments along with other sports. These are annual events and see the particpation of employees from across units and locations. For instance, LogicaCMG holds a competition over a day in March which has 32 teams from the company under various names like Gray Indians, Googly Greens, Roaring Reds. Each team also has two women playing for it and takes part in six-over matches.\n\nThe runners-up in recently-held tournaments like Pride Cup and PTL Cup, Genpact has its own version of Olympics called Thrilympics which is a multi-discipline event. Cricket is an integral part of the event, which includes a customised version of T20 cricket.\n\n#Budget 2024 with ET\n\nWhat's cheaper and what's costlier?
