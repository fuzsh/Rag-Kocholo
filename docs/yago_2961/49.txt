The grand and astonishing Temple of the Emerald Buddha, one of the most beautiful temples in the world, is situated in the area of Rattanakosin Island, the historic part of Bangkok. Wat Phra Kaew was established in the year 2325 of the Buddhist calendar (1782 AD) when King Rama I, the first monarch of the Chakri Dynasty, also known as King Buddha Yodfa Chulalok, chose to build the temple, the Grand Palace, and the city of Bangkok simultaneously. Wat Phra Kaew served as the residence of Thai kings from the first to the fifth reigns and was part of the Grand Palace. It also houses the revered Emerald Buddha, or Phra Kaew Morakot, and remains a significant place for royal ceremonies and religious practices in the present day.

Though the Grand Palace may not have resident monks or regular religious activities like other temples, simply taking a stroll to admire the exquisite architecture and artwork both inside and outside the temple is enough to immerse yourself in Thai art and culture. The temple walls are adorned with mural paintings depicting historical stories, offering a feast for the eyes and a glimpse into the past. Moreover, these fine artworks have been continuously restored by artists from various eras, adding a timeless touch of contemporary beauty that keeps visitors fascinated without ever getting bored.

Apart from the Grand Palace itself, visitors can also walk over to explore other nearby tourist attractions, such as Wat Pho (Temple of the Reclining Buddha), Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn), or cross the river to visit Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchaworamahawihan, and many more.
