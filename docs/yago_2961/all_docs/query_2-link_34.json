        "text": "At the end of Yaowaraj Road,As this location is quite close to the Chinatownhotel, so that you can reach there by walking within 5 minutes only near Bangkok's Hualamphong Railway Station,Wat Traimit is a temple situated on Traimit Road. This temple is known for its famous Golden Buddha.\n\nChinatown Heritage Center is a museum in Wat Traimit Temple that traces the lives and times of early Chinatown and memories and untold stories of Siam.\n\nThe Emergence Of Bangkok's Chinatown (1782-1851)\n\nIn ancient times, Chinese traders traveling by junk from their homeland came to settle in many parts of the Thai kingdom, such as in Bangkok, or Thonburi, where the Ayuttha Era. Son of a Teochew Chinese father, King Taksin the Great established Thonburi as the new capital. During his reign, a large number of Teochews came to settle here and formed a new Chinese community east of the river.\n\nIn 1782, King Buddha Yodfa Chulalok the Great, or Rama 1, relocated the capital city to the east bank and founded Rattanakosin. As a result, he had the local Chinese residents relocated to another area on the river bank south of the city and allotted them land to settle between Wat Sam Pluem and Wat Sampheng canals. The first three regions of Rattanakosin Period saw quite a rapid growth of Sampheng Chinese labor force was encouraged for various types of employment. The majority of the newly arrived sought to settle down in Sampheng before moving to other places where better prospects could be located.\n\nJunk Trade\n\nJunk trade with China was the main source of State Godown acted as goods collector as well as sole holder of state monopoly on foreign trade, although the office had to reply solely on the Chinese who supervised the complete cycle of operation ranging from navigation to contact with trade partners in China.\n\nThai Exports\n\nThai Exports in those days mainly included forest as well as agricultural products, along with junks built in Thailand from quality but inexpensive wood.\n\nChinese Goods\n\nGoods from China which were in demand during this period were mostly processed goods meant for members of both the upper class and the general public.\n\nUnbleached cloth; silk; satin; black cloth\n\nPorcelain\n\nPaper; fan; umbrella; item for sacrificial offering\n\nDried and preserved vegetable and fruit; tea;medicine\n\nFlooring rock; roof tile; stone statue\n\nRed-bow Junks:From Motherland to Siam\n\nChaozhou or Teochew Prefecture in Northern Guangdong Province was where Sino-Thai trade was at the strongest in early Rattanakosin period. Janglin in Tenghai District was the main port of call for both Thai and Chinese cargo ships. As the bows of the latter leaving Janglin Port were painted in red, they were called re-bow junks. Aside from cargo, they also carried large numbers of passengers hoping to find jobs in Siam(Thailand). Having heard much talk about Thailand’s fertility and persuaded by relatives who had taken the trip, young men from poverty-stricken villages of Teochew and nearby prefectures came aboard these on the south route toward Thailand.\n\nWhile the hold of the ships were full of cargo, each passenger on the deck had only a few pieces of belongings, mostly a mat, a bamboo pillow, a straw hat and a water jar. The food he brought along mainly consisted of steamed Chinese pastry, which nicely kept for several days and ash-pumpkins which were refreshing in lieu of water and could also be used as lifebuoy in case of shipwreck. The voyage from Janglin to Bangkok took about one mount, during which the passenger could do almost nothing except pray that God bless them with a safe journey and let them emerge unscathed from all kinds of danger stemming from a potential storm, famine or disease while at sea.\n\nMooring at Sampheng : The first Step on New Land\n\nJunks from China arrived in Bangkok sometime between January and April. Foreign ships could get as close to the capital as possible while mooring in Sampheng area which lay adjacent to the southern city wall. The river in this area buzzed with an open market atmosphere on deck of these junks. A certain part of cargo was transported to shops in Sampheng. Bangkok's biggest market which featured a dense cluster of Chinese-owned houses and shops. House and house-boats belonging to Chinese merchants were along the bank of the river.\n\nLarge numbers of Chinese passengers disembarked here.Those arriving in Thailand for the first time relied on help from relatives or acquaintances hailing from the same villages as they struggled to settle to settle in the new land.Many found jobs in Sampheng working as coolies or earning a living as peddlers before changing to other occupations at a later stage.\n\nThe Shine : A Spiritual Refuge for the Chinese Community\n\nThe sheine is regarded as the house of god of the community wherever the Chinese come to settle. Sampheng is no different. The sacred shrine here is the Lao Pun Thao Kong Shrine, or the Old Shrine, situated on the river bank. According to the Teochews, Pun Thao Kong is the senior god who looks after the welfare of all in the community is behind everyone's success and prosperity and protects him from all ills. They always pay homage to the god while seeking his blessings. The shrine servers as a spiritual refuge to the Chinese living miles away from their homeland. Supposedly, it had used to be just a small one but has become bigger with the growth of the community, playing the role of a spiritually unifying entity that helps strengthening social relations with the community.\n\nBrass Shop\n\nThai-Style household item made of brass include a bowl with supporting stand ladle, serving tray, candlestick and betel tray. Most of them were produced by the Chinese, as evidenced the Chinese-owned brassware shops in Sampheng. Besides, the fact that in those days a lot of Chinese merchants had Thai wives helped ease trade bragains with their Thai counterparts.\n\nGrocer's Shop\n\nGroceries available in Sampheng area included Chinese dried or preserved food, fresh fruits imported from China which were very expensive in those days, plus items necessary for the Chinese lifestyle, e.g. those for sacrificial offering, paper lantern and lamp. These were originally imported mainly to satisfy the demand on the part of Chinese customers as well.\n\nNoodle Peddler\n\nMade from rice flour, a noodle dish features noodles, soup and a variety of relish. Introduced by the Teochews, noodle dishes became very popular in Thailand. Many among the newly arrived become noodle peddlers walking the streets with \"the shop\" carried on the shoulders. In those days, customers used to provide their own bowls.\n\nPorcelain Shop\n\nPorcelain made up a large portion of imports from China during early Rattanakosin period. Some items were customers-made to meet orders from noble families while others were meant for general consumers, as locally made porcelain was still of a lower quality. Besides porcelain, these shops also carried expensive imports from China such as glassware and silk fabric.\n\nSampheng:Bangkok's Biggest Market In Early Rattanakosin Period\n\nDuring the early Rattanakosin period,Sampheng was the only densely populated community outside the city wall. The only \"road\" outside the city wall was the Sampheng alleyway, a narrow, 800-meter walker way stretching from Saphan Han Gate and lined solely by shop and houses owned by the Chinese, Still, It was the biggest and busiest trade district of Bangkok from where Chinese goods were distributed and where Thailand's Exports awaiting shipment were collected. Beside, It was a popular retail market for Bangkok consumers looking for a wide variety of favorite goods ranging from foodstuff to everyday commodity among both Thais and Chinese. Also found in Sampheng were entertainment house such as gambling dens and 'green lantern house'(brothels). As it happened, repeated incidents of fire occurred in Sampheng where dense rows of house and buildings featuring Chinese architecture were located.\n\nWeaver of Chinese Paper Lantern\n\nPaper lantern was used both as household and ceremonial item.Thus, a Chinese community never lacked those who earned a living weaving paper lantern, besides painting letters on it. The kind meant for hanging in front of a shop usually bore the shop's name in red while the kind used at a funeral bore blue letters. An ally in Sampheng called Trok Rong Khom (Lantern Factory Alley) was an area of predominantly paper lantern manufacturing.\n\nToward the Golden Age (1851-1957)\n\nDuring the period of more than a century ever since the introduction of steamship, the rapid growth of the Chinese community in Sampheng was proportional to the number of those newly arrived. It eventually saw a new main road, Yaowarat, which soon became the heart of a vast business area as well as Bangkok's most modern entertainment outlets for the period around 1957.Thus, the name \"Yaowarat\" came to mean the entire Chinatown of Bangkok.\n\nThe thriving business around Yaowarat Road could be principally attributed to two factors: the government's policy of accelerated city development under western influence and the Chinese' capability to adjust to the modern form of economy, namely the free trade scheme, which coincided with the introduction of steamship by westerners. Chinese merchants were fast getting familiar with the new opportunities opening up s they relied on their intrinsic element called perseverance in order to attain success in operating commercial enterprises starting with rice trade - Thailand's No.1 export being rice - before diversifying into an array of other businesses, thereby securing strength and solid foundation to the Thai modern economy centered at Yaowarat.\n\nYaowarat Road: The New Look of Bangkok's Chinatown\n\nOne of the 18 new roads in the project to promote the trading business centering in Sampheng District which was submitted for approval from King Rama 4 by the Ministry of Public Works, Yaowarat Road was first constructed in 1892 in the area originally densely populated by the Chinese. The community had been in poor surroundings amidst numerous badly littered, dirty and untidy-looking alley-ways situated between Charoen Krung(New Road) and Sampheng Roads. The construction of Yaowarat Road 1,532 meters long and merely 20 meters wide, took altogether eight years. To comply with the king's policy, the road followed a meandering course so as to avoid the existing cluster of houses. It was also following his initiation that rows of modern shop-house were built along the road for rent to traders, thereby opening up an opportunity for a great number of Chinese to start their own businesses.
