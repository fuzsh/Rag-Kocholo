        "text": "Somdet Phra Bawornrajchao Maha Senanurak (Thai: สมเด็จพระบวรราชเจ้ามหาเสนานุรักษ์; March 29, 1773 - July 16, 1817) was the Front Palace appointed by Buddha Loetla Nabhalai as the titular heir to the throne as he was the brother to the king. Maha Senanurak was known for his leadership of Siamese campaign against Burmese invasion of Thalang (Phuket) in 1809.\n\nLife\n\nChui was born to Chao Phraya Chakri (future King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke or Rama I) and his wife Nak (future Queen Amarindra) in 1773. In 1782, Chao Phraya Chakri crowned himself as the first monarch of the Chakri dynasty of Siam at Bangkok. Chui was then made a prince. He was later awarded the title Krom Khun Senanurak. Prince Senanurak was known to be close to his only true brother Prince and Front Palace Isarasundhorn (future Buddha Loetla Nabhalai or Rama II).[1] In 1807 Prince Isarasundhorn made his brother Prince Senanurak as his Successor to the Front Palace (Thai: พระบัณฑูรน้อย). In 1809, King Buddha Yodfa Chulalok died, as a result the Front Palace Isarasundhorn ascended the throne as King. The new King appointed Prince Senanurak as the next the Front Palace and Vice King, and also as his successor.\n\nSoon after in 1809, King Bodawpaya of Burma sent his troops to invade Thalang or modern Phuket. Buddha Loetla Nabhalai sent Maha Senanurak to counter this last Burmese invasion of Siam.\n\nAround the same time Prince Kasatranuchit, a son of King Taksin of Thonburi and his sister Princess Chimyai, staged a rebellion to reclaim the throne. The rebellion was quickly suppressed by Prince Jessadabodindra (future King Rama III). Maha Senanurak's wife, Princess Samleewan, a daughter of Taksin, was executed for treason.\n\nDeath\n\nFront Palace Maha Senanurak fell ill and died in 1817. For the rest of his reign King Rama II refused to appoint a new Front Palace, leading perhaps to the brief confusion in succession between his sons Jessadabodindra and Mongkut at his death in 1824.\n\nReferences\n\n^ http://www.bloggang.com/mainblog.php?id=rattanakosin225&month=19-09-2007&group=1&gblog=35\n\nMaha Senanurak\n\nChakri Dynasty\n\nBorn: 29 March 1773 Died: 16 July 1817 Preceded by\n\nIsarasundhorn Front Palace\n\n1809–1817 Succeeded by\n\nMaha Sakdi Polsep\n\nRattanakosin Period (1782-1932) Monarchs Individuals Key events\n\nChakri Dynasty\n\nKings\n\nBuddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I)\n\nBuddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II)\n\nJessadabodindra (Rama III)\n\nMongkut (Rama IV)\n\nChulalongkorn (Rama V)\n\nVajiravudh (Rama VI)\n\nPrajadhipok (Rama VII)\n\nVice Kings\n\nMaha Sura Singhanat\n\nMaha Senanurak\n\nMaha Sakdi Polsep\n\nPinklao\n\nBovorn Vichaichan\n\nRear Palace\n\nAnurak Devesh\n\nRoyalty\n\nDevavongse\n\nDamrong Rajanubhab\n\nChakrabongse Bhuvanadh\n\nParibatra Sukhumbhand\n\nSupreme Council of State of Siam\n\nSiamese\n\nSunthorn Phu\n\nBodindecha\n\nPrayurawongse\n\nSi Suriyawongse\n\nKhana Ratsadon\n\nForeigners\n\nDan Beach Bradley\n\nJean-Baptiste Pallegoix\n\nAnna Leonowens\n\nJohn Bowring\n\nGustave Rolin-Jaequemyns\n\nAuguste Pavie\n\nKey events\n\nFoundation of Bangkok\n\nTây Sơn-Siam War\n\nNine Armies War\n\nTa Din Dang campaign\n\nTavoy expedition\n\nInvasion of Thalang\n\nCrawfurd Mission\n\nCambodian Rebellion (1811-1812)\n\nRebellion of Anouvong\n\nBurney Treaty\n\nSiamese-Vietnamese War (1831-1834)\n\nSiamese–Vietnamese War (1841–1845)\n\nBowring Treaty\n\nFront Palace crisis\n\nHaw wars\n\nIncident of 103\n\nFranco-Siamese War\n\nPaknam incident\n\nAnglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909\n\nPalace Revolt of 1912\n\nSiam during World War I\n\n1924 Palace Law of Succession\n\nSiamese revolution of 1932\n\nHistory of Thailand (1932–1973)"
