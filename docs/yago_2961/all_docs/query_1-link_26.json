        "meta_description": "This essay discusses relations between the Kingdoms of Siam and Italy, 1900–1930, focusing on the central role played by Italian architects and engineers in the introduction of European building knowledge and techniques in Siam. The general context is the extensively described phenomenon of “cultivated emigration” involving a significant segment of the European professionals working abroad in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In this particular case, however, we have examined Italian expatriates in South East Asia. Several researchers have published papers on the subject in recent years, but a thorough framework for the study has yet to be set up. The perspective chosen for the article is European. In addition to housing the source of the research, Europe is first and foremost where the building culture expressed by the projects analyzed here was forged and understood. In this article, we do not deal directly with the complex problem of the encounter between the Italian and Siamese building cultures. Instead, we have tracked the export to Siam of two European construction techniques (reinforced concrete and metal structure, especially as applied to bridge construction), emphasizing the contribution provided by Italian architects and engineers.",

        "text": "Introduction: topics and sources\n\n2On the one hand, it is true that attention to bridge construction involves tracing the various stages of the transition from traditional wooden constructions to those in reinforced concrete with metal structures. However, the aim of this work is to study this transition for what it reveals of the problems connected with the processes of adaptation to the colonial context, the relationships between the proponents of change, and the various forms of competition between companies. As a result, the researchers were confronted by the problem of the dispersion of both public archives (in Italy, France, and Thailand) and private archives (those of businesses and professionals). The sources investigated demanded constant analysis and cross interpretation between different forms of “writing”: technical reports drafted by contractors, correspondence with engineers, articles in journals, technical reports and celebratory texts presented during exhibitions, dispatches from diplomats, and mechanisms for recruiting skilled technicians and professionals.\n\n3We are aware that the scholar attempting to reconstruct the history of a construction site inevitably faces the fragmentation of the sources (including some gaps that can never be filled). Interpretation leads to conjecture that may never be fully resolved. However, this study observes the construction site as the nexus of a close-knit and complex network of relationships, skills, and cultures, intervening to design its specificity.\n\nWestern technique in the face of the uncertain balance between Siam and foreign powers\n\n5In addition to its uniqueness as a monument, from a technical point of view, due to the complexity of the problems tackled during its construction, the Throne Hall project was valuable as an essential experience. It may have influenced decisions made by Maison Hennebique in the construction of reinforced-concrete works in the years immediately after the Throne Hall was edified. More generally, Bangkok, built on unstable, marshy land at 1.50 meters below sea level, is repeatedly subject to the risk of flooding. Such difficulties offered Western contractors and engineers a broad spectrum of opportunities for experimentation. Likewise, the capital and provinces were characterized by a network of canals, so many bridges were necessary. These works became one of the architectural subjects most commonly used to showcase technical and technological virtuosity, made even more impressive by the difficult soil conditions. From 1894, to strengthen the centrality of this design theme, Rama V introduced the construction of the capital’s bridges into the plans for the celebration of the King’s birthday and the kingdom’s anniversaries. The last great span, the Memorial Bridge, was opened in 1932, just before the revolution and the exile of the king.\n\nThe introduction of reinforced concrete in Bangkok: an Italian-French connection by Francesca B. Filippi\n\n7Employment of Italian professionals in Siamese government offices reached a peak during the construction of the Royal Palace in Dusit Park. Positioned centrally in relation to the urban transformation projects underway in Bangkok and surrounded with a quadrangular fence, the park was a monumental complex. It consisted of a pavilion amid lawns and landscaping, crossed by canals and bridges connecting the Throne Hall to the other buildings. The languages of Western architecture dominated inside the Dusit, while outside the monumental Phra Lan (or Royal Plaza) was exalted by the Beaux-Arts-inspired layout of the streets, connecting to majestic Ratchadamnoen Avenue. The latter was dominated by the equestrian statue of Rama V and by the impressive Carrara marble mass of the southern facade of the Throne Hall.\n\n8Starting in 1907, architect Mario Tamagno studied designs for the Throne Hall several times before defining the classical version inspired by Italian renaissance and baroque architecture in cooperation with architect Annibale Rigotti, summoned from Italy specifically to work on the project. The building, developed according to a rectangular plan measuring 100 × 46 meters, was clad and decorated entirely with Carrara marble, surmounted by seven domes and semi-domes covered with gilded copper and bronze. The dome above the throne room reaches a height of over 40 meters and weighs an approximate total of 1,500 tons. The main structure, designed by the Department’s engineers, is mixed, with reinforced concrete foundations and domes and brick walls. Due to the site chosen for Dusit Park (on particularly fragile soils once occupied by a paddy field) and the excessive weight of the Hall and its marble cladding, the construction of the foundations immediately proved to be an extremely complex and challenging operation. When the attempt at building brick foundations failed, engineers Carlo Allegri and Emilio Giovanni Gollo decided to contact the bureau central of the French company, Hennebique, for the project.\n\n12In Siam, experimentation with reinforced concrete technique was also being applied to road and bridge construction. In the decades between the 1890s and 1920s, these public works became one of the symbols of the country’s modernization. In honor of the Siamese participation in the International Exhibition held in Turin in 1911, Carlo Allegri boasted of the projects supervised by Italians working for the Siamese Public Works Department. The list included: 120 km of roads in the capital and 500 km of roads in the country, 100 bridges in Bangkok “made of wood, masonry, iron, and reinforced concrete, eight to 16 meters wide, five to 24 meters of span” and 200 bridges throughout the country “made of wood or reinforced concrete, three to eight meters wide, five to 180 meters of span.” Although Italians consistently played a role in the construction of the infrastructures, their participation was limited to the works carried out by the Ministry of Public Works. After the 1890s reform of government organization that resulted in the creation of ministries on the Western model, the responsibility for civil works was shared between the Ministry of Public Works—who managed Post and Telegraphs, Railways, and Public Works—and the Sanitation Department, a branch of the Ministry of Agriculture until 1907. The latter was in charge of road and bridge construction. In 1912, the reorganization of the construction sector led to a new division of responsibilities between the Ministry of Ways and Communications, the Department of Fine Arts (Ministry of the Royal House), and the Construction Department (Ministry of Capital). In the regrouping of roles, the Sanitation Department remained under French influence, while the Italians were the undisputed makers and doers at Public Works. The two departments were assigned different types of structures. This division of duties seemed to correspond to a distinction between works with monumental or representative aims (Public Works) and those for purely infrastructural purposes (Sanitation Department). The success of Italians in Siam was closely connected to the skills they demonstrated as stylists, bred by a culture of eclecticism exported beyond Europe at the turn of the nineteenth-century. Several examples of bridges built to Italian designs are still standing. Many are in wrought iron, and in Dusit Park, there are still some red iron footbridges stamped with the “Larini Nathan & C.” trademark (figs. 3 and 4).\n\n13Considerable opportunities for further experimentation seemed to be available in the early 1900s with the design of several wooden bridges outside Bangkok. These projects were supervised by engineer Edmondo Roberti di Castelvero, another graduate in civil engineering from the School of Application for Engineers in Turin (fig. 5).\n\nThe Società Nazionale Officine Savigliano and the Italian contribution to the introduction of metal construction in Siam by Vilma Fasoli\n\n26The containing walls along the river supported a system of terraces which housed viaducts, connecting ramps, and gardens, and compensated for the differences in height between the bridge and the city streets. On the eastern side, in particular, the plan to erect a statue of King Rama I necessitated the incorporation of a large square, monumental staircase, and terraced gardens into the accesses to the bridge (fig. 18)"
