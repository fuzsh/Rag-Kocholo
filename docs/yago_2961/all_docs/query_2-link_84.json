        "text": "First part of a Thai language course, which was originally designed for NHA Open University at Panningen, the Netherlands. The course has subsequently been improved and adapted by the author for Thai language instruction to foreign students at Prince of Songkla University, Phuket Campus, Thailand.\n\nPunjabi, a largely South Asian spoken language, is very rich in reduplication but less researched language in the linguistic circle of Pakistan. It ranges from total/full reduplication to different types of partial reduplication such as alternation of vowel based morpheme, alternation of consonant based morpheme, and rhyme with diminutive suffix and/or echoic expressions. The study discusses five major points: 1) Reduplication with reference to its classifications and semantics. 2) Reduplication of nonsense/empty words in contrast to Keane’s (2005). 3) Variation in the position of reduplicants 4) Challenges Abbi’s (1985) claim that pre/postpositions of any language may not be reduplicated 5) Gives an example, contra Abbi (1985), in which the meaning of reduplicated and non-reduplicated forms overlap each other. The study displays that partial reduplication is responsible for forming new compound words and performs a variety of different semantic functions."
