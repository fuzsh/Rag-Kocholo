        "text": "The Growth of the Chinese Population in Thailand\n\nChina and Thailand have a long history of cultural and economic exchange, which has led to significant Chinese influence in Thailand. Here is an outline of some of the key areas where Chinese influence is seen in Thailand:\n\nLanguage: The Thai language has many loanwords from Chinese, especially from the Teochew, Hokkien, and Cantonese dialects. Some of the most commonly used Chinese loanwords in Thai include \"kao\" (rice), \"nam\" (water), and \"mee\" (noodles).\n\nReligion: Buddhism is the predominant religion in Thailand, and Chinese Mahayana Buddhism has also had a significant influence. Chinese temples, such as the Wat Mangkon Kamalawat in Bangkok, are found throughout the country and are popular places of worship for Thai-Chinese communities.\n\nFood: Chinese cuisine has had a significant impact on Thai food, with many Thai dishes being adaptations of Chinese dishes. For example, pad Thai, one of the most popular Thai dishes, is believed to have been inspired by the Chinese dish chow mein.\n\nCustoms and traditions: Chinese customs and traditions are also evident in Thai culture. For example, the Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is celebrated in Thailand with dragon and lion dances, firecrackers, and red decorations.\n\nTrade and commerce: China has been an important trading partner for Thailand for centuries, and Chinese merchants have played a significant role in the country's economy. Today, Chinese investment in Thailand is growing, and the two countries have signed numerous trade agreements.\n\nArts and crafts: Chinese art, particularly ceramics and porcelain, has had a significant influence on Thai art. Thai celadon pottery, for example, was inspired by Chinese celadon, and Thai silk textiles are often decorated with Chinese-inspired designs.\n\nOverall, the Chinese influence in Thailand is significant and diverse, touching many aspects of Thai culture, from language and religion to food and art.\n\nPhra Pok Klao Bridge\n\nPhra Pok Klao Bridge was built in 1982 on the 200th anniversary of Rattanakosin or Bangkok nowadays. Spahan Taksin and that bridge also was opened in 1982 to celebrate the 200th anniversary. The bridge was designed to alleviate traffic congestion on the adjacent Memorial Bridge. The bridge is composed of three viaducts, with the central viaduct designed to carry future mass transit links. The bridge was named after King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) who is most notably was the last absolute monarch and also the only Siamese monarch of the Chakri Dynasty to abdicate. In 2020, the central viaduct that used to be the structure of the failed Lavalin Skytrain project was converted into a sky park, and will be considered as the first sky park in Southeast Asia.\n\nChao Phraya Sky Park\n\nChao Phraya Sky Park สวนลอยฟ้าเจ้าพระยา is an elevated, linear park in Bangkok, built on the central was the site of the construction of the Lavalin Skytrain project, which was the first electric train line of Bangkok and the construction contract was signed in 1990, but after only 2 years, Lavalin Company was facing financial problems until the project had to be abandoned leaving only the bridge. Subsequently, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has teamed up with the Urban Design and Development Center (UDDC), as well as the Office of the Health Promotion Fund and Chulalongkorn University to renovate the remains of this abandoned viaduct to be a public park in the middle of the river. It was originally named Phra Prajadhipok Bridge Sky Park, however, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration organized a contest to re-name this park in the middle of the river and the name that won the contest was \"Chao Phraya Sky Park\" and officially opened on June 25, 2020.\n\nThe Memorial Bridge\n\nOpened on 6 April 1932, by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Chakri Dynasty and the foundation of Bangkok, shortly before the Siamese coup d'état of 24 June 1932. In English the bridge is commonly known as Memorial Bridge, however in Thai, it is most commonly known as Phra Phuttayotfa Bridge สะพานพระพุทธยอดฟ้า, after King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I), the first king of the Chakri Dynasty. The name is more commonly shortened as Saphan Phut สะพานพุทธ or Phut Bridge.\n\nMemorial Bridge was the first road bridge built across the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok. The very first bridge built across the Chao Phraya River had been the Rama VI Bridge, opened in 1927. This was a railway and pedestrian bridge designed to allow the Southern Line railway to be extended across the river and terminate at Hua Lampong Station together with the Northern Line). In 1928 the Siamese government initiated an international competitive tender for this landmark bridge that was planned to commemorate both the founding of Bangkok and the 150th anniversary of the Chakri dynasty. The key requirements laid out in the tender were that the bridge should not interfere in river navigation and that it should be monumental in nature as befitting such an important commemoration.\n\nThe winning tender came from Dorman Long & Co. Ltd, a prestigious British company who were famous for their steel bridges erected across the world. Their most famous work is the Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia which was opened just three weeks prior to Bangkok’s Memorial Bridge.\n\nDorman Long’s design was for a three span steel bridge that is 7.5 metres above the river to allow river navigation for larger vessels the central span comprised two lifting bascule sections that when raised provided a 60 metre wide opening for shipping.\n\nAt each end of the bridge ornamental gardens were to be built, the centre piece for which on the Bangkok side a large statue of King Phra Phuttayotfa (Rama I) was built. A subtle feature in these plans was that the layout of the bridge, roads and gardens form the shape of an arrow shooting across the Chao Phraya River, the arrow being the emblem of King Prajadhipok (Rama VII).\n\nThe official opening was organised for Chakri Day, 6th April 1932, the 150th anniversary of the founding of Bangkok. King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) presided over the opening ceremony where the focal point was the large statue of an enthroned King Phra Phuttayotfa (Rama I). This statue had been designed by the famous Italian artist based in Siam, Corrado Feroci (Silpa Bhirasri) whilst the setting was designed by Prince Naris, a son of King Mongkut (Rama IV).\n\nLess than three months later King Rama VII was deposed by a group of civilians and military officers who called themselves The People’s Party. The opening of Memorial Bridge was the last major public engagement of King Rama VII in his role of Absolute Monarch.\n\nDuring World War II, when Japan occupied Thailand, On 5th June 1944, some 77 or more B29 Superfortress bombers were sent to destroy both the bridge and the power station, a test for the Americans of their bombing skills before attacks began on Japan. In the event neither target was hit, the bombs being over two kilometres off-target and destroying a Japanese hospital as well as the headquarters of the Japanese secret police. Ironically, because by chance no civilian buildings were hit, the Thai authorities were impressed by the apparent accuracy of the American bombing. Nevertheless, Memorial Bridge was eventually hit and partially destroyed by Allied bombs in a raid on April 14th, 1945.\n\nAfter the end of World War 2 it was four years before Memorial Bridge was restored to operation. The re-opening of the bridge took place with great festivity on 14th November 1949. As the Bangkok Post reported the next day “Thousands gathered at the approaches to the bridge to witness the fanfare. Prince Rangsit of Chainat pressed a button causing the centre parts of the bridge to swing into a closed position, as planes flew overhead dropping flowers……..the party continued into the night”.\n\nThe King Rama I Monument\n\nThe King Rama I Monument, otherwise called the royal statue of Phrabat Somdet Phra Phutthayod Chulalok, was enshrined at the feet of Pathom Barommarachanuson Bridge on Bangkok side. Before the commemoration of the 150-year anniversary of Krung Rattanakosin in 1932, King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) suggested constructing a permanent structure as the memorial of the first king of Krung Rattanakosin. Accordingly, the king mentioned his desire to the government and the consensus became clear that the construction of the memorial was to be completed in order to commemorate his grace and honour and that the first bridge across the Chao Phraya was built at the same time. King Rama VII presided over the opening of the monument on 6 April 1932. The statue imitates the King in his full costume seated on the throne with his hands on the sword on his laps. Professor Silp Peerasri from Silpakorn University sculpted and moulded the statue by bronze. A white elephant facing the hoist, the symbol of Chakri Dynasty, is carved in the middle of the stone.\n\nThe Story: King Rama I\n\nPhra Phutthayotfa Chulalok Maharaj, also known as Rama I, was the founder of the Rattanakosin Kingdom and the first monarch of the reigning Chakri dynasty of Siam. He ascended the throne in 1782, following the deposition of King Taksin of Thonburi. He was also celebrated as the founder of Rattanakosin (now Bangkok) as the new capital of the reunited kingdom.\n\nIn 1781, he went on the campaigns against Cambodia, only to return prematurely due to the instability of Thonburi. The rebellion of Phraya Sun had broken out and the rebels deposed King Taksin. After arriving in Thonburi in 1782, Chao Phraya defeated the Phraya Sun with his forces and eventually executed the ousted Taksin and also executed Phraya Sun. He then seized power and made himself King, establishing the Chakri Dynasty, which continues to rule Thailand to this day.\n\nGeneral Maha Kasatsuek crowned himself on 6 April 1782. Soon after, he decided to move the capital of Siam to the east bank of the Chao Phraya river for several reasons, including its better strategic location and a desire to promote his legitimacy by starting from a clean slate. He decided to name his new capital \"Rattanakosin\" (\"Keeping place of the Emerald Buddha\").\n\nCOLONIAL PERIOD GROWTH - King Rama I & the Chinese 1782 - 1851\n\nModern Chinatown now covers a large area around Yaowarat and Charoen Krung Road. It has been the main centre for trading by the Chinese community since they moved from their old site to make way for the construction of Wat Phra Kaew, the Grand Palace.\n\nThe first Chinese who came to Siam were mainly poor farmers looking for work. Besides the good trade across the river, Chinatown did not have a good name, good money was made in brothels, opium pawns and gambling houses. You must know that this was not at the place where Chinatown is now located, but a bit more to the north, the place where the famous Grand Palace now stands. When King Rama I moved the former capital from Thonburi to Rattanakosin the Chinese traders were asked to leave the area. In this way the Chinese ended up a bit lower on the river. The popular Sampeng Market used to be called Sin Allay because there was a lot of illegal trade. Nowadays there is no trace of it anymore.\n\nThe Chinese population in Thailand grew in the first three Reigns of the Chakri Kings through free immigration. Famine in southern China caused many Hokiens and Teochews to migrate to Southeast Asia.\n\nThe new immigrants belonged to an official and were forced to work, and these immigrants were tattooed on their wrists. Otherwise the immigrant could can pay a government tax and be free to seek employment. These freed immigrants will be give token to tie around their wrist.\n\nTrade between China and Thailand grew at the same time as Chinese migration increased. Chinese junk became a familiar ship in Bangkok and Sino-Thai trade peaked in the reign of King Rama II.\n\nThe advent of the steamship resulted in a reduction in trade with China as Thailand switched to trade with the West. However, the steamship brought even more Chinese immigrants. Between the World Wars from 1918 to 1931, Chinese immigration hit 1.3 million.\n\nSoi Phalittaphon Soi Sun Yat Sen\n\nA significant development in the first half of the 20th century was the rise of Chinese nationalism. Dr Sun Yat Sen, the father of the Chinese republic, visited Yaowarat when he came to Bangkok in 1910. Soi Sun Yat Sen is named in his honour.\n\nDr Sun Yat Sen was on a tour of South East Asian countries to raise funds from the overseas Chinese for the Chinese Revolution. On 22 Jan 2004, during the Chinese New Year, Chinatown Bangkok celebrated its 222nd anniversary with a two-day festival. The residents organized a grand celebration to commemorate the occasion. The ceremony was graced by Her Majesty Queen Sirikit and Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirikorn. On this grand occasion, Soi Phalittaphon was renamed Soi Sun Yat Sen to honour the father of the Chinese Revolution in 1911 and also the contributions of the Thai Chinese community.\n\nRatchawong Pier\n\nRatchawong Pier located at the end of Ratchawong Road in the area of Chinatown close to historic and shopping districts, Sampheng and Song Wat Road. The pier was the port where goods were embarking to the cargo ships anchored middle the Chao Phraya River. These ships were the main means of transport, both passengers and cargoes in its heyday. Presently, the pier is one of the main ports for passenger ferries crossing Chao Phraya River to Tha Din Daeng, the another Bangkok's Chinatown. Interestingly, post-World War II, this pier was considered a venue for young people similar to Siam Square at present. It was a centre of many famous and tasty restaurants."
