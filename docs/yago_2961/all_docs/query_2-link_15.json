        "text": "5 May 2019 - A much anticipated day - the day we would know which members of the Royal Family will receive new titles and names. Most people who are familiar with royalty know already that the King's 3 children would become \"Chao Fahs\", the highest ranking the King and Queen, reserved for children of the King. In the old days, only the King's children with a Queen Consort would become Chao Fahs, but today, the customs has changed to include the King's children. Another member of the family that everyone wanted to know was Princess Sirindhorn, the King's hard-working younger sister, who already holds a very high rank, only second to the Crown Prince. And lastly, the King's older sister, who had relinguished her royal status to marry a commoner, and has been in the news quite a bit recently - would she be made a princess again? As it turns out, she did not. It is fair to say that she has not represent the Royal Family in doing their work for the people and country as much as the others, so time will tell if she will increase her workload, and finally become a royal again. Please click for more information about Royal Titles, simplified. Thai Royal titles are quite different from Europeans. Princes and Princesses have different ranks within the family as well, though they might be all Royal Highnesses. And, there are meanings in the names too. The royals will have different ranks and titles, and names under different reigns, signifying their links to the Monarchs. Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, the King's mother, is now known as Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, the Queen Mother, but in Thai Her Majesty is now \"Queen of a Thousand Years\". The first Queen Consort to be both The Queen Regent as well as the Queen of a Thousand Years was Queen Sri Bajarindra, Queen Consort of King Chulalongkorn, and mother to King Vajiravudh. Incidentally, His Majesty identifies quite closely with King Vajiravudh, who held the name with a similar meaning, as well as having been King following a long-reigning King-Father. 7 May 2019 - The palace announced that His Majesty the King had given The Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao 2nd Class as well as the Rama X Ratanabhorn Medal 2nd Class to Khun Ploypailin Jensen and Khun Sirikitiya Jensen, daughters of Toon Kramom Ying Ubolratana Rajakanya, His Majesty the King's elder sister. Khun Ploypailin, the older sister, will now have the title of Thanpuying in front of her name, but Khun Sirikitiya will still use \"Khun\" as she is unmarried. Only married ladies will be able to use the title of Thanpuying. They have both been helping His Majesty the King in various areas in the past years. Incidentally, they are now of equal ranking to their mother, who though is known by her courtesy title of Toon Kramom Ying, she is in fact would officially be Thanpuying Ubolratana Rajkanya. On the same day, the King also gave different Orders to the Serene Highnesses who were involved in the Coronation Ceremony, most appropriately but one, I must note."
