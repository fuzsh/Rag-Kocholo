        "text": "An amazing and fascinating experience with the culture and history. visitors often onte the temple ðŸ›• is serene and Majestic ambiance, which stands in contrast to the bustling city of Bangkok.\n\nThe temple's peaceful ambiance and stunning craftsmanship make it a must-visit for anyone interested in Thai culture and Buddhism.\n\nAbsolutely beautiful place! Full of Thai-Buddhist history and culture. Lots of photo-worthy locations. Wear long pants and appropriate clothes. Donâ€™t be tricked by the vendors outside, can buy cheap pants inside that are nice. You can also see the palace and the queenâ€™s museum right after in the same area."
