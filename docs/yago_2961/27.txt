Chakri Dynasty Country Kingdom of Thailand Titles King of Siam (1782-1949)

King of Thailand (1949-Present) Founder Rama I Current head Rama IX Founding 1782

The Chakri Dynasty (also known as the House of Chakri) (Thai: ราชวงศ์จักรี: Rajawongse Chakri) is the current ruling royal house of the Kingdom of Thailand, the Head of the house is the King of Thailand. The dynasty has ruled Thailand since the founding of the Ratthanakosin era and the city of Bangkok in 1782 following the end of King Taksin of Thonburi's reign, when the capital of Siam shifted to Bangkok. The Royal house was founded by King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke an Ayutthayan military leader.

Prior to the founding of the dynasty, King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I), held the title of Chao Pharaya Chakri for over ten years. This title was held by the greatest warlords of Ayuthaya and was meant to reflect the prowess of the holder on the battlefield. In the founding of the dynasty King Rama I himself chose both name and emblem for the dynasty. The Chakri which provides both name and emblem to the house of Chakri, is composed of the discus (Chakra) and the trident (Trisula, sometimes shortened to "Tri" in Thai language), the celestial weapon of the God Narayana (an Avatar of Vishnu) of whom the Siamese king is seen as a personification. The coined name Chakri thus denotes the transcending force of divine strength and stability upon the physical realm. The current Head of the Dynasty is King Bhumibol Adulyadej since 1946, the Heir Apparent to the headship is Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. The House's dynastic seat is the Grand Palace in Bangkok.

Royal Family of Thailand

The present Royal Family of Thailand is descended from HRH Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkla (1898–1929) and Srinagarindra (later Princess Mother) (1900–1995) forming the House of Mahidol (ราชสกุลมหิดล) ( a cadet branch of the Dynasty). The Prince was a son of King Chulalongkorn the Great and his wife Queen Consort Savang Vadhana. The Prince was also the half-brother of both King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok. After the death of King Ananda Mahidol (Prince Mahidol's elder son), the present monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej (the Prince's younger son) ascended the throne in 1946. In 1949 the King married his first cousin once removed, Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara (a daughter of Mom Chao Nakkhatra Mangkala Kitiyakara, a grandson of King Chulalongkorn).

Vice-Kings

Main article: Front Palace

The Vice-King of Siam or the Krom Phrarajawang Bavorn Sathan Mongkol (กรมพระราชวังบวรสถานมงคล) was an office created during the Ayutthaya period. Until 1885 every Chakri king had a vice-king or (Maha Uparaja (มหาอุปราช), also often translated as Second King) who lived in the Front Palace (วังหน้า) (a palace complex to the north of the Grand Palace, now the site of the National Museum). Usually the brother of the monarch, the vice-king was designated heir to the throne, however only Prince Isarasundhorn was able to ascend the throne as King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai. The office was extremely prestigious and carried with it almost equal status to the king, this can be seen in Prince Chutamani (younger brother of King Mongkut), who was elevated to King Pinklao in 1851 (he carried with him the styles and titles of a King). The system was abolished by King Chulalongkorn when his vice-king and cousin Prince Bovorn Vichaicharn died. He then declared his oldest son the Crown Prince of Siam, but not vice-king.
