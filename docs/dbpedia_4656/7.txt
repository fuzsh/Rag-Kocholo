To survive, they must make their way through the mall, where they will meet other survivors and devise an escape plan.

Official synopsis

Description[]

The game follows the premise of the movie in which the player arrives at Crossroads Mall, then must find a way into the building, and ultimately escape through the parking garage. There are three playable characters, each modeled loosely on one of the three main characters from the film: The nurse (Ana Clark), police officer (Kenneth Hall), and salesman (Michael). There are five levels to complete to finish the story, starting with the parking lot and ending in the parking garage. The second level fetures the inside of the mall where you meet mall security (modeled after CJ) to activate the elevators to the basement. Completing story mode unlocks survival mode, in which waves of zombies attack the player until the player succumbs to the infection.

In addition to the character options, the player could choose one melee weapon (shovel, bat, golf club, hammer, or fire axe), one handgun (Glock or Magnum), and one larger gun (rifle, shotgun, or M-16) for their playthrough. Gameplay is top-down, twin-stick, allowing the player to move in one direction and attack in a different direction.
