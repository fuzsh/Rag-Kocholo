        "text": "OK, so maybe no-one has asked this question, and maybe some (including me, I admit) have suggested that Elite Dangerous is a dying game. I thought that given another game on the list I will put below is pretty much dead, much to the annoyance of those who liked its promising start, I wanted to see how Elite Dangerous compares to other MMO's currently still going, regardless of genre. So I looked up the numbers on Steam Charts based on past 30 days:\n\nGameSteam Charts NumbersFinal Fantasy XIV Online19,000 - 24,000World Of Tanks14,600 - 12,000World Of Warships8,300 - 7,300Elite Dangerous4,200 - 4,900Star Wars The Old Republic3,700 - 4,800Eve Online3,700 - 3,700Star Trek Online940 - 970Lord Of The Rings Online737 - 842Fisher Online517 - 612DC Universe Online412 - 505Dungeons & Dragons Online201 - 290World Of Warplanes129 - 138Champions Online72- 97Starbase39 - 64\n\nA couple of things to note here: Some of these games listed have their own launchers and those numbers aren't included here because there is no information available on those numbers. One obvious omission here is World Of Warcraft for that very reason, it's not on Steam. Single player games like Cyberpunk are also not included in this list.\n\nSo, as far as player numbers go, Elite Dangerous is doing quite well, based on Steam numbers. Starbase is the game I mentioned earlier, and even reviews and discussions on Steam are warning everyone it's a dead game. The developers are still trying to keep the game going, holding an in-game event in a few days time, but players are not expecting a good turn out for it.\n\nSo why is mentioning Starbase relevant? It's a game where you play a robot, in space, building and piloting space ships, with activities such as mining, trading, salvaging and pirating, just like Elite. And like Elite has come under heavy criticism for the decisions made by developers to add or remove features from the game, and yet the player numbers are incredibly low.\n\nEven a game like SWTOR is still going, with pretty decent numbers compared to Elite Dangerous. SWTOR is a little older than Elite Dangerous, having launched in December 2011, at about the time Elite Dangerous's kickstart launched. It has had constant support from the developers with regular expansions, has a thriving cosmetic store, is Bioware's #1 earner for microtransactions and yet has had people saying or asking if the game is dead, for years.\n\nSo to summarise: Is Elite Dangerous dead? No, not yet it isn't, and there's no reason to think it will die any time soon, but Frontier only need to make one mistake, and they could see player support for Elite disappear overnight. You might say Frontier have made many mistakes since 2014, such as offline mode, dropping VR support and console support, but these haven't resulted in player numbers dropping to levels where the game is dead, such as Starbase. Personally, I hope Frontier turn things around and Elite Dangerous is still going in 10 years time, after all, World Of Warcraft is still going strong nearly 20 years after it launched, so who knows?\n\nI love swtor. Playing it still (soloing) 10 years later on a well endowed f2p account. There are many people playing the game, but its dead as far as developer support goes. The service updates and new content only qualify by technicality. To the spirit of the maintaining an online service its not even close. It does get more than elite though if you want to draw comparisons.\n\nSee its an odd question, because if you're playing a game and liking it, when you're in game, in chat, on reddit, that's all that matters. The \"dead game\" thing is 100% in the context of creating bottles of inhaled positivity and of course trolling. Its not real, its only in the dimension of white knights and trolls.\n\nYeah, swtor is in maintenance mode but in its own world has a thriving population. There's people everywhere you go to always remind you of being in an mmo, which is enough for me. Ps. Im a solo carebear so am there for the existing content. The progression and competitive multiplayer crowd probably left years ago as thats not serviced enough, in that sense the community is probably like post oddyssey, the only people left are the people who still have something out of the remainders, its not driving forward.\n\nps. Also just like elite, there is a developer provided launcher, though while elites players would be mainly on steam im guessing the opposite for swtor. Steam is actually better for swtor because it uses steams infrastructure to patch.\n\nI don't know where he gets his numbers from.. but i wonder where elite is at. When they cancelled consoles it must have been a blow. They wouldn't have tried for over a year? to make it work if it wasn't worth it?\n\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTXnjx7Lem0&t=270s\n\nOK, so maybe no-one has asked this question, and maybe some (including me, I admit) have suggested that Elite Dangerous is a dying game.

Personally, I hope Frontier turn things around and Elite Dangerous is still going in 10 years time, after all, World Of Warcraft is still going strong nearly 20 years after it launched, so who knows?\n\nReally nice summary, however for folks like myself who (A) hardly play any other games and most importantly, (B) don't know what year the ones listed were released, it would be nice to have known the year of release of the game since ED has been out(ish) for 10 years now. Just for comparison, of course.\n\nGot a busy day, I will try and get this information later and post it here.\n\nI wish people would stop trying to conjure up the death of the game. You can find threads about ED being dead dating back at least five years. Don't you have better things to do?\n\nSteam charts don't paint a comprehensive picture anyway, with the game being available via three different distribution services. Look at what is happening in and around game: Even the most boring CGs finish in record time, because the players are hot for the outcome. The official live streams regularely pull four to five thousand viewers combined over the two Frontier channels. The hotspots of the game are pretty busy, not just in open, but even in Mobius. We have a (subjectively, at least) exciting galactic war fresh on our hands, and at least two more updates are annonced for this year.\n\nDoes it have the pull of the big ones? Of course not. Don't be silly, it is still a niché game in a niché genre. But as you can easily check yourself, it is far from dead. Content creators like Yamiks and OA have been trying to reason the community into believing it is dead for quite a while now. It is starting to get old."
