        "text": "My children and the children of my friends are not immune to smartphone addiction.\n\nCase in point: shortly after friends arrived at a gathering at our home last weekend, the other adults and I were laughing around our super-sized table. I looked into the living room to see four teenagers sitting in separate corners, faces down, each in his or her own world, each on an iPhone. These are kids who know each other well and enjoy each other’s company.\n\nI played the bad guy and, with their parents’ blessings, I went around the room, took all of their phones and hid them.\n\nThe truth is that these particular kids know that I know a secret. They know an activity that we have played hundreds of times — all of us, kids and adults alike — that will get every one of them (and the adults in the room as well) to put down their phones voluntarily.\n\nIt’s an old-fashioned parlor game.\n\nI would venture to say that, at this point, the kids love it even more than I do. It’s called The Name Game. I’ve been playing it with and teaching it to groups of friends since 1994.\n\nWhile the game is simple, it taxes almost everyone’s brain. Yet, it’s fun. It’s strategic. It gets people engaged. It helps people get to know each other better. And to make the game happen, someone has to say, “Let’s play The Name Game.”\n\nSomeone has to get the paper and pencil.\n\nSomeone has to get everyone to come together.\n\nWhile I adore organic fun, I believe that sometimes someone has to defy the inertia of the evening and get everyone engaged. Sitting around having conversation with little meaning is not really anyone’s idea of fun.\n\nThe only equipment required is a pen or pencil, a piece of paper and enough room for everyone to sit in a rough circle. I’ll post the directions, but the game itself is not the point of this column.\n\nThe point is that smartphones allow us to exist in our own little worlds in a way that humans never have before. Many kids and adults are craving ways to interact with each other — to have a conversation, to laugh, to be silly. There are other options, for sure, but The Name Game has the potential to provide those things, as do other games which also only require pen and paper — including Gender on the Sofa, The Animal Game and something Elizabeth Brooks taught us that we call Stacks.\n\nI realize The Name Game can’t solve all the problems this world has to offer, but it can bring a group of people together. It can also create a platform for a shared experience that has the capacity to improve group dynamics and build relationships — and those things can lead to lots of other good things.\n\nGive it a try! If you have a question, email me and I’ll walk you through the instructions which may seem more cumbersome than they really are.\n\nThe Name Game Instructions\n\nThe Name Game is typically the perfect game for a group of people who know some or most of the group members’ names, some of the group members well and some not at all. The game builds teamwork and relationships in surprising ways. The facilitator simply needs a pen and notebook and gathers the group in a circle. Allow about one hour for this activity. The game is not recommended for groups of more than 20 people and is most ideal for between 8 and 16 people.\n\nFirst, the facilitator says, “We’re about to play The Name Game. We will play at least two rounds, maybe three, depending on time. Everyone needs to think of a person or character — living or dead, fictional or realistic, celebrity, politician, local or international. Please do not say the name of the person or character that comes to mind out loud. The ONLY requirement for your character is that everyone in the room MUST recognize the name. I’ll give you a minute to think. Again, please don’t say the name aloud and don’t tell anyone the name you've chosen.”\n\nThe facilitator gives the group between one and three minutes to think of names. Then, each participant whispers his or her chosen name in the facilitator’s ear. The facilitator writes down the names in random order, not allowing the participant to see the list. The facilitator also adds in one extra name as a “decoy” name.\n\nWhen the facilitator has gathered a name from each participant and has added one additional name to the list, he or she says, “Now, here comes the tricky part. I will now read the list of names twice — and only twice. Please note that I have added a name to the list as a decoy name. You cannot guess me. The list is in no particular order, but I will read it in the same order both times. When I have read it twice (slowly), Sally here to my immediate right will guess who she believes says a certain name.\n\nIf Sally is correct, the person she guessed MUST come to her. Sally cannot go to the person she guessed or it messes up the order of the game. Together then, Sally and the person she guessed become Team Sally and guess again. They continue guessing and growing in team members as long as they guess correctly.\n\nHowever, if Sally guesses incorrectly, the turn moves to the next person on her right. As the game continues, if Robert guesses Sally, then Sally and the rest of her team move to where Robert is located and become Team Robert.”\n\nFor the game to work properly, those guessed MUST move to the individual or team that guesses correctly. Ultimately, the game typically comes to down to two large teams with rival team captains offering sometimes unlikely alliances and surprising strategy. The interesting twist on this game occurs in the subsequent rounds of play as participants try to offer names that others wouldn’t guess quickly.\n\nJan Risher writes a weekly column for The Daily Advertiser.
