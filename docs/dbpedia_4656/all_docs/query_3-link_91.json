        "text": "So I figured a change of name is in order - due to the fact in the beginning I was only doing these bad boys on more popular game franchises but when it comes down to it - there’s a big case of scraping the barrel when someone considers “x niche game” as their favourite game, I know there’s potentially someone out there who does consider “A Bugs Life” on PlayStation 1 as their favourite… but you get my drift. Also it leaves more variety for all that good stuff.\n\nSo today we’ll be going through the game of Frostpunk, a post apocalyptic city building survival game. It follows the world in 1860 something after natural disaster events lead to global cooling - pretty cool… so pop your mittens on, we’re going on an expedition to see if it sucks.\n\nGameplay and Stuff: With Frostpunk you start off with your initial small group of survivors who you control to mine, chop and all that good stuff on limited supplies in the crater you’re in. Essentially if you run out of supplies in the first 10 minutes you’re done. The game implements the choice of using laws to raise productivity at the cost of discontent i.e. Child Labour, 24 hours working day, which provides, as mentioned, more productivity at the cost of discontent. As the days progress as does the climate in turn getting colder or back up to a more standard cold… That’s essentially it in terms of gameplay – collect resources, don’t die.\n\nContent in Game: I have a few hours in the game, and nothing is really that outstanding or memorable – I remember how specific it is in having to have roads connect from the main generator to connect the blocks/city segments. You can send out explorers to find abandoned places that may contain resources and may potentially come with a fight or flight scenario in case you haven’t faced enough death. Also, unlocking different laws helps unlock different city segments for example – care homes, fighting arenas etc to help keep moral, not that you need it because the game intentionally sets you up to fail. There’re different scenarios although I haven’t gotten around to playing them because yknow…\n\nMy Personal Opinion: This game is difficult and by difficult, I mean it intentionally sets you up to fail difficult. I know for a fact someone is going to comment “URGH DAS BECOZ U DON’T KNO HOW TO PLAY A STRATEGY SURVIVAL GAME” well, no, because frankly the premise that you start in a situation that’ll kill with the lack of things to help you survive isn’t survival, there’s only so much one can do. As I mentioned I played it for a couple of hours and that was enough to establish I won’t really want to play it again – it’s a cool concept but it just chucks one thing after the other at you.\n\n“Oh, your people are starving by the way, it’s colder now, oh yeah as well as it being cold your people no longer trust you because you said you’d build houses but RNG didn’t provide enough wood”\n\nSo, does it suck?\n\nYes, in my opinion it does suck the reason being is I could probably play another city building game and have 100% more fun. Inb4 “THE SURVIVAL ASPECT MAKES IT UNIQUE” well, Age of Empires has a survival aspect too, in the sense that if you start on the rest of the AI, you have a limited amount of time before they kick your ass.\n\nIn case you didn’t know, this is by the creators of This War of Mine, which explains the bleakness. I think they tried to split the difference between city builder and survival game, and ended up with something that isn’t satisfying enough in either direction.\n\nI’ll give you (or anyone else who is going to give it a try) a hint, the most precious resource isn’t anything lying on the ground or steam cores, it’s your people. There’s no natural population growth so even one person dying early on can snowball into a game over as you are unable to man your buildings. The scenarios are tough, but I didn’t find the sandboxes to be as hard, there’s a very steep hump in the early game you have to get over while you’re busy researching and building infrastructure, but after that you should be able to keep a city going and afford exploring for steam cores. However, all of that is basically why I haven’t played the game in a while. There should at least be a difficulty setting that gives you more people to play with at the beginning. I should feel like restarting a scenario in a city builder within 30 minutes of the start due to something not quite going my way\n\nAlso, when you start a new city, implement child labor and soup. For the aforementioned reasons."
