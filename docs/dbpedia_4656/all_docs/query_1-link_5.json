        "text": "The story is good. There's no doubt in that. But the game was likely not made with the mobile platform in mind, resulting in confusing, clunky movement and camera controls. It's also a choice-heavy game with no option to save manually or skip cutscenes (many of which are unnecessary and lengthy). So it means if you were to alter the outcome of a choice, you often have to replay a good 10+ min of game, rewatching the characters engage in boring, mundane activities such as opening a door (every door-opening in this game has a long cutscene. For atmospheric reason I understand why, but they should only play once).\n\nDid I also say you are likely to get some dialogue options wrong? Not because you would regret your choice, but many dialogue choices do not reflect what your character would actually say. The choices are a short version of your character's often emotional, long response, and there were moments that I went \"wait, I did not mean it that way! I did not know you'd say it like a jerk...guess I'll have to rewind again.\"\n\nThe game would be much better if it were not so frustrating at times. I recommend buying the PC version, which at least has slightly better navigation.\n\nI downloaded this game before but deleted it cuz I wasnât much of an TWD fan, but decided to come back after so many years later since TWD the original had officially ended and really needed to feel the vibe of it. And I was facing the same problem as well with the eps not being downloaded after buying (and yes I ignored what other reviews said). But now that they do work now I can enjoy playing all 5 eps and plus the 400 days of the 5 characters. Thanks for putting so much work into this dev and I really mean it looking forward to playing season 2 hopefully sometime this year.\n\nOh and FYI, if itâs ever possible could you also do Season 3 and Michonne series, that would really mean a lot to me though I understand doing may take many years of work and a lot to do, so take as much time as you or yâall need, but just know that I am willing to play both of the first and second season games with no regrets. And I honestly donât know if I am now the first person to re-trying this game and gonna do season 2 soon but I really hope that this season will indeed work. And if even not now, then hopefully in the future.\n\nAnd again, thank you so much Dev for all the hard work you have done, and hope from the bottom of my heart that you continue doing great and that the games will work and will reach success in the futures.\n\nAnd one more FYI, hopefully season 4 the finale as well"
