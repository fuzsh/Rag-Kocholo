        "text": "Consider with me, for a moment, Dead Cells: a video game where you play a sentient blob of goo that takes over decapitated bodies in order to escape an elaborate, sprawling prison. In my time here on Earth, I have probably played more video games than it is safe to admit in polite company. A lot of them are needlessly complicated things, mistaking wealth of content for depth—but few are so needlessly weird. There is no real reason for Dead Cells to cast you as a sentient pile of corpse-stealing goo. It just does. I have a lot of respect for that.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, Dead Cells is a game built around one goal: escaping a prison. There's a catch, though: You're supposed to fail, and fail often. Dying in Dead Cells starts the entire game over, but every time you die, the prison and its surrounding areas rearrange themselves. You'll still find all the same zones in the same order, but their corridors and platforms and secrets will be new every time. It's a bit like Spelunky—one of the greatest games of the 21st century—in that way. If the game keeps changing, it sucks less when you have to start over.\n\nBut, ideally, you won't stay the same either. While you start Dead Cells as a goo-possessed corpse with naught but a sword and the option to pick up a bare-bones shield or bow, you'll quickly find more. Better weapons, cool gadgets, boosts to your health and attack power. All of that will go away once you die (which stings) but you also get permanent upgrades that either open up new areas or make restarting less painful. Some of these are just found as you explore, but most of them are obtained by collecting and spending Cells, a currency you get from killing monsters. Make it to a character called the Collecter without dying, and you can deposit your Cells towards an upgrade that lets you save your money when you die, or gives you better starting weapons, or a health potion so you can last longer on a given run.\n\nThat's more or less all there is to it. You start up a game, see how far you can make it, and start over when you fail. It's like that Tom Cruise Live/Die/Repeat movie (née *Edge of Tomorrow) but in a game that looks kind of like Castlevania—and by the way, it looks great. The art is wonderful, evocative stuff that suggests a wild story hidden behind it, but swiftly makes fun of you for thinking that there's some kind of grand narrative here. It's just a weird game about some body-stealing goo out to escape a prison. Escaping it, however, feels really damn good. You run and roll and slash with a nimbleness that's completely satisfying, and the game's semi-closed loop (there is an ending/goal, and it's quite attainable) makes it easy to pick up and play for as little or as long as you want. It's a game that's substantial and fun to play on any console, but is best played on a Switch—which, like Dead Cells, is a system that can be decapitated and controlled by sentient blobs of goo who then use it to escape boredom. Video games are weird like that."
