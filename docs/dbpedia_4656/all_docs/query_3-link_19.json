        "text": "FAQ\n\nCan I see the info on the student cards in the middle of the table?\n\nNo, you canât. Trying to remember as much as you can about a student when they are introduced is the point. So pay attention when a card is placed down. You canât go back to review the information later.\n\nCan transformer cards be used multiple times?\n\nNo, if you are lucky to have one transformer card, you can use it to save yourself once only. Once it is used, it need to be discarded.\n\nShould I always try to claim similarity with the card that is placed on the table the earliest?\n\nYes! The more cards there are placed between your card and the card you want to claim similarity with, the more cards you win. So if you think you have a card similar to the very first one on the table, try to claim it!\n\nCan I claim similarity as soon as I see one?\n\nNo, you canât. You have to wait until itâs your turn to claim similarity!\n\nCan I use forever to figure out similarities between two cards?\n\nNo, you canât. You only have 30 seconds to decide which card to play when it is your turn.\n\nIs the color at the back of the cards signify something?\n\nThe colors used at the back of every card has no meaning. The colors are different because of pure aesthetic variety. The maps on the back though signifies the region that the student comes from.\n\nCan I alter the game rules?\n\nOf course! Getting rid of the ânon-repeatâ rule will make the game much simpler. However, you can also try to make the rules stricter. For example, come up with a list of reasons that canât be used. Or limit the reasons to only be about geography/ personal fun facts."
