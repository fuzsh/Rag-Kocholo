Other than that, people have programmed in ways to visually change your username within their games, such as a /nickname command, this requires some good knowledge of GMS and GML though.\n\nPick on 27 Dec 2017, 13:46:06\n\nAdding on to what Size said earlier, you would be able to change your name In-Game, and for other people with the correct programming."
