        "text": "Video game deaths may not mean much to the average player; however, some of these characters felt like real people, and the gaming community has grown attached to them. Hardcore fans who became invested in character arcs are forever affected by how they went out and tears are shed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome game developers are experts at building a character with great potential and appeal and pulling the plug in unexpected and unimaginable ways. Here are five video game deaths that impacted the gaming community and continue to be remembered.\n\n5. Brok in God of War Ragnarok\n\nThe Norse Saga was a nice change of pace for the God of War franchise and introduced new characters. The Huldra brothers earned the trust of Kratos and Atreus after aiding them on many occasions by upgrading their gear, helping in missions, and offering them a safe place to stay amidst Ragnarok.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrok paid the ultimate price after catching on to Odin’s lies as he was impersonating Tyr. No other character and not even the gods could see through what Odin had up his sleeve, Brok on the other hand, a mere dwarf can sniff lies from a mile away.\n\nAtreus avenged him after destroying the mask and ruining the All-Father’s pursuit of infinite knowledge. Brok’s loved ones gathered around one last time and gave him a Viking funeral as Sindri entered a dark place.\n\n4. Maria Santiago in Gears of War 2\n\nPutting a loved one to sleep is never easy, and Dom had to pull the trigger ending the suffering of his beloved wife, Maria. The Locust Horde is a race of ruthless barbarians who inflict their will on whomever they please.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDom did his best to rescue his captured wife but was unfortunately too late. Maria experienced intense forms of torture and became another casualty of war, she was in a state beyond recovery and the most humane thing to do was put her out of her misery at the hands of her husband.\n\n3. Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2\n\nOutlaws like Arthur are no longer welcome in an era of law and order. Morgan and his gang could not commit heinous crimes while maintaining a code of honor. In the Red Dead Redemption prequel, Arthur succumbs to tuberculosis and players decide how to live the rest of his days.\n\nAlthough there are a few options for how he dies, it depends on the player’s activities. The outcome of death is unavoidable but players can give the man his wish of being laid on the side of a mountain facing the sun to remember the good days until his final breath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Lee in Telltale’s The Walking Dead\n\nLee lost his life going after Clementine and he went out swinging. After being bitten by a walker on the arm, Lee knew what it meant. Players can amputate his arm but it will not change the outcome and he endured the pain to look for Clementine and get her to safety.\n\nNothing is sadder than seeing a character with great growth and development taken away. Lee gave it his all to save Clementine and in the end, the player can ask the child to put Lee out of his misery or leave to reanimate as a walker.\n\n1. Joel Miller in The Last of Us Part 2\n\nThe Last of Us is arguably one of the best stories ever told in a video game and the gaming community had high hopes for the sequel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7 years after the original game’s release on the PlayStation 3, Naughty Dog presented The Last of Us Part 2 and fans were caught off guard.\n\nFans knew that at some point Joel would die but didn’t expect it to be early on in the game or act as the catalyst for Ellie’s revenge quest. Some believe the sequel romanticizes violence and gore and many fans were unhappy to see a beloved character go out unceremoniously.\n\nWhich video game death hit you the hardest?
