However, there was this one time when I was standing in front of a mountain of a target and typically, I procastinated.. and guess what.. it didn’t happen! Somehow, the magic didn’t seem to work.. and that failure seeped into everything else. Suddenly nothing worked when I did things in the last minute..\n\nI have never considered myself disciplined but hey.. that is the name of the game. When employed, its about waking up in the morning every day and going to work and performing..and then coming back home and performing and doing that again and again..and again..\n\nHard reality..\n\nShakespeare wrote his sonnets within a strict discipline, fourteen lines of iambic pentameter, rhyming in three quatrains and a couplet. Were his sonnets dull? Mozart wrote his sonatas within an equally rigid discipline – exposition, development, and recapitulation. Were they dull?” – David Oglivy"
