        "text": "I recently played this game with a friend and we had a blast. (And with just minor prep work, we were able to play via online.) The rules are concrete enough to provide great structure, and flexible enough to make the experince deeply special. The use of tarot cards is very unique and adds to the story in a beautiful way. I was nervous about the ritual aspect, but it actually adds to the game play in way that builds the characters and the world. I would definitely recommend purchasing if you are undecided. My friend and I still talk about our game play because it was that memorable; we're thinking about playing again sometime soon.\n\nDead Friend is a two-player trpg with strong layout, clever writing, and fascinating mechanics of play.\n\nSpecifically, it plays like a ritual, and the whole of the book leans into that feeling. There's elemental diagrams, moments of silence during gameplay are encouraged and respected, you play with tarot and salt and matches and coins...\n\nIt's immersive.\n\nThere's also a really cool message in the game. You play as someone trying to bring back your dead friend, and also as the dead friend who wants something diametrically opposed to that. When people die, we tend to confine them to reputations and stories that do not contain the whole of them, and this game gets that.\n\nThe ritual structure does make the game a little complex, and you may both want to read it through more than once before playing it, but I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes dramatic, intense games. Dead Friend is a heck of a thing, and if you're on the fence, buy it.\n\nPlayed this for the first time with a friend after getting it in the bundle and it was INCREDIBLE. The mechanics with the cards are so well done and really make the game easy to play and really help the story tell itself. We had such a wonderful time weaving a heartfelt, complex, spooky and occasionally silly story of two Victorian dandies in love. Truly a favorite that we intend to play over and over."
