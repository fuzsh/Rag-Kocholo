        "text": "Amidst the decline of the Wild West at the turn of the 20th century, outlaw Arthur Morgan and his gang struggle to cope with the loss of their way of life.\n\nIn a world devastated by the undead, a convicted criminal is given a second chance at life when he comes across a little girl named Clementine.\n\nEngineer Isaac Clarke and his crew get stranded on a large, abandoned mining ship. There, Clarke needs to repair the giant ship while battling nasty aliens and solving the mystery of what happened to the ship.\n\nA former outlaw is forced by the federal government to hunt down the members of his old gang.\n\nSet in the 26th century, the story follows engineer Isaac Clarke on a mission to repair the USG Ishimura, a mining spaceship that has been overrun by undead creatures called Necromorphs.\n\nSet three years after the events of the first, Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station above Saturn's largest moon, Titan.\n\nClementine and her adoptive brother, AJ, come across a boarding school inhabited by other children with little memory of life before the apocalypse.\n\nLeft to fend for herself, Clementine has been forced to learn how to survive in a world gone mad. Many months have passed and she is in search of safety.\n\nAfter a highly-infectious undead plague spreads across the frontier, John Marston does anything he can to find a cure.\n\nFour new survivors must make their way across the American South while surviving a zombie apocalypse.\n\nA multi player co-op in post-apocalyptic Pennsylvania, where four immune survivors, Francis, Bill, Zoey, and Louis fight through hordes of zombies and Special Infected as they make their way to extraction zones.\n\nSet in the 1880s, you as a bounty hunter must stop a gang of outlaws from the Wild West. You need to also find and kill the man who murdered your parents in order to avenge them. On your path you will be aided by those willing to help you.\n\nA teenage Clementine and a new survivor named Javier are brought together when a new threat worse than the dead arises.\n\nSet on the frozen planet of Tau Volantis, Isaac Clarke and John Carver team up as they attempt to end the Necromorph threat once and for all.\n\nCentered on a truck stop on a Georgia highway, \"400 Days\" tells five linked stories; each taking place at different points in time and from the point of view of a different survivor, from day 2 of the undead apocalypse to day 400.\n\nIn the rise of a new zombie outbreak, the new hero Chuck Greene has to help his daughter survive this zombie nightmare.\n\nRising 3 takes place ten years after the events of Dead Rising 2 (2010), in the city of Los Perdidos, California and follows a new protagonist, Nick Ramos, who is in the midst of the looming zombie apocalypse.\n\nDead by Daylight is a multiplayer horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught and killed.\n\nWhen a mysterious outbreak claims the island of Banoi, four individuals who find themselves immune must use that power to protect the remaining survivors, uncover the truth, and escape.\n\nThe story of what led the katana wielding survivor, Michonne, away from Rick Grimes' settlement at the Alexandria Safe Zone and what eventually brought her back.\n\nKane and Lynch: Dead Men follows the violent and chaotic journey of two men - a flawed mercenary and a medicated psychopath - and their brutal attitude towards right and wrong.\n\nThe Dead Island heroes escaped in a helicopter to the safety of a military ship, but when a furious storm hits, the virus suddenly spreads leaving hope drowning in the rising tides."
