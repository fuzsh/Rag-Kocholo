        "text": "This game doesn't have a lot of things. It misses a LOT more than it hits. But it's cheap. And I have found several redeeming qualities about it as well.\n\nThe sound can be repetitive, but it sets the mood very well. Some think: \"wow, only 4 notes constantly repeated.\" I personally think that it is this very aspect that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.\n\nI am a very experienced gamer, having played everything from Galaga to Call of Duty. And never, ever, have I found a game that made me actually FEAR encountering another enemy. You really don't want to continue. But that adds realism, because that means you are thinking EXACTLY like you would if that was not Jack the Farmer but You. It's not that the enemies are terribly difficult to defeat, if you play the game long enough you can kill every single zombie without even firing a gun. But you would just really prefer if that next corner didn't have zombies waiting around it. But you always do, so you have to just keep on trucking.\n\nBuy this game, but only if you want to be GENUINELY scared. Because you will be, should you be able to look past its shortcomings. honestly, what Horror movie fan Doesn't want to be scared?"
