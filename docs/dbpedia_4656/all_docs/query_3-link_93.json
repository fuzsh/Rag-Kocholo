        "text": "I paid 10$ to change my gamertag to a more fitting one for this game and it shows as the new one in the xbox app and in the top right of the game on main screen but when joining a lobby I still have my old gamertag. Hope its not going to stay the old one for my character otherwise i just wasted 10 dollars\n\nI saw similar thread yesterday I think with someone that specifically changed their gamer tag for Sea of Thieves and the change hadn't taken place. Someone that replied said they did the same thing and their in-game name did eventually change.\n\nGiven some of the server issues they have had which have impacted rewards and rep for chests as well as DLC being delivered it's entirely possible that account name changes are just taking awhile to go through or have temporarily been disabled whilst they work on the issues. I don't know that for a fact, just speculating as to why some people have had issues and others apparently haven't with the same thing.\n\n@visualizefsu said in Changed Gamertag, In game name isnt changing:\n\n@hudson-rl It changed!!! Thanks guys\n\nSo glad it updated for you! Hope you enjoy your new name :-)\n\nIt is pity you can't pick a 'character name' that is separate from your gamer tag."
