My auntie Val used to say “wait til you get in school & all the little girls call ya name “Jayceon” “Jayceon”...... bet you love it then.\"\n\nHe added, \"She was right & from then til’ now I’ve met so many kids named after me & it’s an honor to be able to cross paths with them from time to time.\n\n\"From the 1st “JAYCEON” to the newest born, we fly,\" he concluded.\n\nThe 'How We Do' rapper kept the tradition alive by giving his children unique names of their own: he has two sons, Harlem Caron Taylor and King Justice Taylor, and a daughter, California \"Cali\" Dream Taylor.\n\nMeanwhile, The Game recently opened up about the time he was shot five times by enemy gunfire on the 18th anniversary of the horrific incident."
