        "text": "NOTE:\n\nYou can now get the AEG version of The Captain is Dead at your local game store! This is the original version, not the AEG version.\n\nThe Captain Is Dead is now available on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows! Get your copy today!\n\nAttention Crew! The captain is dead! Our jump core is offline. There is a hostile alien ship off our port side. We need to get our jump core back online so we can get out of here. You have trained for this. You know what needs to be done. Go do it!\n\nThe Captain is Dead is a co-op game for 2 to 7 players. All you have to do is get the ship's engines (aka \"Jump Core\") back online and you win; but because there is a hostile alien ship trying to destroy you, that is easier said than done.\n\nYou have an impressive star ship full of useful systems that will help you fend off the aliens, and get the Jump Core back online. Each system gives you an advantage while it remains online. The assault from the hostile alien ship tends to keep knocking those systems offline however. So you need to balance your time between keeping the ships system's online, fending off the alien threat, and completing your objective.\n\nEach member of your crew has special abilities and skills. You need to work as a group to maximize the potential of each role. If someone tries to be a hero, you'll all die.\n\n```\n\n```"
