        "text": "This one's hard. I remember a platformer, arcade Mario Bros.-style, for Amiga in which you play as a dude wearing pajamas and it's all about fighting other dudes with kung fu.\n\nIt's not The Running Man, I can say that much.\n\nMy memory of how it looks is kinda vauge, but I do know for sure the style of the game is cartoony.\n\nCan't say much about the backdrops, sorry.\n\nAs for the setting, it's fantasy I think. The level design is a mix of Mario Bros. and Bubble Bobble, kinda (you jump to platforms).\n\nThe one I bought the Amiga from, which came with a lot of copied games btw, had labeled the disk as \"Kung Fu Pajamas\" though that's not the title of the game, but it does look like the character you're playing as are wearing pajamas.\n\nI don't think it's a sidescroller.\n\nMaybe it was homebrew and therefore not that known.\n\nThis game has been on my mind for a while now. Glad I found this thread, hopefully you guys can help.\n\nIt's a side scroller that was a mix of fighting and some shooting if you picked up a gun or ammo (don't remember which).\n\nI don't remember system, and I played it a few years ago, so not sure on year of release.\n\nIt's 1-2 players, the guys you could use were the same, looked kinda like ninjas, but were red and blue.\n\nIt was in a setting of a city (or at least levels I remember), there was a section where you could drive on a highway, or walk if you lose car.\n\nI don't recall the enemies, but I think perhaps you were a bad guy or maybe a anti-hero or vigilante or something, fighting bad guys.\n\nIt was a PS2 game I played on some kind of demo disc (I don't know if it was an official disc or just from a magazine) so I'm not entirely sure it was even made into a full game. Anyway, it was basically a 3D arena-based fighting game very early in the PS2 life cycle, you could play as a bunch of different characters but I can only remember 2 of them - one was a dinosaur and I think the other character was in a wheel chair or spaceship type thing (he was sitting down anyway). The wheel chair character could use a special kamikaze attack where he flew up into the air and then you had to guide him back down to earth and into your opponent. If you missed you would die. There were a bunch of different stages, in the demo I think you only had a desert stage though. Thanks.\n\nall right. i'm looking for a game and am trying to wrap my mind around the system you constructed here (which is pretty awesome btw). here's the game:\n\n1. I only played this game as a demo. it was on the CD of a Romanian games magazine called LEVEL (just in case someone here is Romanian). it was around the early 2000-s/late 90s\n\n2. PC game\n\n3. RPG (see details below)\n\n4. not sure how people liked it. to be honest, there is a possibility it got canned without a full release. i'm usually pretty good with keeping track of games I like\n\n5. it's an RPG so...not for kids\n\nyou start off an a shore I believe with the usual amnesia stuff. the only items you have are clothes I think. you start going through a small forest or something, getting tutorials on the game. eventually you reach a camp where you can do some quests and can get your first party member and some equipment. the chieftain tells you that you have to go out and hunt down a white wolf, which is to the left of the camp, past some trees in a cave (yes). when you kill the wolf and go back the demo ends.\n\nthe graphics are slightly polygonal (i think thats what the called). no anti-aliasing options\n\nit's not isometric, you can zoom in and out, but as far as i remember it's still mostly mouse-based controls\n\num...your dude is blonde and has white clothes at the start, but it's a possibility that you can change that anyway\n\num, thanks in advance and good luck (you'll need it...)\n\nI have a couple of games that have been driving me mad for years. I was pretty young for both so the memories are hazy.\n\nThe first is a top down PC game, which must have been from the mid 90s. The graphical quality would have been similar to Jagged Alliance. I remember it being like a cross between an rpg and action/adventure. You were a savage of some kind in Jungle environments, and the opening sections involved defending a village from rampaging instectoid monsters with a spear: possibly giant mosquitos. I remember the big theme of the game being codependency with the insects and a jungle savage aesthetic. I remember being able to drink insect nectar that would mutate your character and give you the appearance and abilities of the insects. However I think the effects were permanent and would make people adverse to you. I believe the game to be shareware. The controls were like Diablo, with the clicking to attack and so on. I think the name had something to do with arachnid in it, arachnoid, aracnox something like that.\n\nThe second is a game that I'm not sure was ever released but I remember reading a huge preview in a magazine. Similar time frame to the first game, mid to late 90s. It was a third person action game, where you played a red, winged insect. It looks similar in style to Mr Mosquito, with the house and the huge humans. The family would be your antagonists, and you had to help a community of bugs come together to defeat them (or the exterminator they had hired). I remember the scale being a big selling point, where you could escape in cracks in the wall. I also remember the magazine saying you'd be using matchsticks and other sundry items to construct traps and such. I cannot be certain of the platform, but I would guess PC as that is the only machine I had at the time. I think the name was Bugz, or similar but no research provides results.\n\nI saw this game on the IPhone a while back, but I can't remember the name. It's a game where you guide this shape (or something, might've been a ball) through a maze as fast as you can. There's a timer of sort sort too. It's either counting down or timing you, I forget which, but in any case you get graded on how fast you finished the level. There's also a few levels where they add these blinking red squares in your path that you can't pass until they go away. The name is killing me!\n\nSecond, there's this fucking astronaut game or something that came out the Xbox or in that general era. I saw a preview or review on Xplay. If I remember right, it's like some adventure game or something. Might even be a horror game. All I know is you're all alone, it's in first-person, and I can't remember the damn name."
