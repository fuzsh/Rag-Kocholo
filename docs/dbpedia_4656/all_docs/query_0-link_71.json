        "text": "When Playing Anime Girls Highschool of Dead, never go up the stairs to the other floors unless you need supplies, the reason being that zombies are too dumb to follow you up there, getting caught on level geometry, unable to turn the corners. When I first started, I ran all over the building looking for the zombies, only to find them amassed in a stairwell corner. With that realization complete, I was able to enjoy this zombie wave shooter a little bit until I came to a few more realizations, like the game cannot render over twenty-five zombies at a time. So you really only die when you want to. And that’s the thing with Anime Girls Highschool of Dead, for every thing it does sort of right, it does ten things wrong, making for a pretty mediocre experience all told.\n\nAnime Girls Highschool of Dead is a zombie wave shooter. You play as one of eight lovely anime women, rendered in realistic 3D, so they look odd. You start with out, and every 5 waves, you unlock another, who is the same model just with different clothes and hair, though they have different stats. The high school you are in looks like a standard anime high school, except all the rooms are completely devoid of furniture. You have a decent mix of weaponry, starting with a pistol, to a shotgun, assault rifle, machine gun and a grenade launcher. They are found at random in weapon boxes. Ammo is found at random in ammo boxes. There are also health boxes, which start to vanish as the waves progress.\n\nThe zombies in Anime Girls Highschool of Dead range from the standard slow, to really fast, to several kinds with weapons. The trick is bunching them all up in straight line and mowing them down with your favorite weapon. The path finding and AI are completely broken, even for a zombie game. I’ve seen zombies caught on the flower bed curbs. Like I said, if you need a breather, go upstairs and collect the stuff, then go back down.\n\nFinally, the graphics in Anime Girls Highschool of Dead are pretty lousy. I’m not sure exactly why the zombie count is so low, it would make things a whole lot harder if you have a giant horde of dozens after you. As for sound, there are two music tracks, one for the main menu, and one for the actual game. There are also no zombie moans or anything. The weapon sound effects are weak.\n\nSo where does this leave us with Anime Girls Highschool of Dead? Thoroughly unimpressed. They didn’t do enough with the premise, like with no spoken Japanese. The game play gets extremely boring after a dozen waves when you’ve seen all there is to see. There is even a typo in the title, its high school, not highschool(which i had to replicate for SEO), It is not broken crap, just not worth recommending to anyone. Therefore, this will get a Not Recommended with a five back-end score.\n\nOverall: Anime Girls Highschool of Dead is a mediocre zombie wave shooter than even the premise can’t save!\n\nVerdict: Not Recommended\n\nE-Shop Page\n\nUpdate: I was made aware that the title is a reference to the Highschool of the dead anime. Sneaky Sneaky!"
