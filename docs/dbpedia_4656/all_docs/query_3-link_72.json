        "text": "Hi fellow Grims!\n\nLeene here this time!\n\nI think it is time to tell you more about where the name of Death and Taxes came from.\n\nGame names:\n\nNaming an Indie Game is hard but I think that It is important to have a good name for your project if you want to put it on the virtual market. Name and logo is usually one of the first things a player sees about the game and first impressions are really important.\n\nAt first the project was named The Project of Death and I also called it Death Game sometimes. I really liked that the word Death was in the title because it communicates the main theme. But I didnât really want to name it just âDeath Gameâ so I had to figure out a better name.\n\nThe progress:\n\nFirst, I made a list of things I wanted the name and logo to communicate and rules they had to go under. I have a background in media- and graphic design so I took some of my knowledge from my studies and from fellow game developers and made up some rules to have a HOPEFULLY well-designed brand for the game. The list could be different for different genres of games but here are some of more broad rules.\n\nThese were the âMUST HAVEâ categories for a good name:\n\nEasy to pronounce\n\nNot too long or short\n\nNo other games should have it\n\nPiques interest\n\nTells you something about the game\n\nIsnât too âbeautifulâ or âcheesyâ (if not an epic fantasy game)\n\nIs google-able (search engine optimization) THIS IS IMPORTANT!\n\nLooks good and balanced on a logo (Some titles are really difficult to make a logo out of)\n\nAnd these are the âgood to have categoriesâ for a good name:\n\nHave something familiar that people recognize\n\nUnique, no other companies/books/bands/... should have it\n\nIs funny or a pun\n\nHas a cool abbreviation\n\nGoes together with the logo or contrasts it\n\nSecondly I made up some names for âa grim reaper simulation gameâ and asked some friends to do that as well. There were over 50 names at first and I went over them seeing if they fit into my âcategoriesâ. This is the longest list one of my really eager friend sent me :)\n\n\"Nothing is more certain than Death and Taxes.\"\n\nSo the name âDeath and Taxesâ fit almost all of my rules (except for 10 and 11). It also had the word âdeathâ in it like I wanted.\n\nI had to make a difficult choice because there was ONE BIG PROBLEM with the name. It is a part of a saying (yay, his is a good thing!), but some other companies have it as well (oh no, this is not a good thing!). So I found out that there was a book, documentary, movie, restaurant, many usernames and even a law firm called Death and Taxes. At that time, there were no games named Death and Taxes and I decided that we can take the risk and hope that we will get enough popularity to show up in the search engines.\n\nA year after naming the game, Magic: The Gathering came out with a card pack called âDeath and Taxesâ and I knew that this could be a problem because now the name is in the virtual game market but at least it wasnât a name for the full game. For a long time, googling or youtube searching for âDeath and Taxes gameâ only gave information about MTG, not our game but we were lucky enough to get more popularity and now all the first results in Google are about our own game(yay!) so everything turned out well in the end.\n\nSo this is the story behind the name!\n\nFeel free to tell me if you have some own rules for naming games or want me to go deeper in some of the rules I mentioned.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nLeene"
