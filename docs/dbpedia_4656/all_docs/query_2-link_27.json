        "text": "The Los Angeles Times's new \"Guidelines on Racial and Ethnic Identification,\" for its writers and editors, bans or restricts some 150 words and phrases such as \"birth defect,\" \"Chinese fire drill,\" \"crazy,\" \"dark continent,\" \"stepchild,\" \"WASP\" and \"to welsh.\"\n\nDefying such politically correct sensibilities, The Economist allows the use of variants of \"he\" for both sexes (as in \"everyone should watch his language\"), and \"crippled\" for disabled people.\n\nOne side says that language insidiously shapes attitudes and that vigilance against subtle offense is necessary to eliminate prejudice. The other bristles at legislating language, seeing a corrosion of clarity and expressiveness at best, and thought control at worst, changing the way reporters render events and opinions.\n\nBoth arguments make assumptions about language and how it relates to thoughts and attitudes -- a connection first made in 1946 by George Orwell in his essay \"Politics and the English Language,\" which suggested that euphemisms, cliches and vague writing could be used to reinforce orthodoxy and defend the indefensible. We understand language and thought better than we did in Orwell's time, and our discoveries offer insights about the P.C. controversy.\n\nFirst, words are not thoughts. Despite the appeal of the theory that language determines thought, no cognitive scientist believes it. People coin new words, grapple for le mot juste, translate from other languages and ridicule or defend P.C. terms. None of this would be possible if the ideas expressed by words were identical to the words themselves. This should alleviate anxiety on both sides, reminding us that we are talking about style manuals, not brain programming.\n\nSecond, words are arbitrary. The word \"duck\" does not look, walk or quack like a duck, but we all know it means duck because we have memorized an arbitrary association between a sound and a meaning.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
