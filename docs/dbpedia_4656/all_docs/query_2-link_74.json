But I think we need to come up with a more creative name.\n\nLike “The Game Where My Husband Forever Became Buzz Lightyear”\n\nor “The Game Where People Yell Really Loud For Some Reason”\n\nHere is what you need:\n\nA bowl\n\nScissors\n\nPaper\n\nAnd something for everyone to write with\n\noh… and a stopwatch – we usually use someone’s phone\n\nCut up the paper into slips and divide them evenly amongst everyone\n\n5-10 slips per person\n\nThen have everyone write down 1 name per slip of paper\n\nThey can be dead or alive, fiction or real\n\nYou just don’t want to write down a name in which you are the only person in the room who knows who that person is\n\nHere are some examples\n\nThen fold up every piece once and put them in the bowl\n\nNow divide everyone up into 2 groups\n\nSit in a circle, and sit so you are between members of the other team\n\nThere are 3 rounds to this game\n\nRound 1\n\nGive the bowl to 1 person\n\nThey have 30 seconds to try and get their team to guess as many names as they can\n\nThey pull the names out one at a time and they can say anything to give clues to their team (except the name itself)\n\nOnce their team guesses the name, they keep that slip and then they reach in and get another name\n\nOnce 30 seconds is up, they throw whatever name they were currently working on back into the bowl, and then they pass the bowl clockwise and the next person (who is on the other team) does the same thing\n\nEach team should keep a pile of the slips they have guessed\n\nWhen all the names have been guessed, count them up and write down what the round 1 scores are\n\nRound 2\n\nPut the same slips back into the bowl\n\nStart with whatever person would have gone next\n\nAgain, they have 30 seconds to get their team to guess, but THIS time they can only say one word\n\nONLY ONE WORD\n\nIf they say more than one word they have to put it back in the bowl\n\nChoose your one word carefully\n\nWise players will use a word that was said in round 1\n\nWhen the bowl is empty, count up the score and add it to the scores from round 1\n\nRound 3\n\nPut the same slips back into the bowl\n\nStart with whatever person would have gone next\n\nAnd again, they have 30 seconds to get their team to guess – but this time it is Charades – so you act out the name\n\nNo Talking!\n\nAgain, wise players will act out words used in round 1 and 2\n\nWhen the bowl is empty, count up the score and add them up for a final winner\n\nAnd the losing team has to do the dishes."
