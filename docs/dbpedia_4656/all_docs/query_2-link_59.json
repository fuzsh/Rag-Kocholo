        "text": "How depressing!\n\nThis was an extremely big deal in the UK. The first single from their upcoming 5th LP, Abba The Album, it spent a month at #1 almost immediately after it's release. That 1977 was supposedly the year of punk here didn't seem to matter to ABBA who confidently released this 5 minute, mid-tempo classic, sweeping all aside.\n\nThe Name Of The Game is a fantastic song. Layered and complex with a chorus that never seems to end. The vocal arrangements are excellent too. When you grew up with records of this quality it's hard to be bowled over by something like Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do!\n\nOf course, ABBA were one of the best singles bands of the 70s and I'm not sure The Name Of The Game always gets it's due. Dancing Queen will prevail. So, is this song special to you? Did it turn you onto the band or were you there already? For me it shows a lot of growth from their previous hits. What do you think of the song?\n\n\"The Name of the Game\", first called \"A Bit of Myself\", was the first song to be recorded for ABBA's fifth studio album, following the band's European and Australian tour. It was their most complex composition yet – with Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad sharing the lead vocals but with solo passages from both women – and contained the influences of the laid-back California sound of the day.[citation needed]\n\nThe opening riff on bass and synthesizer is inspired by Stevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" from the 1976 album Songs in the Key of Life, and both Andersson and Ulvaeus have acknowledged being inspired by Wonder's music during this part of ABBA's career.[citation needed]\n\nA preliminary version of \"The Name of the Game\" was worked into the 1977 feature film ABBA: The Movie, for which it was written. When it was eventually finished, it was released as the lead single from ABBA: The Album in October 1977. Originally, another track entitled \"Hole in Your Soul\" was intended for release, but those plans were soon shelved. \"The Name of the Game\" was released with a live version of \"I Wonder (Departure)\" as the B-side. This B-side was one of several songs written for the mini-musical The Girl With The Golden Hair, written by Ulvaeus and Andersson and originally performed by ABBA on their 1977 world tour. The recording used on \"The Name of the Game\" single was recorded at Sydney Showground, Sydney, Australia on 3 or 4 March 1977. A studio recorded version of the song was included on ABBA: The Album.\n\n\"The Name of The Game\" also marks the last time Stig Anderson helped with the lyrics of a single.\n\n\"The Name of the Game\" topped the UK Singles Chart for 4 weeks. It was the second of three consecutive UK No. 1 singles after \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\", and before \"Take a Chance on Me\"\n\nThe song was a Top 5 hit in ABBA's native Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa and Rhodesia, while peaking inside the Top 10 in Australia, Germany, Switzerland and Mexico.[6] On the US Billboard Hot 100, \"The Name of the Game\" almost reached the Top 10, peaking at No. 12 on 11–18 March 1978.\n\nAn edited version of \"The Name of the Game\", which omitted the entire second verse of the song, reducing the length of the track from its original 4:51 to 3:58, was released on a promotional single in the US. The US Promo Edit of \"The Name of the Game\" then – apparently by mistake – found its way onto the 1982 Polar Music compilation The Singles: The First Ten Years,[citation needed] and then onto a number of hits packages issued on both vinyl and CD in the 1980s and early 1990s. This edit also appears on the original 1992 version of the group's Gold: Greatest Hits album. Not until the 1999 remastered edition of Gold: Greatest Hits did the song appear in its entirety on that compilation.\n\nWhen PolyGram released the first digitally remastered CD version of The Album in 1997, the fact that one of the nine tracks was nearly a minute shorter than it was supposed to be somehow managed to elude the remastering engineers – the US Promo Edit was again used by mistake and the first edition was subsequently withdrawn.\n\n\"The Name of the Game\" was sampled in 1996 by the Fugees for their hit \"Rumble in the Jungle\", the first time that an ABBA song had been legally sampled by another act.\n\nIn the past few years I've grown fond of the serious/pop-side of Abba and their curious mix of seemingly effortless tunes and intricate arrangements. Together with Knowing Me Knowing You and later singles like Under Attack and Head Over Heels I prefer these to the Voulez Vous/Dancing Queen-type songs. The '70s were Queen and Abba!\n\nMy favourite Abba track and most definitely the one that got me into the band. Heard for the first time back to back with Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights on my radio alarm clock that woke me up at 5.30am one Sunday morning when I was 12 or 13 years old. That bassline. That production. Those voices. That melancholic feeling. The song has stuck with me ever since.\n\nSafe to say whenever I've been 'challenged' over my love for Abba and they're dismissed as Eurovision kitsch this is the track that I ask 'But have you really listened to it?'. Next answer is 'Go and listen to The Visitors'.\n\nThe Name Of The Game certainly hinted at the material they'd do at the end of their run. Like The Visitors and The Day Before You Came.\n\nHard to believe it was the same band who knocked out Dum Dum Diddle the year before.\n\nName of The Game is one of my favourite songs of all time. I simply love Abba, and don't consider them any kind of guilty pleasure. When i was young at school however my eclectic musical tastes were not understood. Queen, Hawkwind, Gong, Abba, Genesis, Gabriel, Pink Floyd, and french space disco music\n\nAgree Name of The Game is a masterclass in songwriting, but then so much of their output is..\n\nThe Album is one of my favourite records too.. Eagle is probably my favourite song by them. I'd heard that at the time of doing The Album they had had a vacation in California, read Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach and were thinking of doing a kind of concept album around those themes of freedom and spirituality. Eagle and Move On are the two tracks from that line of thought that made it through. Obviously lots of other ideas came in and we got what became The Album.\n\nHope we get to hear more of Get On The Carousel one of these days... If you watch Abba The Movie, there GOTC is in there and you can hear some of the Hole In Your Soul melody very clearly.\n\nPeace\n\nJohn"
