The problem is that there is usually very little to no preparation that goes into whatever the thing is before the try happens.\n\nYou want money, fame, a certain lifestyle, and so you hatch an idea and half execute on it. Then, you get frustrated, blame God for not wanting you to have something, and go back to what you were doing before...OR worse, you repeat the cycle with some other project.\n\nThe times that I have heard, \"All we gotta do is\" in relation to starting a business is mind blowing.\n\nI admit that I jumped into starting a business, but when something didn't work (it was inevitable that it wouldn't because I had no clue as to what I was doing), I educated myself. I grew to new levels while in the middle of it. And as I continued to press forward, I learned more.\n\nBe encouraged. The journey is the most valuable thing that you will ever experience. After you do \"the thing\", you'll be ready to move onto something else, because the journey and the learning experiences that come with it, never stops.\n\nKeep going. WHEN you run into a wall, pause, reassess, educate yourself, and get back to it.\n\nLearn more about being intentional and #OnPurpose at www.andrieadenise.com."
