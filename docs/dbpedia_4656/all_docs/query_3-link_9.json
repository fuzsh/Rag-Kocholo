Most of the entrants and other characters in the game have both first name and last name.\n\nMost names are randomly drawn from a set of five lists. There are also several characters who have a fixed name that stays the same every playthrough.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nDiscrepancies in names are identified by comparing names that appear on the documents an entrant presents. If two different names occur, they must be pointed out in the inspection mode. This triggers a brief dialog and brings up an option to check entrant's fingerprints. The fingerprint slip contains known aliases of the entrant, if any. If this does not solve the discrepancy, the entrant can be detained. Name-related discrepancies on documents presented by a single entrant are:\n\nTwo completely different names\n\nCompletely different first or last names\n\nOne-letter difference in either first or last name\n\nThe name field appears in every single document presented with the exception of the ID supplement.\n\nUnnamed characters[]"
