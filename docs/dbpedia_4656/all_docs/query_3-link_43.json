It let’s you change the name but it does not save it, so whenever the reviews of said game come in, it’s still named “Game #7” for example.\n\nI thought that first, but the next time I had to do it, I clicked the tick mark next to the name, and I’m pretty sure it stuck.\n\nDid not for me twice in a row. Second time was on purpose to see if it saved.\n\nYou will need to click the Check Mark next to the name on the right.\n\nYou must confirm the change.\n\nindeed, pressing return/enter doesn’t save it, you have to click the tick.\n\nIn my opinion this works just fine.\n\nHave changed topic from Bug to Question as its WAI.\n\nHit the pencil > Rename > Hit the tick. Done!\n\nInterestingly it works exactly the same in game as it does here on the Discourse forums when you change the coloured category box from one category, or none, to another!\n\nCharlie: I think the bug in question is if you press Enter/return instead of the tick, it acts the same way, but it doesn’t acknowledge the change and the game completes with the old name.\n\nI just tested this and hitting the Enter/Return key does nothing at all, it has no function so therefore could not be confused with actually working in this manner.\n\nWell, it obviously has been confusing people - I guess they assume it works because that’s an expected behaviour for hitting return.\n\nHowever, I suspect people will get used to it. New players will just turn up with the question from time to time."
