        "text": "True but both are the same manufacturer. IIRC, Taito had to change the name due to a lawsuit that Jungle King was too similar to the Tarzan franchise. They lost the suit, so out came the initial yell when starting a game, and the name was changed.\n\nThere are SIX different versions of Jungle King\n\nJungle King (earliest version)\n\nJungle King (second version) - Used a different audio CPU. The Tarzan yell was replaced with a lion roar and a chimpanzee scream, the monkey sounds were made lower-pitched, and the ending music was completely replaced. All of the changes made in this version (except for the Tarzan yell) were also carried over to the later versions.\n\nJungle King (third version) - Fixed several glitches. The monkeys were replaced with gorillas, and the cannibals were recolored green (they used natural skin tones in the older versions). This was the first version released internationally.\n\nJungle Hunt - The copyright on the title screen says \"TAITO AMERICA CORP\" instead of \"TAITO CORPORATION\", the Tarzan character was replaced with an explorer, the Tarzan yell was completely removed, and the vines were replaced with ropes.\n\nJungle Hunt (Brazil) - The copyright on the title screen says \"TAITO DO BRASIL\" instead of \"TAITO CORPORATION\", the copyright year was updated to 1983, the explorer was changed back to the Tarzan character, the Tarzan yell was added back in, the gorillas were changed back to monkeys, the monkey sounds were changed back to the original pitch, the ropes were changed back to vines, the HUD was disabled on the cannibal stage, the ending music was replaced with the original ending music, and almost all of the ingame text was translated to Portugese.\n\nPirate Pete - A completely rethemed version of the game. Although the gameplay remains identical, all of the jungle-themed graphics were replaced with pirate-themed graphics."
