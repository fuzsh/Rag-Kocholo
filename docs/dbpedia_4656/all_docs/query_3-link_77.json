Dismantling bench, unconscious player backpack inventory shows empty, even though its not‚Ä¶\n\nThats all came with so called: ‚Äúupdate‚Äù\n\nI apologize. You have few good points there.\n\nI thought when I asked question how old is this game. The answer would be:\n\nIt didn‚Äôt happen in that time, so probably it wont happen now and thats about it.\n\nThe rest was just few examples, of things that were good and changed to worse.\n\nI did not want to upset anyone"
