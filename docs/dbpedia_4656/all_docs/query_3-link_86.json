        "text": "New feature if you have it checked in settings is Streamer name block. What it does and changes your battle net name to something random so other players can’t see your true name.\n\nIf you don’t have that activated, then I’m talking out my butt lol.\n\nyeah the new “hide my name” thing basically replaces Streamer Mode and does what you said, so if that was turned on before, it’s probably still turned on but now it changes your name in-game for everyone."
