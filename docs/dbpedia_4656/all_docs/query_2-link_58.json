        "text": "Hello yall. My question is simple: What’s a good name for a game that looks like this?\n\nProbably the name of a city. Many town games are titled the name of the city or town (ex. Bloxburg, Brookhaven).\n\nI’m thinking it can be called “Polygon City”. It’s not too generic like what you would think of “Bloxville”, “Robloxia”, “Bloxburg”, whatever.\n\nPolygon City is the name of the pack of models he is sharing.\n\nno. Polygon city is not the name of the pack of models haha. It’s “polygon city pack”\n\nbut tbh, polygon city isn’t bad. I’ll wait on more replied though. Btw: I would like it if yall could give me bright names!\n\nMind you: In this game, you can do… well, anything?\n\nSo yeah. Think of a name for that, if that doesn’t bother all yall!\n\nI think that Polygonia is a cool name.\n\nnot gonna lie, but it’s kinda weird to pronounce.\n\n‘PolyCity Life’\n\nMost epic and generic name I could think of.\n\nAren’t these photos part of the Polygon City Pack, made for Unreal Engine 4?\n\nThey are. Read the title: What’s a good name for a game that LOOKS like this?\n\nMy team recreated the pack. We do not use direct assets.\n\nCool!\n\nIn that case, one of MasterSapphireFrost’s suggestions, in opinion, i like ‘Poly World’.\n\nPolyCity is an ok name to me but im not really sure its more if i play the game i could come up with a better name. But im guessing this cannot be played.\n\nGrand Theft Angles IV since the game looks like its from GTA\n\nwell, we’re making a game that looks quite similar to this, and perhaps exactly like this.\n\n@coolguyweir Good luck on it\n\n(This is now the required length )"
