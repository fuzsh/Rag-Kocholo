We will get to it some day. This blog and our love of Nabokov will not end any time soon. I digress.\n\nWe also think it will be interesting to read about the woman behind the man, who supported and shaped the many literary works that we love. It will be a fascinating lens in which to examine our dear beloved Uncle. Feel free to join us.\n\nLIFE AND LETTERS about the partnership of Vladimir Nabokov and his wife, Vera, who was, at the very least, his assistant and muse. Vladimir Nabokov taught at Cornell from 1948 to 1959; in class, Vera sat in the front row or, more often, on the dais. She occasionally taught when Vladimir was sick, and often proctored exams. The man who spoke so often of his isolation was, at Cornell especially, in the constant company of his wife. Vera Nabokov was a striking woman, white-haired and alabaster-skinned."
