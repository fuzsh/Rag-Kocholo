        "text": "Véra and Vladimir Nabokov were married for fifty-two years—a record, apparently, among literary couples—and their intimacy was nearly hermetic. When they were apart, he pined for her grievously. She was his first reader, his agent, his typist, his archivist, his translator, his dresser, his money manager, his mouthpiece, his muse, his teaching assistant, his driver, his bodyguard (she carried a pistol in her handbag), the mother of his child, and, after he died, the implacable guardian of his legacy. Vladimir dedicated nearly all his books to her, and Véra famously saved “Lolita” from incineration in a trash can when he wanted to destroy it. Before they moved from a professor’s lodgings in Ithaca, New York, to a luxury hotel in Switzerland, she kept his house—“terribly,” by her own description—and cooked his food. She stopped short of tasting his meals when they dined out, but she opened his mail, and answered it.\n\nAccording to Véra’s biographer, Stacy Schiff, her subject had such a fetish for secrecy that she “panicked every time she saw her name in [Vladimir’s] footnotes.” It seems inapt to call Véra’s love selfless, however: the two selves of the Nabokovs were valves of the same heart. And extravagant devotion may sometimes be the expression of vicarious grandiosity. Schiff’s biography won a Pulitzer Prize in 2000, and Véra’s name has since entered English as an eponym. Last year, an article on The _Atlantic _’s Web site concluded that the luckiest scribes are those married to “a Véra,” a spouse of either sex who liberates them from life’s mundane chores; the less fortunate long for a Véra between loads at the laundromat. There is also the option of a paid Véra, for writers of means—or of scruples.\n\n“Letters to Véra,” the first complete volume of Nabokov’s letters to his wife, was published by Knopf this month. A lifetime of scholarship informs this massive tome, which was edited and translated from the Russian by Olga Voronina and Brian Boyd, Nabokov’s definitive biographer. Its heft, however, is grossly lopsided. The period between 1923, when the couple met, and 1940, when they escaped with their six-year-old son, Dmitri, from France to New York, generated four-fifths of the correspondence. The remaining thirty-seven years, until Nabokov’s death, fill barely eighty of five hundred pages. (There are two hundred and sixty-eight additional pages of appendices and endnotes.) Because all but one of his novels in English were composed in America—“I’m an American writer,” he insisted when he was asked to define his literary identity—the most fertile decades of his career, and of Véra’s midwifery, play out offstage.\n\nWe do get a self-portrait of the young Vladimir unvarnished by Nabokovian irony. The earliest letters, intoxicated with language and desire, are intoxicating to read. A ball rolls under a chair, the only furniture in a room: “things seem to have some sort of survival instinct.” Trying to quit cigarettes, Nabokov imagines the angels smoking in Heaven like guilty schoolboys. When the archangel passes, they throw their cigarettes away, and “this is what falling stars are.” From Paris, he describes the Métro: “It stinks like between the toes and it’s just as cramped.”\n\nNabokov’s ambition, as a young man, was to give Véra “a sunny, simple happiness,” a rare enough commodity for Russians of their generation. They were born three years apart—he in 1899, she in 1902—and they spent their youth outrunning the murderous upheavals of the twentieth century. Many of their compatriots lost their bearings, and would never recover. But each of them found a lodestar in the other.\n\nVéra Evseevna Slonim was born into a rich Jewish family that fled St. Petersburg during the Revolution and settled in Berlin, the de-facto first capital of the anti-Bolshevik diaspora. She was pale and fine-boned, with the huge eyes of a waif. Her elegance in speech and dress rivalled that of her husband. He liked to joke that he had turned her hair white prematurely; it gave her an ethereal aura that belied her toughness. Véra’s character, Vladimir told her, was made of “tiny sharp arrows.”\n\nAfter the Slonims reached Berlin, Véra’s father, a lawyer, founded a publishing house. It was one of eighty-six that served a community of half a million émigrés who were religious about their Russianness. Véra worked in the office. She and her two sisters had been polished and educated to a high standard, mostly at home. “They were raised to be perfect,” a nephew recalled. To be perfect was to marry well. In the meantime, she taught English and translated from several languages. Some of her work was published in the journal Rul, the most prestigious of the outlets for writers in exile. One of its star contributors was a young aristocrat, ladies’ man, chess player, dandy, and lepidopterist who was earning his living as a private tutor. He signed his poetry with the pseudonym V. Sirin, but literary insiders, including Véra, knew his real name.\n\nOn May 8, 1923, Véra Slonim and Vladimir Nabokov met at a charity ball, or so he recalled. Schiff sets their meeting on a bridge, “over a chestnut-lined canal.” All accounts, including Véra’s, agree that she was hiding her features behind a black harlequin mask that she refused to lift as they meandered through the city to the Hohenzollernplatz, rapt in conversation. The mask suggests audacious premeditation. Had Véra “accosted” Sirin, as Boyd describes it? Was this an audition for which she had studied the role? And had she come with the “venerating expectation” that George Eliot attributes to Dorothea Brooke before her first meeting with Casaubon?\n\nNabokov later told his sister that Véra had indeed arranged the encounter. Véra refused to speak for herself to posterity. But she did admit to having memorized Sirin’s verse, including his love poems to another woman, and she recited it to him in a voice that he found “exquisite.” The writer was seduced with his own words. They were married two years later.\n\nOn the evidence of these letters, no couple ever enjoyed a more perfect complicity. In his very first sentence, Vladimir tells Véra, “I won’t hide it. I’m so unused to being—well, understood.” In 1924, he reflects, “You know, we are terribly alike.” And a few months later: “You and I are so special; the miracles we know, no one knows, and no one loves the way we love.” He was ready to give her “all of my blood.” Through their decades of vicissitudes, he referred to their marriage as “cloudless”—even to his mistress.\n\nAs the years pass, however, and the “radiance” of his passion dims, Nabokov is increasingly consumed with practical matters. By the nineteen-thirties, he seems too preoccupied to take pains with his style. For a writer who labored over his prose, that negligence—hasty sentences full of repetition—may be just a little luxury, like his cigarettes, that he knew Véra would indulge. But the substance has changed, too. There is less about his art, except for the effort to publish it, and more about his digestion. He struggles as a stateless person to obtain visas, and “our letters,” he laments, degenerate into “bureaucratic reports.” Long passages are devoted to his social rounds, a recitation, for the most part, of obscure Russian names. Perhaps Nabokov did not wish to trouble his “Pussykins” with unpleasantries like the rise of Fascism; he mentions Hitler exactly twice. On April 7, 1939, the day Mussolini invaded Albania, Nabokov is strolling in a London park, where the yellow pansies “have Hitler faces.” A few days later, he spends a morning with a fellow-lepidopterist. “We talked about everything, starting with the genitalia of Hesperiidae”—a family* of butterfly—“and ending with Hitler.”\n\nBoyd and Schiff both drew upon these letters for their biographies, so they contain few surprises, except for the revelation—a disconcerting one, for a lover of Nabokov’s fiction—that he could be a bore. Here, for example, he prepares for a reading in Paris:\n\nI had a great shave and began to dress. It turned out that the sleeves of my tuxedo were too short, that is, that the cuffs of the beautiful silk shirt of the same provenance stuck out too far. Besides, the belt was peeking out from underneath the vest when I stood up straight. So Amalia Osipovna quickly had, first of all, to make me those, you know, armbands, out of elastic and Zenzinov had to give me his suspenders. . . . When all of that had been sorted, I looked very smart.\n\nHe goes on to relate his dinner with Amalia and Zenzinov, his consumption of an eggnog, their arrival, by cab, at the “packed” hall on the Rue Las Cases, and the fatigue induced by having to smile at so many admirers. He loses track of their names, but he does record the gratifying presence of important writers and “thousands” of ladies—“in a word, everyone.” When the reading finally gets under way, he opens his briefcase—a “very nice” one borrowed from a friend—and spreads out his papers. After a sip of water from a handy carafe, he begins to recite. The acoustics are “magnificent,” and every poem is greeted with rapturous applause. The account continues for four pages.\n\nThere is little doubt that Mrs. Nabokov took a keen interest in her husband’s every triumph, toothache, and fried egg. But it is also possible to imagine that, in bleak moments, she tired of his endearments (“my little sunshine”), bridled at his pet names (“lumpikin”), and resented the ostentation of a love that can be hard to distinguish from self-infatuation (“It’s as if in your soul there is a prepared spot for every one of my thoughts”).\n\nWe will never know, however, what Véra felt. She systematically destroyed her own letters to Vladimir, and even blacked out the lines she had added on their postcards to his mother. At best, she was a fitful correspondent. Vladimir’s frustration with her epistolary reticence is a constant theme—“Pussykins, you write disgustingly rarely to me.” Boyd marvels at Nabokov’s tolerance “of what many in his position might have seen as a failure of . . . reciprocity.”\n\nFailures in a marriage, however, tend to be reciprocal. “When I think about you, I get so happy and light,” Vladimir exults to Véra, in 1926, “and since I think about you always, I am always happy and light.” He surrenders to this trance of buoyancy at a moment when Véra, a newlywed, has been sent to a sanatorium—against her will, it seems—to recover from depression and weight loss. In response to a “sad little letter” in which she seems to have begged for release from her incarceration, he tells her, “Understand this, my love, none of us wants to see you till you’re completely well and rested. I beg you, my love, for my sake shrug off all that gloom. . . . Think what I must feel knowing things are bad for you.”\n\nNabokov’s uxorious complacence reaches its low point in the spring of 1937, the “darkest and most painful” year of the marriage, as Boyd puts it. Vladimir’s sexual charisma was legendary, and Véra was aware of his womanizing before she married him, thanks, in part, to a list of some thirty paramours he had provided, on her father’s letterhead, early in their courtship. She had caught him on the rebound, four months after the end of his engagement to a rich beauty of seventeen. (The girl’s parents had become alarmed at Nabokov’s prospects and, evidently, at his morals; he had shared his diary with their daughter, who hurled it across the room.)\n\nEarlier that year, Schiff tells us, Véra had received an anonymous letter, written in French but “patently from a Russian.” She was in Berlin with Dmitri while Vladimir was in Paris, romancing publishers, and the letter informed her that her husband was besotted with a blond divorcée named Irina Guadanini, a vivacious flirt from St. Petersburg who earned her living as a part-time dog groomer. Véra confronted her husband with the rumor, and he shrugged it off. “I forbid you to be miserable,” he tells her in March. “There’s no power in the world that could take away or spoil even an inch of this endless love.” (He has recently mentioned a rendezvous with Irina at La Coupole; he wants Véra to know that in the course of their meal he misplaced but recovered the top to his precious fountain pen.)\n\nAs spring approaches, the couple spar over vacation plans, she insisting on a Czech resort and he on a beach house in the South of France. “You make me anxious and cross,” he scolds—she is being intransigent. And a little later: “My dear love, all the Irinas in the world are powerless. . . . You should not let yourself go like this.” And then in April: “My darling, your muddle-headedness is absolutely killing me. What’s really going on?” What’s going on, we learn from Schiff, is that Nabokov is enjoying torrid sex with his worshipful mistress while lying to his wife about ending the affair. He suffers not a little shame, yet tells Irina he can’t live without her. He even hints that he will leave Véra—given time. And, in letters that might have made a fascinating appendix, he extolls his and Irina’s uncanny compatibility in suspiciously familiar prose. “For the more mortal among us,” Schiff observes, “there is cold comfort in the idea that even Nabokov could not coax two entire vocabularies out of reckless passion.”\n\n“It is the work of the artist,” Nietzsche wrote, “that invents the man who created it. ‘Great men’ as they are venerated are subsequent pieces of minor fiction.” Biographers do well to heed this caution, and so do Véras. It might have been the epigraph for “Pale Fire.”\n\nBoyd calls Véra “an expert at blanket denial.” In the late nineteen-sixties, Andrew Field proposed to write Nabokov’s biography. Vladimir and Véra both welcomed the project, though they were wary of Field’s prying, and Boyd speculates that she destroyed her letters to protect their contents. When Véra read a manuscript of the book, in 1973, she objected to what she considered a lifeless and distorted portrait. “After close to 48 years of life together,” she told Field, “I can swear that I have never once heard [Nabokov] utter a cliché or a banality.”"
