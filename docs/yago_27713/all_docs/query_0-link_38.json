        "text": "Vera (Mrs Vladimir Nabokov)\n\nStacy Schiff\n\nPicador £25, pp456\n\nDuring recent Nabokov centennial celebrations, mandarin passions and academic pedantry, notably north American, ran riot. Acolytes and impassioned scrutineers offered their findings on 'Tropes of Transparency'; 'Nabokov, \"snobizm\" and the representations of the self'; on 'The Flight of Icarus and Daedalus' in the master's works; on 'Nabokov, Mach and Monism at the Turn of the Century'; on the possible relations of Lolita or Pale Fire or Glory to Tolstoy, Pushkin, Yeats, Proust or T.S. Eliot. Parallels were adduced between the philosophies of memory in Bergson and Nabokov's successive memoirs. A 2,000-page commentary on Ada, an often prurient and arguably botched torso, is in progress. Armadas of monographs and doctoral dissertations are hoisting sail.\n\nThe reason for this plethora lies not only with the manifest fascination exercised by Vladimir Nabokov's brilliantly assembled persona and the diversity, volume and singular genius of much of his writings. It reflects the almost uncanny concordance between these writings and the very nature of the academic enterprise.\n\nNabokov wrote in at least three main tongues - French, Russian, Anglo-American - and wove another dozen languages, including those of entymology and botany, into his polyglot virtuosity. There is scarcely a line in his poetry or corruscating paragraph in his prose not crammed with allusions, cross-reference, calculated (often arcanely, cunningly misleading) echo. Acrostics, anagrams, palindromes, puns, neologisms, spangle the many layered confections of his style.\n\nMore even than Joyce, the art of Nabokov invites, challenges and derides, with degrees of amused hauteur, the febrile labours, the servile ingenuities of the learned decoder.\n\nMoreover, in the leviathan minutiae of Nabokov's notes to his questionable but crucial 'translation' of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, the Nabokovians have before them a never-to-be equalled, let alone surpassed, exhibition of their own byzantine craft and aspirations. Even the Nabokov index to Onegin is a minefield of multilingual traps, clues and Ariadne's threads in a labyrinth of dizzying complexity. And a real Minotaur sits at its imaginary heart.\n\nThe master's sarcasm, his contempt for those inadequately endowed to penetrate, let alone judge, his work, was legend. As were his magisterially dismissive verdicts on such vulgar frauds as Dostoevsky, Freud, Faulkner or Balzac.\n\nIt may take generations to unravel what there is in these celebrated damnations of deliberate provocation and what there is of autonomous insight. The allowed pantheon is small: Flaubert, Gogol, Pushkin, Proust and Joyce. Where a potential rival looms, the mechanisms of defensive denigration are almost instantaneous. Nabokov on Pasternak does not make for pleasant reading.\n\nThe facts of enforced emigration, of successive exile and precarious refuge, the violent deaths of Nabokov's father and brother at the hands of totalitarian thugs, the sense of a miraculous at-homeness in Russia and Russian now lost, may help explain Olympian ironies and a fierce privacy (sacrificed, however, when the books, and Lolita above all, were to be hyped internationally).\n\nWhen fame and wealth came, overnight as it were, they left in their wake decades of misery, of non-recognition outside a small circle, of academic jobbery. Now resplendent vengeance lay to hand and the role of Nabokov's wife, Vera, was of the very first importance. It is doubtful whether he could have endured either the long years of material and psychological constraint or the sun-burst of high fortune without the magic of a 52-year marriage to an utterly remarkable woman.\n\nStacy Schiff chronicles this welding with admiring warmth. She tells of the almost immediate infatuation and sense of destined unity experienced by the lovers in Berlin in 1923. Schiff is somewhat more revelatory of the crisis in the summer of 1937 (Nabokov had fallen wildly in love, probably not for the first nor last time during his marriage) than any previous chronicler. We learn of Vera's absolutely decisive part in the production and publication of Lolita, whose origins go back to a novella of 1939, and which a disheartened author was on the point of consigning to ash.\n\nVera was tireless as translator, editor, agent, Praetorian Guard. But as Schiff urges, her participation in Nabokov's linguistic experiments, in his conviction of imminent celebrity, was indispensable.\n\nThe unity of views between them, the phrases they would resort to simultaneously, as it were, across a crowded gathering, struck witnesses as uncanny. For Vera no doubt, was allowed. As she wrote to a wretched biographer: 'After close to 48 years of life together I can swear I never once heard him utter a cliché or a banality. This is the central point of his life and you have managed to miss it completely.' Those bold enough to dissent, even partially, from adulation felt that they had to apologise to Vera and plead for her intercession.\n\nAfter Nabokov's death in July 1977, Vera lived out her term with stoic elegance and in indefatigable service to her husband's work. Their son Dimitri suffered an appalling car crash. Vera's strength was failing. Death, in 1991, must have come as a relief.\n\nThe overall contours of Nabokov's biography have been available for some time. The secondary literature on his vexed but ultimately imperial dealings with publishers, agents, translators and the media is already extensive. Schiff's handsomely written portrait provides fresh angles of incidence, but not very much that is new.\n\nIt is being bruited among the worker-ants that there are in this book many factual errors. The paperback, one is told, will be duly amended. Does the road of excess always lead to wisdom? Does it throw light on the truly important questions concerning the metamorphic genesis of Nabokov's English, learnt in childhood, into the baroque, marvellously strange American of Lolita or of the pastiche-poem in Pale Fire. How right was the Soviet encyclopedia, when it insisted Nabokov was 'an American novelist'?"
