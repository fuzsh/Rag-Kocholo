        "text": "In early May 1923 the Russian émigré community of Berlin threw a charity ball. The young poet Vladimir Sirin was approached by a woman wearing a black harlequin mask. She tantalised him by reciting his verse from memory. They wandered the streets long into the night, entranced by each other. This is one of the stories of how Vladimir Nabokov and Véra Slonim met: one disguised by a pseudonym, the other by a mask.\n\nNabokov left for the south of France shortly after this encounter. He went to work as a farm labourer, hoping that hard graft would ease his suffering; he was grieving for his father, a democrat who had been murdered the previous year while trying to protect a political rival from assassination, and he had been left heartbroken when his fiancée dumped him (her parents didn’t rate his prospects).\n\nThe meeting at the Berlin ball stayed with him. From France he wrote a poem about meeting a mysterious masked woman on a bridge over a canal lined with chestnut trees and published it in a journal he knew she would read. A month later he wrote his first letter to her: “I won’t hide it: I’m so unused to being – well, understood, perhaps – so unused to it, that in the very first minutes of our meeting I thought: this is a joke, a masquerade trick… But then… And there are things that are hard to talk about – you rub off their marvellous pollen with the touch of a word…”\n\nNabokov had not been deceived: this was the beginning of one of the most enduring partnerships in the history of literature. Until Nabokov’s death in 1977, Véra was his lover, wife, the mother of his son, his editor, researcher, translator, administrator, champion, protector and his collaborator. She indulged his passion for the hunting and cataloguing of butterflies. When she filled out her American tax return, she described herself as his assistant. When he decided to burn the manuscript of Lolita, she saved it from the flames. When Nabokov kept a dream diary in the Sixties he recorded one in which he played the piano while Véra turned the pages of the score.\n\nShe did all this with determined self-effacement. Even before meeting Nabokov, she was convinced he was the greatest writer of his generation and she did everything in her power to facilitate his genius. That meant giving up any literary ambitions she may have had – she had published several poetic translations in the early Twenties – in the service of furthering his.\n\nNabokov’s letters to Véra, translated from the Russian and published for the first time in a handsome and meticulously edited edition, provide insight, therefore, into the unfolding of Nabokov’s considerable talent. It has been a collaborative production, driven by the doyen of Nabokov scholarship, Brian Boyd, and assisted by Olga Voronina, of Bard College. Nabokov’s son, Dmitri, who died in 2012, was involved in the early stages before his health deteriorated.\n\nHere, then, we have Nabokov writing for his first and most important reader. While some of the material has been quoted or paraphrased before, in Boyd’s biographies of Nabokov, and in Stacy Schiff’s biography of Véra, this is Nabokov uncut. Yet Véra’s side of the correspondence is silent: so developed was her sense of privacy that she destroyed every letter she wrote to him. Only his words should survive into posterity, she felt.\n\nSo rarely were the Nabokovs apart that the letters come in concentrated bursts, often with years between them. The letters of the Twenties chart Nabokov’s pursuit of Véra and their early blissful years of marriage. The bulk of the correspondence comes from the mid-to-late Thirties when Nabokov was spending weeks and months alone in Paris, Brussels and London, looking for a job to try to get his family out of Nazi Berlin. The last extended period he spent away from his wife was in the early Forties in America, when he went on a lecture tour of the Deep South and the Midwest.\n\nThe early letters are the richest, the most lyrical. Nabokov comes on strong, with the earnest tendresse of the poet in love (not to mention the menagerie of preposterous pet-names: “Goosikins”, “Pussykins”, “Monkeykins”). But he is also discovering himself as a prose writer, and you can see him testing things out on this new reader who sees the world as he sees it. In the first letters from his summer in the south of France, he delights in their compatibility: “you are the only person I can talk with about the shade of a cloud, about the song of a thought – and about how, when I went out to work today and looked a tall sunflower in the face, it smiled at me with all of its seeds.”\n\nVéra became his audience and his aesthetic barometer. “I cannot write a word without hearing how you will pronounce it,” he writes in one letter. “I can talk about all this only to you,” he writes in another.\n\nIn the years before publishing his first novel, Mary, in 1926, Véra becomes the testing ground for his emerging ideas about art and literature. “I am becoming more and more firmly convinced that art is the only thing that matters in life,” he writes to her. “I am ready to endure Chinese torture to find a single epithet.” He rereads Madame Bovary – “the most brilliant novel in world literature” – and finds it “the only book which, in three places, makes me feel hot under my eyeballs”.\n\nAs the letters progress, Nabokov becomes more recognisably Nabokovian. In Freiburg he notes the “silky rainy murmur” of crows “as they fly low and spread out among the firs”. In Kent, the sheep are “grey suede”. On the London Underground the escalators descend like an “iron waterfall”. Arriving by train in Paris he sees “the Eiffel Tower standing in lacy bloomers, with lit-up goose bumps running up her spine”. In the same city, on the Metro, he tells Véra that he asked a conductor about what was in the stone steps that made them sparkle “like the play of quartz in granite”. The conductor, “with unusual eagerness”, duly gives Nabokov “les honneurs du Métro” by showing him “where to stand and how to look to enjoy the glitter at its best: if I described this, people would say I made it up”.\n\nTeasing beauty out of the banal is typical Nabokov, but so is the fascination with the ugly, the violent and the perverse. He writes to Véra in 1926 to tell her that her father had read and enjoyed one of his stories (“A Nursery Tale”), “but he finds that I 'specialise in risqué subjects’ ”.\n\nNabokov gleefully tells Véra about encounters with the aberrant or the grotesque. At one literary salon in Belgium he reports meeting a poet, “his nose a net of purple veins”, who is famous “because as a youth he snacked on human flesh”. The poet, whose father worked for the railroad, saw someone run over by the train and “hurrying desperately, ate a piece of the half-severed leg… A poet, he told me, should experience everything.”\n\nIn later letters, Véra is treated to Nabokov’s description of his mouth flooding with blood and pus after a failed dental intervention and given a vivid account of the food poisoning he suffered while she was out of town (“absolutely Homeric retching”).\n\nThe letters of the Thirties are much more pragmatic than the heady missives of the previous decade. Nabokov is no longer showing off to his young wife but trying to find work and make connections, mainly in Paris and London. Amid the pursuit of visas and the chasing up of editors and publishers, there can be found some remarkable pen portraits.\n\nJoyce, who attends one of Nabokov’s readings in 1937, is “taller than I thought, with a terrible leaden stare”. Ulysses was, for Nabokov, one of the four masterpieces of the 20th century (the others were the first half of Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, Kafka’s Metamorphosis and Bely’s Petersburg), but what interests him in this meeting is Joyce’s ocular travails. “With one eye he can’t see at all,” he writes, “while the pupil of the other (which he points at you in a special way, because he can’t rotate it) is replaced with a hole, they had to operate six times before they managed to drill the pupil without causing a haemorrhage.”\n\nNabokov describes lunch with H G Wells, Zamyatin’s funeral and how Bunin, looking like “a wasted old tortoise”, hissed drunkenly at him that he would “die alone and in horrible agony”. Norman Douglas is dismissed as a “malicious pederast” (these letters underline what we already knew: that Nabokov’s attitude to homosexuality was, like his attitude to “women writers”, at its best “of its time” and at its worst downright unpleasant).\n\nRunning around Paris, Nabokov’s social circle is at odds with his material poverty. He had lost his wealth in the revolution but not his aristocratic contacts. It is bizarre, when he was living hand to mouth, to read him mull over whether or not to borrow a friend’s castle near Perpignan for the summer. After one reading in Brussels, he is encouraged to send his story to the King of Belgium.\n\nStill he can’t get a job and he struggles. There are some surprising roads not taken. He was sounded out about teaching at Eton or working for the intelligence service. He put a huge amount of energy into trying to get a teaching position at the University of Leeds. He was rejected.\n\nIn 1937, the tone of the letters change. The need to leave Berlin was imperative and judging from Nabokov’s replies, Véra was getting increasingly impatient with her husband’s lack of success. Nabokov was suffering desperately with psoriasis, waking up to blood-soaked linen and unable to tame “the monstrous itch”. Only after he had recovered from the worst could he tell Véra “that because of the sufferings – indescribable – that I endured before that treatment [with sun lamps], I’d reached the border of suicide – which they wouldn’t let me cross because of you in my luggage”.\n\nThere is more. Early in 1937 Nabokov had begun an affair with Irina Guadanini, an aspiring poet. Someone clearly tipped off Véra as Nabokov’s letters become defensive and deceptive. “I forbid you to be miserable,” he wrote. “I love you and… there’s no power in the world that could take away or spoil even an inch of this endless love. And if I miss a letter for a day it’s only because I absolutely can’t cope with the crookedness and twists of time I’m living in now. I love you.”\n\nIn many of the early letters, Nabokov pleads with Véra to write more, finding their correspondence “one-sided”. So the drop off in his letters was a clue that all was not right. When Véra apparently confronted him directly about Irina, he held his line. “My dear love, all the Irinas in the world are powerless…” he wrote. “You should not let yourself go like that. The eastern side of my every minute is already coloured by the light of our meeting soon. All the rest is dark, boring, you-less.”\n\nAs Nabokov was reassuring his wife in Berlin, he fell more deeply for his mistress in Paris. This is far from his most glorious episode. Véra’s health was not good, she was looking after their four-year-old son, Dmitri, and, furthermore, she was Jewish and the Nuremberg Laws had been in effect since 1935. She had witnessed a book burning and the previous year lost her job with a law firm when the Jewish owners were forced out. Leaving was imperative, but the situation made her reluctant to go to Paris or even France.\n\nFrom Nabokov’s continued defensiveness, we can infer that Véra continued to push Nabokov on the affair, apparently detailing for him the rumours she was hearing about what he was up to. “The same rumours have reached me,” he replied, “and I didn’t doubt that they would slither over to Berlin, too. The slippery mugs of those who spread them ought to be smashed!”\n\nThe correspondence for 1937 ends with Nabokov still lying to Véra. As we know from Boyd and from Schiff, Nabokov eventually confessed that summer, when they were staying on the French Riviera. Irina came down to confront him when he tried to break off the affair. There was, according to Schiff, a “spasm of violent arguments”, but Véra prevailed. When the letters resume, Nabokov assures Véra that women he meets are “old and fat” and warns her against dropping “dark hints”.\n\nThey would seldom be apart after their reconciliation and, as such, the letters dried up. There are, for example, only two letters between 1945 and 1964 (both written in 1954), the period when Nabokov published the novels Bend Sinister, Lolita, Pnin and Pale Fire and the first version of his memoir. The most substantive and interesting material from the American years comes from his lecture tour in autumn 1942, which gave him a crash course in parts of America few visitors travelled to.\n\nIn South Carolina, where he lectured at Coker College, he was enraptured by the local flora. “It is hard to convey the bliss,” he wrote, “of roaming through this strange bluish grass, between blossoming bushes (one bush here is in bright berries, as if dyed in a cheap Easter purple – an utterly shocking chemical hue, but the main tree in the area is some very tender pine).”\n\nThe biologist and the aesthete might have relished the natural richness of the south, but he was not blind to the social disparity. He notes that the wealth of the college’s founders is down to the cotton plantations and registers his disgust with the word “darkies”, an “expression that jars on me, reminding me distantly of the patriarchal 'Yid’ of western Russian landowners”.\n\nIn the same series of letters he tells Véra, “if it weren’t for the two of you – I have felt this perfectly clearly – I’d have gone to Morocco as a soldier”. This was 1942 after all but these kinds of reference to a larger historical reality are rare in these letters. Nabokov almost never mentions what is going on in Germany in his letters of the Thirties and it is easy to forget that he and Véra lived through the Russian Revolution and the rise of the Nazis in Germany. Part of the allure of Morocco, it turns out, though, is that “there’s a heavenly lycaenid in the mountains there”. Even fighting the good fight would not mean an end to the butterfly hunting.\n\nThe last little burst of letters came when Nabokov went ahead on a holiday to Taormina in Italy in 1970. He extols the luxuries of the hotel and complains about there being too many Germans. By then Nabokov was, according to Boyd, “probably the most famous writer alive”. From the Montreux Palace Hotel in Switzerland, where they spent the rest of their lives after arriving in 1961, Véra handled almost all of his correspondence and collaborated on the creation of Nabokov’s public persona, with his jowly hauteur and quotable put-downs. The mysterious woman in the mask had, 50 years on, helped her husband fashion one of his own.\n\nThose letters written before he started worrying about his public – that is, before Lolita made him famous – allow us to pry behind that mask and get the odd glimpse of the younger Nabokov in the raw. Véra, however, remains silent and elusive. When teaching in the Fifties, Nabokov would tell his students, in reference to his beloved Flaubert, that the best author is “ideally unobtrusive” and that “he remains diffused through the book so that his very absence becomes a kind of radiant presence. As the French say, il brille par son absence — 'he shines by his absence’.” That just might be the best way to think about Véra’s presence in the poems, the novels and these letters: shining by her absence."
