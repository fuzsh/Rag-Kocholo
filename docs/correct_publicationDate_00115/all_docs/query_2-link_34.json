        "text": "… Or why EU fans and Star Wars.com are equally annoying.\n\nThe sudden passing of Dave Wolverton on January 14, had many star warriors reminiscing about the first time they ever read his 1994 novel, The Courtship of Princess Leia. Around the same time Star Wars.com published an article called Star Wars Inside Intel: The Nightsisters. Written by Emily Shkoukani, a member of the Lucasfilm Story Group (whose job is to “know as much about a galaxy far, far away as possible”), the article committed this original sin:\n\n“Making their canon debut in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated television series the Nightsisters were eccentric witches residing on the distant, rocky world of Dathomir. In the show’s episode aptly titled “Nightsisters,” fans first encountered the mystifying culture of these witches.”\n\nThis got many EU fans in a tizzy for ignoring the fact that Dave Wolverton created the Nightsisters and the planet Dathomir first and they expressed their grievances on Twitter, prompting the author to update her article and apologize for the error.\n\nPredictably, this glaring error, also brought out the knives on Dave Filoni and the Clone Wars cartoon for “butchering” the EU.\n\nYes, it was stupid and lazy on Lucasfilm’s part to ignore the contributions Wolverton gave to Star Wars (and considering that the author lists her pronouns as they/she, this should come as no surprise) especially on the heels of his death. But does that give fans the right to bash Filoni at the same time for re-introducing the force-wielding witches to a wider audience? No. George Lucas created and produced Star Wars: The Clone Wars, he has the right to override the EU if he wants to, Clone Wars was around long before Disney got its mitts on the franchise and it was butchered by Disney just as much as the Expanded Universe was.\n\nAnd in a twist of irony it gives Filoni too much credit when the person who wrote all the Nightsisters episodes was Katie Lucas, daughter of George. It’s no different from what StarWars.com did to Wolverton. Besides, in a 2014 interview for the 20th anniversary of TCOPL, Wolverton had this to say:\n\nSo it appears Wolverton was happy to see his creation on The Clone Wars and was looking forward to seeing more onscreen depictions of Nightsisters. Maybe if Lucas were still in charge, we would’ve eventually seen more of the Singing Mountain Clan in upcoming shows, video games and action figures.\n\nWell, now that we got that out of the way, let’s take this hated, updated article and improve on it by rewriting it with EU and CW references. My “article” will mostly focus on standout moments and characters from the franchise. If you want a more detailed, in-depth article about the Nightsisters, head on over to Wookieepedia (and click on the Legends tab, if you so choose).\n\nStar Wars Inside Intel: The Nightsisters\n\nMeet the Witches of Dathomir\n\nby The Lady From Planet X\n\nMaking their first appearance in the 1994 Legends novel The Courtship of Princess Leia by the late Dave Wolverton, the Nightsisters were force sensitive magick practicing witches (yes, according to George, the Force and magic exist in the same universe, which is why the jedi are not “space wizards”) hailing from the planet Dathomir. In chapter 2, page 19, Luke Skywalker discovers an old holo vid of a young Master Yoda describing the failed rescue of “Chu’unthor from Dathomir”:\n\n“Artoo”, Luke said. “Run through your astrogation files and tell me if you find any reference to a place named Dathomir. It could be a star system, a single planet…” Maybe even a person, he thought with dismay.\n\nArtoo took a moment, then whistled a negative. “I thought not,” Luke said. I’ve never heard of it, either.” During the Clone Wars, so many planets had been destroyed, made uninhabitable. Perhaps Dathomir was one of those, a world so ravaged that it had been forgotten.\n\nConveniently, Luke’s question would be answered when a lovesick Han Solo wins Dathomir in a card game and kidnaps Leia to the mysterious planet. There, Han and Leia encounter the Singing Mountain Clan, a tribe of force-sensitive Amazons (who more than likely represent the Light Side of the Force) and their enemies, The Nightsisters, who are, in Han’s words, “their sith”.\n\n“The Nightsisters have come for General Solo and the other offworlders. We captured them first, and by all right they belong to us!”\n\n“If you want to interrogate General Solo, then perhaps I can help you. General Solo, why did you come to Dathomir?” Augwynne’s eyes flashed to the pouch at Han’s belt and he took the cue.\n\n“I own this planet and everything on it,” Han said. “I came to check out my real estate.”\n\nAs one of the Nightsisters began hissing, shaking their heads, and Baritha spat, “A man claims to own Dathomir?”\n\nHan fumbled in his pouch for the deed, found the box and pressed its switch. The holo of Dathomir appeared in the air above his palm, his name clearly registered as owner.\n\n“No!” Baritha shouted, waving her hand. The box flew from Han’s grip, tumbled to the floor.\n\n“That’s right,” Han said, I own this world, and I want you and your Nightsisters off my planet!”\n\nBaritha glared at him. “Gladly,” she said. “Provide us a ship, and we will leave.” – chapter 14, pg 179\n\nTrailing Han and Leia to the planet, Luke and Leia’s suitor, Prince Isolder, are also captured by the Singing Mountain Clan and – long story short (seriously, just read the book, it’s really good) – together they battle the Nightsisters.\n\nThis novel introduced the Nightsister character of Gethzerion, who would later make an appearance in Star Wars Galaxies.\n\nHowever, in the next year, all this would get retconned… sort of.\n\nIn 1995, Bantam Spectra, the same company that published TCOPL, published Kevin J. Anderson’s The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, a sort of textbook/travelogue “written” by historians and poets about the history and ecology of the planets of the Original Trilogy.\n\nAccording to this source book, the witch Charal (played by Sian Phillips) from the 1985 TV movie, Ewoks: The Battle For Endor was the first introduction of a Nightsister. In the book, an Imperial sergeant by the name of Pfilbee Jhorn writes:\n\n“Charal, is a female shape-shifter, a Force-wielding witch who apparently escaped from her exile on a planet called Dathomir.”\n\nNearly executed for stealing the Talisman of the Raven for its shapeshifting powers, Charal escaped from Dathomir and joined the Sanyassan Maurauders. She was made second-in-command to the warlord Terak and they ended up on Endor where they encountered Cindel Towani, Noa Briqualon and the Ewoks. In the end, she was turned into a raven permanently when Wicket destroyed the talisman.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Dave Filoni was considering including Charal in the show, but for some reason, it didn’t happen. However, she’s mentioned Daniel Wallace’s Book of Sith: Secrets From the Dark Side (2012).\n\nIn the same year, Anderson wrote another book where Luke would confront another Nightsister again, this time to rescue his niece and nephew. Young Jedi Knights: Shadow Academy introduced readers to Tamith Kai, a Nightsister who teamed up with a fallen jedi named Brakiss to “recruit” force sensitive youths into the Shadow Academy to be “trained” into Dark Jedi. Tamith Kai is hilariously defeated when the practical Tenel Ka, daughter of Prince Isolder, responds to Kai’s Force powers with a swift kick to the knee.\n\nBy now you’ve noticed that the Nightsisters are depicted as human looking with a pale complexion. All that would change in the late ’90s and early ’00s.\n\nThe “Sith Witch”\n\nDuring the making of The Phantom Menace, Lucas told concept artist Ian McCaig to design a person from “your worst nightmare”. One of the sketches would later become known as the “Sith Witch”, a woman dressed in red robes with a black and white type of “rorschach pattern” on her face.\n\nThis design was rejected by Lucas for the movie, but would later appear in The Dark Side Sourcebook of the 2001 Star Wars Roleplaying Game.\n\nAnother concept sketch that would be rejected and then recycled was Dermot Power’s “female apprentice to Count Dooku”.\n\nBut we’ll get to her in a minute.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, fans finally got to see the Nightsisters come to life in The Clone Wars season 3 episode titled, aptly, “Nightsisters”. It turns out that Asajj Ventress, who already made a name for herself in Dermot Power’s sketches, Clone Wars comics and books and Genndy Tartakovsky’s 2003 Clone Wars animated shorts, hailed from this eccentric coven – although her upbringing largely differed from her sisters.\n\nDathomir is depicted in The Clone Wars with sprawling rockscapes consisting of canyons, caves and cliffs (this is why when Prince Isolder saw Tenenial Djo nude for the first time, he noticed how muscular her back looked from lots of rock climbing). The flora and fauna aren’t too particularly friendly either. Fungus and fire lichen grow abundantly and native to the planet is the Rancor, used as mounts for the Nightsisters.\n\nThe Nightsisters’ magick was dark in nature, and Jedi that found themselves on their world often described feeling the presence of the dark side. Although their understanding of it was unique to their world and culture, the magick the sisters wielded was seemingly connected to the Force — just used in a vastly different way than the Jedi or the Sith. Where those groups followed strict dogmas and used the Force in (arguably) more simple ways such as pushing and pulling objects/beings or levitating, the Nightsisters used their magick to cast spells, perform rituals, and brew potions.\n\nWhen Asajj Ventress returned to her home world seeking guidance, her sisters bathed her in the glowing-green Water of Life in a ritual inducting her into their clan. Later, Mother Talzin, the leader of the clan, brewed a potion that allowed Asajj and a few of her sisters to become transparent — almost invisible — in order to perform a stealth mission.\n\nThe Nightsisters also used another form of their magick in rituals conducted following the death of one of their own. When a Nightsister passed, her clan took great care of the body, wrapping it in cloth soaked in the planet’s magickal waters and reciting a spell of protection for their fallen sister. They were then placed in a burial pod that would be hung from a Grave Thorn, a warped and twisted, barbed tree native to the planet.\n\nThough it appeared that the Witches of Dathomir ruled the planet, like most humanoid species, these women still needed males to reproduce. While The Singing Mountain Clan often captured men as mates, the Nightsisters had male counterparts in the form of the Nightbrothers, subservient to the witches. The two sects of natives lived and operated in separate areas of the planet, the Nightsisters calling on the brothers when needed. When Asajj’s original assassination plan failed with the use of the invisibility potion, Mother Talzin organized a competition amongst a selection of Nightbrothers. They fought in gladiatorial-style trials before one, Savage Opress, edged out the competition. He was then tasked to aid Asajj in her quest to exact revenge on her former teacher, Count Dooku. Whereas the Nightsisters wielded magick, the Nightbrothers were warriors. After Savage was selected to assist Asajj, Mother Talzin and the Nightsisters used their magicks to enhance Savage’s physical strength, putting him under a spell that forced him to obey their directions.\n\nMother Talzin was among the strongest witches in her clan, and served as their leader. She was a master at her arcane abilities, with the Nightsisters seeking her guidance. She was also responsible for handling any relations with the galaxy, such as when the malevolent Darth Sidious, an ally of Talzin’s, came to Dathomir and saw the potential in one of the young Nightbrothers. Talzin released the child to Sidious, who raised him as his Sith apprentice, and became known as Darth Maul (note: this happened in the James Luceno Legends novel, Darth Plagueis).\n\nAfter the many attempts Asajj made to have her former master, Count Dooku, executed to get revenge against him for abandoning her, Dooku turned his attention to the Nightsisters. With the Separatist army at his disposal, Dooku ordered General Grievous and his battle droids to the twisted planet of Dathomir to eradicate the galaxy of Nightsisters. But the Nightsisters would not go down without a fight.\n\nWith the guidance of Mother Talzin and the power of their dark magicks, the Nightsisters retaliated against the Separatist droids. Talzin went so far as to raise the dead, awakening deceased Nightsisters from their long slumber to aid the living in their attempt to avoid extinction. But despite their power and abilities, Talzin’s Nightsister clan met its demise. All but a few were slain, but their legacy carried on in those that remained.\n\nMy final entry here is Dark Disciple, a 2015 novel penned by Christie Golden, that was originally going to be an eight-part story arc on The Clone Wars before cancellation. After the massacre of her sisters and her betrayal by Count Dooku, Asajj spends the rest of her days as a bounty hunter. With the Jedi Order more determined than ever to have Dooku killed, they turn to his former apprentice for help by teaming her up with Jedi Master Quinlan Vos on a mission to assassinate the sith lord. You can guess how well that turns out. Long story short (seriously, read the book, its really good. Its arguably the only good novel from the new Star Wars canon), Ventress is killed in the process. Vos and Obi-Wan Kenobi (who now views Ventress as an ally) lay Asajj’s body in a dark pool at an abandoned Nightsister village on Dathomir. To the awe of the two jedi, the pool turns green at the touch of her body and the voices of the deceased Nightsisters are heard, welcoming Ventress back.\n\nSo there you have it. A herstory of the Nightsisters. What are your favorite memories of these creepy cool gals? Did you ever cosplay as a Nightsister? Do you own a Mother Talzin action figure? Let me know in the comments.\n\nFor Dave Wolverton (1957-2022), the Original Nightbrother."
