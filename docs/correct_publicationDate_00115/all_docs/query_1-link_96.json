        "text": "üêØüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ / ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ\n\nSeeking rich, powerful allies to bring into the Rebel Alliance, Princess Leia considers a proposal that could tip the balance of power against the evil Empire. The Hapes Consortium of 63 worlds is ruled by the Queen Mother, who wants Leia to marry her son, the dashing and wealthy Prince Isolder. Han always dreamed of marrying Leia himself, but he feels she sees him as nothing more than a shiftless rogue and Corellian pirate, unworthy of her hand. Now he makes a desperate last gamble to win her back‚Ä¶\n\nI was so, SO excited when I found this gorgeous vintage hardcover Star Wars romance tucked away in a second hand book store. It promised me fluffy Han x Leia romance. It promised me swashbuckling. BUT. Guys. It karking sUUUUCKKKS hairy rancor balls.\n\nIs this the worst characterisation of all time? (Spoiler: Yes)\n\nWhen I was nine, I wrote a Star Wars fanfiction in which Obi Wan was drunk on ginger beer for seven pages and Darth Vader tripped over his own lightsaber. With my hand on my heart, my story was more accurate than this novel. In fact, I would say that this novel is an insult to fanfiction writers everywhere! With the exception of C3PO*, none of the characters ring true, and it‚Äôs almost like Dave never watched the original trilogy before he sat down to write.\n\n*Shoutout to Threepio who decides that to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô Han by teaching him some romantic alien poetry to tell Leia, which then turns out to be HILARIOUSLY FOUL in translation. This was possibly the only excellent moment in the whole book.\n\nLuke is so boring I could cry. Why was he even in this book? He doesn‚Äôt do anything except have a useless side-quest to find some old Jedi data, which is completely unrelated to the main story. He also has no character development, and basically stands around taking up word count, getting under everyone‚Äôs feet, and spouting INCREDIBLY BLAND old man wisdom about Using The Force and Becoming One With The Force and The Dark Side Of The Force that NO-ONE WANTS TO FREAKING HEAR LUKE YOU‚ÄôRE BASICALLY 12.\n\nIn this book, the ‚Äòslightly sexist Harrison Ford model‚Äô of Han Solo is downgraded for ‚Äòraging misogynist Dave Wolverton model‚Äô.\n\nRemember the self-styled ‚Äòrogue‚Äô with the cool head, the arrogance, the stunted emotional development and staunch pretence of utter indifference to his own feelings? Yeah, forget about him. Here we have Incel Han: a mopey, moany suitor who drowns Leia in lovey dovey platitudes and unwanted ‚Äògifts‚Äô, is massively insecure in his own masculinity, and then turns to coercive control when Leia doesn‚Äôt do what he wants whilst simultaneously playing the victim. So a domestic abuser, actually.\n\nRemember Princess Leia, that woman full of wit, intelligence, and biting disdain for anyone who tries to put her down? Yeah, well screw her! In this novel we have Drunk Leia, a helpless pawn of the men around her whose decisions don‚Äôt make sense and dialogue sounds nothing like her in the movies. DAVE, WHY.\n\nRemember how much Leia loves Han? FUGGEDABOUDIT. All it takes is for Isolder, a topless, muscly prince with lucious blonde blonde locks and face modestly covered by a veil, to arrive on Coruscant and offer his hand in marriage‚Ä¶and she just ups and melts into his arms like Padme in Attack of the Clones, and says I love you in three chapters flat.\n\nThis book is from the Dark Side\n\nLike I said, He-Man Isolder only has to ripple his pecs at Drunk Leia, and she‚Äôs like LOL HAN BYE!\n\nSo, what does Incel Han do to win back the woman of his dreams??? Communicate with her about his feelings? Question why she‚Äôs so quick to throw out their relationship? Do something thoughtful and kind so she‚Äôll remember why she cares about him? LOL NO.\n\nHE SHOOTS HER WITH A BLASTER, KNOCKS HER UNCONCIOUS AND KIDNAPS HER OFF INTO DEEP SPACE.\n\nGOD WHAT EVEN WERE THE FUCKING 80S. DAVE WHAT THE FUCK. FUCK THIS SHIT\n\nAt this stage of the book I flew into an apoplectic rage, and as a result I was struggling to make sense the actual words on the page. There‚Äôs no way I can properly review them, so I present some of the Worst Moments to you here for you to see for yourself.\n\nSome Excerpts\n\nAH YES. THIS IS WHAT TRUE LOVE LOOKS LIKE: ENTITLEMENT FOLLOWING REJECTION, DOMESTIC ASSAULT, AND THEN KIDNAP\n\nhe put everything on the line for her‚Ä¶. BY KIDNAPPING HER???? THIS IS NOT A THING. THIS IS NOT LOVE\n\nHE LITERALLY SHOT HER AND KIDNAPPED HER BUT SHE IS THE UNREASONABLE ONE??? HE WANTS BOYFRIEND POINTS FOR GIVING HER COOKED MEALS WHILST SHE IS HIS HOSTAGE???? WHAT THE MERRY FUCK\n\npresented without comment.\n\nWhere is the courtship????\n\nAfter the kidnapping session and it‚Äôs immediate aftermath, the entire romance plot and the entire love triangle just‚Ä¶.fades away.\n\nUm excuse me?? This book is literally called ‚ÄòThe COURTSHIP of Princess Leia‚Äô so I am expecting LOTS OF COURTSHIP thank you???\n\n‚ÄúLol hahahahaha Maddy you think there‚Äôs going to be COURTSHIP you‚Äôre kidding yourself why would you expect romance‚Ä¶in a romance book??‚Äù\n\nSeriously, there is no romance in this book (after the terrible start, which I don‚Äôt count, because it was terrible). Han, Leia, Isolder and Luke all just get dumped on a mysterious planet called Dathomir, where they ride around on the backs of some rancors, and get chased by imperial walkers for three hundred pages.\n\nSO WHY IS THIS BLURBED AS A ROMANCE AND WHAT WAS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE KIDNAP????!\n\nWhy is this book drunk\n\nDathomir is run by a society of matriarchal, force wielding witches, who are actually kind of cool. They meet a warrior witch called Teneniel. Turns out that a group of exiled evil witches is in cahoots with the Empire (of course), so Teneniel and the gang team up with the other good witches to defeat her, fix the Falcoln and get off the planet before the Empire blows them all to smithereens.\n\nThe good witches all seem to be hot AF and ride about in tunics of lizard hide with feathers and beads in their hair and carrying spears. Teneniel has flowing auburn hair and amber eyes. The BAD witches are ugly, wizened crones in hooded black cloaks. Everyone lives inside castles and speaks in whenceforths and forsooths. God, it‚Äôs so 80s that it hurts (and it was written in the 90s which honestly just hurts more).\n\nHowever (PLOT TWIST) in this society men are nameless, puny weaklings, who have no social and political power, don‚Äôt get trained to fight, and don‚Äôt have ANY SPEAKING ROLES IN THE BOOK AT ALL. This oddly meant that the book became brilliant in terms of gender representation??\n\nBUT oh by the way, the witches capture men as slaves to be their husbands.\n\nLuke is lassoed by Teneniel who is then like ‚Äòwe must mate now‚Äô. Then Isolder and Luke get sexually harassed by these ladies for the next 100 pages. NOPE. Was matriarchal slavery supposed to cancel out the misogyny in the first half of the book or something?? What even is going on anymore??!!! AND THEN at the end the characters shake hands all like ‚ÄòHo ho ho, aren‚Äôt mating rituals on our two different planets amusingly quaint and different, we have toxic masculinity and you have sex slavery, but it‚Äôs all jolly good fun and we can agree we‚Äôre all equally fine!!‚Äô\n\nDAVE‚Ä¶UM, NO????? SO MUCH NO I DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO EXPLAIN TO YOU\n\nWhat even is this book I can‚Äôt\n\nThe plot actually became half decent apart from the terrible characters, although I suppose even the naffest plot of all time would have looked like literary genius following the kidnapping incident. After a lot of pissing about in a jungle with some rancors, and about seven chase scenes involving rancors and imperial walkers, the evil witches of Dathomir are inevitably defeated at the last minute by the force or something. I don‚Äôt even remember.\n\nFor the entire book, Teneniel was busy sulking because Luke didn‚Äôt want to marry her despite her sexy lasso kidnapping, and Isolder was busy planning his wedding to Leia. But then in the last chapter after a single conversation together ‚Ä¶ Isolder and Teneniel randomly decide that they are SOULMATES, and Isolder is like ‚ÄòI was never really into Leia anyway she‚Äôs not my type‚Äô.\n\nWHAT????!!!!! I give up.\n\nIt would be fair to give the overall plot of this book three stars, minus a star for bad execution. But I CANNOT overlook how naff this is to the amazingness of Star Wars. And I can‚Äôt forgive a pointless misogyny, a pointless love triangle, and terrible characterisation. Look, writing fanfiction isn‚Äôt hard, Dave. The characters and their voices have already been created for you!!! All you have to do is stay true to them!!! If you can‚Äôt manage that as a ‚Äòreal‚Äô ‚Äòpublished‚Äô authour, well then, your writing sucks. If this was original fiction maybe I‚Äôd give it two stars, but it ain‚Äôt, so you don‚Äôt get kudos for having done the groundwork. ONE paper tiger out of five!\n\nSorry Dave, but the extended universe is rolling in its grave.\n\nChat with Me!\n\nCan someone please explain to me what the heck did I just read? Has anyone else read this? Was this considered good official fanfiction in the 90s? If so, how? And where can I get some ACTUAL HAN AND LEIA ROMANCE FICTION????"
