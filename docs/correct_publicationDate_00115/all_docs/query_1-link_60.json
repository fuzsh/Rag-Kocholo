        "text": "How do you review something that you know is terrible but that you liked anyways?\n\nThe Courtship of Princess Leia is not the best Star Wars Expanded Universe novel. It’s more than a little sexist, everyone acts out of character at some point, and the first third is pretty contrived. But goddamn is it fun. The new characters sparkle, and the old ones we all know and love have awesome moments to counterbalance the out of character stuff.\n\nThe characterization of Han Solo best illustrates my point. He starts the book by knocking Leia out, then kidnapping her so he can woo her and convince her to marry him. Great. I talked to a friend about this and we agreed that such behavior was out of character. Sure, Han would probably trick her to go on vacation, but kidnapping isn’t something he would do. But still I can’t be mad at the book for this. Towards the end of the book, Han gets all heroic and prepares sacrifices himself to save everyone (fortunately, Luke’s awesome piloting skills gets Han out of that jam) and says he knows Leia loves him and always will and oh, there go the feels…\n\nThe action and fight scenes kept me engaged. I was the edge of my seat, even though I knew everyone would come out alright. The villains do not care if the heroes live or die, and that raised the stakes considerably. They won’t spare Han and Leia to set up a trap to bait Luke. Unlike Vader, none of the villains think Luke is special enough to keep alive and don’t bother to test or toy with him.\n\nThe main villains are a group of Dark Side users called the Nightsisters. They and their lightside counterparts are by far the best part of the novel. They are awesome. They kick ass and use the Force in ways you don’t see in the original trilogy. They kick up windstorms, tame rancor beasts and one even gives another character a stroke by squeezing the blood vessels in their brain. I’m glad they’re still an official part of the Star Wars canon by way of The Clone Wars cartoon.\n\nPerhaps I was able to accept the book’s flaws because it is no longer part of Star Wars official canon. Sure, future authors can take it as canon and use it in new Expanded Universe works. But they aren’t obligated to. I can take the Witches, I can take the book’s applications of the Force, but I can leave behind Han’s shitty behavior. The canon of what did and didn’t happen falls under my control in the context of this book. I can trim away the rotten parts and leave behind a stronger, more feminist canon for one of my favorite franchises."
