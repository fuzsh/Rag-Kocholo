        "text": "Yesterday, while preparing to post the previous entry in this series, it occurred to me that for all the work I put into these book reviews (both here and over on The Time Lord Archives), I’m essentially just writing book reports. It’s junior high school all over again! And that’s a bit deflating to consider, until a friend reframed it for me–that a skill picked up in school continues to bring me pleasure today. Which, I think, is a much more charitable–and more valid–way to look at it. After all, though I appreciate every reader and follower, I really do this for myself, as an expression of the pleasure I’ve gotten out of books over the years.\n\nThat sentiment rings doubly true with me today, because, unlike yesterday’s novel, today’s novel launched while I was still in junior high (if only barely; I finished junior high two months later). Released April 1, 1994, that novel is The Courtship of Princess Leia by Dave Wolverton, and was it ever a nostalgia trip for me! To explain: The last seven books we’ve covered are the first seven books in the X-Wing series by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston–none of which I read at the time of release (1996-1999). Aside from not being particularly interested at the time in what felt like an offshoot of the main series of Star Wars novels, I also couldn’t afford them; I did my reading via the library, and they didn’t have the X-Wing novels. So, for those books, as with Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor, this project wasn’t a reread; it was the initial read. Not so with The Courtship of Princess Leia! I’m not certain that I read it immediately upon release, but it had to have been within the first year; I do know I had not read very much else in the Expanded Universe at that time, possibly only the Thrawn Trilogy (which we have yet to cover). So, for me, this was early days indeed.\n\nThat sentiment is true for the novel itself, as well. Only five of the new era of EU novels precede its publication: The Thrawn Trilogy, The Truce at Bakura, and Jedi Search. (To clarify: This is not including the young readers books, such as The Glove of Darth Vader, of which there were an equal number at that time. While the canonicity of those books can be debated, they have little influence on continuity, and we aren’t considering them here.) Fans of the later EU are going to find this novel to be a bit rough around the edges.\n\nSo, let’s dive in! As usual, there are spoilers ahead, although I should say that the major points of this novel have been well known among EU fans for a long time.\n\nThe events of this novel pick up shortly after the events of Solo Command, and flow immediately from those events. Han Solo returns to Coruscant after the apparent destruction of Zsinj’s flagship, looking for rest and expecting to reunite with Leia Organa–only to walk in on a most distressing event. Leia has been seeking a treaty with the reclusive Hapes Consortium, a monarchy covering at least 63 worlds, which possesses a large battle fleet and a fabulous amount of wealth, both of which the New Republic needs if it is to continue to deal with the remnants of the Empire. However, coming as a surprise to both Leia and Han, the treaty is contingent on a marriage proposal for Leia from the Hapan crown prince, Isolder! Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker is searching for records of the pre-Empire Jedi; his search leads him to mention of an obscure planet called Dathomir.\n\nHan and Isolder quickly devolve into a hostile rivalry for Leia’s affections, in which Han is undercut by the efforts of the many diplomats who want to see the marriage take place. Desperate to impress Leia, Han gets into, and wins, a high-stakes card game, which nets him ownership of a planet. He plans to present it to Leia as a prospective home for the displaced Alderaanian people…only to find out it is deep within Warlord Zsinj’s territory. The name of the planet? Dathomir. Seeing time tick away, Han kidnaps Leia and takes her to the planet, but is shot down in orbit, and discovers the planet was interdicted by the Empire (that is, no landings or launches were permitted, cutting the planet off from all transportation). Isolder follows him there, and with assistance from Luke, arrives only minutes after Han and Leia–and, along with Luke, is promptly shot down as well. Luke saves Isolder’s life via the Force, and Isolder, his worldview shaken by this act, becomes a student of the Jedi way (although he lacks force sensitivity). Luke discovers a centuries-old Jedi ship crashed on the planet, a mobile training academy called the Chu’unthor; shortly after, he and Isolder are captured by a Force-powerful woman named Teneniel Djo. Soon reunited, our heroes–Han, Leia, Luke, Isolder, C-3PO and R2-D2–find themselves caught in an impending war between Teneniel’s tribe of Force-sensitive “witches” and their evil counterparts, the Nightsisters. The Nightsisters are seeking a way off the planet to spread their dominion; and they have just become aware of the Millennium Falcon, which is damaged but repairable.\n\nHeavy spoilers here: In the end, several things are accomplished. The Nightsisters are defeated; Han trades ownership of the planet to the tribe; the Falcon is repaired; Zsinj is at long last killed by Han, and his ship, the Iron Fist, is destroyed; Luke obtains the extensive records from the Chu’unthor; Isolder weds Teneniel Djo and commits Hapes to joining the Republic; and, oh yeah, Han and Leia get married. It’s a strong transition to the next phase of the EU, and a lot of ground is covered!\n\nSo, what of those points? Let’s look at a few, and I’ll give you my thoughts.\n\nThe Nightsisters and Dathomir: When I first read this book, this was the only mention of Dathomir in existence. At the time, it seemed like just another interesting planet: Fascinating, sure, but probably just a one-off location, much like Mimban in 1978’s Splinter of the Mind’s Eye. Little did I know back then that Star Wars is guilty of that one utterly insane flaw that plagues franchise fiction: Never being able to let something go! This is a more egregious problem in Star Wars than in some other franchises, because of the sheer size of its universe, and it happens all the time. Rightly speaking, a backwater world like, say, Tatooine should not be as pivotal or as frequently seen as it is; but it shows up constantly, and everyone who’s anybody has been there. (“Well, if there’s a bright center of the universe, you’re on the planet it’s farthest from.” ~Luke Skywalker, A New Hope) Something similar happens to Dathomir, both in the EU and in current canon, where this planet that was so unknown that none of our heroes had heard of it or could look it up, takes on a much greater significance. Now, to be fair, it’s understandable for it to become significant in the future from this point; Teneniel Djo becomes the Queen Mother of Hapes, and her daughter becomes both Queen Mother and a significant Jedi. But the planet becomes significant for other, much less justifiable reasons, both in the future and the past. Likewise, the Nightsisters prove just too irresistible for later writers, especially in canon; they become a surrogate family for Darth Maul, and their history becomes quite muddled as compared to the simplicity found in this novel. It may be inevitable, but I find it disappointing; I much prefer the pristine, backwater Dathomir we see here, and the powerful but also pitiable Nightsisters we see.\n\nThe Chu’unthor: In 1994, this was the most striking part of the book to me, and yet it’s largely downplayed. These days, I understand the line the authors had to walk; the overall story of the EU could advance, and there seemed to be a plan for that, but no one could advance it too quickly. Thus, a discovery such as the Chu’unthor and its records should have been earthshattering–a real and powerful boon for the nascent Jedi order–but they are rarely mentioned again after this, as I recall. This is one instance where further expansion would absolutely be merited; and indeed it does get some elaboration on its lore, but mostly via supporting materials such as sourcebooks. What a pity; this was a great start, but it fizzles out later.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that we’re seeing the early stages of something that is quite prominent in upcoming years. Luke’s attempts to restart the Jedi order really get started here, though there are nods to it in earlier stories (and of course some later stories had already been written–when I say it starts here, I mean in-universe). Remember that this all occurs before the prequel trilogy was produced. Things look very different from their final forms; for example, Luke concludes here that the Jedi never had a planet-bound training center at all, and instead had the Chu’unthor as a mobile academy. Obviously the Jedi Temple on Coruscant wasn’t a thing yet–it would be five more years before The Phantom Menace established it. Fortunately, the EU proved to be flexible enough to incorporate those changes when they came about. Chiefly it did this by making the Empire very effective indeed, especially in terms of expunging the memory of the Jedi; we’ve already touched on this a bit with the X-Wing series and the Jedi museum on Coruscant, which the Emperor had packed away. Still, throughout the EU’s lifespan, there’s always going to be some tension between the prequels’ portrayal of the Jedi–stiff, regimented, regulated, centralized–and the wild variety that springs up in the early days of the EU (which we’ll see when older Jedi are proven to have survived the Emperor’s purge).\n\nIsolder and Teneniel Djo: Theirs is a great, if abrupt, romance. It’s almost too abrupt–one could get whiplash at how fast the affections of these two change–but in context that makes sense. Both characters are highly motivated people of action, prone to making quick but impactful decisions; Teneniel Djo even tells Isolder directly that women in her society often choose their husbands very quickly, with little time for forethought. I’m quite happy for them; but I have always thought of their marriage as a stepping stone for the purposes of the EU, as it’s going to get fairly little discussion later in favor of their prominent daughter, Tenel Ka. As for their kingdom (er, queendom? It’s decidedly matriarchal), Hapes, the level of intrigue and barely-veiled violence described leads me to only one conclusion: Game of Thrones in space! If ever there’s a spinoff in need of being written, it’s that one.\n\nZsinj and the Iron Fist: Here is the true payoff of the novel, and I would strongly suggest that Wolverton had no idea when he wrote it–rather, it’s mostly creditable to the work of Aaron Allston in Solo Command. That novel and this, I believe, are best read in quick sequence, as they function as an unofficial duology. Courtship was written in media res with regard to the war against Zsinj, which is in hindsight impressive to me. Wolverton gives us the end of the war, and hints at what has gone before, in a way that very much suggests that this is a sequel. The problem? It isn’t. In fact it was written five years before the book that would detail the events that Courtship establishes. And so, Allston completes the cycle. Wolverton tells us about some of the systems to which Han had chased Zsinj; Allston shows it to us. Wolverton describes the planetary Nightcloak (an invisibility cloak of sorts around the planet Dathomir); Allston shows us the prototype that saves the Iron Fist from destruction. The two books are so tightly woven that the only significant error I found is that Courtship implies that Iron Fist is a lesser class of Star Destroyer, rather than a Super Star Destroyer. It’s really marvelous how well the two books coordinate.\n\nHan and Leia: Here we come to the purpose of the book. Timothy Zahn had already established in the Thrawn Trilogy that Han and Leia were married at some point; and as it’s unthinkable that such a prominent event for two of the “big three” characters would go undocumented, here we are! It’s a chapter that needed to be told. Ironically, the wedding itself only gets just a brief and cursory description, totaling about a page (I think; I did my reread in ebook form, so the page length varies), all told from Luke’s perspective as a late-arriving guest. Well, I suppose the title is “The Courtship of Princess Leia”, not “The Wedding of Princess Leia”. And yet, this simple scene is going to lay the foundation for two decades of stories to follow; Han and Leia’s marriage is one of the cornerstones of the post-RotJ EU, and no one would dare to suggest it’s anything less than rock solid (looking at you, The Force Awakens). Well, okay, maybe not exactly that. But this is a historic moment! Fun trivia: It’s not the only take on their wedding! The young readers Jedi Prince series–which we aren’t covering here–touched on the marriage of Han and Leia, four in-universe years earlier, in its final installment, Prophets of the Dark Side. That book featured Leia planning her wedding, and seeing a vision of Han and two children (ostensibly their twins Jacen and Jaina, already established in the Thrawn Trilogy). The plan was for the wedding to be interrupted, then addressed in the next and final book, which was never released. (Credit to Redditor /u/QualityAutism for this trivia.)\n\nBefore we go, here’s a hint of what is to come: There’s a minor, comedic plot thread here in which C-3PO, eager to help Han win Leia back from Isolder, digs into Han’s past and discovers that Han is the descendant of a king of Corellia, and thus hereditary king himself. Threepio goes on to call him “King Solo” throughout the book, before discovering on the day of the wedding that Han’s ancestor was a usurper and false king who was rightly deposed–much to Threepio’s horror and Luke’s humor. (Luke locks him in a closet to keep him from interrupting the wedding with this news.) It’s just a bit of silliness, but it presages the rather major topic of Han’s actual lineage, which we’re going to dig into in depth in the Han Solo Trilogy and the Corellian Trilogy–but that’s all a long way off.\n\nOpinions have swayed over the years regarding The Courtship of Princess Leia. These days it gets a bit of flak, and doesn’t often make it onto fans’ “essential books” lists. Perhaps there’s justification for that. The story is choppy; things happen fast, without much setup. The characterization is uneven; Han, who has just come off being a decorated Republic general, gets drunk and says and does things that seem jarring coming from him. Some of that can be attributed to love making people both desperate and crazy, but it’s a little over the top (he literally shoots Leia with what amounts to a date rape gun, then kidnaps her). It’s probably not a story that would play out the same if written today–but it needed to be written. I personally consider it essential, not for its intrinsic qualities, but because it details such an iconic moment in our heroes’ lives. We need this story for what lies ahead.\n\nSo, that’s it! We’re over the hurdle of Han and Leia’s wedding, and all is smooth sailing ahead! No, of course not. After all, what’s a wedding without a honeymoon? And that’s what we’ll cover next time, in Troy Denning’s novel, Tatooine Ghost (accompanied by the short story, Corphelion Interlude). See you there!\n\nThe Courtship of Princess Leia is available from Amazon and other booksellers.\n\nYou can find Wookieepedia’s treatment of the novel here.\n\nPrevious"
