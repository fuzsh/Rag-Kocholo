        "text": "Courtship Review\n\nAbove Average:\n\nWritten very well, encompases humor and action with a well thought through plot. Need to read/listen to this book in order to understand future Star Wars novels. A very small percentage of the book actually pertains to courting Leai.\n\nPoor Abridgement\n\nFor the book being called the Courtship of Princess Leia, it was pretty sad how little it had to do with the romance of Han & Leia. The condensed version was also very confusing & hard to follow. I hope they release a full version of it, perhaps with a woman narrator, instead. Probably better to start with the actual book.\n\nNot Your Typical Romance... Come on It's Star Wars\n\nFor those of you who saw the credits roll for Return of the Jedi and thought, \"BUT are Han and Leia are going to get married?\" well, this is the book for you. This isn't your typical Romance, largely because its Star Wars. But it is a blast. Those seeking romance and those seeking action can both be pleased here (perhaps akin to a Gerard Butler RomCom).\n\nBut let's talk about the true draw to this book (in my opinion). This is no longer canon, for those concerned, but this story had much to do with influencing current canon. The Nightsisters of Dathomir had a long run on The Clone Wars and Rebels, and this is where that all started. And they are the reason I keep coming back to this book. A primitive society of ladies who use the force and ride rancors. What more could you ask for?\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the abridged story. It's a nice length, but I've read the book and I wish I could've heard the whole thing. For those unfamiliar with this story, I think it will feel completed and conclusive.\n\nStory Quality: One can find much to enjoy here. Admitedly, it can be cheesy at points, and yet much of the novelty and fun makes up for it.\n\nAudio Quality.: Fantastic. You couldn't ask for better."
