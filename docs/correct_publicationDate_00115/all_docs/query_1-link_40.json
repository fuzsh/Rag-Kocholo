        "text": "Excellent\n\nVery entertaining. Star Wars was so much fun before the Disney mean girls took over.\n\nRefreshingly great!!\n\nJanuary LaVoy’s best performance yet!! It also helps that the story was written during a time where they cared more about the quality of both the individual story as well as the over arching story of the star wars universe. Unlike the hot mess of garbage that is the majority of the new cannon material, they built the star wars universe from the inside out letting political struggles, ethical issues, etc. form naturally without compromising the star wars story. To many of the new stories try to force the star wars story around the current political “hot topics”. If I want to be reminded of all of the political divisions and stresses we are going through currently there are plenty of other books I can read. When I read/listen to a star wars book I want to be transported to a galaxy far far away. Which in my opinion is one of the key aspects of a good star ways story. That is why I am so glad they are coming out with the EU books as unabridged and narrated by incredible talent such as January LaVoy and Marc Thompson. Keep it up!!!\n\nFantastic!\n\nI’d been stuck with the three-hour abridged version for years, so I was very excited to have this unabridged version. This is my favorite Star Wars book. The story is excellent, and the narration was very well done. I will be listening to this again in the future!\n\nLong lost love of a story\n\nI read this book in 1995. I’ve been waiting for it for a very, very long time on audio. I love the story, but the one thing I do not like is that they make Han a putz in this book. Han, not Dr Jones would act that way towards a woman who blew him off to immediately go jump ship to another guy. That’s just my opinion.\n\nC-3PO should never be voiced by a woman. I don’t mean that derogatory, it just was terrible.\n\nThe story is great, I love the characters and I might have a little thing for Teneniel Djo. They truly make her a character you want to know more about\n\nThe story has always been a favorite. Luke really shows his skills in this book.\n\nAll around, and I hate saying this, because I like the narrator…. Sometimes you need a male/female narrator to make it 5 star. The gal is great, but C-3PO is annoying enough with out it being feminine in nature\n\nHan should never be precived as a begger. That didn’t work.\n\nAnyway, definitely worth a read. 28 years I’ve waited for this story in audio format\n\nA REALLY strange but surprisingly entertaining romp\n\nI ended up enjoying this book way more than I thought. I always heard that this book was kinda dumb for the relationship drama and it's weird that it led into a much more action packed plot, but the drama was well written enough and it's interesting to see the origins of the Night sisters and Dathomir from the clone wars show. I liked it :3"
