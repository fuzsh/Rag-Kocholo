        "text": "Seeking rich, powerful allies to bring into theRebel Alliance and a new home planet for therefugees of her native Alderaan, Princess Leiaconsiders a proposal that could tip the balance of poweragainst the evil Empire. The Hapes Consortium of63 worlds is ruled by the Queen Mother, who wantsLeia to marry her son, the dashing and wealthyPrince Isolder. Han Solo has always dreamed ofmarrying Leia himself, and now he makes a desperatelast gamble to win her back. Soon he, Isolder,Luke Skywalker and Artoo will be at the center of anadventure leading to an awesome treasure, a groupof Force-trained \"witches,\" and ashowdown with an invincible foe.\n\nDave Wolverton—aka, David Farland—was an award-winning, New York Times bestselling author with nearly fifty science fiction and fantasy novels to his credit, written for both adults and young adults. He won the Writers of the Future International Gold Award for best short story of the year, the Philip K. Dick Memorial Special Award for Best Novel in the English Language, the Whitney Award for Best Novel of the Year, and many other awards. His novels have been translated into more than twenty languages, and his readership runs into the millions. Over the years he worked with some of the largest franchises in the world—writing novels for Star Wars and The Mummy, and designing and scripting international bestselling videogames for StarCraft and Xena.\n\nGeorge Lucas brought us the blockbuster Star WarsR film trilogy. Then some of science fiction's best writersR expanded the adventure in their bestselling Star Wars novels. Now the tradition continues with the culmination of a love story that spans a war-torn galaxy.... Though Darth Vader and the Emperor are dead, the Empire lives on and a weakened Alliance must find powerful new help if it is to survive. The answer could lie in the Hapes consortium, a cluster of sixty-three high-tech worlds. There is only one catch: Princess Leia must marry the Queen Mother's son, the dashing and wealthy Prince Isolder. Han Solo reacts badly to the news. Tricking Leia, he flees with her to the beautiful but untamed planet of Dathomir, where he hopes to change her mind-and win her heart. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker and Artoo form an unlikely partnership with the jilted prince to track down the runaways. But their mission is only the beginning of an adventure that will lead to the discovery of an awesome treasure, a group of Force-trained \"witches,\" and a showdown with an invincible foe."
