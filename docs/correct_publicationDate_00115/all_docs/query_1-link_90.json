        "meta_description": "Before the marriage of Princess Leia Organa and Han Solo, another suitor threatened to derail their star-crossed romance. . . . Seeking rich, powerful allies to bring into the Rebel Alliance and a new home planet for the refugees from her native Alderaan, Princess Leia considers a proposal that could tip the balance of power against the evil Empire. The Hapes Consortium of 63 worlds is ruled by the Queen Mother, who wants Leia to marry her son, the dashing and wealthy Prince Isolder. Han Solo has always dreamed of marrying Leia himself, and now he makes a desperate, final gamble to win her back. Tricking Leia into accompanying him, Han flees with her to the beautiful and untamed planet Dathomir, where he hopes to win her heart. Fearing the imperious queen's reaction to Han's rash move, Luke Skywalker forms an unlikely alliance with Prince Isolder to track down the runaways. Soon Isolder, Luke, and Artoo will be at the center of an adventure leading to an awesome treasure, a group of Force-trained \"witches,\" and a showdown with an invincible foe.Binding Type: PaperbackAuthor: Dave WolvertonPublisher: Random House WorldsPublished: 10/24/2023ISBN: 9780593722190Pages: 384",
