        "text": "The Emperor may have been defeated at Endor, but of course there were still plenty of warlords out there trying to take a piece of territory for themselves. One of these, Warlord Zsinj, has had the New Republic on the run for years, but finally, it seems that General Han Solo has defeated him, and he returns home to Coruscant to find a fleet of starships of unfamiliar design around the capital world. The Hapes Cluster has opened its borders to the New Republic, and the crown prince of the 63 worlds, Prince Isolder, has come to ask for Leia’s hand in marriage, to cement the new alliance. In a fit of jealousy, Han enters a sabacc game and wins a planet, whereupon he abducts Leia and takes her there, with Chewie and Threepio in tow. The planet is Dathomir, and he hopes that seven days on his new world will convince Leia that she still loves Han, and will consent to marry him.\n\nIsolder isn’t too happy, though, and along with Luke, travels to Dathomir to find them. Instead, they find the world under Imperial interdiction by the forces of Zsinj. Han crash-lands the Falcon and they soon discover the planet is ruled by the Witches of Dathomir, some of whom have some degree of Force sensitivity. Luke and Isolder are taken captive by one, Teneniel Djo, who takes them to her grandmother of the Singing Mountain Clan, which is conveniently where Han and Leia are also staying. It soon transpires that there is a faction of dark side users, the Nightsisters, under the leadership of Gethzerion, who are at war with the witches. The reason for the Imperial interdict is to keep Gethzerion and her group on-planet, as even Emperor Palpatine feared the Nightsisters freely roaming the galaxy.\n\nHan and co infiltrate an Imperial prison that is the Nightsisters’ base to get the parts they need to repair the Falcon, but as soon as she realises what is going on, and her way off-planet might be secured, Gethzerion launches her attack. The heroes of the New Republic are able to defeat the Nightsisters, and Han and Leia get married on Coruscant, while Isolder finds himself in love with his erstwhile captor, Teneniel Djo, and so he takes her back to Hapes with him as his wife.\n\nOh my, this book hasn’t aged very well. Let’s try to get the bad stuff out of the way first. Han is really out of character in this book, and so is Leia as it happens. The book is set 3-4 years after Return of the Jedi, and they seem to be in some kind of casual relationship, probably due to the fact that Han is off being a general, and Leia is off being a diplomat. Nevertheless, they are still in a relationship, yet Leia seems to be quite happy to just dump Han and move on to Isolder because he is a beautiful man. That’s it. True, he brings a massive amount of wealth that will help the New Republic in their fight against warlord of the week Zsinj, but it seems extremely out of character for her. Han, for his part, abducts her and then starts having second thoughts, but to my mind it doesn’t seem like it’s enough. The book came out in 1995, I think, so #metoo wasn’t a thing, but the whole thing is presented like it’s some kind of hijinks that we should just go along with, not think about just how creepy it makes Han, who was ready to let go of Leia when he thought she loved Luke instead.\n\nLuke has a bit of an interesting storyline, in that he starts on the planet Toola, the home of the Whiphid people, hunting for Jedi artifacts. He finds mention of Yoda and the planet Dathomir, and so when he learns where Han has taken Leia, we have a Moment, and he’s off there. Conveniently, he is able to find pretty much what he needs within the space of about an hour on-world, perhaps that’s another Moment. He starts to train Isolder in the Force, for some reason, though this is before midichlorians, when it did seem like anybody could train to be a Jedi. Maybe Isolder has some latent ability, it’s never really touched upon properly.\n\nConvenience after convenience, the plot unfolds without much to worry about. There are some silly things from the Imperials, such as the Orbital Nightcloak – a linked series of satellites that can block a planet from the sun, and render it an inhospitable wasteland in 7 days (or your money back?) but which is wired in series like an old string of Christmas lights, and so a few well-placed shots can bring down the whole thing with ease. There’s also the ongoing silliness about Han being the King of Corellia, and Threepio aiding and abetting him in his pursuit of Leia. Although that goes from silly to annoying really fast.\n\nHowever, there are some cool bits. The witches ride on rancors, so we learn that Dathomir is their homeworld, and the one in Jabba’s pit was clearly a runt. They seem to be vaguely intelligent, as we have one beast actively teaching stuff to her young. The idea of a floating Jedi academy does go against the lore of the Jedi temple of the prequels of course, but is also completely sensible if you think about it. A flying academy, going where it needs to go, is definitely an idea that I can get behind. There’s also a very cool scene where Luke single-handedly flies the Falcon with the use of the Force, and goes in with all guns blazing to save the day – for years, that has been my overriding memory of this book, as Luke being a powerful Jedi is always very impressive!\n\nFor all of the bad stuff, The Courtship of Princess Leia is one of those curious books in the old expanded universe where later authors mined it almost incessantly. Prince Isolder, his mother Ta’a Chume, the Hapes Cluster – all of these things have a big impact in the New Jedi Order, where Hapes is seen as a refuge from the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Nothing has had quite the same impact as the witches of Dathomir, though, who were ported over into the Clone Wars cartoon series and made into something that almost goes against what we see here, but their influence has been felt for years since. Mother Talzin, Savage Oppress, Asajj Ventress – even Darth Maul himself are all now from Dathomir. The witches in both continuities seem to be almost druidic in how they draw their power, however the Nightsisters seem to be the main focus of the Clone Wars, whereas they are only a small percentage of the total clans on Dathomir in this book.\n\nIt has always amazed me, in that respect, how much influence this book has been able to have over later Star Wars, even getting into new canon, while itself being a fairly mediocre entry. There’s a lot of 90s embarrassing power-fantasy stuff going on, the tone for Leia and Han especially, and even Threepio at times, all drag this one down, however, so that it ends up scraping around the 2 stars level. Which is a shame, as for years I’ve not thought of this as being as bad as it is!"
