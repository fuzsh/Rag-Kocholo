The Courtship of Princess Leia Sourcebook was a proposed West End Games sourcebook covering the events of the novel The Courtship of Princess Leia. Matt Hong was the chosen author, working on the manuscript for about four months, with support from the novel's author Dave Wolverton. However, the book was never published under this title, instead forming part of the later work, Cracken's Threat Dossier. Hong wrote a letter to Star Wars Insider magazine with an anecdote about his writer's block while working on the manuscript. This letter was published in Rebel Rumblings, part of Star Wars Insider 27.[1]
