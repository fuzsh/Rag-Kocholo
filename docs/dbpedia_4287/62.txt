Synopsis:

Thersites rails against Achilles and Ajax, and then, joined by Achilles and Patroclus, ridicules them to their faces. As Agamemnon and his councillors approach, Achilles goes inside his tent and refuses to meet them. The Greek leaders then heap praise on Ajax to prepare him to take up Hector’s challenge.

Enter Thersites, alone.

⌜THERSITES⌝ 1210 How now, Thersites? What, lost in the

1211 labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry

1212 it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O, worthy

1213 satisfaction! Would it were otherwise, that I could

1214 5 beat him whilst he railed at me. ’Sfoot, I’ll learn to

1215 conjure and raise devils but I’ll see some issue of

1216 my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a

1217 rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine

1218 it, the walls will stand till they fall of

1219 10 themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,

1220 forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods;

1221 and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy

1222 caduceus, if you take not that little, little, less than

1223 little wit from them that they have, which short-armed

1224 15 ignorance itself knows is so abundant

1225 scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly

1226 from a spider without drawing their massy irons

1227 and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on

1228 the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache!

1229 20 For that, methinks, is the curse depending

1230 on those that war for a placket. I have said my

1231 prayers, and devil Envy say “Amen.”—What ho,

1232 my lord Achilles!

PATROCLUS, ⌜within⌝ 1233 Who’s there? Thersites? Good

1234 25 Thersites, come in and rail.

THERSITES 1235 If I could ’a remembered a gilt counterfeit,

1236 thou couldst not have slipped out of my contemplation.

1237 But it is no matter. Thyself upon thyself! The

1238 common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance,

1239 30 be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from

1240 a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy

1241 blood be thy direction till thy death; then if she

1242 that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I’ll be

p. 93

1243 sworn and sworn upon ’t she never shrouded any

1244 35 but lazars. Amen.

⟨Enter Patroclus.⟩

1245 Where’s Achilles?

PATROCLUS 1246 What, art thou devout? Wast thou in

1247 prayer?

THERSITES 1248 Ay. The heavens hear me!

[PATROCLUS 1249 40Amen.]

ACHILLES, ⌜within⌝ 1250 Who’s there?

PATROCLUS 1251 Thersites, my lord.

ACHILLES, ⌜within⌝ 1252 Where? Where? O, where?

Enter Achilles.

1253 ⌜To Thersites.⌝ Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my

1254 45 digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my

1255 table so many meals? Come, what’s Agamemnon?

THERSITES 1256 Thy commander, Achilles.—Then, tell me,

1257 Patroclus, what’s Achilles?

PATROCLUS 1258 Thy lord, Thersites. Then, tell me, I pray

1259 50 thee, what’s Thersites?

THERSITES 1260 Thy knower, Patroclus. Then, tell me, Patroclus,

1261 what art thou?

PATROCLUS 1262 Thou must tell that knowest.

ACHILLES 1263 O tell, tell.

THERSITES 1264 55I’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon

1265 commands Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am

1266 Patroclus’ knower, and Patroclus is a fool.

⟨PATROCLUS 1267 You rascal!

THERSITES 1268 Peace, fool. I have not done.

ACHILLES, ⌜to Patroclus⌝ 1269 60He is a privileged man.—Proceed,

1270 Thersites.

THERSITES 1271 Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool,

1272 Thersites is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a

1273 fool.⟩

ACHILLES 1274 65Derive this. Come.

p. 95

THERSITES 1275 Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command

1276 Achilles, Achilles is a fool to be commanded ⟨of

1277 Agamemnon,⟩ Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool,

1278 and this Patroclus is a fool positive.

PATROCLUS 1279 70Why am I a fool?

THERSITES 1280 Make that demand of the ⟨creator.⟩ It suffices

1281 me thou art.

Enter ⌜at a distance⌝ Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor,

Diomedes, Ajax, and Calchas.

1282 Look you, who comes here?

ACHILLES 1283 Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody.—Come in

1284 75 with me, Thersites.⟨He exits.⟩

THERSITES 1285 Here is such patchery, such juggling, and

1286 such knavery. All the argument is a whore and a

1287 cuckold, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions

1288 and bleed to death upon. ⟨Now the dry serpigo on

1289 80 the subject, and war and lechery confound all!⟩

⌜He exits.⌝

AGAMEMNON, ⌜to Patroclus⌝ 1290 Where is Achilles?

PATROCLUS

1291 Within his tent, but ill-disposed, my lord.

AGAMEMNON

1292 Let it be known to him that we are here.

1293 He ⌜shent⌝ our messengers, and we lay by

1294 85 Our ⟨appertainments,⟩ visiting of him.

1295 Let him be told so, lest perchance he think

1296 We dare not move the question of our place

1297 Or know not what we are.

PATROCLUS 1298 I shall say so to him.⌜He exits.⌝

ULYSSES

1299 90 We saw him at the opening of his tent.

1300 He is not sick.

AJAX 1301 Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call

1302 it melancholy if you will favor the man, but, by my

p. 97

1303 head, ’tis pride. But, why, why? Let him show us a

1304 95 cause.—⟨A word, my lord.⟩

⌜He and Agamemnon walk aside.⌝

NESTOR 1305 What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?

ULYSSES 1306 Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.

NESTOR 1307 Who, Thersites?

ULYSSES 1308 He.

NESTOR 1309 100Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his

1310 argument.

ULYSSES 1311 No. You see, he is his argument that has his

1312 argument: Achilles.

NESTOR 1313 All the better. Their fraction is more our wish

1314 105 than their faction. But it was a strong composure a

1315 fool could disunite.

ULYSSES 1316 The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may

1317 easily untie.

⟨Enter Patroclus.⟩

1318 Here comes Patroclus.

NESTOR 1319 110No Achilles with him.

ULYSSES 1320 The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy;

1321 his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.

PATROCLUS, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝

1322 Achilles bids me say he is much sorry

1323 If anything more than your sport and pleasure

1324 115 Did move your greatness and this noble state

1325 To call upon him. He hopes it is no other

1326 But for your health and your digestion sake,

1327 An after-dinner’s breath.

AGAMEMNON 1328 Hear you, Patroclus:

1329 120 We are too well acquainted with these answers,

1330 But his evasion, winged thus swift with scorn,

1331 Cannot outfly our apprehensions.

1332 Much attribute he hath, and much the reason

1333 Why we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,

1334 125 Not virtuously on his own part beheld,

p. 99

1335 Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,

1336 Yea, ⟨and⟩ like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,

1337 Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him

1338 We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin

1339 130 If you do say we think him overproud

1340 And underhonest, in self-assumption greater

1341 Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than

1342 himself

1343 Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,

1344 135 Disguise the holy strength of their command,

1345 And underwrite in an observing kind

1346 His humorous predominance—yea, watch

1347 His course and time, his ebbs and flows, ⟨as⟩ if

1348 The passage and whole ⟨carriage of this action⟩

1349 140 Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add

1350 That, if he overhold his price so much,

1351 We’ll none of him. But let him, like an engine

1352 Not portable, lie under this report:

1353 “Bring action hither; this cannot go to war.”

1354 145 A stirring dwarf we do allowance give

1355 Before a sleeping giant. Tell him so.

PATROCLUS

1356 I shall, and bring his answer presently.

AGAMEMNON

1357 In second voice we’ll not be satisfied;

1358 We come to speak with him.—Ulysses, ⟨enter you.⟩

⟨Ulysses exits, ⌜with Patroclus.⌝⟩

AJAX 1359 150What is he more than another?

AGAMEMNON 1360 No more than what he thinks he is.

AJAX 1361 Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself

1362 a better man than I am?

AGAMEMNON 1363 No question.

AJAX 1364 155Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?

AGAMEMNON 1365 No, noble Ajax. You are as strong, as

1366 valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle,

1367 and altogether more tractable.

p. 101

AJAX 1368 Why should a man be proud? How doth pride

1369 160 grow? I know not what pride is.

AGAMEMNON 1370 Your mind is the clearer, ⟨Ajax,⟩ and your

1371 virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself.

1372 Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own

1373 chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the

1374 165 deed devours the deed in the praise.

AJAX 1375 I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering

1376 of toads.

NESTOR, ⌜aside⌝

1377 And yet he loves himself. Is ’t not strange?

Enter Ulysses.

ULYSSES

1378 Achilles will not to the field tomorrow.

AGAMEMNON

1379 170 What’s his excuse?

ULYSSES 1380 He doth rely on none,

1381 But carries on the stream of his dispose,

1382 Without observance or respect of any,

1383 In will peculiar and in self-admission.

AGAMEMNON

1384 175 Why, will he not, upon our fair request,

1385 Untent his person and share th’ air with us?

ULYSSES

1386 Things small as nothing, for request’s sake only,

1387 He makes important. Possessed he is with greatness

1388 And speaks not to himself but with a pride

1389 180 That quarrels at self-breath. Imagined worth

1390 Holds in his blood such swoll’n and hot discourse

1391 That ’twixt his mental and his active parts

1392 Kingdomed Achilles in commotion rages

1393 And batters down himself. What should I say?

1394 185 He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it

1395 Cry “No recovery.”

AGAMEMNON 1396 Let Ajax go to him.—

p. 103

1397 Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.

1398 ’Tis said he holds you well and will be led

1399 190 At your request a little from himself.

ULYSSES

1400 O Agamemnon, let it not be so!

1401 We’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes

1402 When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord

1403 That bastes his arrogance with his own seam

1404 195 And never suffers matter of the world

1405 Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve

1406 And ruminate himself—shall he be worshipped

1407 Of that we hold an idol more than he?

1408 No. This thrice-worthy and right valiant lord

1409 200 Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,

1410 Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,

1411 As amply ⟨titled⟩ as Achilles is,

1412 By going to Achilles.

1413 That were to enlard his fat-already pride

1414 205 And add more coals to Cancer when he burns

1415 With entertaining great Hyperion.

1416 This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid

1417 And say in thunder “Achilles, go to him.”

NESTOR, ⌜aside to Diomedes⌝

1418 O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.

DIOMEDES, ⌜aside to Nestor⌝

1419 210 And how his silence drinks up ⟨this⟩ applause!

AJAX

1420 If I go to him, with my armèd fist

1421 I’ll ⟨pash⟩ him o’er the face.

AGAMEMNON 1422 O, no, you shall not go.

AJAX

1423 An he be proud with me, I’ll feeze his pride.

1424 215 Let me go to him.

ULYSSES

1425 Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.

AJAX 1426 A paltry, insolent fellow.

p. 105

NESTOR, ⌜aside⌝ 1427 How he describes himself!

AJAX 1428 Can he not be sociable?

ULYSSES, ⌜aside⌝ 1429 220The raven chides blackness.

AJAX 1430 I’ll ⟨let⟩ his humorous blood.

AGAMEMNON, ⌜aside⌝ 1431 He will be the physician that

1432 should be the patient.

AJAX 1433 An all men were of my mind—

ULYSSES, ⌜aside⌝ 1434 225Wit would be out of fashion.

AJAX 1435 —he should not bear it so; he should eat swords

1436 first. Shall pride carry it?

NESTOR, ⌜aside⌝ 1437 An ’twould, you’d carry half.

⟨ULYSSES,⟩ ⌜aside⌝ 1438 He would have ten shares.

AJAX 1439 230I will knead him; I’ll make him supple.

⌜NESTOR, aside⌝ 1440 He’s not yet through warm. Force him

1441 with ⟨praises.⟩ Pour in, pour ⟨in;⟩ his ambition is dry.

ULYSSES, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝

1442 My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.

NESTOR, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝

1443 Our noble general, do not do so.

DIOMEDES, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝

1444 235 You must prepare to fight without Achilles.

ULYSSES

1445 Why, ’tis this naming of him does him harm.

1446 Here is a man—but ’tis before his face;

1447 I will be silent.

NESTOR 1448 Wherefore should you so?

1449 240 He is not emulous, as Achilles is.

ULYSSES

1450 Know the whole world, he is as valiant—

AJAX 1451 A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!

1452 Would he were a Trojan!

NESTOR 1453 What a vice were it in Ajax now—

ULYSSES 1454 245If he were proud—

DIOMEDES 1455 Or covetous of praise—

ULYSSES 1456 Ay, or surly borne—

DIOMEDES 1457 Or strange, or self-affected—

p. 107

ULYSSES, ⌜to Ajax⌝

1458 Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet

1459 250 composure.

1460 Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;

1461 Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature

1462 Thrice famed beyond, ⟨beyond⟩ thy erudition;

1463 But he that disciplined thine arms to fight,

1464 255 Let Mars divide eternity in twain

1465 And give him half; and for thy vigor,

1466 Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield

1467 To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,

1468 Which like a ⟨bourn,⟩ a pale, a shore confines

1469 260⟨Thy⟩ spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,

1470 Instructed by the antiquary times;

1471 He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.—

1472 But pardon, father Nestor, were your days

1473 As green as Ajax’ and your brain so tempered,

1474 265 You should not have the eminence of him,

1475 But be as Ajax.

AJAX 1476 Shall I call you father?

NESTOR

1477 Ay, my good son.

DIOMEDES 1478 Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.

ULYSSES

1479 270 There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles

1480 Keeps thicket. Please it our great general

1481 To call together all his state of war.

1482 Fresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow

1483 We must with all our main of power stand fast.

1484 275 And here’s a lord—come knights from east to west

1485 And ⟨cull⟩ their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.

AGAMEMNON

1486 Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep.

1487 Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.

They exit.
