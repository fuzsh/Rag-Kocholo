        "text": "Thersites mitchellae (Cox, 1864) (Camaenidae) is a regionally endemic Australian land snail that is critically endangered under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). We studied its habitat use and movement patterns. Knowledge of habitat use is relevant to the conservation of the species, and knowledge of movements is relevant to the interpretation of the results of capture-recapture studies and occupancy-based habitat models. We provide quantitative data of nightly distances travelled, the probability of moving on a night, retreat site selection, overnight substrate use and activity. A total of 636 location positions for 11 snails was recorded on 12 nights over an 18-day period. Nocturnal movements measured at approximately 2-hour intervals showed that the mean nightly movement was 457.8 cm. The maximum nightly movement by an individual was 1,575 cm, and the maximum nightly displacement was 1,270 cm. Over the study period, the maximum movement from capture was 74.45 m, and the maximum displacement was 31.80 m. The results show that the probability of moving on a night, and the nightly distance moved once active both increase with increasing humidity up to a maximum and then decline. Whilst individuals did not return to the same retreat site location with any reliability, there is evidence of active and frequent selection of particular retreat site types within selected habitats. Snails most frequently selected sedge retreat in rainforest (66.7%) and in paperbark wetland (59.3%), and despite the scarcity of sedge in palm forest, it was the most frequented retreat site group overall (42.5%). Snails selected palm frond retreats most frequently in the palm forest (66.7%), and coarse woody debris (CWD) was selected in all habitats (17.9%) and most frequently in the palm forest (27.8%). Statistical analysis revealed significant variation among individuals in their relative use of retreat site types, and significant association between the selection of retreat site types and the initial habitat in which the individuals were located.\n\nLand snails are an important yet often neglected component of Australia's biological diversity. Despite high levels of diversity within this group and the identification of many narrow range endemic species as being of conservation concern, there have been few detailed studies that document the ecology and conservation requirements of the group. A range of threats has been suggested, yet relatively few have been rigorously assessed. Whilst factors such as land clearing are readily apparent and have resulted in extinctions, other threats such as climate change are not well understood. This paper reviews studies conducted on terrestrial molluscs in Australia and highlights the need for further targeted ecological research, given the likely level of on-going threats. We urge researchers to apply rigorous approaches to data collection that will enable a deeper understanding of the factors governing distribution and abundance. Approaches used in other areas of conservation biology offer considerable scope for application to land snails and for the development of appropriate conservation strategies.\n\nContinuing the revision of the Camaenidae in the Australian Monsoon Tropics, we employed comparative analyses of morphological features (with a focus on shell and penial anatomy) and genetic markers (with a focus on mitochondrial COI and 16S sequences) to address the systematic relationships of land snails from the Victoria River District, Northern Territory, and adjacent East Kimberley (Western Australia). These analyses revealed that the species under study represented the previously undescribed genus Nanotrachia. This genus differs from all other camaenid genera known from north-western Australia most conspicuously by its small, flat, and ribbed shell. Six species are identified as members of the new genus, four of them new species (Nanotrachia costulata sp. nov., Nanotrachia carinata sp. nov., Nanotrachia coronata sp. nov., Nanotrachia levis sp. nov.). Two further species have already been described previously but assigned to different genera. These species, Ordtrachia intermedia (as the type species of Nanotrachia) and Mouldingia orientalis, are here transferred to Nanotrachia. Like other camaenids from the Australian Monsoon Tropics, species of Nanotrachia are characterized by essentially allopatric distributions, regional endemism, and a patchy distribution across their range.\n\nWe investigated patterns in species richness and similarity in species composition of land snail communities in relation to biogeographic and environmental gradients on continental islands along the Kimberley coastline of Western Australia. The camaenid land snails demonstrated high overall species richness, restricted geographical ranges (mostly to a single island) and almost complete turnover of species among islands. In comparison, the overall number of the smaller non-camaenid land snail species was much lower. They also had much wider distributions and a lower level of species turnover among islands. These results are consistent with the differing dispersal abilities of the two groups, one fostering in situ speciation and the other inter-island colonisation. We also show that dispersal ability was not the only driver of species richness and composition of land snail species on islands, but that rainfall, island area and availability of habitat also played a role. Rainfall was the major environmental driver of richness and composition for both groups of land snails. Rainfall was also highly correlated with extent of rainforest cover, habitat that provides a suitable micro-climate for snails and additional ecological niches compared to more open habitats."
