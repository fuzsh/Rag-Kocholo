This work shows that there are far more species than previously suspected, and that this genus is in fact, a very speciose group of tiny snails widely distributed in Southeast Asia. Angustopila is revised based on type material of known species as well as 211 samples newly collected in China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. Altogether, 53 species and one subspecies are recognised, of which 42 species and subspecies are new to science: A.akrodon Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.apiaria Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.apiostoma Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.apokritodon Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.antidomedon Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.babel Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.bathyodon Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.bidentata Páll-Gergely & Jochum, sp. nov., A.cavicola Páll-Gergely & Dumrongrojwattana, sp. nov., A.cicatricosa Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.coprologosuninodus Páll-Gergely & Grego, ssp. nov., A.erawanica Páll-Gergely & Dumrongrojwattana, sp. nov., A.fratermajor Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.fraterminor Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.gracilis Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.halongensis Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.hyron Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.maasseni Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.majuscula Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.margaritarion Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.megastoma Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.occidentalis Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.oostoma Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.papaver Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.parallela Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.prolixa Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.pusilla Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.pustulata Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.quadridens Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.rara Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.reticulata Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.somsaki Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.steffeki Páll-Gergely & Grego, sp. nov., A.tetradon Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.thersites Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.tonkinospiroides Páll-Gergely & Vermeulen, sp. nov., A.tridentata Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.tweediei Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.uvula Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.vandevenderi Páll-Gergely & Jochum, sp. nov., A.vitrina Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.vomer Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov., A.werneri Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, sp. nov.\n\nAngustopilasubelevata Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, 2015 is moved to the synonymy of Angustopilaelevata (F. G. Thompson & Upatham, 1997), and A.singuladentis Inkhavilay & Panha, 2016 is a junior synonym of A.fabella Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, 2015. Three species, namely A.elevata, A.fabella and A.szekeresi, are widespread over several hundred kilometres while some other species (A.huoyani, A.parallelasp. nov., A.cavicolasp. nov.) are known from just two sites a few hundred kilometres apart. All others are small range or single-site endemics. The reproductive anatomy of A.erawanicasp. nov. is described.\n\nKeywords: Biodiversity, microsnails, systematics, taxonomy\n\nIntroduction\n\nA large fraction of tropical terrestrial snails are “microsnails”, possessing shells that are smaller than 5 mm (Panha and Burch 2005). When the majority of known Southeast Asian snail shells had been collected and described at the end of the 19th century, mostly larger bodied species found their way into private and museum collections via adventurous collectors, travellers, missionaries, and soldiers. However, since microsnails were little known, their numbers have remained a mystery, and their true diversity is still uncertain. So far, the vast majority of microsnail species of Southeast Asia are known from their type localities only. Thus, it is largely unknown whether they are all strictly endemic or if widely distributed species are among them. Although a few studies (Páll-Gergely et al. 2015b, 2021) have shown that some Southeast Asian terrestrial snail species are widely distributed over several hundreds of kilometres, this condition has not yet been observed amongst the smallest microsnails. Probably the only known example is Bensonellaplicidens (Benson, 1849), which was claimed to have a disjunct distribution in the Himalaya and in East Asia, including Japan and eastern China (see Pilsbry 1918; Gittenberger et al. 2021). However, recent study has shown that the Himalayan and East Asian species belong to two distinct species (Páll-Gergely and White 2023).\n\nAngustopila Jochum, Slapnik & Páll-Gergely, 2014 is a genus of land snails known to include the tiniest members of terrestrial gastropods (Páll-Gergely et al. 2015a, 2022; Dumrongrojwattana et al. 2021). Its range spans from Thailand and Vietnam to southern China from twelve localities. So far, only twelve nominal species are known, which are mostly reported from their type localities only.\n\nThe taxonomic history of this genus started at the end of the 20th century. Thompson and Upatham (1997) described two species of Systenostoma Bavay & Dautzenberg, 1909 from Thailand, S.concava Thompson & Upatham, 1997 and S.elevata Thompson & Upatham, 1997. In addition to these species, they recognised three Vietnamese Systenostoma: S.defixa Bavay & Dautzenberg, 1912, S.pauperrima (Bavay & Dautzenberg, 1909) and S.pulverea (Bavay & Dautzenberg, 1909). Later, two Thai species, S.tamlod Panha & Burch, 2002 and S.edentatum Panha & Burch, 2002 were described. Jochum et al. (2014) introduced Tonkinospira Jochum, Slapnik & Páll-Gergely, 2014 as a replacement name for Systenostoma Bavay & Dautzenberg, 1909 (non SystenostomaMarsson 1887, Bryozoa), and included four species: Tonkinospiradefixa, T.depressa (S. Jaeckel, 1950), T.pauperrima and T.pulverea. Tonkinospira currently comprises ten species (Páll-Gergely et al. 2019). Angustopila, a genus differing from Tonkinospira by its smaller shell size, more elevated spire, slightly reflexed peristome, and general presence of dentition within the aperture (Jochum et al. 2014), was described to include A.concava, A.elevata, A.huoyani Jochum, Slapnik & Páll-Gergely, 2014 (from China), A.neglecta (van Benthem-Jutting, 1961) (Malay Peninsula) and A.tamlod, which was designated as the type species. Further species subsequently included in Angustopila are the following: A.dominikae Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, 2015, A.fabella Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, 2015, A.subelevata Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, 2015, A.szekeresi Páll-Gergely & Hunyadi, 2015 (all four from China), A.singuladentis Inkhavilay & Panha, 2016 (Laos) and A.stochi Páll-Gergely & Jochum, 2017 (Vietnam). Angustopilastochi and Paraboysidianeglecta were moved to Clostophis Benson, 1860 due to their larger shell and denser spiral striation (Páll-Gergely et al. 2020; Páll-Gergely and Hunyadi 2022). Later, three additional species, Angustopilapallgergelyi Dumrongrojwattana, Chuenit & Wongkamhaeng, 2021, Angustopilapsammion Páll-Gergely, Vermeulen & Anker, 2022 and A.coprologos Páll-Gergely, Jochum & Hunyadi, 2022 were described (the latter two in Páll-Gergely et al. 2022). Finally, Das et al. (2021) assigned Acmellamilium (Benson, 1853) (originally described as Cyclostoma) to Angustopila, increasing the number of Angustopila species to 13.\n\nThe higher classification of Southeast Asian pupilloid microsnail genera is problematic. Hypselostoma Benson, 1856 and Boysidia Ancey, 1881 were classified in the family Pupillidae by Pilsbry (1917). Later, Zilch (1959) erected Hypselostomatinae Zilch, 1959 and Aulacospirinae Zilch, 1959 within Chondrinidae. These subfamilies were synonymized with Gastrocoptinae by Gittenberger (1973). Schileyko (1998) separated Hypselostomatidae as a distinct family and treated Aulacospirinae as its synonym, while Bouchet et al. (2017) treated Hypselostomatidae as a synonym of Gastrocoptidae Pilsbry, 1918. In recent publications, Angustopila Jochum, Slapnik & Páll-Gergely, 2014 and other probably related microsnail genera were classified in various families such as Pupillidae Turton, 1831 (e.g., Panha and Burch 2002) and Vertiginidae Fitzinger, 1833 (e.g., Inkhavilay et al. 2019). Currently, only one molecular systematic study has been conducted on the family (Tongkerd et al. 2004), revealing that the ‘hypselostomatid’ genera (Anauchen Pilsbry, 1917, Aulacospira Möllendorff, 1890, Gyliotrachela, Hypselostoma, Krobylos Panha & J. B. Burch, 2002) form a monophyletic clade distinct from Vertiginidae and Pupillidae. Unfortunately, no Chondrina Reichenbach, 1828 or Gastrocopta Wollaston, 1878 samples were used, which would have further clarified the relationship of ‘Hypselostomatidae’ with Chondrinidae and Gastrocoptidae. In conjunction with recent works (Jochum et al. 2014; Páll-Gergely et al. 2015a, 2017, 2022; Páll-Gergely and Hunyadi 2022), we treat Angustopila as a member of Hypselostomatidae.\n\nIn this work, we show that there are far more Angustopila species than previously suspected, and that this genus is in fact, a very species-rich group of snails. It becomes clear that these extremely tiny land snails are abundant and widely distributed in Southeast Asia and are not limited to certain areas. The present study is based on the examination of type material of all Angustopila species and 211 newly collected lots. Altogether, 53 species and one subspecies are recognised, of which 42 and the single subspecies herein, are described as new. We also show that three species have wide distributions, indicating that for the description of a new microsnail, it is critical to compare any possibly new species with species from a wide range to establish its novelty.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCollecting methods\n\nRarely (pers. obs. PD), living snails were collected inside caves by picking them individually out of the sediment using fine forceps (see also Dumrongrojwattana et al. 2021). In all other cases, soil samples were either flotated in water (AH, JV) and the dried samples sieved, or they were directly sieved without floating the soil sample (AR). JG washed the cave mud through a large metal sieve installed over a nylon stocking for fine filtration. The dried samples were eventually sorted under stereo microscope.\n\nHandling and imaging of specimens\n\nShells were manually brushed clean of mud using wet, finely tapered brushes. The shells were viewed without coating under a low vacuum SEM (Hitachi Miniscope TM-1000 at Shinshu University, Matsumoto, Japan; Hitachi TM-4000 Plus SEM at the Research and Instrument Core Facility of the Faculty of Science, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary). Shell whorl number was counted to the nearest quarter whorl according to Kerney and Cameron (1979). Images were taken by B. Páll-Gergely if not stated otherwise.\n\nExamined characters\n\nShell size\n\nAll shells were measured using a Keyence Digital microscope. Spire height can vary from depressed (low convex (biscuit shaped)) to high conical, showing continuous variation across species from the most depressed to the highest shell. In each species, we indicate whether the shell is higher than wide, or wider than high, and for the measurements, we indicate the range of shell height to shell width as “H/D*100”.\n\nFor determining the size ranges, we averaged the smallest and largest measurements (shell width in the first, and shell height in the second two categories). The smallest species was A.psammion measuring 0.6 mm (shell diameter) and the largest, A.majuscula sp. nov. measuring 1.31 mm (shell height). The average measurement of all 53 species was 0.89 mm. Hence, small species were between 0.6–0.85 mm, medium-sized species between 0.86–1.05 mm, and large species between 1.06–1.31 mm. All measurement data are compiled in Suppl. material 2.\n\nShape of the dorsal side\n\nShape of the upper (dorsal) side (conical, concave-conical, conical-globular, domed, see Fig. ) is crucial in species recognition.\n\nThe protoconch shape and orientation are never different from what we would expect from the general shell shape (i.e., low in case of depressed shells, high in case of high-spired shells).\n\nShell colour\n\nAll Angustopila shells are colourless (white, off-white, etc., probably depending on the condition of available shells), i.e., never brown, reddish, or yellowish, as in other genera of Hypselostomatidae. Although this trait has little taxonomic value within this genus (but important between genera!), we note whether the shells are conspicuously transparent or not.\n\nAperture orientation\n\nAperture profile can be slightly oblique, moderately oblique, and strongly oblique to the shell axis in lateral view (Fig. ). The angle of the aperture axis compared to the shell axis in apertural view can also be species specific. The relationships of the two axes are categorised into three groups, although there is a continuous variation across species. Namely, they can join under a small, a moderate and a large angle. The apertural axis can also be species specific compared to the shell axis in frontal view (Fig. ).\n\nUmbilicus width\n\nRelative umbilicus diameter (RUD: umbilicus diameter/shell diameter × 100) is often species specific, therefore it is indicated under Measurements under each species (Fig. ).\n\nShape of body whorl\n\nMost species have a rounded body whorl from apertural view, others can have a depressed-rounded form (i.e., very slightly keeled) or shouldered body whorls (Fig. ). In the latter case, the body whorl looks as if it was pushed from the basolateral direction and thus, has a flat profile viewed from the bottom left corner.\n\nSculpture\n\nDue to the small size of Angustopila species, their fine sculpture is usually not visible under a standard stereo microscope (ca. 40× magnification). However, the fine sculpture is usually visible via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the present paper, the description of the fine sculpture is based on 1–3 shells (per population of species) examined via SEM.\n\nThe general fine sculpture of Angustopila species shows a dry, dimpled, pasty texture (like floury pizza dough), also reminiscent of cross-sectional view of trabecular bone. This dimpled, paste-like texture can be denser or less dense with the dimpled surface varying in structural constitution from raised to flat (nearly smooth), but the basic structure is always recognisable. This surface structure forms raised spiral striae on both the teleoconch and the protoconch. In practically all cases, the end of the protoconch just preceding the protoconch-teleoconch boundary, is spirally striated (Fig. ). In some species, the entire protoconch is spirally striated (Fig. ). The density of spiral striation is highly variable (Fig. ). Although examining this structure is difficult due to the limited number of observable shells, the presence/absence of spiral striation at the beginning of the protoconch is probably a species-specific trait.\n\nThe teleoconch is usually similar to the end of the protoconch. Namely, the general paste-like texture forms usually equidistant spiral striae with some growth lines of variable strength (Fig. ). In very rare cases, the shells have very weak, or practically no recognisable spiral striae (Fig. ). In Angustopilapsammion, the spiral striae are dense, and their connection to the basal, paste-like texture is not evident as in other species (Fig. ). Angustopilacoprologos has a rough sculpture with raised, flat-topped (or occasionally pointy) islets arranged like studs fastened onto the shell in spiral rows (Fig. ). In two species (A.pusilla sp. nov. and A.fraterminor sp. nov.), oblique scratches are present between the rows of spiral striae (Fig. ).\n\nThe density of spiral striation is variable within Angustopila, but generally, less than that of similar tiny shells of other SE Asian hypselstomatids possessing colourless shells (Clostophis, Tonkinospira).\n\nAperture shape\n\nWhen describing the aperture shape (Fig. ), we refer to the outer outline of the aperture, i.e., the line of the peristome edge. The shape of the parietal callus (concave, straight, rounded) is crucial. In the case of a concave parietal callus, the aperture shape can be kidney-shaped (reniform) when the aperture is more or less symmetrical, and pear-shaped (piriform), when the sinulus is smaller/more elongate/slenderer than the lower part of the aperture. We can distinguish narrow and broad piriform shapes. The apertures with straight and convex parietal callus can be classified in the following categories:\n\novate-oblong (parietal callus straight, aperture otherwise nearly rounded);\n\nsubcircular (almost rounded);\n\novoid (the sinulus is pointed, the other end of the aperture is rounded);\n\novate (the two ends of the aperture (sinulus and the basal/columellar end) are nearly equally rounded);\n\novate-subquadrate (reminiscent of a rhombus or square).\n\nNaturally, these are artificial categories, and often just as in other taxonomic works describing shapes, these are subject to personal impressions and subjective categories. However, here we present these eight categories in order to provide a standard for the nomenclature we use.\n\nApertural barriers\n\nWe could identify five apertural barrier types in Angustopila (see Fig. ).\n\nThe position of the parietal or angulo-parietal tooth (not clear whether it is homologous with the parietal lamella or the concrescent angular and parietal lamellae of related genera) appears consistent across the entire genus. Therefore, it is probably homologous amongst all Angustopila species. It can be very small, low, pointed (e.g., A.szekeresi), strongly elevated and long (A.vomer sp. nov. and A.prolixa sp. nov.), or entirely absent. Although it can have a club-shaped cross-sectional view (A.uvula sp. nov. and A.margaritarion sp. nov.), it is normally elevated and short in most species. Its depth can also be variable (e.g., deeply situated in A.szekeresi). If it is short and knob-like, its position can be species specific (i.e., A.psammion, A.maasseni sp. nov.).\n\nA denticle in upper position, facing the parietal tooth may be present on the palatal wall. The position of this tooth can be very high (A.akrodon sp. nov., A.bidentata sp. nov., A.majuscula sp. nov., etc.) or somewhat lower (A.parallela sp. nov., A.bathyodon sp. nov.).\n\nIn A.coprologos, there are two teeth on the upper side of the palatal wall. In A.coprologosuninodus ssp. nov., there is only a single palatal tooth, which is similarly aligned as the upper tooth of the nominotypical subspecies. Thus, these are homologous structures. Hence, the lower positioned tooth in A.coprologos is considered homologous with the lower palatal denticle.\n\nA lower palatal denticle is present in several Angustopila species, either together (A.quadridens sp. nov.) or without (A.pustulata sp. nov., A.gracilis sp. nov., A.uvula sp. nov., etc.) an upper palatal denticle. In some cases (e.g., A.parallela sp. nov.), it is difficult to determine whether the single tooth on the palatal lip represents the upper or lower palatal tooth.\n\nRarely, there is a denticle at the junction of the basal and columellar regions (A.vitrina sp. nov., A.hyron sp. nov., A.apiaria sp. nov.). We consider it homologous with the subcolumellar tooth termed by Pilsbry (1948). Alternatively, we remark that the lamella in the same position was termed columellaris by Hausdorf (1996).\n\nThe tooth on the columellar side of A.tridentata sp. nov. is treated differently than that comprising the subcolumellar tooth. However, it is not certain that the two are not homologous because, for example, A.quadridens sp. nov. bears a tooth that is seemingly intermediate between the two positions.\n\nTaxonomic treatment\n\nIn the current revision, only a single species (Angustopilaerawanica sp. nov.) could be anatomically examined. These samples provided some information on the morphology of the reproductive organs of the genus Angustopila, but anatomical traits could not be compared with those of congeners. Therefore, only conchological characters could be examined for species recognition and delimitation. Our approach was to delimit distinct morphotypes based on characters which are either discrete in nature or which are continuous but with distinct gaps. In other words, we mostly used the ‘morphospecies’ concept.\n\nWhen two populations were overall similar but showed stable, clearly recognisable conchological differences (especially regarding apertural denticles), we treated them as separate species (i.e., A.gracilis sp. nov. vs. A.pustulata sp. nov.; A.reticulata sp. nov. vs. A.tweediei sp. nov.). In the case of A.coprologos, shells from the population with a single parietal denticle are separated from those possessing two teeth at the subspecies level because of the similarity of other shell characters and the very small geographic distance.\n\nWhen distinct populations showed some minor conchological differences (mostly minor differences in shell, aperture shape, sculpture), we refrained from describing them as separate species. Instead, we identified the non-type population as ‘cf.’ of the species in question, and did not select them to be paratypes (see under A.cavicola sp. nov., A.fratermajor sp. nov.). Thus, throughout the manuscript, we applied rather a “lumping” approach.\n\nOur revision resulted in the recognition of three widely distributed species (A.elevata, A.fabella, A.szekeresi). Interestingly, conchological variability was low in A.elevata and A.szekeresi despite the large geographic area. However, this was not the case for A.fabella. The populations treated as A.fabella show considerable differences in shell shape (conical, conical-globular, and concave-conical), microstructure and size. In several instances, more than one ‘type’ of A.fabella is found in sympatry or parapatry. In these cases, it was clear that we are referring to two distinct species, and thus, we described one of them as new (see A.babel sp. nov., A.margaritarion sp. nov., A.vandevenderi sp. nov.). Therefore, we had to partly rely on the biological species concept for species having a conical or concave-conical shell shape and a single parietal tooth.\n\nIn some cases, extraordinary diversity was found in a single sample. In one instance (sample 2019/118 of A.fabella), the two sympatric morphs form non-overlapping clusters on the shell diameter vs. shell height diagram. In the other two notable cases (sample 2019/128 of A.fabella and the type sample of A.huoyani), although most shells could be assigned to morphotypes, there was some uncertainty such that the clusters overlapped. In other cases (i.e., Plagigeyeriazetaprotogona, see Grego et al. 2017), our samples may represent thanatocoenoses only, i.e., they were washed together from various, geographically isolated subpopulations and therefore, the co-existence of the various morphs is just artefactual.\n\nSpecies diversity\n\nThe number of unobserved species was estimated for four datasets (areas) (see raw data in Suppl. material 1). Three relatively densely sampled areas (Annamite Mountains, Central Laos, Halong Bay, see Fig. ) were considered in conjunction with the entire dataset. For the latter, we did not include A.milium from NE India because its type locality is situated very far from the nearest Angustopila records. We also lack SEM images of A.milium, making the identity of that species somewhat questionable. We additionally included one species not described in this study (Angustopila sp. 1.). For the Halong Bay, samples collected from the inner and outer sections of the same cave are treated as one.\n\nThe number of unobserved species was estimated by two non-parametric methods from incidence data: bias corrected version of the Chao estimator (Chao2-bc; Chao 2005) and the improved Chao estimator (iChao2; Chiu et al. 2014). The former uses only the number of rarest species (singletons and doubletons) and often underestimates the number of unobserved species. Thus, its value could be interpreted as a lower bound rather than the real value of unobserved diversity. iChao2 improves the estimate based on the Good-Turing frequency formula using the frequency of tripletons and quadrupletons. The cost of the improvement is that it needs more data for a reliable estimation; if sample size is small relative to the species richness, its confidence interval may be extremely wide. All calculations were done by SpadeR package (Chao et al. 2016) in R environment (R Core Team 2021).\n\nAbbreviations\n\nCUMZChulalongkorn University Museum of Zoology (Bangkok, Thailand)\n\nD Shell diameter\n\nH Shell height\n\nHA Collection András Hunyadi (Budapest, Hungary)\n\nHNHMHungarian Natural History Museum (Budapest, Hungary)\n\nj/b juvenile/broken shells\n\nJG Collection Jozef Grego (Banská Bystrica, Slovakia)\n\nJJV Private collection of Jaap Vermeulen (Leiden, The Netherlands)\n\nMCSMNH Malacological collection of the Slovenian Museum of Natural History (Ljubljana, Slovenia)\n\nMNHNMuséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (Paris, France)\n\nNHM The Natural History Museum (London, UK)\n\nNHMUK When citing NHM registered specimens\n\nNHMWNaturhistorisches Museum Wien (Vienna, Austria)\n\nNMBENaturhistorisches Museum der Burgergemeinde Bern (Bern, Switzerland)\n\nPD Collection Pongrat Dumrongrojwattana (Bangsaen, Thailand)\n\nPGB Collection Barna Páll-Gergely (Mosonmagyaróvár, Hungary)\n\nRE Collection Reischütz (Horn, Austria)\n\nRMNH National Museum of Natural History Naturalis (Leiden, The Netherlands)\n\nRUD Relative umbilical diameter\n\nSMFSenckenberg Forschungsinstitut und Naturmuseum (Frankfurt am Main, Germany)\n\nUFFlorida Museum of Natural History (Gainesville, USA)\n\nUMMZMuseum of Zoology, University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA)\n\nUMZC University Museum of Zoology (Cambridge, United Kingdom)\n\nVNMNVietnam National Museum of Nature (Hanoi, Vietnam)\n\nSystematic descriptions\n\nFamily Hypselostomatidae Zilch, 1959\n\nGenus.

transparent when fresh or whitish (practically colourless); conical, concave-conical, conical-globular, globular or depressed-globular, whorls mostly regularly growing, body whorl never detached (although the parietal callus may project from the penultimate whorl); protoconch with or without spiral striae; body whorl with 10–20 (exceptionally up to 22) spiral striae counted from standard apertural view in line with the shell axis; occasionally spiral lines are lacking; peristome expanded, not reflected, aperture with 0–5 teeth, parietal wall with or without 1 tooth; parietal tooth usually elongated, reaches or does not reach parietal callus; other denticles short, situated on or close to peristome; umbilicus open, 14–38% of shell width.\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nSo far, the diagnosis was based on 13 species. Now that there are 53 known Angustopila species, the morphological variability of the genus considerably increased. Even with so many species included, the genus appears “compact” in terms of morphological characters, and in most cases, it is not difficult to identify shells to the genus level.\n\nRegarding apertural denticles, Angustopila is very conservative. All non-parietal apertural barriers are short and situated on or very close to the peristome. The only exception is Angustopilaapiaria sp. nov., in which the palatal and subcolumellar teeth are elongated into the aperture. This, and the relatively disjunct distribution in Central Vietnam may indicate that it warrants a genus of its own.\n\nAmongst Southeast Asian Hypselostomatidae, Dentisphaera Páll-Gergely & Jochum, 2017, Clostophis Benson, 1860 and Tonkinospira Jochum, Slapnik & Páll-Gergely, 2014 are similar to Angustopila in the tiny, colourless shells. Dentisphaera possesses an angular and parietal tooth, which readily distinguishes it from Angustopila, which always has a single tooth on the parietal side. Although Clostophis (see Páll-Gergely et al. 2020) and Tonkinospira (see Páll-Gergely et al. 2019) are possibly synonyms (Páll-Gergely and Hunyadi 2022), discussion however, is beyond the scope of the present paper. Both are characterised by shells larger than 1.2 mm (typically approximately 2 mm). In samples where both Angustopila and Tonkinospira/Clostophis species occur, it is already clear from the size groups, that Angustopila are distinct due to their small size. Moreover, the spiral striation of Tonkinospira/Clostophis is usually denser than that of Angustopila (22–36 ribs on the body whorl in apertural view, compared to usually 10–20 in Angustopila). However, there are three species from the Halong Bay Area (A.megastoma sp. nov., A.thersites sp. nov., and A.tonkinospiroides sp. nov.) that resemble several Tonkinospira species in the irregular growth of the whorls (especially the dominant body whorl), the comparatively large, mostly toothless aperture, and the relatively dense spiral striae. However, due to their small size, we treat these three species as Angustopila, although we remark that future examinations should address this issue.\n\nHabitat.\n\nOnly three species, A.cavicola sp. nov., A.erawanica sp. nov., and A.pallgergelyi (see Dumrongrojwattana et al. 2021) have ever been collected alive, and with no exception in caves, far from the cave entrance, but occasionally also found around the cave entrance. Similarly, empty shells of several other species have only been found in soil samples collected inside caves. However, the majority of shells were found in soil samples collected at the base of large limestone rocks. In is unknown whether those shells have been washed out of caves and deep crevices, or if the living snails live outside of caves. Generally, Angustopila species most probably inhabit moist, deep limestone crevices and caves, close to (or on) root systems.\n\nSoil samples containing Angustopila shells collected in and outside of caves, are mostly dominated by diplommatinids and hydrocenids, while shells of other small-bodied snails (hypselostomatids, alycaeids, diapherids, ‘subulinids’, Microcystina Mörch, 1872, Kaliella W. T. Blanford, 1863, Philalanka Godwin-Austen, 1898, locally assimineids) are also often included, but generally, in smaller quantities.\n\nConservation, threats.\n\nThe majority of Angustopila species are single-site or narrow range endemics. This will not change much, even when more detailed sampling is conducted in the region. Thus, destruction of a habitat of an Angustopila species can easily lead to the disappearance of a species. The most tangible threats to their preferred habitats are quarrying and modifying caves for tourism and recreational purposes.\n\nDistribution.\n\nMost species are known in Southeast Asia (entire Thailand, southern Shan and Kayah states of Myanmar, northern Laos and northern and central Vietnam). A few species are known from the Chinese province of Guangxi and a single record from Hunan. A single species from the Indian state of Meghalaya indicates that the genus is present in the south-eastern Himalaya (Fig. ).\n\nSpecies without apertural barriers\n\nRemarks. For simplicity, species in this revision are grouped based on the number of teeth. This classification probably does not reflect relatedness.\n\nAngustopilamegastoma sp. nov. may lack a parietal tooth. Angustopilaapiostoma sp. nov. may rarely possess a parietal tooth.\n\n.

See also under A.fratermajor sp. nov. and remarks.\n\nEtymology.\n\nThe name apiostoma derives from the Greek ἄπιον (= a pear) and στόμα (= mouth) referring to the pear-shaped aperture (to be used as a noun in apposition).\n\nDistribution.\n\nThis species is known from two nearby localities in the Halong Bay Area, Vietnam (Fig. ).\n\nRemarks.\n\nThe ventral side and the shape of the aperture of A.apiostoma sp. nov. resembles those of Dentisphaeramaxema Páll-Gergely & Jochum, 2017, which has a more protruding aperture (i.e., a longer tuba) and six apertural teeth. However, the two prominent teeth on the parietal side of Dentisphaera distinguishes this genus from Angustopila.\n\n.

Although it was evident that the two species were very similar, we considered the differences (A.elevata had a more slender shell, a deeper umbilicus, and was lacking spiral striae on its base) and the nearly 1000-km distance sufficient to describe A.subelevata as new. The newly collected shells from the type locality of A.elevata showed that it had weak spiral striae on the base. Furthermore, the geographical populations examined between the type localities of A.elevata and A.subelevata indicated that only minor conchological differences exist. Although the area spans nearly 2000 kilometres in a straight line from southern Thailand to Guangxi Province in China, the populations listed here show little variation in terms of conchological characters. Thus, we now treat them as a single species.\n\n.

However, the combination of the shell characters (small, conical shell, narrow, deep umbilicus, toothless, subcircular aperture, expanded aperture, sparsely arranged spiral striae) indicates that this species represents an adult hypselostomatid, which undoubtedly fits to the genus Angustopila, significantly extending the genus distribution.\n\nHere, we do not present a formal redescription because the type specimens could not be examined by SEM, and therefore, some important details cannot be seen. However, due to the large geographic distance between A.milium and other species discussed herein, it is highly unlikely that A.milium would be conspecific with any of them.\n\n.

Distinguishing these two species is sometime difficult because both have quite an irregular shell, and exhibit a rather large intraspecific variability. Nevertheless, there are several differences as follows: A.megastoma sp. nov. is larger, and has a generally lower spire; its aperture is less rounded (rather semilunar because the body whorl is more attached to the penultimate whorl); the spiral striation of A.megastoma sp. nov. is denser and much fainter, in fact it is nearly invisible under the stereo microscope (only visible with SEM); the last whorl of A.megastoma sp. nov. is wider compared to the penultimate whorl than that of A.thersites sp. nov. (in the latter species often the penultimate whorl is wider than the last one in apertural view). See also under A.tonkinospiroides sp. nov.\n\nEtymology.\n\nThis new species is named after Thersites (Θερσίτης = the ugliest Greek soldier laying siege to Troy) referring to the irregularly growing whorls.\n\nDistribution.\n\nThis species is known from several sites in the Halong Bay Area, northern Vietnam (Fig. ).\n\nRemarks.\n\nShells from sample WMVT.0327 are unusually high-spired and are less concave-conical (some of them are even conical) than typical A.thersites sp. nov. shells. Although the differences in shell shape between most shells of sample WMVT.0327 and other A.thersites sp. nov. shells are obvious, the shell with the lowest spire of sample WMVT.0327, and the shell with the highest spire of the other A.thersites sp. nov. samples are very similar. In addition, the strong spiral striation, the aperture shape, the narrow umbilicus, and the very oblique aperture suggests that they are conspecific with A.thersites sp. nov.\n\n.

Angustopilathersites sp. nov. is smaller, and has a concave-conical, more irregularly increasing shell. Angustopilafratermajor sp. nov. is smaller, has a parietal tooth, and possesses a wider umbilicus. Tonkinospira species are usually larger, depressed-conical in shape and have denser spiral striation on both the protoconch and teleoconch.\n\nEtymology.\n\nFirst we considered this species to belong to the genus Tonkinospira. Due to the tonkinospirid aspects (i.e., large conical shell, regularly growing whorls, superficial microstructure and lack of apertural dentition), the specific epithet reflects this similarity.\n\nDistribution.\n\nThis new species is known from two sites in the Halong Bay area in northern Vietnam (Fig. ).\n\n.

See also under A.halongensis sp. nov.\n\nEtymology.\n\nThe new subspecies is dedicated to and named after Ervin Werner (1936–2021), the prominent botanist and biology teacher in secondary school of the first author.\n\nDistribution.\n\nThe two known populations are located ca. 20 kilometres from each other in Lạng Sơn Province, northern Vietnam (Fig. ).\n\nRemarks.\n\nShells from locality 2020/53 have a comparatively smaller aperture than those of the typical shells, but no other differences were found.\n\nSpecies with a single parietal tooth\n\nRemarks.Angustopilamegastoma sp. nov. may lack a parietal tooth. Angustopilaapiostoma sp. nov. may rarely possess a parietal tooth.\n\nThe Angustopila species presented as new in this study are distinguished based on unique character states or a unique combination of character states consisting of shell and aperture shape, apertural barriers, and sculpture. The most challenging effort was to distinguish between species possessing a concave-conical or conical shell (rarely conical-globular) with a single parietal tooth (hereafter termed “difficult Angustopila”). The criteria used to delimit species within this group are listed below. So far, there are two known Angustopila species having a conical shell and a well-developed parietal tooth: A.fabella and A.singuladentis. Since the latter falls within the morphological variability of the former, it is treated as a junior synonym. Typical A.fabella shells are characterised by a high parietal tooth, which is bigger than in most other populations of “difficult Angustopila”. Nevertheless, some “difficult Angustopila” specimens we examined have a similarly large and extensive parietal tooth. Thus, the name A.fabella can be applied to most populations of “difficult Angustopila”.\n\n(1) Strict sympatry: When two or more ‘morphotypes’ of “difficult Angustopila” live in sympatry, they cannot belong to the same species. This was the case for Angustopilamargaritarion sp. nov., which lived in sympatry with Angustopilafabella.\n\n(2) Allopatry: When a ‘morphotype’ of “difficult Angustopila” was geographically surrounded by another ‘morphotype’. This was the case with Angustopilavandevenderi sp. nov., which was surrounded by populations of A.fabella. Additionally, Angustopilababel sp. nov. is also treated as a species different from A.fabella because in the Halong Bay area, besides the A.babel sp. nov.-like populations (conical, narrow umbilicus, parietal tooth reaching parietal callus), there are three lots with different traits (concave-conical, wider umbilicus, parietal tooth not reaching parietal callus) (identified as A.fabella).\n\n(3) Adjunct character: In addition to the conical shell and the single parietal tooth, there is another character that distinguishes a species from other A.fabella populations. For example, A.cavicola sp. nov. has an unusually expanded peristome and a comparatively wide aperture. We note that the non-type sample of A.cavicola sp. nov. (2019/118) lives in sympatry with A.fabella.\n\n.

Some A.fabella populations are, however, strikingly similar in shape. For example, sample 2020/58, which is smaller and has a more deeply situated parietal tooth, and sample 2020/32, which is also smaller, and has a more pointed apex and a smaller aperture.

Both types would otherwise fit the morphological continuum of the widespread and variable Angustopilafabella. However, since the two types are clearly distinct within such a small area, only one of them is identified A.fabella, and the other one must be a distinct species. There are three populations in the Halong Bay area with concave-conical shells bearing a single parietal tooth. Individuals from these populations are identified here as A.fabella. Conversely, the other populations of morphospecies that are conical, have a blunt apex, and possess a single parietal tooth are described as A.babel sp. nov.\n\n.

All other conical species with a single tooth are much smaller than A.cavicola sp. nov.\n\nEtymology.\n\nThis new species was collected inside a cave, in the dark zone (cavicola means cave-dweller in Latin).\n\nDistribution.\n\nThe type series is known from Loei Province, Thailand. An additional, single shell, reminiscent of the typical A.cavicola sp. nov. shells, was collected in Northern Laos ca. 325 km north of the type series (Fig. ).\n\nRemarks.\n\nThe single shell from Laos has an even weaker sculpture (practically smooth) and a lower parietal tooth than the Thai ones. Otherwise, it is similar to the Thai population in terms of shell size, and shell and aperture shapes.\n\n.

Park Headquarters, Trung Trang Cave, steep limestone cliff, woody regrowth at base; 20°47.78'N, 106°59.68'E; 25 Sep. 1998; J.J. Vermeulen & A.J. Whitten leg.; HNHM 103481 (original inventory number: JJV 6270).\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nA small Angustopila species with an ovoid shell, a rather strong, pointed parietal tooth, and very strong, elevated spiral striae.\n\nDescription.\n\nShell small for the genus, as high as wide, transparent, glossy, ovoid, dorsal side nearly domed, body whorl widest from standard apertural view; protoconch consists of 1.5 whorls, with very weak spiral striation preceding the first teleoconch whorl; teleoconch ornamented with irregular, very weak radial growth lines and strong, elevated rows of spiral threads (ca. 14 on body whorl from apertural view); whorls 4, rounded; aperture slightly oblique to shell axis from lateral view; umbilicus wide; aperture reniform; peristome edge slightly thickened and expanded, not reflected; parietal callus separated from penultimate whorl; aperture with a well-developed, deeply situated, pointed (short) parietal tooth.\n\nMeasurements (in mm).\n\nH = 0.68, D = 0.68, H/D*100 = 100, RUD = 27.9 (holotype).\n\nDifferential diagnosis.\n\nThis species is characterised by the small size and the strong spiral striation. Angustopilafraterminor sp. nov. is larger with a higher spire, its shell surface is dull (glossy in A.cicatricosa sp. nov.), the aperture bears a longer parietal tooth (pointed in A.cicatricosa sp. nov.), and its peristome edge is less thickened, rather sharp, and slightly expanded. Angustopilamaasseni sp. nov. also has a duller shell surface with weaker spiral striae, and a lower spire. Angustopilapsammion has a lower spire, a wider umbilicus, and a smaller parietal tooth.\n\nEtymology.\n\nThe specific epithet refers to the scar-like, strong spiral striae.\n\nDistribution.\n\nThis species is only known from the type locality, Trung Trang Cave (Fig. ).\n\nRemarks.\n\nAt first, we considered this individual shell to belong to A.fraterminor sp. nov., to A.maasseni sp. nov., or to A.psammion. However, in addition to the differences regarding shell shape between A.cicatricosa sp. nov. and those two species, A.cicatricosa has an entirely different appearance (strongly striated, glossy) under the microscope. Given that single-site endemic species are not uncommon in the Halong Bay area, we consider this morphologically distinct shell a separate species.\n\n.

We have not found any thickening there that would be similar to the palatal teeth of any other Angustopila species.\n\nAngustopilaconcava is similar to several populations of A.fabella in terms of shell size and the concave-conical shape, but differs from them in the strongly oblique aperture, the strongly sinuous parietal callus, and the conspicuously pointed (slender) sinulus.
