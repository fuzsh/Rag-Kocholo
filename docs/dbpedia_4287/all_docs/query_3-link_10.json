        "text": "Iliad Passages\n\nAchilles Curses Agamemnon Iliad I, ll 262ff (Fagles p 85)\n\nConsider in Book I how the argument between Achilles\n\nand Agamemnon develops. What circumstances bring them together? How does each character see his situation? Are differences in views worth considering?\n\nIs one wrong and the other right? Or is such an argument highly likely, given the characters involved and current circumstances? Homer identifies the rage of Achilles\n\nas ruinous, but understandable given the temperaments and roles of the characters, together with current circumstances. (How also does Chryses engage Apollo\n\nin his dispute with Agamemnon?)\n\nOdysseus Meets Thersites Iliad II ll 245ff (Fagles, p 106)\n\nConsider in Book II the test Agamemnon offers\n\nhis soldiers. The foot soldier Thersites makes\n\nan appealing argument: he and fellow common soldiers\n\nwill likely die in battle without the possibility of fame accorded soldiers superior in ancestry, training, arms\n\nand company. How does his engagement with Odysseus appear to his fellow soldiers and to fighters with seeking fame? (How, incidentally, do Homeric dreams or prophecies really work?)\n\nAphrodite Works Iliad III ll 146ff (Fagles, p 132)\n\nConsider in Book III Helens involvements with\n\nher rival suitors Menelaus and Paris. How does she\n\ncome to consider each suitor at particular times?\n\nHow do her rivals variously act in particular circumstances. How might the tracing of her involvements reveal the powers of Aphrodite?\n\nPandarus Strikes Iliad IV ll 100ff (Fagles, p 148)\n\nConsider in Book IV the attempt by Pandarus to save Troy by killing Menelaus. Athena, of course, tricks Pandarus. But Pandarus understanding of strategy, together with\n\nthe recognized skill with which he approaches his quarry deserves the attention of Homeric audiences. And like reasoning in the face of arguments, Homeric truces\n\nseldom ensure peace.\n\nDiomedes Wounds Ares Iliad V ll 998ff (Fagles, p 192)\n\nConsider in Book V Diomedes as an inspired hero.\n\nHow does his attacks on Ares and on Aphrodite\n\nappear to audiences? Why does Zeus hate Ares\n\nmost of all the Olympian gods? (Consider also\n\nSarpedon, the Trojan supporter favored by Zeus,\n\nwho next to Hector appears as the most\n\nworthy of fame.)\n\nHector Meets Andromache Iliad VI, 439ff (Fagles, p 208)\n\nConsider in Book VI the meeting of Hector and Andromache. How does each consider current circumstances and anticipate specific consequences\n\nof Hectors choices? Homers audiences were primarily Greek. How might Greek audiences appreciate the anticipated futures of Hector, killer of men, and\n\nhis family?\n\nHector Meets Ajax Iliad VII, V ll 236ff (Fagles, p 221)\n\nConsider in Book VII the actions of Hector and Ajax.\n\nIn Book III Paris and Menelaus fought as rivals for Helens favor. Now Hector has challenged Greeks to put forward\n\na Greek fighter to meet him in single combat. Selected\n\nby lot from the nine great fighters who respond to\n\nthe challenge, Ajax is recognized as the clear favorite,\n\na testament to his fighting prowess. What makes\n\nthis extended engagement worth particular attention?\n\nWhat distinguishes each fighter? How does craftsmanship work? When encroaching darkness ends the combat,\n\nhow do fighters and audiences respond?\n\nHera & Athena Face Zeus Iliad VIII, ll 504ff (Fagles, p 245)\n\nConsider in Book VIII the competition among gods\n\nand goddesses. Darkness ended the confrontations\n\nof Ajax and Hector, but the Greeks took from Ajaxs actions faith in their rising power. Now, as darkness grows once more, Hera and Athena, united in inspiring Greeks, find Zeus inspiration of Trojans dispiriting. Homeric audiences would know that Troy eventually falls.\n\nWhat engages them, then, in depictions of Greek suffering, including the prediction that Achilles beloved companion Patroclus will fall before Hector? How does the opposition of Zeus to Hera and Athena work?\n\nPhoenix Counsels Achilles Iliad IX, ll 523ff (Fagles, p 266)\n\nConsider in Book IX the recognition by Agamemnon\n\nthat he must convince Achilles to return to battle.\n\nWhat influences his choice of ambassadors?\n\nWhat conditions does Agamemnon accept?\n\nConsider, for example, the character, actions and\n\naccount presented by Phoenix. How might he expect Achilles to understand the story he offers?\n\nSpies Compete Iliad X, ll 523ff (Fagles, p 291)\n\nConsider in Book X the strategy of Diomedes and Odysseus in undermining Trojan forces. Sleepless\n\nfrom anxiety, Agamemnon together with the wise elder Nestor, initiates a spying mission. Diomedes and Odysseus appear not just as among the greatest\n\nof fighters, but as superior in craft. Hector, equally sleepless, considering how to take advantage of rising Trojan power, initiates his own spying mission. But\n\nthe satisfied Trojans lacking inspiration for such\n\nunheroic activity, send out Dolon, a young untested\n\nfighter, the sole son among five sisters, no match\n\nfor Diomedes and Odysseus. Homeric audiences would know that the Iliad ending, despite the death of Hector, despite the fated death of Achilles, is inconclusive. Odysseus treachery in a surprise attack from within\n\nthe Palladian horse left at Troy as Greeks sail\n\nfrom Troy will make of heroic hand-to-hand combat\n\na fading memory of honor through personal courage.\n\nSarpedon Seeks Fame Iliad XII, ll 337ff (Fagles, p 334)\n\nConsider in Book XII the simile which precedes the challenge Zeus favorite, Sarpedon, offers to his young companion Glaucon. Crowded before each side of Greek ramparts, fighters volley boulders back and forth, so thick they appear to Zeus above as snowflakes, but to men below as instruments of crushing death. When even Hector fails to break through the ramparts, Sarpedon calls to\n\nhis young fellow-fighter Glaucon to rise to the greatest\n\nof risks, to lead Trojans through Greek fortifications.\n\nWhat makes his claim to fame credible and memorable?\n\nHera Seduces Zeus\n\nIliad XIV, ll 187ff (Fagles, p 374)\n\nConsider in Book XIV how Hera, resentful of Zeus,\n\nplans to remove him from action through seduction.\n\nHer likely success appears in the impression she\n\nmakes as Zeus first sees her: at one glance the lust\n\ncame swirling over him, making his heart race, fast as\n\nthe first timeall unknown to their parentsthey rolled\n\nin bed, they locked and surged in love. How does\n\nHera create such an impression?\n\nSarpedons Last Stand\n\nIliad XVI, ll 499ff (Fagles, p 426)\n\nConsider in Book XVI the consequences of Sarpedons encouragement to his friend Glaucon in Book XII before storming Greek ramparts. Most beloved by Zeus of all mortals (for good reason), Sarpedon will not finally escape his fate. Hera reminds Zeus of unfortunate consequences\n\nif immortals undermined fated outcomes, but her stronger reminder would be that not even Zeus can counter fate. (consider also the conditions Achilles imposes on Patroclus, who, armed with Achilles war gear, can\n\nno longer hold back from fighting. Patroclus death\n\nwill change Achilles irrevocably. Patroclus dying words\n\nto Hector anticipate Hectors fated meeting with Achilles.\n\nHector Assumes Achilles Arms\n\nIliad XVII, ll 159ff (Fagles, p 447)\n\nConsider in Book XVII how Sarpedons death leads Hector, armed with the war gear of Achilles, to terrify dispirited Greeks. Glaucus, grieving for Sarpedons death, seeks\n\nto recover his body. Goading Hector for failing to turn back Ajax from defending Patroclus body, and thereby losing the means to exchange Greek for Trojan, Glaucus stirs Hector to call back the arms of Achilles from Troy, to arm himself as Achilles. Greeks will no longer miss Achilles presence foremost among them in battle, but will face Achilles in the person of Hector, killer of men. Zeus, grieveing also for Sarpedon, anticipates Hectors rampage, but anticipates as well the effect it will have on Achilles.\n\nHephaestus Shields Achilles\n\nIliad XVIII, ll 558ff (Fagles, p 483)\n\nConsider in Book XVIII how Achilles rejoins Greek fighters to attack Troy. Unmoved by all offers by Agamemnon\n\nto make amends (consider Agamemnons offer to pick\n\nany of the Kings daughters as a bride!), Achilles discovers his love for Patroclus, and his attending sense of responsibility, moves him personally, moves him with\n\na force greater even than fame, to seek out Hector,\n\nto avenge the death of Patroclus. Not reasonable,\n\nbut impassioned, Achilles turns his rage from Agamemnon to Hector. Passion, not reason, rules. Thetis moves Haephestus, the smith-god, to craft new arms for Achilles, arms crafted with unequaled technology, and with\n\nfearful pictorial craft.\n\nAchilles Goes Berserk\n\nIliad XXI, ll 110ff (Fagles, p 523)\n\nConsider in Book XXI first the rage at work as Achilles slaughters Trojans. How does the death of his beloved companion Patroclus lead him to specific actions? Lyaon, a Trojan prince too young to fight appear before Achilles, cutting fig saplings for chariot wheels. Just eleven days returned by ransom, he hopes his value will once more spare his life. Achilles, Patroclus in mind, will not spare him, but consider his linking of Lyaons fate and his own. Fired up with slaughter, however, Achilles rages against\n\nall life about the River Scamander. What, then, brings about an end to his rampage?\n\nHector Faces Achilles\n\nIliad XXII, ll 293ff (Fagles, p 549)\n\nConsider in Book XXII Hectors reactions to his discovery that the brother he most relies on was nowhere near him, vanished. Aware that Achilles will overcome him, that Achilles vengeance will drive him to feed the corpse\n\nto dogs, Hector none-the-less attacks like a soaring eagle launching down from the dark clouds to earth to snatch some helpless lamb or trembling hare. Can we see Achilles, at the moment of his triumph, as Hector does,\n\nas a helpless lamb or trembling hare?\n\nPatroclus Final Appearance\n\nIliad XXIII, ll 65ff (Fagles, p 561)\n\nConsider in Book XXIII the surprise of Achilles when\n\nthe shade of Patroclus appears, chiding him for forgetfulness and neglect. How does Patroclus help Achilles to recall their relationship in the flesh, and\n\nto recognize the distance between those times\n\nand those to come as shades as shades?"
