        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nAs the general, Agamemnon, and his councillors Nestor and Ulysses discuss the refusal of their principal warriors, Achilles and Ajax, to fight, Aeneas enters to deliver a challenge from Hector to single combat with any Greek. Ulysses and Nestor then scheme to deny Achilles the combat and give it to Ajax because, they say, Achilles is too proud already.\n\n⟨Sennet.⟩ Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes,\n\nMenelaus, with others.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n0454 Princes, what grief hath set ⟨the⟩ jaundice o’er your\n\n0455 cheeks?\n\n0456 The ample proposition that hope makes\n\n0457 In all designs begun on Earth below\n\n0458 5 Fails in the promised largeness. Checks and disasters\n\n0459 Grow in the veins of actions highest reared,\n\n0460 As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,\n\n0461 Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain\n\np. 43\n\n0462 Tortive and errant from his course of growth.\n\n0463 10 Nor, princes, is it matter new to us\n\n0464 That we come short of our suppose so far\n\n0465 That after seven years’ siege yet Troy walls stand,\n\n0466 Sith ⟨every⟩ action that hath gone before,\n\n0467 Whereof we have record, trial did draw\n\n0468 15 Bias and thwart, not answering the aim\n\n0469 And that unbodied figure of the thought\n\n0470 That gave ’t surmisèd shape. Why then, you princes,\n\n0471 Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works\n\n0472 And call them shames, which are indeed naught else\n\n0473 20 But the protractive trials of great Jove\n\n0474 To find persistive constancy in men?\n\n0475 The fineness of which metal is not found\n\n0476 In Fortune’s love; for then the bold and coward,\n\n0477 The wise and fool, the artist and unread,\n\n0478 25 The hard and soft seem all affined and kin.\n\n0479 But in the wind and tempest of her frown,\n\n0480 Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,\n\n0481 Puffing at all, winnows the light away,\n\n0482 And what hath mass or matter by itself\n\n0483 30 Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.\n\nNESTOR\n\n0484 With due observance of ⟨thy⟩ godlike seat,\n\n0485 Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply\n\n0486 Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance\n\n0487 Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,\n\n0488 35 How many shallow bauble boats dare sail\n\n0489 Upon her ⟨patient⟩ breast, making their way\n\n0490 With those of nobler bulk!\n\n0491 But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage\n\n0492 The gentle Thetis, and anon behold\n\n0493 40 The strong-ribbed bark through liquid mountains cut,\n\n0494 Bounding between the two moist elements,\n\n0495 Like Perseus’ horse. Where’s then the saucy boat\n\n0496 Whose weak untimbered sides but even now\n\np. 45\n\n0497 Corrivaled greatness? Either to harbor fled\n\n0498 45 Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so\n\n0499 Doth valor’s show and valor’s worth divide\n\n0500 In storms of Fortune. For in her ray and brightness\n\n0501 The herd hath more annoyance by the breese\n\n0502 Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind\n\n0503 50 Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,\n\n0504 And flies ⌜flee⌝ under shade, why, then the thing of\n\n0505 courage,\n\n0506 As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathize,\n\n0507 And with an accent tuned in selfsame key\n\n0508 55⌜Retorts⌝ to chiding Fortune.\n\nULYSSES 0509 Agamemnon,\n\n0510 Thou great commander, nerves and bone of Greece,\n\n0511 Heart of our numbers, soul and only sprite,\n\n0512 In whom the tempers and the minds of all\n\n0513 60 Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.\n\n0514 Besides th’ applause and approbation,\n\n0515 The which, (⌜to Agamemnon⌝) most mighty for thy\n\n0516 place and sway,\n\n0517 (⌜To Nestor⌝) And thou most reverend for ⟨thy⟩\n\n0518 65 stretched-out life,\n\n0519 I give to both your speeches, which were such\n\n0520 As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece\n\n0521 Should hold up high in brass; and such again\n\n0522 As venerable Nestor, hatched in silver,\n\n0523 70 Should with a bond of air, strong as the axletree\n\n0524 On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears\n\n0525 To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,\n\n0526 Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.\n\n⟨AGAMEMNON\n\n0527 Speak, Prince of Ithaca, and be ’t of less expect\n\n0528 75 That matter needless, of importless burden,\n\n0529 Divide thy lips than we are confident\n\n0530 When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws\n\n0531 We shall hear music, wit, and oracle.⟩\n\np. 47\n\nULYSSES\n\n0532 Troy, yet upon his ⟨basis,⟩ had been down,\n\n0533 80 And the great Hector’s sword had lacked a master\n\n0534 But for these instances:\n\n0535 The specialty of rule hath been neglected,\n\n0536 And look how many Grecian tents do stand\n\n0537 Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.\n\n0538 85 When that the general is not like the hive\n\n0539 To whom the foragers shall all repair,\n\n0540 What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,\n\n0541 Th’ unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.\n\n0542 The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center\n\n0543 90 Observe degree, priority, and place,\n\n0544 Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,\n\n0545 Office, and custom, in all line of order.\n\n0546 And therefore is the glorious planet Sol\n\n0547 In noble eminence enthroned and sphered\n\n0548 95 Amidst the other, whose med’cinable eye\n\n0549 Corrects the influence of evil planets,\n\n0550 And posts, like the commandment of a king,\n\n0551 Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets\n\n0552 In evil mixture to disorder wander,\n\n0553 100 What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,\n\n0554 What raging of the sea, shaking of Earth,\n\n0555 Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors\n\n0556 Divert and crack, rend and deracinate\n\n0557 The unity and married calm of states\n\n0558 105 Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shaked,\n\n0559 Which is the ladder of all high designs,\n\n0560 The enterprise is sick. How could communities,\n\n0561 Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,\n\n0562 Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,\n\n0563 110 The primogeneity and due of birth,\n\n0564 Prerogative of age, crowns, scepters, laurels,\n\n0565 But by degree stand in authentic place?\n\n0566 Take but degree away, untune that string,\n\np. 49\n\n0567 And hark what discord follows. Each thing ⟨meets⟩\n\n0568 115 In mere oppugnancy. The bounded waters\n\n0569 Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores\n\n0570 And make a sop of all this solid globe;\n\n0571 Strength should be lord of imbecility,\n\n0572 And the rude son should strike his father dead;\n\n0573 120 Force should be right, or, rather, right and wrong,\n\n0574 Between whose endless jar justice resides,\n\n0575 Should lose their names, and so should justice too.\n\n0576 Then everything ⟨includes⟩ itself in power,\n\n0577 Power into will, will into appetite,\n\n0578 125 And appetite, an universal wolf,\n\n0579 So doubly seconded with will and power,\n\n0580 Must make perforce an universal prey\n\n0581 And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\n\n0582 This chaos, when degree is suffocate,\n\n0583 130 Follows the choking.\n\n0584 And this neglection of degree it is\n\n0585 That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose\n\n0586 It hath to climb. The General’s disdained\n\n0587 By him one step below, he by the next,\n\n0588 135 That next by him beneath; so every step,\n\n0589 Exampled by the first pace that is sick\n\n0590 Of his superior, grows to an envious fever\n\n0591 Of pale and bloodless emulation.\n\n0592 And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,\n\n0593 140 Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,\n\n0594 Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.\n\nNESTOR\n\n0595 Most wisely hath Ulysses here discovered\n\n0596 The fever whereof all our power is sick.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n0597 The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,\n\n0598 145 What is the remedy?\n\nULYSSES\n\n0599 The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns\n\np. 51\n\n0600 The sinew and the forehand of our host,\n\n0601 Having his ear full of his airy fame,\n\n0602 Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent\n\n0603 150 Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus,\n\n0604 Upon a lazy bed, the live-long day\n\n0605 Breaks scurril jests,\n\n0606 And with ridiculous and silly action,\n\n0607 Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,\n\n0608 155 He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,\n\n0609 Thy topless deputation he puts on,\n\n0610 And, like a strutting player whose conceit\n\n0611 Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich\n\n0612 To hear the wooden dialogue and sound\n\n0613 160 ’Twixt his stretched footing and the scaffollage,\n\n0614 Such to-be-pitied and o’erwrested seeming\n\n0615 He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,\n\n0616 ’Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms ⟨unsquared⟩\n\n0617 Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropped\n\n0618 165 Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff,\n\n0619 The large Achilles, on his pressed bed lolling,\n\n0620 From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,\n\n0621 Cries “Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right.\n\n0622 Now play me Nestor; hem and stroke thy beard,\n\n0623 170 As he being dressed to some oration.”\n\n0624 That’s done, as near as the extremest ends\n\n0625 Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;\n\n0626 Yet god Achilles still cries “Excellent!\n\n0627 ’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,\n\n0628 175 Arming to answer in a night alarm.”\n\n0629 And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age\n\n0630 Must be the scene of mirth—to cough and spit,\n\n0631 And, with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,\n\n0632 Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport\n\n0633 180 Sir Valor dies, cries “O, enough, Patroclus,\n\n0634 Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all\n\n0635 In pleasure of my spleen.” And in this fashion,\n\n0636 All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,\n\np. 53\n\n0637 Severals and generals of grace exact,\n\n0638 185 Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,\n\n0639 Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,\n\n0640 Success or loss, what is or is not, serves\n\n0641 As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.\n\nNESTOR\n\n0642 And in the imitation of these twain,\n\n0643 190 Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns\n\n0644 With an imperial voice, many are infect:\n\n0645 Ajax is grown self-willed and bears his head\n\n0646 In such a rein, in full as proud a place\n\n0647 As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him,\n\n0648 195 Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,\n\n0649 Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites—\n\n0650 A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint—\n\n0651 To match us in comparisons with dirt,\n\n0652 To weaken ⟨and⟩ discredit our exposure,\n\n0653 200 How rank soever rounded in with danger.\n\nULYSSES\n\n0654 They tax our policy and call it cowardice,\n\n0655 Count wisdom as no member of the war,\n\n0656 Forestall prescience, and esteem no act\n\n0657 But that of hand. The still and mental parts\n\n0658 205 That do contrive how many hands shall strike\n\n0659 When fitness calls them on and know by measure\n\n0660 Of their observant toil the enemy’s weight—\n\n0661 Why, this hath not a fingers dignity.\n\n0662 They call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet war;\n\n0663 210 So that the ram that batters down the wall,\n\n0664 For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,\n\n0665 They place before his hand that made the engine\n\n0666 Or those that with the fineness of their souls\n\n0667 By reason guide his execution.\n\nNESTOR\n\n0668 215 Let this be granted, and Achilles’ horse\n\n0669 Makes many Thetis’ sons.⟨Tucket.⟩\n\np. 55\n\nAGAMEMNON 0670 What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.\n\nMENELAUS 0671 From Troy.\n\n⟨Enter Aeneas, ⌜with a Trumpeter.⌝⟩\n\nAGAMEMNON 0672 What would you ’fore our tent?\n\nAENEAS\n\n0673 220 Is this great Agamemnon’s tent, I pray you?\n\nAGAMEMNON 0674 Even this.\n\nAENEAS\n\n0675 May one that is a herald and a prince\n\n0676 Do a fair message to his kingly eyes?\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n0677 With surety stronger than Achilles’ arm\n\n0678 225 ’Fore all the Greekish ⌜host,⌝ which with one voice\n\n0679 Call Agamemnon head and general.\n\nAENEAS\n\n0680 Fair leave and large security. How may\n\n0681 A stranger to those most imperial looks\n\n0682 Know them from eyes of other mortals?\n\nAGAMEMNON 0683 230 How?\n\nAENEAS\n\n0684 Ay. I ask that I might waken reverence\n\n0685 And bid the cheek be ready with a blush\n\n0686 Modest as morning when she coldly eyes\n\n0687 The youthful Phoebus.\n\n0688 235 Which is that god in office, guiding men?\n\n0689 Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n0690 This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy\n\n0691 Are ceremonious courtiers.\n\nAENEAS\n\n0692 Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarmed,\n\n0693 240 As bending angels—that’s their fame in peace.\n\n0694 But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,\n\np. 57\n\n0695 Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and—great\n\n0696 Jove’s accord—\n\n0697 Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas.\n\n0698 245 Peace, Trojan. Lay thy finger on thy lips.\n\n0699 The worthiness of praise distains his worth\n\n0700 If that the praised himself bring the praise forth.\n\n0701 But what the repining enemy commends,\n\n0702 That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure,\n\n0703 250 transcends.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n0704 Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?\n\nAENEAS 0705 Ay, Greek, that is my name.\n\nAGAMEMNON 0706 What’s your ⟨affair,⟩ I pray you?\n\nAENEAS\n\n0707 Sir, pardon. ’Tis for Agamemnon’s ears.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n0708 255 He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.\n\nAENEAS\n\n0709 Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him.\n\n0710 I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,\n\n0711 To set his ⟨sense⟩ on ⟨the⟩ attentive bent,\n\n0712 And then to speak.\n\nAGAMEMNON 0713 260 Speak frankly as the wind;\n\n0714 It is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour.\n\n0715 That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,\n\n0716 He tells thee so himself.\n\nAENEAS 0717 Trumpet, blow ⟨loud⟩!\n\n0718 265 Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;\n\n0719 And every Greek of mettle, let him know\n\n0720 What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.\n\nSound trumpet.\n\n0721 We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy\n\n0722 A prince called Hector—Priam is his father—\n\n0723 270 Who in ⟨this⟩ dull and long-continued truce\n\n0724 Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet\n\n0725 And to this purpose speak: “Kings, princes, lords,\n\np. 59\n\n0726 If there be one among the fair’st of Greece\n\n0727 That holds his honor higher than his ease,\n\n0728 275⟨That seeks⟩ his praise more than he fears his peril,\n\n0729 That knows his valor and knows not his fear,\n\n0730 That loves his mistress more than in confession\n\n0731 With truant vows to her own lips he loves\n\n0732 And dare avow her beauty and her worth\n\n0733 280 In other arms than hers—to him this challenge.\n\n0734 Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,\n\n0735 Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,\n\n0736 He hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer\n\n0737 Than ever Greek did couple in his arms\n\n0738 285 And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,\n\n0739 Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,\n\n0740 To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.\n\n0741 If any come, Hector shall honor him;\n\n0742 If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires\n\n0743 290 The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth\n\n0744 The splinter of a lance.” Even so much.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n0745 This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.\n\n0746 If none of them have soul in such a kind,\n\n0747 We left them all at home. But we are soldiers,\n\n0748 295 And may that soldier a mere recreant prove\n\n0749 That means not, hath not, or is not in love!\n\n0750 If then one is, or hath, ⟨or⟩ means to be,\n\n0751 That one meets Hector. If none else, I am he.\n\nNESTOR, ⌜to Aeneas⌝\n\n0752 Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man\n\n0753 300 When Hector’s grandsire sucked. He is old now,\n\n0754 But if there be not in our Grecian host\n\n0755 A noble man that hath ⟨one⟩ spark of fire\n\n0756 To answer for his love, tell him from me\n\n0757 I’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver\n\n0758 305 And in my vambrace put my withered brawns\n\n0759 And, meeting him, ⟨will⟩ tell him that my lady\n\np. 61\n\n0760 Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste\n\n0761 As may be in the world. His youth in flood,\n\n0762 I’ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.\n\nAENEAS\n\n0763 310 Now heavens forfend such scarcity of ⟨youth!⟩\n\nULYSSES 0764 Amen.\n\n⟨AGAMEMNON⟩\n\n0765 Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand.\n\n0766 To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.\n\n0767 Achilles shall have word of this intent;\n\n0768 315 So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent.\n\n0769 Yourself shall feast with us before you go,\n\n0770 And find the welcome of a noble foe.\n\n⟨All but Ulysses and Nestor exit.⟩\n\nULYSSES 0771 Nestor.\n\nNESTOR 0772 What says Ulysses?\n\nULYSSES\n\n0773 320 I have a young conception in my brain;\n\n0774 Be you my time to bring it to some shape.\n\nNESTOR 0775 What is ’t?\n\nULYSSES 0776 ⟨This ’tis:⟩\n\n0777 Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride\n\n0778 325 That hath to this maturity blown up\n\n0779 In rank Achilles must or now be cropped\n\n0780 Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil\n\n0781 To overbulk us all.\n\nNESTOR 0782 Well, and how?\n\nULYSSES\n\n0783 330 This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,\n\n0784 However it is spread in general name,\n\n0785 Relates in purpose only to Achilles.\n\nNESTOR\n\n0786 True. The purpose is perspicuous as substance\n\n0787 Whose grossness little characters sum up;\n\n0788 335 And, in the publication, make no strain\n\n0789 But that Achilles, were his brain as barren\n\np. 63\n\n0790 As banks of Libya—though, Apollo knows,\n\n0791 ’Tis dry enough—will, with great speed of judgment,\n\n0792 Ay, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose\n\n0793 340 Pointing on him.\n\nULYSSES 0794 And wake him to the answer, think you?\n\nNESTOR\n\n0795 Why, ’tis most meet. Who may you else oppose\n\n0796 That can from Hector bring ⟨his honor⟩ off\n\n0797 If not Achilles? Though ’t be a sportful combat,\n\n0798 345 Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,\n\n0799 For here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute\n\n0800 With their fin’st palate. And, trust to me, Ulysses,\n\n0801 Our imputation shall be oddly poised\n\n0802 In this vile action. For the success,\n\n0803 350 Although particular, shall give a scantling\n\n0804 Of good or bad unto the general;\n\n0805 And in such indexes, although small pricks\n\n0806 To their subsequent volumes, there is seen\n\n0807 The baby figure of the giant mass\n\n0808 355 Of things to come at large. It is supposed\n\n0809 He that meets Hector issues from our choice;\n\n0810 And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,\n\n0811 Makes merit her election and doth boil,\n\n0812 As ’twere from forth us all, a man distilled\n\n0813 360 Out of our virtues, who, miscarrying,\n\n0814 What heart receives from hence a conquering part\n\n0815 To steel a strong opinion to themselves?—\n\n0816 ⟨Which entertained, limbs are his instruments,\n\n0817 In no less working than are swords and bows\n\n0818 365 Directive by the limbs.⟩\n\nULYSSES\n\n0819 Give pardon to my speech: therefore ’tis meet\n\n0820 Achilles meet not Hector. Let us like merchants\n\n0821 First show foul wares and think perchance they’ll sell;\n\n0822 If not, the luster of the better shall exceed\n\n0823 370 By showing the worse first. Do not consent\n\np. 65\n\n0824 That ever Hector and Achilles meet,\n\n0825 For both our honor and our shame in this\n\n0826 Are dogged with two strange followers.\n\nNESTOR\n\n0827 I see them not with my old eyes. What are they?\n\nULYSSES\n\n0828 375 What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,\n\n0829 Were he not proud, we all should share with him;\n\n0830 But he already is too insolent,\n\n0831 And it were better parch in Afric sun\n\n0832 Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes\n\n0833 380 Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foiled,\n\n0834 Why then we do our main opinion crush\n\n0835 In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,\n\n0836 And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw\n\n0837 The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves\n\n0838 385 Give him allowance for the better man,\n\n0839 For that will physic the great Myrmidon,\n\n0840 Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall\n\n0841 His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.\n\n0842 If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,\n\n0843 390 We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,\n\n0844 Yet go we under our opinion still\n\n0845 That we have better men. But, hit or miss,\n\n0846 Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes:\n\n0847 Ajax employed plucks down Achilles’ plumes.\n\nNESTOR\n\n0848 395 Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,\n\n0849 And I will give a taste thereof forthwith\n\n0850 To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.\n\n0851 Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone\n\n0852 Must ⟨tar⟩ the mastiffs on, as ’twere a bone.\n\nThey exit."
