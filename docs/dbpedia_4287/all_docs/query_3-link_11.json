        "text": "Rhapsody 1\n\nAnger [mēnis], goddess, sing it, of Achilles, son of Peleus— 2 disastrous [oulomenē] anger that made countless pains [algea] for the Achaeans, 3 and many steadfast lives [psūkhai] it drove down to Hādēs, 4 heroes’ lives, but their bodies it made prizes for dogs [5] and for all birds, and the Will of Zeus was reaching its fulfillment [telos]— 6 sing starting from the point where the two—I now see it—first had a falling out, engaging in strife [eris], 7 I mean, [Agamemnon] the son of Atreus, lord of men, and radiant Achilles. 8 So, which one of the gods was it who impelled the two to fight with each other in strife [eris]? 9 It was [Apollo] the son of Leto and of Zeus. For he [= Apollo], infuriated at the king [= Agamemnon], [10] caused an evil disease to arise throughout the mass of warriors, and the people were getting destroyed, because the son of Atreus had dishonored Khrysēs his priest. Now Khrysēs had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom [apoina]: moreover he bore in his hand the scepter of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath [15] and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.\n\n“Sons of Atreus,” he cried, “and all other Achaeans, may the gods who dwell in Olympus grant you to destroy the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; [20] but free my daughter, and accept a ransom [apoina] for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Zeus.”\n\nThen the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, son of Atreus [25] who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. “Old man,” said he, “let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your scepter of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old [30] in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my bed; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.”\n\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the shore of the sounding sea [35] and prayed apart to King Apollo, whom lovely fine-haired Leto had borne. “Hear me,” he cried, “O god of the silver bow, you who protects Khrysē and holy Killa and rules Tenedos with your might, hear me O Sminthian God of Plague Apollo. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, [40] or burned your thigh-pieces in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.”\n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from the summits of Olympus, [45] with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, 46 and on his shoulders the arrows made a sound with the rage 47 that trembled within him; his face was as dark as night. 48 He sat himself down away from the ships, and he shot his arrow in the midst of them: 49 there was a terrible [deinos] sound from the silver bow. [50] First he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning. For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon the tenth day Achilles called them together in assembly— [55] moved to do so by Hera, the white-armed goddess, who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them. Then, when they were assembled, fleet Achilles rose and spoke among them.\n\n“Son of Atreus,” said he, “I deem that we should now [60] turn roving home if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet [mantis], or some reader of dreams (for dreams, too, are of Zeus) who can tell us why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, and say [65] whether it is for some vow that we have broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will accept the savor of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take away the plague from us.”\n\nWith these words he sat down, and Kalkhas son of Thestor, wisest of seers, [70] who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilion, through the prophecies with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:\n\n“Achilles, beloved of Zeus, you bid me tell you about the [75] anger [mēnis] of King Apollo, the Arch-Destroyer, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the Achaeans are in subjection. [80] A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a king, who even if he swallows his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge till he has taken it. Consider, therefore, whether or not you will protect me.”\n\nAnd Achilles, the great runner, answered, [85] “Fear not, but speak as it is given to you by the gods. I swear by Apollo, Kalkhas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles you reveal to us, that not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth— [90] no, not even if you name Agamemnon himself, 91 who now boasts to be by far the best of the Achaeans.”\n\nAt that the brave seer [mantis] spoke boldly. “The god,” he said, “is not angry about either a vow or a hecatomb, but for his priest’s sake, whom Agamemnon has dishonored, [95] in that he would neither free his daughter nor take a ransom [apoina] for her. 96 For that reason the far-shooter gave—and will give—pains [algea] upon us, 97 and he will not remove the disgraceful devastation [loigos] from the Danaans 98 until Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom [apoina] to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb [100] to Khrysē. Thus we may perhaps appease him.”\n\nWith these words he sat down, and the warlord Agamemnon, son of Atreus, rose in anger. His heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire [105] as he scowled at Kalkhas and said, “Seer [mantis] of evil, you never yet prophesied good things concerning me, but have always loved to foretell that which was evil. You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come prophesying among the Danaans, and saying [110] that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom [apoina] for this girl, the daughter of Khrysēs. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I prefer her to my own wife Clytemnestra, whom I courted when young, whose peer she is in [115] both form and feature, in intelligence and accomplishments. Still I will give her up if I must, for I want the people to live, not die; but you must find me a prize [geras] instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without one. This is not well; [120] for you see, all of you, that my prize [geras] is to go elsewhere.”\n\nAnd swift godlike Achilles answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond all humankind, how shall the magnanimous Achaeans find you another prize [geras]? We have no common store from which to take one. [125] Those we took from the cities have been divided up; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made already. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Zeus grants that we destroy the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold.”\n\n[130] Then the warlord Agamemnon said, “Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not thus get the better of me in matters of the mind [noos]. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me. Are you to keep your own prize [geras], while I sit tamely under my loss and give up the girl at your bidding? [135] Let the Achaeans find me a prize [geras] in fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or that of Ajax or of Odysseus; and to whomsoever I may come shall regret my coming. [140] But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the present, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Khrysēis of the lovely cheeks also; further, let some chief man among us be in command, [145] either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or godlike Odysseus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the anger of the Arch-Destroyer god.”\n\nAchilles scowled at him and answered, “You are steeped in insolence and lust of gain. [150] With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came to make war here not because the Trojans are responsible [aitioi] for any wrong committed against me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, [155] nor cut down my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both mountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, shameless one, for your pleasure, not ours—to gain satisfaction [tīmē] from the Trojans for you—you with the looks of a dog—and for Menelaos. [160] You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize [geras] for which I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans destroy any rich city of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize [geras] as you do, [165] though it is my hands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the largest, and I must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labor of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better [170] for me to return home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonored to gather gold and substance for you.”\n\nAnd the warlord Agamemnon answered, “Leave if you will, I shall make you no entreaties to stay you. I have others here [175] who will do me honor, and above all Zeus, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as you are, 177 strife [eris] is always dear to you, as well as wars and battles. So what if you are strong? Was it not a god that made you so? Go home, then, with your ships and comrades [180] to lord it over the beloved Myrmidons. I care neither for you nor for your anger [kotos]; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Khrysēis from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers, but I shall come to your tent and [185] take your own beautiful prize Brisēis, that you may learn how much stronger I am than you are, 186 so that any one else will draw back 187 from saying that he is equal to [isos] me [=Agamemnon] and from making himself equal to [homoios] me face to face.” 188 Thus he [= Agamemnon] spoke.\n\nAnd the son of Peleus [= Achilles] felt grief [akhos], and the heart 189 within his shaggy chest was divided [190] whether to draw the sharp sword at his thigh 191 and make the others get up and scatter while he kills the son of Atreus [= Agamemnon], 192 or whether to check his anger [kholos] and restrain his heart [thūmos]. While he was thus of two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its scabbard, Athena came down [195] from the sky (for white-armed Hera had sent her in the love she bore for them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his golden hair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could see her. Achilles turned in amazement, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once knew that she was [200] Athena. “Why are you here,” said he, “daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus? To see the outrage [hubris] of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you—and it shall surely be— [205] he shall pay for this insolence with his life.”\n\nAnd Athena said, “I come from the sky, if you will hear me, to bid you stop your anger [menos]. Hera has sent me, who cares for both of you alike. [210] Cease, then, this quarreling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him if you will, with words, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you—and it shall surely be—that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as splendid by reason of this present outrage [hubris]. Hold, therefore, and obey.”\n\n[215] “Goddess,” answered swift Achilles, the great runner, “whatever anger [kholos] a man may have, he must do as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear the prayers of him who has obeyed them.”\n\nHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, [220] and thrust it back into the scabbard as Athena bade him. Then she went back to Olympus among the other gods [daimones], and to the house of aegis-bearing Zeus.\n\nBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for he had not yet desisted from his anger [kholos]. [225] “Wine-bibber,” he cried, “you with the looks of a dog and the heart of a deer, you never dare to go out with the army of warriors in fight, nor yet with our chosen (best of the Achaeans) men in ambuscade. You shun this as you do death itself. You had rather go round and [230] rob his prizes from any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you are king over a feeble folk. 232 This could be the last time, son of Atreus, that you will be hurling insults. 233 And here’s another thing. I’ll tell it to you, and I will swear on top of it a great oath: 234 I swear by this scepter [skēptron] that I’m holding here, this scepter that will never again have leaves and branches [235] growing out of it—and it never has—ever since it left that place in the mountains where it was cut down. 236 It will never flourish again, since the bronze implement has stripped it 237 of its leaves and its bark. Now the sons of the Achaeans carry it around, 238 holding it in their hands whenever they act as makers of judgments [dikaspoloi], judging what are and what are not divine laws [themis plural], 239 which they uphold, taking their authority from Zeus. This is going to be a big oath. [240] So here is what I say, and I say it most solemnly: the day will come when there will be a longing [pothē] for Achilles, and it will overcome the sons of the Achaeans, 241 overcome them all. When that day comes, there is no way you will be able, no matter how much grief you feel [akh-nusthai], 242 to keep them away from harm. And that is the time when many will be killed at the hands of Hector the man-killer, 243 dying as they fall to the ground. And you will have in your insides a heart [thūmos] that will be all torn up for you, 244 feeling angry about the fact that you have not at all honored the best of the Achaeans.”\n\n[245] Thus spoke [Achilles] the son of Peleus, and he threw the scepter [skēptron] to the ground, 246 that scepter adorned with golden studs driven into it. Then he sat down, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely from his place upon the other side. Then up rose smooth-tongued Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips sweeter than honey. [250] Two generations of men born and bred in sandy Pylos had passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third. With all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:\n\n“Truly,” he said, “a great grief [penthos] has befallen the Achaean land. [255] Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you; therefore be guided by me. [260] Moreover I have been the familiar friend of men even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels. Never again can I behold such men as Perithoös and Dryas, shepherd of his people, or as Kaineus, Exadios, godlike Polyphemus, [265] and Theseus, son of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men ever born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought the fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I came from distant Pylos, and went about among them, [270] for they would have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living could withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent way. [275] Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl away, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles; 277 Don’t you, [Achilles] son of Peleus, be quarrelling with the king, 278 force against force, since it is never an equal [homoiē] honor [tīmē], I mean, the rank inherited 279 by a king holding the scepter, to whom Zeus has given a luminous sign of sovereignty. [280] Even if you [= Achilles] are as mighty as you are, born of a goddess, 281 nevertheless, he [= Agamemnon] is superior in status, since he rules over more subjects. Son of Atreus, check your anger [menos], I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.”\n\n[285] And Agamemnon answered, “Sir, all that you have said is true, but this man wants to become our lord and master: he must be lord of all, king of all, and chief of all, and this shall hardly be. [290] Granted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him the right to speak with railing?”\n\nAchilles interrupted him. “I should be a coward and a good-for-nothing,” he cried, “if I were to give in to you in all things. [295] Order other people about, not me, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say—and lay my saying to your heart—I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl, for those that take were those also that gave. [300] But of all else that is at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others may see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood.”\n\nWhen they had quarreled thus angrily, [305] they rose, and broke up the assembly at the ships of the Achaeans. Achilles, the son of Peleus, went back to his tents and ships with Patroklos, the son of Menoitios and his company, while Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty oarsmen. [310] He escorted fair-cheeked Khrysēis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb for the god. And Odysseus went as chief.\n\n312 Then they went on board and started sailing along the watery pathways. But the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified themselves and cast their impurities into the sea. [315] Then they offered hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea shore, and the smoke with the savor of their sacrifice rose curling up towards the sky. Thus did they busy themselves throughout the army of warriors.\n\nBut Agamemnon did not forget the threat that he had made Achilles, [320] and called his trusty heralds and attendants [therapontes] Talthybios and Eurybates. “Go,” said he, “to the tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take fair-cheeked Brisēis by the hand and bring her here; if he will not give her I shall come [325] with others and take her—which will press him harder.”\n\nHe ordered this directly and dismissed them, 327 and the two went, unwilling, along the shore of the barren sea, till they came to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and his ships, [330] and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak, but he knew them and said, 334“Hail, heralds, messengers of Zeus and of men! [335] draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who has sent you for the girl Brisēis. Therefore, Patroklos, bring her and give her to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal men, [340] and by the fierceness of hard-hearted Agamemnon’s anger, that if ever there will be 341 a need for me to ward off the disgraceful devastation [loigos], they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and 343 knows not a thing when it comes to noticing [noeîn] both backward and forward in time 344 that the Achaeans be safe as they fight at the ships.”\n\n[345] Patroklos did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Brisēis from the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them to the ships of the Achaeans—and the woman was loath to go. Then Achilles went all alone [350] by the side of the hoary sea [pontos], weeping and looking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer to his immortal mother, “Mother,” he cried, “you bore me doomed to live but for a little season; surely Zeus, who thunders from Olympus, might have given me honor [tīmē]. It is not so: he has not honored me. [355] Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonor, and has robbed me of my prize [geras] by force.”\n\nAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was sitting in the depths of the sea hard by the Old One, her father. Soon she rose up like gray mist out of the waves, [360] sat down before him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, “My son, why are you weeping? What is it that gives you grief [penthos]? Keep it not from me in your mind [noos], but tell me, that we may know it together.”\n\nAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, [365] “You know it; why tell you what you know well already? We went to Thebe, the strong city of Eëtion, destroyed it, and brought here the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely fair-cheeked Khrysēis as the prize of Agamemnon; [370] but Khrysēs, priest of Apollo, came to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom [apoina]: moreover he bore in his hand the scepter of Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath, and beseeched all the Achaeans, [375] but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.\n\nThen the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. [380] So he went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick and fast, for the arrows went everywhere among the wide army of the Achaeans. At last a seer [mantis] [385] in the fullness of his knowledge declared to us the oracles of Apollo the Arch-Destroyer, and I myself was first to say that we should appease him. 387 Then an anger took hold of the son of Atreus, and straightaway he stood up 388 and boastfully promised [verb apeileō] a mūthos, which now has come to fulfillment [= verb teleō, from noun telos ‘fulfillment’]. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in a ship [390] to Khrysē, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of Brisēs, whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself.\n\nHelp your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and if you have ever [395] done him service in word or deed, implore the aid of Zeus. Often in my father’s house have I heard you glory in the fact that you alone of the immortals saved the son of Kronos from ruin, when the others, [400] with Hera, Poseidon, and Pallas Athena would have put him in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aigaion, for he has more force [biē] even than his father Ouranos; [405] when therefore he took his seat all-glorious beside the son of Kronos, the other gods were afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all this, clasp his knees, and bid him give aid to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish on the sea shore, [410] that they may reap what joy they may of their king, and that Agamemnon, wide-ruling son of Atreus, may regret his derangement [atē] in offering insult to the best of the fighting Achaeans.”\n\nThetis wept and answered, “My son, woe is me that I should have borne and nursed you. [415] Would indeed that you had lived your span free from all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; [420] nevertheless I will go to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Zeus, if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships, nurse your anger [mēnis] against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight. For Zeus went yesterday to Okeanos, to a feast among the Ethiopians, and the other gods went with him. [425] He will return to Olympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his dwelling paved with bronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade him.”\n\nThen she left him, still furious at the loss of the slim-waisted girl [430] that had been taken by force [biē] from him. Meanwhile Odysseus reached Khrysē with the hecatomb. When they had come inside the harbor they furled the sails and laid them in the ship’s hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mast into its place, [435] and rowed the ship to the place where they would have her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers. They then got out upon the sea shore and landed the hecatomb for Apollo the Archer; Khrysēis also left the ship, [440] and Odysseus led her to the altar to deliver her into the hands of her father. “Khrysēs,” said he, “King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may propitiate the god, [445] who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives.”\n\nSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly, and they orderly arranged the holy hecatomb around the altar of the god. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle over the victims, [450] while Khrysēs lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. “Hear me,” he cried, “O god of the silver bow, that protects Khrysē and holy Killa, and rules Tenedos with your might. Even as you heard me before when I prayed, and you pressed hard upon the Achaeans, [455] so hear me yet again, and fulfil my desire. 456 Ward off now from the Danaans the disgraceful devastation [loigos]!”\n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the victims and killed and flayed them. [460] They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them. 462 And the old man burned them [= the thigh bones] over splinters of wood, and bright wine did he 463 pour over them, while the young men were getting ready for him the five-pronged forks that they were holding in their hands. When the thigh-pieces were burned and they had tasted the innards, [465] they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished their work [ponos] and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, [470] attendants filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.\n\nThus all day long they worshipped the god with song, hymning him, 473 the young warriors of the Achaeans, singing a beautiful paean, and the god took pleasure in his heart [phrenes] at their voices; [475] but when the sun went down and it became dark, they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set sail for the army of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind, [480] so they raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she went. 483 And the ship ran along the waves, on its pathway leading to its destination. When they reached the wide-stretching army of the Achaeans, [485] they drew the vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.\n\nBut Achilles, the son of Peleus in the line of Zeus, stayed at his ships and nursed his anger [mēnis]. [490] He went not to the honor-bringing assembly, and ventured not forth to fight, but gnawed at his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.\n\nNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus, [495] and Zeus led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through the great sky with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty wide-seeing son of Kronos sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. [500] She sat herself down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with her right she caught him under the chin, and besought him, saying,\n\n“Father Zeus, Lord of Sky, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the immortals, hear my prayer, [505] and do honor to my son, whose life is to be cut short so early. But 506 Agamemnon, king of men, 507 has taken away his honor [tīmē]; for he got and keeps his prize [geras], having himself taken it away. Honor him then yourself, Olympian lord of counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans [510] give my son his due and load him with riches in compensation [tīmē].”\n\nZeus sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still kept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. “Incline your head,” said she, “and promise me surely, [515] or else deny me—for you have nothing to fear—that I may learn how greatly you disdain me.”\n\nThen Zeus was much troubled and answered, “I shall have trouble if you set me quarrelling with Hera, for she will provoke me with her taunting speeches; [520] even now she is always railing at me before the other gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back now, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will bring it about as you wish. [525] See, I incline my head that you believe me. This is the most solemn act that I can give to any god. I never retract my word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my head.”\n\n528So spoke [Zeus] the son of Kronos, and with his eyebrows of blue he made a reinforcing [= epi-] nod. 529 Ambrosial were the locks that cascaded from the lord’s [530] head immortal. And he caused great Olympus to quake.\n\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted—Zeus to his house, while the goddess left the splendor of Olympus, and plunged into the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the coming of their father. Not one of them dared [535] to remain sitting, but all stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But Hera, when she saw him, knew that he and the Old One’s daughter, silver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began to upbraid him. [540] “Trickster,” she cried, “which of the gods have you been taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters in secret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could help it, one word of your intentions.”\n\n[545] “Hera,” replied the father of gods and men, “you must not expect to be informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find it hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a matter to myself, [550] you must not pry nor ask questions.”\n\n“Dread son of Kronos,” answered ox-vision Hera, “what are you talking about? I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything. [555] Still, I have a strong misgiving that the Old Man of the Sea’s daughter, silver-footed Thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that you have been promising her to give honor to Achilles, and to kill many people at the ships of the Achaeans.”\n\n[560] “Wife,” said Zeus, master of cloud and storm, “I can do nothing but you suspect me and find it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the more, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I mean to have it so; [565] sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for if I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all the gods were on your side it would profit you nothing.”\n\nThen ox-vision Hera was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat down in silence. [570] But the sky-dwellers were disquieted throughout the house of Zeus, till the cunning artisan Hephaistos began to try and pacify his beloved mother Hera of the white arms. “It will be intolerable,” said he, “if you two fall to wrangling [575] and setting the gods in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother—and she must herself know that it will be better—to make friends with my dear father Zeus, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. [580] If the Olympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can do so, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he will then soon be in a good humor with us.”\n\nAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, [585] and placed it in his mother’s hand. “Cheer up, my dear mother,” said he, “and make the best of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a thrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for there is no standing up against Zeus. [590] Once before when I was trying to help you, he caught me by the foot and flung me from the celestial threshold. All day long from morning till evening was I falling, till at sunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life left in me, till the Sintians came and tended me.”\n\n[595] Ivory-armed Hera smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son’s hands. Then Hephaistos drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served it round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods laughed out a loud approval [600] as they saw him bustling about the celestial dwellings.\n\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and all had their full share, so that everyone was satisfied. Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling out and making response to one another. [605] But when the sun’s glorious light had faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Hephaistos with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Zeus, the Olympian Lord of Thunder, hastened to the bed [610] in which he always slept; and when he had got on top of it he went to sleep, with Hera of the golden throne, by his side.\n\n2019-07-31\n\nReturn to top.\n\nRhapsody 2\n\nNow the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly, but sweet sleep did not take hold of Zeus, for he was thinking how to do honor to Achilles, to destroy many people at the ships of the Achaeans. [5] In the end he thought it would be best to send a false dream to Atreus’ son King Agamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, “False Dream, go to the ships of the flowing-haired Achaeans, [10] into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to word as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; [15] Hera has brought them to her own mind, and woe to the Trojans!”\n\nThe dream went off when it had heard its message, and soon reached the ships of the Achaeans. It sought out Agamemnon, son of Atreus, and found him in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. [20] It hovered over his head in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honored above all his councilors, and said:\n\n“You are sleeping, son of Atreus; [25] one who has the welfare of his assembly of warriors and so much other care upon his shoulders should limit his sleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Zeus, who, though he is not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take [30] Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Hera has brought them over to her own mind, and woe to the Trojans at the hands of Zeus! Remember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape you.”\n\n[35] The dream then left him 36 thinking in his thūmos about things that were not to be: 37 for he thought that he would capture Priam’s city on that very day, 38 the fool; he did not know what things Zeus was planning to do. 39 For he [Zeus] was yet to inflict pains [algea] and groaning [40] on both Trojans and Danaans in battles of power [kratos]. Then presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft khiton so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, [45] and slung his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the imperishable [aphthiton] staff of his father, and came forth to the ships of the bronze-armored Achaeans.\n\nThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might herald day to Zeus and to the other immortals, [50] and Agamemnon sent the criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them and the people gathered then. But first he summoned a meeting of the elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, [55] and when they were assembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.\n\n“My friends,” said he, “I have had a divine dream in the dead of night, and the dream’s face and figure resembled none but Nestor’s. It hovered over my head and said, [60] ‘You are sleeping, son of high-spirited Atreus, breaker of horses; one who has the welfare of his assembly of warriors and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from Zeus, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. [65] He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Hera has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans [70] at the hands of Zeus. Remember this.’ The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the flowing-haired Achaeans. But it will be the right thing [themis] that I should first sound them, and to this end I will tell them to flee with their ships; [75] but do you others go about among the army of warriors and prevent their doing so.”\n\nHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of sandy Pylos with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: “My friends,” said he, “princes and councilors of the Argives, [80] if any other man of the Achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it false, and would have had nothing to do with it. But he has seen 82 who boasts to be by far the best [aristos] of the Achaeans; we must therefore set about getting the people under arms.”\n\nWith this he led the way from the assembly, [85] and the other sceptered kings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the people pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that come forth from some hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers, [90] bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon the wide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumor, messenger of Zeus, urging them ever to the fore. [95] Thus they gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at last they were got into their several places and ceased their clamor. [100] Then powerful King Agamemnon rose, holding his scepter. It was the work of Hephaistos, who gave it to Zeus the son of Kronos. Zeus gave it to the courier Hermes, slayer of Argos, guide and guardian. King Hermes gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and [105] Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his scepter, he addressed the Argives.\n\n[110] “My friends,” he said, “heroes, attendants [therapontes] of Arēs, Zeus, the son of Kronos, has tied me down with atē. Cruel, he gave me his solemn promise that I should destroy the strong-walled city of Priam before returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me [115] go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is the will of strong Zeus, who has laid many a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an [120] Achaean army of warriors, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that they have each been numbered— [125] the Trojans by the counting of their householders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each of our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a company would have to go without its cup-bearer. [130] But they have in the town allies from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being able to destroy the rich city of Ilion. Nine of Zeus’ years are gone; [135] the timbers of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but the work that we came here to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say: [140] let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy of the wide ways.”\n\nWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of them as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to and fro like the waves [145] of the Icarian Sea [pontos], when the east and south winds break from celestial clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps over a field of wheat and the ears bow beneath the blast, even so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries [150] towards the ships, and the dust from under their feet rose skyward. They cheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of them; they began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the sky rang with their glad cries, so eager were they to return.\n\n[155] Then surely the Argives would have had a return [nostos] after a fashion that was not fated. But Hera said to Athena, “Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, the one who cannot be worn down, shall the Argives flee home to their own land over the broad sea, [160] and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the bronze-armored Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the army of warriors, and speak fairly to them, man by man, [165] that they draw not their ships into the sea.”\n\nOwl-vision goddess Athena was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of the Achaeans. There she found Odysseus, peer of Zeus in counsel, [170] standing alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he felt grief [akhos] and was sorry; so she went close up to him and said, “Resourceful Odysseus, noble son of Laertes, [175] are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off home to your own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the army of warriors, [180] and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the sea.”\n\nOdysseus knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak from him and set off to run. His attendant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca, who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, [185] whereon Odysseus went straight up to Agamemnon son of Atreus and received from him his ancestral, imperishable staff. With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.\n\nWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke to him fairly. [190] “Sir,” said he, “this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand by your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not yet know the full mind [noos] of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and before long will visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us at the council to hear what he then said; [195] see to it lest he be angry and do us harm; for the honor [tīmē] of kings is great, and the hand of Zeus is with them.”\n\nBut when he came across some man from some locale [dēmos] who was making a noise, he struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, [200] “What kind of superhuman force [daimōn] has possessed you? Hold your peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and no warrior; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all be kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man must be supreme— [205] one king to whom the son of scheming Kronos has given the scepter and divine laws to rule over you all.”\n\nThus masterfully did he go about among the army of warriors, and the people hurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as the thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, [210] and all the sea [pontos] is in an uproar.\n\nThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue—a man of many words, and those unseemly [= without kosmos]; a monger of sedition, a railer against all who were in authority, rashly but not according to order [kosmos], [215] so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those that came to Troy—bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point, but there was little hair on the top of it. [220] He was hateful to Achilles and Odysseus most of all, 221 because he made a quarrel [neikos] against these two; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse on radiant Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and disgusted, but nevertheless he kept on brawling and bawling at the son of Atreus.\n\n[225] “Agamemnon,” he cried, “what ails you now, and what more do you want? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more gold, [230] which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans, should bring them into such misery. [235] Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us sail home, and leave this man here at Troy to stew in his own prizes of honor, and discover whether or not we were of any service to him. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and see how he has treated him— [240] robbing him of his prize and keeping it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of Atreus, you would never again insult him.”\n\nThus railed Thersites, but radiant Odysseus at once went up to him [245] and rebuked him sternly. “Check your glib tongue, Thersites,” said be, “and babble not a word further. Chide not princes when you have no one to back you. There is no viler creature that has come to Troy with the sons of Atreus. [250] Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor keep harping about homecoming [nostos]. We do not yet know how things are going to be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good success or evil. How dare you berate Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the people, [255] because the Danaans have awarded him so many prizes? I tell you, therefore—and it shall surely be—that if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own head [260] and be no longer called father of Telemachus, or I will take you, strip you stark naked to reveal your shame [aidōs], and whip you out of the assembly till you go blubbering back to the ships.”\n\n[265] Then he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till he dropped and fell weeping. The golden scepter raised a bloody welt on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish as he wiped the tears from his eyes. [270] The people were sorry for him, but they laughed heartily, and one man would turn to his neighbor saying, “Odysseus has done many a good thing before now in fight and council, but he never did the Argives a better turn [275] than when he stopped this man’s mouth from barking any further. He will give the kings no more of his insolence.”\n\nThus said the people. Then Odysseus, ransacker of cities, rose, scepter in hand, and owl-vision Athena [280] in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who were far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:\n\n“King Agamemnon, son of Atreus, the Achaeans are for [285] making you a by-word among all humankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from horse-pasturing Argos, that you should not return till you had destroyed the town of strong-walled Troy, and, like children or widowed women, [290] they murmur and would set off homeward. True it is that they have had toil [ponos] enough to be disheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, [295] but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go home empty-handed after so long a stay— 299 Endure, my near and dear ones [philoi], and stay as long as it takes for us to find out [300] whether Kalkhas is prophesying something that is true or not.\n\n301 For I know this well in my heart, and you all 302 are witnesses, those of you who have not been carried off by the demons of death. 303 It is as if it was yesterday or the day before, when the ships of the Achaeans at Aulis 304 were gathered, portending doom to Priam and the Trojans. [305] Standing around a spring, at a sacred altar, 306 we were sacrificing perfect [telēessai] hecatombs to the immortal ones 307 under a beautiful plane tree, in a place where sparkling water flowed. 308 Then there appeared [phainesthai] a great sign [sēma], a serpent [drakōn] with blood-red markings on its back. 309 Terrifying it was. The Olympian [= Zeus] himself had sent it into the zone of light. [310] It darted out from underneath the altar, and it rushed toward the plane tree. 311 Over there were the nestlings of a sparrow, helpless young things. 312 In the highest branch amidst the leaves they were hiding in fear, 313 eight of them. The ninth was the mother that had hatched the young ones. 314 Then it devoured them, in a way that is pitiful [eleeina], while they were chirping. [315] And their mother was fluttering above, lamenting [oduresthai] for her dear little things. 316 Then it threw its coils around her, catching her by the wing as she was wailing over [amphiakhuia] them. 317 And when it devoured the young ones of the sparrow and the mother as well, 318 the same god that had made it visible [phainein] now made it most visible [arizēlos]. 319 For the son of crafty Kronos now made it into stone. [320] We just stood there, struck with awe [thauma] at what happened, 321 how such frightful portents invaded the hecatombs of the gods. 322 Then, right away, Kalkhas spoke, speaking the words of seers [theopropeîn]: 323 “Why are you speechless, Achaeans with the elaborate hair? 324 Zeus, master of craft, made visible [phainein] this great portent [teras]. [325] It is late in coming, late in reaching its outcome [telos], and its fame [kleos] will never perish. 326 Just as this thing devoured the young ones of the sparrow and the mother as well, 327 eight in number, while the mother made it nine, the one that hatched the young ones, 328 so also we will wage war for that many years in number, 329 and then, on the tenth year, we will capture the city with its broad streets.” [330] Thus spoke that man. And now I see that all these things are reaching their outcome [telos]. 331 So come now, all of you, hold your place, all you Achaeans with the fine shin-guards, 332 stay here until we capture the great city of Priam.”\n\nThen the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with the uproar. [335] Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, then addressed them. “Shame on you,” he cried, “to stay talking here like children, when you should fight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have taken? [340] Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking here shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose; [345] lead the Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to Argos before they have learned whether Zeus be true or a liar. [350] For the mighty son of all-powerful Kronos surely promised that we should succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans. He showed us favorable signs [sēmata] by flashing his lightning on our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go [355] till he has first lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all. [360] But, O king, consider and listen to my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide [krinein] your men, Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if the Achaeans obey you, [365] you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of the gods or the cowardice of men that you shall fail to take the town.”\n\nAnd powerful Agamemnon answered, [370] “Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, that I had among them ten more such councilors, for the city of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should destroy it. [375] But Zeus of the aegis the son of Kronos afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of one mind again, [380] the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal, that our armies of warriors join in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the ordering of your shields; give good feeds to your swift-footed horses, and look your chariots carefully over, [385] that we may do battle the livelong day. 386 There will not be a pause for rest [from battle] in between, not a bit, 387 unless the night comes and separates the ménos from the men. The bands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears, [390] your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to dogs and vultures.”\n\nThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared approval. As when the waves run high [395] before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty headland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as the storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans rise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted their fires at their tents and got dinner, [400] offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Kronos, and invited the princes and elders of his assembly of warriors. [405] First he asked Nestor and King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly Odysseus, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaos came of his own accord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. [410] They stood round the bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and powerful Agamemnon prayed, saying, “Zeus, most glorious, supreme, that dwells in the sky, and rides upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, [415] and its gates are consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the khiton of Hector about his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.”\n\nThus he prayed, but the son of Kronos would not fulfill his prayer. [420] He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil [ponos] continually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal upon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed it. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. [425] These they burned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the innards, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-pieces were burned, and they had tasted the innards, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off; [430] then, when they had finished their work [ponos] and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, began to speak. “King Agamemnon,” said he, [435] “let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that the gods have put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the bronze-armored people to gather at their several ships; we will then go about among the army of warriors, [440] that we may begin fighting at once.”\n\nThus did he speak, and the lord of men Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them, and the people gathered then. [445] The chiefs about the son of Atreus chose their men and marshaled [krinein] them, while owl-vision Athena went among them holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. From it there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen. [450] With this she darted furiously everywhere among the masses of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even than returning home in their ships. [455] As when some great forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armor flashed up into the firmament of the sky.\n\nThey were like great flocks [460] of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way here and there, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes pour from ships and tents [465] on to the plain of the Skamandros, and the ground rang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick upon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in season [hōrā].\n\nAs countless swarms of flies [470] buzz around a herdsman’s homestead in the time [hōrā] of spring when milk is splashing in the pails, even so did the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy them.\n\nThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began, drafting them out [475] as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went powerful King Agamemnon, with a head and face like Zeus the lord of thunder, a waist like Arēs, and a chest like that of Poseidon. [480] As some great bull that lords it over the herds upon the plain, even so did Zeus make the son of Atreus stand peerless among the multitude of heroes.\n\n484 And now, tell me, O Muses, you who live in your Olympian abodes, [485] since you are goddesses and you were there and you know everything, 486 but we [= the Narrator] only hear the kleos and we know nothing 487 —who were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans [= the Achaeans]? 488 But their number I could not tell nor name 489 (not even if I had ten tongues and ten mouths [490] and a voice that was unbreaking, and if a heart of bronze were within me) 491 if the Muses of Olympus, of Zeus the aegis-bearer 492 the daughters, did not remind me, how many came to Troy. 493 But now I will say the leaders [arkhoí] of the ships, and all the ships.\n\nPeneleos, Leitos, [495] Arkesilaos, Prothoenor, and Klonios were chiefs of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, and who held Skhoinos, Skolos, and the highlands of Eteonos, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mykalessos. They also held Harma, Eilesion, and Erythrai; [500] and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe, the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartos; Plataea and Glisas; [505] the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onkhestos with its famous grove of Poseidon; Arne, rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each [510] there were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.\n\nAskalaphos and Ialmenos, sons of Arēs, led the people that dwelt in Aspledon and Orkhomenos the realm of Minyas. Astyokhe a noble maiden bore them in the house of Aktor son of Azeus; for she had gone with Arēs secretly into an upper chamber, [515] and he had lain with her. With these there came thirty ships.\n\nThe Phocians were led by Skhedios and Epistrophos, sons of mighty Iphitos, the son of great-hearted Naubolos. These were they that held Kyparissos, rocky Pytho [Delphi], [520] holy Krisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Kephissos, and Lilaea by the springs of the Kephissos; with their chieftains came forty ships, [525] and they marshaled the forces of the Phocians, which were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.\n\nAjax, the fleet son of Oïleus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, [530] but in use of the spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt in Kynos, Opous, Kalliaros, Bessa, Skarphe, fair Augeiai, Tarphe, and Thronion about the river Boagrios. With him there came forty ships [535] of the Locrians who dwell beyond sacred Euboea.\n\nThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Khalkis, Eretria, Histiaia, rich in vines, Kerinthos upon the sea, and the rock-perched town of Dion; with them were also the men of Karystos and Styra; [540] Elephenor of the lineage of Arēs was in command of these; he was son of Khalkodon, and chief over all the great-hearted Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever strive to tear open the armor of their foes with their long ashen spears. [545] Of these there came fifty ships.\n\n546 And those who held Athens, well-founded city, 547 the district [dēmos] of stout-hearted Erekhtheus, whom once Athena 548 nourished, daughter of Zeus, but the grain-giving earth gave birth to him. 549 and she [Athena] established him in Athens, in her own rich temple, [550] And there he is supplicated, with sacrifices of bulls and rams, 551 by the young men of Athens, each time the seasonal moment comes round. 552 And their leader was Menestheus, son of Peteoos. 553 Never before had there been a mortal man who was equal to [homoios] him [= Menestheus] 554 in marshaling [kosmeîn] the horse-drawn chariot teams and the shield-bearing warriors. [555] Nestor could alone rival him, for he was older. With him there came fifty ships.\n\nAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside those of the Athenians.\n\nThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, [560] with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Trozen, Eionai, and the vineyard lands of Epidauros; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomedes of the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelos son of famed Kapaneus. [565] With them in command was Euryalos, a godlike man, son of king Mekisteus, son of Talaos; but Diomedes of the great war cry was chief over them all. With these there came eighty ships.\n\nThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, [570] rich Corinth and Kleonai; Orneai, lovely Araithyrea, and Likyon, where Adrastos reigned of old; Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aigion [575] and all the coast-land round about Helike; these sent a hundred ships under the command of powerful King Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far both finest and most numerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all glorious in his armor of gleaming bronze—foremost among the heroes, [580] because he was the best [aristos], and he led the most numerous host.\n\nAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, Pharis, Sparta, with Messe, the haunt of doves; Bryseai, lovely Augeiai, Amyklai, and Helos upon the sea; [585] Laas, moreover, and Oitylos; these were led by Menelaos of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. Among them went Menelaos himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for he longed to [590] avenge the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the sake of Helen.\n\nThe men of Pylos and lovely Arene, and Thryon where is the ford of the river Alpheus; strong-built Aepy, Kyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleon, Helos, and Dorion, where the Muses [595] met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy for ever. He was returning from Oikhalia, where Eurytos lived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus, if they should sing against him; whereon they were angry, and maimed him. [600] They robbed him of his divine power of song, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were commanded by Nestor, charioteer of Gerenia, and with him there came ninety ships.\n\nAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, near the tomb of Aipytos, where the people fight hand to hand; [605] the men of Pheneus also, and Orkhomenos rich in flocks; of Rhipai, Stratie, and bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelos and Parrhasia; of these powerful King Agapenor, son of Ankaios, was commander, [610] and they had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good warriors, came in each one of them, but Agamemnon found them the ships in which to cross the sea [pontos], for they were not a people that occupied their business upon the waters.\n\n[615] The men, moreover, of Bouprasion and of radiant Elis, so much of it as is enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinos upon the sea shore, the rock Olene and Alesion. These had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many Epeioi on board. [620] Their chiefs were Amphimakhos and Thalpios—the one, son of Kteatos, and the other, of Eurytos—both of the lineage of Aktor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynkes, and godlike Polyxenos, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas.\n\n[625] And those of Doulikhion with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt beyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Arēs, and the son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Zeus, who quarreled with his father, and went to settle in Doulikhion. [630] With him there came forty ships.\n\nOdysseus led the brave Kephallēnians, who held Ithaca, Neriton with its forests, Crocyleia, rugged Aigilips, Samos and Zakynthos, [635] with the mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led by Odysseus, peer of Zeus in counsel, and with him there came twelve ships.\n\nThoas, son of Andraimon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in Pleuron, Olenos, Pylene, [640] Khalkis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the great high-hearted king Oineus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was also golden-haired Meleagros, who had been set over the Aetolians to be their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.\n\n[645] The famous spearman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Knossos, and the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyktos also, Miletus and silver-shining Lykastos that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaistos and Rhytion, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete. [650] All these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of manslaughtering Arēs. And with these there came eighty ships.\n\nTlepolemos, son of Hēraklēs, a man both brave and large of stature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. [655] These dwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindos, Ialysos, and Kameiros, that lies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemos, son of mighty Hēraklēs and born of Astyochea, whom he had carried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, [660] after destroying many cities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemos grew up, he killed his father’s uncle Likymnios, scion of Arēs, who had been a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. Then he built himself a fleet, gathered a great following, [665] and fled beyond the sea [pontos], for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons of Hēraklēs. After a voyage during which he suffered great hardship, he came as a wanderer to Rhodes, where the people divided into three communities, according to their tribes, and were dearly loved by Zeus, the lord of gods and men; [670] wherefore the son of Kronos who is lord over all gods and all men, showered down great riches upon them.\n\nAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme —Nireus, who was the handsomest man that came up under Ilion of all the Danaans after the perfect son of Peleus— [675] but he was a man of no substance, and had but a small following.\n\nAnd those that held Nisyros, Karpathos, and Kasos, with Kos, the city of Eurypylos, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippos and Antiphos, two sons of King Thessalos the son of Hēraklēs. [680] And with them there came thirty ships.\n\nThose again who held Pelasgian Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and those of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; [685] these had fifty ships, over which Achilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for swift-footed radiant Achilles stayed by his ships, furious about the loss of the girl of the lovely hair, Brisēis, whom he had taken from Lyrnessos at his own great peril, [690] when he had destroyed Lyrnessos and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes, the furious spearman, and Epistrophos, sons of king Euenor, son of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still in grief [akhos], but before long he was again to join them.\n\n[695] And then there were those that held Phylake and Pyrasos, with its flowery meadows, 696 precinct of Demeter; and Iton, the mother of sheep; 697 Antron upon the sea, and Pteleon that lies upon the grass lands. 698 Of these men the Arēs-like Protesilaos had been leader 699 while he was still alive, but now he was held down by the black earth that covered him. [700] He had left a wife behind him in Phylake to tear both her cheeks in sorrow, 701 and his house was only half completed [hēmi-telēs]. He was killed by a Dardanian warrior 702 while he was leaping out from his ship [on Trojan soil], and he was the very first of the Achaeans to make the leap. 703 Still, his people were not without a leader, though they longed [potheîn] for their leader. 704 But now his people were organized [kosmeîn] by Podarkes, attendant [ozos] of Arēs. [705] He [= Podarkes] was son of Iphiklos, rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylakos, 706 and he [= Podarkes] was the blood brother of Protesilaos, the one with the great heart [thūmos]. 707 But he [= Podarkes] was younger, Protesilaos being both older and more Arēs-like, 708 yes, that hero [hērōs] Protesilaos, the Arēs-like. Still, his people were not 709 without a leader, though they longed [potheîn] for him [= Protesilaos], noble [esthlos] man that he was. [710] With him there came forty ships.\n\nAnd those that held Pherai by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrai, and the strong-founded populous city of Iolkos, these with their eleven ships were led by Eumelos, dear son of Admetos, [715] whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest of the daughters of Pelias. And those that held Methone and Thaumakia, with Meliboia and rugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen [720] all of them good archers; but Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and in grief [akhos], [725] and full soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his people, though they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, the bastard son of Oïleus by Rhene, set them in array.\n\nThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, [730] and they that held Oikhalia, the city of Oikhalian Eurytos, these were commanded by the two sons of Asklepios, skilled in the art of healing, Podaleirios and Makhaon. And with them there came thirty ships. The men, moreover, of Ormenios, and by the fountain of Hypereia, [735] with those that held Asterios, and the white crests of Titanos, these were led by Eurypylos, the shining son of Euaimon, and with them there came forty ships.\n\nThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white city of Oloösson, [740] of these brave Polypoites, stubborn in battle, was leader. He was son of Perithoös, who was son of Zeus himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Perithoös on the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages and drove them from Mount Pelion to the Aithikes. [745] But Polypoites was not sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the lineage of Arēs, who was son of high-hearted Koronos, the son of Kaineus. And with these there came forty ships.\n\nGouneus brought two and twenty ships from Kyphos, and he was followed by the Enienes and the valiant Perrhaiboi, [750] who dwelt about wintry Dodona, and held the lands round the lovely river Titaresios, which sends its waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; [755] for the Titaresios is a branch of dread Orkos and of the river Styx, the fearful oath-river.\n\nOf the Magnetes, Prothoös son of Tenthredon was commander. They were they that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mount Pelion. Prothoös, fleet of foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.\n\n[760] So now, these were the leaders of the Danaans and their lords. 761 Who, then, was by far the best [aristos] —tell me, Muse! —of men or horses, among those that followed after the sons of Atreus?\n\nOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest. They were driven by Eumelos, and were as fleet as birds. [765] They were of the same age and color, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo, of the silver bow, had bred them in Perea—both of them mares, and terrifying as Arēs in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, 769 so long as Achilles was angry; for he was by far the best [phertatos], for Achilles the blameless son of Peleus excelled him greatly [770] and he had also better horses; but Achilles was now holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon, shepherd of the people, and his people passed their time upon the sea shore, throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, [775] and in archery. Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing lotus and wild celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners, for lack of leadership, wandered here and there about the army of warriors and went not forth to fight.\n\n[780] Thus marched the army like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned beneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land about Typhoeus among the Arimoi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even so did the earth groan beneath them [785] as they sped over the plain.\n\nAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Zeus of the aegis to tell the bad news among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young, at Priam’s gates, [790] and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the voice of Priam’s son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aisyetes, to look out for any attack of the Achaeans. [795] In his likeness Iris the swift-running spoke, saying, “Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand. I have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such an army of warriors as is now advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as [800] thick as leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all others, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about the city of Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues. [805] Therefore, let each chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally in array and leading them forth to battle.”\n\nThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once broke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened, and the people thronged through them, [810] horse and foot, with the tramp as of a great multitude.\n\nNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the plain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb [sēma] of lithe dancing Myrrhine. [815] Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.\n\nPriam’s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the Trojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant of those who were longing for the fray.\n\nThe Dardanians were led by brave [820] Aeneas, whom divine Aphrodite bore to Anchises, when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of Antenor, Arkhilokhos and Akamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.\n\nThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mount Ida, [825] men of substance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aisepos, and are of Trojan blood—these were led by Pandaros shining son of Lykaon, whom Apollo had taught to use the bow.\n\nThey that held Adrasteia and the locale [dēmos] of Apaisos, with Pityeia, and the high mountain of Tereia— [830] these were led by Adrastos and Amphios, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Perkote, who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to destruction.\n\n[835] They that dwelt about Perkote and Praktios, with Sestos, Abydos, and radiant Arisbe—these were led by Asios, son of Hyrtakos, a brave commander— Asios, the son of Hyrtakos, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of the breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.\n\n[840] Hippothoös led the tribes of Pelasgian spearmen, who dwelt in fertile Larissa—Hippothoös, and Pylaios of the lineage of Arēs, two sons of the Pelasgian Lethos, son of Teutamos. Akamas and the warrior Peiroös commanded the Thracians [845] and those that came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.\n\nEuphemos, son of Troizenos, the son of Keos, was chief of the spear-carrying Kikones. Pyraikhmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the broad waters of the river Axios, [850] the fairest that flow upon the earth.\n\nThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaimenes from Enetai, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held Kytoros and the country round Sesamos, with the cities by the river Parthenios, [855] Kromna, Aigialos, and lofty Erythinoi.\n\nOdios and Epistrophos were chiefs over the Halizonoi from distant Alybe, where there are mines of silver. Khromis, and Ennomos the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in augury availed not to save him from destruction, [860] for he fell by the hand of the fleet descendant of Aiakos in the river, where he slew others also of the Trojans.\n\nPhorkys, again, and noble godlike Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far country of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.\n\nMesthles and Antiphos commanded the Maeonians, [865] sons of Talaimenes, born to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Maeonians, who dwelt under Mount Tmolos.\n\nNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander and the lofty crests of Mount Mykale. [870] These were commanded by Nastes and Amphimakhos, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the fleet descendant of Aiakos, [875] and Achilles bore away his gold.\n\nSarpedon and Glaukos led the Lycians from their distant land, by the eddying waters of the Xanthos.\n\n2019-12-12\n\nReturn to top.\n\nRhapsody 3\n\nWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own chief, the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream overhead when rain and winter [5] drive them over the flowing waters of Okeanos to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently, in high heart, and minded to stand by one another.\n\n[10] As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man can see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust from under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.\n\n[15] When they were close up with one another, Alexandros1 the godlike came forward as champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet him in single fight. [20] Menelaos the warlike saw him stride out thus before the ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcass of some goat or horned stag, [25] and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him. In this way was Menelaos glad when his eyes caught sight of godlike Alexandros, thinking now that he should take his revenge, and so he sprang from his chariot, clad in his suit of armor.\n\n[30] Alexandros the godlike quailed as he saw Menelaos come forward, and shrank in fear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some mountain glade, [35] even so did godlike Alexandros plunge into the throng of haughty Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son of Atreus.\n\nThen Hector upbraided him. “Paris,”2 said he, “evil-hearted Paris, fair to see, but woman-crazed, and false of tongue, [40] would that you had never been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced and looked at askance. Will not the flowing-haired Achaeans mock at us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to look at [45] but has neither might [biē] in his heart nor any strength? Even so, did you not gather together oarsmen as your companions and set sail on the sea [pontos]? Did you not carry off a lovely woman from a far country, already wedded among a people of warriors— [50] to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and your whole locale [dēmos], but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you not dare face warlike Menelaos and learn what manner of man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your lyre and your love-tricks, [55] your comely locks and your fair favor, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed people, or before this you would have had a shirt of stones for the wrongs you have done them.”\n\nAnd Alexandros the godlike answered, “Hector, your rebuke is just. [60] You are hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your mind [noos]. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Aphrodite has given me; [65] they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaos the warlike, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats, [70] while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others go home [75] to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.”\n\nWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they all sat down at his bidding: [80] but the flowing-haired Achaeans still aimed at him with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, “Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak.”\n\n[85] They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. “Hear from my mouth,” said he, “Trojans and strong-greaved Achaeans, the saying of Alexandros, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and Achaeans lay their armor upon the ground, [90] while he and warlike Menelaos fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace.”\n\n[95] Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaos of the loud battle-cry addressed them. “And now,” he said, “hear me too, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of Achaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much you have suffered [100] for my quarrel with Alexandros and the wrong he did me. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Zeus. [105] Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Zeus must not be transgressed or taken in vain. Young men’s minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he looks before [110] and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon both sides.”\n\nThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they thought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots toward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armor, laying it down upon the ground; [115] and the armies were near to one another with a little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while powerful Agamemnon told Talthybios to fetch the other lamb from the ships, [120] and he did as Agamemnon had said.\n\nMeanwhile Iris went to Helen of the white arms in the form of her sister-in-law, wife of the son of Antenor, for strong Helikaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodike, the fairest of Priam’s daughters. [125] She [= Iris] found her [= Helen] in the palace. She was weaving a great web, 126a purple [porphureē] fabric that folds in two [= diplax], and she was inworking [en-passein] many ordeals [athloi] 127 of Trojans, tamers of horses, and of Achaeans, wearers of bronze khitons, 128—ordeals that they suffered at the hands of Arēs all because of her. Iris then came close up to her and said, [130] “Come here, child, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and bronze-armored Achaeans. Till now they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they have left off fighting, [135] and are leaning upon their shields, sitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandros and Menelaos the warlike are going to fight about yourself, and you are to the wife of him who is the victor.”\n\nThus spoke the goddess, and Helen’s heart yearned [140] after her former husband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over her head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids, Aithra, daughter of Pittheus, and ox-vision Klymene. [145] And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\n\nThe two sages, Oukalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthoös, Thymoetes, Lampos, Klytios, and Hiketaon, of the lineage of Arēs. [150] These were too old to fight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicadas that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they saw Helen coming towards the tower, [155] they said softly to one another, “There is no way to wish for retribution [nemesis] that Trojans and strong-greaved Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of a woman so marvelously and divinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, let them take her and go, [160] or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us.”\n\nBut Priam bade her draw near. “My child,” said he, “take your seat in front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen and your friends. I lay no blame [aitiā] upon you, it is the gods, not you who are responsible [aitioi]. [165] It is they that have brought about this terrifying war with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely [170] and so royal. Surely he must be a king.”\n\n“Sir,” answered Helen, shining among women, “father of my husband, dear and reverend in my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, [175] my darling daughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the hero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, widely powerful son of Atreus, a good king and a brave warrior, [180] brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable self.”\n\nThe old man marveled at him and said, “Happy son of Atreus, child of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great multitudes. [185] When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of Otreus and of godlike Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river Sangarios; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers of men, came up against them, [190] but even they were not so many as the glancing-eyed Achaeans.”\n\nThe old man next looked upon Odysseus; “Tell me,” he said, “who is that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the chest and shoulders? [195] His armor is laid upon the ground, and he stalks in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his ewes.”\n\nAnd Helen answered, [200] “He is resourceful Odysseus, a man of great craft, son of Laertes. He was born in the rugged locale [dēmos] of Ithaca, and excels in all manner of stratagems and subtle cunning.”\n\nThen Antenor said, “Madam, you have spoken truly. [205] Radiant Odysseus once came here as envoy about yourself, and warlike Menelaos with him. I received them in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and conversation. When they stood up in the presence of the assembled Trojans, [210] Menelaos was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Odysseus had the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message, and the speech of Menelaos ran smoothly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was a man of few words, [215] but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though he was the younger man of the two; resourceful Odysseus, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful movement of his scepter; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpracticed in oratory— [220] one might have taken him for a mere churl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked like.”\n\n[225] Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, “Who is that great and goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of the Argives?”\n\n“That,” answered Helen, “is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, [230] and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus, looking like a god, and with the chiefs of the Cretans round him. Often did Menelaos receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, [235] many other glancing-eyed Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor [Kastor], breaker of horses, and Pollux [Polydeukes], the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon, [240] or else, though they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought upon them.”\n\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.\n\n[245] Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through the city—two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and Idaios brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to Priam and said, [250] “Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armored Achaeans bid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandros and warlike Menelaos are to fight for Helen in single combat, [255] that she and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.”\n\nThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers [260] yoke the horses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot, gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans [265] they left the chariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space between the armies of warriors.\n\nAgamemnon, lord of men, and resourceful Odysseus both rose to meet them. The attendants brought on the oath-offerings and [270] mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they poured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus drew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs’ heads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean princes, [275] and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. 276 “O Father Zeus, ruler of Ida, most renowned and greatest, 276 and O Helios (Sun), who oversees and hears all, Earth and Rivers, and you who in the realms below chastise the spirit of him that has broken his oath, [280] witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain. If Alexandros kills Menelaos, let him keep Helen and all her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if fair-haired Menelaos kills Alexandros, [285] let the Trojans give back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover pay such penalty [tīmē] to the Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter. And if Priam and his sons refuse such penalty [tīmē] when Alexandros has fallen, [290] then will I stay here and fight on till I have got satisfaction [telos].”\n\nAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and laid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had robbed them of their strength. [295] Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and Achaeans among one another, “Zeus, most great and glorious, and you other everlasting gods, [300] grant that the brains of them who shall first sin against their oaths—of them and their children—may be shed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of strangers.”\n\nThus they prayed, but not as yet would Zeus, son of Kronos, grant them their prayer. Then Priam, descendant of Dardanos, spoke, saying, “Hear me, Trojans and you strong-greaved Achaeans, [305] I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilion: I dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and warlike Menelaos, for Zeus and the other immortals alone know which shall fall [telos].”\n\n[310] Then he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two then went back to Ilion. Hector, son of Priam, and radiant Odysseus [315] measured the ground, and cast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first. Meanwhile the two armies of warriors lifted up their hands and prayed saying, [320] “Father Zeus, that rules from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he who first brought about this war between us may die, and enter the house of Hādēs, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths.”\n\nGreat Hector of the shining helmet now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet, [325] and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several stations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying, while radiant Alexandros, husband of lovely-haired Helen, put on his goodly armor. [330] First he covered his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with ankle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother Lykaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded sword [335] of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a terrifying spear that suited his hands. In like fashion warlike Menelaos also put on his armor.\n\n[340] When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans, breakers of horses, and strong-greaved Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the measured ground, [345] brandishing their spears, and each furious against the other. Alexandros aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point. [350] Menelaos next took aim, praying to Father Zeus as he did so. “King Zeus,” he said, “grant me revenge on radiant Alexandros who has wronged me; su"
