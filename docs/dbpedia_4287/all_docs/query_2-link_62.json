        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nThersites rails against Achilles and Ajax, and then, joined by Achilles and Patroclus, ridicules them to their faces. As Agamemnon and his councillors approach, Achilles goes inside his tent and refuses to meet them. The Greek leaders then heap praise on Ajax to prepare him to take up Hector’s challenge.\n\nEnter Thersites, alone.\n\n⌜THERSITES⌝ 1210 How now, Thersites? What, lost in the\n\n1211 labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry\n\n1212 it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O, worthy\n\n1213 satisfaction! Would it were otherwise, that I could\n\n1214 5 beat him whilst he railed at me. ’Sfoot, I’ll learn to\n\n1215 conjure and raise devils but I’ll see some issue of\n\n1216 my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a\n\n1217 rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine\n\n1218 it, the walls will stand till they fall of\n\n1219 10 themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,\n\n1220 forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods;\n\n1221 and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy\n\n1222 caduceus, if you take not that little, little, less than\n\n1223 little wit from them that they have, which short-armed\n\n1224 15 ignorance itself knows is so abundant\n\n1225 scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly\n\n1226 from a spider without drawing their massy irons\n\n1227 and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on\n\n1228 the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache!\n\n1229 20 For that, methinks, is the curse depending\n\n1230 on those that war for a placket. I have said my\n\n1231 prayers, and devil Envy say “Amen.”—What ho,\n\n1232 my lord Achilles!\n\nPATROCLUS, ⌜within⌝ 1233 Who’s there? Thersites? Good\n\n1234 25 Thersites, come in and rail.\n\nTHERSITES 1235 If I could ’a remembered a gilt counterfeit,\n\n1236 thou couldst not have slipped out of my contemplation.\n\n1237 But it is no matter. Thyself upon thyself! The\n\n1238 common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance,\n\n1239 30 be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from\n\n1240 a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy\n\n1241 blood be thy direction till thy death; then if she\n\n1242 that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I’ll be\n\np. 93\n\n1243 sworn and sworn upon ’t she never shrouded any\n\n1244 35 but lazars. Amen.\n\n⟨Enter Patroclus.⟩\n\n1245 Where’s Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS 1246 What, art thou devout? Wast thou in\n\n1247 prayer?\n\nTHERSITES 1248 Ay. The heavens hear me!\n\n[PATROCLUS 1249 40Amen.]\n\nACHILLES, ⌜within⌝ 1250 Who’s there?\n\nPATROCLUS 1251 Thersites, my lord.\n\nACHILLES, ⌜within⌝ 1252 Where? Where? O, where?\n\nEnter Achilles.\n\n1253 ⌜To Thersites.⌝ Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my\n\n1254 45 digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my\n\n1255 table so many meals? Come, what’s Agamemnon?\n\nTHERSITES 1256 Thy commander, Achilles.—Then, tell me,\n\n1257 Patroclus, what’s Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS 1258 Thy lord, Thersites. Then, tell me, I pray\n\n1259 50 thee, what’s Thersites?\n\nTHERSITES 1260 Thy knower, Patroclus. Then, tell me, Patroclus,\n\n1261 what art thou?\n\nPATROCLUS 1262 Thou must tell that knowest.\n\nACHILLES 1263 O tell, tell.\n\nTHERSITES 1264 55I’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon\n\n1265 commands Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am\n\n1266 Patroclus’ knower, and Patroclus is a fool.\n\n⟨PATROCLUS 1267 You rascal!\n\nTHERSITES 1268 Peace, fool. I have not done.\n\nACHILLES, ⌜to Patroclus⌝ 1269 60He is a privileged man.—Proceed,\n\n1270 Thersites.\n\nTHERSITES 1271 Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool,\n\n1272 Thersites is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a\n\n1273 fool.⟩\n\nACHILLES 1274 65Derive this. Come.\n\np. 95\n\nTHERSITES 1275 Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command\n\n1276 Achilles, Achilles is a fool to be commanded ⟨of\n\n1277 Agamemnon,⟩ Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool,\n\n1278 and this Patroclus is a fool positive.\n\nPATROCLUS 1279 70Why am I a fool?\n\nTHERSITES 1280 Make that demand of the ⟨creator.⟩ It suffices\n\n1281 me thou art.\n\nEnter ⌜at a distance⌝ Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor,\n\nDiomedes, Ajax, and Calchas.\n\n1282 Look you, who comes here?\n\nACHILLES 1283 Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody.—Come in\n\n1284 75 with me, Thersites.⟨He exits.⟩\n\nTHERSITES 1285 Here is such patchery, such juggling, and\n\n1286 such knavery. All the argument is a whore and a\n\n1287 cuckold, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions\n\n1288 and bleed to death upon. ⟨Now the dry serpigo on\n\n1289 80 the subject, and war and lechery confound all!⟩\n\n⌜He exits.⌝\n\nAGAMEMNON, ⌜to Patroclus⌝ 1290 Where is Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS\n\n1291 Within his tent, but ill-disposed, my lord.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n1292 Let it be known to him that we are here.\n\n1293 He ⌜shent⌝ our messengers, and we lay by\n\n1294 85 Our ⟨appertainments,⟩ visiting of him.\n\n1295 Let him be told so, lest perchance he think\n\n1296 We dare not move the question of our place\n\n1297 Or know not what we are.\n\nPATROCLUS 1298 I shall say so to him.⌜He exits.⌝\n\nULYSSES\n\n1299 90 We saw him at the opening of his tent.\n\n1300 He is not sick.\n\nAJAX 1301 Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call\n\n1302 it melancholy if you will favor the man, but, by my\n\np. 97\n\n1303 head, ’tis pride. But, why, why? Let him show us a\n\n1304 95 cause.—⟨A word, my lord.⟩\n\n⌜He and Agamemnon walk aside.⌝\n\nNESTOR 1305 What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?\n\nULYSSES 1306 Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.\n\nNESTOR 1307 Who, Thersites?\n\nULYSSES 1308 He.\n\nNESTOR 1309 100Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his\n\n1310 argument.\n\nULYSSES 1311 No. You see, he is his argument that has his\n\n1312 argument: Achilles.\n\nNESTOR 1313 All the better. Their fraction is more our wish\n\n1314 105 than their faction. But it was a strong composure a\n\n1315 fool could disunite.\n\nULYSSES 1316 The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may\n\n1317 easily untie.\n\n⟨Enter Patroclus.⟩\n\n1318 Here comes Patroclus.\n\nNESTOR 1319 110No Achilles with him.\n\nULYSSES 1320 The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy;\n\n1321 his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.\n\nPATROCLUS, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝\n\n1322 Achilles bids me say he is much sorry\n\n1323 If anything more than your sport and pleasure\n\n1324 115 Did move your greatness and this noble state\n\n1325 To call upon him. He hopes it is no other\n\n1326 But for your health and your digestion sake,\n\n1327 An after-dinner’s breath.\n\nAGAMEMNON 1328 Hear you, Patroclus:\n\n1329 120 We are too well acquainted with these answers,\n\n1330 But his evasion, winged thus swift with scorn,\n\n1331 Cannot outfly our apprehensions.\n\n1332 Much attribute he hath, and much the reason\n\n1333 Why we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,\n\n1334 125 Not virtuously on his own part beheld,\n\np. 99\n\n1335 Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,\n\n1336 Yea, ⟨and⟩ like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,\n\n1337 Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him\n\n1338 We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin\n\n1339 130 If you do say we think him overproud\n\n1340 And underhonest, in self-assumption greater\n\n1341 Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than\n\n1342 himself\n\n1343 Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,\n\n1344 135 Disguise the holy strength of their command,\n\n1345 And underwrite in an observing kind\n\n1346 His humorous predominance—yea, watch\n\n1347 His course and time, his ebbs and flows, ⟨as⟩ if\n\n1348 The passage and whole ⟨carriage of this action⟩\n\n1349 140 Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add\n\n1350 That, if he overhold his price so much,\n\n1351 We’ll none of him. But let him, like an engine\n\n1352 Not portable, lie under this report:\n\n1353 “Bring action hither; this cannot go to war.”\n\n1354 145 A stirring dwarf we do allowance give\n\n1355 Before a sleeping giant. Tell him so.\n\nPATROCLUS\n\n1356 I shall, and bring his answer presently.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n1357 In second voice we’ll not be satisfied;\n\n1358 We come to speak with him.—Ulysses, ⟨enter you.⟩\n\n⟨Ulysses exits, ⌜with Patroclus.⌝⟩\n\nAJAX 1359 150What is he more than another?\n\nAGAMEMNON 1360 No more than what he thinks he is.\n\nAJAX 1361 Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself\n\n1362 a better man than I am?\n\nAGAMEMNON 1363 No question.\n\nAJAX 1364 155Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?\n\nAGAMEMNON 1365 No, noble Ajax. You are as strong, as\n\n1366 valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle,\n\n1367 and altogether more tractable.\n\np. 101\n\nAJAX 1368 Why should a man be proud? How doth pride\n\n1369 160 grow? I know not what pride is.\n\nAGAMEMNON 1370 Your mind is the clearer, ⟨Ajax,⟩ and your\n\n1371 virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself.\n\n1372 Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own\n\n1373 chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the\n\n1374 165 deed devours the deed in the praise.\n\nAJAX 1375 I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering\n\n1376 of toads.\n\nNESTOR, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1377 And yet he loves himself. Is ’t not strange?\n\nEnter Ulysses.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1378 Achilles will not to the field tomorrow.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n1379 170 What’s his excuse?\n\nULYSSES 1380 He doth rely on none,\n\n1381 But carries on the stream of his dispose,\n\n1382 Without observance or respect of any,\n\n1383 In will peculiar and in self-admission.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n1384 175 Why, will he not, upon our fair request,\n\n1385 Untent his person and share th’ air with us?\n\nULYSSES\n\n1386 Things small as nothing, for request’s sake only,\n\n1387 He makes important. Possessed he is with greatness\n\n1388 And speaks not to himself but with a pride\n\n1389 180 That quarrels at self-breath. Imagined worth\n\n1390 Holds in his blood such swoll’n and hot discourse\n\n1391 That ’twixt his mental and his active parts\n\n1392 Kingdomed Achilles in commotion rages\n\n1393 And batters down himself. What should I say?\n\n1394 185 He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it\n\n1395 Cry “No recovery.”\n\nAGAMEMNON 1396 Let Ajax go to him.—\n\np. 103\n\n1397 Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.\n\n1398 ’Tis said he holds you well and will be led\n\n1399 190 At your request a little from himself.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1400 O Agamemnon, let it not be so!\n\n1401 We’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes\n\n1402 When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord\n\n1403 That bastes his arrogance with his own seam\n\n1404 195 And never suffers matter of the world\n\n1405 Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve\n\n1406 And ruminate himself—shall he be worshipped\n\n1407 Of that we hold an idol more than he?\n\n1408 No. This thrice-worthy and right valiant lord\n\n1409 200 Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,\n\n1410 Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,\n\n1411 As amply ⟨titled⟩ as Achilles is,\n\n1412 By going to Achilles.\n\n1413 That were to enlard his fat-already pride\n\n1414 205 And add more coals to Cancer when he burns\n\n1415 With entertaining great Hyperion.\n\n1416 This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid\n\n1417 And say in thunder “Achilles, go to him.”\n\nNESTOR, ⌜aside to Diomedes⌝\n\n1418 O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.\n\nDIOMEDES, ⌜aside to Nestor⌝\n\n1419 210 And how his silence drinks up ⟨this⟩ applause!\n\nAJAX\n\n1420 If I go to him, with my armèd fist\n\n1421 I’ll ⟨pash⟩ him o’er the face.\n\nAGAMEMNON 1422 O, no, you shall not go.\n\nAJAX\n\n1423 An he be proud with me, I’ll feeze his pride.\n\n1424 215 Let me go to him.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1425 Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.\n\nAJAX 1426 A paltry, insolent fellow.\n\np. 105\n\nNESTOR, ⌜aside⌝ 1427 How he describes himself!\n\nAJAX 1428 Can he not be sociable?\n\nULYSSES, ⌜aside⌝ 1429 220The raven chides blackness.\n\nAJAX 1430 I’ll ⟨let⟩ his humorous blood.\n\nAGAMEMNON, ⌜aside⌝ 1431 He will be the physician that\n\n1432 should be the patient.\n\nAJAX 1433 An all men were of my mind—\n\nULYSSES, ⌜aside⌝ 1434 225Wit would be out of fashion.\n\nAJAX 1435 —he should not bear it so; he should eat swords\n\n1436 first. Shall pride carry it?\n\nNESTOR, ⌜aside⌝ 1437 An ’twould, you’d carry half.\n\n⟨ULYSSES,⟩ ⌜aside⌝ 1438 He would have ten shares.\n\nAJAX 1439 230I will knead him; I’ll make him supple.\n\n⌜NESTOR, aside⌝ 1440 He’s not yet through warm. Force him\n\n1441 with ⟨praises.⟩ Pour in, pour ⟨in;⟩ his ambition is dry.\n\nULYSSES, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝\n\n1442 My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.\n\nNESTOR, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝\n\n1443 Our noble general, do not do so.\n\nDIOMEDES, ⌜to Agamemnon⌝\n\n1444 235 You must prepare to fight without Achilles.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1445 Why, ’tis this naming of him does him harm.\n\n1446 Here is a man—but ’tis before his face;\n\n1447 I will be silent.\n\nNESTOR 1448 Wherefore should you so?\n\n1449 240 He is not emulous, as Achilles is.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1450 Know the whole world, he is as valiant—\n\nAJAX 1451 A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!\n\n1452 Would he were a Trojan!\n\nNESTOR 1453 What a vice were it in Ajax now—\n\nULYSSES 1454 245If he were proud—\n\nDIOMEDES 1455 Or covetous of praise—\n\nULYSSES 1456 Ay, or surly borne—\n\nDIOMEDES 1457 Or strange, or self-affected—\n\np. 107\n\nULYSSES, ⌜to Ajax⌝\n\n1458 Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet\n\n1459 250 composure.\n\n1460 Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;\n\n1461 Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature\n\n1462 Thrice famed beyond, ⟨beyond⟩ thy erudition;\n\n1463 But he that disciplined thine arms to fight,\n\n1464 255 Let Mars divide eternity in twain\n\n1465 And give him half; and for thy vigor,\n\n1466 Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield\n\n1467 To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,\n\n1468 Which like a ⟨bourn,⟩ a pale, a shore confines\n\n1469 260⟨Thy⟩ spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,\n\n1470 Instructed by the antiquary times;\n\n1471 He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.—\n\n1472 But pardon, father Nestor, were your days\n\n1473 As green as Ajax’ and your brain so tempered,\n\n1474 265 You should not have the eminence of him,\n\n1475 But be as Ajax.\n\nAJAX 1476 Shall I call you father?\n\nNESTOR\n\n1477 Ay, my good son.\n\nDIOMEDES 1478 Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1479 270 There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles\n\n1480 Keeps thicket. Please it our great general\n\n1481 To call together all his state of war.\n\n1482 Fresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow\n\n1483 We must with all our main of power stand fast.\n\n1484 275 And here’s a lord—come knights from east to west\n\n1485 And ⟨cull⟩ their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n1486 Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep.\n\n1487 Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.\n\nThey exit."
