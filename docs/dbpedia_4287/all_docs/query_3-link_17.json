        "text": "The other gods and the men who marshal chariots\n\nslept through the night, but sweet sleep evaded\n\nZeus, for he debated in his mind how to honor\n\nAchilles and slay many beside the Achaean ships.\n\nHe soon concluded that the best plan was to send\n\na terrible dream to Atreus’ son, Agamemnon,\n\nso he called to Dream with his winged words:\n\n“Go quickly, destructive Dream, to the swift ships\n\nof the Achaean, and there you will enter the tent\n\nof Agamemnon and whisper to him this message:\n\ntell him to quickly arm the long-haired Achaeans,\n\nfor the time has come to seize Troy’s wide streets.\n\nThe gods with homes on Olympus are no longer\n\ndivided, for Hera has bent their minds to her will,\n\nand Troy has been fated for sorrow and death.”\n\nSo he spoke, and when Dream heard these words\n\nhe quickly set off for the Achaean swift ships.\n\nWhen he reached Agamemnon’s tent, he found\n\nthe son of Atreus fast asleep in ambrosial slumber.\n\nHe stood over him in the form of Nestor, son\n\nof Neleus, whom Agamemnon honors above all\n\nothers. In this guise divine Dream addressed him:\n\n“Why do you sleep, son of Atreus, tamer of horses?\n\nIt is unwise to spend all night at rest when leading\n\nan army and making so many difficult decisions.\n\nNow listen, for I bring word from Zeus, who,\n\nwhile far away, still cares for you and pities you.\n\nYou must quickly arm the long-haired Achaeans,\n\nfor the time has come to seize Troy’s wide streets.\n\nThe gods with homes on Olympus are no longer\n\ndivided, for Hera has bent their minds to her will,\n\nand Troy has been fated for sorrow and death\n\nby Zeus’ order. Remember these words; do not let\n\nthem escape when you wake from sleep slumber.”\n\nDream finished and departed, leaving the king\n\nto consider in his heart things that were never\n\nto be. He foolishly wished to attack Priam’s city\n\non this day, unaware that Zeus already had a plan\n\nto inflict great pain and suffering on both Trojans\n\nand Danaans by bringing them into violent conflict.\n\nHe awoke from sleep with the divine voice pooling\n\nin his ears. He sat up straight, donned his soft,\n\nnewly-made tunic, covered it with his large cloak,\n\nlaced a pair of sandals to his shining feet, and hung\n\nhis silver-studded sword over his shoulders. Then he\n\nseized his father’s imperishable scepter and carried\n\nit over to the ships of the bronze-clad Achaeans.\n\nWhen Dawn rose on high Olympus, declaring\n\ndaylight’s arrival to Zeus and the other immortals,\n\nAgamemnon ordered the clear-voiced herald\n\nto summon the long-haired Achaeans to assembly.\n\nThe cry went out, and the army quickly gathered.\n\nFirst, he called for the council of elders to sit\n\nbeside the ship of Nestor, the king born in Pylos.\n\nWhen all had assembled, he revealed his plan:\n\n“Listen, friends. Last night while I slept, a dream\n\nfrom the gods came to me in a form that looked\n\nlike noble Nestor in features and stature and build.\n\nIt stood over my head and spoke these words:\n\n‘Why do you sleep, son of Atreus, tamer of horses?\n\nIt is unwise to spend all night at rest when leading\n\nan army and making so many difficult decisions.\n\nNow listen, for I bring word from Zeus, who,\n\nwhile far away, still cares for you and pities you.\n\nYou must quickly arm the long-haired Achaeans,\n\nfor the time has come to seize Troy’s wide streets.\n\nThe gods with homes on Olympus are no longer\n\ndivided, for Hera has bent their minds to her will,\n\nand Troy has been fated for sorrow and death\n\nby Zeus’ order. Remember these words.’ When\n\nfinished, Dream left, and I awoke from sweet\n\nsleep. So let us go now and arm Achaea’s sons,\n\nbut first I will test their mettle, as is tradition,\n\nand order them to take their ships and flee\n\nwhile the rest of you order them to hold back.”\n\nWhen he finished, he returned to his seat,\n\nand Nestor, king of sandy Pylos, stood to address\n\nthe assembly with the best of intentions, saying:\n\n“Friends, leaders, and rulers of the Argives,\n\nif any other Achaean had told us this dream,\n\nwe would call it a lie and turn our backs on it.\n\nBut he who claims to be the greatest Achaean\n\nsaw it, so let us go and arm the Achaean sons.”\n\nHe finished and led the way out of the council.\n\nThe scepter-bearing kings obediently followed\n\ntheir leader, and the soldiers hurried after them.\n\nIn the same way that thick swarms of bees burst\n\nout of hollow rocks in ever-renewing waves\n\nand then fly in grape-like bunches over the spring\n\nflowers, some going this way, others going that\n\nway, so too did the troops march in formation\n\nfrom the ships and huts by the shore of the sea\n\nto the place of assembly. With them was\n\nRumor, messenger of Zeus, inciting them like\n\na blazing fire. The assembly was a riot of noise,\n\nthe earth groaning under the men as they sat,\n\nand nine heralds trying to halt the men’s cries\n\nso the Zeus-blessed king’s words could be heard.\n\nThe men eventually took their seats, and the noise\n\ndropped until all fell silent. Then Agamemnon\n\nstood and held the scepter forged by Hephaestus.\n\nHephaestus had given it to lord Zeus, Cronos’ son,\n\nwho gave it to the swift appearing messenger;\n\nthen Hermes gave it to Pelops, driver of chariots,\n\nand Pelops gave it to Atreus, shepherd of men.\n\nWhen Atreus died, it was given to Thyestes, rich\n\nin flocks, and Thyestes left it for Agamemnon\n\nto carry as he ruled many islands and all of Argos.\n\nHe leaned on the scepter and addressed the Argives:\n\n“Friends, heroes of Danaan, comrades of Ares,\n\ngreat Zeus, son of Cronos, has ensnared me\n\nin folly, for he promised me with a nod of assent\n\nthat I would sack great Ilios before going home,\n\nbut that was a foul trick, and now I must return\n\nto Argos in shame, having lost many men. Such\n\nare the pleasures of all-powerful Zeus, who has\n\nrazed many cities and will destroy many more,\n\nfor his strength is greatest of all. Those living\n\nin the days to come will learn of our shame,\n\nhow a vast and brave Achaean army fought\n\na fruitless battle against an outnumbered\n\nenemy in a war with no end in sight. If all\n\nAchaeans and Trojans were willing to swear\n\noath-offerings and number both sides, and if\n\nall Trojans were counted, and if all Achaeans\n\nwere arranged into troops of ten, and if each\n\ntroop took a Trojan to pour our wine, then many\n\ncompanies would be without a cup bearer.\n\nI tell you, this is how far the Achaeans outnumber\n\nthe Trojans who live in the city. But they have\n\nspear-wielding allies from many foreign cities\n\nwho fight me off, beat me back, and prevent\n\nme from sacking and pillaging crowded Ilios.\n\nNow nine years have passed for mighty Zeus.\n\nThe timber on our ships decays, our cables rot,\n\nand our wives and children all sit in the great halls\n\nwaiting for our return. Still, the task that brought\n\nus to this place still has not been accomplished.\n\nSo this is my commandment for all to obey:\n\nlet us sail back home to our beloved fatherlands,\n\nfor we shall never capture Troy’s wide streets.”\n\nSo he spoke, stirring the souls of those not\n\nprivy to the council’s plans. And the assembly\n\nmoved like the long waves of the Icarian sea,\n\nkindled by East and South Winds that swoop\n\ndown from the clouds of Father Zeus. Just as\n\nthe West Wind moves with a blustering rage\n\nover the deep standing corn, flattening the stalks,\n\nso also moved the assembly. As the men raced\n\nto their ships, their trampling feet lifted clouds\n\nof dust high into the air while calls rang out\n\nto fasten the ships and draw them into the sea.\n\nAnd as slipways were cleared and props removed,\n\nthe cries for home reached up to the heavens.\n\nAnd the Argives would have returned home before\n\ntheir fated time had Hera not said to Athena:\n\n“Alas, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, tireless one!\n\nIs this the way the Argives plan to flee over\n\nthe broad back of the sea to their fatherlands?\n\nAre they leaving Priam and the Trojans to claim\n\nas triumph Argive Helen, for whom so many\n\nAchaeans have perished in Troy, far from home?\n\nGo quickly through the Achaean army and use\n\nyour soothing voice to hold back each man\n\nand to stop them from dragging their ships to the sea.”\n\nSo saying, gleaming-eyed Athena obeyed,\n\nquickly rushing down from the Olympian peaks\n\nto the nimble Achaean ships. There she found\n\nOdysseus, Zeus’ equal in counsel, standing\n\nat rest. He had not yet fastened his benched\n\nships for his heart and soul were in pain.\n\nBright-eyed Athena stood near him and said:\n\n“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, wily Odysseus,\n\nis this how you plan to return to your fatherland,\n\njumping into your well-benched ships and fleeing?\n\nAre you leaving Priam and the Trojans to claim\n\nas triumph Argive Helen, for whom so many\n\nAchaeans have perished in Troy, far from home?\n\nGo quickly through the Achaean army and use\n\nyour soothing voice to hold back each man\n\nand to stop them from dragging their ships to the sea.”\n\nOdysseus recognized Athena’s voice and set off\n\nquickly, discarding his cloak, which was collected\n\nby his attendant, the herald of Ithaca, Eurybates.\n\nGoing straight to Agamemnon, son of Atreus,\n\nhe took from him his father’s imperishable scepter\n\nand headed for the bronze-clad Achaean ships.\n\nWhen he came upon a king or distinguished man,\n\nhe spoke to him with gentle words of restraint:\n\n“It is wrong to threaten you like a frightened fool,\n\nbut sit down and make your men sit as well;\n\nyou do not yet know the mind of Atreus’ son.\n\nHe tests us now, but soon he will start to punish.\n\nDid we not hear all he said during council?\n\nMay his anger not cause harm to Achaea’s sons.\n\nThe wrath of kings is great, for their honor comes\n\nfrom Zeus, and counsellor Zeus cherishes them.”\n\nWhen he saw a commoner who was shouting,\n\nhe struck the man with his staff and exclaimed:\n\n“Sit down, keep still, and listen to the words\n\nof braver men than you, for you are a worthless\n\ncoward, useless both in combat and in council.\n\nIt is impossible for every Achaean to rule as king;\n\ntoo many lords is a disaster. Let us have one leader,\n\none king, to whom the son of Cronos has granted\n\nthe scepter and the right to rule his people justly.”\n\nSo he expertly brought the army under control\n\nand they hurried noisily back to the place\n\nof assembly like a thundering wave that crashes\n\nonto a vast beach as deep waters rage below.\n\nAll sat down in their seats except for Thersites,\n\nthe blowhard whose disordered mind was filled\n\nwith foul words, whose speech was a rambling,\n\nreckless roar against kings, and whose only goal\n\nwas to win a laugh from the Argives. He was\n\nthe ugliest of all who came to Ilios: bow-legged,\n\nlame in one foot, shoulders bent, body hunched\n\nover, and a sugar-loaf head sparsely covered\n\nwith clumps of thin, wooly hair. He hated Achilles\n\nand Odysseus and often quarreled with them,\n\nbut now Agamemnon was the focus of his shrill\n\nshouts; and with him the Achaeans also held\n\nviolent anger and resentment in their hearts.\n\nWith a great cry, he confronted Agamemnon:\n\n“Son of Atreus, what is wrong? What do you\n\ncrave? Your tents are filled with bronze and many\n\ncaptured women, for we Achaeans grant you\n\nfirst choice whenever we sack a city. Or do you\n\ndesire gold, which some Trojan will bring\n\nout of Ilios to pay the ransom for a son who I\n\nor another Achaean bound and carried away?\n\nOr do you desire a young girl for your bed, one\n\nyou can hide away from others? It is a disgrace\n\nfor a lord to lead his troops into danger. So, all\n\nyou weak, despicable Achaean women, let us\n\nhead home in our ships, and leave this man\n\nhere so he can enjoy his prized toys in Troy.\n\nThen he will learn if he really does need our help,\n\nfor he dishonored Achilles, a greater man than he,\n\nby seizing the man’s prize and taking it away.\n\nLucky for you Achilles’ heart is not filled with bile;\n\notherwise, that insult would have been your last.”\n\nSo Thersites spoke his abuse to lord Agamemnon,\n\nbut godlike Odysseus quickly pounced on the man,\n\nglaring at him harshly and scolding him, saying:\n\n“You may be a clever speaker, Thersites,\n\nbut only a fool quarrels with a king by himself.\n\nI think you are the basest, most pathetic of all\n\nwho came with the sons of Atreus to Ilios.\n\nSo keep your mouth shut, say no more about\n\nkings, and quit looking for an easy way home.\n\nWe do not know how this business will end,\n\nif the Achaean sons will win or lose, live or die.\n\nBut here you sit, showering this leader of men,\n\nAgamemnon, with insults and abuse simply\n\nbecause the Danaans have granted him prizes.\n\nBut let me tell you what is going to happen now.\n\nIf I discover you acting like a fool one more time,\n\nthen may my head be ripped from my shoulders\n\nand let no man call me father of Telemachus\n\nif I do not grab you and strip off your clothes—\n\ncloak, tunic, and all—and leave you naked\n\nand ashamed; then I will beat you and kick you\n\nout of camp until you run crying to the swift ships.”\n\nSo saying, he took the golden scepter and beat\n\nThersites until a swollen, bloody bruise covered\n\nhis back and shoulders. Tears poured down\n\nas he doubled over in pain and fell, terrified,\n\nto the ground, trying in vain to dry his tears.\n\nThough troubled by the scene, the Achaeans\n\nstill laughed and turned to each other, saying:\n\n“Amazing! Odysseus has performed countless\n\ngood deeds, as a counselor and a strategist,\n\nbut this is by far his greatest gift to the Argives,\n\nputting this worthless, babbling fool in his place.\n\nTo be sure, he and his oversized ego are not likely\n\nto be back to challenge kings with violent words.”\n\nSo they said. Then Odysseus, sacker of cities,\n\nstood, scepter in hand, next to bright-eyed Athena\n\nwho, in the guise of a herald, ordered the Achaeans,\n\nfrom those nearby to those far away, to be silent\n\nand to listen to his words and consider his advice.\n\nWith noble intent he addressed the assembly:\n\n“Son of Atreus, my king, the Achaeans seem\n\nready to make you the most despicable man\n\nin the world and to break the promise made\n\nbefore our journey from Argos, land of horses:\n\nthat we not return home until we raze the walls\n\nand sack the city of Ilios. They act like children\n\nor old widows, whining to each other about\n\ngoing home. True, our troubles would make\n\nanyone wish for home, and anyone away\n\nfrom his wife for just a month is vexed, especially\n\nwhen wintry winds and stormy seas hold him\n\nback. But we have been here for nine years\n\nalready, and we are still here. I do not blame\n\nany Achaean for being impatient, but to remain\n\nso long and return home empty-handed would\n\nbe a shame. So be patient, friends, and wait\n\nuntil we find out if Calchas’ prophecies are\n\ntrue or not. We know the truth in our hearts,\n\nfor we all witnessed it, those that death has not\n\ntaken. It seems like only yesterday when we\n\ngathered at Aulis, preparing to bring death\n\nto Priam and Troy. We were standing around\n\na spring, preparing to offer a perfect hecatomb\n\nto the gods on a sacred altar near a plane-tree\n\nand a shining stream, when an omen appeared:\n\na terrifying blood-red serpent, sent to the light\n\nof day by Zeus himself, that quickly darted\n\naway from the altar and towards the plane-tree.\n\nThere, on a branch at the top of the tree,\n\nwe saw eight baby sparrows hiding in the leaves,\n\nand the mother who gave them life was the ninth.\n\nThen the serpent ate the pitiful creatures, and as\n\nthe mother flew around mourning her little ones,\n\nhe grabbed her by the wings and ate her as she\n\ncried. But once the creature had eaten the baby\n\nsparrows and their mother, wily counselor\n\nZeus turned him to stone, and we stood there,\n\nstruck dumb by these terrible omens. But Calchas\n\nwas quick to divine their meaning, saying to us:\n\n‘Why are long-haired Achaeans so silent? Great\n\ncounselor Zeus has given us a glimpse of the future\n\nthat will be long in coming but never forgotten.\n\nJust as the serpent devoured the sparrow’s babies,\n\neight in all, along with the mother, the ninth,\n\nso we shall wage war in Troy for that many years;\n\nthen, in the tenth, we will capture the city’s streets.’\n\nAnd just as Calchas said, now this has come to be.\n\nSo come, hold fast, all you well-greaved Achaeans,\n\nfor soon enough we will capture the city of Priam.”\n\nSo he spoke, and the Achaeans cheered heartily,\n\nthe noise echoing all around the ships as they\n\ncelebrated the words of godlike Odysseus.\n\nThen Nestor, horseman of Gerenia, spoke:\n\n“Look now, you are all debating like little\n\nchildren who care nothing for the work of war.\n\nWhat happened to our compacts and our oaths?\n\nWhy not throw in the fire our counsels, plans,\n\nwine-sealed vows, and handshakes sealed with trust?\n\nWe have been too long arguing with useless words,\n\nbut we are still unable to find any solutions. Son\n\nof Atreus, do not alter course. Hold to your will\n\nand maintain command of the Achaeans\n\nin battle. As for those few who disagree with us—\n\nlet them waste away. Their plan will amount\n\nto nothing, and they will leave for Argos before\n\nlearning if the vow made by aegis-bearing Zeus\n\nis a lie or not. For I say on the day the Argives\n\nboarded swift ships with weapons of destruction\n\nfor Troy, Cronos’ son nodded his head, sending\n\nlightning on our right and showing us favorable\n\nsigns. Therefore no one should be eager to return\n\nhome until each man has slept with a Trojan’s\n\nwife as payment for our fighting over Helen.\n\nBut if anyone desires to return home, then let him\n\ntry to take a well-benched black ship so he may\n\nmeet his death before the whole army. You, king,\n\nshould listen and follow my counsel, for the advice\n\nI offer will be difficult to dismiss: divide the men\n\ninto tribes and clans, Agamemnon, so clans aid\n\nother clans and tribes other tribes. Should you do\n\nthis and should the Achaeans obey, you will know\n\nwhich leaders and men are cowardly and which\n\nare brave, for each clan will fight for itself, and you\n\nwill know if it is heaven’s will that you not sack\n\nthe city or the cowardice and folly of your men.”\n\nWhen he finished, Agamemnon, lord of men, replied:\n\n“Again, old man, your words outshine all others.\n\nIf father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo granted me ten\n\ncounselors like Nestor from among the Achaeans,\n\nthen we would soon bend Priam’s city to our will,\n\nseize it with our hands, and raze it to the ground.\n\nInstead, aegis-bearing Zeus has given me sorrow,\n\nfruitless feuds, and futile arguments. Now Achilles\n\nand I are exchanging violent words over some\n\nyoung girl, and I was the first to become angry.\n\nBut if we ever united in purpose, then we would\n\nsend death to Troy without delay. Now let each\n\nman go to his meal and then prepare for battle.\n\nSharpen your spear, polish your shield, feed\n\nyour swift-footed horses, examine your chariot\n\non both sides, and get ready for a long, dreadful\n\nday of battle against a fierce foe. But be warned:\n\nno rest will come until darkness falls. Your chest\n\nwill be bathed in sweat from the large shield strap,\n\nyour hands will grow heavy holding your spear,\n\nand your horse will be foaming as it strains\n\nfrom the pull of your well-crafted chariot.\n\nBut if any man chooses to loiter by the curved\n\nships, far from the fighting, then his fate is sealed:\n\nhe will become a feast for dogs and crows.”\n\nSo he spoke, and the Argives roared like a wave\n\ncrashing against a cliff when the south wind blows,\n\na jutting crag shaped by countless surges formed\n\nby untold winds coming from all directions.\n\nThey stood and scattered to the ships, built fires\n\nby their tents, and ate their meals. Each man\n\nmade a sacrifice to his tribe’s immortal god,\n\nand all prayed for death to pass them over in battle.\n\nBut lord Agamemnon offered a fat, five-year-old\n\nbull as sacrifice to the mighty son of Cronos\n\nand summoned all the noble Achaean leaders.\n\nNestor was the first, followed by Idomeneus,\n\nthe two Ajaxes , the son of Tydeus, and finally\n\nOdysseus, Zeus’ equal in counsel. War-crier\n\nMenelaus came on his own accord for he knew\n\nwhat troubled his brother’s heart. They took up\n\nbarley grains and surrounded the bull as lord\n\nAgamemnon stood among them and prayed:\n\n“Great and glorious Zeus, lord of the black clouds,\n\ndo not let the sun fall and darkness descend\n\nuntil I reduce Priam’s palace to a smoldering\n\nruin, burn his gates to the ground, rip Hector’s\n\ntunic from his body, drive a sword through\n\nhis chest, and make his many comrades fall\n\nhead-first into the earth and bite the dust.”\n\nBut Zeus did not answer his prayer right away;\n\nhe accepted the sacrifices but intensified the war.\n\nOnce prayers had been said and barley thrown,\n\nthey drew back the head, slaughtered and skinned\n\nthe bull, cut out the thighs, enclosed them in fat,\n\nand finally placed raw meat upon them. They\n\nburned these over leafless billets, the entrails\n\nskewered on a spit and held over a blazing fire.\n\nWhen the thighs were burnt, they tasted the entrails.\n\nThen the rest was cut into pieces, put on spits,\n\nroasted carefully, and taken out of the fire.\n\nWhen the meal was ready, they feasted, and all\n\nwere satisfied in equal measure. After every\n\nman’s desire for food and drink was sated,\n\nNestor, horseman of Gerenia, was first to speak:\n\n“Son of Atreus, Agamemnon, noblest of kings,\n\nthe time for talking is over, for the task that Zeus\n\nhas put into our hands can be delayed no longer.\n\nSo let the heralds summon the bronze-clad\n\nAchaean soldiers to gather by the ships, and let\n\nus go as a group through the wide Achaean camp\n\nso we can quickly rouse the fierce god of war.”\n\nAgamemnon, ruler of men, heeded Nestor’s\n\nadvice and ordered the clear-voiced heralds\n\nto summon the long-haired Achaeans to battle;\n\nthe men, hearing the call, gathered quickly.\n\nThe kings near the Zeus-blessed son of Atreus\n\nmarshaled their troops, and golden-eyed Athena\n\nfollowed them holding the eternal aegis, covered\n\nwith a hundred tightly-woven tassels, each one\n\nmade of gold and worth a hundred oxen. She\n\nrushed through the Achaean army urging them\n\nforward, and within each man’s heart she placed\n\nthe might and vigor for a long and bitter battle.\n\nSoon blood-lust replaced their desire to go back\n\nto the hollowed ships and go home to their families.\n\nJust as a baneful fire burning up a boundless\n\nwoods on a mountain peak is visible from afar,\n\nso the shine from the marching sea of bronze soldiers\n\nwas so bright it could be seen from the heavens.\n\nAnd just as flocks of winged birds, geese, cranes,\n\nand long-necked swans fly here and there across\n\nthe meadows of Asia beside the river Cayster,\n\ndelighting in the power of their wings and uttering\n\ncries as they move from one perch to the next,\n\nso the many tribes streamed from the ships and camps\n\nto the plains of the Scamander as the earth shook\n\nin terror from the trampling feet and hooves.\n\nThey stood in the Scamander meadows in numbers\n\nas countless as the leaves and flowers of spring.\n\nAnd just as many swarms of flittering flies buzz\n\nabout the shepherds’ pens in springtime when\n\nthe buckets are overflowing with milk, so the hordes\n\nof long-haired Achaeans stood in the plain before\n\nthe Trojans, waiting anxiously to destroy them.\n\nAnd just as goat-herders easily separate scattered\n\ngoats when mingled together in the pasture,\n\nso the leaders marshaled their forces into formation\n\nfor the coming battle, including lord Agamemnon,\n\nhis eyes and head like Zeus who hurls thunderbolts,\n\nhis waist like Ares, and his chest like Poseidon.\n\nAnd just as a bull stands out among a herd of oxen\n\nwhen all are gathered together, so on this day\n\ndid Zeus ensure that the son of Atreus\n\nwould shine brighter than all other warriors.\n\nSpeak to me now, Muses who dwell on Olympus,\n\nfor you goddesses know and see all while we\n\nmortals know nothing and hear only rumors:\n\nwho were the lords and the leaders of the Danaans?\n\nFor I could not speak their numbers or names,\n\nnot even if I possessed ten tongues or ten mouths\n\nor a tireless voice or a heart made of bronze,\n\nunless the Olympian Muses, daughters of Zeus,\n\nsend to my mind all those who gathered in Ilios.\n\nNow I will describe the many ships and their leaders.\n\nThe Boeotians were led by Peneleos and Leitus,\n\nalong with Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius.\n\nThese men came from Hyria, rocky Aulis,\n\nSchoenus, Scolus, mountainous Eteonus, Thespeia,\n\nGraea, and the wide spaces of Mycalessus;\n\nthey dwelt in Harma, Eilesium, Erythrae,\n\nEleon, Hyle, Peteon, Ocalea, the well-built\n\ncitadel at Medeon, Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe,\n\nrefuge for wild doves; they ruled Coroneia\n\nand the grasses of Haliartus; they made\n\nhomes in the lands of Plataea, Glisas, the well-\n\nbuilt citadel of lower Thebes, and holy\n\nOnchestus, the splendid grove of Poseidon;\n\nand they lived in Arne of the rich vines, Mideia,\n\nsacred Nisa, and Anthedon by the sea shore.\n\nIn all, they set sail with fifty ships, each holding\n\none hundred and twenty young Boeotians.\n\nThose from Aspledon and Orchomenus\n\nof the Minyan were led by Ascalaphus and Ialmenus,\n\nsons of Ares. The revered maiden Astyoche\n\nbore him in secret for the god of war when she\n\nretreated to her chambers in the palace of Actor,\n\nson of Azeus. With them were thirty hollow ships.\n\nThe leaders of the Phocians were Schedius\n\nand Epistrophus, sons of Iphitus, great-hearted\n\nson of Naubolus. They ruled over Cyparissus,\n\nrocky Pytho, divine Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus;\n\nthey called Anemoreia and Hyampolis home\n\nand lived along the heavenly river Cephisus,\n\nwhere they held Lilaea beside the river’s springs.\n\nThey followed in a fleet of forty black ships,\n\nand they were marshaled into column formation\n\nand positioned to the left of the Boeotians.\n\nThe Locrians were led by Little Ajax, swift son\n\nof Oïleus, who was smaller than Telamonian Ajax,\n\nwore a tight tunic of linen, and was the greatest\n\nspearman among all Panhellenes and Achaeans.\n\nHe led the men from Cynus, Opoeis, Calliarus,\n\nBessa, Scarphe, the lovely Augeiae, Tarphe,\n\nand Thronium on either side of the Boagrius river.\n\nLittle Ajax led forty black ships full of Locrians,\n\nwho lived across the straits from holy Euboia.\n\nThe fire breathing Abantes occupied Euboia,\n\nCalchis, Eretria, vine-rich Histiaea, Cerinthus\n\nby the sea, and the steep-walled city of Dion;\n\nthey also lived in Carystus and held Styra.\n\nElephenor was their leader, companion of Ares,\n\nson of Chalcodon, and lord of the great-hearted\n\nAbantes. Following him were the swift Abantes,\n\nwearing their hair long in the back and wielding\n\nashen spears able to shatter enemy breastplates.\n\nIn all, Elephenor commanded forty black ships.\n\nThose who dwelt in Athens—the well-built citadel\n\nand home of great-hearted Erechtheus, who\n\nwas born of the grain-giving earth but nurtured\n\nby Athena, daughter of Zeus, in her own rich\n\ntemple in Athens, where each year young men\n\nsought to win his favor through the sacrifice\n\nof a bull or ram—were led by Menestheus, son\n\nof Peteos, who had no equal in commanding\n\nchariots and shield-bearing warriors. Only\n\nNestor challenged him in this, being his elder.\n\nThe Athenians followed their leader in fifty ships.\n\nAjax led twelve ships from Salamis, who were\n\nstationed with the Athenian battalions in battle.\n\nAnd those who held Argos, high-walled Tiryns,\n\nHermione, Asine that occupies a deep bay,\n\nTroezen, Eionae, vine-rich Epidarus, and the sons\n\nof the Achaeans who held Aegina and Mases\n\nwere led by the skilled battle-crier Diomedes\n\nand Sthenelus, prized son of famed Capaneus.\n\nA third came with them: Euryalus, godlike son\n\nof King Mecisteus, who was the son of Talaus.\n\nBut the leader was the skilled battle-crier\n\nDiomedes, who led a fleet of eighty black ships.\n\nThose who held the well-built citadel at Mycenae,\n\nwealthy Corinth, and the well-built Cleonae;\n\nand those who lived in Orneae, pleasant Araethyrea\n\nand Sicyon, where Adrastus was first made king;\n\nand those with homes in Hyperesia, Gonoessa\n\non a steep cliff, and Pellene; and those around\n\nAegium, Aegialus, and wide Helice were led\n\nby the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, who\n\ncommanded one hundred ships and the largest\n\narmy with the bravest soldiers and proudly wore\n\ngleaming gold, for he distinguished himself above\n\nall other warriors both in nobility and in leadership.\n\nThose who held hollow, rifted Lacedaemon,\n\nPharis, Sparta, and Messe, the haunt of doves;\n\nand those from Bryseae and lovely Augeiae;\n\nand those from Amyclae and Helos, citadel\n\nby the sea, Laas, and Oetylus were led by great\n\nwar-crier Menelaus, who commanded sixty\n\nships, arming them apart from the others.\n\nHe went among them with great confidence,\n\nurging them to battle, for he was most anxious\n\nto avenge all of Helen’s fighting and groaning\n\nThen came those who inhabited Pylos, fair Arene,\n\nThryum, the ford of Alpheius, well-built Aepy,\n\nCyparisseis, Amphigeneia, Pteleos, Helos,\n\nand Dorium, where the Muses met the Thracian\n\nThamyris and stopped his singing as he traveled\n\nfrom the house of Eurytus in Oechalia for he\n\nboasted of winning the daughter of Zeus even\n\nif the Muses themselves sang against him.\n\nIn their anger, they maimed him, silencing his sweet\n\nvoice and preventing him from playing the lyre.\n\nThey were led by horseman Nestor of Gerenia,\n\nand with him were ninety ships lined up in rows.\n\nThose holding Arcadia under steep Mount Cyllene,\n\nby the barrow of Aerytus, where warriors fight\n\nhand-to-hand; and those from Pheneos, sheep-rich\n\nOrchomenus, Rhipe, Stratia, and windy Enispe;\n\nand those in Tegea, charming Mantineia,\n\nStymphalus, and Parrhasia were led by the son\n\nof Ancaeus, King Agapenor, with sixty ships,\n\neach one filled with many Arcadian warriors,\n\nall highly skilled in combat. As they had no\n\ninterest in seafaring, Agamemnon, son of Atreus\n\nand king of men, provided them well-benched\n\nships so they could cross the wine-dark sea.\n\nAnd those who dwelt in Buprasium and famed\n\nElis, from the lands of Hyrmine and Myrsinus\n\nby the sea to the rock of Olen and Alesium,\n\nhad four leaders. Each leader was followed by ten\n\nships, and each ship was filled with Epeian fighters.\n\nTwo were led by Amphimachus and Thalpius:\n\none the son of Cteatus, the other of Eurytus;\n\nanother was led by Diores, son of Amarynceus;\n\nand the fourth was led by Polyxeinus, son\n\nof King Agasthenes and grandson of Augeias.\n\nThen those from Dulichium and the holy islands\n\nof the Echinae, who dwell across the sea from Elis,\n\nwere led into battle by Meges, equal to Ares\n\nand son of the horseman Phyleus, dear to Zeus,\n\nwho long before, enraged at his father, went to live\n\nin Dulichium. With Meges followed forty black ships.\n\nAnd Odysseus led the great-hearted Cephallenians\n\nwho dwelt in Ithaca and windy-wooded Neritum,\n\nalong with those who lived in Crocyleia and rugged\n\nAegilips, those holding Zacynthus and the area\n\nnear Samos, and those on the mainland opposite\n\nthe isles. They were led by Odysseus, equal\n\nto Zeus in counsel, on twelve ships with red prows.\n\nAnd the Aetolians who lived in Pleuron, Olenus,\n\nPylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon\n\nwere led by Thoas, son of Andraemon, for the sons\n\nof great-hearted Oeneus were gone, as was the king\n\nhimself, and yellow-haired Meleager was also dead.\n\nThus, the burden of rule over all Aetolians passed\n\nto him. He led a contingent of forty black ships.\n\nIdomeneus, the great spearman, led the Cretans,\n\nwho dwelt in Cnossos, Gortyn with its high walls,\n\nLyctus, Miletus, the white cliffs of Lycastus,\n\nthe cheerful cities of Phaistos and Rhytium, and all\n\nothers who lived among the thousand cities of Crete.\n\nTheir leaders were Idomeneus, expert spearman,\n\nand Meriones, equal of Enyalius, slayer of men.\n\nTogether, they led eighty black ships to Troy.\n\nTlepolemus, son of Heracles, a large and lanky\n\nman, led nine ships out of Rhodes, all filled\n\nwith lordly Rhodians who divided into three\n\ngroups: Lindos, Ialysus, and Cameirus with its\n\nwhite cliffs. Spear-famed Tlepolemus was born\n\nto mighty Heracles by Astyocheia. Heracles\n\ntook her out of Ephyra by the Selleïs river\n\nafter sacking the city and slaying many warriors.\n\nWhen Tlepolemus came of age in his father’s\n\npalace, he killed Licymnius, his father’s beloved\n\nuncle a child of Ares who had already grown old;\n\nhe quickly built ships, gathered a large band,\n\nand escaped across the sea, for mighty Heracles’\n\nsons and grandsons had threatened him. After\n\nmuch weary wandering, he arrived at Rhodes\n\nwhere his people settled into three distinct tribes.\n\nZeus, master of men, favored them, and he\n\nrained a river of riches down upon them.\n\nNireus led three balanced ships out of Syme.\n\nThe son of Aglaïa and King Charopus, Nireus\n\nwas the second most handsome man among\n\nthe Danaans after the noble son of Peleus.\n\nBut he was powerless, and few men followed him.\n\nThose who dwelt in Nisyrus, Carpathus, Casus,\n\nCos, Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands\n\nwere led by Pheidippus and Antiphus,\n\nsons of King Thessalus, son of Heracles.\n\nWith them there sailed thirty hollowed ships.\n\nAnd all those who dwelt in Pelasgian Argos,\n\nAlus, Alope, Trachis, Phthia, and Hellas,\n\nland of fair women, and who were called\n\nMyrmidons and Hellenes and Achaeans,\n\nwere commanded by Achilles, who led fifty ships.\n\nBut they were not concerned with waging war,\n\nsince there was no one to lead them into the ranks.\n\nSwift-footed Achilles was idling by his ships,\n\nenraged because of the fair-haired girl Briseïs,\n\nwhom he won after the sacking of Lyrnessus\n\nand the Theban walls, and after striking down\n\nthe spear-fighters Mynes and Epistrophus, sons\n\nof King Evenus, who was the son of Selepus. He\n\nwas idle in grief for her, but soon he would rise up.\n\nAnd those who dwelt in Phylace, flowery Pyraus,\n\nthe sacred fields of Demeter, mother of sheep\n\nIton, Antron by the sea, and the grassy banks\n\nof Pteleos were once led by warlike Protesilaus,\n\nbut the black earth had long since covered him.\n\nHe left a grieving wife in Phylace and a house\n\nhalf-finished when he was killed by a Dardanian\n\nafter being the first Achaean to leap from the ships.\n\nThough the men missed their leader, they were not\n\nleaderless. Podarces, scion of Ares, took charge,\n\nthe son of Iphiclus Phylacus, and the younger,\n\nfull-blood brother of great-hearted Protesilaus.\n\nStill, warlike Protesilaus was older than his brother\n\nand a better warrior. Thus, while the men had\n\na leader, they mourned the great man they lost.\n\nAnd with Podarces there sailed forty black ships.\n\nThe eleven ships of those who lived in Pherae\n\nbeside Boebeïs lake and in Boebe, Glaphyrae,\n\nand well-built Iolcus were led by the beloved\n\nson of Admetus, Eumelus, born to Admetus\n\nby Alcestis, Pelias’ most beautiful daughter.\n\nAnd those who lived in Methone, Thaumacia,\n\nMeliboea, and rocky Olizon were led\n\nby the famed archer Philoctetes. On each\n\nof their seven ships were fifty rowers, and each\n\nrower was an expert archer in battle. However,\n\nPhiloctetes lay in overwhelming pain on the holy\n\nisland of Lemnos, where the Achaean sons left\n\nhim in great grief after a bad bite from a deadly\n\nwater snake. But the Argives would soon\n\nremember King Philoctetes. Though the men\n\nmissed their king, they were not without a leader,\n\nfor Medon marshaled them, the bastard son\n\nof Oïleus, whom Rhene bore to the pillager.\n\nAnd those who held Tricca, craggy Ithome,\n\nand Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus,\n\nwere led by the two sons of Asclepius,\n\nthe skilled healers Podaleirius and Machaon.\n\nAlong with them sailed thirty hollowed ships.\n\nAnd those who held Ormenium, the springs\n\nof Hypereia, Asterium, and the white peaks\n\nof Titanus were led by Eurypylus, dear son\n\nof Euaemon. With him sailed forty black ships.\n\nAnd those who held Argissa and Gyrtone,\n\nOrthe, Elone, and Oloösson, the city of white,\n\nwere led by Polypoetes, staunch in the fight,\n\nthe son of Peirithous, son of Zeus. Glorious\n\nHippodameia conceived him to Peirithous\n\non the day he exacted revenge from the hairy\n\ncentaurs, forcing them out of Pelion and driving\n\nthem to Aethices. He led with Leonteus, scion\n\nof Ares, son of great-hearted Coronus who was\n\nCaeneus’ son. With them sailed forty black ships.\n\nAnd Gouneus led twenty two ships from Cyphus,\n\nfilled with the Enienes and the Peraebi, staunch\n\nfighters who built their homes in wintry Dodona\n\nand in the fields around charming Titaressus,\n\nthe sweet stream that pours into the Peneius\n\nbut never merges with those crystal-clear waters;\n\ninstead, it floats over them like olive oil, for it is\n\na branch of the Styx, the terrible river of oaths.\n\nAnd speedy Prothous, son of Tenthredon,\n\nwas the leader of the Magnetes, who dwelt\n\naround Peneius and leaf-covered Pelion.\n\nWith Prothous there followed forty black ships.\n\nThese were the leaders and kings of the Danaans.\n\nBut tell me, Muse, who were the best warriors\n\nand the best horses among the sons of Atreus?\n\nThe best horses were those driven by Eumelus,\n\ngrandson of Pheres: swift as birds, matching\n\nin color, and equal in age and in height. Apollo\n\nof the silver bow reared them in Pereia, a pair\n\nof mares fueled by the fierce panic of war.\n\nThe bravest warrior was Telamonian Ajax—\n\nso long as Achilles raged, for Peleus’ noble son\n\nand the horses that drove him were by far the best.\n\nBut he sat among his crooked, sea-cleaving\n\nships, enraged at Agamemnon, son of Atreus.\n\nHis men by the sea shore amused themselves\n\nwith the discus, the javelin, and the bow;\n\ntheir horses stood idle, eating cloves and celery\n\nfrom the marshy ground; and the chariots\n\nwere covered in the tents of their masters.\n\nThe men, longing for their Ares-blessed leader,\n\nwandered around the camp but did not fight.\n\nSo they advanced as if the earth was consumed\n\nin fire, and the land groaned as when Zeus, hurler\n\nof thunder, lashes out in anger at the land around\n\nTyphoeus in Arimoi, where the creature sleeps.\n\nAnd the earth roared beneath their feet as they\n\nmarched along, moving quickly over the plain.\n\nWind-swift Iris, messenger for aegis-bearing Zeus,\n\ncame to the Trojans with a grievous message.\n\nA general assembly of Trojans, both young\n\nand old, had gathered at Priam’s gate. Swift Iris\n\nstood nearby and addressed them, disguising\n\nher voice to sound like Polites, the son of Priam\n\nwho was Troy’s trusted lookout, posted atop\n\nthe barrow of old Aesyetes where he watched\n\nfor the Achaeans to move from their ships.\n\nIn his guise, swift-footed Iris said to them:\n\n“Old man, you always enjoy endless debate,\n\nbut now endless war has sprung up. I have\n\nengaged in countless battles between warriors,\n\nbut I have never before seen an army this size:\n\nas many feet charging over the plains to the city\n\nas there are leaves or grains of sand on a shore.\n\nHector, there are many allies all over Priam’s\n\ncity, but they speak different tongues and come\n\nfrom different lands, so let each chief order\n\nthe men from his tribe to assemble and then\n\nlead them out of the city and into battle.”\n\nHector heeded the goddess’ words and quickly\n\ndismissed the assembly to take up arms. Then\n\nthe gates were opened, and with a rumbling\n\nroar the army marched out, on foot and on horse.\n\nIn front of the city, there is a steep hill far off\n\nin the distance with a clear space all around it.\n\nThe men call this hill Batieia, but the gods call\n\nit the grave-mound of Myrine, the leaper; this is\n\nwhere the Trojans and their allies marshaled forces.\n\nThe Trojan leader was gleaming-helmed Hector,\n\nson of Priam; his army was by far the largest\n\nand the best, each man eager to wield the sword.\n\nThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, son\n\nof Anchises, whom Aphrodite conceived when\n\nshe lay with the mortal at the spur of mount Ida.\n\nHe was aided by Antenor’s two sons, Archelochus\n\nand Acamas, both skilled in all manner of fighting.\n\nThe Troes, who dwelt in Zeleia at the lowest foot\n\nof Ida, were wealthy men who drank the dark water\n\nof Aesepus and were led by the son of Lycaon,\n\nPandarus, who was given a bow by Apollo himself.\n\nThose holding Adrasteia and the land of Apaesus,\n\nand those in Pityeia and steep Mount Tereia\n\nwere led by Adrastus and Amphius who wore\n\na tight tunic made of linen, sons of the soothsayer\n\nMerops of Percote who would not allow his sons\n\nto join in war’s destruction, but they did not obey\n\nhim, for the black god of death drove their minds.\n\nAnd those living around Percote and Practius\n\nand those who held Sestus, Abydus, and rich\n\nArisbe were led by Hyrtacus’ son Asius, ruler\n\nof men, who came from Arisbe and the river\n\nSelleïs, borne by his massive, chestnut horses.\n\nAnd the eager spearmen of the Pelasgi tribes,\n\nwho dwelt in fertile Larisa, were led by Hippothous\n\nand his brother Pylaeus, child of Ares, sons\n\nof Pelasgian Lethus, the son of Teutamus.\n\nAcamas and the hero Peirous led the Thracians\n\nwho lived near the strong waters of the Hellespont.\n\nAnd Euphemus, son Troezenus, cherished\n\nby Zeus, led the Ciconian spearmen.\n\nPyraechmes led the Paeonians of the curved bows,\n\nfrom far off Amydon by the wide-flowing Axius\n\nwhose waters were the most beautiful on earth.\n\nThe Paphlagonians were led by brave-hearted\n\nPylaemenes from Eneti, land of wild mules.\n\nThey held Cytorus, the area around Sesamus,\n\nand the grand homes by the Parthenius river\n\nin Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erythini.\n\nOdius and Epistrophus led the Halizones\n\nfrom far off Alybe, the birthplace of silver.\n\nAnd the leaders of the Mysians were Chromis\n\nand Ennomus, the soothsayer, who could not\n\nprevent his black fate: to be killed in the river\n\nby swift-footed Achilles, along with other Trojans.\n\nAnd the Phrygians from far off Ascania were led\n\nby the battle-ready Phorcys and godlike Ascanius.\n\nThe Maeonians from the foot of mount Tmolus\n\nwere led by Mesthles and Antiphus, sons\n\nof Talaemenes and the nymph of the Gygaean lake.\n\nAnd Nastes led the barbarous tongued Carians,\n\nwho held Miletus, the densely forested mountains\n\nof Phthires, the rivers of Maeander, and the high\n\npeaks of Mycale. Their leaders were Amphimachus\n\nand Nastes, the glorious sons of Nomion. Foolish\n\nNastes came to the battle dressed all in gold like\n\na little girl, but it could not protect him from death,\n\nfor he was killed in the river at the hands of swift-\n\nfooted Achilles, and Achilles claimed the gold."
