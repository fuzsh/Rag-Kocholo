        "text": "Thersander\n\n9817 Thersander, a Trojan asteroid associated with Jupiter, was discovered on September 24, 1960, by C.J. Van Houten, Ingrid Van Houten-Groeneveld, and Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory near at Pauma Valley, California. It has a period of 12 years, 78 days.\n\nThersander was named for a son of Polynices, one of the two sons of Oedipus who fought over the throne of Thebes in one of Greek mythology's most important episodes, the Seven Against Thebes.\n\nAfter Polynices and his brother Eteocles killed one another, and the Epigoni(Those Born Afterward), the sons of the seven Captains who stormed Thebes on Polynices' behalf against Eteocles, captured Thebes, Thersander became its king.\n\nThersander later fought in the Trojan War, bringing forty ships full of warriors to Troy along with Diomedes. Vergil says Thersander was one of the warriors who crawled into the Trojan Horse.\n\nAndrei Sakharov and Yelena Bonner, who took on the Soviet Union...and won.\n\nAstrologically, Thersander indicates fighting for justice for onself and/or others, claiming what is rightfully one's own, exacting justice revenge for oneself or another, taking one's turn at something, turning the tables, reversals, conquests, triumphs.\n\nAlex Haley, who, unlike many black Americans descended from slaves, was lucky enough to be able to trace his ancestry back to Africa, had his Thersander conjunct the Moon(and Philoctetes), and also opposite Chariklo, square Ceres, Hidalgo and Jansky, trine Demokritos and Volta, and semisextile Asbolus. His book Roots, the story of how he chased down family lore to find his African ancestors, mercilessly described the horrors of slavery and introduced mainstream America to genealogy, hitherto the province of the rich and titled. Amelia Earhart, a pioneering aviator in defiance of sexism, also had Thersander prominent(on the Descendant); it squared her Sun, opposed her Pallas, trined her Damocles and Jansky, and sesquiquadrated her Part of Fortune.\n\nMuhammad Ali has Thersander in the second house, conjunct Thersites(another TTrojan asteroid named for a Greek warrior who was a notorious nasty picky critic); trine Saturn, Pallas, Pholus, Chariklo and Skepticus; quincunx Hylonome and Venus; sextile Mallory; square Vesta, and parallel Chiron. He refused to kowtow to white people in the 1960s; rejected his \"white\" birth name, Cassius Clay; embraced Islam, which may very well have been the religion of his African ancestors, as it was Alex Haley's Gambian forebear Kunta Kinte; and was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title after refusing to serve in the military during the Vietnam War as a protest against racial injustice.\n\nCesar Chavez\n\nAstrologer Jeane Dixon, who helped restore astrology to respectability in the West, had Thersander square the Midheaven and Saturn, trine the Sun, opposite Pallas, Symmetria and Tutenchamun, conjunct Thersites, trine Tara, Stephengould, Hidalgo and Pholus, and sextile Heracles. George W. Bush, who managed to succeed as president Bill Clinton, the man who defeated his father George W. Bush for re-election in 1992, has Thersander out of bounds, square the MC and Heracles, sesquiquadrate Mars, conjunct Pholus, quincunx Don Quixote and trine Weaver.\n\nThe glyph for Thersander is my own conception."
