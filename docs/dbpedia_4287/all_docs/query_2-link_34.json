This document provides an analysis of the character of Thersites in Homer's Iliad. It summarizes that Thersites has traditionally received a negative portrayal as an insolent troublemaker. However, the document argues that within the context of the Iliad alone, Thersites' role was to emphasize the established order against which Achilles' wrath is enacted. Specifically, it notes that Thersites is portrayed as physically ugly and of unknown ancestry to highlight how unlike a hero he is. His criticism of leaders is seen as inappropriate due to his lack of decorum, rather than his act of speaking out. The document aims to explain Thersites solely through his role in the dramatic situation at the start of the Iliad",
