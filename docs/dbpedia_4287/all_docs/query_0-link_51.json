As a result, Greek institutions and investors used ancient monuments to create the necessary infrastructure for the emerging tourist movement. The Greek monarchy actively participated in this modernization process by engaging in cultural experiences, which aimed to transform Greek heritage into a desirable tourist product for the western camp during the Cold War period. The Greek monarchy was at the centre of this sociocultural development engaging with the nationalist reflexes of Greek society. By embracing the discourse of ethnikofrosyni (‘national mindedness’), King Paul of Greece (1947–64) and Queen Frederica provided royal sanction for the nationalist uses of classical antiquities and Greece as a lieu de mémoire that could offer an exceptional experience to visitors. To strengthen these assertions, Paul assumed the role of the archaeologist and tour guide, showcasing the cosmopolitan allure Greek antiquities radiated and presenting Greece as a fashionable and appealing tourist destination. This article argues that the Greek monarchs’ intervention in the archaeological excavations at Mycenae (1952), as well as the royal cruise around Greek islands and monuments (1954) reflected the sociopolitical developments of the period and the monarchs’ engagement with the country’s cultural affairs.",
