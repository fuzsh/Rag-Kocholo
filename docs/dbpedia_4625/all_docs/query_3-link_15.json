        "text": "AUTHOR: Ferrellgas\n\nFinding out what size propane tank you need may seem like a tall order, but it doesn’t have to be. Our nationwide team of experts can help you identify which tank allows you to get the most out of your propane. A great place to start is with our propane tank size chart — check it out below.\n\nWhat propane tank size is right for you?\n\nWhen picking the best tank size for your needs, you’ll want to ask yourself these three questions:\n\nWhat will you use your propane for?\n\nYou wouldn’t use the same 20-lb tank that powers your grill to heat your home, so knowing what you need propane for is a great place to start identifying the right size.\n\nWhere would you like your propane tank to be located?\n\nAll propane tanks must be stored outdoors, but some large tanks can be installed underground. If you’re interested in underground storage, a trusted propane professional can confirm your property’s eligibility. Wherever you place your tank, just remember: practicing safe storage is a must.\n\nWhat size is your home or business, and how many propane-powered appliances do you have?\n\nLarger properties with many propane-powered appliances require larger tanks. Some may even require more than one. A 500-gallon tank should do the job for most households, but your propane professional can help you narrow down which tank size will best fit your needs.\n\nLarge propane tank sizes for your home or business:\n\nYou’ll find plenty of options to choose from when it comes to large propane tanks. If you’re feeling unsure about your decision, give your local Ferrellgas office a call for guidance. In the meantime, here’s a quick breakdown of tanks ranging from 120 gallons to 1,000 gallons:\n\n120-gallon propane tank size:\n\nCapacity: Holds 96 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions: 54.5” height and 30” in diameter\n\nUses: A standard 120-gallon propane tank is primarily designed for homes or businesses that are only running 1-2 appliances on propane, including hot water heaters, fireplaces, home appliances, or space heaters. Other uses might include powering a range or clothes dryer if there aren’t any additional propane-powered appliances in the home.\n\n250-gallon propane tank size:\n\nCapacity: Holds 200 gallons of propane.\n\n\\Dimensions: 7’10” long and 30” in diameter\n\nUses: Designed for moderate propane uses, a 250-gallon horizontal propane tank can support appliances such as a clothes dryer, fireplace, and stove, and is sufficient for a heating system for modest-sized homes.\n\n325-gallon propane tank size:\n\nCapacity: Holds 260 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions: 10’ long and 30” in diameter\n\nUses: A compromise between the 250-gallon and 500-gallon tanks, the 325-gallon propane tank is the perfect fuel source for backup generators or some smaller homes that use less than 500 gallons of propane per year.\n\n500-gallon propane tank size:\n\nCapacity: Holds 400 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions: 9’11” long and 37.5” in diameter\n\nUses: The standard size for most households, a 500-gallon tank is perfect for powering central heating, appliances, and even small commercial projects.\n\n1,000-gallon propane tank size:\n\nCapacity: Holds 800 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions: 16’1.5” long and 41” in diameter\n\nUses: Generally reserved for large industrial and commercial projects, 1,000-gallon tanks also work well for larger homes.\n\n1,990-gallon propane tank size:\n\nCapacity: Holds 1,592 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions: 23’11” long and 46.5” in diameter\n\nUses: Most commonly used for commercial heating but can also be used for very large households or filling stations for large fleets.\n\n30,000-gallon propane tank size:\n\nCapacity: Holds 24,000 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions: 70’ long and 10’ tall\n\nUses: Ideal for large commercial properties, large communities with metered service, bulk plant storage, or a fill-up station for fleets that require frequent refills.\n\nSmall propane tank sizes for your home or business\n\nSmall propane tanks also come in a variety of sizes. Here's a brief overview of tanks ranging from 20 to 100 pounds:\n\nRV propane tank sizes:\n\nThere are two types of RV propane tanks: permanent ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) and removable DOT (Department of Transportation) tanks. Here are the most common sizes, their capacity, and dimensions:\n\nCapacity:\n\n20-lb: Holds up to 4.7 gallons of propane.\n\n30-lb: Holds 7 gallons of propane.\n\n33-lb: Holds 8 gallons of propane.\n\n100-lb: Holds 23 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions:\n\n20-lb: 18” in height and 12.5” in diameter\n\n30-lb: 24” in height and 12.5” in diameter\n\n33-lb: 26.75” in height and 12.5” in diameter\n\n100-lb: 48” in height and 14.7” in diameter\n\nUses: From keeping your fridge and hot water running, to powering your furnace and stove burners, RV propane tanks are essential for fueling your RV.\n\nPortable Grill Tanks:\n\nCapacity:\n\n20-lb: Holds up to 4.7 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions:\n\n20-lb: 1' 6\" in height and 1' in diameter\n\nUses: Portable grill tanks are the perfect, convenient propane source for backyard or portable grills.\n\nForklift Propane Tanks:\n\nCapacity:\n\n33-lb: Holds 7.4 gallons of propane.\n\n43-lb: Holds 10 gallons of propane.\n\nDimensions:\n\n33-lb: 29″ in height and 13″ in diameter\n\n43-lb: 33” in height and 12.5” in diameter\n\nUses: Propane forklifts are commonly used in warehouses, construction, and agricultural industries.\n\nPropane tank installation: where should you place it?\n\nWhen you rent a propane tank from Ferrellgas, it will most likely be placed aboveground. Underground tanks are generally owned by the customer, rather than rented. There are plenty of benefits to both above and below ground tanks. Let’s take a look at the benefits of each:\n\nAbove-ground propane tank benefits:\n\nBuilt to endure harsh weather and elements\n\nEasy to maintain and service\n\nDoes not require a lot of digging into your yard. A line that runs underground from your tank to your home will still be required.\n\nUnderground propane tank benefits:\n\nDoesn’t take up valuable space in your yard\n\nQuick installation process done by a Ferrellgas expert\n\nTo determine which type of tank best fits your needs, please speak with one of our Customer Service Professionals for more information.\n\nPropane tank maintenance\n\nPropane tank maintenance is crucial to ensure safe and efficient operations and should always be handled by a propane professional. When you schedule routine inspections and follow proper storage protocol, you can extend the lifespan of your tank and keep your propane system running smoothly.\n\nWhy isn’t my propane tank full after a refill?\n\nIt’s important to know that your tank will never be filled 100% for safety reasons, but it will be filled to its maximum capacity. Much like water, propane expands when heated. Empty space inside the tank gives the propane space to expand and contract while maintaining the tank’s integrity. For most tanks, the maximum capacity is around 80%. So, if you have a 500-gallon propane tank in your yard, it can safely hold up to 400 gallons of propane.\n\nHow long should my propane tank last before I need a refill?\n\nYour propane use has the biggest influence on your refill timeline, and use is influenced by several factors including the number of propane-powered appliances in your home, their efficiency, where you live, and what season it is.\n\nFor instance, look at two houses on the same block; they’re roughly the same size with similar energy use throughout the year, and each relies on a 500-gallon propane tank. However, one is well-insulated with efficient appliances, while the other has less-efficient appliances and poor insulation. There’s a good chance that the first home can go a little longer between refills.\n\nTo accurately determine when how often you’ll need to refill your propane tank, we recommend turning to a propane professional like Ferrellgas.\n\nHow to check your propane tank level:\n\nWhether you want to monitor your propane tank’s level manually or digitally, you’ve got options."
