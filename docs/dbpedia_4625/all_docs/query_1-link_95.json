In 2002 we started our timid steps in the field of shop renovations and we started to provide to our customers unique services for their new business. In a few years we could offer them full renovation of their business and at the same time competitive marketing, advertising and IT solutions. With our experience we could help them properly to set up or design their products and guide them to reach their goals.\n\nOn the other hand, due to our structure and the existing partnerships, we have been able to provide additional construction and promotional services by designing and constructing unique exhibition stands for our customers. In 2006, along with the above, we have fully entered into the field of constructions, technical projects and GIS projects. Besides renovation services we are also involved in undertaking technical studies for public and private sectors. At the same time we never stop providing our unique IT services.\n\nIn 2009 we undertook some difficult e-learning projects that gave us extra experience in the field of on-line educational services.\n\nOur experience upon all these different business fields gave us the ability to see things differently, to do things out of the box and to have innovative ideas in different fields.\n\nSupport our project that will help all children of the world.\n\nWe expect your support!\n\nRead more at our projectâ€™s website.\n\nwww.uulapp.com"
