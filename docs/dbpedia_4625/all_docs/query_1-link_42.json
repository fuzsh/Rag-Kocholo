        "text": "As we transition into our new electronic device policy, we remind our parents/guardians to be mindful of attempting to call or text students during classes when students should not have phones or other messaging devices with them. In the event of a family emergency, families should contact the school office to relay a message to their student. To improve our communication process, we have added a live telephone operator during school hours to assist families.\n\nLPHS has approved a new electronic device policy for the coming school year.\n\nThe policy will begin on the first day of the 2024-2025 school year, August 9, 2024.\n\nOur goal is to limit educational distractions by banning personal electronic devices (cell phones, smart watches, earbuds/headphones, gaming devices, etc.) from all classrooms as well as spaces where privacy is expected (locker rooms & bathrooms)."
