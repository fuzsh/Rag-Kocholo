        "text": "Carrier Free\n\nWhat does CF mean?\n\nCF stands for Carrier Free (CF). We typically add Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a carrier protein to our recombinant proteins. Adding a carrier protein enhances protein stability, increases shelf-life, and allows the recombinant protein to be stored at a more dilute concentration. The carrier free version does not contain BSA.\n\nWhat formulation is right for me?\n\nIn general, we advise purchasing the recombinant protein with BSA for use in cell or tissue culture, or as an ELISA standard. In contrast, the carrier free protein is recommended for applications, in which the presence of BSA could interfere.\n\nU-212\n\nFormulation Supplied as a solution in MES. Shipping The product is shipped with dry ice or equivalent. Upon receipt, store it immediately at the temperature recommended below. Stability & Storage: Use a manual defrost freezer and avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n\n6 months from date of receipt, -70 °C as supplied.\n\n3 months, -70 °C under sterile conditions after opening.\n\nBackground: Ubiquitin\n\nUbiquitin is a 76 amino acid (aa) protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic organisms. Ubiquitin is highly conserved with 96% aa sequence identity shared between human and yeast Ubiquitin, and 100% aa sequence identity shared between human and mouse Ubiquitin (1). In mammals, four Ubiquitin genes encode for two Ubiquitin-ribosomal fusion proteins and two poly-Ubiquitin proteins. Cleavage of the Ubiquitin precursors by deubiquitinating enzymes gives rise to identical Ubiquitin monomers each with a predicted molecular weight of 8.6 kDa. Conjugation of Ubiquitin to target proteins involves the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of Ubiquitin and a lysine residue in the target protein. This process of conjugation, referred to as ubiquitination or ubiquitylation, is a multi-step process that requires three enzymes: a Ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzyme, a Ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme, and a Ubiquitin ligase (E3). Ubiquitination is classically recognized as a mechanism to target proteins for degradation and as a result, Ubiquitin was originally named ATP-dependent Proteolysis Factor 1 (APF-1) (2,3). In addition to protein degradation, ubiquitination has been shown to mediate a variety of biological processes such as signal transduction, endocytosis, and post-endocytic sorting (4-7).\n\nThis N-terminal HA-tagged Ubiquitin is a potent, irreversible and specific inhibitor of most deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) including Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) and Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). Useful for inhibiting the hydrolysis of poly-Ubiquitin chains on substrate proteins in vitro and thus enhances poly-Ubiquitin chain accumulation.\n\nSharp, P.M. & W.-H. Li. (1987) Trends Ecol.
