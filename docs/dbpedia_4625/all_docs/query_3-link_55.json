        "text": "Propane is used for a wide range of applications due to its cost-effectiveness, high energy output, and versatility. It's commonly employed for heating homes and businesses, as well as powering appliances such as stoves, water heaters, fireplaces, outdoor heaters, pools and power generators and more. Learn more about propane uses.\n\nPropane also supports multiple commercial and industrial needs, being an efficient energy solution for businesses in hospitality and restaurant industries for heating, cooking, back up power and more. Propane is also well known for its industrial applications in sectors such as mining, construction, and agriculture, where it powers tools and machinery, fuels forklifts and fleets with auto propane, and provides heating and drying for crops. Additionally, propane warms large spaces and construction sites and generates power for these environments. This showcases propane's versatility and efficiency as an energy source for a wide range of uses. Explore propane’s commercial applications for your business.\n\nWhether you use propane for heating, cooking, power generation, among other applications, choosing the right propane tank size depends on your needs, including the size of your home if used for heating, the area where you are located, which and how many appliances you're fueling, etc. For residential setups, our experts will guide you in selecting the ideal tank size based on your household's propane usage and will install the correct tank size to ensure your home’s energy needs are satisfied. Discover the most common residential tank sizes here.\n\nSimilarly, for commercial purposes, our team will assess your business's propane needs, considering how and where you'll use propane, to recommend the appropriate tank size and amount of tanks your business will require to power its operations. Explore the most common commercial propane tank sizes here.\n\nPropane is odourless, but an odorant called ethyl mercaptan is added to give it a distinct and easily detectable odour. This odour resembles \"rotten eggs” to help identify propane leaks for safety reasons.\n\nIn emergency situations or if you suspect a propane leak, be sure you know how to safely shut off your propane supply. To do this, locate the service shut-off valve under the dome or lid on top of your tank. Turn the valve clockwise as far as possible to turn off the supply. It's a simple step that can keep you safe during an emergency.\n\nIf you ever suspect a propane leak, characterized by a \"rotten egg\" smell due to the added odorant ethyl mercaptan, evacuate the area immediately and contact Customer Service at 1-87SUPERIOR (1-877-873-7467) for immediate assistance.\n\nLearn more about propane safety tips."
