        "text": "Note: To calculate the actual amount of luxury vinyl flooring required you should make an allowance for the wastage that occurs during fitting. For example, smaller rooms and odd shaped rooms tend to have a higher proportion of wastage. Examples of wastage rates are indicated above.\n\nThese rates are guidelines only. Rather than risk ordering more than you need, you may prefer to order the lower amount and then order an extra pack only if it’s needed, as we don’t accept the return of part orders – just remember to keep your original batch number and don’t leave it too long between orders. Please contact us if you require any further help or information."
