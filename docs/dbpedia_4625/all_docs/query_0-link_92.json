        "text": "Joni Mitchell has announced Joni Mitchell Archives, Vol. 4: The Asylum Years (1976-1980), the latest installment of her archival release series. Today, along with the announcement, she released the single, a live cut of “Coyote.”\n\nArriving on October 4th via Rhino Records, The Asylum Years (1976-1980) will span an era of Mitchell’s career in which she experimented with jazz-folk fusion, releasing 1976’s Hejira, 1977’s Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter, her 1979 collaboration with Charles Mingus (titled Minugs), her 1980 live album Shadows and Light, and more. The collection will feature unreleased studio sessions, alternate versions, numerous live recordings, and more.\n\nGet Joni Mitchell Tickets Here\n\nThe Asylum Years (1976-1980) will be available on 6xCD and 4xLP formats, and will arrive with a 36-page book featuring photographs and an “extensive conversation” between Mitchell and Cameron Crowe, in which she shares “intimate anecdotes, memories, and stories” from the five-year period. Check out the artwork and tracklist for the vinyl release below.\n\nRelated Video\n\nOn the technical side, the audio for the new release is sourced from “original stereo reels, nagra film recordings, multi-track tapes, radio airchecks, cassettes and more.” Pre-orders are ongoing.\n\nArriving today as the album’s lead single is a live track, “Intro to Coyote / Coyote,” recorded at the Montreal stop of Bob Dylan’s “Rolling Thunder Revue” tour. Stream the song below.\n\nMitchell’s previous archival box sets have included Vol 1: The Early Years (1963-1967); Vol. 2: The Reprise Years (1968-1971); and Vol. 3: The Asylum Years (1972-1975).\n\nThe announcement of The Asylum Years (1976-1980) comes after a triumphant year for Mitchell, who memorably stole the show with a masterful performance at the 2024 Grammys. That night, she also accepted the Grammy for Best Folk Album for her live album, Joni Mitchell At Newport. This October, she will perform two nights at The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles (get tickets here).\n\nJoni Mitchell Archives, Vol. 4: The Asylum Years (1976-1980) Artwork:\n\nJoni Mitchell Archives, Vol. 4: The Asylum Years (1976-1980) Tracklist:\n\nLP1\n\nSide One — Rolling Thunder Revue\n\n01.
