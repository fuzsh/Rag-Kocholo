Comes pre-backed and floats.\n\nGlue down: Purchase enough glue to cover the entire area.\n\nPeel-and-stick: Glue is recommended for long-lasting and secure placement.\n\nClick lock without backing: Buy an underlayment the size of the area of your project.\n\nVinyl Plank Flooring Sizes\n\nVinyl planks come in two standard lengths: 36 inches and 48 inches. Widths range from 4 inches to 12 inches wide, though most are 6 to 9 inches wide.\n\nHow many boxes of vinyl plank flooring do I need?\n\nMost cases cover from 18 to 25 square feet. The number in each box varies depending on width. Once you’ve decided on the style you want:\n\nFind the area you want covered.\n\nDivide that by how many square feet the carton covers.\n\nAdd 10% for waste and round up.\n\nYour final number is how many cartons you want to purchase.\n\nSheet Vinyl Calculator\n\nSheet vinyl comes in rolls. It comes in both lay-flat and glue-down varieties. You can also choose from multiple thicknesses. To find how much you need, follow these steps:\n\nMeasure the length and width of the area you’re covering.\n\nUse the calculator above or multiply the two manually.\n\nAdd 20% for waste and overage.\n\nRound up to the nearest whole foot.\n\nVinyl Flooring Roll Lengths\n\nThere are no standard vinyl roll lengths. If the flooring store doesn’t have enough, they can order any length directly from the factory or supplier.\n\nVinyl Flooring Roll Widths\n\nVinyl rolls come in two very specific widths for residential projects: 12 feet and 13.2 feet. Some light commercial grades come in 4- and 6-foot widths.\n\nHow to Measure for Vinyl Flooring\n\nFor any type of vinyl flooring, you’ll need to find the area of your project. Follow these steps:\n\nFind the area. Length times width. For oddly shaped rooms, break it up into smaller square or rectangular areas.\n\nAdd 10%-20% for waste.\n\nRound up to the nearest whole foot.\n\nFor sheets of flooring: take this number to your local store or professional installer.\n\nFor plank floors: take this number and divide it by the coverage listed on the case of your chosen brand. Round up to the nearest whole number. This is how many cases you’ll need.\n\nFor example: Measuring a home with 2 rooms, one 10’x12’ and one 10’x20’.\n\nArea = 10×12 = 120 and 10×20 = 200\n\n120 + 200 = 320 square feet.\n\n320 x 10% = 320 x 1.10 = 352\n\nFor sheet flooring, stop here. You’ll need at least 352 square feet of sheet vinyl.\n\nBecause you’ll likely find it in 12-foot-wide rolls, you’ll purchase a roll of 12 feet by 32 feet. That’s 10 feet long for one room plus 20 feet long for the other room with 2 feet extra for waste.\n\nTotal you’ll actually purchase: 384 square feet.\n\nFor plank floors, divide by the case coverage. We’ll use the example of a case covering 20 square feet: 352 / 20 = 17.6\n\nRound up to 18. This is how many cases you’ll need.\n\nTips on Measuring for a Vinyl Floor\n\nA few tips for measuring your project:\n\nFor sheets: add a few inches or round up the nearest foot. This helps walls that are warped or aren’t square. You can always trim a little off. Adding thin strips creates seams.\n\nMeasure under trim. That can add up to an extra inch on each side.\n\nFor plank in kitchens: measure the widest areas and then subtract the cabinet area for planks.\n\nLinoleum Calculator\n\nYou’ll calculate linoleum flooring just like you would for sheet vinyl. Follow these steps:\n\nCalculate the area of the room by multiplying the width times the length.\n\nAdd 10%-20% for overage and waste from cutting.\n\nRound up to the nearest foot.\n\nInstalling linoleum costs $2 to $5 per square foot to purchase and install. Unlike vinyl, it’s made of natural materials, like cork, minerals, linseed oil and resin. While this might make some brands more environmentally friendly, it also means it’ll break down quicker.\n\nVinyl Calculator by Room Size\n\nRoom Size Sq. ft. of Plank Sq.

This leaves a seam or worse, you’ll have to buy a new length and start over.\n\nBubbling and peeling. Common to DIY installs, improper surface prep and not enough adhesive lead to premature failure.\n\nIf you want to go the DIY route, try click-together luxury plank floors. However, you may end up going through an extra case or two. Also, plan to spend at least a weekend on the project. If you don’t have the time, consider hiring a vinyl flooring installer near you.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow much extra vinyl flooring do I need?\n\nFor planks, you’ll need an extra 10% to cover waste.

Typically, you’ll pay $18 to $45 to have a professional purchase and install a square yard.\n\nDoes sheet vinyl flooring thickness matter?\n\nVinyl flooring thickness matters for both durability and feel. Thicker floors have a more cushioned feel to them and typically have a thicker wear layer.\n\nWhat are typical measurements for wide width vinyl flooring?\n\nWidth vinyl plank floors typically come in 8- and 9-inch widths, though a few brands offer widths up to 12 inches.\n\nHow many vinyl tiles do I need for a floor?\n\nHow many tiles you’ll need depends on the area of your floor and the size of the tiles you’re using.
