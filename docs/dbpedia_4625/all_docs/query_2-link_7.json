        "text": "NGL partners with the State of New Mexico to secure approximately 10,000 acres of Lesser Prairie Chicken habitat\n\nDepartment of Game and Fish reveals new property purchase in Southeast New Mexico\n\nSANTA FE – On Thursday, September 23 the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish was joined by members of the State Game Commission; representatives of NGL Energy Partners, LP; Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Secretary Sarah Cottrell Propst; and members of the public to cut the ribbon on a property, recently purchased for the purpose of enhancing wildlife conservation including the Lesser Prairie Chicken, grassland birds and pronghorn antelope and grassland habitats.\n\nThe acquisition of the Pipkin Ranch, located about 40 miles southeast of Fort Sumner, NM was made possible through a public-private partnership between the State of New Mexico and NGL Energy Partners. This purchase of 7,500 acres connects two previously owned Department properties, resulting in the creation of a large-scale connectivity project of over 10,000 acres for New Mexico wildlife.\n\nGame and Fish Director Mike Sloane said, “this willing public-private partnership is an example of the positive work that can occur when we all recognize the value of conservation. I am excited to have been a part of this effort and believe that it will stand as an example going forward as we begin to implement the 30 x 30 initiative recently advanced by the Governor.”\n\nGame Commission Chairwoman Sharon Salazar Hickey sad, “purchasing and maintaining property such as this ranch provide a great example of conserving wildlife alongside wind energy development.” She added, “to the average eye, the Pipkin Ranch might look like rolling grassland with little value; but to the Lesser Prairie Chicken it is a chance for growth – an important conservation stronghold!”\n\nThe Lesser Prairie Chicken is an iconic American grouse species that has been considered for federal listing through the Endangered Species Act. The Lesser Prairie Chicken tends to occupy native grasslands and prairies. One of the primary causes for concern for the Lesser Prairie Chicken is loss of habitat. It is estimated that 90% of the species habitat has diminished across their historical range.\n\nNGL Energy Partners, LP is a diversified, publicly traded, mid-stream energy and infrastructure company, with the bulk of its New Mexico operations focused on the management of oil and gas waste water. NGL selflessly stepped in to facilitate this purchase – ensuring that this property, with it’s known multiple Lesser Prairie Chicken leks, would be added to the State’s conservation portfolio.\n\nMatthias Sayer, on behalf of NGL Energy Partners said, “it was organic and natural to engage with Game and Fish, and talk about overlapping interests in the conservation of game and non-game wildlife species.”\n\nThis public-private partnership came about just days before Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s 30 x 30 initiative was issued.\n\nSayer quoted from Governor Lujan Grisham’s executive order Protecting New Mexico’s Land, Watersheds, Wildlife and Natural Heritage, “voluntary practices implemented by land managers, including private landowners and leaseholders, on working lands (both private and public) provide opportunities to support broader restoration activities, improve watershed health, create resilience in rural and urban communities, add value to the food chain and food security, and contribute to the state’s outdoor recreation and eco-tourism economy, [agencies] shall review and utilize existing authorities, funding and programs within their respective Departments or Offices to support and implement programs designed to conserve, protect and enhance lands and natural environments across the State, coordinate with external stakeholders to the maximum extent practicable, enhance biodiversity, preserve landscapes with the potential to increase water yields or infiltration, wildlife habitat and promote healthy soils and watersheds and finally to ensure movement across the landscape.” Sayer continued, “That is exactly what has been done here today and we are happy to be a part of it.”"
