This allows you to achieve some of the most vibrant and realistic effects of any flooring material. The drawback to this technology is that vinyl flooring is only as strong as the wear layer over the design, and both can wear through over time. Old vinyl tends to have shabby worn spots where it has worn through to the PVC core layer.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nLinoleum, on the other hand, is a solid, colorfast material in which the color and pattern are not just printed on the surface but are dimensionally present through the entire thickness of the material. This limits the design options to some degree, but it also means that the flooring can age without showing significant wear for many years. Old linoleum still has the same color and pattern as the day it was installed.\n\nBest for Appearance: Vinyl\n\nVinyl flooring offers more design variety than linoleum.\n\nWater and Heat Resistance\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nMost modern vinyl is virtually waterproof and can be installed in frequently damp environments, including basements and other below-grade areas. Older types of vinyl use felt as the backing layer, which can be susceptible to water damage. Newer vinyl uses fiberglass backing, which is entirely immune to water and damage. Sheet vinyl is more water-resistant than vinyl tiling because it has fewer seams that can allow water through to the underlayment.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nAlthough it is water-resistant, linoleum is not impervious to damage from moisture and it needs to be sealed periodically to protect it against liquid penetration. If flooding occurs, a linoleum installation can be ruined, and excessive humidity can sometimes cause individual tiles or the corners of sheets to curl.\n\nOf the two materials, linoleum has better heat resistance. Hot skillets or curling irons do not generally melt linoleum immediately, as they do with vinyl flooring. And linoleum does not readily burn and emit toxic fumes in a house fire, as vinyl does.\n\nBest for Water and Heat Resistance: Vinyl Flooring\n\nVinyl flooring is more impervious to water than linoleum, which needs to be regularly sealed. However, be aware that linoleum is somewhat more resistant to damage from heat.\n\nCare and Cleaning\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nVinyl is one of the easiest floors to keep clean. You can sweep and vacuum vinyl regularly, or mop it with any of a variety of detergents without having to worry about the material discoloring. Resistant to moisture, mold, and mildew, vinyl can be simply wiped clean periodically to keep it looking its best.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nLinoleum is nearly as easy to care for as vinyl, which is why it has long been a favorite flooring for schools, hospitals, and other public properties. Just sweep and or vacuum it periodically. Stains can be hand-cleaned with a rag and a mild detergent. Manufacturers recommend using a cleaning solution made for linoleum, since off-the-shelf detergents may have high pH levels that can damage the surface.\n\nBest for Care and Cleaning: Tie\n\nBoth vinyl and linoleum flooring are equally easy to clean.\n\nDurability and Maintenance\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nBecause vinyl flooring is constructed with a design layer adhered over a solid PVC layer, there is the potential for the design layer to wear through, exposing the solid core layer. Modern vinyl flooring has a very tough protective wear layer, so no waxing or sealing is ever necessary.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nLinoleum is considered the more durable flooring material, thanks to the construction that features solid material through the thickness of the flooring. Both types of flooring are fairly easy to maintain, but unlike vinyl flooring, linoleum requires periodic sealing to keep it resistant to moisture and stains. Linoleum is a slightly softer material than vinyl, and it can be more easily scratched and gouged. Small damage is somewhat less evident, though, since there is no core layer to show through.\n\nBest for Durability and Maintenance: Tie\n\nLinoleum is the more durable material, but vinyl is easier to maintain since it never requires sealing.\n\nInstallation\n\nBoth linoleum and vinyl flooring require a very smooth and flat underlayment, since they are thin, flexible materials that allow flaws in the underlayment to telegraph through to the surface.\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nSheet vinyl flooring is usually installed with a full glue-down application, and installation is somewhat awkward for DIYers. Cutting large sheets to a precise fit is difficult, as is joining the seams between pieces. Because professional installation is rather cheap, most people opt for this method. Vinyl tiles, on the other hand, are quite easy to install, making them a favorite among DIYers.\n\nVinyl tiles can be installed with a full glue-down bond, but most forms of vinyl tile now sold at home improvement centers are peel-and-stick, in which the adhesive has already been applied to the tiles; you simply peel away the protective backing paper when its time to install the tiles.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nInstalling linoleum can be very similar to installing vinyl, but sheet linoleum can be even harder to work with than sheet vinyl; it is almost always installed by professionals. Sheets are somewhat tougher to cut than vinyl, but a sharp linoleum knife usually works. The sheets are applied with a glue-down bond, and seams are welded together. Linoleum also comes in tiles and planks that are easier for DIY installation; they may use a \"click-lock\" joining method that allows the tiles or planks to float over the subfloor without any adhesives, much the way that luxury vinyl or laminate planks are installed.\n\nBest for Installation: Vinyl Flooring\n\nVinyl flooring is a softer, more pliable flooring material, making it easier to work with.\n\nCost\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nSheet vinyl flooring purchased at big box home improvement centers typically costs $.50 to $2 per square foot, while tiles sell for an average of $3.50 per square foot. Much higher costs are possible for designer styles sold at specialty flooring stores.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nLinoleum flooring is a somewhat more expensive material, with sheet material generally costing $5 to $7 per square foot, and tiles averaging about $3 to $5 per square foot. Again, higher costs are possible with designer styles.\n\nBest for Cost: Vinyl Flooring\n\nVinyl flooring is less expensive than linoleum. For either material, you can plan on adding about as much as $4 to $7 per square foot for professional installation.\n\nLifespan\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nThe cost difference between vinyl and linoleum is offset to some degree by their relative life expectancies. While vinyl costs less than linoleum, it will last only between 10 and 20 years. But vinyl flooring tends to maintain its glossy appearance right up until the top layers suddenly wear through, exposing the core.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nA linoleum floor can last 20 to 40 years or more. But linoleum will show its age over time, weathering away and gradually looking older and older until it needs to be replaced. Some people like the patina of an aging linoleum floor; others dislike it.\n\nBest for Lifespan: Linoleum Flooring\n\nFor sheer longevity, linoleum has a much better performance than vinyl flooring.\n\nSizes\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nVinyl sheet flooring is typically available in 6- or 12-foot rolls, from which lengths are cut according to need. Tiles are sold as squares 9 to 18 inches across.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nSheet linoleum is also available in 6- or 12-foot rolls. Linoleum planks are typically similar to luxury vinyl planks in size, 48 to 60 inches long, and 4 to 8 inches wide.\n\nBest for Size: Tie\n\nNeither flooring material has an advantage when it comes to size.\n\nResale Value\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nVinyl flooring is usually recognized as an economy flooring material; it normally adds little to no real estate value to a home.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nFew prospective homebuyers can tell the difference between vinyl and linoleum flooring at a glance, although linoleum may be viewed a little less favorably from pure design standpoint since it does not have the variety of colors and patterns found in vinyl flooring. However, the green nature of linoleum may be seen as a selling point if it is pointed out to homebuyers who have good environmental awareness.\n\nBest for Resale Value: Tie\n\nBoth materials are regarded as economy flooring materials, and neither normally offers a significant advantage when it comes to resale value over other flooring options such as hardwoods.\n\nComfort and Sound\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nAlthough resilient enough to prevent some dishes from breaking if they drop onto it, vinyl flooring is a fairly cold and hard material underfoot, especially when installed over a concrete subfloor. Vinyl flooring is slightly less noisy than a hard material like ceramic tile or laminate.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nLinoleum is a slightly softer material that may have more resilience underfoot.\n\nBest for Comfort and Sound: Linoleum\n\nAs a slightly softer material, linoleum flooring will be slightly more comfortable and quieter underfoot than vinyl flooring.\n\nEnvironmental Considerations\n\nVinyl Flooring\n\nThere are few building materials in the world more inherently toxic than vinyl. While the various toxic, carcinogenic chemicals that go into the manufacture of vinyl are largely stable when transformed into sheets or tiles for flooring, these chemicals are released when burned, and vinyl flooring has no option for recycling when old materials are removed. These materials remain in landfills for centuries, and disposal through burning is really not an option.\n\nLinoleum Flooring\n\nA very key difference—and one that makes all the difference in the world to some homeowners—is the \"green\" nature of linoleum. Linoleum could not be a more different material from vinyl. Its primary ingredient is plant-based linseed oil, which is mixed with other natural materials. Rather than potentially have to tear it out and replace in as little as 10 years, you may well get 40 years of life from a linoleum floor, and when you do finally get rid of it, the component materials break down harmlessly in the environment.\n\nBest for Environmental Considerations: Linoleum Flooring\n\nHere, the hands-down winner is linoleum flooring, since it is made from entirely natural materials, compared to the toxic chemicals that go into the manufacture of vinyl flooring.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nBoth vinyl and linoleum flooring have merits as relatively low-cost flooring materials where an easy-to-clean clean, water-resistant surface is desired. Vinyl has the advantage for diversity of design and low cost, while linoleum will wear longer and is a much more natural, less toxic material.\n\nTop Brands\n\nSeveral of the major brands that manufacture vinyl flooring also offer linoleum flooring. Other companies specialize in linoleum only."
