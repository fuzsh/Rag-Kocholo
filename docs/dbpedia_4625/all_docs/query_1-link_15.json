        "text": "Lerotholi Polytechnic (LP) is an autonomous public institution established in 1905. It is governed by the Lerotholi Polytechnic Act of 1997 and offers both Crafts and Technician programmes. It has grown from about 50 students in 1905 to around 3000 currently. The institution comprises four schools, namely, the School of Engineering and Technology (SET) and the School of the Built Environment (SOBE) which offer certificates in craft programs and diplomas in engineering. The School of Enterprise and Management (SEM) offers certificates in Textiles and diplomas in commercial programmes. The School of Continuing Education (SOCE) on the other hand focuses on increasing access to education by offering specific need-based programs and courses to industry and the general public while also using available opportunities to generate income for the institution.\n\nLP also has a vibrant administrative department which supports the academic function of the institution. This multi-disciplinary nature puts the Polytechnic in a unique position to meet the multi-faceted needs of industries and developmental needs of the country at large. LP has over the years cultivated and sustained a good relationship with industry which does not only sponsor students in many ways ranging from industrial attachment, but also offers awards to students with outstanding performance and also employs LP graduates."
