Below is a breakdown of your installation costs.\n\nBy Room Size\n\nYour room’s size is perhaps the biggest cost factor, with prices ranging from $250 to $4,600 per room. A small, 100-square-foot room will fall on the low end of the price range, while a room exceeding 350 square feet may cost more than the average highest cost.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the cost to install vinyl planks by room size:\n\nFLOOR SIZE IN SQUARE FEET AVERAGE COST 100\n\n$250 – $1,300\n\n150\n\n$375 – $2,000\n\n200\n\n$500 – $2,600\n\n250\n\n$625 – $3,300\n\n300\n\n$750 – $3,900\n\n350\n\n$850 – $4,600\n\nBy Type\n\nThe type of vinyl flooring you choose could impact the cost of your project by as much as $0.50 to $4.50 per square foot. Sheet vinyl flooring is a low-cost type of flooring, while luxury vinyl planks tend to cost the most. Below is a comparison of the different vinyl flooring types and their prices.\n\nRigid Vinyl Plank Flooring\n\nYou’ll pay somewhere between $1 and $4 per square foot for standard rigid vinyl plank flooring or $3 to $11 with installation. Vinyl planks look like wood flooring, however they’re more cost-friendly and waterproof.\n\nLuxury Vinyl Plank Flooring\n\nLuxury vinyl plank (LVP) flooring costs $2 to $5 per square foot on average for the materials and $4 to $13 per square foot with labor. These planks cost slightly more than standard rigid vinyl planks because they tend to be thicker and softer.\n\nLuxury Vinyl Tile\n\nThe cost of luxury vinyl tile (LVL) flooring falls between $1 and $5 per square foot for materials or $3 to $13 per square foot installed. These tiles mimic the look of real tiles but feel softer underfoot and tend to cost less.\n\nSheet Vinyl\n\nSheet vinyl flooring costs around $0.50 to $1.50 per square foot for the material or $2.50 to $8.50 per square foot installed. These large sheets are one of the most affordable types of vinyl flooring, making them an economical flooring choice for those on a budget.\n\nTYPE INSTALLATION COST PER SQUARE FOOT MATERIAL COST AVERAGE TOTAL COST PER SQUARE FOOT\n\nRigid vinyl planks\n\n$2 – $7\n\n$1 – $4\n\n$3 – $11\n\nLuxury vinyl planks\n\n$2 – $7\n\n$2 – $5\n\n$4 – $13\n\nLuxury vinyl tile\n\n$2 – $7\n\n$1 – $5\n\n$3 – $13\n\nSheet vinyl\n\n$2 – $7\n\n$0.50 – $1.50\n\n$2.50 – $8.50\n\nBy Installation Method\n\nThere are three installation methods for installing vinyl flooring: peel-and-stick, interlocking and glue-down. Let’s break down each method and its associated costs.\n\nINSTALLATION METHOD AVERAGE COST PER SQUARE FOOT\n\nPeel-and-stick\n\n$3 – $13\n\nInterlocking or floating\n\n$3 – $13\n\nGlue-down\n\n$2.50 – $13\n\nPeel-and-Stick Vinyl Flooring\n\nPeel-and-stick vinyl costs between $3 to $13 per square foot installed. This option requires a meticulous hand, but it saves you on additional costs like glue because the planks come with an attached adhesive backing.\n\nInterlocking/Floating Vinyl Flooring\n\nThe cost of interlocking vinyl flooring falls between $3 and $13 per square foot. Interlocking vinyl floors have a click-and-lock system that links them together. You don’t need glue to secure these planks, making them more affordable to install.\n\nAt the same time, you’ll likely spend more on the vinyl flooring itself as it’s typically a higher-quality vinyl plank or luxury vinyl plank material.\n\nGlue-Down Vinyl Flooring\n\nGlue-down vinyl flooring costs between $2.50 and $13 on average per square foot. Though costs are slightly lower, you also have to factor in the cost of glue. This method is also time-consuming, more permanent and it may fall on the higher end of labor costs. Sheet vinyl and some rigid vinyl planks and tiles use the glue-down method to secure the material to the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

We do not present information about every offer available. The information and savings numbers depicted above are for demonstration purposes only, and your results may vary.\n\nUsing your home's equity is an easy way to fund your new floors!\n\nGet prequalified in minutes by clicking on your state.\n\nLearn More\n\nTo help you further break down the cost of your vinyl flooring, here are some additional costs that can affect the price of your project.\n\nLabor\n\nInstalling flooring costs between $2 and $7 per square foot on average. Labor prices vary depending on your region’s cost of living, the extent of the project and the installation method. It’s a good idea to check with local flooring installation companies and gather several quotes to get the most competitive price on the market.\n\nMaterials\n\nThe quality of your materials can double the cost in some cases. Remember, vinyl flooring contains several sheets of material, and the material makeup of your flooring can play a large role in the cost of the vinyl.\n\nHigh-quality inlaid vinyl flooring costs significantly more than printed vinyl flooring. Most sheet and peel-and-stick vinyl have printed flooring designs, whereas luxury vinyl flooring contains inlaid color granules for a more realistic look.\n\nInstallation Location\n\nIf you’re installing vinyl on stairs, small spaces or other hard-to-reach areas, anticipate paying more in labor costs to accommodate extra cuts and adhering materials.\n\nRemoving Old Floors\n\nRemoving old floors costs around $1 to $4 per square foot on average. How much your flooring removal costs depends on the type of flooring. For example, you could pay significantly more to remove tile, which can cost up to $6 per square foot.\n\nUnderlayment\n\nThe cost of new floor underlayment rolls is $40 to $80 per 100 square feet. Underlayment helps keep your flooring quiet, comfortable and level."
