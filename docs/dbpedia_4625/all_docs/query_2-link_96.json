RCA cables out of the amp to a plug that matches the Line In on your sound card.\n\n• You capture the sound either as one big wav file for the whole side and then split them later, or record each track separately.\n\n• Process the wavs to clean them up.\n\n• Rip them to MP3 or your codec of choice.\n\nYou can capture WAVs with EAC using the Tools, Record Wav option. You can also capture them with CDex. A good freeware editor is Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net). You could use either EAC or CDex to rip the finished wavs to MP3.\n\nYou may have to mess around with the Sound Settings in Windows (sometimes the Line In will be muted by default, that sort of thing). Unless your vinyl is very clean, expect to spend lots of time playing with the editor. Keep a copy of the original wav and edit with a copy. If you're incredibly anal about removing ticks and pops, you can spend ages cleaning it up. Personally, I can live with a little bit of noise. You can easily over-process a file and make it mud.

I will just point out that the most important step in transferring LP to digital is the initial analogue playback. The LPs need to be as clean as you can get them, and the turntable/arm/cartridge need to be in good condition and set up correctly. No amount of digital post-processing can make up for deficiencies at this stage.\n\nRecording to hard disk is straightforward, and can be done with free software (Audacity, Wave Repair in \"freeware mode\", EAC's recording function, etc). Trimming unwanted bits and fading can be done with Audacity, which is an excellent audio editor.\n\nBut if you want to do *restoration*, I'm not aware of any free options - you'll have to spend a bit of money. I thank Andy for mentioning Wave Repair. Other inexpensive restoration software I recommend you try out would be Wave Corrector (I consider it to be probably the best affordable automatic declicker at present), Groove Mechanic, and Click Repair. For lots more money, Adobe Audition does a fine job, as does Sony's Noise Reduction 2.0 DX plug-in in combination with a suitable DX-compatible editor (eg. Sound Forge).\n\nFinally, be prepared for a fairly hefty learning curve.

Of, course there is the issue of snap, crackle, and pop that I am trying to solve. Are you saying that \"Wave Corrector\" would be better for a beginner than \"Wave Repair\" for restoration purposes?\n\nHefty learning curve is right! I have spend hours on just one album and fully realize that at 58 I would die before I finished recording all my albums I did find myself trying to get every last click out of the one song I was working on, but am ready to give up on that!\n\nI did not clean the vinyl with anything other than a soft lint free cloth.

I have been capturing wav files with EAC and the problem I am having is trying to figure out which editor to use for getting rid of the snap, crackle and pop without turning the file into \"mud\" as you stated. I started with EAC and it worked pretty good but left a some noise uncorrected. I then tried Nero Wave Editor 3, which sounded pretty darn good but when I tried to load the edited wav file into my MusicMatch player, it would not load. I can open the file with Nero Show Time, but I want to be able to open the Wave file with any player, or Cd player. It is a shame to have a purchased wave editor and not be able to use it, but Nero support is not very good.\n\nSo, I have some homework to do with all the suggested editors. Thank you for the tip to work only on copies of the wav files! I did not think of that when I was doing my testing and messed up my recording and have to start all over again with the recording.\n\nThanks again,\n\ngene\n\nHow to record a vinyl LP to hard drive\n\nReply #14 – 2006-08-12 22:00:35\n\nI believe cleaning with water isn't the best of ideas because when it dries it can stick small particles like dust to the plastic that were loose before.\n\nHow to record a vinyl LP to hard drive\n\nReply #15 – 2006-08-12 23:40:39\n\nI believe cleaning with water isn't the best of ideas because when it dries it can stick small particles like dust to the plastic that were loose before.\n\nSo should I just vacum the record before recording or is there a recommended solution to apply?

Gets a lot of junk off of dusty or dirty records and styluses. IIRC, after records went out of vogue, DiscWasher started pushing snake-oil junk (to include colored rings that you stick on CDs), and now I don't see them around anymore. Got what they deserved. For what it's worth.\n\nA few ounces of fluid can last for years.\n\nMy gut reaction is that DISTILLED water, as one poster said above, and a carefully chosen cloth or brush that won't scratch the records, should be fine. Whatever you use, brush or wipe parellel with the grooves (the opposite of what you should do with CDs).\n\nI believe cleaning with water isn't the best of ideas because when it dries it can stick small particles like dust to the plastic that were loose before.\n\nSo should I just vacum the record before recording or is there a recommended solution to apply?

There have been many threads on cleaning techniques and cleaning solutions, some, I'm sure, on this forum. For a description of a very good basic technique, there is a page on this site\n\nhttp://discdoc.com/\n\nWhile oriented towards selling those particular products, the technique works quite well with many less expensive solutions and brushes.\n\nVacuuming, to remove fluids, is very good but definitely don't dry vacuum. Also, you need a proper LP to vacuum cleaner interface. There are several that work but none come standard with any home vacuum cleaner.\n\nWaveRepair is quite labor intensive. I doubt it is possible to find another program that can give you better results -- if you are willing to put in the time and effort to use it properly -- but other programs can produce good results with less work. Those I work with, and thus the ones I know, are more expensive than your indicated budget. I can't say whether decent results are possible with those whose prices are in between WaveRepair and my own choices.\n\nA standard working technique is to save every major change, when cleaning and repairing, with a new name so that you can go back a step anytime you need to.\n\nIf you become interested enough to continue with this practice, you will find that processing an album will eventually take less time, but a fac tor of probably several hundred percent or more, once you become familiar enough with what and how to.\n\nHow to record a vinyl LP to hard drive\n\nReply #18 – 2006-08-14 12:04:36\n\ni dont know how safe this is and have never tried it on my own records but i have a friend who never plays his vinyl once he has got a good rip and last time i spoke to him about his rips he said he was using canned air (the stuff used to clean inside pc's) to clean them with good results. anyone else tried this? it seemed a bit insane to me but maybe he is onto something.\n\nHow to record a vinyl LP to hard drive\n\nReply #19 – 2006-08-14 13:03:48\n\nVacuuming, to remove fluids, is very good but definitely don't dry vacuum. Also, you need a proper LP to vacuum cleaner interface. There are several that work but none come standard with any home vacuum cleaner.\n\nI will second the recommendation for proper vacuum cleaning as the best method. I experimented for a while in trying to build my own using an old turntable I bought in a junk shop, but in the end shelled out for a commercial design (a Moth RCM Mk2). Other well-known vacuum cleaners are the VPI and Nitty-Gritty devices. The Keith Monks is probably the best of the bunch, but it costs thousands.\n\nWaveRepair is quite labor intensive. I doubt it is possible to find another program that can give you better results -- if you are willing to put in the time and effort to use it properly -- but other programs can produce good results with less work.\n\nAndy has summed up Wave Repair pretty well. It is fundamentally a special-purpose WAV editor that has a number of editing features specifically aimed at fixing the type of defects found on vinyl records. It it very *unlike* most other restoration packages, which typically aim to do things automatically. It doesn't include the type of effects that you find in general purpose editors - only the ones needed for vinyl restorations.\n\nAs a general rule, automatic restoration has the very significant advantage of requiring far less effort on the part of the user, but there are three basic disadvantages:\n\n(i) some damage will be missed. You can then use another editor to address this.\n\n(ii) some non-damage will be \"fixed\". This is a major bummer; you need to use these tools with a \"light touch\" to avoid this kind of problem. For example, brass and reed instruments such as trumpet/sax/etc are routinely trashed by over-zealous declicking.\n\n(iii) some genuine damage will be changed but not fixed. Most commonly, big clicks and pops are replaced by thuds and splats, which are usually harder to track down manually than the original click/pop. If you plan to run an automatic declicker, it's generally a good idea to manually remove big clicks/pops first to avoid this scenario.\n\nI've never found an automatic declicker that can fix low-frequency thumps caused by things such as \"vinyl pimples\" or \"fast warps\".\n\ngrod49 asked if Wave Corrector would be easier to use than Wave Repair for a beginner. The answer is that for automatic declicking, Wave Corrector is easier to use regardless of the experience of the user. I sometimes use it myself. One nice aspect of Wave Corrector is that is allows you to review each detected click and tell it whether or not to actually fix it. Very few declickers have this option. (As it happens, Wave Repair does, but I am happy to acknowledge that Wave Repair's automatic declicking is not as good as Wave Corrector's).\n\nIn summary, all I can suggest is that you download as many restoration packages as you can and try them out before making any buying decisions. If there is no evaluation version available, be suspicious: what have they got to hide? You wouldn't buy a car without a test drive, so don't do it with restoration software. It's unlikely that you'll find one single program that will do everything you need - even though I wrote Wave Repair and therefore know it inside out, I sometimes crank up various other programs when I have specific tasks to perform.\n\nHow to record a vinyl LP to hard drive\n\nReply #20 – 2006-08-14 23:23:33\n\nSomeone will likely crucify me and tell me I'm an idiot for this but...\n\nThe vast majority of record cleaners use isopropyl alcohol as the main cleaning solution. I have a can of electrical contact cleaner which is basically isopropyl alcohol. I spray it on my record-cleaning brush (one of those el-cheapo things) and give the records a wipe while they spin. It removes fingerprints, spilled booze, all sorts of nasty crud. Dries (evaporates) in seconds, too. Then I give the records another spin and wipe them with a dry brush, a carbon-fiber thing. Between the two, they look pristine to the eye and my stylus always looks clean after playing the record. Maybe in 2 years I'll find out I ruined my vinyl, but it cleans them like a charm, and now I have them on CD. Your mileage may vary.\n\nHow to record a vinyl LP to hard drive\n\nReply #21 – 2006-08-15 09:49:13\n\nSomeone will likely crucify me and tell me I'm an idiot for this but...\n\nThe vast majority of record cleaners use isopropyl alcohol as the main cleaning solution.

Excessive/repeated use of isopropyl alcohol on vinyl LPs is not a good idea. IPA can leech the plasticisers from the vinyl mix, leaving it brittle and prone to micro-cracking. But a one-off thorough cleaning where the IPA is removed quickly should be fine. (Note that record cleaning solutions that include IPA are typically no more than 20% IPA, the rest being distilled water. You should never apply undiluted IPA to vinyl LPs).\n\n2. You say the solution removes dirt. Some of it will of course be removed when you wipe the record as it spins, but quite a lot will be left behind. Capilliary action really isn't a very good way of lifting solutions off LPs. What remains gets re-deposited onto the LP when the rest of the IPA evaporates, albeit spread around more evenly rather than in localised spots.\n\n3. LPs that look pristine can be anything but. Even brand new records often have mould release agent still in the grooves that's worth removing. Until you've tried vacuum cleaning it's difficult to appreciate the difference it can make."
