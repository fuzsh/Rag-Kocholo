        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nIt took just mere minutes after President Biden announced that he was dropping out of the 2024 presidential race for savvy retailers and Etsy sellers alike to put up Kamala Harris merch for sale online.\n\nFrom Amazon to Etsy and Redbubble, designers were quick to capitalize on the Democratic party’s news to churn out everything from Kamala-inspired T-shirts, to coffee mugs and prayer candles. The designs riff off everything from the Vice-President’s most famous quotes, to her now-viral “coconut tree” meme. While these aren’t official Harris campaign offerings, the rush of new fan-made merch could reflect the momentum that seems to have been created after Biden’s exit.\n\nNow, with the announcement of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate, sellers have also offered up a host of Harris Walz 2024 merch online (think everything from bumper stickers to bobbleheads).\n\nHere’s a small sampling of the best Kamala Harris and Tim Walz 2024 merch to find online right now."
