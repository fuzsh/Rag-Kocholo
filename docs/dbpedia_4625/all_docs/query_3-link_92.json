        "text": "Upgrade Your Home; Upgrade Your Life\n\nRinnai tankless hot water heaters are built to commercial-grade standards and each individual unit is tested for quality. So you may never need our industry-leading warranty and legendary support for the most important appliance in your home.\n\nNever Run Out of Hot Water\n\nWith a Rinnai tankless water heater, you’ll never have to choose between taking a piping hot shower, doing a load of laundry, or running the dishwasher. Hot water is always available.\n\nBetter Value Than a Tank\n\nRinnai tankless water heaters last up to twice as long, have twice the warranty, and save energy as they only heat water when it is needed. Consumer financing and rebates are also often available.\n\nSee if you’re eligible for a rebate.\n\nSave Valuable Space\n\nSmall and mighty, the suitcase-sized wall units fit in tight, discreet spaces, freeing up more usable living area in your home. No more storing large quantities of water that could potentially leak on your floor. Also, parts are usually replaceable, rather than replacing the entire unit.\n\nTechnology to Improve Your Lifestyle\n\nSelect models have the Rinnai Smart-Circ™ Intelligent Recirculation™ that learns your hot water usage pattern and schedules your recirculation accordingly, providing you with hot water faster and when you need it. With the additional purchase of an RWM200 wireless module (sold separately, compatible with most condensing models), you can integrate it into your smart home technology for greater control and have on-demand hot water in seconds.\n\nAccessory Details\n\nReliability You Can Count On\n\nEvery Rinnai tankless water heater is individually tested for quality before shipping. Unlike many competitors, Rinnai makes the vast majority of our key components, allowing for consistent control of quality. That’s why more consumers and businesses choose Rinnai over any other tankless brand.\n\nThe Rinnai PRO Network\n\nBecause professional installation is highly recommended, Rinnai has an extensive network of trained and experienced professional installers to provide you with superior product performance. A Rinnai PRO will help you choose the right model for your needs, provide you with financing options, and perform a top-quality installation."
