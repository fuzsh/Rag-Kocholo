Vinyl plank flooring is stylish and cost effective, but before you pick out your new floors, it’s important to understand the various factors that impact vinyl plank flooring costs. Our guide will walk you through the options—and everything else you need to know to plan your vinyl plank flooring installation.*\n\nNote: Article cost data via Angi, Fixr, FlooringStores.com, and the World Floor Covering Association (WFCA).\n\nMajor Cost Factors of Vinyl Plank Flooring Installation\n\nMaterial quality, room size, and labor costs are the primary factors that determine vinyl plank flooring cost.\n\nFactor 1: Cost by Type of Vinyl Plank Flooring\n\nAlthough homeowners have a myriad of choices when it comes to style and color, most vinyl plank flooring falls into one of two categories: standard vinyl planks or luxury vinyl planks (LVP). High-end flooring in the LVP category offers greater durability, a more authentic appearance, and superior water resistance. As a result, you can expect LVP flooring to cost more than standard vinyl planks.\n\nIn the table below, we’ve listed the average cost per square foot for vinyl planks and luxury vinyl planks, as well as a few other vinyl flooring options for comparison.\n\nFactor 2: Cost by Vinyl Plank Thickness\n\nVinyl planks range between 2 and 8 millimeters (mm) thick, depending on the core’s thickness, underlayment, and wear layers. Thicker planks feel better underfoot, last longer, and provide better sound insulation. As a result, the thicker the planks, the higher the investment.\n\nThe wear layer’s thickness is often the most important factor because it directly affects durability. This layer protects the thin topcoat—which features the printed wood pattern—from scratches, scuffs, and stains.\n\nFactor 3: Cost by Core and Finish\n\nVinyl planks have different core materials and finishes that affect their price. Those with stone-plastic or stone-polymer composite (SPC) cores, also known as rigid-core planks, are harder but more durable. Meanwhile, wood-plastic or wood-polymer composite (WPC) cores have more give and a slightly higher cost.\n\nMost vinyl planks are designed to resemble hardwood flooring. The finish may be either printed on a topcoat or inlaid into the plank. Printed topcoat patterns are less durable and realistic, so you won’t often see them on luxury vinyl planks. Inlaid patterns have more texture, durability and a higher price tag.\n\nFactor 4: Cost by Size and Shape of Room\n\nInstalling vinyl flooring in a large or irregularly shaped room costs more than a modestly sized, rectangular room. A larger room that requires more planks and installation will take longer—increasing both material and labor costs. Oddly shaped rooms make installation more complex by requiring more cuts and creating more waste. The extra time and materials translate into higher overall costs.\n\nFactor 5: Labor Cost\n\nProfessional installation is typically billed by the square foot, though some contractors charge a flat fee or hourly rate instead. The cost largely depends on the required room size and installation method. For instance, a floating floor of click-and-lock planks will take less time to install than peel-and-stick tiles or glue-down planks.\n\nBased on national averages, you can expect to pay about $1 to $6 per square foot or $30 to $50 per hour for vinyl plank flooring installation. For luxury vinyl plank flooring, costs can go as high as $10 per square foot. Additional services, such as old flooring removal and subfloor repair, increase total costs.\n\nProfessional vs. DIY Vinyl Plank Flooring Installation\n\nInstalling vinyl plank flooring can be a do-it-yourself (DIY) project, even for those with little home improvement experience. Many vinyl planks use a simple click-together installation method, and you can find an abundance of video tutorials online. However, hiring a professional does have advantages that may justify the high cost.\n\nProfessional\n\nWhen you hire flooring contractors, you can sit back and relax while seasoned pros handle the entire installation process. The contractors will remove your old flooring and make repairs to the subfloor as needed before installing the underlayment and vinyl planks. You will have to pay for labor, and the material cost may be higher, but you will reap the following benefits.\n\nTime savings: New flooring installation can be a time-consuming process. Professionals work more efficiently and complete the job faster than the average DIY’er.\n\nQuality results: Experienced flooring installers know how to avoid the mistakes a DIY’er might make. Professional installation is especially prudent for glue-down planks.\n\nLabor warranty: Reputable contractors typically provide a work warranty, which provides peace of mind and financial protection beyond the manufacturer’s warranty.\n\nExpert insight: Professionals can recommend the best vinyl planks and underlayment for your situation. They can also help you obtain any necessary permits.\n\nDIY\n\nIf you choose the right type of vinyl planks and your subfloor is in good condition, you may be able to install the flooring yourself. All you need is time, patience, and some basic DIY skills—or the willingness to learn. With a DIY installation, you won’t have to worry about labor costs, only the tools and flooring materials.\n\nBefore attempting to install vinyl plank flooring, research material costs and find out what tools you need. Be honest about your skill level and how long the project will take, then consider whether it’s worth the money you will save. Since labor rates vary significantly, get quotes from local contractors for the specific flooring you have in mind. Compare that to the time, money, and effort required for a DIY installation. Ask yourself:\n\nCan I commit the time and effort required?\n\nDo I have the necessary tools and skills?\n\nHow soon do I need the space to be functional?\n\nAm I comfortable troubleshooting issues that arise?\n\nAm I willing to accept the potential trade-off between cost and quality?\n\nOn the high end, assuming labor costs $6 per square foot plus an extra $1 to install underlayment, you could save $2,240 on an average 16-by-20-foot living room. On the low end, assuming labor costs $1 per square foot, you would only save $320.\n\nHow to Reduce Vinyl Plank Flooring Installation Costs\n\nHomeowners have several options to reduce vinyl flooring installation costs. Here are a few suggestions:\n\nDIY installation: Eliminate labor costs by handling the installation yourself.\n\nMaterial selection: Choose a product that strikes the right balance between cost and quality.\n\nBundling: Bundle multiple projects together so you can buy in bulk or save on labor costs.\n\nSpecial deals: Keep an eye out for sales, coupons, promotions, and clearance events.\n\nComparison shopping: Compare quotes and prices from multiple contractors or suppliers to find the best deal.\n\nDIY removal: Remove old flooring yourself, and handle any subfloor repairs before your professional flooring installation.\n\nFlexibility: Plan your project for an off-peak season, when labor rates might be lower, and materials may cost less.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Vinyl Plank Flooring for Your Home\n\nThe vinyl plank flooring you choose will determine the overall cost and quality of new flooring. Weigh the durability of different products against their cost to narrow down options. For instance, high-traffic areas call for more durable flooring, such as high-end luxury vinyl planks. Here’s a table to help you compare the pros and cons of different types of vinyl flooring.\n\nSound absorption, water resistance, and durability vary significantly—even for products in the same category. For instance, all vinyl flooring is water-resistant but not necessarily waterproof. Some types require a vapor barrier to prevent moisture from seeping into the subfloor. Sound absorption depends on the underlayment’s thickness and material used, while durability depends on the core material and wear layer’s thickness.\n\nWarranties also vary by manufacturer. You can expect better warranties on luxury vinyl flooring than basic peel-and-stick vinyl, but length and terms vary.\n\nHow to Measure Your Room for Vinyl Plank Flooring Installation\n\nThe room’s size and shape is a major factor in determining the cost of installing vinyl plank flooring. Follow these steps to measure how many square feet of flooring you need so you can accurately estimate costs.\n\nGather supplies. You will need something to measure with and somewhere to record the measurements. If you use a measuring tape, move furniture and other obstacles to clear a path. Alternatively, you can use a laser measure to streamline the process. Have a pen and paper handy, or use the notes app on your phone to record measurements.\n\nMeasure the width. Choose a starting point on the longest wall and measure the distance to the opposite wall. Measure in feet and inches and be as precise as possible.\n\nMeasure the length. Measure the room’s width by recording the distance between the two walls not measured during the last step. If your room has an irregular shape, measure at the widest point.\n\nConvert to a decimal. If your measurements use both inches and feet, convert the feet to inches or the mixed number to a decimal. For instance, if you measured the width as 10 feet and 2 inches, you would convert that number to 122 inches or 10.167 feet. A length of 15 feet and 6 inches would be 186 inches or 15.5 feet.\n\nCalculate the area. Multiply the length by the width to calculate the area, or square footage, of the room. In the example from step 4, you would multiply 15.5 x 10.167 to get 157.58 square feet. If you converted your measurements to inches, multiply and then divide by 144 (ex: 122 x 186 = 22,692 / 144 = 157.58).\n\nAccount for wastage. You may need extra material for cuts, mistakes, and future repairs. To account for this, add 10% to 20% to the total. Multiply the total square footage from step 5 by either 1.1 (10% waste) or 1.2 (20% waste) to get the adjusted area. In our example, the new total would be 173.34 or 189.10 square feet.\n\nRepeat for additional rooms. If you have multiple rooms, hallways, or irregularly shaped areas, repeat the same measurement process for each rectangular area. Add up the square footage of each area to determine the total amount of flooring you need.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Underlayment for Your Vinyl Plank Flooring\n\nUnderlayment is an optional layer of material that goes between your subfloor and the vinyl plank flooring. The right underlayment can improve sound absorption and stability while also making the floor more comfortable to walk on. Plywood is the most common underlayment at a cost of $0.50 to $1.50 per square foot, but it’s not the only option.\n\nThe moisture resistance of most underlayment can be improved by pairing them with a vapor barrier. Materials that are not water-resistant, such as foam and felt, often come with a vapor barrier attached.\n\nEach underlayment type comes in several thicknesses, which affects the comfort level, sound absorption, and price. The best underlayment for your flooring depends on the material and the subfloor’s condition. If you have an older plywood subfloor, adding a plywood underlayment will improve stability. For concrete, you may want the padding of thick foam, while cork will hide the tile’s grout lines.\n\nHow to Hire a Professional\n\nIf you decide to hire a professional, it’s important to find an experienced, reputable contractor. Start by asking friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers for recommendations. Then look online for local contractors with positive reviews and high ratings. Be sure to check their licensing and insurance.\n\nNarrow down your options to a few reputable contractors and request detailed cost estimates. Compare the pricing, terms, and professionalism of each contender. Ask questions about the projected timeline, potential additional costs, payment terms, and past work. Be sure to clearly communicate your vision and expectations, and read any contract carefully before signing.\n\nOur Recommendation\n\nInstalling vinyl plank flooring is an excellent way to refresh your home. For example, new flooring can transform a formal dining room into a children’s playroom. Plus, it’s a cost-effective home improvement project that many homeowners can tackle on their own. However, we recommend getting quotes from at least three different companies before you choose a contractor or commit to DIY."
