This cut type doesn't leave any material around the decal. Another way to look at it is to think of it like a \"cookie cutter.\" Your decals are all individually cut out to the contour of your design, so you have individually cut decals with no paper material around the design.\n\n* Please note – Back Slit (Crack and Peel) is only available on our Standard and Permanent material options *\n\nKiss-Cut\n\nKiss-cut means we are only cutting through the vinyl layer (\"decal material\") and not cutting through the paper backing, leaving a paper material border around your decal. When you choose a kiss-cut decal, you will have extra material around your decal for easy peeling.\n\nTransfer-Cut\n\nTransfer cut option means that we will be cutting the vinyl decal material to a specified shape, graphic or text and then removing or “picking” any excess or unwanted vinyl material from your design leaving no vinyl background on your decal. We then place a transfer tape over the top of the remaining pieces of vinyl. This tape is what holds all the individual cut pieces of your decal design once you remove the paper backing from your decal. It also allows you to place multiple individual pieces of vinyl decal material on your desired surface cleanly and evenly.\n\n* Vector File (EPS or Ai – Adobe Illustrator) format needed for Transfer Cut decals. *\n\nTransfer Cut / Pick Charge\n\nTransfer cut price includes 8 standard picks with a Maximum of 40 picks per sq. foot.\n\nAdditional picks are $0.02 to $0.04 per pick depending on difficulty/intricacy.\n\nIntricately cut decals will be custom quoted based on difficulty and time required to pick.\n\nFor more information visit our transfer cut guidelines.\n\nCreate Your Product\n\nCustom Vinyl Decals Artwork Specifications\n\nPreferred Files for Printing\n\nThe maximum file size we accept is 100 MB. Our preferred file types are:\n\nAdobe Illustrator EPS (Encapsulated Post Script)\n\nPDF (Adobe PDF)\n\nWhen submitting these files, make sure you convert all fonts to outlines or curves to ensure they print correctly and the fonts are not substituted.\n\nAdditional Files Accepted\n\nJPG (High Resolution JPEG)\n\nTIFF (High Resolution TIFF)\n\nPNG (High Resolution PNG)\n\nFile Tips\n\nSet up size proportionate to the exact size product you are ordering\n\nConvert all text to outlines\n\nOnly Allow for bleed if necessary\n\nNever flatten/merge layers in a PSD file\n\nIndicate the cut line clearly for all decal products\n\nTransfer-Cut Guidelines\n\nTransfer Cutting refers to any sticker or decal that will be picked or weeded with transfer tape applied over the top of it. Most commonly used for vinyl lettering.\n\nSimple and open fonts are recommended.\n\nAll text must be at least 1/2\" tall.\n\nThe space between characters and other design elements must be at least 1/8”.\n\nMain strokes, line weights, or art elements should be a minimum of 1/8”\n\nMinimum pick size of 1/8”.\n\nWe recommend you request a proof for this product.\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nTransfer cut price includes 8 standard picks with a Maximum of 40 picks per sq. foot.\n\nAdditional picks are $0.02 to $0.04 per pick depending on difficulty/intricacy.\n\nIntricately cut decals will be custom quoted based on difficulty and time required to pick.\n\nVector Art\n\nVector art consists of lines and curves that are mathematically defined objects. When viewing art in key line mode you can see the points or vectors when connecting your lines and curves. They can also be seen when using the pen tool or editing the points along a path. Vector art is ideal for type and drawn shapes because they can be enlarged to any size while maintaining crisp outlines and details without sacrificing quality. The distance between the vectors is calculated mathematically and is not dependent upon resolution.\n\nRaster Art\n\nRaster images consist of colored squares, called pixels. They are created by combining a series of various colored pixels. Digital photographs are made up of pixels. If you view a raster image at 200% or more you are able to see the individual pixels that make up the image. Raster images are dependent upon resolution so image enlargement is limited by the individual size at which the file was created. If a file is produced at a size that is larger than its resolution will allow, the quality will decrease. Printing a low resolution file will result in pixelation. Individual pixels are large enough to be easily discernable. Increasing the resolution will not solve this problem is there are not enough pixels to begin with. The program will add more pixels based upon the estimation of their location and will then assign their neighboring pixels's color value. This may cause an image to look muddy.\n\nIf submitting these files, please follow the guidelines below:\n\n100% scale (full size output) at 100 dpi\n\n50% scale at 200 dpi or higher\n\n25% scale at 300 dpi or higher\n\n10% scale at 600-1200 dpi recommended\n\nDesign Services\n\nIf you are not able to provide us with a print ready artwork, our art department would be able to recreate your artwork in vector format for printing.
