        "text": "You’ve picked out the perfect vinyl floor and can’t wait to see how it looks. But before you get started with the installation, you have another decision to make, and it’s just as important as the flooring itself: What underlayment will you need?\n\nIn this article you will get a comprehensive overview of underlayment and subfloors for vinyl flooring. You will also know enough to avoid having to take out an insurance claim against an installer for an improper installation.\n\nWatch the video summary or read on to learn all about underlayment, or go directly to our recommendation. Either way, you will know the quickest solution for the best underlayment for vinyl flooring.\n\nWhat is Underlayment?\n\nUnderlayment is the layer of material that’s installed between the subfloor and the flooring. It works as a part of your overall flooring system, which consists of the joists, subfloor, underlayment, and the flooring surface.\n\nThe purpose of underlayment is to provide necessary moisture control, sound deadening, warmth, and to minimize deflection, which is the bend or sag in the floor caused by loading.\n\nMost modern vinyl flooring, such as Happy Feet, comes with an attached underlayment or pad, often with a moisture barrier built-in – unless the pad is cork.\n\nIf the product you choose doesn’t have an attached underlayment, you can almost always install directly over the subfloor without one. But this may result in an unsatisfactory experience. If you want to maximize softness, warmth, moisture protection, and noise reduction, then underlayment is key.\n\nUnderlayment Thickness\n\nYou may hear that a good rule of thumb is to install vinyl over 1-1.5mm underlayment or cork. But making definitive statements about max thickness without considering the density and make-up of the material can cause problems. Always speak to a flooring expert if you have a particular question about your flooring and its compatibility with underlayment.\n\nWhat About a Double Underlayment?\n\nMore is not always better, and with underlayment, too much can compromise the integrity of your floor’s locking system. Adding additional underlayment under vinyl with an attached pad can create too much cushioning, which causes the floor to come apart through use over time. That’s why double underlayment (more than one underlayment) is generally not recommended. Doing so can also void the warranty.\n\nHowever, there are instances where you can install additional underlayment. For example, if your floor has an attached cork pad, you may want to also install a very thin moisture barrier. If you follow the manufacturer’s instructions, you will be fine. Following the manufacturer’s instructions exactly will also prevent voiding the warranty.\n\nUnderlayment Benefits\n\nUnderlayment can provide a confluence of benefits: noise reduction, cushioning, warmth, and moisture/water protection. When correctly installed, underlayment can minimize deflection, especially in the seams where the planks meet, to prevent stress to the locking mechanism.\n\nSound Reduction & Absorption\n\nUnderlayment can help you reduce noise, but it won’t completely mute the sound of footfalls or clomping feet.\n\nWhen it comes to sound insulation for flooring, there are two main ratings to consider – IIC and STC. Impact Insulation Class (IIC) measures the ability of a floor to block impact noise, such as footsteps or a dropped book. Sound Transmission Class (STC) measures the ability to reduce the sound of airborne noise, such as voices and music from a sound system.\n\nThe higher the number of these ratings, the better.\n\nThe best underlayment for noise reduction will reduce both impact noise and airborne sound. If reducing sound is important to you, then you will want to pay close attention to a product’s IIC and STC ratings.\n\nCushioning & Deflection\n\nIn addition to sound absorption, underlayment can also make a noticeable difference in how your floor feels.\n\nFor example, a glue-down vinyl plank floor on concrete will feel harder and less comfortable than a floating floor with foam underlayment.\n\nJust remember that too much cushioning can cause the joints to come apart and the floor to unlock.\n\nMoisture Barrier\n\nEven though vinyl flooring is waterproof, your subfloor isn’t. That’s why an underlayment acting as a moisture barrier is essential.\n\nWarmth\n\nUnderlayment has thermal properties that can increase the warmth of the floor. Select an underlayment with a thermal R rating to help keep your floors warm.\n\nKnow that underlayment can only do so much to keep your floors warm, especially on concrete floors in your basement.\n\nVinyl flooring has a reputation for being cold, so if that’s a dealbreaker, then you may want to consider an alternative like laminate, which is warmer and feels softer. Or else you can look into radiant heating systems.\n\nThe Different Types of Underlayment\n\nThe most used types of underlayment for vinyl are cork, foam, felt, rubber, plywood, and OSB.\n\nCork\n\nWhen it comes to reducing noise in your home, cork is an excellent option. Cork is dense and can help hide imperfections in the subfloor.\n\nIf your vinyl flooring already has an underlayment, you can add compressed cork to further enhance sound insulation. However, cork is not a moisture barrier. Cork will retain moisture, which can lead to mold formation, especially if it isn’t properly installed.\n\nInstalling over a concrete slab with cork underlayment? Always lay down a moisture barrier before installing the floor.\n\nFoam\n\nFoam is a cost-effective underlayment that provides some cushioning and limited insulation with average sound dampening. The thicker the foam, the better the results. You just need to be sure to install it correctly.\n\nFoam underlayment is not a moisture barrier and can act as a water trap, leading to mold and must.\n\nFelt\n\nFelt is a popular underlayment choice, offering better sound control than foam. With foam, you also have the option to choose an attached vapor barrier, and it provides better insulation than foam and cork.\n\nParticle Board\n\nParticle board is an inexpensive way to lay a level base under vinyl flooring; however, it’s ineffective against moisture, a pain to install, and difficult to remove.\n\nRubber\n\nRubber underlayment is an effective underlayment, great for absorbing sound, adding warmth, and protecting against water damage.\n\nPlywood and OSB\n\nPlywood and OSB provides a nice and level base for LVP and LVT floors but doesn’t offer warmth or cushioning. OSB offers better durability than plywood.\n\nUnderlayment & the Subfloor\n\nThe subfloor is the foundation of any flooring installation, and its importance cannot be overstated. A smooth and effective installation of vinyl flooring requires a solid and stable subfloor that provides a strong base for the new flooring material.\n\nNo underlayment or vinyl flooring product can make up for a poor subfloor.\n\nInstalling vinyl on a rough, unclean, or damaged subfloor is like trying to build a cabin on unstable ground – it just won’t stand the test of time.\n\nWhen the floor isn’t as level as possible, the floor can drop in the low spots and cause damage to the planks. But no subfloor is going to be perfectly level. Your subfloor can have a pitch to it, but you need to avoid peaks and valleys.\n\nEnsuring that the subfloor is smooth, clean, mostly level, and free of damage (cracks) is necessary for a flawless installation. A solid and level subfloor eliminates many problems: loud creaking, dips, high spots, soft spots, bumps, and uneven lumpiness.\n\nThis is why it pays to take care to properly prepare your subfloor. You can think of it as an investment in the longevity and performance of your vinyl flooring.\n\nWhat About Leveling Agents?\n\nYou can use leveling agents, but they should be your last option.\n\nConcrete\n\nIf your vinyl flooring has a pad attached, you can install it directly over the concrete subfloor. If you don’t have a pad attached then consider using a 1mm or less foam pad to help the floor float properly.\n\nBefore you install your underlayment and flooring, repair any hairline cracks in your concrete subfloor and make sure you level it out.\n\nOver a concrete subfloor, you need a Class I moisture barrier to prevent moisture from moving up and sitting beneath your flooring.\n\nIf you install over concrete without any underlayment, there is a good chance that small amounts of moisture will be absorbed into the concrete because it’s porous.\n\nWood\n\n¼” plywood works well as a subfloor for vinyl, and you can install vinyl directly over wood. Over a wood subfloor, you need a Class II moisture retardant.\n\nIf your wood subfloor is old and worn with holes, gaps, and cracks, you can use a liquid leveling agent to create a smooth surface.\n\nExisting floors\n\nIf you have existing linoleum, wood, sheet vinyl, or tile that are level and in good condition, congratulations, you have a great foundation for installing vinyl. Never install over floating laminate or LVP/LVT.\n\nYou will save yourself time cleaning up a mess by installing over the existing floor instead of removing it.\n\nWhat if Your Subfloors Vary in Height?\n\nIf you have rooms with subfloors of different heights, it’s probably for a good reason. You will want to keep in mind the floor’s thickness and come up with a plan to manage the height difference.\n\nWith a 2mm – 1” difference, you can hire a professional to even your subfloor.\n\nLooking for the easiest and least expensive solution? Use transition molding from one floor to the other. Reducer molding transitions height differences smoothly.\n\nIf you have another type of flooring in your home that’s a particular height, you can choose the flooring thickness and underlayment thickness to be on par with that flooring.\n\nFor example, if you have tile installed that’s 6mm thick, you can install 5mm thick vinyl flooring with a 1mm underlayment to create a seamless transition from one floor to the next."
