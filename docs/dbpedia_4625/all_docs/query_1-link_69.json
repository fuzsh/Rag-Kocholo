Everyone has a story and we are all at different points of life with unique wants and needs. Understanding these truths and meeting people right where they are is at the heart of our company.\n\nLifePoint agents guide buyers and sellers, in their real estate journey, from where they are to where they want to be. Integral to our company DNA is an attitude of gratitude and commitment to “give back” as each and every agent donates a portion of their commission to a local charity and gives of their time to a variety of community service opportunities throughout the year."
