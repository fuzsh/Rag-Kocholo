        "text": "Welcome to LP Equestrian center a premier boarding facility located in Casco, Michigan. We started LP Equestrian in hopes to create a welcoming place that provides top quality individualized care for every horse and riders needs. Our daughter Lillyana's passion for horses led us down many roads on our way to creating LP Equestrian Center. This passion became a labor of love for Lillyana's father, who decided to create Lillyana her own Barn. What resulted was LP Equestrian Center.\n\nWe do this because we genuinely want to be here and love sharing our passion for riding and caring for horses with the equestrian community. We know what we value in an equestrian facility; modern amenities, caring and available staff, clean and well tended boarding and grooming areas, and that is exactly what you will experience at LP Equestrian Center. Whether you are a new rider, eager and nervous to climb into the saddle for the first time, or an experienced rider interested in Dressage, Hunter/Jumper or Eventing, we'd love for you to make LP Equestrian Center your new home.\n\nHow many stalls does LP Equestrian have?\n\nWe have just expanded by adding 8 more stalls to increase our available boarding stalls to a total of 75.\n\nWhat type of feed do you use?\n\nWe only feed premium hay, 1st and 2nd cutting. Our feed hay is stored and never wet. We feed Tribute Seniority, Kalm N EZ, and / or Kalm Ultra grain.\n\nHow often do you feed?\n\nFeeding is done twice a day and we will also feed supplements that are provided by our owners. We also make hay available on demand during the winter months for extra energy and vitality.\n\nDo you have automatic water?\n\nYes, we have automatic water system in the stalls.\n\nHow often will my horse be turned out?\n\nDepending on the weather we turn out daily from dawn til dusk. We offer customized night turn out during warm weather as well.\n\nWhat does Boarding cost per month?\n\nFull care boarding is $650/month."
