        "text": "\"In the summer of 2021 I was introduced to the French filmmaker Émilie Deleuze in Paris. She asked me if I would create a soundtrack for a film she intended to make titled Cinq Hectares. When I asked Emilie what the story of the film was about she replied \"It's a comedy and road movie , about a guy driving a tractor across France\". I love road movies and I had never composed a movie soundtrack before so I immediately said \"yes\". I recorded the soundtrack in the summer of 2022 in east London with the help of producers James Rand & Thomas Gorton of @godcolony and a bunch of great young musicians they introduced me to, one of which @alwhite who now plays saxophone with Primal Scream. Émilie's film is an absolute cracker and I'm very proud of the soundtrack. Hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we did making it” Bobby Gillespie, June 2024"
