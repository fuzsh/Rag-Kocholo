        "text": "The Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), which was established by the countries of the region known as North Africa, also called as the Maghreb, to strengthen regional cooperation, draws attention as an organization that has lost its effectiveness today. This study examines the factors that affect the &quot;failure&quot; of the AMU. The discussions for the AMU to gain an active structure, which was established with the participation of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritania and Libya in the late 1980s, have increased even more with the current political crisis in Libya. The idea of &quot;a united Maghreb&quot; was actually a political argument used to mobilize the people of the region against the colonial powers during their struggle for independence long before the establishment of the AMU. Many reasons can be put forward to explain why the leaders of the region, who used the idea of creating a &quot;united Maghreb&quot; in their discourses, did not show enough will to achieve this dream. This...\n\nIn the absence of any current form of Maghreb integration, and in light of the growing needs and concerns of the populations in the region regarding security, stability, and the opportunity to live a life with dignity, the question of reviving the Arab Maghreb Union will always remain an imperative issue. If a revival was accomplished, this process would force political regimes to cooperate, first in order to achieve stability and security, and secondly, to keep pace with changes in societal values that require reform and which are rejecting ready-made, top-down policies currently supplied by governments. This process must begin by bridging the gap between Algeria and Morocco, seizing the moment of opportunity to strengthen cooperation instead of deepening conflict. Subsequently, the broader region should work to manage the political movement in Algeria in a prudent and balanced manner. Furthermore, work must be done to find a political compromise in Libya in order to bring the country back under a centralized government after years of instability and civil war.\n\nThe book offers fresh insight into the recent political development and contrasting experiences of four Maghreb countries: Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania. The Arab Spring affected them in different ways. Tunisia underwent profound change as Ben Ali was overthrown in a fortnight. Yet in Algeria, President Bouteflika won an unprecedented fourth term in office despite being too ill to campaign. What explains these variations? Why did Ben Ali’s regime fall and Bouteflika’s survive? Why has Morocco not gone the same way as Tunisia? And what of Mauritania, the often forgotten other Maghreb country? This book addresses these and other questions by using Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way’s celebrated model for examining political transitions to analyse and compare the political development of Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania over the last ten years.\n\nBoundaries in Africa, and the inter-state cum community relations generated across them, have been major sites for the interplay of various socio-economic and political dynamics. This reflects on the dialectics of the state-society relations in the Morocco-Algeria tensions, with critical evaluations on the challenges posed by the Western Sahara crisis and the inherent paradoxes of regionalism in the Maghreb. From an analytical point of view, the author explains how leadership failure apart from all else, is central to the lingering crisis in the Maghreb. Notwithstanding the region’s high level of cultural homogeneity and a revival in the regional process, occasioned by the Arab Spring, a lot of uncertainties remain regarding whether the recent developments can give impetus to the Arab Maghreb Union or retard it. The paper finally concludes that Maghreb’s future lies in its openness and integration whose spillover is capable of addressing other problems.\n\nThis paper analyses the dynamics of relations between the two regional powers in the Maghrebi sub-regional system: Algeria and Morocco. More specifically, it examines the trajectory of the long and complex interactions between those two states as well as the key issues at stake, especially the Saharan problem. Based on extensive interviews conducted in both Algeria and Morocco, the paper compares the two country’s divergent perspectives on those issues and discusses how those differences impact on regional stability. It argues that in spite of their long history of difficult relations, Algeria and Morocco have made continuous efforts to avoid major escalations that would lead to direct military confrontation. Moreover, recent developments in the region, including Morocco joining the African Union as well as common challenges such as the fight against terrorism, have provided opportunities for the two states to cooperate.\n\nThis paper analyses the dynamics of relations between the two regional powers in the Maghrebi sub-regional system: Algeria and Morocco.
