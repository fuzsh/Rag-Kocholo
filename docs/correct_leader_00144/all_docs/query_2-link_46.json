        "text": "The celebrations of the three hundredth anniversary of the rediscovery of the statue of Our Lady of Aparecida ended recently. “Mary shows by her silence that the Gospel is proclaimed from the peripheries, the caves and cellars of humanity”.\n\nThe rediscovery of the statue by the fishermen Domingos Garcia, Joao Alves and Filipe changed lives. Filipe kept the statue rescued from the depths of the river in his house from 1717 to 1732. Mere fishermen found a statue of Our Lady immersed in water; it was broken, discoloured and grey. This happened on 12 October, 1717.\n\nThe statue is just a small sculpture by an unknown artist, probably from the ceramics school of the Benedictine Order. It measures 36 cm in height and weighs 2,550 grams. It has a silver pedestal with designs. It was probably made in the first half of the seventeenth century. To the eyes of the artist and the people of Brazil, it has some noticeable details: the smiling form of the lips that reveal the front teeth, the face with its wrinkles, the carefully arranged hair with braids, the diadem on the forehead, the pleated skirt reaching to the ground, the small joined hands like those of a child, the plain and the refined sleeves, refined, close-fitting and folded in the style of the seventeenth century Paulistas, the original rose colour of the hands and face, worn away and darkened by the smoke of candles and the grey mud in the bottom of the river.\n\nThe cult of our Lady of the Conception was already deeply rooted in colonial Brazil and images of Our Lady with joined hands were plentiful. The Aparecida cult is the enigma of an icon that transforms itself and takes the face of the people and its dreams. We are aware that the first printed image of Our Lady of Aparecida, created in 1854, is a photo of Our Lady of the Conception with fair skin. That image was recreated and darkened by poor, black people. It directly reflects their working conditions of suffering and brings hope to thousands of exploited people. Mary always chooses the lowly and speaks their language. A people that loves her makes her go and live in the houses of the poor and, from that theological place, scatters to the four winds the news of this celestial visitation. The statue of the Immaculate Virgin presents a God who continues to want communion, beginning with the lowly. In Mary they discover the signs of a Mother who asks to be put back together, sewn up and rebuilt.\n\nIn that first moment, the head was reattached using beeswax. From this union, a Marian people was born that will never leave her. It was united in sorrow and in love by the smile of the Virgin. An immense piety blossomed in the homes and in the processions of the ordinary people. In Mexico, in 1531, we see in the Virgin of Guadalupe a preference for the indigenous people. The Morenita speaks Nahuatl and not Spanish, and wants a sanctuary in the land of the poor and not in the capital Tenochtitlan; that the Bishop. Juan de Zumarraga should come to the periphery of Tepeyac and not the contrary; that the official Church should go to the periphery of the indigenous people and half-castes; that the Church should not build a New Spain but discover in the roots and in the faces of people the authentic America.\n\nIn Brazil, for the enslaved blacks and the poor wounded by colonial exploitation, Mary does not present herself as a passively submissive woman; nor does she create an alienating religion. She is the woman able to say no and what she wants according to the will of God. Then the story is repeated in every country of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nIn Honduras she is the Virgin of the Poor, Our Lady of Suyapa; in Paraguay she is Our Lady of Caacupé; in Cuba she is the Virgin of Cobre; Our Lady of Chiquinquirà, in Colombia. At Lujan, in Argentina, she remains stubbornly fixed with local people on the left bank of the river Lujan. In Costa Rica she is Our Lady of the Angels, known as La Negrita, the Little Black Lady. She shows herself to a poor, simple child, Juana Pereira, in a place called Pueblo de los Negros, on 2 August, 1635.\n\nMary silently points out that the Gospel is to be proclaimed from the peripheries, the caves and cellars of humanity. Mary shows that the Gospel means staying with the poor and defending their lives, their faith and their hopes.\n\nAs the Brazilian bishop, Mons Luciano Mendes de Almeida, Archbishop of Marianna and former President of the Conference of the Bishops of Brazil, who died in 2006, once wrote: ‘The little image dragged up from the waters of a river by fishermen sends us a message of solidarity with her children sorely oppressed at the time. She identified with the Brazilians who were suffering the injustice of slavery. The Mother of God showed, in her face, wrinkled like that of her black children, the love she has for them and the dignity they deserve. In a time of discrimination, she became the Mother of all races and made us understand we are all brothers and sisters’.\n\nFor the last three hundred years, Mary has been the nascent Church immersing itself in the suffering people. She is the Virgin of Sorrows, the dark-skinned Mother of Heaven, the Woman restored to life. In the words of the singer-composer Father Zezinho: ‘Today I became a pilgrim, with no illusions and no utopia! I went to visit the house built for Mother Mary! And, I did so with my simple understanding of this devotion! To the Black Lady I said: Lead my people to freedom’.\n\nFernando Altemever Jr.\n\nPelargonium sidoides is a small geranium-like plant which is commonly referred to as ‘South African geranium’ or Umckaloabo in the Zulu language. It is highly regarded by traditional healers as one of the major curative plants.\n\nThe plant grows in a rosette pattern and forms thick and very dark brown underground roots that grow up to 15 cm in length. Sparsely branched stems grow from the base and the species is distinguished from others by its long stalks, greyish-green crinkled leaves which are mildly aromatic, heart-shaped and velvety.\n\nIt bears lots of characteristic reddish-purple flowers with a distinctive yellow pollen throughout the year.\n\nThe plant grows in places where the climatic conditions range from arid to dry. Although Pelargonnium sidoides has the ability to endure frosts, the plants become dormant during prolonged periods of drought or when they are grown in places having extremely cold climatic conditions.\n\nPelargonnium sidoides is endemic to Lesotho and South Africa. It is harvested from the wild for the manufacture of traditional medicine (phytomedicines) by local and international pharmaceutical industries. It usually grows in short grassland and sometimes with occasional shrubs and trees on stony soil varying from sand to clay-loam and is found at altitudes ranging from near sea level to 2,300m.Ethnomedicinal records show that traditional practitioners and local communities have been using the roots of Pelargonnium sidoides for centuries for treatment of many diseases and disorders within the framework of their therapeutic settings, a variety of illnesses including coughs and upper respiratory infections, dysentery, diarrhoea, hepatic complaints, colds, fatigue, fevers, dysmenorrhea and infections of the respiratory tract including tuberculosis. In fact, the plant’s name ‘umckaloabo‘ is derived from two Zulu words; umkhuhlane, meaning ‘fever- and cough-related diseases’, and uhlabo which means ‘chest pain’.\n\nIndeed the Pelargonnium sidoides plant is highly regarded by traditional healers as one of the major curative plants. Considered one of the mainstream traditional medicinal plants especially in South Africa and surrounding areas, Pelargonnium sidoides is also used in Germany, England and other western countries in form of a syrup as well as a cough drop or tablet. In fact, its remedy as a treatment especially for tuberculosis was popularised in England and Europe by the British mechanic Charles Henry Stevens in the 19th century. The primary purpose for using Pelargonnium sidoides as a home herbal remedy is to first and foremost shorten the period of sickness and to relieve the affected person’s symptoms. The remedy also breaks up mucus, fights bacteria, and works as an antiviral agent.\n\nThe main medicinal part of the plant is the fleshy dark brown rhizomes which are dried and formulated into powders, tinctures and infusions. Its potent antibacterial and antiviral properties are ideal in the treatment of chronic respiratory tract infections such as sore throat, sinusitis, colds and flu. The plant is very effective for treating acute bronchitis and has great ability in increasing the body’s natural healing ability from a myriad of diseases and disorders.\n\nPelargonnium sidoides decoction is used in some communities to treat stomach ulcers. Indeed scientific studies show that Pelargonnium sidoides extracts are effective against Helicobacter pylori bacteria, the main causative agent of stomach ulcers. In addition, Pelargonnium sidoides is also effective in treating acute as well as chronic throat, nose and ear infections.\n\nThe plant is used to treat upper respiratory infections, and common cold. It is also used to treat sexually transmitted diseases including gonorrhoea and herpes. Infusion of the roots of Pelargonnium sidoides has been orally administered to treat coughs, and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea and dysentery. In addition, the plant has also been used to provide a cure for hepatic disorders and dysmenorrhea. Its upper parts are ground into powder form and used as a wound healing agent.\n\nThe plant is also used to invigorate the body’s immune system, thereby helping to put off the spread of microbial infections. This is the main reason why many people use this herbal remedy as a substitute for various antibiotics.\n\nThe therapeutic attributes of Pelargonnium sidoides are due to the various phytochemicals contained in the plant especially the presence of a remarkable series of simple coumarins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, gallic acid and the gallic acid, methyl ester, which greatly contribute to the herb’s antibacterial, antifungal, anti-mycobacterial and immuno-modulatory properties which make it highly curative. It also contains calcium and silica which are essential minerals in the body.\n\nThe greatest threat to Pelargonnium sidoides currently is the over harvesting of its tubers for local and export purpose, habitat transformation and degradation. Loss of the plant population to habitat transformation as a result of urban development and agricultural activities has occurred in most of the historic sites, leading to mass reduction in the wild population of the plant. Therefore, a lot has to be done to conserve this highly valuable medicinal plant and prevent it from future extinction.\n\nRichard Komakech\n\nThe big winner in the Middle East is Russia. Thus, it will be Russia that will play the biggest role in its post-Islamic State organization.\n\nIt was Russia that turned Turkey into an ally even after the latter’s air force shot down a Russian Sukhoi-24 jet in November 2015. Then in 2017, Russian backed Syrian forces took back Aleppo, as the various Islamist militias that occupied the Eastern part of the city were pushed out. Erdogan, who faced off a coup attempt in July 2015 while dealing with a series of bombings claimed by the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) realize that it would be fruitless to support the anti-Asad militias in Syria.\n\nIt was more important for Turkey to contain Kurdish ambitions to set up an enclave on its southern border than to overthrow the government of al-Asad. Preserving the integrity of the Syrian State became as much of a goal for President Erdogan – at least in the short term – as it was for Putin. Now, Turkey sits at the winners’ table and can help decide just what kind of independence the Kurds can aspire. Having already persuaded the Americans to relinquish Kurdish nation building in Iraq – supported by Israel no less – Erdogan can thwart any hope that the Syrian Kurds can set up an independent territory, led by the PKK’s allies and capable of unsettling Turkish sovereignty. However, the Russians have also reached agreements with the Kurdish forces in Syria, who are expecting rewards for having contributed to smash the Islamic State, reducing them to a fragmented guerrilla force at best.\n\nThe Russians want stability in Syria above all, thus they are prepared to ‘persuade’ their Syrian allies in Damascus to concede a much greater degree of autonomy for the Kurds, who make up some 11.0% of the population. Ultimately, had Damascus failed to regain Palmyra, Aleppo, parts of the capital while steadily weakening the various militias and ISIS, the Turks would have prepared contingencies for a fragmentation of Syria and the end of the Sykes-Picot agreements, which marked the map of the present Middle East 100 years ago. A Kurdish independent political entity could have taken root in such a scenario, which would have resulted in undermining Turkey’s stability. But, as with so many of the Middle East’s current complexities, explanations must be sought in the post-World War I scenario. Perhaps, Kurdish nationalist dreams will have to wait until the entire Middle East rearranges itself. Until then, The Kurds are resigned to living stuck between the various States and can at most expect to win self-rule within these.\n\nAlessandro Bruno\n\nThe West will always choose Turkey over the aspirations of the Kurds. This is one area where The Americans and the Russians agree, allowing Rojava to separate from Syria. Russia has no desire to compromise relations with Turkey even as it tries to capitalize on success in Syria to strengthen its military presence. The Americans have withheld their backing for the Kurdish referendum in Iraq and they’re not likely to encourage the PYD. In Iraq, Turkey has established good relations with the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) led by Barzani, until recently, and the Iraqi Kurdish Party (KDP). Turkey has even invested heavily in KRG controlled areas. If the Kurds gave up their ambitions peacefully after the Iraq army occupied the area after the September 25 referendum, it’s because Barzani used it to revive the fortunes of the PDK (Democratic Party of Kurdistan) within Iraq itself.\n\nIn this regard, Abdullah Ocalan may have a bigger role in the specific Kurdish context. Ocalan, leader of the PKK has been in jail since 1999. He has led the guerrilla war against the Turkish state and until a few years ago maintained good ties to the Syrian government. Ocalan offers Kurds nationalism but also a vision in which to shape it. Ocalan appears favorable to a Syria organized as a democratic speaks of a democratic confederation emerging in Syria. Ocalan proposes something that appears to be a socialist utopia, marked by popular Assemblies, equal right for all, (not just the Kurdish), social welfare, a fair distribution of resources, the end of violence against women and care for the environment: these are what the pillars of the ideal Kurdish society.\n\nBut so long as Kurds remain autonomous, they remain problematic, if not dangerous, to their ‘host’ States. Depending on the state of their relations with the respective governments, Kurdish loyalty varies considerably to the point where superpower or regional interests can exploit this weakness into collaboration to the detriment of the host Country. In Iraq, the Kurds welcomed the American invasion in 2003 and supported it. From 1991 to 2003, Iraqi Kurdistan, protected by a UN No-fly zone resolution, has come the closest to achieving de-facto independence.\n\nThe Iraqi Kurds managed to unite to obtain the constitution of a federal statute and a separate ruling body, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), chaired by Massoud Barzani. The KRG could also boast a substantial fighting force of almost 200,000 before ISIS, the Peshmerga. The Iraqi army is not allowed to enter Kurdish territory. But, much to the anger of Baghdad authorities, foreign oil companies have secured oil contracts with foreign companies independently, exporting crude oil to Turkey, but also securing more exploration and export agreements.\n\nIn Syria, the Kurds promptly abandoned Damascus as soon as the revolts of southern Syria spread to Damascus and beyond. Therefore, when Kurds are repressed, they threaten national security and unity. The inclination for Kurds to associate with ‘outsiders’ with designs has exposed Kurdish nationalism to exploitation. That is also their undoing, as the various Kurdish factions are being reminded once again. Foreign interests will always take precedence over those of the Kurds. The Americans did not back the Kurdish referendum and they won’t back one in Syria either, even if they played a significant role in fighting ISIS.\n\nIn the current Sykes-Picot arrangement of the Middle East, the Kurds must always be prepared to be disappointed. The concept of an independent Kurdistan, attempted through the project known as ‘Rojava’ remains a chimera. It was always bound to fail, because no superpower, given the interests with Turkey, could impose a Kurdish State to rise along the Turkish border. Such a State would always be under fire from Turkish artillery to the north and under pressure from an Arab majority to the south. There may be no stronger incentive for an alliance of Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran than the pursuit of Kurdish independence.\n\nThe risk exists, however, that after the various parties in the Syrian war reconcile (other than the most extreme factions), the softening of confessional dissonance of Sunni vs. Shiite and no more common ISIS enemy to pursue, could result in Kurdish-Arab ethnic discord against a more pressing Kurdish nationalism. Moreover, tensions have also developed among the different Kurdish organizations, for they don’t all have the same vision. The emergence of a proto-Kurdish State in the Syrian region – Rojava – governed according to Ocalan’s Marxist principles clashed with the Iraqi Kurds and the more tribal interests pursued by the government of Mas’ud Barzani. This is not unusual of course. For years, the prospect of a Palestinian State has suffered because of contrasts between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.\n\nBut, the Kurds can at least count on the viability of achieving autonomy first. The KRG has given Kurds the hope and the experience that in spite of all the difficulties, independence does not have to be the only desirable outcome. The autonomy of each separate Kurdish minority within their respective states can work, even if the prospects of a future union may have to be shelved or considerably delayed. Still, Autonomy can work better for some. The Kurds of Iraq can use independence as a card to play against the Iraqi central government, should the latter cease making concessions to the KRG. They have leverage in the form of control over rich oil and gas resources, giving them a few cards more with which to negotiate with Baghdad. (A.B.)\n\nThe Kurds have become one of the key players of the Middle East. They have secured autonomy alliances with superpowers and attracted investors to their resource rich region. But, the chances of full independence range from zero to few for the time being.\n\nThe Syrian government appears to have survived the conflict that was more an international war by proxy than a civil war. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey have pursued their own regional and national interests with the United States’ blessing. The Russians, Iranians and Lebanese Hezbollah defended the Syrian Baath regime and the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Asad.\n\nThe Kurds, of whom there 30 million, have nationalist ambitions which might render the ‘peace’ more complex than the current war. The Kurds have never had their own State, but they have been living in enclaves located in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Armenia. As the war against Islamic State has ended in the Levant, the Syrian Kurds are hoping to gain significant autonomy from Damascus as part of the spoils of war. But, despite a successful Kurdish referendum in Iraq in September, the Iraqi government has managed to thwart nationalist ambitions. Most Kurds live in Turkey, a NATO member backed by the United States. This is one of the main reasons that the West cannot encourage Kurdish nationalism; it would interfere with the internal politics of an allied State. Conversely, the West’s inability has been compounded by Russian President Putin’s considerable strategic instinct. Let there be no mistake.\n\nThe Kurdish Question\n\nThe Kurds dream about a united or greater Kurdistan. It’s not clear what shape that vision could take, given there are different conceptions of Kurdistan, depending on the origin (i.e. Iraqi, Syrian, Turkish, Iranian etc.) The common denominator is that none of the hot States will give up sovereignty over parts of their territory willingly. There’s the risk that the aspirations will remain repressed.\n\nPerhaps, the Kurds of Syria may have a chance now of persuading Damascus to allow greater autonomy, given the role they played in the struggle against ISIS and the accords they made with the Russians. As for the Kurds of Iraq, they will have to forego anything more ambitious than the current autonomy framework within an Iraqi State despite the result of the independence referendum held on September 25th of 2017.\n\nThe Americans ‘betrayed’ the Kurds, fearing Turkey’s reaction. Ankara argues that an independent Kurdish State on its borders raises the hopes of Kurdish separatists in Turkey. Iran, in turn, has tightened security at the border area.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey will prevent the Syrian Kurds in the area known as Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan), the related Democratic Unity Party (PYD) and their military arm known as the Popular Protection Units (YPG) to be nothing short of a PKK extension. The Turks have been attacking the YPG as well as ISIS in Syria. Turkey will not stop to obstruct the PYD/YPG unless it can cub its ambitions. (A.B.)\n\nWhen we visited the Anthropological Museum of Luanda we were fascinated by a small statue known as ‘The Thinker’, which is the cultural symbol of Angola and to which an evocative apologue is linked.\n\nThe National Museum of Anthropology (Museu Nacional de Antropologia), which is located in the Barrio dos Coqueiros of Luanda, is one of the most important in the capital of Angola; it is certainly the oldest, being founded in 1976, just a little less than one year after Angola’s proclamation of independence. The National Museum of Anthropology is a scientific, cultural and educational institution committed to the collection, research, preservation, presentation and spread of Angolan culture in the world.\n\nThe most famous of the sculptures exhibited at the Anthropological Museum of Luanda is, beyond any doubt, the 16 cm high statuette, known as ‘The Thinker’, depicting a man with elbows posed on his knees and hands placed on his head, although some scholars think that the sculpture represents an elderly woman. Much has been written on this thin statuette, which was found in 1937 in Lunda, a central African region inhabited by the Cowke people, an ethnic group. It is amazing how people are fascinated by both the absolute purity of the lines and the ‘modernity’ of this statuette that reminds us of some masterpieces of great contemporary sculptors.\n\nThe hands that hold the back of the skull tightly with a dynamic gesture, symbolize the tight hermeticism of thought, by actually synthesizing the popular idea of the wisdom of the old man among this ethnicity. Cokwe elders are, in fact, considered thinkers and philosophers par excellence, given their habit of meditation and their constant search for etiological, cosmological and cosmogonic elements. The strength and depth of thought of these wise people has been handed down to us through an apologue that tradition links to the ‘Thinker’ image.\n\nIt is said that the living copy of this statuette was a very old soba (village chief) who lived in a village called Chitato. He used to complain: “Trees drop their seeds into the ground and so when the die they can be born again, while man is a seed that when placed under the ground does not sprout anymore. All my friends are dead, I’m about to leave and I won’t be able to enjoy the sunlight any more. Why are the stars gloriously eternal and men melancholically mortal?”.\n\nAccording to the legend, God finally decided to give an answer to this tormenting dilemma. He promised that he would explain everything, as long as a very solid house without doors or windows and with just a narrow entrance was built.\n\nThe next day the house was built and in front of the great crowd, God made the sun and the moon enter the house and commanded that a dish with food for each person of the village should be put inside the house. Then God made a man and a dog enter the house and they were given their respective dishes with food. Finally, the small entrance of the house was completely walled up. After doing so, God dismissed all the crowd and told the multitude to return there the next day.\n\nThe morning after, the people of the village gathered in front of the walled up house, and God ordered that the entrance that had been closed the previous day be reopened and so all the people, to their astonishment, could verify that the sun and the moon, despite the fact that there were no doors or windows, were not inside the house anymore and that the sun was triumphantly coming up over the horizon. The food rations had been left untouched.\n\nWhile the man and the dog were inside the house and were finishing eating their food rations, God said, “You, man, and your dog have not been able to cross the walls and get out of the house; you eat and that is why you die; the sun and the moon came out of the house even though it was walled up; they did not touch the food, they disappeared and for this reason they are immortal”.\n\nPedro Santacruz\n\nThe Jesuits in Africa are 1,600, and they work in 34 countries. They are mainly involved in the fields of education, management of natural resources, prevention of AIDS, and assistance to refugees. In addition, they dedicate themselves to the training of the future African leaders.\n\nThe Jesuit presence in Africa dates back to 1542 when, two years after the founding of the Society of Jesus by St. Ignatius of Loyola, the first mission was established in Congo. In 1554, some Jesuits were sent to Ethiopia to establish their first contact with the Christians living in that area, while in 1561 they settled in present-day Zimbabwe.\n\nSince then the Jesuit missions have spread throughout the continent, and today the African Conference of Jesuits gathers the Jesuits of seven provinces and two regions of Africa together. The countries of North Africa are part of the provinces of France and of those of the Middle East.\n\nhe apostolate of the Society of Jesus in Africa mainly focuses on formation. The so-called formation houses, which are institutes of philosophy and theology, are five in all Africa. These formation centres play a decisive role in understanding the mission of the Society of Jesus in the continent. These institutes provide formation for almost 300 Jesuits and hundreds of students, whether lay or religious of different orders and confessions. Thanks to these initiatives, the Society of Jesus forms the new African leaders according to Christian values, and principles of justice and peace.\n\nAmong the formation centres it is worth mentioning two important theological institutes: the Hekima College in Nairobi (Kenya), founded in 1984, and the Theological Institute of the Society of Jesus in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), which opened its portals in 2003, and three Institutes of Philosophy: the Saint Paul Philosophate in Antananarivo (Madagascar ), the Arrupe College in Harare (Zimbabwe) and the Institute Saint Pierre Canisius in Kimwenza, (Democratic Republic of Congo), one of the historical structures of the Jesuits in Africa which was established 1954. In 2000, the faculty was incorporated into the Faculty of Philosophy of the Pontifical Gregorian University of Rome.\n\nSocial centres, AIDS and refugees\n\nThe intense activity of the Jesuits in Africa also includes the social apostolate. After about fifty years of activities, the social centres of the Society of Jesus are currently re-orientating their commitment. The seven social centres in Chad, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, DRC, Zambia and Zimbabwe are adapting their work to the present situation in order to respond to current needs. The Jesuits encourage debates about peace and democracy, economy and governance, conflict and reconciliation. These centres, which are grouped in the Jesuits Africa Social Centres Network, try to mobilize society for the development of the continent.\n\nThe Jesuits in Africa are also active in the prevention of AIDS. According to UNAIDS data published in July 2017, Eastern and Southern Africa was in 2016 the region most affected by HIV both in the world and at home, with 19.4 million, the largest number of people living with the virus. In 2016, there were 790,000 new HIV infections, forty-three percent of the global total.\n\nMeanwhile, in Western and Central Africa, in the same year, around 6.1 million people lived with this disease. In response to this situation, the Jesuits established the Jesuit AIDS Network (AJAN) in 2002 to ‘help individuals, families and communities to create a society without HIV’. The network currently operates in Burundi, DRC, Kenya, Madagascar, Togo and Zimbabwe and it develops home assistance projects, provides educational, medical, nutritional and pastoral assistance to all people including orphaned children, vulnerable underage boys and girls and widows. Much of the work focuses on HIV prevention and on information in order to combat the discrimination that is very often suffered by those who have contracted this disease.\n\nThe Jesuits also offer their service to refugees. According to UNHCR, a large number of the 65.6 million people in the world who were forcibly displaced in 2016 were living in the African continent. They were forced to flee their homes because of critical realities such as those in the DRC, the Horn of Africa, the Central African Republic or South Sudan. In 1980, the then General Father, Pedro Arrupe, founded the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS), an international organization whose programmes are found in over 50 countries around the world.\n\nJRS has four regional offices in Africa, in Chad, Kenya, Burundi and South Africa through which the organization serves 15 countries. Most of the workers contributing to the work of JRS work on a voluntary basis; they are Jesuit priests, religious women and men of other orders and lay people. The purpose of JRS is to ‘serve, accompany and defend’ refugees and internally displaced people by helping them to rebuild their own lives and to have hope in the future despite the unexpected and painful flight from their own villages where they had a house and a piece of arable land that allowed them to live.\n\nSocial justice\n\nThe commitment to the protection of human rights has become a fundamental point of the Jesuits’ mission, especially after the 2008 General Congregation. Forced migration, peace and human rights and, finally, the management of natural and mineral resources are at the centre of the Jesuits’ action in Africa.\n\nThe Jesuit Network on Peace and Human Rights in this continent mainly focuses on the situation in the Great Lakes region, which was a theatre of tragic events, such as the Rwandan genocide in 1994, the civil war in Burundi, which began in 1993 and officially ended in 2005, as well as the conflict in the Congolese provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu which is still an open wound in the region.\n\nWhile Rwanda and Uganda are currently experiencing a relative stability, political instability remains an ongoing concern in Burundi. On 4 September of this year, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry said Burundian officials at the highest level should be held accountable for crimes against humanity, and in DRC, guerrilla groups’ attacks, some of which are supported or encouraged by Rwanda and Uganda, do not allow civilians to lead a normal life. Forced population displacements, massacres of civilians and other serious violations of human rights make this area one of the most unstable in the continent. The abuses committed against women and young people by rebels and even soldiers are the order of the day in the region.\n\nLeonard Chiti and Rigobert Minani, two of the Jesuits promoting the Jesuit commitment in Africa, acknowledge that ‘in spite of several regional and international attempts, mainly promoted by the United Nations and the International Conference for the Great Lakes region to bring peace to the region, no great steps forward were made in order to determine and to face the root causes of the conflict, including the proliferation of illegal arms trafficking’.\n\nThe Jesuits, therefore, have promoted a series of initiatives aimed at making investors and those who do business in the region, aware of the direct relations between war and arms proliferation. “Having a vast network of contacts around the world is the Jesuits’ strong point”, says Fr. Minani. “If we manage to use this potential, we will be able to raise the voice of those who suffer because of the proliferation and trafficking of weapons at the highest levels, in Addis Ababa (seat of AU), in Brussels or Washington. By talking about what happens in the region of the Great Lakes we will be able to contribute to the restoration of peace in the region”.\n\nNatural resources\n\nThe vast African natural resources have turned out to be the root cause of the instability of many countries of the continent. The exploitation of resources, in the majority of cases by foreign companies through privileged agreements with local governments, aggravates poverty and causes conflicts, forced population displacements and human rights violations.\n\nChad’s government, after implementing special revenues sharing systems for five years in order to allocate adequate resources critical for poverty reduction, failed to stick to the original project by cancelling the funds allocated for the population and it increased instead those which flow directly into the state budget. An example of management of natural resource revenues to the detriment of the population.\n\n‘The process of extraction of natural and mineral resources transcends local and national boundaries. That is why there is need for transnational advisory actions to regulate the sector and make multinational oil and mining companies work with greater transparency’, the constituent document of the Jesuit Network of Natural and Mineral Resources says. (M.N.)\n\nThe crisis in the western provinces of Cameroon comes as no surprise. For years it was known that the English speaking peoples in this area were dissatisfied and felt marginalised by the central government. This malcontent was known and it was feared that sooner or later it would explode.\n\nProbably the central government in Yaounde underestimated the risk and, when it decided to act, its harshness unleashed an equally harsh reaction on the part of the local people. The result has been an increase in tension with clashes leaving many dead among both the English speaking citizens and the security forces.\n\nTo understand the crisis we must go back in time. The Berlin Conference in 1884 which divided Africa in areas of influence (and had in fact divided the continent between the European powers) and assigned Cameroon to Germany. The country had become a colony of the German Kaiser, like Namibia, Tanzania and Togo.\n\nAt the end of the Great War, Germany defeated, France and Great Britain, the victorious powers divided its colonies between themselves.\n\nCameroon was split in two. The western region was annexed to Nigeria ending up under British influence.\n\nWheras rest of the country became a French colony. This balance held until 1 January 1960 when French Cameroon gained independence from Paris. In the face of this independence , the English speaking part of Cameroon broke in two. One part remained with Nigeria, the other, with a referendum, chose to reunite with Cameroon. The annexation was based on an agreement which foresaw the creation of a federal state that would allow each of the two components of society to retain its own cultural and linguistic autonomy, but within the country’s unity. And in fact in August 1961, the parliament in Yaoundé approved a federal Constitution which became effective in the September of the same year.\n\nOn paper it appeared that integration, or at least co-existence, was feasable. In actual fact, already in the first years after independence the central government began to pass policies of forced unification, centralization of the structures of power and forced assimilation. Policies which culminated in 1972 with the suppression of the federal system, and with it the birth of the United Republic of Cameroon which became in 1984, the Republic of Cameroon.\n\nThe annexation process continued and the English speaking citizens felt increasingly marginalised. With time many areas of their autonomy were eroded. And they succeeded in maintaining a certain degree of independence from Yaounde only in educational and juridical matters . In schools English continued to be taught and the courts applied a system of law similar to the British method. An ulterior blow to English speaking autonomy came in October 2016. The government sends a few French speaking teachers to the English speaking provinces and decides to curtail common law.\n\nStrong protests ensue, repressed by just as strong reaction from the police. “President Paul Biya, who has led the country for 35 years, is unaccustomed to dialogue – we are told by Fr Ludovic Lado, a Cameroonian Jesuit and political analyst -, responded to the protest by sending police and army reinforcements. This led to a ferocious repression which, in many cases, exploded in open violation of human rights. Leading members of the English speaking community were sacked suspected of backing the protesters. Some of them were arrested and taken to Yaounde, to be tried on the basis on anti-terrorism laws”.\n\nTo respond to the iron fist method a separatist movement was formed and in recent months has become radicalised, polarising further the English speaking and French speaking positions. The grievances of the English speaking citizens are no longer limited to the educational and judicial systems, instead they have gone further to the point of declaring autonomy on 1 October on the part of English speaking regions and the establishment of the Republic of Ambazonia.\n\nA republic which, at the moment is still only on paper. However protests have been intense and the reaction of the security forces even stronger. Tens of people have been killed.\n\nThe Yaounde authorities (Cameroon) have issued international warrants of arrest for the fifteen leaders of an English speaking separatist party, the South Cameroon National Council.\n\nAccording to a local web site, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, self-proclaimed president of the autonomous region, is among the wanted persons.\n\nIn a statement released at the beginning of October , Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, United Nations Comissioner for Human Rights, expressed concern about the reaction with which the government handled the peaceful demonstrations of the English speakers. He has asked for an independent inquiry to investigate the number of dead. “We urge the authorities to ensure that the police force prevents the use of force on the part of its officers– he added -. People must be able to exercise their right to assembly peacefully and speak out freely, also through uninterrupted access to the internet”.\n\nThe government has in fact blocked the flow of information, restricting or in some cases preventing access to the social networks (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.). Following the Arab Spring, social networks played a fundamental role in transmitting the password of every revolt . Yaounde, like many African governments, decided to block the server fearing that demonstrations might find a sounding board. Members of the government themselves admitted that the block was ordered to prevent social media from being used “actively to transmit false information to incite members of the public against the state institutions”.\n\nHowever, what was intended as a temporary measure became permanent. Both provinces are isolated from the social network. The United Nations defined the move an act which tramples the right of freedom of expression. “These restrictions – a UN reports affirms – must cease immediately and the government must guarantee in-depth, impartial and independent inquiry regarding all the accusations of violation of human rights perpetrated during and after the events of 1 October. The government must adopt efficacious measures to pursue and punish all those responsible for these acts of violation”. Condemnation of the violence came also from the African Union, the European Union and the United States of America.\n\nIn the face of tension in the English speaking regions the Catholic bishops of the province of Bamenda denounce ‘genocide’ and ‘ethnic cleansing’ on the part of the authorities. The local bishops point the finger at the government for in their opinion, “irresponsible use of firearms against disarmed civilians”. “Our people – the Bishops say – have been chased into their homes, some have been arrested, other mutilated and others still beaten to death. We voice our grief for the dead, for the sufferings of the wounded, for those who have lost their homes because of looting and torching and for those concerned about their loved ones who are dispersed or kidnapped”.\n\nStrong words are to be found also in a statement issued by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Cameroon. “No one has the right to kill – We denounce the violence used and we do so with all our energies”. However according to the Bishops of Cameroon, the solution is not secession, but instead greater attention for the diversity which exists in the country. « Cameroon – says archbishop Samuel Kleda of Duala – has a population of 23 million and some people want to create two different states. But many Cameroonians think this is not the solution. There is a situation of injustices which must be addressed by means of dialogue “.\n\nAccording to Ludovic Lado, the solution to the crisis must be found in international dialogue with international mediation working for a decentralisation of the structures of government. «There is also need of a change of leadership –Lado observes -. The lengthy regime of Biya (35 anni) and its policies are part of the problem in the English speaking provinces. The solution, or part of it, could come from resignation at the end of the mandate (2018). Free elections could favour a renewal of the political class. If he clings to his position, there is a risk of greater tension and more violence ».\n\nEnrico Casale\n\nAs the bloody campaign against illegal drugs and crime continues under the present administration, the Catholic Church in the Philippines responds by establishing community-based drug rehabilitation programs, caring for the victims and parents, strengthening the defence and the culture of human rights.\n\nNot since the Marcos dictatorship has human life in the Philippines been so gravely under threat from government policy. Since 30 June, 2016, a bloody campaign against drugs and crime, urged on by President Rodrigo Duterte, has wiped out thousands of lives, mostly of the poor. Almost every night in major urban centres, drug suspects are slain in the streets or in their homes, sometimes along with innocent bystanders, friends, or family members. The Philippine National Police (PNP) has claimed responsibility for more than three thousand of these killings. Even more have been committed by unknown assailants posing as anti-crime vigilantes.\n\nBishop Pablo Virgilio S. David, the incoming vice-president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), heart-stricken by the mounting mortality in his diocese of Caloocan, which he calls ‘the killing fields of the country’, was one of the first Catholic bishops to denounce the violence.\n\nThe Church is at pains in addressing the continuing slaughter of drug suspects. One reason is that the policy is not implemented through legislation but through internal action or inaction on the part of the PNP, and through signals sent to the police, and possibly to self-styled vigilantes, by the PNP leadership and the president.Another difficulty is that much of the killing is perpetrated by ‘unknown assailants’ whose links to the state cannot be easily established. In the absence of undeniable evidence of this link, all that can be asked of the PNP is to reduce the number of suspects killed in its own operations and to press for more efficient investigation of the ‘deaths under investigation’ (Mils).\n\nMinistering to the victims.\n\nThe Church’s most systematic intervention to date has been the establishment of community-based drug rehabilitation programs, viewed not only as a form of compassionate pastoral care, but also as a way of reducing the numbers killed. Three dioceses have launched such programs: the Salubong Program in the Diocese of Caloocan; Abot-Kamay Alang-Alang sa Pagbabago (AKAP) in the Diocese of Novaliches; and the Sanlakbay Program in the Archdiocese of Manila.\n\nEach program draws upon the expertise of professional psychologists and counsellors, including the Psychological Association of the Philippines (PAP), the Centre for Family Ministries (CEFAM) of the Society of Jesus and the psychology departments of Catholic schools such as Miriam College, De La Salle University, and the Ateneo de Manila.\n\nEach uses Church volunteers and involves others in the community in various program components, including representatives of other faiths.\n\nA typical rehabilitation program has three components: patient care, family care, and community care. Patient care is directed toward healing the individual drug user and equipping him or her with life and livelihood skills. Family care includes counselling for families of drug users, food subsidies while they attend the programs, subsidies for the children’s education, and livelihood training. Community care tries to organize and strengthen the community against the drug trade, in collaboration with the local government unit (LGU) and the police.\n\nCulture of Human Rights\n\nA second kind of preventive intervention .that the Church has initiated hopes to strengthen the defense and the culture of human rights. Bishop David is working for the establishment of human rights councils for the cities of his diocese.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Manila’s Public Affairs Ministry is working with the Commission on Human Rights on an education program for schools, parishes, and urban poor organizations, including the production of videos on various aspects of human rights. The Ministry’s director, Fr. Atilano G. Fajardo, is quick to point out that the problem is not with people unaware of their rights, but with human rights violators.\n\nThe Church is also supporting families of the slain – or as Fr. Antonio Labiao, Vicar-General of the Diocese of Novaliches, calls them, ‘orphaned families’. Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo points out that with thousands killed, there must be tens of thousands of bereaved. Their needs are numerous: for trauma debriefing and counselling, funeral expenses, food and other basic expenses, livelihood, scholarships and school expenses for orphaned children, legal aid if they wish to file cases, sanctuary and resettlement when threatened by the killers or fearful they will be ‘next’.Among the first Catholics to respond to the needs of orphaned families were the Redemptorist priests of Our Mother of Perpetual Help in Baclaran, in the Diocese of Paranaque. They have created occasional income opportunities for family members who participate in the development and maintenance of a public exhibit on the killings.\n\nPrayer for the dead\n\nA fourth intervention is the prayerful or liturgical commemoration of the dead. This commemoration aims not only to give comfort to the families but also to keep alive public awareness of the killings, to cultivate compassion for the victims and their families; and to send the message that the killings are not exempt from moral judgment. The Mass, celebrated by Bishop Pabillo and by Fr. Fajardo, was well attended by representatives of religious congregations, students of religious-run schools, and individual Catholics. Orphaned families had also been invited, but were too frightened then to go public.\n\nMore successful at gathering the orphaned families was a Mass organized by HEMA at Our Lady of Victory Church in Malabon on 2 February. Although the presider was Bishop Deogracias Iniguez, emeritus of Caloocan, it was the bereaved who spoke during the time of the homily, telling their stories to an audience of human rights advocates, religious, and other concerned Catholics. This was followed by a Mass on 2 March at the National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help in Baclaran, and another on 2 April at Sto. Nino Church in Baran-gay Bagong Silang in Novaliches, where at that time the death toll had hit 250. Bishop Antonio Tobias of the Diocese of Novaliches presided over that Mass and delivered a moving homily on the raising of Lazarus. The next day the bishop went to the police station to confront the police. For weeks after that, says Fr. Sarabia, no one was killed. On the second of each month a memorial Mass is held with the bereaved families.\n\nDocumenting the killings\n\nA fifth intervention is advocacy. The Redemptorists of Baclaran have set up a memorial exhibit to the killings at their well attended Church, reminding their millions of devotees that true faith demands compassion, denunciation, and action.\n\nChurches all over the Archdiocese of Manila and in other places have put up tarpaulins reminding the faithful that Huwag kang papatay (‘Thou shalt not kill’) has not been struck from the Ten Commandments.\n\nA final intervention is an investment in the nation’s future. At least one diocese is systematically documenting the killings. The documentation will serve as a dossier which can be eventually used to measure the extent of the slaughter, to file cases against the perpetrators, and to hold those responsible to account.\n\nCatholics who are fighting the Duterte administration’s anti-life solutions to crime may be a minority now, but they are a powerful minority. Their power comes from moral clarity and compassion, from the support of bishops, from their occupation of strategic institutional spaces in the Church, and from their capacity to work with secular groups to advocate for life and to aid the bereaved.\n\nElenor R.Dioniso\n\nThe Message for the World Day of Peace is a reminder that the efforts for intelligent solidarity are the sole antidote, and that “the realism required of international politics” must “avoid surrendering to cynicism and to the globalization of indifference”\n\n“Some consider this [global migrations] a threat. For my part, I ask you to view it with confidence as an opportunity to build peace.” Notwithstanding the analyses, the proposals, and the inspiration for reflection contained in Pope Francis’ Message for the 51st World Day of Peace, the beating heart of his appeal is encompassed in a clearly evangelical phrase, shaped on the prophetic word of Jesus of Nazareth: “You have heard that it was said …. Truly I tell you!” (Cf. Mt 5:21 et seq.).\n\nSome consider migrations a “threat”, Pope Francis urges us to consider them an “opportunity”. Far from being a rhetorical appeal, it is based on a truly global understanding of world developments, of the phenomena we are able to tackle and which deadlocks we risk incurring in.\n\nIt requires transforming our gaze, adopting the contemplative vision that is anchored to the harsh reality of everyday life and that embraces it with the same eyes of the Creator who conceived life in abundance for all human beings He created in His image and likeness. In fact, at a superficial glance the migrants – refugees in particular – seem to be linked to peace merely by reason of the war that forces them to flee their lands and their homes.\n\nBut “peace” is not only the absence of lethal weapons: it’s a dignified life, hope in a better future, skies open to the horizon of an individual and of his dear ones, especially of the weakest and defenceless ones among them.\n\nOnly a “contemplative gaze”, one that penetrates the suffering human heart, guides determined, wise, responsible and intelligent deeds. Only in-depth discernment enables everyone – starting with those responsible for the public good at national and global level – to take action according to the “four mileposts” indicated by the Pontiff: “to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate.” Other verbs could come to our minds but these four are addressed to “migrants”, those living human persons with a baggage of suffering and dignity who yearn to be recognised as such and to be welcomed, protected, promoted, integrated as such.\n\nOnly in these terms will it be possible to cast off the deceitful and self-justifying division separating those fleeing war and those fleeing hunger or environmental disasters. Indeed, macrothymia, “thinking big”, “foresight”, enables us to embrace the complexities of life and to grasp and pursue pathways of non-obvious solutions.\n\nThis passionate and com-passionate gaze –belonging to those who are compassionate and to those who suffer – underlies Pope Francis’ bold proposal for “two international compacts, one for safe, orderly and regular migration and the other for refugees”, to be drafted and approved by the United Nations: Safe, not deadly migrations; orderly, not chaotic; regular, not controlled by traffickers in human beings.\n\nThe compacts, writes the Pope, “need to be inspired by compassion, foresight and courage, so as to take advantage of every opportunity to advance the peace-building process.” Only courage can transform potential threats into opportunities, into propitious occasions to make a leap forward on the path of humanization. This will require a tenacious, persevering determination to seek and pursue the common good and not particular interests – including those that place a part of a world against the other – but the Message of the World Day of Peace is a reminder that only the struggles for intelligent solidarity ensure that “the realism required of international politics avoid surrendering to cynicism and to the globalization of indifference.”\n\nCynicism and indifference can and must be combated by each one of us day by day, thus receiving from the smallest and defenceless ones among us the great gift of recovered humanity.\n\nFather Enzo Bianchi,\n\nThe Abbot of the Bose Monastery (Italy)\n\nGeneral Elections in Egypt, Sierra Leone, Mali, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo. Possible political instability in South Africa. Crucial year in Gabon.\n\nIn North Africa, one of the main challenges is the improvement of the situation in war-torn Libya and more particularly of the situation of the Sub-Saharan migrants who are victims of the slave trade. During 2018, should be implemented a plan launched at the Abidjan EU-Africa summit of the last 29 and 30 November by the European and African Unions and by the U.N. to improve the conditions of migrants and refugees in Libya, to provide them with the appropriate assistance and to facilitate their voluntary repatriation to their countries of origin, as well as durable solutions for refugees.\n\nIn Egypt, everyone is focused on the presidential election, scheduled for March or April. The final list of candidates is expected to be published in February 2018. Former Egyptian Prime Minister an ex-air force pilot Ahmed Shafiq, said by last November he planned to run. But there is no certainty, he will be allowed to do so since his hosts, in the United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Egypt, have barred him from traveling. In such circumstances, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who is expected to seek a second term is considered as the likely winner, by all pundits.\n\nThe first local elections since the Jasmin Revolution of 2011, should take place in Tunisia on the 25 March 2018. This is a much awaited event since the town councils were dissolved in 2011 and were replaced by provisional “special delegations” which faced difficulties to manage the main cities of the country, as showed problems in the collection of wastes and deficient infrastructures.\n\nThe first scheduled event of the year in Morocco will be the African Nations Championship (CHAN 2018) which will take place between the 12th January and the 4th February. Morocco was a last minute’s choice after the Confederation of African Football, the governing body for soccer in Africa, voted unanimously to award to the Kingdom the tournament, after it confirmed it would be stripping Kenya of the tournament ‘in light of accumulated delays from reports of the various inspection missions conducted in the country.’\n\nIn neighbouring Algeria, everyone is expecting President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s announcement that he will run again in 2019, despite his uncertain health condition. Preliminary indications have been given in late 2017, that such should be the scenario, with Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia’s statement that he would support President Bouteflika if the latter wants to run for a fifth term.\n\nIn West-Africa, Sierra Leone, general elections will be held on the 7 March 2018 to elect the President, the Parliament and local councils. The three major presidential candidates in the 2018 are current foreign minister Samura Kamara who is the ruling All People’s Congress party candidate, former Sierra Leone military Junta ruler retired Brigadier Julius Maada Bio, who is the candidate of the main opposition Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP) and former United Nations senior official Kandeh Yumkella, who is the candidate of the newly formed National Grand Coalition (NGC), formed by disgruntled SLPP former members. One problem is that the election falls outside of the five-year term plus three months limit.\n\nElections are also scheduled in Mali where the jihadist threat and the separatist movement which struggles for the liberation of the northern Azawad territory are still very present. The presidential election should take place in July and the parliament elections are due in November. The suspense there is, whether the incumbent President, Ibrahim Boubacar Kéita who scored 77.6% in 2013 will be re-elected or not. Over the last months, a number of his allies have defected.\n\nIn Guinea-Conakry, local elections are scheduled on the 4 February 2018. They should have been organised in February 2017 but they were postponed, fuelling the anger of the opposition which still demonstrated in September 2017 to urge the Electoral Commission and the government to make the necessary steps to hold these elections. These are likely to take place in a tense situation. During the last quarter of 2017, there were violent demonstrations in Boké, in Western Guinea, where the inhabitants protested against power cuts.\n\nIn Eastern Africa, the main event on the agenda is the parliament election next February in Djibouti, which President Ismail Omar Guelleh’s party is likely to win, largely because of the divisions on the opposition side.In Central Africa, parliament and presidential elections are scheduled for the second half of 2018 in Cameroon. By end 2017, ten candidates announced that they would run, including former barrister Akéré Muna and Bernard Ndjonga, who is supported by small farmers associations. The opposition Social Democratic Front is also expected to present one candidate, either its historical leader John Fru Ndi, or the party’s vice-president, Joshua Osih.\n\nEveryone expects 84 years old President Paul Biya to run for another term. The big suspense is, whether or not, the elections can take place in the English-speaking Western part of the country where authorities imposed a curfew in October. The region has become the stage of a cycle of violence and repression, opposing pro-independence activists and the military. It should be also difficult to hold elections in Northern Cameroon, where Boko Haram militants are still active.\n\nThe year 2018 will be crucial in neighbouring Gabon, where parliament elections are due in April. In principle, they should have taken place in December 2016, but they had to be postponed, owing to the tense situation that followed the controversial presidential election, which President Ali Bongo’s rival, Jean Ping, described as rigged. There are still clouds on the horizon however. Opposition politicians including Dieudonné Minlama Mintogo are sceptical about the possibilities to organise free and fair elections by April. Several electoral reforms must indeed be implemented beforehand, including a reform of the constitution and of the electoral law, the appointment of an independent electoral commission and the registration of the voters, in little more than three months.\n\nIn the DRC, the main issue will be whether the legislative and presidential elections, which were scheduled by the constitution for end 2016, will take place on the 23 December 2018 as announced in November 2017 by the Independent National Electoral Commission. This is the second postponement of the elections which were due to be held by end 2017, according to an agreement sealed by the government and the opposition under the aegis of the Roman Catholic episcopal conference.\n\nThe opposition does not believe that President Joseph Kabila genuinely wants to hold them since he is not allowed to run for a third term by the constitution. So far, he has declined to state that he will not run, despite Congolese bishops’ requests.\n\nIn Burundi, the main issue will be the consequence of the International Criminal Court’s decision to open a preliminary investigation for crimes against humanity committed since April 2015 by rebels, members of the presidential party Imbonerakure militias and by state agents. The list includes the killing of more than one thousand people, illegal detentions, tortures of thousands of citizens and the displacement of 413,000 refugees. The question is whether the investigation can make progress in a country which withdrew from the ICC in October 2017.\n\nThere is also concern about possible political instability in South Africa. President Jacob Zuma, who is facing charges for corruption, might indeed have to resign before the official end of his mandate in late 2019. The succession war is raging within the ANC between Zuma’s ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamani Zuma, who has the support of her ex-husband and ex-trade unionist, Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nFrançois Misser\n\nIndigenous Africa offers examples of alternative ways to reach peace. It is the way of truth, social forgiveness, and integration. A reflection from Laurenti Magesa, a Tanzanian theologian.\n\nPeace does not mean the absence of conflict. Except in fables, recorded history offers no credible examples of societies that led perpetual, totally idyllic, tension-free existences, either internally within themselves or in relation to their neighbours.\n\nConflict is part of human nature. It arises from such emotions as selfishness, anger, revenge and desire for power and control. Every person and society somehow shares in some of these conditions. To transcend conflict constitutes the call to peace and security. But this is not an automatic endeavour. Peace must be constructed on an on-going basis at various levels of society through deliberate procedures.\n\nThe question is therefore how, in any given situation, can individuals and communities consciously manage conflict situations that are bound to arise in relationships so that differences do not degenerate into violence? How can human beings contain destructive passions that, in the absence of processes of self and social control, inevitably lead to bloodshed? More positively, how can people transform negative emotions into positive attitudes of forgiveness, concern and care for one another?\n\nThere have been several approaches to these perennial questions. Some people and societies still advocate physical force as a way of ‘solving’ conflict situations. This approach is expressed in such philosophies as, ‘If you want peace, prepare for war’ (by the 4th century Roman Publius Flavius Renatus), or ‘Peace can be achieved only by the edge of the sword’, (a maxim of the Swahili people of East Africa). This conviction has formed the dominant stuff of global history. Yet history also shows that the approach has never succeeded in fostering lasting peace.\n\nIn the 20th century alone, the world witnessed two major wars. The first (1914-1918) was touted as ‘the war to end all wars’. It did not happen. Soon afterwards, another major global confrontation occurred (1939-1945). Since then, numerous regional and civil wars have created only resentment and desire for revenge between combatants. Nations have, therefore, resorted to manufacturing weapons of mass destruction, ostensibly ‘to keep peace’ by threatening to wipe out the ‘enemy’. But the arms race has not brought the world any nearer to real peace. On the contrary, it has resulted in such horrors as the atomic bomb strikes against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, eventually killing over 200,000 people and, currently, the atrocities in Syria and elsewhere. Thus, the arms race should be described as a form of ‘balance of terror’ where violence is prevented only by ‘fear of mutual annihilation’.\n\nSolidarity as a dynamic spiritual force\n\nThough dominant, violence is nonetheless not the only way towards the management of conflict for the sake of peace. Indigenous Africa offers examples of alternative ways towards this goal and at a much deeper, more permanent level. It is the way of truth, social forgiveness, and integration. The method is intended to lead to human solidarity as the ultimate goal. True peace, in this perspective, comes only through the activation of these combined processes, step by step. Solidarity as a dynamic spiritual force is meant to create all-embracing common interests through the formation of communion of mind and heart between and among previously antagonistic perspectives.\n\nEstablishing the relative truth of a conflict situation is a prerequisite of the process. The goal here is to establish accountability for a ‘mistake or crime committed, whether pre-meditated or accidental.\n\nAdmission of a mistake, from the least, such as disrespect, to the gravest, such as murder, happens either by ordinary procedures (voluntary confession) or by supernatural means (divination). It helps the perpetrator to ‘see’ with the eyes, mind and heart the problem created and resolve not to commit further errors.\n\nConfession is necessary because harmony can be rebuilt only if moral responsibility and accountability for breach of social order are accepted. The parties in a situation of conflict must be made to understand that things are not as they should be, and that this affects not only their lives but extends to disturb the entire existence of society by causing physical, moral and spiritual disharmony, an enemy of life, since everything is connected for better or worse.\n\nFor life to continue, disorder must be healed, and healing comes through confession and forgiveness. These are demonstrated through established signs, symbols and rituals. The structure of forgiveness usually calls for an offer of compensation to the victim as a sign of repentance on the side of the wrongdoer. Reparation (often symbolic) also serves as a symbol of readiness to re-establish broken harmony and order.Archbishop John Baptist Odama affirms with reference to the Mato Oput ritual among the Acholi of Uganda, for example, that when an offender demonstrates genuine repentance, the offended “would have no option but to forgive in good faith”. A symbol of repentance must not be rejected at the risk of reversing responsibility for chaos from the original offender to the recalcitrant victim.\n\nRituals of reconciliation are here not intended for retribution but for the desired creation – on a permanent basis – of unity, harmony and solidarity. For this is what peace is understood to be. Anything less is a failure in reconciliation. For successful conflict resolution and peace, rituals must see to it that the offender is re-integrated into harmonious relationships as was the case before their breakdown so that together again the life of the community in question is stronger. All rituals are intended to say one thing to all parties concerned: “we are one community”, and if so, no one should harm oneself.\n\nAgain, awareness of this fact by all concerned constitutes the concept of peace in indigenous Africa. Being on constant watch to preserve the ritually re-established social harmony is the duty of everyone in the community. Any intention, word of deed that leads yet again to the breach of solidarity becomes both criminal and blasphemous.\n\nIntegration implies total, unreserved acceptance of the other, without suspicion or fear of their intentions. That is why this ultimate goal is invariably sealed by a ritual meal and/or drink by everyone collectively. Only people brought together by bonds of mutual love, understanding and respect, who are, therefore ‘relatives and friends’, do share meals in indigenous Africa. The act indicates purity of intention towards one another. Eating with enemies cannot happen while the hostility lasts because it can be dangerous to life; but sharing a meal, the source of life’s sustenance, is life itself.\n\nTheological validation\n\nThe road towards sincere Christian social and spiritual reconciliation and peace follows exactly the same logic. If, as James writes in his Epistle, the cause of fights and quarrels among people are their internal desires that are not properly managed (James 4:1-2), then this fact needs to be acknowledged and deliberate action taken to prevent murderous violence from ensuing. From scriptural teaching, peace is a question of practical, existential spirituality where the attitude of forgiveness and acceptance is indispensable (e.g., Mt. 5:39-48, 18:21-22, Lk. 6:29-30). After all, mercy is what God continually shows toward errant humanity, constantly inviting human beings to communion with God.\n\nFor Catholic Christians, the supreme symbol of integration into divinity is the Eucharist, in other words, the Christian Mato Oput ritual. Holy Communion is holy precisely because it is compassionate, integrative and unitive. The Eucharistic ritual is not a naive exercise but truly the way to genuine and lasting peace with God and neighbour.\n\nPeace is achieved through awareness and acknowledgment of the truth of conflict, readiness to ask, give and receive forgiveness, and genuine integration of the repentant other into the integrity of ‘human’ togetherness. African indigenous reconciliation perceptions and rituals provide a window towards global peace understood and not merely absence of war."
