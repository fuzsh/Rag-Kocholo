        "text": "Uruguay issued two updated banknotes\n\nOn 24 January 2018 the Banco Central del Uruguay has issued two updated banknotes.\n\nThe notes of 100-pesos (Series G) and 1,000-pesos (Series E) have been updated with the same security features as the 200- and 2,000-pesos notes which were updated last year.\n\nSão Tomé e Príncipe issues new banknote series\n\nAs announced last year the Banco Central de Sao Tome e Principe has issued 6 new banknotes on 1 January 2018. The banknotes are of 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, 100- and 200-dobras. All banknotes have been designed and produced by De la Rue\n\nFrom the press release by De la Rue: \"The new notes celebrate wildlife endemic São Tomé e Príncipe, and include innovative features to make them secure against counterfeiting.\n\nThe top four note values showcase a range of security features including De La Rue’s globally renowned Depth ™ Image Hologram and StarChrome® Colour Shift Thread.\n\nThe two lowest note values, 5 and 10 Dobras are on De La Rue’s Safeguard® polymer material, making them very durable whilst ensuring they are highly counterfeit resistant.\"\n\nI think this new series is beautiful and really fits in the numismatic history of the country which has produced some beautiful banknotes in the past.\n\nA Euro banknote that actually looks desirable?\n\nA lot of countries are issuing commemorative banknotes celebrating numerous occasions. The European Central Bank (ECB) hasn't issued a single commemorative note yet and (as far as we know) has no intention to do so stating it's to expensive and doens't belong in a modern currency system. Also: any celebration of an historic occasion of a European country is bound to piss off another (neighboring) country I guess.\n\nBut Numismag has photos of a special commemorative banknote printed by a Euro nation. After the German elections of 24 September 2017 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble retired at the age of 75 from politics and government. Out of the many gifts offered to him by the various European Banks and governments, the gift from the National Bank of Slovakia stands out.\n\nIt is a commemorative (fantasy) banknote of 100 euro with the face of Wolfgang Schäuble on the front. The note has been specially printed for the National Bank of Slovakia possibly by the Bundesdruckrei, the German central bank printing works. This gift was presented in the form of a bundle of several banknotes, in a box.\n\nI really hope the ECB will one day reconsider its position on commemorative banknotes because if this can be the result, I can still dream of one day having an actual attractive looking Euro banknote in my pocket.\n\nCabo Verde retires two banknotes\n\nThe Central Bank of Cape Verde has issued a press release stating the banknotes of 200 escudos dated 2005 and 2,000 escudos dated 1999 will be withdrawn from circulation from 17 November 2017.\n\nThe notes can be redeemed at the main office until 16 November 2027.\n\nScottish 10-pound notes auctioned for a lot of money\n\nThe Bank of Scotland issued a new 10-pound note in the Autumn of 2017. The note featured a portrait of the Scottish novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott on the front together with an image of The Mound, the historic head office of the Bank of Scotland. The back of the note shows the Glenfinnan Viaduct (even more famous after it was pictured in the Harry Potter movies) with a steam locomotive hauling a heritage tourist train. The locomotive is a preserved Stanier \"Black 5\", which was designed for the London, Midland and Scottish railway and is often seen on the West Highland line.\n\nFrom Banknotenews.com: \"On 1 December 2017, Spink concluded an auction of new Bank of Scotland 10-pound notes to raise money for the charity Mental Health UK. There were two notes with special 8-character serial numbers chosen by the winning bidders, plus 36 other notes with prefixes and serial numbers designed to appeal to railroad enthusiasts. 18 notes each with BR (British Railway) and LMS (London Midland Scotland) prefixes were sold with serial numbers corresponding to the number on each of the Stanier Black 5 locomotives in preservation today. The LMS notes also feature an overprinted “totem” sign at upper left back corresponding to a station: Ardlui, Arrochar And Tarbet, Banavie, Bridge Of Orchy, Corrour, Crianlarich Upper, Fort William, Garelochhead, Glenfinnan, Helensburgh-Upper, Lochailort, Locheilside, Morar, Rannoch, Roy Bridge, Spean Bridge, Tulloch, and Tyndrum Upper.\"\n\nThe notes sold for prices ranging from 250 to nearly 4,000 pound. The auction was interesting for collectors of banknotes and for train enthusiasts.\n\nIt was especially interesting if you want to spend a lot of money on a note with an arbitrary serial number. But that may just be me talking as I don't share the same enthusiasm for 'special' serial numbers as some collectors do.\n\nUkraine issues commemorative souvenir note\n\nAs announced in November 2017 the National Bank of Ukraine has issued a souvenir commemorative banknote. Souvenir indeed because it's not legal tender. The banknote commemorates the 100th Anniversary of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917 and the first Ukrainian banknote. It's a reproduction of the first Ukrainian note of 100 karvobanetz and measures 170 x 80mm.\n\nImages from banknotenews.com.\n\nSolomon Islands introduce first gold coin note\n\nThe Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) has introduced the world’s first ever legal tender gold coin note. This extremely thin coin note is produced in 0.5g fine .999 gold and is measured at 90 x 43 mm. The making of this gold coin note renders the product as very delicate in appearance. This project involves CBSI and the World Coin Association and MDM Group, a company based in Germany who have been in the numismatic business for more than 100 years.\n\nEach coin note is professionally packed and set in a protective clear square capsule. At the moment the maximum mintage is limited to 20,000 pieces only. In terms of the design, on the back of the note, the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II is depicted in profile and is framed by graphic elements. The front of the note features symbols of the most important world currencies, rotating around planet Earth. In the background, symbols of the financial world are displayed. The note can be purchased for an estimated $20 from the CBSI.\n\nNow the important question which has been a topic on the IBNS forum: could this be considered a real banknote or should this 'note' be seen as a purely numismatic product? I'm leaning towards the latter (certainly after reading the press release carefully) but that doesn't mean one should avoid this gold piece. I personally will pass on it but if you like it: go for it.\n\nTwo fantasy additions to the current Madagascar series\n\nLast year Madagascar introduced a new series of banknotes. The highest denomination is the 20,000-ariary at this moment.\n\nBut if they ever have to issue higher denominations, perhaps they can use these fantasy notes Jérémy Pureur has created. They would fit perfectly in the current series. Impressive work!\n\nSouth Korea issues Olympic banknote\n\nThe Bank of Korea announced in May of this year that in commemoration of the Winter Olympics 2018 which will be held in Pyeongchang from 9 - 25 February 2018 a special banknote would be issued. South Korea follows in the footsteps of China and Russia who also issued special commemorative banknotes celebrating their Olympic games of 2008 and 2014.\n\n\"The commemorative note is 140 millimeters wide and 75 millimeters long. The front of the note will feature athletes engaging in seven of the key winter sports events -- speed skating, ski jumping, ice hockey, curling, biathlon, bobsleigh and luge. The other side portrays a tiger and a pine tree, both believed to symbolize the nation, as in the famous “Songhamaenghodo(...)” painting by a leading painter from the Joseon-era, Kim Hong-do (1745-1806 (...)), who went by the pen name Danwon (...).\"\n\nThe note was introduced from 11 December 2017 when the Bank of Korea issued 2.8 million 2,000-won notes. The notes are not intended for circulation so individual notes were packaged in a folder and sold for 8,000 won each. The bank also sold uncut pairs and sheets of 24 notes. As one might expect: they were sold out very quick but can be found online, for instance on eBay.\n\nAlgeria replaces all circulating banknotes in 2018\n\nThe Banque d'Algérie has announced that by the end of 2018 all currently circulating banknotes will be replaced by a whole new series.\n\nThe new notes will have no pictures of animals and will be printed on a better (probably hybrid) substrate and have advanced security features. This measure will allow the authorities to recover the money supply in the informal market, which is the cause of the lack of liquidity in the banks, which has forced the authorities to switch to non-conventional financing.\n\nThe government plans to replace current notes in a gradual fashion, issuing first the denominations of 200 and 500 dinars. If no problems arise, it will continue with the notes of 1,000 and 2,000 dinars before the end of 2018.\n\nUpdate 26-01-2018: However, ObservAlgerie.com reports that the Central Bank will replace the 500-dinar note with a coin. They also state that the possibility of a new 5,000-dinar banknote is being discussed.\n\nthe tickets currently in circulation will be withdrawn and replaced at the end of the year 2018. According to Ennahar, there will be no pictures of the animals on the new, this would even be the reason for the withdrawal of the current tickets.\n\nThis measure, decided by Ahmed Ouyahia's executive, will allow the authorities to recover the money supply in the informal market, which is the cause of the lack of liquidity in the banks, which has forced the authorities to switch to non-conventional financing.\n\nRomania modifies the coat of arms on new banknotes\n\nThe Banca Nationala a Romaniei will issue new banknotes and coins with a modified coat of arms. In the new coat of arms the eagle will be crowned.\n\nThe new notes are dated 1 January 2018 and will also be issued from that date at the moment new notes are necessary. Older notes will co-circulate.\n\nThe rest of the design as well as the security features will stay the same.\n\nTunisia issues new 20-dinar note\n\nThe Central Bank of Tunisia has issued its new banknote of 20 dinar. Noureddine Taboubi, General Secretary of the Tunisian General Labour Union, announced the new 20-dinar banknote last month.\n\nThe new note measures 153 mm x 76 mm. The front shows the portrait of trade union leader Farhat Hached, who was assassinated in 1952 by the terrorist group \"La Main Rouge\". This organization was operated by the foreign Department of the French External Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service.\n\nThe back of the note shows a partial view of the amphitheatre of El Jem, in the center a panoramic view of this monument and below, in the foreground, a Corinthian capital of the same monument. More info on all the security features can be found here.\n\nSri Lanka is printing commemorative notes\n\nThe Central Bank of Sri Lanka will issue special commemorative notes this year. From the Daily Mirror in Sri Lanka:\n\n\"Several denominations of new currency notes are to be issued to mark the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka’s independence next year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.\n\nPrime Minister Wickremesinghe revealed this during his visit to De La Rue Lanka Currency and Security Print (Private Ltd) in Biyagama yesterday. The company holds the rights to print currency for the Government of Sri Lanka as well as several foreign governments.\n\n\"You were denied access to the premises of this company because several new bank notes that are to be issued to mark the 70th anniversary of Sri Lanka’s independence are being printed here.\"\"\n\nSri Lanka's Independence Day is celebrated on 4 February 2018 so perhaps we will see the new notes very soon.\n\nMalaysia announces commemorative notes\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will issue commemorative banknotes in conjunction with the 60th Anniversary of the Signing of the Federation of Malaya Independence Agreement.\n\n\"These banknotes commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Federation of Malaya Independence Agreement signing in the year 1957. The commemorative banknotes honour the Council (later called Conference) of Rulers’ contribution towards the realisation of the Nation’s independence on 31 August 1957. The Agreement dated 5 August 1957 proclaiming the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the Supreme Head of the Federation was signed by the Malay Council of Rulers from Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor and Terengganu with Sir Donald MacGillivray, the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya who represented Queen Elizabeth II. The Agreement became a historical constitutional evidence for the independence of the Federation of Malaya.\"\n\nThere will be 3 varieties available:\n\nSingle 600-ringgit banknote: this large-sized banknote has a face value of 600 ringgit and will be sold at 1,700 ringgit a piece. The printed quantity is 6,000 pieces.

These commemorative banknotes are the first commemorative banknotes printed by Bank Negara Malaysia on the composite substrate, a combination of polymer and paper substrate, which offers higher security features and longer life span. These banknotes are printed larger in size, based on its face value.\n\nSymbolising Malaysia as a constitutional monarchy, placed in the middle is the majestic royal throne encircled by the portraits of 15 Yang di-Pertuan Agong who have reigned from 1957 till the present day. The obverse design is inspired by the crescent and a 14-pointed federal star which are featured on the royal headgear.\n\nThe reverse design features the portraits of the nine rulers signing the Federation of Malaya Independence Agreement on 5 August 1957. These banknotes are decorated with prominent independence and post-independence figures and features. On the right-hand side of the banknote is the triumphant silhouette of Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, the architect of Malayan independence and the first Prime Minister of Malaysia. Imprinted on the background are four significant landmarks: the National Palace, Perdana Putra, the Parliament building and the Palace of Justice. These reflect the four pillars of the nation: the institution of the Monarchy, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary respectively.\n\nTo provide a fair opportunity for the public to buy these limited edition banknotes, there will be a purchase limit (a piece of RM600, a set of Uncut 3-in-1 RM60 and five pieces of RM60 banknotes per person).
