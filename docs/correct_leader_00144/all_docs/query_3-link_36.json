        "text": "Former Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia was questioned by a court in Algiers on Sunday over a graft case that involves German auto giant Volkwagen's local partner, Algerian media reported.\n\nOuyahia was detained on Wednesday on the orders of the investigating judge at the Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier in the day, former Finance Minister Karim Djoudi was ordered before the Supreme Court to face questions over the same scandal.\n\nA criminal case has been opened against the head of Algeria's SOVAC Group, a family-owned firm that runs an assembly plant with VW. CEO Mourad Eulmi and his brother have been accused of \"receiving unjustified benefits\" through government contracts.\n\nThe ex-prime minister and the ex-finance minister are the latest senior figures associated with former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to face investigations since angry protests broke out earlier this year demanding the departure of the ruling elite.\n\nAfter 20 years in power, Bouteflika stepped down in April on orders from the army.\n\nHe is accused of years of mismanagement and corruption of the North African country.\n\nArmy chief of staff Ahmed Gaed Salah has since urged the judiciary to speed up the prosecution of people suspected of involvement in corruption cases.\n\nOther prominent figures under investigation include former energy minister Chakib Khelil, Bouteflika's younger brother Said and several prominent businessmen.\n\nThe presidential election previously planned for July 4 has been postponed, with no new date set for the vote.\n\nmm/jm (Reuters)"
