Netanyahu and Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis announced on 3 October the winners of the fifth Eric and Sheila Samson Prime Minister’s Prize for Innovation in Alternative Fuels for Transportation: Professor Jens Nielsen of Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and Professor Jean-Marie Tarascon of the Collège de France in Paris.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s Prize for Innovation in Alternative Fuels for Transportation is the largest monetary prize for alternative energy research in the world. Each recipient is awarded $1 million. Winners are recommended by an international committee and approved by a panel. The prize is part of a government plan that seeks to have all transportation in Israel running on alternative fuels by 2025, reducing the amount of oil-dependent transportation in the country as well as oil dependency throughout the world.\n\nNielsen has developed next-generation fuel sources that are more efficient than ethanol, including a species of bacteria that creates fatty acids that are efficient fuel sources for aircraft. He has also proved that giving up bio-ethanol for advanced biofuels can significantly reduce the production of greenhouse gases. Tarascon is a leading figure in the field of batteries and storing electrical energy. His work stresses the discovery of new materials to reduce energy transfer loss with the goal of developing high-performance batteries for electric cars. The batteries in Renault-Nissan electric vehicles are based on Tarascon’s discoveries.\n\nThe prize will be awarded on 31 October at an international conference on alternative fuel sources.

The energy ministry said Abu Dhabi’s Masdar and Electricité de France bid to supply power from a 300-megawatt photovoltaic plant for as little as 1.79 cents. If awarded, that would beat the previous record for a solar project in Abu Dhabi for 2.42 cents a kilowatt-hour.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its neighbors are among Middle Eastern oil producers looking to renewables to feed growing domestic consumption that’s soaking up crude they’d rather export to generate income. While the offers submitted are remarkably low, the actual cost of power coming from the projects may be inflated by terms within the contracts that aren’t yet published, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance in Zurich. Saudi Arabia’s price may reflect a “base rate” paid at periods of peak demand or a price that applies only for part of the project’s life. It also could include a payment to the winning developer, land grants or other incentives to get the solar industry started in Saudi Arabia.\n\nEven so, the announcement is a milestone in Saudi Arabia’s nascent solar program. The country that gets less than 1% of its power from renewables currently plans to develop 30 solar and wind projects over the next 10 years. The plant will be the first awarded under the renewables program, which targets 9,500 megawatts of electricity generation capacity using solar and wind by 2030. The project is set to start producing power by June 2019, according to the bid.

The Kingdom achieved a rating of 7.47 out of 10 in the EFW index, which ranks a total of 159 countries to analyze the impact of cross-country differences in economic freedom and freedom variations across three decades. In an interview with The Jordan Times, economist Zayyan Zawaneh said such a high ranking “is a reflection of how Jordan has been following the path to the free economy since the fifties, when many other countries in the region shifted to socialist and Marxist systems….However, over the past 20 years, this free economy has not been reflected positively on the situation of the Jordanian people and on the overall economy,” he stressed.\n\nThe EFW index measures the degree to which national policies and institutions are supportive of economic freedom, highlighting personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to enter markets and compete and security of the person and privately owned property as the cornerstones of this freedom. A total of 42 data points were used to construct the general summary index, and to measure the degree of economic freedom in five specific areas. In this regard, Jordan achieved 7.38 points out of 10 in the “size of the government” area, 4.76 in “legal system and property rights”, 9.6 in “sound money”, 7.63 in “freedom to trade internationally”, and 7.92 in “regulation”.

The study recommends that the government revisits its commitment to the IMF’s program in the upcoming phases. Alternatively, the government should explore other means to push for economic revitalization and reprioritize its legislative agendas.\n\nThe study, entitled “Analysis of IMF Programs in Jordan from 1989 to 2016”, noted that “the objectives of the fund’s programs implemented … have not been met in performance indicators”. Such KPIs include “increasing economic growth rates, reducing inflation rates and addressing chronic structural imbalances in public finances”, the study underlined. Meanwhile, it also “did not include long-term solutions and strategies.” Instead of addressing structural problems, the IMF focused on rationing the increase of rigid budget items, which have hurdled fiscal reforms in the overall. This “led to the continuation of structural problems in government spending”, as opposed to addressing them. Many of the challenges facing the recovery of Jordan’s economy are related to the refugee crisis. With the Donor Countries failing to fulfil their commitments, the crisis continues to strain Jordan’s resources and budget.

The move will suspend a trade embargo, unfreeze assets and remove financial restrictions that have hobbled the Sudanese economy.\n\nSudan’s economy has struggled since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country’s oil output, its main source of foreign currency and government income. Price rises have been compounded by the government’s decision late last year to cut fuel and electricity subsidies in a bid to tighten its finances. Petrol prices rose by about 30%, leading to broader inflation.\n\nThe United States lifted long-standing sanctions against Sudan on 6 October, saying Sudan had made progress fighting terrorism and easing humanitarian distress, and also secured Khartoum’s commitment not to pursue arms deals with North Korea. Khartoum is hopeful that the move would help it regain access to global financial markets which could help draw in badly needed investment and raise prospects for a recovery.

The IMF also lowered its projected GDP growth for Morocco for 2018 to 3%, against a forecasted 3.9% in its April report. The IMF however expects growth to pick up steadily to reach 4% in 2019 and 4.5% in 2022. With regard to the current account deficit, IMF projections forecast a decrease of 4 and 2.9% respectively in 2017 and 2018, against 2.6 and 2% forecasted in the April report. The fund also maintained its projected growth in unemployment of 9.3 and 9.5% for 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn its country report published in February 2017, the IMF noted that Morocco’s medium-term outlook remains favorable, with a rebound in growth expected by 2021. However, risks remain substantial, mainly related to growth in developed and emerging countries, geopolitical tensions in the region, global energy prices, and volatility in financial markets. Stronger growth in the medium term depends on the sustained implementation of comprehensive reforms related in particular to the efficiency and participation of the labor market, access to finance, the promotion of quality education, the efficiency of public expenditure, and the constant improvement of the business climate.

Due to its geopolitical position and expertise in the field, Morocco has established itself as a spearhead of the automotive industry on the continent, recording remarkable growth over the last ten years. Morocco is rising up among the world’s largest car manufacturers, seducing internationally renowned investors to turn to the kingdom, a platform ideally located to flood the African and European markets.\n\nBMI expects total new vehicle sales in Morocco to reach 169,298 units by the end of 2017, compared to 152,552 units in Egypt. Furthermore, BMI forecast vehicle sales in Morocco to reach a total of 249,029 units by the end of our forecast period in 2021, compared to Egypt’s total of 170,864 units. With a forecasted annual average growth rate of 8.9% over the 201-2021 period, sales of passenger cars is expected to be the leading sector with an annual growth rate of 9.1% over the same period, followed by sales of commercial cares with 5.9%, explain BMI. For the BMI, this bullish outlook is supported by Morocco’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals and the development of the local auto industry.\n\nAs for private consumption, a key indicator of potential demand for new vehicles, BMI expects an annual growth rate of 3.6% over the aforementioned period. For BMI, this growth will remain steady over the coming years, supported by strong economic growth and remittance inflows that boost household revenues. Furthermore, Morocco’s elimination of import taxes of European models and the availability of cheaper models from domestic production will play a key role in supporting the growth of the local market.\n\nFor BMI, the difficult economic conjuncture in Egypt doomed the fate of its automotive industry, sparked by political and social tensions, the impact of high inflation, elevated interest rates and fuel subsidy removals constrained consumer spending. This domino effect has in turn hindered sales of new vehicles, which according to BIM are expected to fall by 24.2% in 2017. BMI expects an exodus of international automotive makers present in Egypt to Morocco, such as BMW, General Motors Co (GM) and Hyundai.

Both countries say that the mega-project will have a positive impact on the lives of local populations in the African countries the pipeline will cross to reach Morocco.\n\nMorocco’s African policy made the kingdom a key player in the continental scene. In January Morocco made a triumphant comeback to the African Union (AU) after 34 years of absence following the admission of the Polisario Front into the organization.

A steep decline in iron ore prices in 2014/5 took away half of exports, widened the fiscal deficit, put pressure on reserves and exposed bank vulnerabilities. In response, the authorities adjusted the budget significantly in 2016 (by 3% of GDP), allowed the exchange rate to depreciate and mobilized foreign grants and loans. These efforts were successful in reducing external imbalances and maintaining macroeconomic stability, but growth slowed considerably, external debt continued to rise (to 72% of GDP, with a high risk of debt distress) and financial stability risks heightened.

But a later version said the measure “will apply to sticker visas as well as e-Visas and border visas”, leaving open the question of whether US travelers who already have visas would be allowed to enter Turkey.
