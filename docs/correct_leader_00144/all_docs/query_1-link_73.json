        "text": "The office of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced the changes as part of a Cabinet reshuffle, with outgoing Premier Abdelaziz Belkhadem returning to his previous post as the president's \"personal representative\".\n\nThe shake-up, which includes changes at the head of the transport, communication and financial reform ministries, comes during a recent resurgence in extremist violence.\n\nOne of Mr Ouyahia's first big tasks is likely to be constitutional reform, which Algeria's media have reported will be taken up sometime next month.\n\nSpeculation has been widespread in Algerian newspapers about whether President Bouteflika will seek to modify the constitution so that he can run for a third term in presidential elections next year.\n\nMr Bouteflika's health has also prompted persistent speculation ever since his hospitalisation in Paris in 2005 for what was reported to be a stomach ulcer. He spent nearly five weeks having treatment.\n\nMr Ouyahia, 56, heads one of three parties in the governing coalition. He served as premier from 1996 to 1998 and from 2003 to 2006. Mr Belkhadem, often his rival, took over after Ouyahia resigned in May 2006 in the midst of months of political pressure.\n\nIn recent months, critics, including Mr Ouyahia, accused Mr Belkhadem of overseeing a stagnant government and pandering to labour unions by agreeing in January to increase salaries of government workers.\n\nAlgeria has battled an Islamic insurgency for years, but the number of attacks has risen dramatically since the country's main militant group vowed allegiance to al-Qaida in 2006.\n\nMost of the recent bombings have been claimed by al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa, formerly known as the GSPC - a Salafist group that grew out of an insurgency that raged in the country in the 1990s."
