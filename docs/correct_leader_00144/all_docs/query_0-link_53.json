        "text": "An Algiers judge placed Noureddine Bedoui, 62, under court supervision and confiscated his passport after his detention on Sunday, but on Tuesday another court decided to detain him.\n\nBedoui briefly served as prime minister in early 2019 after being appointed to replace unpopular premier Ahmed Ouyahia as streets across Algeria were rocked by unprecedented protests against Bouteflika's bid for a fifth term in office.\n\nBut Bouteflika's moves did little to placate anger, and just three weeks later he resigned under pressure from the public and the army, bringing an end to two decades of rule.\n\nOuyahia and fellow ex-premier Abdelmalek Sellal have both been handed long prison sentences on charges of corruption under Bouteflika.\n\nBouteflika died in September at the age of 84 and was quietly buried without the honours accorded to his predecessors."
