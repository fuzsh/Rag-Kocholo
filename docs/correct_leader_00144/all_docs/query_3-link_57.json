I would also like to note that you can count on the Government of Algeria to make every possible effort to strengthen our cooperation, and implement and elaborate on the agreements you have reached with President Bouteflika during your current visit.\n\nPresident of Russia Dmitry Medvedev: Mr Prime Minister, I am certain that today’s visit will give additional impetus to the development of our cooperation.\n\nNaturally, the Government plays an important role in the development of economic ties and various business contacts. This year, we increased our turnover quite significantly, but Mr President and I noted that it still does not reflect the potential of our nations. Investment cooperation certainly needs to be strengthened. This is especially true given that our nations are strategic partners. And in this regard, the projects already implemented in Algeria and those that could still be implemented must serve as the foundation for our cooperation.\n\nI brought a fairly large delegation of businesspeople with me representing over one hundred companies. These are both large, very large international companies, and smaller ones as well. They are ready to develop economic ties with Algeria.\n\n<…>"
