        "text": "The statement, carried by the official news agency APS on Wednesday, named Abdelaziz Belkhadem, who has served as President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s personal representative and held the rank of minister, as the new prime minister.\n\nThe move was widely expected ahead of parliamentary elections next year and after Ahmed Ouyahia, the outgoing prime minister, failed to attend formal ceremonies for visiting leaders in recent days.\n\nAlgerian newspapers had predicted Ouyahia’s departure amid a political struggle between Bouteflika’s National Liberation Front (FLN) and Ouyahia’s Democratic National Rally (RND).\n\nThe FLN, which dominates the parliament, had threatened to topple Ouyahia through a no-confidence vote in parliament if he did not resign or Bouteflika did not fire him.\n\nCriticised over poverty\n\nThe FLN accuses Ouyahia of not moving fast enough to tackle social issues such as widespread unemployment and poverty.\n\nOuyahia was due this week to address parliament to defend his political record, but speaker Amar Saadani, a senior FLN official, told the daily al Khabar on Wednesday: “We see no necessity for him (Ouyahia) to come to the parliament.”\n\nAhmed Ouyahia’s departure was\n\nexpected in Algeria (file)\n\nWednesday’s statement from the president’s office did not name the outgoing premier, apparently underlining the political tension between the Bouteflika camp and Ouyahia.\n\nOuyahia had stood firm in the face of demands by politicians, media and trade unions to raise wages, arguing the economic climate was not healthy enough.\n\nCommentators said the FLN, which is also represented in the government under Ouyahia, wants to focus on social issues ahead of elections and distances itself from the previous government, criticised for failing to solve the country’s troubles despite soaring oil prices.\n\nOuyahia, 54, became the youngest Algerian prime minister when he was first appointed in 1995. He is widely respected for his management skills.\n\nHe quit late in 1998 before returning to lead the government in mid-2003 until his departure again on Wednesday.\n\nPolitical split\n\nLocal commentators said his departure heralded a split of the country’s political landscape into camps ahead of the 2007 parliamentary polls.\n\nOuyahia’s RND formed an alliance with the FLN and moderate Islamists to cement support for Bouteflika’s policy, which focuses on restoring peace after more than a decade of violence in which more than 150,000 people were killed.\n\nAlgeria plunged into violence early in 1992 when the authorities scrapped parliamentary polls that a now-banned radical Islamist party was poised to win.\n\nCommentators said the departure of Ouyahia, whose secularist views clashed with his Islamist and conservative partners in the government he led, would be a loss for the anti-Islamist camp and a gain for the conservatives who cement their alliance with moderate Islamists.\n\n“The presidential alliance is changing into a coalition between Islamists and conservatives,” said the influential el Watan daily in a commentary.\n\nBelkhadem said he was consulting other political groups to form a new government soon."
