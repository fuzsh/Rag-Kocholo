        "text": "Notes\n\nChapter 1\n\n1. Emilie Morin, “Unspeakable Tragedies: Censorship and the New Political Theatre of the Algerian War of Independence,” in Theatre and Human Rights after 1945: Things Unspeakable, ed. Mary Luckhurst and Emilie Morin (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), 21–38; El Djamhouria Slimani Aït Saada, Histoire de lieux: El Asnam, Miliana, Tenes (Algiers: Hibr Editions, 2013), 234; Brahim Ouardi, “Écriture, théâtre et engagement dans le théâtre d'Henri Kréa et Noureddine Aba,” doctoral thesis, Université de Oran (2009) pp. 75–76; “Théâtre d'Henri Kréa,” http://www.algeriades.com/henri-krea/article/theatre-d-henri-krea. The play was performed only in a reading in Paris in 1959. It was too seditious for France, and the Algerian theater after independence privileged works written in Arabic. In 1960, Kréa would become a signatory to the “Manifesto of the 121,” supporting the cause of Algerian independence.\n\n2. Henri Kréa, Le séisme: Tragédie (Paris: Pierre Jean Oswald, 1958), 9–11; Aït Saada, Histoire de lieux, 234–238. As Brahim Ouardi has pointed out, Jugartha was a mythic figure who imparts a sense of timelessness to the values communicated by the play. Brahim Ouardi, “Mythe, théâtre et oralité dans Le séisme d'Henri Kréa,” Synergies Algèrie no. 3 (2008): 212.\n\n3. Kréa, Le séisme, 19.\n\n4. Kréa, Le séisme, 82.\n\n5. Aït Saada has argued that, “For Henri Kréa, the earthquake and the war emerge from the same 'tragedy'. . . . The ravages engendered by the natural disaster or by the war, a disaster due to human stupidity [bêtise], are alike, if [the latter] is not still more senseless.” (Aït Saada, Histoire de lieux, 271). In Aït Saada's analysis, “For this poet [Henri Kréa], human savagery and the brutality of geography share the world equitably, because no God conceals himself behind these colossal manifestations” (389). However, Aït Saada's reading of Kréa is incomplete. In the context of the play as a whole, the choir's fatalistic and pessimistic conclusion might suggest ambivalence about the Algerian Revolution's prospects for success, but not about its meaningfulness or righteousness. As Brahim Ouardi has noted, the play's structure does invoke the classical Greek tragedy, with a Prologue, two Episodes, and an “Exodus,” and the projection of an image of a mask of Jugartha in the Exodus is an allusion to the use of the mask in Greek theater. However, the play does not portray the downfall of a tragic hero; instead, it communicates the righteousness of Algerian anti-colonialism and the positive transformation of characters who embrace the cause. Brahim Ouardi, “Mythe, théâtre et oralité,” 211–218.\n\n6. Kréa, Le séisme, 45.\n\n7. Krea, Le séisme, 43.\n\n8. Kréa, Le séisme, 42.\n\n9. Kréa, Le séisme, 48.\n\n10. Kréa, Le séisme, 48. Yet redemption is possible; a soldier traumatized by his role loading bombs onto aircraft to bomb villages not only repents but joins the revolutionaries.\n\n11. Kréa, Le séisme, 77.\n\n12.

In addition to these works addressing European imperialism in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, the impact of environmental disasters has also been extensively and adroitly explored in works such as Gregory Clancey, Earthquake Nation: The Cultural Politics of Japanese Seismicity, 1868-1930 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006); Sonia Ryang, “The Great Kanto Earthquake and the Massacre of Koreans in 1923: Notes on Japan's Modern National Sovereignty,” Anthropological Quarterly 76 (2003): 731–748; Charles Walker, Shaky Colonialism.: The 1746 Earthquake-Tsunami in Lima, Peru, and its Long Aftermath (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2008.)\n\n14.

As Gregory Clancey has phrased it, “We are used to the idea that accidents and disasters expose previously unimagined vulnerabilities. . . . Less self-evident is the way political actors (including scientists, architects, and other state-credentialed professionals) craft advantage from these same phenomena. How the unexpected natural disaster and the normative machinery of government intertwine, creating not only states of emergency but emergency-oriented states, is a topic we have only begun to explore despite a plethora of intriguing evidence.” Clancey, Earthquake Nation, 4.\n\n22.

Millecam, a French advocate of Algerian independence, portrayed the environmental catastrophes of his youth—a devastating flood, a cyclone—as akin to the partisan and anti-Semitic violence that wracked his hometown of Mostaganem during the Second World War. Furthermore, for Millecam, “The earlier apocalypses were preparing other, even more ghastly apocalypses: those of the war of independence. . . . The first ones opened the way for the others.” Jean-Pierre Millecam, “Apocalypses,” in An Algerian Childhood: A Collection of Autobiographical Narratives [Une enfance algérienne], ed. Leïla Sebbar, trans. Marjolijn de Jager (St. Paul: Ruminator Books, 2001), 174. Novelist Mohammed Magani saw his own task as making sense of a particular disaster—the later earthquake in Orléansville in 1980—by relating it both to the universal human condition and to the other catastrophes: to “associate it with other natural calamities and man-man disasters with a view to demonstrate the fragility of the human condition; apply it as a metaphor of psychological and material demolition (or auto-demolition),” quoted in Aït Saada, Histoire de lieux, 281. Habib Tengour and Belgacem Aït Ouyahia are discussed below, in chapters 2 and 3 (Aït Ouyahia) and 7 (both Tengour and Aït Ouyahia).\n\n35.

Kréa, like the other writers discussed in this volume, also genders the suffering of disaster survivors in ways I hope will be explored in future scholarship. In Kréa's play, the earthquake is juxtaposed to the labor pains suffered by a woman giving birth (the sister of the “Young Woman” in the play), as a sign of new life to come and also a hurdle in the fight for freedom. When Young Woman's sister dies in childbirth, and another woman dies in the earthquake, their deaths are equivalent: tragic only because they died before seeing the day of liberation.\n\n39.

On memory and histories of political (but not environmental) violence, see Ussama Makdisi and Paul Silverstein, eds, Memory and Violence in the Middle East and North Africa (Bloomington: University of Indiana Press, 2006). A landmark in the field of French memory studies is the multivolume Les lieux de mémoire, edited by Pierre Nora (Paris: Gaillimard, 1984), which, as Makdisi and Silverstein point out, moved the field beyond “the arbitrary distinction between 'history' as a universal, singular, and normative category and 'memories' as popular, disparate, and multiple,” 10. The present volume makes use of excellent studies by Claire Eldridge and M. Kathryn Edwards. Eldridge, From Empire to Exile: History and Memory within the Pied-Noir and Harki Communities, 1962-2012 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016); Edwards, Contesting Indochina: French Remembrance between Decolonization and Cold War (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2016).\n\n41.

Within the fields of memory studies and trauma studies, scholars have come to recognize that all memory—even memories of violence and injustice—should not be placed uncritically in the category of trauma. Heike Becker has discussed the implications of the “individualising and medicalizing commands of this [trauma] discourse.” Dominick LaCapra has recognized that overuse of a psychoanalytic concept of trauma runs the risk of “the pathologization of historical processes;” Roger Luckhurst has explored problematic aspects of concepts of trauma (“an exemplary conceptual knot”) in an increasingly post-Freudian intellectual landscape. Heike Becker, “Beyond Trauma: New Perspectives on the Politics of Memory in East and Southern Africa,” African Studies 70, (2011): 32; La Capra, History and Memory, 13; Luckhurst, The Trauma Question (London and New York: Taylor and Francis, 2008), 14. The present volume treats a wider range of experiences and effects of disaster than would typically be included in trauma studies: for example, the experiences and responses of those who are traumatized neither directly nor through the secondary transmission of trauma but who seize upon the disaster as an opportunity.\n\n46.

On the number of destroyed residences, see also Sous-Préfet d'Orléansville to Préfet Gromand, 20 November 1954, ANFP F/2/box 4349, folder 1. This document specifies 7,236 “houses” destroyed, and 34,792 gourbis. This conforms to the numbers given in Directeur du Service Central de Secours [Algiers], n.d. [October 1954], ANFP F/2/4349, folder “Affaires diverses.” J.P. Rothé counted 7,286 “houses” and 21,006 gourbis, but this did not include the effects of the October tremors (quoted in Hautberg, Orléansville, 52).\n\n5. I.e., “orogenic movement (Alpine folding).” Jean-Pierre Rothé, “Les tremblements de terre d'Orléansville (Septembre–Octobre 1954),” Revue pour l'étude des calamités 14, no. 32 (1955): 77–82, as abstracted in Geophysical Abstracts 163 (1955): 240. See also Hautberg, Orléansville, 49.\n\n6. J.P. Rothé reported 109 “European” dead in September (8 percent) and 1,188 Muslims (92 percent), according to Hautberg, Orléansville, 52. As Todd Shepard points out, it is important to recognize that in French Algeria “Muslim” was a legal category, and was not dependent on an individual's beliefs or practices. Shepard, The Invention of Decolonization: The Algerian War and the Remaking of France (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2006), 7. The subprefecture's November figures counted 1,240 dead for the entire arrondissement, including only forty of European origin. Sous-Préfet d'Orléansville to Préfet Gromand, November 20, 1954, ANFP F/2/4349, folder 1. A figure of 1,412 dead is given in “Compte rendu,” sent to the President of the Republic by J. Marin, September 18, 1954, ANFP F/2/4349, folder 1. While the numbers of dead may well have been much higher than official figures indicated, it was the number rendered homeless that became a point of controversy in the 1950s. An official estimate in 1954 acknowledged two hundred thousand sinistrés (victims/survivors). Directeur du Service Central de Secours [Algiers], n.d. [October 1954], ANFP F/2/4349, folder “Affaires diverses.” A dissident group, the Comité National Algérien d'Aide aux Sinistrés d'Orléansville, estimated that two hundred thirty-five thousand were affected by the earthquakes and 80 percent of them were effectively without shelter. Comité National Algérien d'Aide aux Sinistrés d'Orléansville to Minister of Interior, October 18, 1954, ANFP F/2/4349, folder “Affaires diverses.” These figures are proportional to the estimated number of homes destroyed. John Lewis has recently estimated that three hundred thousand were left homeless in 1954.

See also “Simple questions,” Alger républicain, October 2–3, 1954. As Daniel Williford has pointed out regarding the 1960 Agadir earthquake, engineering analyses tended to reach blanket conclusions about the inevitable failure of “traditional” and masonry construction, while promoting the view that “modern” reinforced concrete represented the only remedy to seismic risk, despite occasional failures. Williford argues convincingly that this unwillingness to investigate ways to make low-cost construction safer made risk mitigation a privilege for the well-off.

Though political dissidents of the nationalist and leftist varieties often undertook to speak for the disempowered, these anti-colonial voices were nevertheless those of elites, relatively speaking. The reader will note, in particular, the absence of voices from Muslim women and working-class Muslim men in the narratives presented here, an absence which I hope will be remedied in future work.\n\n12.

According to French accounts, the Saïah had long been a leading family of the nearby Medjadja people, and were of a distinguished religious lineage that, it was claimed, originated among the Idrissid royal family of Morocco. Although they had joined Abd al-Qadir's opposition to French rule, the Saïah subsequently adopted a successful new strategy of association with the French. The first member of the Saïah family to become a French-backed caïd, or rural governor, was Si Henni ben Essaïah, who was awarded the title of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor before his death in 1897. The Bouthiba, the other grand famille in Orléansville, had developed from a branch of the Saïah in Ténès but by 1954 was prominent in the Chélif Valley as well.

The Day of Solidarity raised 436 million francs (1.2 million US dollars), and by the end of September, departmental campaigns had already raised an additional 173,502,000 francs, including, in roughly equal measure, private donations (from individuals and organizations) and gifts from local governments (municipal and departmental).

Curie, “Operation Orléansville: Rapport,” 5. Hautberg noted that the shortage of tents was exacerbated by the fact that recipients sometimes left the Orléansville area altogether (e.g. for Algiers or for mainland France), without returning the tents. This, however, cannot account for more than a small fraction of the shortfall. Hautberg, Orléansville, 17.\n\n88.

Official estimates rose rapidly in October, as these documents show; among them, the latter “note” was an outlying estimate of the destruction from the two major tremors of September 9 and 16, claiming only twenty thousand gourbis had been destroyed, and five thousand houses—but this was still an order of magnitude greater than the number of tents supplied.\n\n90.

The metropolitan Service National de Protection Civile [SNPC] had originated in preparations for the Second World War. In 1938, a service of Défense Passive had been created within the defense ministry to prepare and organize local emergency and firefighting organizations, in order to prepare for the possibility of the aerial bombing of French cities. In 1948, the service was placed under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior. After the Korean War the service was reorganized as the SNPC, and given additional resources in order to prepare the French population for both wartime and peacetime calamities. Kessler, Une expérience, 1–4.

Some remained skeptical of such conclusions. A 1946 geographical study by a Prof. Corroy had declared that coal and gneiss of Reyran basin “present excellent geographical conditions from the point of view of being watertight [de son étanchéité]. In fact, the total impermeability of this reservoir is assured,”quoted in Valenti and Bertini, Barrage de Malpasset, 29. However, in 1972, Olivier Cousin argued that the site of the dam had been shifted 200 meters from the location originally proposed; more recently, Valenti's and Bertini's 2003 history of the dam suggests that insufficient attention was paid to a later report by Corroy urging further study of the site.

That the thirty-nine “North African” dead meant Algerian Muslims (a common usage at the time), not Moroccans or Tunisians, is also confirmed by the December 7 telegram, which counted fifty-eight “Algerians” (clearly Muslims, since Algerians were placed under the category of “foreigners”) of whom only eighteen had been identified at that point, and only one Moroccan. Ministère Intérieur Service National Protection Civile Inspection Générale to Tous Préfets (métropole Algérie), December 7, 1959, ANOM FM 1389, folder “Catastrophe de Fréjus.” The lists of the identified dead and reported missing published in a January 1960 official municipal bulletin (Archives Municipales de Fréjus) includes fifty-eight names that appear to be of Muslim North African origin as well as four apparently West African names.\n\n50.

December 1960–December 1961], ANFP F/2/4343, folder “Catastrophe de Fréjus.” Aid to non-North-Africans in this report totaled 88,190,431.96; this does not include other expenses such as transportation, expenses for aid workers, disposal of dead animals, public safety, or the donations for other disasters, for a total cost of over 172 million francs for the disaster response. The exact figure for North Africans is 360,212.12 francs. This figure for North Africans is identical in a different, draft version of this report, which includes a slightly different total of 90,932,660 francs for payments to the metropolitan French in Fréjus. Neither the figures published by the city government in the December 1960 anniversary brochure nor later reports by the Prefecture du Var issued in 1966 and 1968 distinguished aid payments by ethnic origin. It is not clear whether this accounting of donations received and aid distributed included the provision of housing by non-state actors such as the Protestant CIMADE (Comité Inter-Mouvements Auprès Des Évacués), which provided prefabricated short-term housing for Muslims, and by Sécours Catholique, which also provided some housing. According to the 1960 Mairie report, 4,611,320.76 francs was spent on housing, short and long term, for the general population (according to the 1968 report, this figure was 5,140,596.25 francs). Even if we were to assume that CIMADE's assistance meant that Algerian Muslims received a fair share of the investment in housing, this would mean that Muslims still received only 0.43 percent of the rest of the money used for survivors (360,212 francs spent on Muslims out of 83,049,836 in non-housing expenditures). On the role of CIMADE in Fréjus, see Ville de Fréjus, Malpasset un an après (Draguigan: Imprimerie Riccobono, December 1960), 6–9; for a broader context, see Darcie Fontaine, Decolonizing Christianity: Religion and the End of Empire in France and Algeria.

Cindy Ermus (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2018), 62–79. Erikson and Horowitz's approach to trauma reflects their awareness of the interconnections between memories of disasters and of the political and cultural milieu in which they occur—a major focus of the present volume. This approach diverges from definitions of trauma that emphasize the radical disconnect between the traumatic event and other life experiences and memories. However, as Paulina Grzeda warns, one should be hesitant to apply a diagnosis of trauma in a medical sense based on memoirs or literary texts that make use of “anti-narrative modes, such as self-reflexivity, disruption of linear chronology, fragmentation.” As Grzeda argues, it can be impossible to determine “whether such narrative patterns stem from the experience of trauma itself or whether they can be interpreted as the authors' deliberate choice to draw on well-established conventions by which trauma is recognized in literary representations.” Paulina Grzeda, “Trauma and Testimony: Autobiographical Writing in Post-Apartheid South Africa,” in Postcolonial Traumas: Memory, Narrative, Resistance, ed.

Gregory Mann has also described how the French residents of the town became accustomed to interacting with men from the colonies, and public funds were used to build a mosque for West African troops. In the interwar period, a few West African soldiers retired and remained in Fréjus, and the town became a destination for some West African civilians, including a few political activists. Funds for the mosque, according to Mann, came from both the city of Fréjus and the colonial government for French West Africa as well as from the Comité d'Assistance aux Troupes Noires. Political dissidents visiting Fréjus included, in 1926, Senegal's Lamine Senghor. Mann, “Locating Colonial Histories,” 427–428. See also Robion and Foucou, Fréjus Ve–XXe Siècle, 163–165.\n\n67.

It later emerged that there was also a gendered element to the distribution of suffering: women constituted 61.5 percent of the victims, and women tended to be afflicted more severely. Western medical observers offered several explanations for this disparity. One was that Moroccan women consumed more oil while cooking; another was that the disparity was due to women's subordinate status within the family, as men dined first, and women mopped up what was left with bread. A third explanation suggested that men often ate fewer meals at home. An exception to the general predominance of women was found in northern Morocco, where a large number of men lived away from their families and ate in canteens, where they had consumed the contaminated oil.

The article did not explicitly associate the Americans with “those who take advantage of the poverty of the masses and exploit economic crises,” and the fact that no Jews were affected was portrayed as evidence only of “the economic isolation in which Morocco's Jewish community lives” and of the way in which the poisoning was “engendering hatred and enmity between the communities living in Morocco.” Yost noted the less inflammatory content of the article itself but quoted only the headline of the Al Machahid (no. 34) article; the text is translated in David Nes to State, December 17, same folder.

The importance of Cold War concerns in stimulating American disaster relief in a slightly later period has been demonstrated by A. Cooper Drury, Richard Stuart Olson, and Douglas A.

Trade relations between Morocco and the United States would increase for the next decade, due in part to the development of the Moroccan phosphate industry, but would remain modest, amounting to only 7.5 percent of Moroccan imports and 4 percent of exports even in 1969.

In the Casablanca bidonville fire, Nouasser airmen joined firefighting efforts by the Moroccan army and the French Air Force. American relief efforts in the aftermath, which included the provision of food, tents, and the use of a generator, were accompanied by the work of the Moroccan Red Crescent, the Societé Musulman de Bienfaisance, the Casablanca municipal government, and the Ministries of Public Health and Public Works. In such a collective effort, it was no wonder that the United States was not singled out by the press. On January 15, 1960, American troops would again respond to another massive flood in the Gharb basin. To Navy Liaison Leon Borden Blair's consternation, the publicity after the 1960 flood also lacked a focus on American heroism, and Blair blamed United States Information Service (USIS) policy, which was “to avoid 'o"
