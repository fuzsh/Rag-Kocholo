        "text": "At the head of the Algerian government, President Bouteflika has replaced a secular and modernist Kabylian with an Islamo-conservative, loyal to the FLN [National Liberation Front]. With Abdelaziz Belkhadem, populism is becoming established at the head of power, a year away from the general election and at a time when the succession to the head of state is being planned. Formerly classed as a member of the 'eradicators' camp, Ahmed Ouyahia has been forced to step down, having supported Bouteflika's national reconciliation policy. His successor is among those who have always maintained the dialogue with the Islamists and who are labelled 'FLN veterans'. Foreign minister from August 2000 through May 2005, then the president's special representative, Abdelaziz Belkhadem is closely linked to the Franco-Algerian crisis over the friendship treaty, whose signing has been constantly postponed. His appointment is not a sign of detente in relations between Algiers and Paris. Hitherto a balance has been maintained within the government between the liberal and secular tendency of Ahmed Ouyahia's National Democratic Rally (RND), and the conservative and moderate Islamic tendency represented by the FLN and its Islamist allies of the Society and Peace Movement (MSP). It seems that Abdelaziz Belkhadem forced the head of state to choose. For some months, the secretary-general of the former single party had been in conflict with the outgoing prime minister and demanding his departure. The new prime minister intends to reform the constitution in order to strengthen the presidential system by authorizing a third term of office, increasing the term from five to seven years, and creating a post of vice president. On the economic plane, Abdelaziz Belkhadem, who has the support of the FLN apparatus and the trade unions, accuses the former prime minister of having refused to increase public sector salaries. Thanks to oil revenue boosted by the rise in crude prices, Algeria has adopted, under Ahmed Ouyahia's leadership, a programme of public finance reform and major investments, particularly in the housing field. With the approach of the May 2007 general election campaign, the former single party is adopting a populist stance and wants to assert itself on the social problems front in the struggle against unemployment and poverty. Having already strengthened the presidency by reducing the army's leeway, the head of state could this time displease the security services, with which Ahmed Ouyahia was reputed to maintain close ties. But, as in other Arab countries, Algeria's authoritarian regime has found a new means of bolstering its authority by reestablishing a political Islamism that it can control. There remains the uncertainly linked to President Bouteflika's illness, which now puts Abdelaziz Belkhadem in the position of fully designated successor."
