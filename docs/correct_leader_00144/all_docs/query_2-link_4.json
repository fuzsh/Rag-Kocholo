        "text": "HODEIDAH: Firefighting teams on Sunday were still battling a blaze at the Houthi-run port in Yemen’s Hodeidah, hours after an Israeli strike on the harbor triggered a massive fire and killed six people, according to the militia.\n\nSaturday’s strike on the vital port, a key entry point for fuel and humanitarian aid, is the first claimed by Israel in the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, about 2,000 kilometers (1,300 miles) away.\n\nIt killed six people and wounded 80, many of them with severe burns, the rebel-run health ministry said in a statement carried by Houthi media.\n\nOn Sunday, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the militia’s “response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge.”\n\nIsrael said it carried out the strike in response to a drone attack by the Houthis on Tel Aviv which killed one person on Friday.\n\nMore operations against the Houthis would follow “if they dare to attack us,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said.\n\nFollowing the strike, the Israeli military said Sunday it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen toward the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, noting that “the projectile did not cross into Israeli territory.”\n\nSaree, the Houthi spokesman, said the militia had fired ballistic missiles toward Eilat, the latest in a string of Houthi attempts to hit the port city.\n\nThe militia announcement came as firefighters struggled to contain the blaze at the Hodeidah port, with thick plumes of black smoke shrouding the sky above the city, said an AFP correspondent in the area.\n\nFuel storage tanks and a power plant at the port where still ablaze amid “slow” firefighting efforts, said a Hodeidah port employee.\n\nThe port employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security concerns, said it could take days to contain the fire, a view echoed by Yemen experts.\n\n“There is concern that the poorly equipped firefighters may not be able to contain the spreading fire, which could continue for days,” said Mohammed Albasha, senior Middle East analyst for the US-based Navanti Group, warning that it could reach food storage facilities at the harbor.\n\nHodeidah port, a vital entry point for fuel imports and international aid for militia-held areas of Yemen, had remained largely untouched through the decade-long war between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government propped up by neighboring Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Houthis control swathes of Yemen, including much of its Red Sea coast, and the war has left millions of Yemenis dependent on aid supplied through the port.\n\nDespite Houthi assurances of sufficient fuel stocks, Saturday’s strike triggered fears of worsening shortages, which war-weary Yemenis are ill-equiped to handle.\n\nThe attack is “going to have dire humanitarian effects on the millions of ordinary Yemenis living in Houthi-held Yemen,” Nicholas Brumfield, a Yemen expert, said on social media platform X.\n\nIt will drive up prices of fuel but also any goods carried by truck, the analyst said.\n\nYemen’s internationally-recognized government, which has been battling the Houthis for nearly a decade, condemned the strike, and held Israel responsible for a worsening humanitarian crisis.\n\nA statement carried by the official Saba news agency said the Yemeni government holds “the Zionist entity fully responsible for any repercussions resulting from its air strikes, including the deepening of a humanitarian crises.”\n\nIt also warned the huthi militia against dragging the country into “senseless battles that serve the interests of the Iranian regime and its expansionist project in the region.”\n\nLONDON: Israel’s education minister and national student union have endorsed a law to curb academic speech in the country, The Guardian reported on Sunday.\n\nLeading universities have attacked the bill as “McCarthyite” and fundamentally undemocratic.\n\nThe legislation, currently being debated in the Knesset, would give a government-appointed committee the power to order the firing of academic staff that it decides have expressed “support for terror.” If the universities refused, their funding would be cut.\n\nCritics argue that the legislation undermines Israeli academia by restricting free speech and allowing politicians to weaponize accusations that should be handled by the legal system.\n\nUri Sivan, president of the esteemed Technion — Israel Institute of Technology, condemned the law as “a very violent form of McCarthyism,” intended to stifle free expression. Despite these concerns, two-thirds of the student union’s university chapters supported the campaign.\n\nThe student union invested over $136,000 in a nationwide billboard campaign promoting the law. This prompted Haaretz newspaper to warn in an editorial that the country’s “illiberal students need a lesson in democracy.”\n\nIn Israel, criticism of the Gaza war is already heavily restricted, even for Jewish citizens.\n\nA teacher charged with treason and held in solitary confinement for four days after voicing concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza described the current atmosphere as “a time of witch-hunts.”\n\nIsrael’s Education Minister Yoav Kisch said he backed the law, although it is not a government initiative.\n\n“It is important that academic institutions have great independence, but there are places that cross a line that must not be crossed,” his office said in a statement.\n\nOfir Katz, a member of the governing Likud party and chair of the ruling coalition, presented the draft as a private bill, with other backers including a legislator from the party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rival, Benny Gantz. It has now passed the first of four Knesset votes.\n\nSivan expressed concerns about the law’s broad restrictions, noting that existing laws against incitement to terror already apply to all residents. “Why is academia singled out (with this law)?” he asked, suggesting the move aims to intimidate independent thinkers. He warned of a severe violation of democratic principles, asserting, “In a democratic country, everyone is equal before the law.”\n\nThe Association of University Heads, Israel, known as Vera, in a public letter criticized the student union billboards as a divisive “campaign of persecution and incitement” that could lead to violence. Vera cautioned that the draft law could provoke international sanctions against Israeli universities by undermining their academic independence.\n\nThere has already been outrage following the use of anti-terrorism laws to detain Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a prominent legal scholar, over her criticism of the Gaza war.\n\nAnat Matar from Tel Aviv University’s philosophy department expressed alarm over student involvement in promoting the law, describing it as particularly disturbing.\n\n“Whether or not it passes, significant damage has already been done,” she told The Guardian. “The mere fact that it is supported by the national student union and by many local student unions, and that there is hardly any protest among students against, it manifests another step down the ladder towards full-blown fascism.”\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid warned that the law would erode democracy, arguing that it allows politicians, rather than legal authorities, to determine what constitutes speaking against the state of Israel.\n\n“You’re allowing governing politicians to decide what is in favor of Israel and what is against it, what is permissible to say and what is forbidden,” Lapid told the Knesset.\n\nAMMAN: A Jordanian trade delegation on Sunday concluded a trip to Tunisia aimed at strengthening economic relations, Jordan News Agency reported.\n\nThe visit was organized by the Amman Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with the Tunisian Embassy in Amman. It included a series of meetings with companies, visits to several factories, and discussions with various professional unions, associations and commercial and industrial sectors in Tunis, Sousse and Sfax.\n\nDuring the multiday visit, the delegation identified promising investment opportunities across diverse sectors, including textiles, automotive parts manufacturing, food industries, tourism, logistics, and medical supplies.\n\nKey discussions highlighted the potential to enhance tourism cooperation, promoting each country as a destination through reciprocal initiatives.\n\nThe delegation emphasized the importance of regular exchanges and exhibitions to deepen business ties between Jordan and Tunisia, supported by an updated joint database on economic and investment opportunities.\n\nTalks resulted in a series of understandings and the renewal of agreements, paving the way for broader economic engagement aligned with the mutual interests of both countries.\n\nImmediate plans include organizing sector-specific visits for business owners from both countries, with the first delegation focused on the clothing and footwear sector scheduled to visit Tunisia within the next two months, Petra reported.\n\nThe ACC highlighted the economic agreements linking Jordan and Tunisia with various global economic blocs, facilitating their presence in regional markets such as Europe and Africa.\n\nIn 2023, bilateral trade between Jordan and Tunisia reached $35 million. Jordan’s exports were primarily in chemicals, plastics, textiles, metals, food products and agricultural goods.\n\nIn meetings with Tunisian Minister of Trade and Export Development Kalthoum Ben Rejeb, ACC Chairman Khalil Haj Tawfiq called for strengthened cooperation between businesses in the two countries.\n\nHe proposed addressing impediments to trade flow in the legislative, logistical and administrative domains, while suggesting the establishment of a joint higher committee to facilitate joint exhibitions and networking events.\n\nBen Rejeb emphasised the importance of such meetings in enhancing economic ties and identifying new avenues for trade, particularly in strategic sectors such as pharmaceuticals, automotive components, electrical goods and food industries.\n\nShe underscored Tunisia’s role as a gateway to Africa and Jordan’s strategic positioning for Gulf markets, highlighting the potential for enhanced economic integration.\n\nJERUSALEM/CAIRO: Israel said it shot down a missile launched from Yemen on Sunday and the Yemeni Houthi movement said it had fired several missiles at the Israeli city of Eilat after Israel’s first public strike against the Iran-aligned group a day earlier.\n\nThe Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel and disrupted global trade through the Red Sea in response to Israel’s assault on Gaza, further destabilising the Middle East as war in the Palestinian enclave rages on after nine months.\n\nIsrael says the Houthis have launched 200 attacks against it since the Gaza war began, many of them intercepted and most of them not deadly.\n\nBut a rare Houthi drone strike on Friday hit Tel Aviv and killed one person, prompting Israel to announce its first strikes against the group on Saturday. The strikes by warplanes hit near the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and killed six people, local medics said.\n\nThe Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, said on Sunday it would continue to attack Israel in response.\n\nHouthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam told Qatar’s Al Jazeera TV there would be “no red lines ... all sensitive institutions ... will be a target for us.”\n\nThe Israeli military said its Arrow 3 missile defense system had shot down a surface-to-surface missile projectile launched from Yemen on Sunday before it crossed into Israeli territory.\n\nBefore the interception, air raid sirens sounded in the Red Sea port city of Eilat, sending residents running for shelter.\n\nSunday’s attack prolonged an escalation of violence between Israel and the Houthis that began with the Houthi drone strike that hit the center of Tel Aviv on Friday. One man was killed and four other people were wounded, officials said.\n\nThe Israeli warplanes’ air raid on Hodeidah on Saturday killed six people and wounded more than 80, medical sources in Yemen told Reuters, describing all as civilians.\n\nImages from the scene showed a fiery blaze and dense smoke rising from the site of the strike. A Houthi-run TV channel said the strikes had hit an oil facility and power station.\n\nIsraeli officials say Hodeidah port has been used by the Houthis to receive weapons shipments from Iran.\n\nPROXY BATTLE\n\nThe exchanges are part of a spillover from the Gaza war that has drawn in regional and world powers.\n\nIran-aligned groups including the Houthis have fired rockets and missiles at Israel saying they are doing so in support of Palestinians and the Islamist militant group Hamas that governs Gaza. The United States and its allies back Israel and provide weapons to it.\n\nThe war began on Oct. 7 after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and over 250 taken hostage back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIsrael has since bombed and invaded Gaza as part of what it says is a campaign to eliminate Hamas, killing nearly 39,000 people, according to health officials in the enclave.\n\nThe Houthis, who control much of the north of Yemen and other large population centers, have previously claimed targeting Eilat and other attacks directed at Israel, saying they are acting in retaliation for Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nThe group has also attacked Red Sea shipping routes for months.\n\nHamas’ allies include Iran-backed groups such as the Houthis, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraqi paramilitaries.\n\nThe Houthi movement consists primarily of members a minority Shiite Muslim group in Yemen and has controlled the country’s capital, Sanaa, for years."
