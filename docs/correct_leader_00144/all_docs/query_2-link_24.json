        "text": "Former Algerian prime minister and head of the country’s coalition RND party, Ahmed Ouyahia, has encouraged Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to resign, according to a party statement.\n\nOuyahia’s message was the latest blow to Bouteflika’s withering leadership after Algeria’s army chief withdrew support for the embattled president on Tuesday.\n\nHe dropped plans to run for a fifth presidential term in the face of widespread protests.\n\nBut he remained in office and demonstrations have resumed.\n\nGaid Salah, speaking on Tuesday, praised the maturity of Algerians and their peaceful protests.\n\n“In order to protect our country from any hazardous situation, everybody needs to show selflessness and to take into consideration the higher interests of our home country in order to find an immediate solution to this crisis,” he said.\n\n“A solution in accordance to the constitution that is the only guarantee of a stable situation.\n\n“In this regard, we urge and have to adopt a solution that guarantees a crisis exit and responds to the legitimate demands of the Algerian people.\n\n“This solution ensures the respect of the constitution and the rule of law. It will also guarantee consensus among all parties. Such a solution is stipulated by article 102 of the constitution.”"
