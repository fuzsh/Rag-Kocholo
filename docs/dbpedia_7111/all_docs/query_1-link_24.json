It is using the cash for M&A and share buybacks.\n\n\"Exor becomes a long-term investor in Clarivate, endorsing the strategic direction set out by the company's management and board,\" the companies said.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Exor COO Suzanne Heywood would be a candidate for a seat on Clarivate's board at the company's shareholders meeting in May, they added.\n\nFinancial details were not disclosed, but UK-based Clarivate -- a global provider of data, analytics, technology and expert services to several sectors including healthcare -- has a market capitalisation of around $4.8 billions.\n\nExor, which already held a stake in Clarivate of just above 1%, has now become its second largest investor. Should it increase its shareholding to 17.5%, Exor would match the company's current top shareholder, private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners.\n\nExor's investments cover a broad range of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, media, fashion, sport and technology. Last year the Netherlands-based company spent 2.6 billion euros to buy a 15% stake in Philips's and become its single largest investor.\n\n(Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari; editing by Gavin Jones and Jonathan Oatis)"
