        "text": "On 29 July 2022, Exor announced that its Board of Directors approved the transfer of the listing of the company’s ordinary shares to Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nUpon admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam, which is expected on 12 August 2022, Exor will request the delisting of its ordinary shares from Euronext Milan which will become effective not earlier than 45 calendar days thereafter (in accordance with Borsa Italiana rules).\n\nPlease note that before listing on Euronext Amsterdam, Exor was already a Dutch company, so the tax treatment of the dividends received by its shareholders will not change as a result of the transfer of listing.\n\nFor information on your personal tax implications for holding Exor ordinary shares you must consult your tax advisor.\n\nThe principal settlement systems to be used for the trading and settlement of Exor’s ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam are the book-entry systems operated by Euronext Securities Milan (formerly Monte Titoli S.p.A.), Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., and the Netherlands Central Institute for Giro Securities Transactions (Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer B.V.) trading as Euroclear Nederland.\n\nThese systems have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial links among themselves, and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow ordinary shares to be issued, held and transferred among the settlement systems without the physical transfer of ordinary shares.\n\nDuring the delisting process, which will last not less than 45 calendar days after the filing of the request of delisting with Euronext Milan, Exor’s ordinary shares will continue to trade both on Euronext Milan and Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nOn the date of admission to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam, Exor’s ordinary shares will continue to be deposited in your securities account held with your bank or broker.\n\nConsidering the links among the book-entry systems operated by Euronext Securities Milan (formerly Monte Titoli S.p.A.), Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., and the Netherlands Central Institute for Giro Securities Transactions (Euroclear Nederland), and others, no particular implications are envisaged for shareholders. However, you should consult your bank or broker to verify if there are any arrangements that need to be made before trading of your ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nAs settlement of trades on Euronext Amsterdam through Euroclear Bank or Euroclear Nederland is possible only if you or your bank or broker maintains a securities account with an institution which has been admitted by Euroclear Bank or Euroclear Nederland, respectively, you should consult your bank or broker to determine whether deposit arrangements are necessary to trade your ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nYour ordinary shares will continue to be managed by your bank or broker.\n\nConsidering the links among the book-entry systems operated by Euronext Securities Milan (formerly Monte Titoli S.p.A.), Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., and the Netherlands Central Institute for Giro Securities Transactions (Euroclear Nederland), and others, no particular implications are envisaged for shareholders. However, you should consult your bank or broker if there are any arrangements that need to be made before trading of the ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nThe main indices on Euronext Amsterdam (AEX, AMX and AScX) are reviewed on a quarterly basis. During each review period, all listed companies are reviewed for index inclusion in accordance with the eligibility criteria defined in the AEX Index Family Rulebook. The earliest time in which Exor will be considered for inclusion in one of these indices is during the quarterly review in December 2022. Euronext Amsterdam, as Administrator of the AEX, AMX and AScX indices, will announce any changes made to the indices in its periodical reviews."
