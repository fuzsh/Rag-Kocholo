        "text": "Repeat tech founders secures £12m ($15m) Series A funding round, led by Exor Ventures with angels from KKR, Morgan Stanley and Linklaters.\n\nJigsaw leverages data and AI to transform how businesses visualise, design, and manage corporate structures. It facilitates the creation of diagrams at 40x the speed of legacy tools such as PowerPoint and enables its users to build a visual-first system of record.\n\nFounded by Stephen Scanlan and Travis Leon, Jigsaw is the pair’s second successful venture together. They previously co-founded, scaled and sold XRef, a proofreading software company, in 2016 (now Litera, a $1bn+ company). As former city professionals with over two decades of combined experience in the legal and financial services industries, Jigsaw’s co-founders are on a mission to empower white-collar professionals to do business visually on a shared platform.\n\nJigsaw was released just 3 years ago and is already becoming the standard corporate structure visualisation platform across major financial institutions, accountancy practices (including the Big Four), and global law firms (including Ashurst, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Goodwin Procter).\n\nStephen Scanlan, co-founder at Jigsaw, said,\n\n“We’ve dedicated ourselves to building products that white-collar professionals deeply value for corporate structuring. Up next, we’re going to double down on generative AI and collaboration features. We also plan to expand our multi-product line focused on visualising complex transactions into an end-to-end platform to manage corporate structures and governance.”\n\nIn addition to investing in its platform, Jigsaw will continue to grow its global footprint. It already has offices in London, Miami, California, Chicago and Barcelona, and will launch in Singapore in 2024.\n\nNoam Ohana and Michael Lavner, from Exor Ventures commented,\n\n“We are thrilled to partner with Stephen and Travis, having experienced first-hand the need for the Jigsaw platform. The solution represents a paradigm shift in how knowledge workers manage structured information. Customer feedback has been phenomenal, and this round is a great step towards building the category leading AI-powered platform for corporate structuring.”"
