        "text": "The task of the stock exchange is to provide an infrastructure for the trading of financial instruments. The level of prices is decided solely by the investors with their buy and sell orders. The following information does not constitute an investment advice or an invitation to purchase or trade securities. The fact that a company can be traded on the stock exchange does not guarantee the success of the investment. As an investor, you have to inform yourself and weigh up the chances of value increases and risks, up to total loss. Ask for advice, if necessary. Particularly younger and smaller enterprises can experience higher price fluctuations and often have less information available.\n\nThe following securities are listed on a market in which the EU regulations and the issuer obligations under stock exchange law for regulated markets, in particular with regard to information obligations, do not apply in full. However, most of the provisions of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) apply, in any case the prohibition of insider trading and market manipulation. If the issuer (the traded company) approves or requests admission of the financial instrument to trading, insider information and managers' transactions must be published and insider lists maintained.\n\nFinancial instruments of foreign companies may differ from those of domestic companies. For example, with regard to the rights and obligations associated with the security, such as participation rights, dividend or tax treatment or delivery and custody of the securities, as well as the amount of information available to investors."
