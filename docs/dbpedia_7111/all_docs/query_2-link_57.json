        "text": "Amsterdam, 11 April 2024\n\nEXOR DELIVERS 33% GROWTH IN NAV PER SHARE IN 2023\n\nNAV reached €35.5 billion at 31 December 2023 with NAV per share increasing by 32.7%, outperforming the MSCI World Index by 15.1 p.p. This increase was mainly driven by the share price performance of Ferrari and Stellantis.\n\nPortfolio diversification increased after the PartnerRe sale, with €5.4 billion cash deployed in 2023 into Companies, Investments and share buybacks, while maintaining a strong balance sheet with an LTV ratio of 10% at year-end.\n\nExor has determined that it is an Investment Entity under IFRS 10 as of 1 January 2024, driven by its evolution as a company. From this date, it will change its reporting accordingly by deconsolidating portfolio companies and accounting for them at fair value.\n\nOrdinary dividend to be distributed of approximately €100 million, corresponding to €0.46 per share, subject to AGM approval.

The total amount invested was €2,771 million.\n\nOn 20 February 2024, Philips announced that Benoît Ribadeau-Dumas will be nominated for election to the Philips Supervisory Board at the company's next annual general meeting of shareholders on 7 May 2024.\n\nIncrease in investment in Lingotto funds\n\nDuring 2023, Exor invested a total amount of €563 million of which €400 million in funds managed by Lingotto, the independent alternative investment manager wholly owned by Exor.\n\nCompletion of €500 million share buyback program and new program of €1 billion\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, Exor purchased ordinary shares for a total invested amount of €246 million, completing the €500 million share buyback program announced in March 2022.\n\nOn 13 September 2023, Exor's Board approved a new share buyback program up to €1 billion to be completed in the following 12 months. Exor considers buybacks an attractive opportunity to invest in its own Companies when terms are attractive.\n\nAs part of this transaction, on 14 September 2023, Exor launched a reverse Dutch auction tender offer for an aggregate consideration up to €750 million to qualifying shareholders.\n\nOn 13 October 2023, Exor announced that the tender offer was oversubscribed and priced at zero premium to reference price. In accordance with its irrevocable undertaking, shares were purchased from Giovanni Agnelli B.V. for a total consideration of €202 million.\n\nThe tender offer allowed Exor to acquire 3.8% of the issued ordinary shares efficiently and at an attractive discount.\n\nIn 2024, Exor expects to buy back shares for the remaining €250 million through on-market purchases of ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nSupport to Juventus' capital increase\n\nOn 6 October 2023, Juventus communicated Exor’s support to the company's capital increase by undertaking to subscribe a portion equivalent to its 63.8% stake and Exor’s commitment to execute a contribution for future capital increases for a maximum of €127 million. On 21 December 2023, Juventus communicated that Exor had committed to subscribe for any newly issued shares that may remain unsubscribed at the end of the offering period, up to an aggregate amount equal to approximately €72 million, and that Exor had paid in full its contribution to capital increase.\n\nOn 4 April 2024, Juventus announced that following the auction of the pre-emptive rights not exercised during the offer period, its capital increase has been fully subscribed. Therefore, funding of the approximately €72 million that Exor had underwritten is not required.\n\nCredit rating upgrade by Standard and Poor's\n\nOn 9 November 2023, Standard & Poor’s communicated that it had upgraded Exor’s long-term corporate credit rating to A- from BBB+, maintaining a “stable” outlook. The short-term rating of Exor is A-2.\n\nNew bond issue\n\nOn 14 February 2024, Exor issued bonds for a nominal amount of €650 million, maturing on 14 February 2033 with an issue price of 99.371% and a fixed annual coupon of 3.75%. The purpose of the issue was to raise new funds for Exor's general corporate purposes and refinance debt maturing in 2024. The notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market, with an A- credit rating assigned by Standard & Poor’s.\n\nInvestment in Clarivate\n\nOn 4 March, 2024 Exor announced that it had become a long-term investor in Clarivate, endorsing the strategic direction set out by the company's management and board, with a 10.1% shareholding in the company.\n\nOn the same date, Clarivate and Exor announced that Suzanne Heywood, Exor's COO, will be nominated for election to the Clarivate Board of Directors at the company's next annual general meeting of shareholders on 7 May 2024.\n\nThe total amount invested in Clarivate since 2022 is $596 million.\n\nDividend and distribution of reserves expected to be received in 2024\n\nThe dividends and distributions of reserves already received or proposed by the Board of Directors of some investee companies are as follows:\n\nNumber of shares\n\nDividendsInvestee companyPer share (€)Total (€ million)Stellantis N.V. 449,410,092 1.55 697CNH Industrial N.V.

The one-off positive impact on the income statement is expected to be approximately €12 billion, resulting from the difference between the net carrying amount of investments previously consolidated or accounted for using the equity method and their fair value at the date of the change. The definitive impact will be disclosed in the Half-Year 2024 results.\n\nExor believes that this change will better align Exor’s reporting and financial disclosures to its business and activities, with NAV and other key metrics audited.\n\nNET ASSET VALUE (NAV)\n\n€ millionAsset Type31/12/202331/12/2022Change vs.\n\n31 December 2022Amount%Companies 34,233 24,278 9,955 41.0%FerrariL 13,562 8,896 4,666 52.5%StellantisL 9,505 5,961 3,544 59.5%CNH IndustrialL 4,066 5,491 (1,425) (26.0%)PhilipsL 2,937 — 2,937n.a.IvecoL 598 408 190 46.6%JuventusL 542 510 32 6.3 %Other companies(a)P 3,023 3,012 11 0.4%Investments 2,836 1,766 1,070 60.6%Lingotto(b)L/P 2,099 1,185 914 77.1%Ventures(c)P 737 581 156 26.9%Others 2,750 6,443 (3,693) (57.3%)Reinsurance vehiclesP 802 622 180 28.9%Other assets(d)P 463 378 85 22.5%Liquidity(e) 1,395 5,349 (3,954) (73.9%)Treasury stock(f) 90 94 (4) (4.3)%Gross Asset Value 39,819 32,487 7,332 22.6%Gross Debt(4,286) (4,234) (52) 1.2%Bonds and bank debt (3,682) (3,625) (57) 1.6%Financial liabilities(g) (604) (609) 5 (0.8%)Other liabilities (20) (20) — —%Net Asset Value (NAV) 35,513 28,233 7,280 25.8%NAV per Share in Euro(h) 162.36 122.34 40.02 32.7%\n\nL= Listed Company; P= Private Company.\n\n(a) Other companies at 31 December 2023 include Institut Mérieux (€844 million), Christian Louboutin (€700 million), Via Transportation (€514 million), The Economist (€384 million), Welltec (€280 million), TagEnergy (€100 million), Lifenet (€71 million), GEDI (€68 million), NUO (€42 million), Casavo (€20 million) and Shang Xia (€0 million).
