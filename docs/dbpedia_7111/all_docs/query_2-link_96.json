        "text": "Ferrari N.V. (RACE) is a Dutch holding company that owns Ferrari S.p.A, an iconic company that makes money predominantly from manufacturing and selling its luxury cars. Let‚Äôs look at who owns Ferrari and controls it.\n\nFerrari‚Äôs largest shareholders are Exor, controlled by the Agnelli family, which owns a 24.4% share, followed by Piero Ferrari, who owns a 10.4% share. Thanks to special ‚Äúvoting shares,‚Äù Exor and Piero Ferrari together hold 51.6% of voting power and control Ferrari.\n\nFerrari's Largest Shareholders (Dec 2022)ShareholderOwnershipVoting PowerExor24.4%36.2%Piero Ferrari10.4%15.4%BlackRock5.7%4.2%Other59.5%44.1%\n\nListed are shareholders holding >5% of any share class or notable in other ways Source: Multiple SEC filings\n\nIn this article, I will dive more into who owns Ferrari and who controls it. I will show you who Ferrari‚Äôs largest shareholders are, how many shares and votes they have, and how much their stake is worth.\n\nIf you are interested, you can also explore who owns other companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, Alphabet(Google), L‚ÄôOr√©al, or Xiaomi.\n\nüìÉ Who Owns Ferrari?\n\nFerrari is owned by its shareholders. The largest ones are Exor, controlled by the Agnelli family, which owns 24.4% of the company, followed by Piero Ferrari, with a 10.4% ownership share, and BlackRock (5.7%). Thanks to ‚Äúspecial voting‚Äù shares, Exor and Piero Ferrari control Ferrari.\n\nThe largest owner of Ferrari is the holding company Exor, which owns 24.4% of Ferrari. Exor N.V. is controlled by the Agnelli family, descendants of Giovanni Agnelli, founder of Fiat.\n\nThey control Exor N.V. through Giovanni Angelli B.V., which owns 52% of Exor and holds 85% of its voting rights.\n\nThe second largest Ferrari owner is the son of Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari, Piero Ferrari, who owns a 10.4% ownership stake.\n\nA sizable owner is also asset manager BlackRock, which owns 5.7% of the company.\n\nExor N.V. (controlled by the Agnelli family) and Piero Ferrari are not just independent shareholders minding their own business. They signed a shareholder agreement and are coordinating their positions before the shareholder meetings.\n\nExor N.V. and Piero Ferrari also agreed that if any of them wants to sell their stake in the future, Exor will have the right to buy it if they match the third-party offer, and Piero Ferrari has the right to the first offer.\n\nNext to holding regular common shares of Ferrari, Exor and Piero Ferrari also hold special voting shares that give them control over Ferrari.\n\nFerrari N.V. is a Dutch registered holding company that is traded in New York (ticker: RACE) and Milan and owns 100% of Ferrari S.p.A., which makes and sells famous Ferrari cars and holds stakes in other subsidiaries. Ferrari S.p.A has headquarters in Maranello, Italy.\n\nFerrari was previously owned by Fiat but was spun off from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2015.\n\nFerrari was founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari and has been a publicly listed company since it was listed on NYSE in 2015 (Ticker: RACE).\n\nFerrari N.V. is registered in the Netherlands, but its headquarters are in Maranello, Italy.\n\nüéÆ Who Controls Ferrari (RACE)?\n\nFerrari‚Äôs shareholders with the largest voting power are Exor, which holds 36.2% of all votes, followed by Piero Ferrari, with 15.4% voting power, and BlackRock (4.2%).\n\nAs you can see, the size of voting power is not equal to ownership. The reason why certain shareholders have outsized voting power compared to their ownership stake is that Ferrari N.V. has two types of outstanding shares.\n\nCommon Shares: These are regular shares traded in New York and Milan and have one vote per share.\n\nSpecial Voting Shares: These shares can be held only by the shareholders that held Ferrari N.V. common shares for at least three years. They have negligible economic rights but give their holder an extra vote per share.\n\nFerrari‚Äôs shareholder with the largest voting power is holding company Exor, which holds 36.2% of all votes. Exor owns 24.4% of Ferrari, but its voting power is boosted by special voting shares they own.\n\nExor is controlled by the Agnelli family. The head of the family seems to be John Elkann, the heir of Giovanni Agnelli, his grandfather.\n\nJohn Elkann is CEO and chairman of Exor N.V. and represents the interests of Exor on Ferrari‚Äôs board of directors as chairman.\n\nFerrari‚Äôs shareholder with the second-largest voting power is Piero Ferrari, who holds 15.4% of all votes. Piero Ferrari owns just 10.4% of the Ferrari, but its voting power is the result of special voting shares.\n\nPiero Ferrari is also a member of Ferrari‚Äôs board.\n\nTogether, Exor N.V., and Piero Ferrari, own 35% of Ferrari. And because both Piero and Exor own special voting shares, they together control Ferrari with 52% voting power.\n\nCurrently, special voting shares are held only by Exor N.V. and Piero Ferrari, giving them double the votes they would otherwise have. Therefore they together control the company.\n\nAlso, Piero Ferrari and Exor N.V. has signed a shareholder agreement and are consulting their positions before shareholder meetings. They also have agreements that if Piero decides to sell, Exor N.V. has the right to match the offer, and if Exor decides to sell its stake, Piero Ferrari has the right to make the first offer.\n\nTo sum up, Exor and Piero Ferrari, when acting together, are in charge, except on matters where two-thirds of shareholder votes are needed.\n\nWhat could shake up their tight control of Ferrari is if another shareholder, for example, BlackRock, holds its shares for more than three years and asks the company to assign them special voting shares too. If that happens, Exor and Piero Ferrari will have less than 50% of the votes, which would probably force them to buy more shares on the market to get the company back under their control.\n\nFerrari ‚Äòs important insiders are mainly CEO Benedetto Vitna, chairman of the board John Elkann (who represents the Agnelli family), and other board members and executives.\n\nFerrari‚Äôs board has ten (10) members.\n\nNobody from the board of directors or executive officers, except Piero Ferrari, holds more than 0.05% of Ferrari‚Äôs shares.\n\nüó≥Ô∏è Breakdown of Ferrari‚Äôs Outstanding Shares and Votes by Top Shareholders\n\nFerrari N.V. had a total of 182 million outstanding shares as of December 2022.

However, Exor controls 36.2% of all votes thanks to owning special voting shares. As of December 2022, the market value of Exor‚Äôs stake in Ferrari was $9.5 billion.\n\nExor owned 44 million shares in Ferrari and controlled 89 million shareholder votes as of December 2022.\n\nExor N.V is a publicly traded holding company that owns significant stakes in companies like Ferrari, PartnerRE, Stellantis, CNH Industrial, Juventus, Iveco Group, and also The Economist Group. Exor also invested in several smaller startups.\n\nExor N.V. is controlled by the Agnelli family, who are descendants of Giovanni Agnelli, founder of Fiat. Thir control it through another dutch company Giovanni Agnelli B.V.\n\nThis control is evident from the company‚Äôs list of directors. Jonh Ellkan, chairman and CEO, is the grandson of Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli and is his chosen heir. Board of Exor also includes his sister Ginevra Elkann and relatives Andrea Agnelli and Alessandro Nasi.\n\nExor is controlled by the family through company Giovanni Agnelli B.V. which owns 52% of the company and holds 85% of outstanding voting thanks to special voting shares.\n\n#2 Piero Ferrari (10.4%)\n\nPiero Ferrari is the second-largest shareholder of Ferrari, owning 10.4% of its shares. However, Piero Ferrari controls 15.4% of all votes thanks to owning special voting shares. As of December 2022, the market value of Piero Ferrari‚Äôs stake in Ferrari was $4.0 billion.\n\nPiero Ferrari owned 19 million shares in Ferrari and controlled 38 million shareholder votes as of December 2022.\n\nPiero Lardi Ferrari is the son of Enzo Ferrari, Ferrari‚Äôs founder. After Enzo‚Äôs death, Piero became a sole heir of a 10% stake in the Ferrari company.\n\n#3 BlackRock (5.7%)\n\nBlackRock is the third-largest shareholder of Ferrari, owning 5.7% of its shares. However, because other shareholders hold super-voting shares, BlackRock‚Äôs voting power is only 4.2%. As of December 2022, the market value of BlackRock‚Äôs stake in Ferrari was $2.2 billion.\n\nBlackRock owned 10 million shares in Ferrari and controlled 10 million shareholder votes as of December 2022.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. is the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, with assets under management of $10 trillion. BlackRock is not only an asset manager, but it also provides other asset managers and corporations with its Aladdin portfolio management software.\n\nBlackRock is a publicly traded company, and its largest shareholders are its competitors, including BlackRock itself. Not directly but through their passive and active funds. The largest shareholder is Vanguard.\n\nA similar situation is also true in the opposite direction because BlackRock is a significant shareholder in many of its publicly traded competitors and other large institutions, making the whole thing even more eyebrow-raising.\n\nThis circular ownership between Vanguard, BlackRock, and other large asset managers, amplifies the issue often raised about the power of these large asset managers over public companies since they usually belong to the most significant shareholders with large voting power.\n\nIn the case of Blackrock, this influence is personified in the form of its CEO Larry Fink, who is a powerful figure with close ties to the FED and US government.\n\nAdding to these concerns is evidence that BlackRock and other asset managers usually vote in favor of management proposals.\n\n‚ùî Does Fiat Still Owns Ferrari?\n\nFiat acquired 90% of Ferrari in the 1960s, and Ferrari has been part of Fiat since that. However, soon after Fiat merged with Chrysler to form Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), they spun Ferrari into a separate public company in 2016. Ferrari is an independent company now.\n\nEven though Ferrari is a public company, the Agnelli family, descendants of Fiat‚Äôs founding father Giovanni Agnelli, still own a significant stake in Ferrari through a company Exor, which they control.\n\nTogether Piere Ferrari, son of Ferrari‚Äôs founder, the Agnelli family, is controlling the majority of voting power in Ferrari through special voting shares they held, even though Piero Ferrari and Exor own ‚Äúonly‚Äù 35% of Ferrari‚Äôs capital.\n\nüß± Who and When Founded Ferrari?\n\nFerrari, a luxury sports car manufacturer, was founded in 1939 in Italy by Enzo Ferrari, father of the current second-largest shareholder, Piero Ferrari.\n\nThe first car was produced in 1940, but the first Ferrari-branded car was not produced until 1947.\n\nüìÖ Ferrari‚Äôs History Timeline\n\nThese are selected events from Ferrari‚Äôs history:\n\n1939: Ferrari was founded by Enzo Ferrari\n\n1940: The first car produced (Tipo 815)\n\n1947: The first Ferrari car produced (125 S)\n\n1956: Enzo Ferrari‚Äôs firstborn son Alfredo died\n\n1963: Ferrari withdrew from negotiations with Ford to sell his company\n\n1965: Fiat acquired a small stake in Ferrari as it offered more flexibility\n\n1969: Fiat acquired a 50% stake in Ferrari, which brought more money for investments into new models.\n\n1988: Fiat increased its ownership to 90% of Ferrari, and Enzo retained a 10% stake.\n\n1988: Enzo Ferrari passed away at the age of 90\n\n2014: Fiat and Chrysler merged into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA)\n\n2015: FCA sold 10% of Ferrari through a direct listing on the New York stock exchange, reducing its stake to 80%; Piero Ferrari owned 10%.\n\n2016: Ferrari is spun off from FCA and becomes a separate company.
