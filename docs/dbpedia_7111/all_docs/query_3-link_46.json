        "text": "Exor international, an italian company operating globally, has been designing, developing and manufacturing solutions in hmi, control and industrial iot for nearly half a century. exor provides customers with easy-to-use tools which express a highly advanced technology fully responsive to the concepts of industry 4.0. founded in verona in 1971, today it has 150 employees across italy, germany, usa and india. these exor branches are staffed with local experts so as to better understand the needs of those markets and provide the most responsive solutions. in addition there are over 40 distributors worldwide that are added to the exor network. the design and production of our products remain focused in the italian office. as an indication of our confidence in our product we are the only one in the world to offer a five-year standard hardware warranty. over 80% of our turnover is realised in non-italian markets. a precise business philosophy is followed which influences all the choices that are made: everything in the company is the result of the collaboration of experience and talent, shared with new ideas and given space for our young engineers to express themselves. in an ever-changing economic environment rather than employing our resources on what might change, we prefer to focus on what will not change 1) the need of our customers for our technology that reliably improves performance and security 2) the awareness that when entrepreneurs make a choice for their automation processes, they know they are committed for ten years. we are aware that the entrepreneur who signs a contract takes on major risks. in this risk taking we have to be a guarantee with our products and our support. we constantly question whether what we do helps our customer to get the most out of what is available on the market and the ability to work together to solve the problems."
