        "text": "How to become a successful entrepreneur? The answer is complex but involves creating things, making mistakes, improving, and most importantly, listening to the advice and experiences of those who have already made their mark. That's why, a few weeks before Investor Day, we give to our founders the opportunity to be part of a special fireside chat at Talent Garden featuring two highly successful entrepreneurs: Arthur Mensch, Co-founder & CEO of Mistral AI and John Elkann, CEO of Exor N.V. and Chairman of Ferrari and Stellantis. What did we discuss with them? Talent, corporate culture, trends, best practices, and even boldness‚Äîthe kind needed to create a successful European innovation and startup ecosystem. Stay tuned for more insights from the fireside chat between Arthur Mensch and John Elkann!\n\nToday we celebrate our #birthday! üéÇ In just two years since Vento's launch in March 2022, we've soared alongside the Italian startup ecosystem. Vento thrives on dual paths: Investments, backing early-stage startups with at least one Italian founder, and Venture Building, our annual program fostering about 40 founders to team up and kickstart innovative ventures. üìä Quick #highlights: Under #Investments, we've sifted through 2,400+ applications, investing in 60 startups. #VentureBuilding saw us evaluating 1,500 applications, choosing 110 talents, and launching 20 startups, with investments in 10. \"Vento is not just a catalyst for technological and entrepreneurial innovation but also a good sample of diversity within the startup community. Women represent 30% of the founders in our portfolio. This figure significantly exceeds industry averages and showcases Vento's commitment to inclusive growth.\" Diyala D'Aveni, Head of Vento. And now, as we blow out two candles, we can't wait to see what entrepreneurial stories we'll discover and cherish by our next birthday. For now, we look to the near #future, with the new Venture Building batch in full swing, and a new edition of #ItalianTechWeek on the horizon, set to bring some of the brightest minds in technology and entrepreneurship to OGR Torino. Thanks Fondazione CRT and Fondazione Compagnia di San Paolo for all the support through this two years, and thank you all for your wishes. And rest assured: the best is yet to come! #entrepreneurship #careers #innovation #startup\n\nExor N.V. becomes a long-term investor in Clarivate, endorsing the strategic direction set out by the Company‚Äôs Management and Board. The agreement also announces that Suzanne Heywood, COO of #Exor, will be nominated to stand for election to the Clarivate Board of Directors. ‚ÄúWe are delighted to be a shareholder of Clarivate, a global provider of data, analytics, #technology and expert services to several sectors including #healthcare.
