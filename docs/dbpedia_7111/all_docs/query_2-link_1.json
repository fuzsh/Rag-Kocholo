This is because, pursuant to disclosure rules and obligations on voting rights by the Financial Supervision Act, the AFM notification should include treasury shares in the calculation of voting rights. The table above excludes treasury shares because they are not part of Exor N.V.’s outstanding share capital and do not carry voting rights.\n\n(2)\n\nOrdinary shares held by third party investors based on latest data reported on the AFM (Dutch financial authority) website."
