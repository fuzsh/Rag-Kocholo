        "text": "Exor is a publicly listed investment vehicle of the Agnelli family (the founding family of Fiat which holds 53% in Exor). Its core holdings include reinsurance business PartnerRe (100%), Ferrari (23%), FiatChrysler (FCA) (29%), CNH (27%), Juventus football club (64%) and a number of smaller private investments. After a market correction in March 2020, its stock is down 33% and it is trading at a 40% discount to NAV (Net Asset Value measured as the sum of market values of its holdings less debt and head office costs), while key listed assets are themselves trading at depressed prices (down 50% on average, from their 2020 highs).\n\nExor offers over 100% upside if its listed assets recover to their normal values and the discount at which Exor's shares trade relative to the NAV disappears.\n\nExor has delivered 18.9% annual compound growth of NAV per share since it went public in 2009 beating MSCI World Index which grew 10.8% per year over the same time period. Total shareholder return was higher boosted by annual dividends (0.5-1% yield).\n\nFor the past 10 years, Exor has been led by a young, ambitious CEO – John Elkann who was groomed for this role by his grandfather – a legendary CEO of Fiat Gianni Agnelli. Elkann understands the crucial role of capital allocation for shareholder value creation and often refers to Berkshire Hathaway as a corporate model.\n\nThe second source of upside comes from the continued growth of NAV – should it match its historic average, Exor's NAV would double in four years.\n\nIn highly uncertain times of the pandemic, the additional benefits of holding Exor is the value of its wide network of contacts across Europe which should help it to find new attractive deals that are unavailable to an individual investor.\n\nExor's management as it takes a long-term view and focuses on building great businesses, paying special attention to corporate culture of its investee companies. The company has a strong alignment of interests between management, shareholders and holding companies.\n\nExor's market capitalisation is $12.9 which is less than the value of combined interest in four core listed businesses ($14.9bn). Exor's interest in the same four listed companies was worth $19.4bn pre-COVID pandemic (in February 2020). In addition to the listed assets, Exor has interests in private businesses, the largest of which is reinsurance company – PartnerRe. The European insurance company, Covea, made an offer in March 2020 to acquire PartnerRe for $9bn. Under the terms of the deal, PartnerRe will pay USD50mn of dividends to Exor before the deal is closed. Other private businesses have a fair value of $0.7bn, based on historical acquisition costs and/or average historic multiples.\n\nIn total, the current Gross Asset Value (GAV) of Exor is $24.6bn. After deducting net debt of $2.8bn and our estimated NPV of head office costs ($0.3bn), I arrive at market-based NAV of $21.5bn. Exor's shares outstanding (excluding shares bought during buyback from 2018) is 236.1mn. Exor NAV per share is EUR83.7.\n\nGiven sharp declines in market values of core companies since the start of the pandemic, I think it is more reasonable to use a normalised valuation for the listed assets. I think such values could be achieved when macro conditions recover and market psychology changes from fear to a more conservative optimism.\n\nUsing the same methodology, I arrive at $101.8 NAV per share which is 104% higher than the current share price of Exor.\n\nGiven the company's track record of achieving 18.9% compound annual growth rate for NAV per share, there is a good chance that Exor's NAV could materially increase in the future (e.g. it could double in 4 years at the past growth rate). This growth represents additional upside to valuation coming from re-rating of core businesses as the macro environment normalises.\n\nI think the current uncertain environment provides particularly attractive opportunities to deploy new capital for a company like Exor which has an extensive network of contacts among European businesses, bankers, private equities, regulators. $9.05bn of cash proceeds from the sale of PartnerRe as well as EUR1.6bn special dividend before completion of the FCA / Pegeuot Citroen (PSA) merger would be quite handy in this regard.\n\nMarket is focusing on short-term uncertainty (time arbitrage). While the final impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy remains unclear, I think the situation would normalise in the medium-term. It may take 6 months or 2-3 years, but it is unlikely that the world has changed for ever and the values of Exor's core businesses have been permanently impaired.\n\nI think investors may be paying too much attention to the possible risk of Covea walking away from the deal to acquire PartnerRe as well a risk of the FCA / PSA deal breaking up. I think the current price of Exor does not take into account the full price Covea is paying for PartnerRe as well as the benefits from the FCA/PSA merger. So even if neither of the deals goes ahead, the downside risks are quite low.\n\nExor is not just about a cyclical auto sector. The market mistakenly associates Exor with its traditional legacy business – FiatChrysler car manufacturer. In reality, FCA accounts for just 21% of Gross Asset Value, with Exor's asset portfolio having significantly diversified across different sectors and geographies. Ferrari accounts for a higher, 27%, of GAV. Even though Ferrari also produces auto cars, it is actually in the business of selling ultra luxury goods. It has the outstanding profitability (53% gross margin, 20% net income margin) thanks to a very strong brand, pricing power and super loyal customer base. PartnerRe which currently accounts for 37% of GAV provides Exor with an important float and cashflows.\n\nExposure to Europe / Italy. While Exor has indeed Italian roots, its business exposure is global. Ten years ago, two-thirds of its revenues were generated in Europe while today it is less than a third. US is the largest single market for majority of companies in its portfolio.\n\nExor does not have wide research coverage, while liquidity of its stock is fairly low. A typical large cap company in the US has 30 and in some cases 50 analysts following it (in addition to numerous articles on retail platforms). Exor is only covered by just 4 international brokers and 5 local brokers. Its daily average liquidity is about $20-25mn which is considerably less than the liquidity of more popular stocks which is often measured in 'hundreds' and 'billions'. With less investor focus, such significant undervaluation can exist. In other words, it is possible to buy an attractive portfolio of assets at a significantly discounted price."
