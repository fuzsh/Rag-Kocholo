        "text": "We are excited to announce that Anthropos has raised $2.7M to help companies build the workforce of the future using AI! We started Anthropos about a year ago with the strong idea that companies and employees are not aligned on their future, at a moment where skills are constantly changing and every business needs to move fast and build critical ones. How Anthropos works Anthropos has a modern approach: our platform engages employees and managers and allows them to map, verify and build critical skills with real-life scenarios and a level of customization that is really key for any business. The result is that companies can use Anthropos to truly build the engine to run knowledge, skills and development inside their organization. Today we are also launching a few more examples of our AI Job Simulations to show how powerful this approach can be. Why adopting Anthropos today Anthropos is our way of reimagining the connection between people and companies as both adapt to a new way of working. People are more ambitious than ever but they are not ok staying in roles and companies that don’t invest in their growth, with values they don’t share. Similarly for companies: skills are changing so rapidly that looking for the right people is the biggest investment in the budget while retaining the existing talent is always a trial and error process. Our thesis is that both parties could use a different solution to solve this problem. We would like to say thank you to our lead investor Founderful with Alex Stöckl and Antonia Albert - they believed in us from 1st meeting and simply taught us how impactful it is to have someone really understanding founders. we also want to thank Eden Ventures (Leonardo Giagnoni and Giovanni Strocchi are amazing), Zanichelli Venture (working with such a name and with Enrico Poli is an honor), Exor Ventures and alessandro rivetti + several friends in the US and EU that believed in us along the way, some of them have backed Giacomo and I in multiple ventures and we couldn't be more grateful! Last but not least, our customers are the real heroes here (thank you BYTEK | the martech of Datrix group among the others, they have trusted us very early in the journey!) and so is our amazing team of people. We couldn’t be here without them. If you have a company and want to try Anthropos, we have a free trial available on our website! We would love to help you setup a modern platform to guide, upskill and transform your people with your needs in mind. Read more on Forbes today https://lnkd.in/dnugEykZ"
