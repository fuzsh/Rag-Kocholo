I have petitioned the court to legally change my name and I was born in North Carolina. What should I do next?\n\n2. I have petitioned the court to legally change my name, but I was not born in North Carolina. What should I do next?\n\nPlease contact the vital records office in the jurisdiction where you were born.â¯ The North Carolina Office of Vital Records does not administer your birth record.\n\n3. I have initiated an adoption proceeding for an adoptee who was not born in North Carolina, but was born in another United States vital records jurisdiction. What should I do next?\n\nPlease contact the vital records office in the jurisdiction where the child was born. The North Carolina Office of Vital Records does not administer the birth record.\n\n4. I completed an Affidavit of Parentage for Child Born out of Wedlock at the medical facility where my child was born, at a local health department, or at the state or local vital records office. What happens next?\n\n5. I completed an Affidavit of Parentage for Child Born out of Wedlock with the biological father of my child born in NC. Why is the fatherâs name not shown on my childâs birth certificate?\n\nA possible reason for this omission is that when a mother is legally married at the time of either conception or birth, NC law requires a court order to add the biological fatherâs name on the childâs birth record. The order must also find that husband is not the father of the child. Other reasons could include that there was a father on the record prior to submission of the Affidavit of Parentage.\n\n6. How do I remove a parent listed on a birth certificate?\n\nNC law requires a court order to remove a parent from a birth certificate. A DNA Parentage Test Report is not sufficient documentation to provide to this office to remove a parent from a childâs certificate of birth.\n\n7.
