        "text": "They're known as pop sensations. Superstars. Rappers. Singers. Grammy winners. Dancers. Celebrities. But who are the Black Eyed Peas, really? You might not guess it, but the four people who make up the Peas have come a long way. We looked at what's behind their towering fame, outlandish stage antics and madcap personas, and found stories laced with poverty, addiction and hardship.\n\napl.de.ap\n\nwww.apldeap.com\n\nReal name: Allan Pineda Lindo.\n\nBorn: 1974 in the Philippines.\n\nBeginnings: He lived in the Philippines with his Filipino mom until age 11, working as a farm hand to help his family. His absentee dad was an African-American serviceman. Under a Pearl S. Buck Foundation sponsorship, his mom sent him to the U.S. at age 11 for treatment for an eye problem. Escaping poverty in his homeland, he was adopted by an American at 14 and remains in the U.S.\n\nMusic career:Apl met will.i.am in school, and they were soon writing raps and dancing together. They formed a break-dancing crew that quickly became popular. His musical partnership with will.i.am has lasted from their first group, Atban Klann, to the Black Eyed Peas. Remembering his day job of picking up horse manure at Disneyland keeps him \"grounded,\" he recently told CBS. Last year, with his bandmates' support, he launched his own record label, Jeepney Music, with the motto \"You Can Dream.\" (Jeepneys, made from U.S. military WWII Jeeps, are used for public transportation in the Philippines.) The label features artists from all over the world, particularly those in developing countries. Last year, apl released his first two solo singles, \"You Can Dream\" and \"Mama Filipina,\" and a music video, \"Take Me to the Phillippines,\" which was a collaboration between the Philippines' Department of Tourism and MTV.\n\nCharity work: The Apl Foundation hosts concerts and other events to benefit charities in Asia, including the Pearl S. Buck Foundation that sponsored him as a child. After a devastating typhoon in the Philippines last year, he led a relief campaign to help survivors.\n\nFergie\n\nwww.fergie.com\n\nReal name: Stacy Ann Ferguson.\n\nBorn: 1975 in Hacienda Heights, Calif.\n\nBeginnings: Fergie told The Times of London newspaper she had a strict Catholic upbringing, and was a straight-A student and a Girl Scout. Her parents were teachers.\n\nFirst concert: She told Rolling Stone her first concert experience was seeing Tina Turner, where she sat in the second row with her dad. She was 6. Her memory: \"She pointed at me. That was big.\"\n\nActing: Her career started in the early 1980s when she provided the voice of Sally in Charlie Brown television specials. Before long, she landed a spot on \"Kids Incorporated\" alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt and Mario Lopez. She also appeared in a \"Married ... With Children\" episode. More recently, she had roles in the movies \"Nine,\" \"Poseidon\" and \"Grindhouse.\"\n\nMusic career: She formed her first band, the all-girl Wild Orchid, with other \"Kids Incorporated\" alumni. The group released two albums and hosted a lip-syncing game show, \"Great Pretenders,\" before Fergie sank into a crystal methamphetamine addiction, which she widely says was triggered by childhood fame burdens. After hitting a rough bottom, including spending all her money made as a child actress, she was able to quit, she told Rolling Stone. She is not an original member of the Black Eyed Peas. The first female vocalist, Kim Hill, left the group and Fergie joined in 2003. Since then, she has been a part of three Peas albums and released a solo album.\n\nwill.i.am\n\nwww.will-i-am.com\n\nReal name: William James Adams Jr.\n\nBorn: 1975 in Los Angeles.\n\nBeginnings: Will.i.am told Tavis Smiley in an interview, \"I had a great childhood ... I should be in jail, right? ... the only thing that got me off that path was the friends I had in school, and the schools I went to, the teachers...\" He told Blender Magazine he grew up in a mostly Mexican neighborhood, never knew his dad and was raised by his mom, who had him bused out of the projects to attend school in a wealthy area.\n\nFashion: He never put music aside but did go to the Fashion Institute of Design in Los Angeles before his musical success. He now has a clothing line, \"i.am,\" has designed a denim collection, \"i.am Antik,\" and has designed clothes for the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nRap name:He first called himself Will-1X. His mom first heard the name when someone yelled at him as they walked down the street, and she disapproved, he told Gayle King. He joked about his mom questioning what \"1X\" meant - and how he had no answer. At about 18, he realized his name could be divided into a phrase that defines him.\n\nMusic career: Will.i.am and fellow Peas member apl.de.ap have been best friends since high school. They had a group called Atban Klann, which was signed by Eazy-E to Ruthless Records, but their recordings were never released. After Eazy-E's death, will.i.am and apl formed the Black Eyed Peas. They recruited Taboo and released two albums before their big hit, \"Elephunk.\" He has dabbled in producing, acting and solo music projects, and became politically vocal in 2008 during President Obama's campaign.\n\nTaboo\n\nwww.taboo.blackeyedpeas.com\n\nReal name: Jaime Luis Gomez.\n\nBorn: 1975 in East Los Angeles.\n\nBeginnings: In an interview with the now defunct Lip Magazine, he said, \"Growing up in East Los Angeles, I learned about [being comfortable] without having money. I learned that happiness was our form of financial stability.\" Gomez is Mexican-American, and though he now proudly displays his heritage, he told Latina Magazine he was once embarrassed by his real name because he worried others would think he was a \"wetback.\"\n\nFinding hip-hop: In the same interview, he said he grew up listening to more Latin music than hip-hop. The first hip-hop song he heard was on the radio: \"The Message\" by Melle Mel.\n\nDance: Best known as a break dancer, he said in the Latina interview that he grew up doing cumbias, quebraditas, salsa, merengue and other Latin dances at quinceaneras. He called his grandmother his biggest dancing influence, and he also learned martial arts, which he incorporates in his style.\n\nMusic career: Taboo met bandmates will.i.am and apl through a break-dancing circle at a Los Angeles club scene. He joined the Black Eyed Peas in 1995, and was a \"hype man\" at first, he told Latina. His role has since grown into being an MC and songwriter. In addition to his work with the Peas, he is rumored to be working on a solo project and occasionally collaborates with other Hispanic artists.\n\nActing: He was in \"Dirty\" with Wyclef Jean; an indie film, \"Cosmic Radio;\" and in last year's \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.\""
