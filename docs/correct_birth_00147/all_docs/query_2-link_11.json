        "text": "Will Smith\n\nAmerican actor and musician\n\nByname of:\n\nWillard Carroll Smith, Jr.\n\nBorn:\n\nSeptember 25, 1968, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. (age 55)\n\nAwards And Honors:\n\nGolden Globe Award (2022)\n\nAcademy Award (2022)\n\nGrammy Award (1998)\n\nGrammy Award (1997)\n\nGrammy Award (1991)\n\nGrammy Award (1988)\n\nEmmy Award (2016): Outstanding Comedy Series\n\nEmmy Award (2015): Outstanding Comedy Series\n\nGrammy Award (1999): Best Rap Solo Performance\n\nGrammy Award (1998): Best Rap Solo Performance\n\nGrammy Award (1992): Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group\n\nGrammy Award (1989): Best Rap Performance\n\nWill Smith (born September 25, 1968, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.) is an American actor and musician whose charisma and quick wit helped him transition from rap music to a successful career in acting. Smith’s notable films include the blockbusters Bad Boys (1995), Independence Day (1996), and Men in Black (1997). For his work in King Richard (2021), he received the Academy Award for best actor.\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince\n\nSmith was given the nickname “Prince Charming” in high school, which he adapted to “Fresh Prince” in order to reflect a more hip-hop sound when he began his musical career. He formed an alliance with schoolmate and deejay Jeffrey Townes, whom he met in 1981. They began recording as DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince and released their first single, “Girls Ain’t Nothing but Trouble,” in 1986, later followed by the album Rock the House. In 1988 the group released the groundbreaking single “Parents Just Don’t Understand,” which went on to win a Grammy Award (the first Grammy ever presented in the rap performance category).\n\nFresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nSmith’s act, notable for its wide crossover appeal, was sometimes characterized as “light rap” because of the lack of hard-core lyrics and themes in his compositions. Platinum-certified recordings and accompanying videos subsequently brought him to the attention of television producers. The television sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which began in 1990, was loosely based on Smith’s real-life persona. It ran on NBC for six successful seasons, ending at the star’s request, and during its run Smith garnered two Golden Globe Award nominations and served as an executive producer for the final season.\n\nMovie stardom: Bad Boys, Independence Day, and Ali\n\nBuoyed by his small-screen success, Smith expanded into cinema with Where the Day Takes You (1992). His first leading role was in the film version of John Guare’s successful stage play Six Degrees of Separation (1993). The action comedy-thriller Bad Boys (1995), however, proved to be the turning point in his film career. While the movie was not a critical success, it made more than $100 million worldwide, proving Smith’s star power. In 1996 he starred in that year’s top-grossing movie, Independence Day. He was a hit at the box office again the next year with the science-fiction comedy Men in Black, for which he also recorded the Grammy-winning title song; sequels to the film appeared in 2002 and 2012. Also in 1997 Smith released his first solo album, Big Willie Style, which included the hit “Gettin’ Jiggy wit It,” and he followed it two years later with Willennium.\n\nAfter starring in the dramatic thriller Enemy of the State (1998), Smith continued to demonstrate his remarkable versatility as an actor, playing an enigmatic golf caddy in The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000); the boxer Muhammad Ali in the biopic Ali (2001), for which he received an Academy Award nomination; a cop from the near future in I, Robot (2004); and a “date doctor” helping a romantically inept man find love in Hitch (2005). The next year he starred in The Pursuit of Happyness, and his performance as a single father who overcomes adversity earned him a second Oscar nomination for best actor. In I Am Legend (2007), Smith appeared as a scientist who is perhaps the last human on Earth following an epidemic. Hancock (2008) featured Smith as a superhero trying to revamp his unpopular image, and in Seven Pounds (2008) he played a man seeking redemption after accidentally killing seven people in a car accident.\n\nLater films and Oscar win\n\nSmith later starred—alongside his son Jaden—in the science-fiction epic After Earth (2013), which was based on an idea he conceived. In 2015 Smith portrayed a con artist in the thriller Focus and the doctor who discovered the epidemic of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among NFL players in Concussion. In 2016 he played the assassin Deadshot in the action thriller Suicide Squad and a grieving father in Collateral Beauty. The following year he starred as a police officer in the Netflix action film Bright, which is set in a Los Angeles inhabited by humans and mythical creatures. Smith then was cast as the genie in the family comedy Aladdin (2019). He played two roles in Gemini Man (2019): a retired assassin and his younger clone, the latter a digitally recreated version of Smith in his 20s. Smith’s other credits from 2019 included the animated Spies in Disguise, in which he supplied the voice of a spy who is turned into a pigeon.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 2021 Smith took the title role in King Richard, a biopic about the father of tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams. For his performance, Smith received the Oscar for best actor in 2022. However, his win was partly overshadowed by an incident during the ceremony. When comedian Chris Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, actress Jada Pinkett Smith (married 1997), Smith took offense. He walked onstage and slapped Rock, then swore at him. Smith subsequently apologized to Rock. Later in 2022 Smith starred in Antoine Fuqua’s Emancipation, a drama set during the American Civil War. Smith played an enslaved man who flees the brutality of a Confederate railroad camp. Two years later he appeared in Bad Boys: Ride or Die.\n\nOther activities\n\nSmith continued his recording career with the albums Born to Reign (2002) and Lost and Found (2005), but they failed to match the success of his previous releases. In addition, in the early 21st century Smith served as a producer for several films, including some in which he acted, and with his wife he helped create and produce the sitcom All of Us (2003–07). In 2018 he hosted the documentary TV series One Strange Rock, about Earth. Smith’s memoir, Will (written with Mark Manson), was released in 2021.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
