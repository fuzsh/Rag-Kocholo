(Estate Recovery)\n\nHow is the NJ FamilyCare health plan appeal process changing?\n\nBeginning July 1, 2017, the New Jersey Managed Care Organization appeal process for denials of health care services will be different because of changes to the federal rules that the managed care health plans must follow. The managed care health plans and the State know the new rules. You should know that, if you request an appeal or Medicaid Fair Hearing for health care services on or after July 1, 2017, your health plan will guide you through the process. Click here for more answers to questions you may have.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat does it mean that I have to renew my insurance every 12 months?\n\nRenewal is simply a way of checking to see if anything has changed in your family's situation. You may be sent a preprinted form to confirm your household size, or you may be sent a blank application to fill out. It is very important that you respond to any written request so your insurance coverage will not be lost or interrupted.\n\nback to top\n\nIs it true that my child must be without health insurance for 3 months before they can be eligible for NJ FamilyCare?\n\nNo, this is not true anymore. There is no waiting period before your children are eligible for NJ FamilyCare.\n\nback to top\n\nI have a job out of state. The health insurance I receive is not accessible to my family. Will they qualify for NJ FamilyCare in spite of the fact that I have insurance?\n\nYes, if your health insurance is not accessible to your family, they may be eligible for NJ FamilyCare.\n\nback to top\n\nCan a single adult qualify for the NJ FamilyCare program?\n\nAll adults age 19-64 with income up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level can apply for NJ FamilyCare. In general, immigrant adults must have Legal Permanent Resident status in the United States for at least five years in order to qualify for NJ FamilyCare. Some immigrant adults can qualify if they are lawfully present, regardless of when they entered the US. Immigrants age 19 and 20 who are lawfully present and have very low income can also qualify.\n\nback to top\n\nIf I am an adult without dependent children and had a prior criminal offense which was classified as a felony or crime involving the possession, use, or distribution of a controlled substance, can I still get childless adult Medicaid coverage?\n\nPrior to January 1, 2014: The Division does not directly consider any prior offense involving possession, use, or distribution of controlled substances in a Medicaid eligibility determination; however, currently, being eligible for Work First New Jersey/General Assistance (WFNJ/GA) is a requirement to become eligible for childless adult Medicaid coverage. The WFNJ/GA eligibility rules provide that if an adult without dependent children has a conviction that involves possession or use of a controlled substance, that person can become eligible for WFNJ/GA only if they enroll in and complete a licensed residential drug treatment program and undergo drug testing during the treatment program and for 60 days thereafter. A failed drug test will cause WFNJ/GA benefits to terminate, and this would affect Medicaid eligibility. The WFNJ/GA eligibility rules also provide that if an adult without dependent children was convicted of distribution of a controlled substance, the person cannot ever qualify for WFNJ/GA.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2014: Federal rules permit states to offer Medicaid eligibility to adults without dependent children, outside of the WFNJ/GA program. Therefore, prior drug convictions for possession, use or distribution of controlled substances will no longer be a factor in Medicaid eligibility.\n\nback to top\n\nHow long do I have to live in the United States before I can be eligible for NJ FamilyCare?\n\nChildren under 19 can qualify for NJ FamilyCare regardless of their immigration status. Pregnant women who are lawfully present can qualify, regardless of the date that they entered the United States. In general, immigrant adults must have Legal Permanent Resident status in the United States for at least five years in order to qualify for NJ FamilyCare. Some immigrant adults can qualify if they are lawfully present, regardless of when they entered the US. Immigrants age 19 and 20 who are lawfully present and have very low income can also qualify.\n\nback to top\n\nI don't speak English very well, and I am afraid to call.\n\nNJ FamilyCare's 800 number is linked with a translation service. Whatever your native language is, we will arrange to have a third person on the line who can speak your language. They will be there to interpret for you and the Health Benefits Coordinator. Don't be afraid! Call 1-800-701-0710!\n\nback to top\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nThere are several ways you can apply:\n\nWe strongly encourage you to Apply Online. If you need help with your online application or if you want to complete an application over the phone, call toll free 1-800-701-0710 and a Health Benefits Coordinator will help you.\n\nIf you prefer to have face to face assistance, click on the Need Help Enrolling link of this web site and select your county to find a list of agencies in your area that can help. Choose a site that offers personal assistance and they will be able to help you apply.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 crisis, some offices may not be open. Please call before visiting. An online or phone application will be the best way to apply during this time.\n\nback to top\n\nCan I apply at my County Welfare Agency?\n\nYes, you can. Actually, if your income is low at this time, it would be a very good idea to apply at a County Welfare Agency. There is a possibility that you might be eligible for other programs, such as food stamps. The representatives at the County Welfare Agency will be able to help you. You can find your County Welfare Agency's address and telephone number by going to \"Need help enrolling?\" and click on your county of residence. They will be listed there.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 crisis, some offices may not be open. Please call before visiting.\n\nback to top\n\nI cannot make up my mind as to which Health Plan to select. What should I do?\n\nFirst you should check out the list of NJ FamilyCare Health Plans, and see which are available in your County. Then you should contact your family doctor to see if he or she is participating in one of those Health Plans - be sure to specify NJ FamilyCare when you ask. If your doctor does not participate in an NJ FamilyCare Health Plan, we recommend that you call 1-800-701-0710 to have one of our Health Benefits Coordinators assist you. Select a Health Plan even if you are not sure. Not choosing a Health Plan will SLOW DOWN your application process. Once your family members are enrolled in NJ FamilyCare, you will have an opportunity to change your Health Plan at a later date, if you are not satisfied.\n\nback to top\n\nDo I need to make a monthly payment (known as premium) for NJ FamilyCare?\n\nAs of July 1, 2021, premiums are no longer required for NJ FamilyCare (this includes all Plans). However, any unpaid premium balance is still due.\n\nback to top\n\nCan I keep the same doctor I have now?\n\nYes, if your doctor participates in one of the Health Plans providing services for NJ FamilyCare in that county. Call your doctor and ask if he or she is providing services for NJ FamilyCare and if so, under which HMO. Then choose that HMO as your Health Plan.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat if my family makes too much money to qualify for NJ FamilyCare?\n\nNJ residents at higher income levels can purchase health insurance through GetCoveredNJ, the State Marketplace, at www.getcovered.nj.gov.\n\nback to top\n\nWhat if I'm pregnant?\n\nNJ FamilyCare covers low income pregnant women too! Apply online or visit your local County Welfare Agency. Contact the respective local County Welfare Agency in your area.\n\nPregnant women already enrolled in NJ FamilyCare should contact 1-800-701-0710 and advise them of your pregnancy. NJ FamilyCare wants to be sure you are receiving all of the benefits that your pregnancy entitles you to.\n\nback to top\n\nIf I enroll in the new expanded NJ FamilyCare program, when I die and try to leave something to my kids, can the government put a lien on my assets to repay the benefits I received? (Estate Recovery)\n\nIn the case of an NJ FamilyCare beneficiary who became deceased on or after April 1, 1995 for whom payments for services were made on or after October 1, 1993, a lien may be filed against and recovery sought from the estate of the deceased recipient for assistance correctly paid or to be paid on his or her behalf for all services received when he or she was 55 years of age or older. There are some exceptions.
