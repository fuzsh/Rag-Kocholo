Secure browsers allow you to communicate with our application in a protected session.\n\nWhen you use the application a dialog is established with our server while you complete the form. It is terminated and the information is deleted when you exit the application or after 30 minutes of inactivity. The Internet Protocol (IP) address of computers used may be collected but the IP is not linked to the identity of an individual.\n\nIf you submit an application electronically, the information you enter will be sent to the Office of the Registrar General when you select the Submit button.\n\nThe minimum PC browser requirements required to use these forms are capable of supporting TLS 1.2 encryption protocols. This includes the following:\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer version 11.0 or higher\n\nMozilla Firefox version 27.0 or higher\n\nGoogle Chrome version 38.0 or higher\n\nSafari 7.0 or higher\n\nTo determine the version you are using on your current browser, from the browser Help menu, select About. A window will open providing version number for your browser\n\nTo download a more recent version of your browser that is compatible with the Online Certificate Application, use the following websites:\n\nBrowser Website Internet Explorer: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17621/internet-explorer-downloads Mozilla Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ Google Chrome https://www.google.com/chrome/ Safari https://support.apple.com/en-ca/safari\n\nThe Online Certificate Application automatically encrypts all your confidential information in transit from your computer to ours using the Transport Layer Security (TLS). To verify your session is secure, on your browser look for:\n\nhttps: in the URL address line.\n\nA \"secure\" symbol (closed padlock or key) on the status bar of your browser, located on the lower right portion of the browser window. Note: The status bar must be enabled for you to see the padlock or key.\n\nTo speed up web browsing, internet browsers are designed to download web pages and store them locally on your machine in an area called \"cache\". To ensure that no personal information is stored, it is advisable to clear the cache on the personal computer you are using. To clear the cache on your browser, please visit your browser's help section or support page for details.\n\nA cookie is a small bit of information given to your browser by a web site, which can later be retrieved. A cookie is a way for a web site to recognize if you have visited the site before. The cookie can only be read by the web site that \"set\" the cookie. Cookies can be \"session cookies\" or \"persistent cookies\". A session cookie is a cookie that is temporarily stored in your computer's memory. Session cookies are normally deleted from a user's computer when the user logs off the computer, or the user exits the browser. A persistent cookie is a cookie that is stored permanently on your workstation and is reused each time you visit the web site.\n\nWe use non-persistent session cookies. This helps us establish a 'session' or 'dialog' between you and our server when you begin using the Online Application. Once the session is established, the Office of the Registrar General is able to tailor its responses to help you complete your application in the most efficient and effective manner possible. The session cookie is deleted when our server does not receive any further requests from your computer. For example, session cookies are deleted when you exit your browser, or after 30 minutes of user inactivity.\n\nWhat is a search?\n\nIf you do not know the exact date of an event (birth, marriage or death), you may request a search. A search verifies that an event has taken place and has been registered with the province of Ontario. There is a $15.00 fee for each period of up to 5 years you request to have searched.\n\nWhat address should I provide on the application?\n\nProvide the address where you want the Office of the Registrar General to send the documents. If you have a Post Office box, you must also provide an address with a street name and number. You are only required to use the Delivery Mode and Route number fields if you live in a rural area.\n\nMy name contains letters with accents. How do I enter these characters?\n\nEnsure Num Lock is on.\n\nHold down the Alt key and type the number listed below using the Numeric Keypad on the right side of your keyboard.\n\nWhen you release the Alt key, the character will appear.\n\nALT codes for accented letters Character Press Alt + type à 133 â 131 ä 132 ç 135 Ç 128 é 130 É 144 è 138 ê 136 ë 137 î 140 ï 139 ô 147 ö 148 ù 151 û 150 ü 129\n\nWhat do I do if I experience a technical problem and the information I have entered on the form is erased?\n\nYour information is lost and you will have to re-enter the information.\n\nWhat if I submitted an application form by mail/fax/in person and now want to submit it online - will I get a refund?\n\nEvery person who submits an application for a certificate and thereby requests that a service be performed by the Office of the Registrar General must pay the required fee.\n\nIf you submitted multiple applications for a birth certificate, all applications will be processed, however, multiple certificates will not be issued. Only the most recently issued birth certificate and certified copy of the birth registration will be valid. Any previous copies will be deactivated. As processing has occurred, you are not eligible for a refund.\n\nIf you submitted multiple applications for a marriage or death certificate, all applications will be processed. As there is no restriction on the number of marriage or death certificates a person may apply for, processing has occurred and you are not eligible for a refund.\n\nI applied for one certificate but I was billed for two - will I get a refund?\n\nIf you did not submit multiple applications, whether by mail, in person or online, and you have been charged more than once, you may submit a Request for Refund form for evaluation.\n\nFor information call:\n\n1-800-461-2156 (outside Toronto but within North America)\n\n416-325-8305 (in Toronto or outside North America)\n\n416-325-3408 (TTY/Teletypewriter)\n\nOnline Application Information\n\nWhat is a Premium Online Service?\n\nWhere rush service is required for a birth, death, or marriage certificate, customers may be able to apply for the Premium Online Service option. Eligible applications (see Terms and Conditions) are processed and delivered within 5 business days. Where applications are eligible for premium processing, a $30.00 surcharge will be applied per document requested.\n\nNote: At this time Service Guarantees are not available for a Birth Certificate with Parental Information.\n\nCan I review my completed online application before I submit it online?\n\nThere are a number of opportunities to review sections but you cannot see all of the information at once. The Office of the Registrar General does not provide a method by which you may review your application online. Upon successful submission of your online application, you will be presented with a payment receipt. The payment receipt includes information about the products you selected, and your order and payment confirmation numbers. The Office of the Registrar General recommends that you print the payment receipt for your records.\n\nIs my information sent online?\n\nAfter your credit card has been charged, your information is sent electronically to the Office of the Registrar General.\n\nCan I electronically save the application I send online?\n\nNo. There is no method by which you may save your application electronically.

If yes, you must provide their previous legal names. A legal name change involves legally changing a person's first name(s) and/or last name or single name. When your name is legally changed in Ontario, you are issued a birth certificate indicating the new legal name(s).\n\nWhat type of birth document is required to obtain a Canadian passport, social insurance number (SIN), Ontario Health Card (OHIP number), or Ontario driver's licence?\n\nPlease visit the following websites to determine what type of certificate you require:\n\nCanadian Passport:\n\nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/passport/\n\nSocial Insurance Number:\n\nhttp://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sin/apply/proof.shtml\n\nOntario Driver's Licence:\n\nhttp://www.drivetest.ca/licences/id-documents.html\n\nOntario Health Card:\n\nhttp://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/publications/ohip/card.aspx\n\nWhat is the difference between a Birth Certificate, a Birth Certificate with Parental Information and a Certified copy of a Birth Registration?\n\nA birth certificate is a legal document used to provide an identity. The birth must be registered before a birth certificate can be issued. There are three types of birth products available. Make sure you order the right certificate!\n\nA Birth Certificate is an extract of information from the original birth registration and contains the following information:\n\nSubject name\n\nSubject date of birth\n\nCertificate Number\n\nBirthplace\n\nSex\n\nDate of Registration\n\nRegistration number\n\nDate issued\n\nA Birth Certificate contains personal information of the subject only, and is recommended for those over the age of 16 and can be used to obtain other government documentation, such as:\n\nAdult general passport\n\nSocial Insurance Number\n\nOntario driver's licence\n\nOntario Health Card\n\nA Birth Certificate with Parental Information is an extract of information from the original birth registration and contains the following information:\n\nSubject name\n\nSubject date of birth\n\nCertificate Number\n\nBirthplace\n\nSex\n\nDate of Registration\n\nRegistration number\n\nDate issued\n\nParent(s) name(s)\n\nParent(s) place(s) of birth\n\n*Note: For older (pre-1970) registrations, parent(s)' place(s) of birth may not have been recorded and therefore will not appear on the certificate.\n\nThis certificate includes parental information, in addition to the subject's information and is recommended for newborns or children under 16 years of age where parental information is required and can be used for the same identification purposes as a birth certificate with only subject information.\n\nChild general passport\n\nChild health insurance\n\nCertain immigration or citizenship applications\n\nA Certified Copy of the Birth Registration contains the following information:\n\nSubject name\n\nSubject date of birth\n\nBirthplace (city, town, village, municipality)\n\nSex\n\nLocation of birth (hospital, birthing centre, etc.,)\n\nParent(s) name(s)\n\nParent(s) date(s) of birth\n\nParent mailing address at the time of birth\n\nDuration of the pregnancy\n\nNumber of children born to this mother\n\nParent(s) place(s) of birth\n\nWeight of the child at birth\n\nType of birth (single, multiple, etc.,)\n\nAttendant at the birth\n\nDate of Registration\n\nRegistration number\n\nDate issued\n\nA certified copy of the detailed registration filed after birth, also known as the Statement of Live Birth, contains all registered information about a birth. The copy is endorsed as authentic, printed on legal sized paper, and contains a raised seal for security and verification purposes.\n\nAs a historical record of the birth, a certified copy contains any changes that have been made to the birth registration including any name changes and corrections to information contained on the birth registration. The certified copy of a birth registration can be used for identification purposes requiring more detailed information such as for:\n\nApplying for Indian Status\n\nAdopting a child abroad\n\nCertain immigration or citizenship applications\n\nVisa applications\n\nSafeguarding your personal and sensitive information is important. Given the amount of information contained in a Certified Copy of a Birth Registration it is not recommended to share this document unless expressly required.\n\nI am an adoptee or adoptive parent. What information do I need to provide?\n\nWhen completing the application, provide the adoptive parents names and the current legal name of the adoptee.\n\nCan a family member or relative be a guarantor?\n\nYes, provided that he or she is a Canadian citizen, has known you for two or more years and his or her occupation appears on the list of qualified guarantors.\n\nHistorical events, such as births prior to 1930, may not be in electronic format. When applying for a birth certificate for a birth prior to 1930, it can take up to an extra 6-8 weeks for the registration to be converted into electronic format before processing can be completed. Records that are not available electronically are not included in the Service Guarantee.\n\nHow do I obtain a birth certificate that does not display the sex designation field?\n\nAnyone with an Ontario birth registration has the option to request a birth certificate or birth certificate with parental information that does not display the sex designation field. This option does not change the birth registration - it just means the sex designation field will not appear on the birth certificate.\n\nYou can request a birth certificate or a birth certificate with parental information that does not display the sex designation field by mail or fax. Please select the following link to learn more about the necessary form and mailing/fax information to obtain a birth certificate that does not display the sex designation field.\n\nNote: A birth certificate with no sex displayed is valid and recognized by the Government of Ontario. Ontario does not endorse the rejection of Ontario birth certificates; however, the Government of Ontario cannot guarantee that an Ontario birth certificate with no sex displayed will be accepted by organizations in Ontario or by other jurisdictions.\n\nHow do I obtain a birth certificate with an X, a non-binary sex designation, in the sex designation field?\n\nTo apply for a certificate with an X, a change of sex designation to an X, a non-binary sex designation, is required. Anyone with an Ontario birth registration may apply to change their sex designation on their birth registration so it matches with their gender identity. You can then request a birth certificate or a birth certificate with parental information that displays the updated sex designation or a certified copy of a birth registration by mail or fax. Please select the following link to learn more about changing the sex designation on a birth registration and obtaining a birth certificate.\n\nNote: A birth certificate with a sex designation of X is valid and recognized by the Government of Ontario.
