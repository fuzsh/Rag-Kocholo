In most cases, certificates can be obtained from the Register of Deeds on the same day.\n\nNote: NC Vital Records is the only office from which you may obtain a birth certificate for an adopted child.\n\nCurrent NC Vital Vital Records processing times for regular certificate requests that do not involve changes/amendments."
