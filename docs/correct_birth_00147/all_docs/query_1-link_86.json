        "text": "Installed in a smart London hotel suite, will.i.am confesses that he can barely remember the last time he slept anywhere other than on an aeroplane. \"A lot of my sleeping these days is done mid-air because I'm travelling so much,\" he says, though if he is currently jet-lagged he's doing a great job of hiding it: throughout our chat his energy levels remain typically high.\n\n\"But at the moment I'm in the UK a lot ahead of The Voice so it should improve.\"\n\nThis will be the second series of the ITV talent competition in which seven-to-14-year-olds sing for a panel of judges headed by Will and including pop stars Pixie Lott and McFly's Danny Jones, and he confesses that he loves the kids' version of the show even more than the adult one.\n\n\"I get greater emotional enjoyment out of it,\" he says. \"It's magnetic. It also turns out that they're a lot stronger, a lot more resilient than their parents who are the ones blubbing in the wings.\"\n\nHe's also very good with the children, both on and off camera, perhaps because they can relate to his natural ebullience but also, he says, because of the influence of his own mum Debra.\n\n\"She taught me to behave properly. She sent me to a good school an hour-and-a-half away by coach and made sure I always wore my uniform.\"\n\nShe also knew how to control her lively son - and she wouldn't let the doctors prescribe Ritalin for his ultimately diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \"My mother's EQ - that's emotional quotient - is off the charts. She instinctively knew how to read me without scarring me emotionally,\" he says.\n\n\"She'd discipline me, she was real strict. But she'd inform me why she was disciplining me without me ever stopping loving her for one moment. She'd say, 'Here's why you're getting hit' which made me understand why she was doing what she did.\"\n\nWill has never met his Jamaican father but there were strong male role models in his life courtesy of his mother's four brothers: Roger, Faye, Donny and Lynn, a successful American football player. \"I'm closest to Uncle Donny. It's always, 'Happy Father's Day, Uncle Donny!' That's how I think of him. When I'm back in LA, I live with my Uncle Donny. He's my room-mate.\"\n\nAsk him if he can imagine having his own kids one day and he doesn't hesitate, claiming: \"I've got 600.\" These turn out to be the students at Boyle Heights College in LA where he underwrites a scholarship programme.\n\nHe's not being entirely flippant. His mother had four children of her own and adopted four more. Her job was helping to run a children's after-school programme.\n\n\"So when you have a mum who has other kids that are not hers biologically but to whom she is emotionally invested and when you've never seen your dad, what does that teach you about parenting?\n\nwill.i.am on being a big kid\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What runs deeper is the spirit and the love and the commitment to being that guardian and mentor to a child. That said, the day I do have biological kids you're not going to know about it. You won't see them on Instagram. No way am I going to be pimping out my freakin' children. Why would I do that?\"\n\nIt's safe to say Will is a man of contrasts: the defiantly single man who is nevertheless deeply invested in the importance of parenting, the frontman of the Black Eyed Peas who is also a businessman with an empire reputedly worth Â£55million, the fashion icon who confesses to collecting spectacles and has just designed a range for Specsavers, and the LA native having a love affair with the UK.\n\n\"Is Britain like my second home?\" he says. \"No, it's my first. LA's now my second home. I'm usually in the UK 10 days a month but only five a month in LA on average. The other 15 days I'm in New York, the Middle East, China, San Francisco.\n\n\"I like London best. The traffic sucks but I feel at home here. They say that Londoners are snobby but that's not my experience. I think they're friendly. And I can't even imagine a robbery with an English accent. It would sound too polite.\"\n\nThe contrasts continue: he drives a Tesla Model S \"because it's the best car on the Earth\" but confesses that the most expensive he has ever bought is his Bentley GT coupe. \"It's in my garage in LA I don't drive it any more because it's not as fast as the Tesla.\"\n\nThis embracing of contradictions extends to his upbringing. Born in Eastside Los Angeles he was raised in the rough Estrada Courts housing projects in Boyle Heights, where he and his mother were among the few African-American families in a mostly Hispanic community. He remembers it now as \"violent\" but also \"full of love\".\n\n\"I grew up in a violent Mexican neighbourhood of gang fights and drive-by shootings,\" he says. \"And yet I remember it as the most lovely time. I know that sounds weird. Every week, every month, somebody got shot. But all the while it was the best childhood because there was so much love in the community.\n\nEveryone looked out for everyone else. The gangs fought each other. But we were all tight.\n\nWill.I.Am: Kanye's slavery statement broke my heart\n\nMy grandma's grandma was a slave. And when you're a slave, you're owned. You don't choose if you're ownedâ¦ She had no rights, she was whipped. That's not a choice, that's by force\n\nwill.i.am\n\n\"I'd line up for free powdered milk and cheese. But then so would everyone else. School gave you breakfast and lunch; all you had to worry about was dinner. And poor people were serving poor people. So you didn't feel inferior.\"\n\nAnd despite the life he enjoys now, with millions in the bank and a Bentley in the garage, he is also very conscious of those roots - and of the poverty of his ancestors before him. He is still angry about comments made by his friend Kanye West concerning slavery and how it may have been a \"choice\".\n\n\"That broke my heart,\" he says, \"My grandma's grandma was a slave. And when you're a slave, you're owned. You don't choose if you're ownedâ¦ She had no rights, she was whipped. That's not a choice, that's by force.\n\n\"I just hope it wasn't said so he can sell a record and some shoes because that would be the worst thing to stir up this very touchy race situation and be the benefactor from it. So I would encourage him to give his shoes away for free, give his album away for free. I don't like going against my community but what he said was harmful. I would never throw my ancestors under the bus for profit.\"\n\nAnd perhaps that's the other great contrast at the heart of will.i.am's infectious, hyperactive personality: on top of everything else he does, he might just see himself as a role model too. And that's why The Voice Kids means so much more to him than the adult version of the show.\n\nAsk him what single piece of advice he'd give to any young person today and he doesn't hesitate: \"People are going to tell you that you can't do this and you can't do that,\" he says. \"There will be people who try to put barriers in front of you. Ignore them.\"\n\nThe will.i.am collection is in Specsavers stores now at Â£125 per pair and included in the two-forone offer. Details: specsavers.co.uk"
