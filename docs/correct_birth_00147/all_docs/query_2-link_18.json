        "text": "General Vital Records FAQs\n\nWhat are the ID requirements for getting a vital record?\n\nA full list of ID requirements and acceptable forms of primary and secondary ID can be found under ID Requirements in the left hand navigation bar.\n\nWhat is your address and contact information?\n\nMailing Address:\n\nOffice of Vital Records\n\nP.O. 1000\n\nRichmond, VA 23218-1000\n\nPhysical Address:\n\nOffice of Vital Records (In-person office hours are 7:00am – 4:30pm M – F) 2001 Maywill Street, Suite 101\n\nRichmond, VA 23230\n\nCall Center:\n\n(804) 662-6200\n\n(Office hours are 8:00am – 4:30pm M – F)\n\nEmail:\n\nPlease select the Contact Us tab at the top of the page and use the E-mail Us section of that page.\n\nWhat is the cost of a vital record?\n\nThe Code of Virginia requires a cost of $12.00 per certificate/search. There is no refund if the certificate is not found. If no record is found for a birth certificate request, a “No Record” letter will be issued. An administration fee of $10.00 is charged for any change to a certificate. If you wish to receive a copy of the certificate once amended, the total cost will be $22.00. This includes the $12.00 certificate fee and the $10.00 administration fee.\n\nMETHOD OF PAYMENT – Online requests can be paid by credit card or mailed in with a check or money order. Make checks or money orders payable to: The State Health Department. Instructions for completing a check or a money order can be found in the appropriate section of the left hand navigation bar. DO NOT SEND CASH through the mail. In person payments can be made by check, money order, all major credit cards, or cash.\n\nAre Birth Cards available?\n\nPlease note: birth cards are no longer issued.\n\nWhat records do you have?\n\nBirths and Deaths: 1853-1896 and June 1912 to present. Birth cards are no longer available.\n\nMarriage Records: 1853 to the present.\n\nDivorce Records: 1918 to the present.\n\nBirth records are public information 100 years after the date of the event; death, marriage, and divorce records, 25 years after the date of the event. Vital Records are available to immediate family members only- mother, father, current spouse, child, brother, sister and grandparents with valid ID. Aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws, etc. cannot obtain a Vital Record.\n\nDue to limited resources, we are unable to conduct genealogy searches in-person. This type of request can be submitted in person and will be processed by the Office of Vital Records. Payment of $12.00 per request is required at the time the request is provided to our office.\n\nContact the Library of Virginia for assistance with requests for information prior to the year 1853 at www.lva.virginia.gov.\n\nAm I entitled to a full certified copy of a death certificate?\n\nOnly immediate family members are entitled to full certified copies of death certificates. However, non-immediate family members can receive a Verification of Death if they have a direct and tangible interest for the certificate. The Verification of Death will show the name of the decedent, date of death, place of death, date of birth and the last four (4) digits of the Social Security Number.\n\nHow long does it take to get a certificate?\n\nFor all birth records requiring no amendments (adoptions, paternity establishment, name changes, etc.), please allow up to 4 weeks.\n\nMarriage and divorce records are available at the Circuit Court in which the event took place. Most records are available at your local DMV or Local Health Department locations.\n\nFor records requiring amendments (adoptions, paternity establishment, name changes, etc.), response time, please allow up to 6 weeks.\n\nDelayed birth registrations will have no delivery time frame due to the process of obtaining documentation to support the facts of birth.\n\nOur peak season is February through September so allow ample time to receive your request.\n\nHow can I get my certificate faster?\n\nThere is an expedited service that you can reach by calling 1-877-572-6333 (press option 2) or going to www.vitalchek.com. You will need a major credit card to use this service. You can also visit your local health department or DMV to get certificates.\n\nDo you have records for other states?\n\nNo, we only have records for events that occurred in Virginia. However, a listing of every state’s Vital Records information can be found on the CDC’s website. Please be advised that we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the fee schedules that are posted for the individual states.\n\nCan you tell me why the certified vital record I received did not have a raised seal?\n\nEffective February 1, 2001, changes were made to the certification paper. The new paper meets the requirements of Virginia law §32.1-272 of the Code of Virginia and 12 VAC 5-550-510 of the Regulations Governing Vital Records. The new certification paper provides a more cost effective and efficient manner to process vital record requests.\n\nBefore issuing the new certification paper to the public, samples of the new certification paper were sent to passport offices across the country as well as other state, federal and local agencies. If you encounter any agency that questions this certification paper, please direct them to this office. Please select the Contact Us tab at the top of the page and use the E-mail Us section to contact Vital Records. Or you can click here and provide them with a copy of this letter.\n\nWhat are the requirements to get a Virginia Marriage License?\n\nCongratulations on your pending nuptials. The Office of Vital Records is the repository and custodian for all birth, death, marriage and divorce records filed in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We issue certified copies of these records and make amendments and/or corrections to birth and death records.\n\nUnfortunately, the Office of Vital Records cannot assist you with what is required to obtain a marriage license since marriage licenses are issued by the city or county circuit courts throughout the Commonwealth. It is suggested that you contact the city or county circuit court where you plan to obtain your marriage license and ask them what their requirements are. The website for a listing of the city and county circuit courts is https://www.vacourts.gov/.\n\nWhat if I can’t meet the ID Requirements?\n\nIf you are unable to supply any of the primary ID documents or two of the secondary ID documents listed on the ID requirements tab, it is suggested that you have an immediate family member request your certificate. A mother, father, adult sibling, grandparent or spouse is entitled to get the certificate. They would need to make the request, and supply a copy of their ID along with the applicable fee with the request.\n\nA legal representative for the registrant who can supply a properly executed Power of Attorney along with their ID, may also be legally able to obtain the certificate on the registrant’s behalf. Examples of this might be the registrant’s lawyer or a funeral director (when applicable). In this case, please submit a contact sheet to OVR for registrants or eligible requesters that cannot meet the identification requirements or have no immediate family members to the request the vital record.\n\nComplex Vital Record FAQs\n\nI need my birth & marriage certificates authenticated. What do I do?\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth is not located in the Office of Vital Records. After receiving your birth and/or marriage certificates, contact the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth at authentication@governor.virginia.gov or www.commonwealth.virginia.gov for more information about getting the proper authentication for your documents.\n\nWhere can I find VS4 forms or other supplies?\n\nAll requests for supplies should be sent to this email address: vitalrec.supplies@vdh.virginia.gov\n\nThe request should include the organization’s name, requester’s name and position, mailing address, daytime contact number, the form you are requesting, and the amount you are requesting.\n\nHow can I find out if I’m still legally married?\n\nIn accordance with the code and regulations governing the issuance of vital records and to ensure the confidentiality of our records and the protection of your privacy, we cannot give out any information listed on a vital record without a written request for a certified copy of the record, proper ID, and the applicable fee for the search of the records. Please submit an application here.\n\nAlternatively, you can start an online application by clicking on the Start Online Application Form button on that page, or select the appropriate PDF application based on the vital event (birth, death, marriage, divorce).\n\nHow much do stillbirth certificates cost?\n\nA law (§ 32.1-258.1.) has passed that removes any cost for ordering a certificate for a stillbirth after July 1, 2022. The gestational period must be 20 weeks or more and the application must be completed and submitted by either parent listed on the fetal death report. The requesting parent may provide a name for the stillborn child on the certificate, but this is not a requirement.\n\nHow can I obtain an Authentication or an Apostille?\n\nAuthentications and Apostilles are handled by the Secretary of the Commonwealth.
