This may be done three ways:\n\nOnline at GoOutdoorsGeorgia.com. Press “Vessel Registration & Renewal,” log into your account, select the boat, and Press “Sold Your Boat?” and follow the steps; OR\n\nCall 1-800-366-2661; OR\n\nIn writing. The signed notification form may be returned to DNR by:\n\nThe email address for documents is: documents@GaBoat.com\n\nThe fax number for documents is: 678-515-9470 (fax)\n\nThe mailing address for documents is:\n\nGeorgia Department of Natural Resources\n\nP.O. Box 934943\n\nAtlanta, GA 31193-4943\n\nBack to Top\n\nDo I need to notify DNR if I change address?\n\nBy law, owners of Georgia registered boats must notify the Department of a change in address from that shown on their boat registration card within 15 days. This notification must be sent to the address below. Or owners may log onto their online account or call the Service Center at 1-800-366-2661 to notify the Department of their change of address.\n\nGeorgia Department of Natural Resources\n\nP.O. Box 934943\n\nAtlanta, GA 31193-4943\n\nBack to Top\n\nDoes a boat using just a trolling motor have to be registered?\n\nYes, any boat with mechanical propulsion must be registered if it is being operated in waters of the State of Georgia. If the boat is used exclusively on private ponds, then it does not need to be registered.\n\nBack to Top\n\nI have a sailboat without a motor. Does it have to be registered?\n\nAll sailboats with mechanical propulsion must be registered regardless of length. Sailboats less than 12 feet in length without mechanical prolusion do not require registration. Sailboats 12 feet or longer must be registered whether or not they have mechanical propulsion. Boats operated exclusively on private ponds or lakes do not have to be registered.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow long does a boat registration last?\n\nVessel registrations extend for a period of three calendar years and expire the last day of the vessel owner's month of birth in the last year of registration.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow long does it take to receive a boat registration?\n\nCustomers will receive their decals and registration card within two weeks of completing registration (full payment and after all required documents are received).\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I obtain a duplicate boat registration (registration card or decals)?\n\nA duplicate registration card with duplicate decals can be requested ONLINE following the procedures for boat registration, by MAIL, or by TELEPHONE at 1-800-366-2661. Duplicate Registration cards and decals are purchased / printed together. The registration cannot be expired. The cost is $1.00 plus an $10.00 service charge if done online, $10.00 service charge by phone, or $10 service change by mail using the boat registration application. If you choose to do this online, go through the screens as if you are registering your boat, and you will get to a choice to purchase a duplicate registration.\n\nBack to Top\n\nI received a letter asking for additional documents. Can I fax or email these documents?\n\nIf you receive a notification stating additional documents are needed to process your boat registration, the documents may be uploaded using your online account, or sent by fax or email. Make sure to send only copies and keep the original for your records until after the registration is complete.\n\nThe email address for documents is:\n\ndocuments@gaboat.com\n\nThe fax number for documents is:\n\n678-515-9470 (fax)\n\nThe mailing address for documents is:\n\nGeorgia Department of Natural Resources\n\nP.O. Box 934943\n\nAtlanta, GA 31193-4943\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I get a refund for my boat registration?\n\nRefund requests are processed by DNR. Only under very limited conditions are fees paid to WRD refundable or reversible. Customers may receive a refund for charges related to electronic system errors or for payment where they do not receive any privilege or other consideration. Download the Refund Request Form.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCan I keep my existing boat registration numbers if they expire?\n\nOnce a boat registration has expired, the numbers may be reassigned. Generally if the boat registration expired within the last calendar year, it is likely that the numbers have not been reassigned. The longer a boat goes unregistered, the more likely it is that the numbers will be reassigned and no longer available for the previous customer’s use.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMy boat is registered in another state. Can I use it in Georgia?\n\nIf a boat is fully registered and valid in another state, the boat may be used in Georgia. However, after 60 days of continuous use in Georgia, the boat must have Georgia registration.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhy does DNR require the use of the owner’s social security number for boat registration?\n\nFederal Coast Guard regulations (CFR Title 33, Section 187.101) require that SSN or individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITIN) be reported for each owner or owners of a vessel, if the person has one of these numbers. If an owner does not have a SSN or ITIN number, other information can be collected and reported.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhy do I have to pay a transaction fee to register my boat?\n\nIn December 2007, DNR first entered into a contract with an outside vendor to design and manage an automated hunting and fishing license and boat registration system. The new license system was required to replace a failing automated licensing system that was not going to be licensed and available to DNR after December 2008. In short, the system was failing and had to be replaced. Absent of a significant funding source to develop and manage a new system “in-house”, DNR explored contractual options for obtaining a “no cost to state” contract like those adopted in many other states. Funding for this type of system would be recovered by the addition of a service charge paid by the buyer at the time of the purchase. The current contract includes: boat registration and renewal online, by telephone, and by mail, and requires mailing registration cards and decals to vessel owners. A Service Center operated by the vendor receives about 200,000 calls per year and registers boat, sells licenses and answers questions about boat registration and recreational hunting and fishing licenses.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMy registration expired and now I’m told the registration numbers on my boat aren’t available and must be changed. Why?\n\nWhen boat registration numbers expire, they become available to be reused. We do this because of the limited quantity of numbers available. While the odds favor that an expired registration number won’t be quickly selected by the computer once it expires, it is available upon expiration and if reassigned is no longer available to the previous registrant. We suggest maintaining boat registrations rather than letting them expire. An expired registration incurs an additional $10 late fee at renewal.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMy out-of-state boat title is held by lien holder; what action, if any, should I take?\n\nIn Georgia, in order for a lien holder to record your outstanding debt against the vessel, the lien holder may record the lien with DNR as part of the Georgia vessel registration. More information on this process appears in these FAQs below. Lien holders are often aware of this procedure, and will take the necessary steps to ensure their lien is secure against a Georgia registered boat.\n\nOnce the lien holder releases the lien against the out-of-state title, they may provide the title to the boat owner. Georgia will accept the original title for registration purposes.\n\nBack to Top\n\nA boat has been left on my property. How do I take control of the boat (abandoned vessel)?\n\nGeorgia’s Abandoned Vessel Code, O.C.G.A 52-7-70 through O.C.G.A. 52-7-77, details the steps required in order to declare a vessel abandoned by the State of Georgia. An Abandoned Vessel Package put together by WRD Law Enforcement Section is a helpful guide that contains required forms and outlines processes that may be used to declare a vessel abandoned under Georgia law.\n\nThe two key forms to initiate the process, the Abandoned Vessel Notice and Information Request directed to both Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Bureau of Investigation can be found in the Abandoned Vessel Package. These must be completed with as much information as is known and submitted to the Agency and addresses noted at the top of each form.\n\nIf the vessel was abandoned at a storage facility and you have a copy of a contract with the individual that stored the vessel indicating that the vessel was \"Specified collateral\" and the individual defaulted on that contract, then all you have to do is complete the Default of Security Interest/Transfer Statement to transfer the vessel into your name. It will not be necessary to go through the \"Abandoned Vessel\" process whenever self-storage facilities contract with individuals and the property stored is \"Specified Collateral\" and the customer defaults on that security interest.\n\nThe Abandoned Vessel process ends with a judge assigning ownership. It can be a complicated process. If there are no liens or security interests on the vessel, if the owner of record as confirmed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources will sign a bill of sale to the claimant there is no need to initiate the Abandoned Vessel process. The bill of sale will be sufficient for the claimant to register the vessel in their name.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhy did you cash my check for boat registration before sending my registration decals?\n\nOur mail-in boat registration procedures were established to meet our fiduciary responsibility to both the State of Georgia and to our customers. The first objective for mail-in payments is to ensure that customer’s fees are processed and recorded in such a manner to prevent mishandling of payments, in part accomplished by keeping the number of individuals handling your payment to the lowest level possible. The P.O. Box that receives your boat registration application and payment are physically located at a bank processing center used by the State of Georgia so that your payment is deposited immediately upon receipt. A scanned image of your check or money order is generated as a reference, and your boat registration application is sent from the bank to our license vendor for processing and fulfillment. If the application is complete and all necessary documents are present, the application is typically processed within 48 hours. Decals are created each night and mailed 5 days a week. It typically takes about two weeks from the time we receive your application at the P.O. Box until you receive your decals, or receive a letter or email stating that the application is not complete or documents are missing.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I contact my boat manufacturer to get a hull identification number (HIN)?\n\nA HIN is required for boats manufactured after November 1, 1972. If the HIN is unavailable and unknown, the boat owner must first contact the boat manufacturer to obtain a replacement HIN. The U.S. Coast Guard maintains a list of boat manufacturers and contact information at http://uscgboating.org/content/manufacturers-identification.php.\n\nIf the manufacturer is out of business or will not assist the boat owner, a DNR HIN Inspection is necessary. DNR will assign a HIN number during the inspection process and the boat owner is responsible for permanently affixing the HIN to the boat.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHull Identification Number Inspection\n\nA Hull Identification Number (HIN) Inspection is necessary when boat owners do not have a Hull Identification Number from the Manufacturer on any vessel built after 1972. HIN Inspections are also required for any Homemade vessel. HIN Inspections are handled through the Law Enforcement Division.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I permanently affix my hull identification number (HIN) to my boat?\n\nA HIN is required for recreational boats manufactured after November 1, 1972. If the HIN is assigned by DNR, or if the HIN is known but the plate is missing or the HIN not inscribed on the boat, the boat owner is responsible for permanently affixing the HIN to the boat.\n\nEach hull identification number must be carved, burned, stamped, embossed, molded, bonded, or otherwise permanently affixed to the boat so that alteration, removal, or replacement would be obvious. If the number is on a separate plate, the plate must be fastened in such a manner that its removal would normally cause some scarring of or damage to the surrounding hull area. A hull identification number must not be attached to parts of the boat that are removable. The characters of each hull identification number must be no less than one-fourth of an inch high.\n\nTwo identical hull identification numbers are required to be displayed on each boat hull.\n\nPrimary Location. If the hull identification number would not be visible, because of rails, fittings, or other accessories, the number must be affixed as near as possible to the location specified below.\n\nOn boats with transoms, to the starboard outboard side of the transom within two inches of the top of the transom, gunwale, or hull/deck joint, whichever is lowest.\n\nOn boats without transoms or on boats on which it would be impractical to use the transom, to the starboard outboard side of the hull, aft, within one foot of the stern and within two inches of the top of the hull side, gunwale or hull/deck joint, whichever is lowest.\n\nOn catamarans and pontoon boats which have readily replaceable hulls, to the aft crossbeam within one foot of the starboard hull attachment.\n\nDuplicate Location. The hull identification number must be affixed in an unexposed location on the interior of the boat or beneath a fitting or item of hardware.\n\nO.C.G.A. § 52-7-7.1. Hull identification numbers required; penalty for violations\n\n(a) No person shall operate on the waters of this state a vessel manufactured after November 1, 1972, unless the vessel displays an assigned hull identification number as required by the United States Coast Guard or by the issuing authority, except any of those vessels exempted by Code Section 52-7-7.6. The hull identification number shall be carved, burned, stamped, embossed, or otherwise permanently affixed to the outboard side of the transom or the starboard side within two feet of the transom above the waterline in accordance with federal law or as directed by the issuing authority.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDoes Georgia register or title outboard motors?\n\nThe State of Georgia records outboard motors over 24 hp during the registration process and these are part of the eTitle. The National Vessel Numbering & Titling Manual, Third Edition, published by the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators in 2011 gives information on each state’s vessel numbering and titling practices including which states title and/or register outboard motors.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I register my boat trailer?\n\nAll boat trailers must be registered with the Georgia Motor Vehicle Division. Registration is done through your local County Tax Commissioners Office (Tag Office). Tax Office locations: https://mvd.dor.ga.gov/motor/tagoffices/SelectTagOffice.aspx.\n\nBack to Top\n\nI built a homemade boat. How do I register it?\n\nHomemade boats must be assigned a hull identification number (HIN). To get a HIN, persons should initiate the boat registration process and pay for registration using the normal process (online, mail or phone) so that a record of the boat is in our system. Only the person either building the boat or furnishing materials under a contract for another to build a boat may apply for a HIN and register a homemade boat. Such boat may not be sold to any person. Persons who wish to build boats and sell them may obtain a Manufacturer's Identification Code (MIC) from the U.S. Coast Guard for the purpose of building boats for sale. There are safety and other standards that must be met..\n\nHIN Inspections are conducted through the DNR Law Enforcement Division at the boat location. List of game warden offices by county.\n\nInspections will not be performed if customers have not paid for a registration in advance of the inspection. Boat owners should bring receipts for materials used to construct the homemade boat if done themselves or bring the contract they used to provide materials and have another person build the boat, and should bring any other documents and correspondence that relate to the boat, boat construction, or registration process that may be helpful during the HIN Inspection to support registration.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDo I have to keep my boat registered?\n\nThere is no requirement that the boat remain registered. It may not be used on state waters without a current registration in the owner's name. However, there is a possibility that the registration number on the boat may be reassigned if the registration is allowed to lapse. Registrations allowed to lapse will incur a $10 late fee at renewal.\n\nBack to Top\n\nI am absolutely unable to get proof of ownership documents to support my Georgia boat registration. What are my options?\n\nBoat owners should use every effort to obtain the required supporting documents for boat registration to avoid costs to themselves and the state. If all options have been exhausted, an Affidavit of Vessel Ownership may be provided by the applicant. Completing the affidavit requires procedures and documents to show attempted contact with the owner of record for the vessel, and depending on the value of the vessel, may require a bond. If required, the affidavit process should be initiated immediately upon vessel registration.\n\nBack to Top\n\nInformation for persons holding a security interest, and for lien holders, lenders and others regarding original titles and original Manufacturers Statement of Origin (MSO)/Uniform Commercial Code Georgia\n\nGeorgia is a eTitle state for vessels. Once the registration is finalized, registered vessels have a Georgia eTitle in the vessel registration system. Outboard motors over 25 hp are included on the title. There are two methods for recording a security interest or lien in a Georgia registered vessel.\n\nA lender may use the Security Interest or Lien form to record (perfect) a security interest in a Georgia registered vessel. The cost to record the lien is $10. The lien will be recorded on the electronic record (eTitle) in the Georgia vessel registration system. The lienholder will receive a Boat Registration and Verification Record to show the lien was filed on the eTitle. A paper copy of the title showing the lien may be requested by the lienholder for an additional $10. When the lien is satisfied the lienholder will send the Security Interest or Lien form to release the lien, or if a paper title was purchased the lien is released by returning the paper title. The vessel returns to an eTitle in the vessel owner’s name(s). Address and directions for releasing the lien appear on the form and on the title.\n\nA lender with a security interest may record outstanding debt against a vessel and an individual by filing a Georgia UCC-1 form through the Georgia Superior Court Clerk’s Cooperative Authority. Refer to the following site for information and a checklist: http://www.gsccca.org/learn/projects-programs/ucc-system\n\nA direct link to UCC forms is:\n\nhttps://www.gsccca.org/filesandforms/uccforms.asp\n\nIf needed, anyone may request a free Boat Registration and Verification Record at this link:\n\nhttps://api.gooutdoorsgeorgia.com/exports/DataRequest.aspx\n\nThis process is done at the Georgia county level through the resident's county Clerk of Superior Court. The original manufacturer's statement of origin (MSO) or vessel title (if coming from another state) is not needed for the UCC process. After filing a Georgia UCC-1 form, the lender may give the original MSO or original title to the vessel owner.\n\nIt is not possible to attach existing GA UCC records to boat registrations in the DNR registration system. But the GA UCC process is still in place and remains binding on past filings. (It remains a legal process for placing a security interest on a vessel). Dealers may decide to place new liens in the GA DNR system and let the old GA UCC liens remain in that system.\n\nApplicable to current UCC lien boats: at three year renewal of registration, a boat owner must answer under penalty of law if there is a lien is on the vessel. There is no e-Title on the vessel until they answer that question (and a question on hull damage and about the outboard motor, if one exists). If they answer yes regarding the lien and answer the additional questions. an E-title is issued with a note there is self-reported lien on the vessel, and the owner is blocked from obtaining a paper title. The lienholder may decide to perfect the lien ($10) in the DNR system, or not. If perfected the lienholder is sent Boat Registration and Verification Record or may obtain a paper title for $10.\n\nBack to Top\n\nInformation for boat dealers registering customer's boats\n\nSome boat dealers help customers register their boat, and some dealers may also be involved in helping the lienholder obtain security records or lienholder documents. The following information may help.\n\nBoat Registration\n\nIf dealers are helping the customer with their boat registration, they may do so by mail application, online, or by phone.\n\nIf mail, the dealer should submit:\n\nthe paper registration application signed by the boat owner(s)\n\nthe bill of sale from dealer to new owner,\n\nthe original transferred MSO from dealer to owner if a new boat (keep a copy),\n\nthe bill of sale from the previous owner of record to the dealer if a used boat,\n\ncheck or money order to the Department of Natural Resources.\n\nIf online, the transaction must be done in the primary boat owner’s GoOutdoorsGeorgia DNR account, and the boat owner must certify that all information is correct.\n\nBoat information will be completed online,\n\nPayment is by credit card,\n\nAfter payment, upload the bill of sale from dealer to new owner, the transferred MSO from dealer to owner if a new boat, and the bill of sale from the previous owner of record to the dealer if a used boat.\n\nIf the owner is not present to certify all information is correct, from the account, print a pre-filled registration form and have the owner sign and upload that signed form to the account. Or the owner can log into their account and certify that the information is correct.\n\nIf a brand new boat, after the registration is complete and boat registration card is received by mail, the original transferred MSO must be destroyed by the boat owner or dealer. It is no longer the controlling document and can cause confusion if the original remains in existence. It is okay to keep a copy.\n\nIf by telephone:\n\nBoat information will be completed with the Service Desk agent,\n\nPayment is by credit card,\n\nLog into the customer account and upload: the bill of sale from dealer to new owner, the transferred MSO from dealer to owner if a new boat, and the bill of sale from the previous owner of record to the dealer if a used boat.\n\nFrom the account print a pre-filled registration form and have the owner sign and upload that signed form to the account. The Service Desk may instead email a pre-filled registration form for the owner to sign, and upload that, or the owner can log into their account and certify the information is correct.\n\nIf a brand new boat, after the registration is complete and boat registration card received by mail, the original transferred MSO must be destroyed by the boat owner or dealer. It is no longer the controlling document and can cause confusion if the original remains in existence. It is okay to keep a copy.\n\nAfter payment, owners receive a temporary (60 day) authorization number that allows use of the boat in Georgia waters until the decals and registration card arrive.\n\nBoat Dealers Assisting Lienholders\n\nIf you register the boat for the owner, the lienholder may wish to perfect the lien. The dealer must have the lienholder complete and sign the Security Interest or Lien Form, attach supporting documentation of lien, and submit the form plus $10 to perfect the title. The dealer may complete the form if they are an authorized representative for the lienholder. Full procedures are written on the Security Interest or Lien Form. The lienholder will receive a Boat Registration and Verification Record that indicates the lien has been perfected and that there is an eTitle in our system indicating the lien. The lienholder or their representative may indicate on the form they wish to obtain a paper title, and may do so for an additional $10 ($20 total).\n\nFYI: The owner of a vessel with a lien may not request or receive a paper copy of the title.\n\nIf needed, anyone may request a free BOAT REGISTRATION AND VERIFICATION RECORD at this link:\n\nhttps://api.gooutdoorsgeorgia.com/exports/DataRequest.aspx\n\nBack to Top\n\nPower of Attorney\n\nDealers may wish to have sellers of boats to give them Power of Attorney for the boat. This will allow the dealer to request a paper title for the boat or take other actions as needed. Dealers may use their own form or may use this form for that purpose.\n\nDo I register my US Coast Guard documented vessel?\n\nFor boats where Georgia is the state of primary use, documentation by the U.S. Coast Guard does not exempt the State of Georgia vessel registration requirement. Documentation by the U.S. Coast Guard only removes the requirement that the state registration numbers must be displayed on the vessel. You are still required to display the valid Georgia registration decal."
