        "text": "What are the early signs of labour?\n\nThe early signs of labour are the physical changes in your hormones and body as it gets ready for the birth. These might include:\n\ncramps that feel like period pain\n\nlow backache\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nchange in vaginal discharge\n\nbloodstained discharge (‘A show’)\n\nwaters breaking\n\nYou cannot know exactly when your labour will start, since it varies for each pregnancy. Recognising early signs as different from your normal pregnancy discomforts can help you identify when labour is about to begin. You may also notice:\n\nYour baby drops deeper into your pelvis, increasing pressure on your bladder and the need to urinate more often.\n\nYou have a sudden burst of energy and the urge to prepare for the baby, known as “nesting”.\n\nWhat is 'a show'?\n\n'A show' is bloodstained or pink-coloured discharge that you might find on your underwear close to labour starting. It is a thick plug of mucus that seals the cervix to protect your baby from infection during your pregnancy.\n\nA ‘show’ means your cervix is beginning to open. It can happen days or even weeks before your contractions start. It can look like jelly, be watery or sticky and come away in one piece or in several pieces over a few days. Not everyone has or notices a ‘show’.\n\nWhen will I notice early signs of labour?\n\nEarly signs of labour usually begin between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy. You may notice your baby’s head engaging (‘dropping’) in the pelvis at about 36 weeks, especially if this is your first baby.\n\nLabour varies and can start differently for different people. The first stage of labour, from when your cervix starts to soften until your baby is born, can last for hours or days. You might not feel anything at first, and experience more discomfort as the contractions become strong and regular.\n\nHow do I know I am in labour?\n\nYou are in labour when your contractions become regular, longer and stronger. These contractions start to thin (efface) and open (dilate) the cervix. These are different to Braxton Hicks contractions, which help your body prepare for labour, but do not open the cervix.\n\nIf this is your first labour, the first stage of labour usually lasts between 8 to 12 hours. It is best to stay home during early labour, where you are free to move around and do what feels right for you.\n\nHead to hospital or where you plan to give birth when contractions are 5 minutes apart or as advised by your midwife or doctor. You should time your contractions from the start of one contraction to the start of the next.\n\nWhat are the signs that something is wrong?\n\nThere are signs that are concerning or can show that you baby might be in distress. Call your midwife, doctor or hospital straight away if:\n\nyour waters break, and the fluid is green or brown, indicating that your baby has passed meconium (poo) and may be distressed\n\nyou experience bleeding from your vagina\n\nyou experience contractions or signs of labour before 37 weeks, as you may be at risk of premature labour\n\nyou are concerned about your baby’s movements\n\nyou have a feeling of strong pressure in your vagina or bottom or an urge to push\n\nResources and support"
