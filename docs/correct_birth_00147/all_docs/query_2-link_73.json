        "text": "German citizenship is attained at birth if at least one parent is German. If you are not married and only the father is a German national, the child only attains German citizenship if the father effectively recognizes his paternity according to German law.\n\nGerman nationals born abroad on or after 1 January 2000 should note that any children of theirs born outside Germany will acquire German nationality only if the parents report the birth to the competent German mission abroad before the child's first birthday.\n\nInformation on applying for a passport and, where applicable, on acknowledgement of paternity is available at the German mission covering your place of residence.\n\nGerman missions abroad: Countries A to Z\n\nProvided certain other conditions are met you have the right to naturalization after you have been legally resident in the Federal Republic of Germany for three years. However you have to have been married for at least two years.\n\nFor further advice and information, please contact the competent local German authority.\n\nYes. A child born in Germany (on or after 1 January 2000) can acquire German nationality, even if neither of the parents is German. The only precondition is that one of the parents has been legally and habitually resident in Germany for eight years and has a permanent right of residence. The child must however decide at some stage between the age of 18 and 23 whether to retain his/her German nationality or another nationality acquired by birth.\n\nFor further advice, please contact the competent authorities at your place of residence.\n\nA child can attain German citizenship by being born in Germany even if neither parent is German. However this only applies to children born on or after 1 January 2000.\n\nA further condition is that one parent has been legally resident in Germany for eight years and has a right of unlimited residence or for three years an unlimited residence permit. Children who become German citizens in this way must however decide between the age of 18 and 23 whether they want to retain German citizenship or the citizenship of their parents.\n\nYes, in principle this is possible. Mastery of the German language and proof of ties to Germany are just as important as the prognosis that the applicant for citizenship will not require state funds for maintenance if he/she moves to Germany. There are a number of other conditions.\n\nYou are advised to contact the competent German mission abroad to avoid submitting an application that cannot be accepted but which is nevertheless subject to a fee.\n\nGerman missions abroad: Countries A to Z\n\nA German national who applies for and receives a foreign nationality (except the nationality of one of the EU Member States or Switzerland) loses his/her German nationality. The only way of preventing the loss of German citizenship is if the applicant obtained permission to retain the nationality by the German authorities prior to acquiring the foreign nationality.\n\nGerman nationals required to perform military service who voluntarily enter the forces or comparable armed groups of a country of which they are also a national without the consent of the district draft board lose their German nationality automatically.\n\nFor further advice, please contact the competent German mission covering your place of residence.\n\nGerman missions abroad: Countries A to Z\n\nIn principle it is possible for former Germans to be renaturalized. Key conditions include the ability to support oneself, mastery of the German language and proof of ties to Germany. Generally health insurance for Germany is also required. Chances are very much increased by a readiness to relinquish all previous nationalities.\n\nIf the applicant is not prepared to do so, he/she has to outline in detail the reasons for not relinquishing his/her current nationality in line with the retention permit.\n\nSuch a naturalization does not automatically include children, grandchildren and other descendants. Separate applications have to be submitted and the above criteria apply.\n\nFor further advice, please contact the competent German mission covering your place of residence.\n\nGerman missions abroad: Countries A to Z\n\nYes, victims of National Socialist denationalization measures and their descendants have the right to be renationalized in line with Article 116 (2) of the Basic Law even if this means multiple nationality. There is no need to prove knowledge of the German language. Nevertheless it is examined whether the German nationality of the ancestor could have been lost for reasons unrelated to National Socialism. Were this the case, the descendants would have no right to German citizenship.\n\nFor further advice, please contact the competent German mission covering your place of residence.\n\nGerman missions abroad: Countries A to Z"
