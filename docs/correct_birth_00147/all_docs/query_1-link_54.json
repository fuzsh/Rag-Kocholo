The City and County of Honolulu offers REAL ID-federal compliant driver licenses and state ID cards marked with a star in a gold circle.\n\nAll Hawaii issued driver licenses and ID cards, with or without the star in a gold circle, are fully compliant with federal requirements until May 7, 2025. There is no rush to acquire a Real ID if your current Real ID is not nearing expiration.\n\nWhen it’s time for you to renew your state ID you will need to download and complete a state of Hawaii Application.\n\nIf you have not already done so, you will need to submit original documents for proof of legal residence, social security number, and two documents to show Hawaii residency. For assistance with identifying acceptable supporting documents required to obtain a driver’s license, please consult our interactive Documents Guide or download this document.\n\n(Note: Effective June 18, 2021, presenting Social Security Number (SSN) documentation is optional.)\n\nBy law, an individual cannot hold a REAL ID-compliant state ID card and REAL ID-compliant driver’s license. You may hold only one REAL ID-compliant card.\n\nApply for a duplicate license at any City and County of Honolulu Driver Licensing Center and pay the $6.00 duplicate license fee. Bring your current valid driver’s license and a completed driver’s license application indicating you wish to designate your driver’s license as your REAL ID-compliant card.
