        "text": "All individuals applying for a permit, license, or identification card must show proof of identity, date of birth, and legal presence in the United States by presenting one of the documents listed below.\n\nU.S. Birth Certificate (state certified; government issued)\n\nU.S. Territory Birth Certificate\n\nValid, unexpired U.S. Passport or U.S Passport Card\n\nReport of Birth Abroad issued by the U.S. Department of State\n\nCertificate of Naturalization\n\nCertificate of Citizenship\n\nValid, unexpired Permanent Resident Card\n\nValid, unexpired Employment Authorization Card\n\nValid, unexpired Foreign Passport with I-94\n\nI-94 Card stamped Refugee or Asylee\n\nNote: No photocopies or hospital certificates will be accepted. All documents must be original or certified copies only.\n\nIndividuals born in North Dakota may obtain a copy of their certified birth certificate by contacting Vital Records at the North Dakota Department of Health.\n\nIndividuals born in another state may access vital record offices through https://www.vitalrec.com or https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm.\n\nProvide proof of North Dakota residence address by presenting two documents from the list below. In the event you are unable to provide the required documents, please contact 855-633-6835 for guidance on potential alternatives.\n\nMost current government-issued property tax statement\n\nCurrent mortgage/lease/rental document\n\nCurrent homeowner's/renter's insurance policy\n\nCurrent utility bill (electricity, gas, water, sewer, cable, recycle)\n\nSchool/College Transcript issued within 6 months\n\nCurrent financial statement (issued by financial institution, government entity, government-regulated entity)\n\nCurrent pay stub or statement from employer\n\nCurrent vehicle insurance policy/statement\n\nCurrent resident certificate or Tribal ID issued by a North Dakota Tribe with North Dakota resident address\n\nCurrent formal resident statement issued by property owner/renter\n\nRelief Agency or Shelter Certification\n\nParent's proof of address for minor child (under 18)\n\nNote: All documents must contain your name and current physical residence address. Post Office Boxes are not acceptable proof of residence address. No photocopies; all documents must be original or certified copies only.\n\nUnlike a passport, REAL ID information is scanned and retained in the state driver license system. It is state data, so it is kept in-state only. The federal REAL ID Act of 2005 has no requirement for this data to be shared with anyone. We do not share personal private information except as provided in NDCC 39-33.\n\nThe bill approved by the legislature in 2017 makes these documents \"not part of the public record,\" so the security of the data is enhanced and unobtainable for non-official purposes.\n\nThe Opt-In/Opt-Out feature gives you a choice about whether you want to get a REAL ID driver license or not. If you choose to Opt-In, you will be able to use your driver license as a form of identification to complete domestic airline travel and access federal facilities.\n\nThe Opt-Out feature also lets you choose to Opt-Out of the REAL ID process and not obtain a REAL ID driver license. This means you will see no change in how you currently renew your driver license, and you will not receive a REAL ID driver license. Some people may choose to Opt-Out because they plan to use their passport for identification when traveling, or they don't plan to travel on domestic airlines or access federal facilities.\n\nREAL ID does not create a federal database or federally controlled or issued identification document. This is accomplished by the U.S. Passport. REAL ID does not replace a passport used for international travel, such as visiting Canada or other countries. Lastly, REAL ID does not include an RFID chip inside. The Enhanced Driver License (EDL) does have a chip that provides information to a federal database."
