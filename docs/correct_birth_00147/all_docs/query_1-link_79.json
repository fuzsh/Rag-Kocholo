        "text": "As soon as you establish residency in Missouri, you must apply and pay for a Missouri driver license at a Missouri license office. You may surrender a valid current driver license (or one that is expired 184 days or less) from another U.S. state to the state of Missouri to waive your Missouri skills and written tests. All applicants are required to pass the Missouri road sign recognition and vision tests.\n\nCommercial Driver License (CDL) holders must transfer their CDL within 30 days of transfer of residency.\n\nPlease click here for a complete list of documents required to obtain a Missouri driver or nondriver license or instruction permit.\n\nIf you are between the ages of 21 and 69, you may apply for a 6-year Missouri driver license. If you are between the ages of 18 and 20, or you are 70 or over, you may apply for a 3-year Missouri driver license. A fee chart is included in Chapter 1 of the Missouri Driver Guide.\n\nPlease click here if you want more information about getting a HazMat endorsement on a Missouri CDL.\n\nIf you want to update the actual driver license card that you carry in your wallet, you must apply and pay for an updated license at a Missouri license office. If you are within six months of the expiration date on your driver license, you may apply for an early renewal. If not, the transaction would be processed as a duplicate with the same expiration date as your current driver license.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you choose to update your actual driver license, you may click here for the information you will need to update your address in our files.\n\nClick here for a complete list of documents required to obtain a Missouri driver license, nondriver license, or instruction permit.\n\nTo change your name, you must take documents to verify your identity, Social Security number, Missouri residency, and proof of your name change to a Missouri license office. You may then apply and pay for a duplicate driver license with your new name. Since a new signature must be \"captured\", a new photo may be necessary as well. If your Missouri driver license is within 6 months (184 days) of expiring, you are eligible to renew your driver license early, saving you another trip to the license office.\n\nAcceptable documents to verify a name change include:\n\nCertified Marriage Certificate\n\nCertified Divorce Decree\n\nCertified Court Order\n\nCertified Adoption Papers\n\nAmended Birth Certificate\n\nIf you are applying for an initial REAL ID-compliant card at the time of completing your name change request, additional documents may be required. Please click here for a complete list of documents required to obtain a REAL ID-compliant Missouri driver license, nondriver license, or instruction permit.\n\nYou must first go to a Missouri State Highway Patrol examination station to take the written, vision and road sign recognition tests. You must then take your Driver Examination Record to a Missouri license office to apply and pay for your instruction permit. Your parent or legal guardian* must come with you to the license office.\n\n* If the applicant is enrolled in a federal residential job training program, then a certified driver training instructor employed by that program may also fulfill the Graduated Driver License Law responsibilities of the parent, grandparent, or legal guardian.\n\nLicensing for a moped or motor scooter depends on whether the vehicle meets the definition of a motorized bicycle. The Missouri statute definition of a motorized bicycle is as follows:\n\n\"Any two-wheeled or three-wheeled device having an automatic transmission and a motor with a cylinder capacity of not more than fifty (50) cubic centimeters, which produces less than three (3) gross brake horsepower, and is capable of propelling the device at a maximum speed of not more than thirty (30) miles per hour on level ground.\"\n\nA motorized bicycle does not have to be registered with the Missouri Department of Revenue. However, you must have a valid driver license to operate a motorized bicycle on public streets (though no motorcycle endorsement is required).\n\nMissouri statute does not require a helmet to be worn when operating a motorized bicycle. Please contact your local law enforcement agencies for any county/municipal codes that deal with helmets and motorized bicycles.\n\nKeep in mind that no motorized bicycle may be operated on any public thoroughfare located within this state that has been designated as part of the federal interstate highway system.\n\nYou may apply and pay for a replacement driver license at any Missouri license office.\n\nYou may obtain a duplicate license or instruction permit if your current document is not due to expire within six months (184 days) from the current date (exceptions may apply for certain document types or classifications) and you meet one of these conditions:\n\nYour Missouri driver license, permit, or nondriver license has been lost, stolen, or destroyed;\n\nYour name, date of birth, gender, or residence address has changed;\n\nYou want to obtain a REAL ID-compliant card; or\n\nYou wish to add the Permanent Disability, Boater Identification, or Veteran Designation Symbol to a current driver or nondriver license.\n\nAcceptable documents for proof of identity and Missouri residency are required. You must also present a document verifying mailing address, if different from residence address. Click here for a list of acceptable documents.\n\nAdditional documents may be required to:\n\nVerify lawful status and Social Security number when applying for a duplicate to obtain an initial REAL ID-compliant card;\n\nVerify eligibility for special indicators, such as boater safety, Veteran, or permanent disability; or\n\nVerify a name change, date of birth change, or gender changes.\n\nDuplicate licensing fees are required. More information regarding fees can be found in the Missouri Driver Guide.\n\nIf your current document is not due to expire within six months, or 184 days, from the current date, you may request an early renewal. If your driver license or nondriver license is due to expire within the next six months, your transaction would be processed as a renewal. You may be required to present acceptable documents for proof of identity, lawful status, Social Security number, and Missouri residency.\n\nNOTE: If your driver license, nondriver license, permit, or any personal documents verifying your identity have been stolen or you suspect fraudulent use of your license number, our department recommends you notify your local law enforcement agency.\n\nYou may request a new number to be assigned by presenting a police report detailing such occurrence, proof of identity, and other required verification documents to apply for a duplicate or renewal license. Be advised, any prior number issued will be retained on your record for cross reference purposes. If you have more than one current document type on file, such as a license and nondriver license, you will be required to update all documents to the new number and pay applicable fees.\n\nIt is estimated that drowsy driving is a factor in nearly one in six fatal crashes. One study shows that two out of five drivers surveyed (41 percent) admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel at some point. Another study showed there was no difference between driving sleepy or drunk; both doubled the risk of causing an accident.\n\nFor more information on the dangers of drowsy driving, and the steps you can take to prevent it, you may wish to visit the following link, found on the National Sleep Foundation's website."
