        "text": "Student Health Insurance & Immunizations\n\nImportant Information\n\nUniversity Health Services is here to assist you with the Immunization and Health Insurance requirements for Florida State University students.\n\nIn order to register for classes at FSU, all students are required to submit a one-time Immunization form, showing proof of two combined MMR vaccines and to either show proof of or complete a waiver for Hepatitis B and Meningococcal Meningitis. For complete details, select the Immunization Requirements icon at the bottom of this page to access the form and Instructions for completion.\n\nAdditionally, on an annual basis FSU requires all domestic full time, main campus students and all International students with F or J visa types to show proof of health insurance coverage. For complete details, instructions for showing proof, or, if you do not have sufficient coverage already, and wish to see details for the FSU sponsored plan through United Healthcare Student Resources, select one of the options below or the Insurance Requirement page to get started.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you're uncertain about whether your insurance will cover services at UHS, contact your insurance provider. Let them know that your student is residing in Tallahassee, FL and ask about your coverage status.\n\nFall 2024 Information\n\nDon't miss your chance during the open waiver/enrollment window to avoid automatic enrollment in the student health insurance plan, ensuring you have the coverage you need and the flexibility to choose the best options for your healthcare.\n\nLearn More\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nImmunization FAQs\n\nWhat immunizations are required?\n\nMMR (measles, mumps, rubella)\n\nTwo vaccinations are required.\n\nThe first immunization must have been given on or after the first birthday and after January 1, 1968. Immunizations given more than 4 days before the first birthday DO NOT count toward the two MMR requirement.\n\nThe second immunization must have been given at least 28 days following the first MMR immunization.\n\nIgG titers showing proof of positive immunity to measles, mumps AND rubella may be submitted in place of the two MMR requirement.\n\nLab slips showing POSITIVE immunity to each of the three diseases must be submitted with the Student Immunization Record.\n\nAn equivocal or negative titer on any of the three tests will require the student to receive the MMR series.\n\nStudents born before January 1, 1957 are exempt from showing proof of vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella.\n\nIs the Meningitis vaccine recommended, safe and available at UHS?\n\nThe meningitis vaccine is recommended by the health center for those students who will be living in residence halls or living in close quarters (Greek housing, apartment complexes, etc.). It is safe to receive and we do have the vaccine at the health center. Call 850-644-4567 to schedule an appointment.\n\nCan UHS complete my Hepatitis B series?\n\nYes, if you need immunizations, required or not, you may get them at UHS by calling 850-644-4567 to schedule an appointment.\n\nI have a medical condition that prevents me from receiving the MMR. What do I do?\n\nAttach a letter from your medical provider to your Immunization Form explaining why you cannot receive the MMR. Make certain the letter includes whether the exemption is permanent or temporary. If the exemption is temporary (such as your course of medication will end or your baby will be born) have the letter include an end date for the exemption. Understand further that if there is an immunization-preventable disease outbreak at FSU, any student with an exemption for immunizations will be excluded from classes and any other activities on campus until two weeks after the last case has been diagnosed.\n\nWhat do I do if I can't find any of my immunization records?\n\nIf you cannot find proof of your immunization records, you have the option to retake the dose series for the required MMR vaccine or receive a blood draw for MMR IgG titers to show proof of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. You must show positive for all three titers and submit numerical lab results to the Health Compliance office. You may also receive the shots for Hepatitis B and Meningitis or decline the vaccines by completing the waivers on the Immunization form. There is a titer for Hepatitis B, but there is no titer for Meningitis at this time.\n\nTips for locating vaccination records\n\nhttp://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/immunization/Locating-Vaccination-Records/index.html\n\nImmunization records that exist for adults are usually records that were provided to their parents when they received vaccines as children and in the adult's medical record of the physician or clinic where vaccines were given. There is no national database that maintains the immunization records for adults. If official copies of immunization records are needed or if there is a desire to update personal records, the following places may provide some assistance to obtaining these records:\n\nRequest immunization records from parents or caregivers if they still have them.\n\nSearch baby books or other saved documents from childhood\n\nContact the high school and/or college health services attended for dates of any immunizations received. Please be advised that records are only maintained for a certain length of time.\n\nContact previous employers (including the military) that may have required immunizations for employment purposes.\n\nContact your health care provider or county health department. Please be advised that records are maintained by the health care provider’s office for a limited number of years.\n\nCheck with the county health department to determine if you have immunizations recorded in the Florida SHOTS™ system.\n\nIf Unable to Locate Immunization Records\n\nAfter taking the actions above and you are still unsuccessful the location of the immunization records, your health care provider may be able to perform blood tests (titer testing) to determine if you have immunity to some vaccine-preventable diseases. You may need to receive some vaccines again, which is safe.\n\nContact the Immunization Section\n\n1-877-888-7468\n\nimmunization@FLHealth.gov\n\nFax: 850-922-4195\n\nMailing address: Florida Department of Health/Immunization Section- 4052 Bald Cypress Way, Bin A11, Tallahassee, FL 32399-1719d\n\nWhat if my doctor's office doesn't have an office stamp?\n\nIf your doctor's office does not have an office stamp, they may attach their business card, a fax coversheet with their letterhead, or neatly fill in their office information in the office stamp section of the form.\n\nWhat is Noles File Transfer (NiFTy)?\n\nNoles File Transfer is a secure and easy way for you to move files in and out of the university. All files are transferred across the network securely encrypted.\n\nHow do I submit records via the Noles File Transfer?\n\nIf you are an FSU user, you will need to select \"Login\" and follow the directions provided on https://nifty.fsu.edu/ to submit the required documents to Health Compliance.\n\nIf you are not an FSU user, you will select \"Drop-off\" and follow the directions provided on https://nifty.fsu.edu/.\n\nOnce I submit my immunization information, when will my hold be lifted?\n\nPlease allow 3-5 business days for your immunization records to be reviewed and processed by the Health Center staff.\n\nInsurance FAQs\n\nHow often do I need to update my health insurance information?\n\nStudents must update their health insurance information annually or if their current policy expires (ex: purchased spring/summer plan only and you plan to enroll in fall classes). FSU students must show evidence of a health insurance prior to enrolling for a future semester.\n\nIf you have a Student Health Insurance hold, the information we have on file for you is outdated or your current policy has expired, click here to enter your current policy information or sign up for the FSU sponsored health insurance plan for students.\n\nWhat is a premium? When are payments due?\n\nPayments you make to your insurance provider to keep your coverage. Payments are due about 15 days after the start of the plan.\n\nMany students receive their financial aid disbursement before the premium payment due date. If you are planning to use your financial aid to pay for the plan, no additional action is required by you.\n\nIf you are purchasing the annual plan through FSU, the premium is split evenly between your fall and spring terms. The premium will be placed on your Student Central Account. View your account at https://my.fsu.edu.\n\nHow do I cancel my student health plan?\n\nCancellation requests of the Student Health Plan must be received in writing. Log in to: https://insuranceadjustments.uhs.fsu.edu/ to make a request to cancel or adjust your current plan.\n\nPer the Student Health Insurance Policy, there only two conditions in which a policy may be cancelled after the policy start date. Cancellations are allowed if you:\n\nLeave FSU to join the military\n\nWithdraw before you have attended classes for 31 calendar days of the term for which you purchased coverage. It is the student's responsibility to notify the compliance office of withdrawal and request to cancel. Withdrawing from the university does NOT automatically cancel your policy or financial obligation for the premium.\n\nMake the request in writing during the open enrollment period for the policy you have purchased and have not utilized the policy prior to making the request. You must provide proof of alternative coverage by logging in here: https://healthcompliance.fsu.edu/insurance/\n\nIf you purchased the spring/summer policy and have NOT used the policy, and you make the request during open enrollment period for that term, you may request to cancel. Approval will be made after the above criteria is met.\n\nIf you purchased the annual policy and request in the spring term to cancel the policy, this would not meet the criteria above. The annual policy has been active for a full semester. Premium amounts will still be due, and the policy will not be cancelled\n\nPlease note that obtaining a different policy (i.e., from a new job, newly married, cheaper option found, etc.) after the start date of the student health insurance policy does not meet the criteria.\n\nOnce I submit my health insurance information or purchase health insurance, when will the charge for the Student Health Insurance Policy (SHIP) be removed?\n\nThe charge will be removed within 48-72 hrs after you have successfully waived with your own insurance policy or purchased the SHIP.\n\nHow do I obtain an insurance card?\n\nTo obtain an insurance card from UHCSR, go online to UHCSR.com/fsu. Once there, click on Login to My Account and sign in with your selected username and password. If you do not have a username and password, you will first need to select Create Account. Then, login in to My Account and pick the ID card link to see a digital version. You may also print and request a hard copy of your ID.\n\nWho is required to show proof of health insurance?\n\nAll domestic students taking a full course load are required to show insurance comparable to the health insurance plan offered for FSU students.\n\nAll international students in F1, J1, J2, or F2 visa status enrolling in any number of FSU credit hours are required to show proof of health insurance that is compliant with the Florida Board of Governor's regulation 6.009. Dependents with J-2 visas are required to be insured regardless of whether or not they are enrolled in FSU courses, per federal immigration regulations.\n\nPlease see the Student Insurance Requirement Policy for more details\n\nWho is not required to show proof of health insurance?\n\nDomestic students studying at the Panama City FSU campus and the Republic of Panama FSU campus.\n\nDistance learning students.\n\nDomestic students studying in other designated special programs at FSU such as transient students, dual-enrolled students and co-op students.\n\nDomestic students taking less than the full course load.\n\nDomestic students taking fewer than 12 undergraduate credit hours or fewer than 9 graduate credit hours in the fall and spring terms and fewer than 6 hours in the summer may contact the Health Compliance Office for a credit hour under load to clear the insurance requirement.\n\nPlease see the Student Insurance Requirement Policy for more details\n\nWhat happens if I don't show proof of health insurance?\n\nYou will be automatically enrolled in the student health insurance plan. The cost of the term for enrollment will be added to your student account and you will be responsible to pay the cost.\n\nWhy is having health insurance important?\n\nHealth insurance provides protection for the unexpected illnesses and injuries that can interrupt your education and takes care of the expenses for preventative and routine health care. Part of our mission at the health center is to ensure that students at Florida State have the opportunity to optimize their entire university educational experience through good health. Students without health insurance often neglect their health or defer their health care because of the expense. No student should have to decide between continuing his or her education or paying a medical bill.\n\nI am a graduate student and received the graduate subsidy for health insurance. Where can I receive more information on this?\n\nAdditional information on the Health Insurance Subsidy benefit can be found at: https://gradschool.fsu.edu/funding-awards/subsidy-benefit.\n\nAdditional Insurance Options\n\nIf your annual taxable income is at least $13,590, you may qualify for affordable, if not free, health insurance through the Federal Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nReach out to Big Bend AHEC at bigbendahec.org or by phone at (850) 224-1177 to speak to a certified health insurance navigator for more information.\n\nWaive + Elect FAQs\n\nWhy am I seeing the message \"We were unable to find a student's record for the submitted information\" when I select \"I have insurance\"?\n\nStudents who have successfully completed this requirement should have received an email stating that no further action is needed. Additionally, the \"to-do\" item should no longer appear in your task list, and your student status is marked as exempt from this requirement.\n\nDoes the Student Health Insurance Plan offered by United Student Health Care Resources cover me internationally if I am studying abroad?\n\nYes, the Student Health Insurance Policy may be found here for your review: https://www.uhcsr.com/school-page. More information regarding what insurance is required for a student studying abroad may be found at: https://international.fsu.edu/Students.aspx#HealthSafety\n\nWhat is ACA compliant?\n\nCommon Insurance Terms can be found at https://studentinsurance.fsu.edu/common-terms.\n\nIf you are unsure if your plan is ACA compliant, please call the number on the back of your insurance card to confirm with your insurance provider directly.\n\nWhat does it mean to have in-network providers in Leon County?\n\nIf you are unsure that your insurance covers you in the Leon County area, please call the number on the back of your insurance card to confirm with your insurance provider directly.\n\nWhat do I do if my appeal was denied?\n\nStudents will have two opportunities to appeal in the UHCSR portal. Please ensure that you use both appeals before proceeding to the step below.\n\nIf both appeals were denied and you would still like your policy to be reviewed, you may submit an email appeal directly to United Healthcare Student Resources via email.\n\nThe email appeal will be sent as a reply to the original email from UHCSR (the email that stated your policy was denied). Please ensure that you include the following information in your email.\n\nStudent name, university, EMPLID, and confirmation of coverage.\n\nAll Waiver Appeals must include a Certificate of Coverage (COC) from your Insurance Provider that confirms your dates of coverage and your policy benefit document in English that specifies the waiver requirements set forth by your institution have been met.\n\nIf your policy was denied due to ACA non-compliance, please call your insurance company to ensure that your plan meets the essential benefits required by the ACA. It is advantageous to your appeal to have documentation that states your plan meets ACA requirements."
