        "text": "Many of Haggard’s songs were drawn from his own hardscrabble life. He was born during the Great Depression near Bakersfield, California, where his family had been living for three years, having fled Oklahoma after a fire destroyed their farm. They were thought of as “Okies.” Following his father’s death when Merle was nine, his mother encouraged his interest in music, hoping it would keep him out of trouble. It didn’t. He was constantly arrested for truancy and other offenses – and just as constantly escaping from juvenile detention centers. Eventually, when he was 20 years old, his crimes landed him in San Quentin for two and a half years.\n\nAfter his parole, Haggard returned to Bakersfield and joined Buck Owens’s band, performing in the local honky tonks every night, and got a day job digging ditches. His own solo career took off when he turned to themes reflecting his own experiences: “Sing Me Back Home,” drawn from his time in prison, “Mama Tried,” about his reckless younger years, and “Hungry Eyes,” about growing up poor — part of a remarkable streak of 37 straight Top 10 hits in the late 1960s, including 23 No. 1 singles. He never looked back – and was still touring and recording as he neared age 80. Along the way, Merle always went out of his way to acknowledge the deep legacy of country artists who had influenced him, especially Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Wills, and Lefty Frizzell.\n\nAmong Haggard’s hundreds of awards and honors are his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and a GRAMMY Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. He accepted a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor on December 4, 2010, for his “outstanding contribution to American culture.” His childhood home – a converted boxcar in Oildale – is today part of the Kern County Museum, having been preserved and restored as a monument to Merle and the thousands of other hard-working Okies who came to California to build new lives.\n\nMerle Haggard died from complications of pneumonia at his home in California on the morning of his 79th birthday."
