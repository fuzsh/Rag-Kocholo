        "text": "Chaka Khan\n\nAmerican singer\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 8, 2024, 11:10 PM ET (CBS)\n\n\"Queen of Funk\" Chaka Khan, a 10-time Grammy winner, added as Baltimore Artscape headliner\n\nChaka Khan (born March 23, 1953, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) is an American singer whose incredible vocal range and dynamic stage presence helped make her the “Queen of Funk.” She has sold some 70 million records, backed by such hits as “I Feel for You” and “Through the Fire” (both 1984).\n\nEarly life\n\nYvette Stevens is the eldest of five children born to Sandra Coleman and Charles Stevens. Both parents worked at the University of Chicago, and the family lived in the progressive Hyde Park neighbourhood on Chicago’s South Side. Her parents ultimately divorced, and her father remarried. Yvette Stevens became interested in music at a young age, and her early influences included Gladys Knight and Billie Holiday. With her sister Yvonne Stevens—who later took the stage name Taka Boom—the 11-year-old Yvette Stevens created a girl group called the Crystalettes.\n\nStevens was also involved in politics, and at age 14 she joined the Black Panther Party, the Black power organization founded by Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton. During this time a Yoruba priest gave her a new name: Chaka Adunne Aduffe Yemoja Hodarhi Karifi. In 1969 she left the Panthers after becoming “physically sick” when she was given a gun. Also that year she dropped out of high school.\n\nSinging career: Rufus\n\nKarifi began singing with various Chicago groups, including Lyfe. One of her bandmates was Hassan Khan, and the couple married in 1970. She took the name Chaka Khan, which she kept after they later divorced. In 1972, members of the funk band Rufus asked her to replace departing singer Paulette McWilliams. Khan’s powerful voice and captivating performances brought more attention to Rufus, and in 1973 the group signed with ABC Records. Later that year the band released its self-titled debut album, but the recording did not perform well commercially, and radio play was sparse.\n\nThe band’s fortunes changed with its follow-up, Rags to Rufus, which appeared in 1974. The album included the single “Tell Me Something Good,” which was written by superstar Stevie Wonder, who gave the song to the band to record. The single became a hit for Rufus, and the group performed it on the TV show Soul Train, hosted by Don Cornelius. “Tell Me Something Good” also earned the group a Grammy Award for best R&B vocal performance by a duo, group, or chorus in 1975. The second single released from Rags to Rufus, “You Got the Love,” was written by Khan and Ray Parker, Jr., and it reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Recognizing the appeal of its charismatic lead singer, the group changed its name to Rufus featuring Chaka Khan and later Rufus and Chaka Khan.\n\nSolo success\n\nWhile still a member of Rufus, Chaka Khan released her debut solo album, Chaka, in 1978. The album featured the hit single “I’m Every Woman,” which blends rock and disco; it was penned by the songwriting duo Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. In addition, Khan was featured on other artists’ songs, and she notably sang lead vocals with Ashford and Simpson on the Quincy Jones single “Stuff Like That” (1978). Jones then produced the 1979 Rufus album Masterjam, and its standout songs include “Do You Love What You Feel.” By the end of the 1970s, the band had released six gold- or platinum-selling albums.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The double album features live performances as well as studio recordings, which include the Grammy-winning hit single “Ain’t Nobody.” Rufus disbanded later in 1983.\n\nDuring this time, Khan recorded several solo albums, including Chaka Khan (1982), which features the jazz-infused “Be Bop Medley” and “Got to Be There.” Both songs and the album received Grammy Awards. Khan’s major breakthrough to a mainstream audience came in 1984 with the release of her fifth solo album, I Feel for You. The eponymous title track was written by Prince, who reportedly was a major fan of Khan, and it became an international hit. Khan’s version features Melle Mel of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five—whose rap section includes the memorable line “Chaka, Chaka, Chaka, Chaka Khan”—and Stevie Wonder plays the harmonica on the track. The song earned both Prince and Chaka Khan Grammy Awards. The album also features “Through the Fire,” a popular ballad.\n\nIn 1989 Khan had another hit single, with the Jones-produced “I’ll Be Good to You,” sharing lead vocals with Ray Charles. For the song, Khan won her sixth Grammy Award. Her 1992 studio album, The Woman I Am, won a Grammy for best R&B vocal performance for a female performer. Khan’s career subsequently stalled, though she continued to produce solo material while also collaborating with other artists. She notably recorded the Grammy-winning single “What’s Going On” (2002) with the Funk Brothers.\n\nIn 2007 Khan had a major comeback with the release of Funk This, which reached number 15 on the Billboard 200 chart. It received the Grammy for best R&B album, and “Disrespectful,” a collaboration with Mary J. Blige, won the award for best R&B performance by a duo or group with vocals. Khan did not release another recording until the 2019 album Hello Happiness. Three years later her single “Woman Like Me” appeared. In 2023 Khan was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nOther activities and personal life\n\nKhan branched out into acting. Her credits include a cameo in the 1980 comedy The Blues Brothers, starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, and a guest role (1987) on the TV series Hunter. She also appeared as herself in a number of shows, including an episode (2019) of Empire. In addition, Khan acted on the stage. In 1995 she played Sister Carrie in a London production of the gospel musical Mama I Want To Sing!, and in 2008 she made her Broadway debut, portraying Sofia in The Color Purple, an adaptation of Alice Walker’s acclaimed novel.\n\nKhan has been married three times. She has two children, daughter Indira Milini Khan and son Damien Holland. In 2004 Holland was arrested and charged with murder in the shooting death of his friend Chris Bailey. Holland claimed that he accidentally fired the weapon, and Khan testified in court on her son’s behalf. He was found not guilty in 2006. Khan later spoke out about her struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. She and her sister Yvonne Stevens (Taka Boom) went into rehab for prescription-drug addiction in 2016, following the death of Khan’s close friend Prince, who had accidentally overdosed.\n\nIn 2003 Khan published the memoir Chaka! Through the Fire (written with Tonya Bolden)."
