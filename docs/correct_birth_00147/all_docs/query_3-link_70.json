        "text": "Who can sign a document filed with the secretary of state under the Texas Business Organizations Code (BOC)?\n\nWho can sign a document filed with the secretary of state depends on the type of entity, whether the entity is domestic or foreign, and the type of document. For Texas filing entities, use the table below. For other types of entities, see the information following the domestic entities table.\n\nAuthorized signers for domestic filing entities. Instructions for table: Choose the type of entity at the top and the type of document on the left. The cell where the two choices match up contains the answer to who can sign the document. For example, a nonprofit corporation certificate of formation must be signed by each organizer.\n\nDomestic Entity Corporation\n\n(for-profit, nonprofit, professional) Limited Partnership LLC/PLLC Professional Association Cooperative Association\n\nFormation\n\nEach organizer (BOC § 3.004) Each general partner (BOC § 3.004) Each organizer (BOC § 3.004) Each member (BOC § 3.015(a)(1)) Each organizer (BOC § 3.004)\n\nCorrection (BOC § 4.101)\n\nA person authorized to sign the document being corrected\n\nAmendment\n\nChange of registered agent by entity\n\nMerger*\n\nConversion\n\nTermination\n\nReinstatement\n\nafter termination for non-tax reasons\n\nOfficer (BOC §§ 20.001, 303.001) General partner(s) (BOC §§ 153.052, 153.553) Authorized officer, manager, or member (BOC § 101.0515) Officer (BOC §§ 302.001, 20.001) Authorized officer (BOC §§ 251.002, 251.052, 20.001)\n\nReinstatement after tax forfeiture (Tax Code § 171.313)\n\nStockholder, director, or officer at time of forfeiture Any partner at time of forfeiture Officer, manager, or member at time of forfeiture Member, officer, or director at time of forfeiture N/A\n\n* A certificate of merger may require the signature of a representative of each party to the merger.\n\nLimited liability partnership registration and other LLP filings. Must be signed by a majority-in-interest of the partners or by at least one partner authorized by a majority-in-interest, with the exception that an application by a limited partnership to become a limited liability partnership or withdraw a registration must be signed by at least one general partner. BOC §§ 152.802, 152.905, 153.352.\n\nFilings by a registered agent, including change of registered agent submitted by the registered agent, rejection of appointment as registered agent, or registered agent resignation. Must be signed by the person named as registered agent. BOC §§ 4.001, 5.203, 5.205.\n\nAuthorized signers for foreign entity filings (except LLPs). Authorized signers are determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of formation.\n\nHow should my documents be signed? Does the form of the signature matter?\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of State is a ministerial filing office, and cannot assist you in determining the appropriate signature format for your situation, but the following general information may be helpful. An individual signing on his own behalf, such as a sole proprietor, may simply sign his name and type or write his name below:\n\nSigning on behalf of an entity requires more caution. Individuals have been held personally liable for contracts based on the way they signed them. A signature block should clearly indicate in what capacity an individual is signing. On secretary of state forms, when signing on behalf of an entity, enter the name of the entity at “By.”\n\nDoes the signature on my document need to be notarized?\n\nIn most cases, documents submitted to the Secretary of State for filing are not required to be notarized. The Business Organizations Code (BOC) does not require the notarization of signatures on filing instruments. However, documents governed by codes or statutes other than the BOC might need to be notarized. For example, each organizer of an entity created under certain parts of the Local Government Code must sign and verify the formation document. A verification is formal swearing to or affirming the truth of the statements in a document before a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths. If you are submitting a document for an entity created under a code or statute other than the BOC, you should check the requirements of that code or statute to determine whether the document needs to be notarized.\n\nAlso note that while assumed name certificates filed with the county clerk must be notarized, assumed name certificates that are filed with the secretary of state do not need to be notarized.\n\nMay I file now and make my filing effective at a later date and/or time?\n\nCertain filings may be made effective on a date and/or time after the date of receipt. The delayed effective date may be no more than (90) days from the date the instrument is signed. A time also may be provided along with the delayed effective date; however, the time may not be specified as midnight, noon, 12:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m. The time provided will always be entered into our computer system using Central Time even if the document specifies time from another time zone.\n\nWhere permitted, the secretary of state forms explain delayed effectiveness in greater detail. A delayed effectiveness provision must be stated within a document; instructions relating to the effectiveness in a cover letter are insufficient.\n\nDelayed effectiveness is not permitted for:\n\na reservation of a name,\n\na registration of a name,\n\na statement of event or fact filing, or\n\na certificate of abandonment.\n\nIn addition, there is no provision in Chapter 71 of the Business & Commerce Code for delayed effectiveness for an assumed name certificates or an abandonment of assumed name certificate."
