        "text": "Vital Statistics Section (VSS) cannot release any information without an application, payment, and acceptable ID submitted by a qualified applicant. VSS can issue a birth verification letter stating whether a record of birth is on file with the State of Texas with a written request. If a record is filed, the verification letter will include the person's name, the date of birth, and the county where the birth occurred. Verification letters are available for births that have occurred since 1903. Verification letters are not considered legal substitutes for certified copies of birth certificates. VSS strongly recommends that applicants ensure a verification will satisfy its intended use. Visit the Birth Records webpage for more information, including methods and requirements for ordering a birth verification.\n\nFor births within the past 75 years, only the immediate family members of the person whose name is on the birth certificate are eligible to request a copy. Visit the Persons Qualified to Request or Change Records webpage for full details, including who is considered an immediate family member.\n\nFor mail-in orders, you must present original ID to get a notary seal on your application. You must include a photocopy of acceptable ID with your application in the mail. Do not send original IDs in the mail.\n\nFor in-person orders, you must present the original acceptable ID.\n\nFor online orders, your identity is verified using an online database. For details on what information you must provide to verify your identity online, visit the Requirements for Online Orders webpage.\n\nAn acceptable form of ID is required to process your application. Visit the Acceptable ID webpage for complete details.\n\nIf you do not have acceptable ID, an immediate family member with sufficient ID may also obtain the birth certificate. Visit the Persons Qualified to Request or Change Records webpage for full details, including who is considered an immediate family member.\n\nFor most changes, yes. Originals and/or certified copies of supporting documents used to correct a record will be returned once the correction is completed.\n\nHowever, when adding/removing/replacing a parent's name, certified documents submitted will be retained by VS and placed in a sealed file. A court order is required to unseal a file. Parents should keep copies of certified documents for their records and future use before sending them to VS.\n\nViwq the application for other circumstances when the original records are kept by our office."
