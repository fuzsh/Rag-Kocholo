        "text": "Choosing your birth location\n\nYou can give birth at home, in a unit run by midwives (a midwifery unit or birth centre) or in hospital.\n\nYour choices about where to have your baby depend on your needs, risks and, to some extent, on where you live.\n\nYou can usually consider any of these birth locations. But if your pregnancy is high risk or you have certain medical conditions, it's safest to give birth in hospital, where specialists are available. This is in case you need treatment during labour.\n\nIf your pregnancy is low risk and you give birth at home or in a unit run by midwives, you’re less likely to need assistance such as forceps or ventouse (sometimes called instrumental delivery).\n\nWherever you choose, the place should feel right for you. You can change your mind at any point in your pregnancy.\n\nFind out what's in your area\n\nYour midwife will discuss the options available in your area but if you're willing to travel, you're free to choose any maternity services.\n\nAs well as from your midwife, you can get information from:\n\nchildren's centres\n\nyour GP surgery\n\nlocal maternity units – find maternity services near you\n\nYou may also want to get advice from your friends and family.\n\nTalk to your midwife about going to have a look around the local maternity services, and ask questions if you do not understand something or think you need to know more. Some hospitals also offer virtual tours on their websites.\n\nHome birth\n\nYou can choose to give birth at home. This is usually only recommended if you have a straightforward pregnancy, and both you and the baby are well.\n\nGiving birth is generally safe wherever you choose to have your baby.\n\nBut if you’re having your first baby, home birth slightly increases the risk of serious problems for the baby – including death or issues that might affect the baby's quality of life – from 5 in 1,000 for a hospital birth to 9 in 1,000 for a home birth.\n\nIf you've had a baby before, a planned home birth is as safe as having your baby in hospital or a midwife-led unit.\n\nIt's rare, but if something goes seriously wrong during your labour at home, it could be worse for you or your baby than if you were in hospital with access to specialised care.\n\nIf you give birth at home, you'll be supported by a midwife who will be with you while you're in labour. If you need any help or your labour is not progressing as well as it should, your midwife will make arrangements for you to go to hospital.\n\nAdvantages of home birth\n\nThe advantages of giving birth at home include:\n\nbeing in familiar surroundings, where you may feel more relaxed and better able to cope\n\nnot having to interrupt your labour to go into hospital\n\nnot needing to leave your other children\n\nnot having to be separated from your partner after the birth\n\nincreased likelihood of being looked after by a midwife you have got to know during your pregnancy\n\nif your pregnancy is low risk, a lower likelihood of having an intervention, such as forceps or ventouse (vacuum delivery), than giving birth in hospital\n\nConsiderations\n\nThere are some things you should think about if you're considering a home birth.\n\nYou may need to transfer to a hospital if there are complications.\n\nEpidurals are not available at home, but you can use gas and air, a warm bath, a birth pool, TENS and any relaxation techniques you've learned. Find out about pain relief in labour.\n\nYour doctor or midwife may recommend you give birth in hospital – for example, if you're expecting twins or if your baby is lying feet first (breech). Your midwife or doctor will explain why they think a hospital birth is safer for you and your baby.\n\nIf you choose to give birth at home or in a unit run by midwives, you should be given information by your midwife or GP about what would happen if you had to be transferred to hospital during labour and how long this would take.\n\nPlanning a home birth\n\nAsk your midwife whether a home birth is suitable for you and your baby.\n\nIf you choose to have a home birth, your midwife will arrange for members of the midwifery team to help and support you. Here are some questions you might want to ask:\n\nhow long would it take if I needed to be transferred to hospital?\n\nwhich hospital would I be transferred to?\n\nwould a midwife be with me all the time?\n\nhow do I get a birthing pool?\n\nMidwifery units or birth centres\n\nMidwifery units or birth centres are more comfortable and homely than a maternity unit in a hospital. They can be:\n\npart of a hospital maternity unit, where pregnancy (obstetric), newborn (neonatal) and anaesthetic care is available\n\nseparate from a hospital, and without immediate obstetric, neonatal or anaesthetic care\n\nAdvantages of a midwifery unit or birth centre\n\nThe advantages of giving birth at a midwifery unit include:\n\nbeing in surroundings where you may feel more relaxed and better able to cope with labour\n\nbeing more likely to be looked after by a midwife you have got to know during your pregnancy\n\nthe unit potentially being much nearer your home\n\nif your pregnancy is low risk, a lower likelihood of having an intervention such as forceps or ventouse (vacuum delivery) than giving birth in hospital\n\nConsiderations\n\nThere are some things to think about if you're considering giving birth in a midwifery unit or birth centre.\n\nYou may need to be transferred to a hospital if there are any complications.\n\nIn a unit that's completely separate from a hospital, you won't be able to have certain kinds of pain relief, such as an epidural. Ask your midwife whether the unit or centre is part of a hospital or completely separate.\n\nYour doctor or midwife may feel it's safer for you to give birth in hospital.\n\nPlanning a birth in a midwifery unit or birth centre\n\nAsk your midwife if there are any midwifery units or birth centres in your area. There may be others you can use if you're prepared to travel.\n\nHospital birth\n\nMost births happen in an NHS hospital maternity unit. If you choose to give birth in hospital, you'll be looked after by midwives, but doctors will be available if you need their help.\n\nYou'll still have choices about the kind of care you want. Your midwives and doctors will provide information about what your hospital can offer.\n\nAdvantages of hospital birth\n\nThe advantages of giving birth in hospital include:\n\ndirect access to obstetricians if your labour becomes complicated\n\ndirect access to anaesthetists, who give epidurals\n\nthere will be specialists in newborn care (neonatologists) and a special care baby unit if there are any problems with your baby\n\nConsiderations\n\nThere are some things you should think about if you're considering a hospital birth:\n\nyou may go home directly from the labour ward or you may be moved to a postnatal ward\n\nin hospital, you may be looked after by a different midwife from the one who looked after you during your pregnancy\n\nyou're more likely to have an epidural, episiotomy, or a forceps or ventouse delivery in hospital\n\nPlanning a hospital birth\n\nYour midwife can help you decide which hospital feels right for you. If there's more than one hospital in your area, you can choose which one to go to. Find out more about the care provided in each so you can decide which will suit you best.\n\nBirth questions to ask\n\nHere are some questions you might want to ask if you're considering having your baby in a midwifery unit or birth centre, or in hospital:\n\nAre tours of the maternity facilities available before the birth?\n\nWhen can I discuss my birth plan?\n\nAre TENS machines available for pain relief or do I need to hire one?\n\nWhat equipment is available – for example mats, a birthing chair or bean bags?\n\nAre there birthing pools?\n\nAre partners, close relatives or friends welcome in the delivery room?\n\nAre they ever asked to leave the room – if so, why?\n\nCan I move around in labour and find my own position for the birth?\n\nWhat is the policy on induction, pain relief and routine monitoring?\n\nWhat types of pain relief are available, such as epidurals?\n\nHow soon can I go home after the birth?\n\nWhat services are provided for premature or sick babies?\n\nWho will help me if I breastfeed?\n\nWho will help me if I choose to formula feed?\n\nWill my baby be with me all the time or is there a separate nursery?\n\nAre there any special rules about visiting?\n\nHow long would it take if I needed to be transferred to hospital from a birth centre?\n\nWhich hospital would I be transferred to?\n\nWould a midwife be with me all the time?\n\nWherever you decide to give birth, you can change your mind at any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your midwife if there's anything you're not sure or want to know more about.\n\nFind out more about your choice of place of birth on the Birthrights website\n\nIf you are thinking about unassisted birth\n\nYou can choose to have a home birth without a midwife with you (unassisted birth). This is sometimes called freebirth.\n\nTalk to a midwife if you are worried about your care.\n\nThey can:\n\ndiscuss with you the role of the midwife and help you make an informed choice\n\npersonalise your care and support so it’s right for you.\n\nIf you decide to have an unassisted birth, you can change your mind at any time during your pregnancy or labour. NHS midwives will always be available to support you.\n\nA midwife can offer you support and advice during labour, and check on the health of you and your baby. They'll know if you or your baby need help, and can arrange for medical attention if needed.\n\nIf you have an unassisted birth, you’ll need to tell a GP or local maternity services about your baby’s birth as soon as they’ve been born. This is because by law every birth in the UK needs to be recorded (notified) within 36 hours. A GP or midwife will need to see you before they can notify the birth.\n\nWhen the birth has been notified, your baby will get an NHS number for their NHS care.\n\nFind out more about freebirth, unassisted childbirth and unassisted pregnancy on the AIMS website"
