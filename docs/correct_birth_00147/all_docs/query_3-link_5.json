I noticed that my name was a sentence, meaning one with will, who is strong-willed.\n\n“And so I called my mom and said, ‘Hey, Mom, do you mind if I call myself Will.i.am?’ She was like: ‘Whaaa? You’re crazy.’ She was cool with it.”\n\nWho's he dating?\n\nIt appears that Will.i.am is currently single.\n\nSpeaking about his love life, Will told the Mirror: \"I don't have time for girlfriends, and that's why I just keep busy.
