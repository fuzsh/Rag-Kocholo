        "text": "Obtaining a Copy of a Birth Record\n\nOnly certain individuals are allowed to receive an authorized certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record. An authorized certified copy of a birth record is required to obtain a driver's license, passport, social security card and other services related to an individual's identity.\n\nWho Can Receive an Authorized Certified Copy\n\nThe registrant or a parent or legal guardian of the registrant\n\nA child, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner of the registrant\n\nA party entitled to receive the record as a result of a court order, or an attorney or a licensed adoption agency seeking the birth record in order to comply with the requirements of Section 3140 or 7603 of the Family Code\n\nA member of a law enforcement agency or a representative of another governmental agency, as provided by law, who is conducting official business\n\nAn attorney representing the registrant or the registrant's estate, or any person or agency empowered by statute or appointed by a court to act on behalf of the registrant or the registrant estate\n\nInformational Certified Copies\n\nThose who are not authorized or do not wish to submit the notarized Certificate of Identity may receive an Informational Certified Copy.\n\nInformational Certified Copies have the words \"INFORMATIONAL, NOT A VALID DOCUMENT TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY,\" imprinted across the face of the copy.\n\nAuthorized vs. Informational Certified Copies:\n\nAuthorized copies are used for legal purposes. Informational copies are used for mostly non-legal purposes and ancestry.\n\nBirth Record Request Options\n\nOnline Request\n\nIn-person Request\n\nMail Request\n\nThe REAL ID Act\n\nTo obtain a REAL ID some individuals may need a copy of their birth and/or marriage certificate, and possibly amend a record for accuracy. We encourage customers to review the requirements to obtain a REAL ID driver's license.\n\nCheck the requirements with your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to help plan and minimize potential delays to obtain the required documentation.\n\nInformation on the requirements for California's REAL ID can be found on the DMV's REAL ID Interactive Checklist."
