        "text": "If eligible, you can receive about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date for up to 8 weeks within any 12-month period. The length of time worked at your current job does not affect eligibility.\n\nTo learn more, visit Calculating Paid Family Leave Benefit Payment Amounts or use the Weekly Benefit Amount Calculator to estimate your benefit amount.\n\nYou can apply for PFL by completing the Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits (DE 2501F) form online or by mail.\n\nTo apply online, you must first create an account with myEDD to access SDI Online. Visit the myEDD login page and select Create Account to get started. For more information, visit How to File a PFL Claim in SDI Online.\n\nmyEDD registration is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nAfter you have created an account and logged back in to myEDD, select SDI Online, which will direct you to the SDI Online Registration page. Select your account type and complete the requested information. Once your SDI Online registration is complete, log in to myEDD again and select SDI Online once more to be directed to your Home page to file your claim.\n\nNote: It may be necessary to send some documents via U.S. mail even if you selected electronic communication.\n\nTo apply by mail, visit How to File a PFL Claim by Mail.\n\nFor bonding claims, your application must include documentation showing the relationship between you and your new child (for example, a copy of the child’s birth certificate or record, adoptive placement agreement, or foster care placement record).\n\nNote: Mothers transitioning from a Disability Insurance pregnancy claim to a PFL bonding claim do not have to provide a proof of relationship document.\n\nFor caregiving claims, your application must also include a medical certification from your family member’s physician/practitioner and the care recipient’s or their authorized representative’s signature on the Statement of Care Recipient portion of the claim form.\n\nFor military assist claims, you must include supporting military documentation and documentation for the qualifying event.\n\nYes. If you have a family member who becomes sick while you are out of work, you can apply for a Paid Family Leave claim which can provide a higher benefit amount if you’re eligible. A medical certification is required to verify your family member’s illness. If you are approved for a Paid Family Leave claim, your Unemployment Insurance (UI) claim will be put on hold. If your Paid Family Leave claim ends and you are still unemployed, you may return to your UI claim benefits as long as you are still out of work and otherwise eligible. You will need to reapply to reopen your UI claim."
