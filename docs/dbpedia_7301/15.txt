Which one of these doesn’t belong? I can’t get over this publicity photo of Disney great Bill Tytla, with Isadore Sparber and Seymour Kneitel together in the same 1945 publicity shot for Famous Studios—pitching a background painting to Little Lulu!). Yes we all know they worked together in the mid-40s, I just never saw a photo of them standing together—an odd couple (triple?) indeed! This is one of several behind the scenes photos from Famous Studio I plan to post one day (when I have a spare moment).
