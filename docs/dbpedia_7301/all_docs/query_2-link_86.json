        "text": "Maltin, Leonard (1980, rev. 1988). Pg. 321-322] In 1966, the studio subcontracted \"The Mighty Thor\" cartoons from Grantray-Lawrence Animation, producers of \"The Marvel Superheroes\" animated TV series. However, when Paramount's board of directors rejected a proposal to produce episodes for a second Grantray-Lawrence series, \"Spider-Man\", Culhane quit the studio, and was replaced by former Terrytoons animator Ralph Bakshi in mid-1967. Although Bakshi quickly put several experimental shorts into production, by the fall of 1967, Paramount's new owners, Gulf and Western, had begun the process of shutting down the animation studio, a task completed in December.\n\nCurrent ownership of Paramount cartoons\n\nToday, several companies own different components of the Paramount animated library. Time Warner owns all of the Paramount \"Popeye\" cartoons via their Turner Entertainment division, following several company mergers and purchases involving the a.a.p. film library. In addition, Time Warner (via its DC Comics unit) owns the masters to the \"Superman\" cartoons, although all seventeen of the series' entries are in the public domain. Classic Media now owns the Harvey comics properties, which include the 1950-1962 Paramount cartoons and the original characters created by Famous before 1959.\n\nViacom, Paramount's current parent company, owns what was once the U.M.&M. library via their Republic Pictures arm. This library includes the rights to all of the Paramount cartoons - Fleischer and Famous - produced before 1950 which do not feature Popeye, Superman and 1950-1962 Harvey Comic properties (currently owned by Classic Media). However, a significant number of these cartoons did not have their copyrights renewed, and have fallen into the public domain. Numerous public domain sourced home video collections feature Paramount cartoons which were sold to U.M.&M. Paramount itself continues to hold the theatrical rights to the post-1962 cartoon shorts.\n\nCBS Television Distribution (a unit of the current incarnation of CBS Corporation) holds the television rights to the cartoons under Republic Pictures' ownership. Republic has licensed the home video/DVD rights to the former U.M.&M. package to Lionsgate Home Entertainment, although official re-releases have yet to be announced.\n\nFilmography\n\nTheatrical short subjects series\n\n*\"Popeye the Sailor\" (inherited from Fleischer Studios, 1942 &ndash; 1957)\n\n*\"Superman\" (inherited from Fleischer Studios, 1942 &ndash; 1943)\n\n*\"Noveltoons\" (1943 &ndash; 1967)\n\n*\"Little Audrey\" (1948 &ndash; 1959)\n\n*\"Little Lulu\" (1943 &ndash; 1948)\n\n*\"Screen Songs\" (1947 &ndash; 1951; originally produced by Fleischer Studios 1929 &ndash; 1938)\n\n*\"Casper the Friendly Ghost\" (1950 &ndash; 1959)\n\n*\"Kartunes\" (1951 &ndash; 1953)\n\n*\"Herman and Katnip\" (1952 &ndash; 1959)\n\n*\"Modern Madcaps\" (1958 &ndash; 1967)\n\n*\"Jeepers and Creepers\" (1960)\n\n*\"The Cat\" (1961)\n\n*\"Swifty and Shorty\" (1964 &ndash; 1965)\n\n*\"Honey Halfwitch\" (1965 &ndash; 1967)\n\n*\"Merry Makers\" (1967)\n\n*\"GoGo Toons\" (1967)\n\n*\"Fractured Fables\" (1967)\n\nTelevision series\n\n*Segments of \"Popeye\" (1960 &ndash; 1962; outsourced from King Features)\n\n*\"The New Casper Cartoon Show\" (1962 &ndash; 1963, produced for Harvey Films)\n\n*Segments of \"King Features Trilogy\" (1963 &ndash; 1965; outsourced from King Features)\n\n**Twelve of the Paramount-produced shorts in this series were released theatrically in 1962 under the title \"Comic Kings\"\n\n*\"The Mighty Thor\" segments of \"The Marvel Superheroes\" (1966; outsourced from Grantray-Lawrence Animation)\n\nReferences\n\nee also\n\n*Fleischer Studios\n\nExternal links"
