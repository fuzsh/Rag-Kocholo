        "text": "“How a Cartoon is Produced” on page 6 of \"Paramount News\" (Volume III No.11 March 12, 1951) shows the basic steps in the process of creating a cartoon (click to enlarge image)… the accompanying text is as follows…\n\n“Our cameraman spent all last week with Producers Isadore Sparber and Seymour Kneitel photographing the various steps necessary to make one of the popular Paramount cartoons. Little did we realize the amount of hard work that goes into the making of the ‘exhibitor’s best program builder.” But suppose you join us on a personally conducted tour of the cartoon studio. First, let’s meet Irving Spector as he completes the last sketch of a Popeye story in preparation for a final story conference. With the story approved, Animator Nick Tafuri is shown 2. as he strikes a pose for the action he is about to draw. His pencil sketches are photographed by Matthew Gentilella 3. for reviewing by head animator and director, who will assign the work to assistant animators and “fillers-in” 4. Now, with the animation well under way, Bob Owen, Bob Connavle and John Zago prepare the backgrounds. 5. Aftr the animators pencil sketches are traced in black ink, Alice Rehberg, Ruth Gorman and Joan Saracina match the transparent acetate sheets for the next step which is the coloring. 6. Here Peter Ignatenko, Eugene Babitchev and Maria Serianni prepare the colors in the paint laboratory. 7. As an added precaution, Alice Ament matches the colors as she test-paints some of the transparent sheets. 8. It is at this point that Music Director Winston Sharples creates and arranges special music as 9. Morris Manne and Bernice Steinberg edit the cartoon for sound effects and dialogue. 10. The completed cartoon is screened for the staff and with the approval of Producers Sparber and Knitel (sic), Leonard McCormick photographs the main title and another top-notch Paramount cartoon is ready for selling and booking. It’s just as easy as that!\""
