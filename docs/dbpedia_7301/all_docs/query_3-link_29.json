(Harleygirl) from HURON, SD\n\nReviewed on 9/22/2015...\n\nBought for my grandson, it was great to show him a classic cartoon from my childhood. He really enjoyed it!!\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nAhoy! Great Product for All Popeye Lovers!\n\nClassic Animation Fan | Vancouver | 03/29/2005\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Popeye \"Fists Of Fury\"\n\nI have noticed some mixed reviews about this product with most of the negative ones being ghost written by our competition so i wanted to tell everyone the real truth about this product since we are the people who produced it. I am using my wifes Amazon account to post this.\n\nWe have taken some of the greatest classic cartoons ever produced, from some of the greatest animators in history, and meticulously added hundreds of hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars of detailed restoration to both the sound and images in order to make them look as good as they did the day they were first released. Each cartoon is digitally processed first through photo shop frame by frame, and then using both the Davinci and the new Pogo systems to remove every scratch, line, dropout and artifact possible. We then we do a full color restoration at Technicolor using the original color palates to match the colors, tones and shades. We then digitally clean up the sound track to remove all the hiss and scratches and carefully add new foley sound effects, ambience and digitally remix them back onto the cartoons.\n\nThe result is our animated DVD series which is currently distributed in both the United States and Canada by Goodtimes Entertainment. These fully restored, full motion, color animations have not been seen in this condition since their original theatrical release. Sit back and be amazed and enjoy some of the finest and funniest animation ever made.\n\nthats why were to only studio doing these that have the blessing and participation of Fleischer Studios and the only one to receive the prestigious Gold Medal from the Classic Animation Preservation Society.\n\nI highly recomend this product to any lovers of classic animation.\"\n\nDetails for all 8 cartoons\n\nAnnie Van Auken | Planet Earth | 04/02/2008\n\n(4 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"All eight of the Popeye shorts on this GOOD TIMES VIDEO DVD were produced by Paramount's FAMOUS STUDIOS cartoon division. Animator and storyman Jack Mercer provided the sailor's voice. Orchestrations were by Winston Sharples (formerly of Van Beuren Studiios).\n\nPOPEYE THE SAILOR: WHEN POPEYE RULED THE SEVEN SEAS (also from GTV) features cartoons made by Popeye's animation originators-- FLEISCHER STUDIOS. Included here are several cartoon two-reelers, one of which was the first ever in-color Popeye short.\n\nPROGRAM LIST for \"Popeye: Fists of Fury\" (includes synopses)--\n\nTHE CRYSTAL BRAWL (1957) - A disguised-as-a-fortuneteller Popeye scares Olive away from Bluto when he predicts her future.\n\nSPOOKY SWABS (1957) - Popeye and Olive float on a raft until they board an abandoned and haunted ship.\n\nI DON'T SCARE (1956) - Bluto changes the calendar to Friday the 13th so superstitious Olive won't go out with Popeye.\n\nSPREE LUNCH (1957) - Wimpy cadges free meals at both Popeye's and Bluto's eateries.\n\nStooges in the Woods\n\nPOPEYE'S 20th ANNIVERSARY (1954) - At a testimonial dinner, Paramount actors watch scenes of Popeye's past exploits.\n\nFLOOR FLUSHER (1954) - Popeye repairs Olive's leaky faucet until Bluto sabotages the pipes.\n\nNEARLYWEDS (1957) - Popeye and Olive's wedding plans are ruined when he shows up at the ceremony wearing a barrel.\n\nPARLEZ VOUS WOO (1956) - Bluto adopts a fake French accent to lure Olive from Popeye.\n\nBONUS: Soaky Toys Commercial\""
