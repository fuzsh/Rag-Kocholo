        "text": "This is a list of the 122 cartoons of the Popeye the Sailor film series produced by Famous Studios (later known as Paramount Cartoon Studios) for Paramount Pictures from 1942 to 1957, with 14 in black-and-white and 108 in color.[1] These cartoons were produced after Paramount took ownership of Fleischer Studios, which originated the Popeye series in 1933.\n\nAll cartoons are one-reel in length (6 to 10 minutes). The first 14 shorts (You're a Sap, Mr. Jap through Cartoons Ain't Human) are in black-and-white. All remaining cartoons (beginning with Her Honor the Mare) are in color. Unlike the Fleischer Studios shorts, the director credits for these shorts represent the actual director in charge of that short's production. The first animator credited handled the animation direction. The numbers listed next to each cartoon continue the numbering of the Fleischer entries."
