        "text": "This is a list of the 109 cartoons of the Popeye the Sailor film series produced by Fleischer Studios for Paramount Pictures from 1933 to 1942.[1]\n\nDuring the course of production in 1941, Paramount assumed control of the Fleischer studio, removing founders Max and Dave Fleischer from control of the studio and renaming the organization Famous Studios by 1942. Popeye cartoons continued production under Famous Studios following 1942's Baby Wants a Bottleship.\n\nAll cartoons are one reel (6 to 10 minutes long) and in black and white, except for the three Popeye Color Specials (Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor from 1936, Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves from 1937, and Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp from 1939), which are two reels (15 to 20 minutes long) and in Technicolor.\n\nDave Fleischer was the credited director on every cartoon produced by Fleischer Studios. Fleischer's actual duties were those of a film producer and creative supervisor, with the head animators doing much of the work assigned to animation directors in other studios. The head animator is the first animator listed.[2] Credited animators are therefore listed for each short.\n\nMore information #, Film ...\n\n1933\n\n# Film Original release date Animated by Story by Pilot cartoon Popeye the Sailor July 14[3] Seymour Kneitel\n\nRoland Crandall\n\nFirst screen appearances of Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto\n\nA Betty Boop cartoon\n\nSome TV versions are edited so as to remove scenes depicting racial stereotypes of African Americans\n\nWilliam \"Billy\" Costello was the voice of Popeye.\n\n1 I Yam What I Yam September 29[3] Seymour Kneitel\n\nWilliam Henning\n\nFirst entry in the Popeye the Sailor series\n\nFirst screen appearance of J.
