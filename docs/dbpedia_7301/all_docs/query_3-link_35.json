        "text": "One half of the most celebrated animation-producing duos in history, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's company, Hanna-Barbera Productions, created some of the best-loved animated television programming of the 20th century and beyond, including \"The Huckleberry Hound Show\" (syndicated, 1958-1961), \"The Yogi Bear Show\" (syndicated, 1961-62), \"The Flintstones\" (ABC, 1960-66), \"The Jetsons\" (ABC, 1962-63), \"Jonny Quest\" (ABC, 1964-65), \"Super Friends\" (ABC, 1973-1986) and \"The Smurfs\" (NBC, 1981-89). With Hanna, Barbera began his career with the Oscar-winning Tom and Jerry animated shorts for MGM. When the company shuttered its animation division, the duo launched their own company, striking pay dirt almost immediately with \"Huckleberry Hound\" and \"The Flintstones,\" their first primetime series. Hanna-Barbera's cartoons, driven largely by bright, simple artwork, clever writing, and memorable characters, led the television animation field until the 1980s, when financial difficulties resulted in their sale to a variety of companies. They rebounded in the 1990s as part of Turner Broadcasting's Cartoon Network, for which they oversaw such cutting-edge cartoons as \"The Powerpuff Girls\" (1998-2005) before Hanna's death in 2001. Joseph Barbera's vast output of animated fare over the course of his six-decade career contained so many beloved characters and shows that his position as one of the dominant forces in American animation was assured for eternity.\n\nHayao Miyazaki (宮崎 駿, Miyazaki Hayao, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese animator, filmmaker, screenwriter, author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio, he has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animation filmmakers. Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan. He joined Telecom Animation Film/Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first feature films, The Castle of Cagliostro in 1979 and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1984, as well as the television series Sherlock Hound. Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed multiple films with Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky in 1986, My Neighbor Totoro in 1988, Kiki's Delivery Service in 1989, and Porco Rosso in 1992. The films were met with commercial and critical success in Japan. Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997; its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and considered among the greatest films of the decade. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, and The Wind Rises—also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned to work on a new feature film in 2016. Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history, praising the depth and artistry of his films. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\nAnimator Butch Hartman received the nickname Butch as a kid, and continued to use this name professionally when he started creating programming for children. While attending the California Institute of the Arts, Hartman got a chance to work as an intern for famed animator Don Bluth on the movie \"An American Tail,\" and after he graduated Hartman was hired to work on the kid's cartoon \"My Little Pony.\" For a few years, Hartman worked for Hanna-Barbera on several of their animated shows, but he got a chance to do his own show for Nickelodeon, \"The Fairly OddParents,\" which premiered in 1997. The quirky series followed a 10-year-old kid whose humdrum life is made a lot more interesting when he meets his pair of wish-granting fairy godparents. The show became a big hit, second only to \"SpongeBob SquarePants,\" and Hartman soon followed this with another successful animated show for Nickelodeon, \"Danny Phantom,\" which premiered in 2004. Hartman has also done several voices on his pal Seth MacFarlane's show \"Family Guy.\"\n\nDaniel Kingsley Povenmire (; born September 18, 1963) is an American television director, writer, producer, storyboard artist and voice actor associated with several animated television series. Povenmire is the co-creator of the Disney animated series Phineas and Ferb and Milo Murphy's Law, in which he also voiced the character Heinz Doofenshmirtz in both series. Povenmire grew up in Mobile, Alabama, where he was an art student, and where he spent summers outdoors and making movies. Povenmire attended the University of South Alabama before deciding to pursue a film career and transferring to the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts. Povenmire has been a long-time contributor to the animation business, working on several different animated television series such as Hey Arnold!, The Simpsons, Rocko's Modern Life and SpongeBob SquarePants. He was a longtime director on the prime time series Family Guy, where he was nominated for an Annie Award in 2005. He left the series to create Phineas and Ferb with Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh. Povenmire has been nominated for several awards for his work on the show, including a BAFTA, an Annie, and an Emmy Award. As of 2015, he and Marsh are currently producing a new series for Disney XD titled Milo Murphy's Law, which premiered on October 3, 2016."
