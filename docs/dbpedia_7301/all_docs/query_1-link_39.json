        "text": "This is a list of the 109 cartoons of the Popeye the Sailor film series produced by Fleischer Studios for Paramount Pictures from 1933 to 1942.[1]\n\nDuring the course of production in 1941, Paramount assumed control of the Fleischer studio, removing founders Max and Dave Fleischer from control of the studio and renaming the organization Famous Studios by 1942. Popeye cartoons continued production under Famous Studios following 1942's Baby Wants a Bottleship.\n\nAll cartoons are one reel (6 to 10 minutes long) and in black and white, except for the three Popeye Color Specials (Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor from 1936, Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Thieves from 1937, and Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp from 1939), which are two reels (15 to 20 minutes long) and in Technicolor."
