Shamus Culhane (of Irish and French descent) attested that it was sooooo mixed and comically relaxed that they jokingly would refer to each other with what would now be termed 'racial pejoratives'... The Hebrew gags were indeed most likely from either Dave Fleischer himself or possibly Seymour Kneitel amongst others...\n\nAt Harman-Ising the Hebrew script and Jewish gags are easily attributable to Friz (who was Jewish). At least one also occurs in a Tashlin toon as well.\n\nDisney had some Jewish people on staff but the nature of the studio (all things being created by a group then passing through Walt, up through the mid-Forties) made for toons that were much more homogenized. When the staff was much, much smaller the toons were not as you would say \"WASPY\"...\n\nOriginally posted by frogboxer\n\nI didn't know that Friz was Jewish. I wonder if this has anything to do with why so many folks nowadays think that Bugs was a Jewish stereotype.\n\nWhy is it that back in those days, people of different ethnicities could not only that at themselves but at each other, and not so many people got offended?\n\nI know Friz could be a Jewish name, because it sounds like it is!\n\nTim, thanks for the extra info. I could've guessed that the Fleischer's staff had to be a pretty mad bunch to work with. Reminds me of a couple who affectionately called each other a \"dumb wop\" and a \"stupid hillbilly\"!\n\nI suppose the ethnic stuff that pops up in their work is kinda like \"taggers\" who get their kicks by leaving their mark in odd places with a Sharpie or spray paint.\n\nIsadore is (or was) a pretty common name for jewish boys in those days. I figured Isadore Freleng or I. Freleng or Friz Freleng, as he's named in credits thru the years, probably was one. I would've loved to work under him. I think he directed more different characters than any other director in animation history.\n\nDave.\n\nFreleng wasn't the only Jewish man in animation who concealed his first name of Isidore. There was also Izzy Ellis, who animated for Clampett in the thirties, and Tashlin and McKimson in the forties; Isidore Klein, longtime writer for Terry and Famous; and Isidore Sparber, longtime Fleischer/Famous director. At the time it was not unusual to hide ones' Jewish identity by changing ones first name to make it seem less 'ethnic'- or just using a first initial. Or, because many people might've mistaken Isidore for a woman's name.\n\nWB initially used directors' given first names on credits- hence Fred Avery, Robert Clampett, Arthur Davis Charles M. Jones and I. Freleng, instead of the nicknames they're popularly known for. It wasn't until the studio reopened after the 1954-55 shutdown that you started to see 'Chuck' and 'Friz'. Other studios were much less formal; MGM credited Tex Avery right at the start with THE BLITZ WOLF.\n\nFleischer cartoons probably contained the most 'ethnic' Noo Yawk humor by virtue of his multi-ethnic East Coast staff, but WB had its share of 'Jewish' gags:\n\n-NOW THAT SUMMER IS GONE: the Kosher nuts.\n\n-WALKY TALKY HAWKY: \"Oooy, that's the biggest chicken ever I did see!\"\n\n-REALLY SCENT: \"Oy vey, what a day!\"\n\n-CANNERY WOE: A Mexican mouse caps off a long Spanglish rant with \"Oy, gayvalt !\"\n\nMany cartoons had a character saying, with the appropriate lilt, \"You were expecting maybe-?\", which was based on a period radio catchphrase whose identity currently eludes me.\n\nLet's not forget that in addition to Friz, master WB voice Mel Blanc was Jewish. Some say director Art Davis was as well. So were producers Schlesinger and Selzer, but they really played no part creatively.\n\nAs long as we're on the subject, Happy Hanukkah!\n\nFriz was not actually concealing his name per se, just the darn nickname was so descriptive early on that it stuck like glue even though Warners insisted on a no-nickname-on-screen policy, hence the 19 years of \"I.\". He of course originally had a big mane of frizzy red hair (which he started losing very young). In the few early pictures that survive of him he bears a fair resemblance to (of all folks) the young Don Knotts!! Friz was indeed Jewish but his father HATED New York (sorry New Yorkers) and moved to Missouri. There from what I know of it \"Isadore\" was raised in a semi-small-town environment and went to school with people like Hugh Harman.\n\nIsadore Klein of course insisted on always billing himself as \"I. Klein\" wherever he worked. He was also fleetingly at Mintz/Columbia as an uncredited soul. And from there was hired at Disney and returned to animation on \"Mother Goose Goes Hollywood\" alongside Grim Natwick.\n\nI. Ellis of course at Warners was not allowed to put \"Izzy\" on screen. However he started having himself billed as \"Izzy Ellis\" when he began doing TV animation. (Maybe he thought it was time to quit abbreviating his name, or maybe he was trying to protect his earlier career in theatrical animation ). He also had been repeatedly borrowed from the Tashlin unit by Bob Clampett, making it very hard to know which cartoons he really worked on.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the non-artist of the \"I\" gang, Izzy Sparber, who came out of Max Fleischer's camera and then story department to become one of the two main directors for Famous Studios. Culhane downplays Sparber's directors credits, all but saying he was a non-artist; however, as I've said in the other Popeye threads, if you look at the freedom he allowed his writers and head animations in his mid-1940s cartoons (especially Jim Tyer on the directing side and people like Otto Mesmer on the writing side), he comes off as the direcotial equivalent of that hand-off west coaster, Leon Schlesniger, who let more talented people take chances in their cartoons. (Unfortunately, Seymour Kneitel apparently was the more dominant personality in terms of deciding the studio's direction as the 40s wore on, and it became harder to differentiate head animator or writers styles by the 1950s).\n\nPlus, anyone who could live in New York in 1958 and green-light \"Chew Chew Baby\" deserves mention somewhere in this thread..."
