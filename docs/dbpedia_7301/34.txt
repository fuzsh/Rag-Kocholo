Isadore Sparber was an American storyboard artist, writer, director and producer of animated films. He is best known for his work with Fleischer Studios and its successor, Famous Studios. His work (when credited) appeared with different versions of his name including Izzy Sparber, I. Sparber, Irving Sparber, Isadore Sparber and Isidore Sparber.

Sparber worked for Fleischer Studios in the 1930's and 1940's where much of his early work was uncredited. However, he was credited as a writer for several Betty Boop and Superman cartoons, as well as the feature length films Gulliver's Travels and Mr. Bug Goes to Town.

When Paramount Pictures took over Fleischer Studios in 1941, Sparber and Seymour Kneitel were named as the new heads of the renamed Famous Studios. Sparber was credited as the director and/or producer of many cartoons produced by Famous Studios between 1941 and 1958.

Sparber died August 28, 1958 in New York City.

This may have been a factor in Paramount's 1959 decision to discontinue production of several cartoon series and sell the rights to Harvey Comics.
