Hello, all. I've been a long time lurker to this forum and previously a GAC member.

One of the things I have always found strange is that all of the Isadores that worked in animation almost always had their names shortened to just "I.". Four of Izzys come to mind, Isadore Freleng and Isadore Ellis mostly credited for Warners and Isadore Sparber and Isadore Klein mostly credited for Famous Studios.

Was there any kind of aversion to the name Isadore which kept it from being added to the credits? The only plausible reason I could think of was that the name is a tad long, but it really isn't as it's the same length as a Charles, William or Richard, names which regularly appeared in credits of said studios, even though it does have an extra syllable. Also, you can't assume I. stands for Isadore as there are Irvings out there, for instance.

When I was a kid, I even thought that I. Freleng and Friz Freleng were two different directors for this reason. Interestingly enough, Freleng was credited as Isadore on WB cartoons up until 1935, while his full name can also be seen on Captain and the Kids cartoons by MGM. Sparber was credited as both I. and Isadore or Isidore for his writing work on the Superman shorts by Fleischer, but was always I. for his directorial work.

Does anyone have any knowledge about this curiosity?
