        "text": "The research presented herein encompassed analysis of prehistoric graves from the necropolis of the Velika Mrdakovica Hillfort in the vicinity of Zaton, near Šibenik. These are five graves from the earliest period of burials, from the Early Iron Age. Their analysis and synthesis will serve as the point of departure for fuller insight into the long, rich and fluctuating history experienced by its inhabitants and inheritors. Based on the types of burials, the graves generally comply with rites typical of the Šibenik region and the central Adriatic coastal belt. However, the placement of the bodies fully extended deviated from the overriding practices in this core territory of the Liburnians. Most of the gathered physical cultural materials consist of personal attire items and jewellery of the deceased, which have been ascribed to the Liburnian culture in the broader sense of typological classification. In line with their previous cultural interpretation, they have been separated into men’s and women’s attire, wherein the finds of pins and fibulae, as well as ring-shaped jewellery and amber beads, are the most prominent. From the chronological standpoint, two general burial periods have been distinguished in their interpretation. Typical of the older graves is the large fibula with amber bead on the bow, while the younger graves are characterized by the predominance of the proto-Certosa fibula with a small globule at the end of the foot. Despite double or multiple interments, the materials indicate a certain chronological framework, which suggests simultaneous or very brief subsequent interments, interpreted in the sense of narrower familial graves. Synchronized with the Liburnian culture periodization, interments in the older graves proceeded in the II. A and B phases, while the younger ones proceeded from the end of cultural phase III and in phase IV according to the classical periodization scheme. In compliance with the typological-chronological analysis of the materials in comparison to coterminous phenomena in the Adriatic basin cultures, a revised relative and higher absolute chronological scheme for the Liburnian sphere are proposed in the synthesis.\n\nThe article presents materials of the late Eneolithic cemetery related to the Cernavodă I culture. The cemetery is part of a very extensive archaeological complex with the name Kartal located in the vicinity of the village of Orlovka (the Reni district, the Odessa county) on the Lower Danube. About 40 late Eneolithic graves were uncovered in the cemetery for several years of excavations. The graves are represented by inhumations in oval and rectangular pits. The deceased are buried in a crouched position on the left side or on the back. Grave goods are quite rare and usually include single vessels. Burial rite in the cemetery has clear parallels in mortuary traditions of the Cernavodă I culture in the Balkans and steppe Eneolithic graves in the NorthWest Pontic region.\n\nArchaeological excavations, carried out since 1998 by the Institute of Archaeology in Stari Grad in the centre of Ivanec, have established long-term human presence at the site, from prehistoric and Roman times to the middle of the 20th century. Among other things excavated in the courtyard of the local Renaissance and Baroque fort were a Romanesque and a Gothic church where burials continued into the 17th century. During the 1998 campaign, a fragment of a Roman tombstone, made from local limestone and decorated with human figures carved in relief on the front and side surfaces, was found as a spolium in the walls of the Gothic church. This text publishes the find for the first time and provides a comprehensive analysis of its iconography, formal typology, dating and the social circumstances in which it came into being. Although, due to its incompleteness, the original appearance of the tombstone remains unknown, we presume it was a corner stone of a tomb or a so-called grave pillar (Grabpfeiler), and date it back to the 3rd century. Along with other items (ceramics, brick, bone, glass), this find provides our first evidence of a Roman settlement on the territory of Ivanec. / U arheološkim istraživanjima koje Institut za arheologiju od 1998. provodi na Starome gradu u središtu Ivanca, utvrđena je dugotrajna naseljenost tog lokaliteta od prapovijesnog i rimskog razdoblja do polovine 20. stoljeća. U dvorištu tamošnjeg renesansno-baroknog kaštela istražene su, između ostalog, romanička i gotička crkva s kontinuitetom ukapanja do u 17. stoljeće. U kampanji 1998., u zidovima gotičke crkve kao spolij je zatečen ulomak rimskog grobnog spomenika načinjenog od lokalnog vapnenca, ukrašenog reljefnim ljudskim likovima na prednjoj i bočnoj plohi. U ovome radu taj se nalaz objavljuje po prvi put i obrađuje cjelovito s obzirom na ikonografiju i formalnu tipologiju te datiranje i društvene okolnosti nastanka. S obzirom na necjelovitost, izvorni izgled spomenika ostaje nepoznat, ali se on pretpostavljeno rekonstruira kao ugaoni blok grobne građevine ili tzv. grobnog stupa (Grabpfeiler) te se datira u 3. stoljeće. Zajedno s drugim predmetima (keramika, opeka, kost, staklo), taj je nalaz prvo svjedočanstvo o rimskodobnom naselju na području Ivanca."
