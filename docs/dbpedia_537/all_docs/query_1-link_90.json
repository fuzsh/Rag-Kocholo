        "text": "Criterion B: Distribution and Abundance\n\nSub-criterion B1: Small and Resident Populations\n\nThe east coast of the UK contains a large proportion of the habitat and area consistently occupied by a discrete and resident population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) for which photo-ID data have been collected since 1989 (Arso Civil et al 2019; Cheney et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2017). Based on data from 2015 to 2019 the weighted mean population size is 224 (95% CI 214-234) individuals, and data show the population is increasing (Cheney et al., 2018; Arso Civil et al., 2019, 2021). The Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation (SAC) was originally designated in the 1990s to protect this population, but subsequent monitoring efforts demonstrate this spatial delineation no longer captures a high proportion of habitat that the population utilises year-round (Wilson et al., 2004; Culloch & Robinson, 2008; Cheney et al., 2013; Gutiérrez-Muñoz et al., 2021). Photo-ID data demonstrate that this population now extends along the coastal waters between the Moray Firth in Scotland and the Humber in England (Arso Civil et al., 2019; Sea Watch Foundation, 2021; Citizen Fins project, unpublished data). From 2010 there has been a marked increase in records of bottlenose dolphins in eastern England, first in the Northumbrian area and then since 2016, further south in Yorkshire, with occasional sightings even off Norfolk (Evans & Bertulli, 2021).\n\nPassive acoustic monitoring shows inter-annual and seasonal variation in the presence of bottlenose dolphins in parts of the range such as in the Moray Firth SAC, with a peak in presence during summer months but with animals frequently present during most winter months (Cheney et al., 2018). The area is used for breeding and foraging, with calves regularly sighted across the distributional range (Arso Civil et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2017; Cheney et al., 2019; Citizen Fins project, unpublished data). These coastal waters include a number of river estuaries which host year-round or seasonal migrations of prey species which make the mouths of the estuaries high usage areas by bottlenose dolphins for foraging (e.g. Hastie et al., 2004; Bailey et al., 2010).\n\nCriterion C: Key Life Cycle Activities\n\nSub-criterion C1: Reproductive Areas\n\nGrey seals (Halichoerus grypus) breed in various sites along the coast in this area including colonies on the Isle of May (~ 1,900 pups) within the Isle of May SAC, Fast Castle (~4,500 pup) and the Farne Islands ( ~2800 pups) within the Berwickshire and North Northumberland Coast SAC, and Donna Nook (~ 2,200 pups) within the Humber Estuary SAC (Russell et al. 2022). In total around ~14,000 pups are born in this IMMA area annually, which is over 20% and 7% of the UK and world’s grey seal pup production, respectively (SCOS, 2022). This IMMA also encompasses haul out sites for around 1,350 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) (Russell et al. 2022; ~3% UK’s total estimated harbour seal population), and includes breeding and to a lesser extent, foraging areas for this species.\n\nSub-criterion C2: Feeding Areas\n\nThe highly productive waters of the Moray Firth attract above-average densities of common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) relative to adjacent waters (Tetley et al., 2008; Paxton et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2023), with sightings of minke whales occurring primarily inshore in shelf waters less than 200 m deep. A total of 56,263 kms of boat survey effort conducted between 2001 and 2022 resulted in 964 sightings of confirmed age-class common minke whales (471 juveniles and 493 adults; Robinson et al., 2023). Effort-corrected encounter rates of minke whales were higher in offshore waters compared to more coastal waters, with a peak in sightings from July to August, and a progressive inshore movement of animals across the summer and autumn (Robinson and Tetley, 2009). The area provides rich feeding grounds for minke whales during the summer and autumn months (Robinson et al., 2007, 2009; Robinson & Tetley, 2009). Adult whales target larger prey than their juvenile counterparts, with juveniles almost exclusively targeting year 0-1 sandeels, whilst adults demonstrate greater dietary plasticity, with seasonal prey-switching between sandeels (year 0-3), herring and sprat (Robinson et al., 2023). The Southern Trench lies along the southern coastline of the outer Moray Firth, and has been designated as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) for the protection of minke whales (NatureScot, 2020).\n\nThe importance of this area as a feeding ground for minke whales is further supported by sighting distribution and predicted density maps show the waters off Whitby in NE England are important for a number of baleen whale species including minke whales and humpback whales, in late summer and autumn, coinciding with the spawning herring migration in the area (Evans and Bertulli, 2020; Evans and Waggitt 2020; Waggitt et al., 2020).\n\nArso Civil, M., Cheney, B., Quick, N.J., Thompson, P.M. and Hammond, P.S., 2017.
