        "text": "It is a venerable tradition that each faculty of the Ruhr University selects one of its students for the science award of the year. This usually takes place in the Auditorium Maximum as part of a large year’s end celebration. On November 29, 2023, this award was given to Robert Willma. In his master thesis, Robert had meticulously described that pigeons use a pecking code during the delay periods of working memory tasks to not forget the colors that they saw. Thus, the animals use a symbolic motor code for a percept!\n\nRobert, the whole biopsychology lab and the faculty of psychology of the RUB is proud of you!\n\nOn Friday, December 15, 2023, Doro successfully defended her PhD thesis entitled \"The neurogenetic basis of human intelligence - how network connectivity mediates the effect of polygenic scores on intelligence\". Yes, it’s a long title. But it’s also a very complex topic that requires care, hard work and (of course) intelligence. In short, Doro aimed to understand how genes influence intelligence via altering the brain. She discovered that this seems to work mostly by increasing cortical surface area and the efficiency of intracortical wiring. These and many more insights prompted her to formulate a preliminary vision of a new theory for the genetic and neural fundaments of human intelligence. What an achievement!!! The committee members (Dirk Scheele, Sebastian Ocklenburg, Onur Güntürkün, Robert Kumsta) were totally impressed and awarded Doro with a summa cum laude.\n\nCongratulations Doro, we all are very proud of you!!\n\nIt is said that pirates made their victims walk the plank over the side of their ship. Biopsychologists from Bochum, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and Wellington made the same for science. Well, sort of. The aim was to study the neural fundaments of fear. This is usually done by showing pictures with highly negative content, but the effects are often shallow. To improve ecological validity, the scientists now asked the participants to wear virtual reality (VR) systems while walking a real plank. Looking down, they saw that the plank went over the side of an 80 storeys skyscraper. That induced true fear. And indeed, walking the plank induced a higher right hemispheric activation, as expected for fear, than looking at negative pictures. Thus, testing participants under more ecological conditions can uncover mechanisms of the emotional brain.\n\nEl Basbasse, Y., Packheiser, J., Peterburs, J., Maymond, C., Güntürkün, O., Grimshaw, G., Ocklenburg, S., Walk the Plank!

So, we would expect them to have a large prefrontal cortex (PFC). But there seems to be none! At least at the expected place in the frontal cortex. How is that possible? Now biopsychologists and clinical scientists from Bochum as well as veterinary scientists from the university of Padua could solve the mystery. Using MRI, they tracked the fibers ascending from the medio-dorsal thalamic nuclei (MD) to the cortex. In land mammals the MD projects to the PFC. To their surprise, they discovered that these fibers ascended to the lateral frontal cortex. So, possibly dolphins have a large PFC, but since their large brain could not grow even more frontally, their PFC was pushed sideways during evolution. The picture shows a dolphin brain along with the brains of a rat, a pigeon and the model of a human brain.\n\nGerussi, T., Graïc, J-M, Peruffo, A., Behroozi, M., Schlaffke, L., Huggenberger, S., Güntürkün, O., Cozzi, B., The prefrontal cortex of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus Montagu, 1821).

However, this paradigm often produces false-negative results and possibly dichotomizes a gradual evolutionary transition of self-recognition. We hypothesized that this ability is more widespread if ecologically tested and developed such a procedure for a most unlikely candidate: chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). Roosters warn conspecifics when seeing an aerial predator, but not when alone. Exploiting this natural behavior, we tested individual roosters alone, with another male, or with a mirror while a hawk’s silhouette flew above them. Roosters mainly emitted alarm calls in the presence of another individual but not when alone or seeing themselves in the mirror. In contrast, our birds failed the classic mirror test. Thus, chickens possibly recognize their reflection as their own, strikingly showing how much cognition is ecologically embedded.\n\nHere you can find a report by the New York Times.\n\nHillemacher S, Ocklenburg S, Güntürkün O, Tiemann I (2023) Roosters do not warn the bird in the mirror: The cognitive ecology of mirror self-recognition.

Mammalian sleep has been implicated in maintaining a healthy extracellular environment in the brain. During wakefulness, neuronal activity leads to the accumulation of toxic proteins, which the glymphatic system is thought to clear by flushing cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) through the brain. In mice, this process occurs during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In humans, ventricular CSF flow has also been shown to increase during NREM sleep, as visualized using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The link between sleep and CSF flow has not been studied in birds before. Using fMRI of naturally sleeping pigeons, we show that REM sleep, a paradoxical state with wake-like brain activity, is accompanied by the activation of brain regions involved in processing visual information, including optic flow during flight. We further demonstrate that ventricular CSF flow increases during NREM sleep, relative to wakefulness, but drops sharply during REM sleep. Consequently, functions linked to brain activation during REM sleep might come at the expense of waste clearance during NREM sleep.\n\nUngurean, G., Behroozi, M., Böger, L., Helluy, X., Libourel, P., Güntürkün, O. & Rattenborg, N. C. (2023). Wide-spread brain activation and reduced CSF flow during avian REM sleep. Nature Communications, 14(1).\n\nIt might be presumed that due to the presence of two distinct hemispheres, each hemisphere operates autonomously without any interaction with the other. However, it is important to note that the hemispheres continually exchange information through the corpus callosum, a bundle of white matter that connects them.\n\nThe integration of information across the corpus callosum can be influenced by hormones like estradiol and progesterone. The objective of the present study was to examine whether acute stress and its accompanying fluctuations in stress hormone levels impact the transfer of information across the corpus callosum.\n\nFor this purpose, we collected EEG data from 50 participants while completing a lexical decision task and a Poffenberger paradigm twice, once after the administration of 20mg of hydrocortisone and once after a control condition. There were no differences in interhemispheric transfer between the experimental and the control in any of the tasks used to measure information exchange between the hemispheres. This suggests that increases in cortisol levels alone are not sufficient to affect interhemispheric interaction through the corpus callosum.\n\nBerretz G, Packheiser J, Wolf OT and Ocklenburg S (2023) A single dose of hydrocortisone does not alter interhemispheric transfer of information or transcallosal integration.

Just like in mammals, these spatial functions rely heavily on the integrity of the hippocampus (HC). Interestingly, recent studies reporting place cells and sharp wave ripples in birds find physiological differences between dorsomedial and ventrolateral hippocampal regions, suggesting a laminar organization along the transverse axis that seemingly stands in contrast to the non-laminar appearance of the avian HC. Here, we investigated the intrinsic connectivity of the pigeon HC especially with respect to this potential segregation of subdivisions. Using in vivo and high-resolution in vitro tracings, as well as by analyzing the neurochemical profile, we indeed identified two distinct processing streams along the avian hippocampal transverse axis that might have different functional specializations. Overall, our study suggests that the avian HC contains a complex intrinsic network suitable to sustain and modulate incoming neural activity by a recurrent neural network.\n\nRook, N., Stacho, M., Schwarz, A., Bingman, V.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that thousands of alleles contribute to variation in intelligence with small effect sizes. Polygenic scores (PGS) can be used to combine these effects into one genetic summary measure. With PGS it is possible to investigate genetic predispositions in smaller, independent samples. While the genetic association of PGS with intelligence have been shown multiple times, it is largely unknown how brain structure and function are working as a neurobiological pathway behind these genetic effects. Here, we show that individuals with higher PGS for educational attainment and intelligence had higher scores on cognitive tests, larger surface area, and more efficient fiber connectivity derived by graph theory. Efficiency of fiber connectivity means that brains are organized in a way that information can easily be passed from one brain area to another with relatively energy needed. Fiber network efficiency as well as the surface of brain areas partly located in parieto-frontal regions were found to mediate the relationship between PGS and cognitive performance. Thus, genes associated with intelligence shape surface area and fiber network efficiency of our brain and these properties then in turn facilitate our intelligent thinking. These findings are a crucial step forward in decoding the neurogenetic underpinnings of intelligence, as they identify specific regional networks that link polygenic predisposition to intelligence.\n\nGenç, E., Metzen, D., Fraenz, C., Schlüter, C., Voelkle, M.

Only a few species have up to now passed a standard mark-and-mirror test in which animals attempt to touch a mark that can only be seen in the mirror. Mirror self-recognition has also been claimed for bottlenose dolphins but this initial work is highly contested. The problem is: “How do test an animal that cannot touch the mark because it has no arms?” To solve this problem, experts of dolphin behavior in St. Andrews, Nuremberg, and Bochum invented a new procedure in which they marked the areas around both eyes of the animals at the same time, one with visible and the other with transparent dye to control for haptic cues. This allowed the animal to see the mark easily and the scientists to investigate what side the animal looked at when being confronted with a mirror. They found that the animals actively chose to inspect their visibly marked side while they did not show an increased interest in a marked conspecific in the pool. These results make it likely that dolphins can differentiate between self and others.\n\nLoth, A., Güntürkün, O., von Fersen, L., Janik, V. M., Through the looking glass: how do marked dolphins use mirrors and what does it mean? Animal Cogn., 2022, 25: 1151-1160.\n\nOn May 17, 2023, the raw construction of THINK was finalized and a very nice topping out ceremony took place. Politicians from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the city of Bochum as well as representatives of the building agency and our university gave short congratulation addresses. Onur shortly recapitulated the history of THINK and stressed the collaborative effort of many people who made THINK possible. THINK is 100 meters long and 45 meters wide, the floor space is 4,000m2 of which more than half is laboratory space, the four-story building is naturally lit via an inner courtyard, and the high-resolution human and small-animal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners required an unusual structural design in which the equipment foundations under the MRIs are decoupled from the foundations of the rest of the building.\n\nOne major survival-related activity of organisms is to seek food in their environment. To this end, they exploit previously rewarding locations and attempt to approach the cues predictive of the edible items they detect or expect. But foraging is unlikely to be a matter of reinforcement only. If it was, however, foraging activity should follow principles of extinction learning: It should be abolished in a location without reinforcement and proportionally be reduced in a partially reinforced location relative to a fully reinforced one containing the same number of food items. We tested these two hypotheses using a foraging board, which allowed pigeons to find food items hidden in perforated holes. Our results showed that the overall time spent and the overall number of pecks given in one area was related to reinforcement density in that area. To a lesser extent, the same phenomenon occurred with respect to the number of visits per area. However, the time-per-visit and pecks-per-visit ratios were higher in the partially vs. fully reinforced area, suggesting that the pigeons foraged more than expected when food was uncertain. These results will be discussed in the context of the matching law and optimal foraging.\n\nAnselme, P., Wittek, N., Oeksuez, F., Güntürkün, O. (2022). Overmatching under food uncertainty in foraging pigeons. Behavioural Processes, 201, 104728. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2022.104728\n\nNeuroticism is a personality trait that is associated with high levels of anxiety, anger, and loneliness. Biopsychologists in Bochum have now discovered a link between the cellular microstructure of the amygdala and neuroticism. Brain images from 221 healthy participants were acquired using advanced multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging and the amygdala was segmented into its eight subnuclei. Lower neurite density in the lateral amygdala nucleus (LA) was significantly associated with higher scores in depression, one of the six neuroticism facets. The La is the sensory relay of the amygdala, filtering incoming information based on previous experiences. Reduced neurite density and related changes in the dendritic structure of the LA could impair its filtering function, causing harmless sensory information to be misevaluated as threatening and thus increase neuroticism-related behavior.\n\nSchlüter, C., Fraenz, C., Friedrich, P., Güntürkün, O. and Genç, E., Neurite density imaging in amygdala nuclei reveals interindividual differences in neuroticism. Human Brain Mapping, 2022, 1–13 https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25775.\n\nEach half of the brain is specialized for processing different tasks. The left hemisphere is more strongly involved in language processing while the right hemisphere is dominant for face perception. For example, frontal asymmetries measured with EEG have been linked to both emotional processing in healthy individuals and affective disorders like depression. Stress provides a particularly strong source of negative emotion and has also been related to the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate how acute stress affects frontal EEG asymmetries. For this purpose, continuous EEG data were acquired from 51 healthy adult participants during stress induction with the Trier Social Stress Test. In addition, EEG data were also collected during a non-stressful control condition. Furthermore, EEG resting state data were acquired after both of these conditions. In the stress condition, participants showed stronger left hemispheric activation over frontal electrode sites as well as reduced left-hemispheric activation over occipital electrode sites compared to the non-stressful control condition. There were no stress-related changes in the subsequently recorded resting state data. Our results are in line with predictions of the asymmetric inhibition model, which postulates that the left prefrontal cortex inhibits negative distractors, like the negative emotions resulting from acute stress. Moreover, the results support the capability model of emotional regulation, which states that frontal asymmetries during emotional challenge are more pronounced compared to asymmetries during rest conditions. These models suggest that left frontal activity could be indicative of stronger emotion regulation, which is more pronounced during emotional challenge.\n\nBerretz, G., Packheiser, J., Wolf, O. T., & Ocklenburg, S. (2022). Acute stress increases left hemispheric activity measured via changes in frontal alpha asymmetries. iScience, 103841. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.103841\n\nIn August 2021, our PhD student John Tuff visited the lab of Prof Michael Brecht at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin as part of his Max Planck School of Cognition PhD program. In this time, he and the team from Berlin investigated the trigeminal system of the elephant brain and compared it with other sensory nerves as well as the spinal cord. They found the trigeminal ganglia to be huge, larger than a macaque monkey brain, and the maxillary branches, which lead down to the trunk, were thicker than the spinal cord, indicating that the connections to the trunk are more substantial than the nerves to the rest of the body. The infraorbital nerve, which runs through the trunk, was several times as thick as other sensory nerves. These findings suggest that while elephants are mainly known for their excellent sense of hearing, it is possibly underestimated how much these animals rely on their trunks for sensory input.\n\nPurkart, L., Tuff, J.

However, brain structures responsible for visual processing greatly differ between birds and mammals. Here, we examined whether a similar hierarchical organization that operates for processing faces in monkeys also exists in the avian visual system. While pigeons viewed images of faces, scrambled controls, and sine gratings, single neurons were recorded from three visual forebrain regions: the Wulst, the entopallium (ENTO) and mesopallium ventrolaterale (MVL). A greater proportion of single MVL neurons fired to the stimuli, and the population response of MVL neurons distinguished between stimuli with greater capacity than ENTO and Wulst neurons. In contrast to the primate system, no neurons were strongly face-selective and some responded best to the scrambled images. These findings suggest that MVL is primarily involved in processing local features of images, much like the early visual cortex.\n\nClark, W., Chilcott, M., Azizi, A., Pusch, R., Perry, K. & Colombo, M. (2022) Neurons in the pigeon visual network discriminate between faces, scrambled faces, and sine grating images.

Although categorization represents a core cognitive function, stimulus features that drive behavior and underlying strategies for categorizing objects often remain elusive. To elucidate these issues, we performed behavioral experiments with pigeons - classic model animals to investigate perceptual categorization. We generated two categories of artificial stimuli called digital embryos and analyzed the pigeons pecking behavior using machine learning. Our results show that pecking is indicative of the upcoming choice and thus related to features of interest. However, individual animals use different stimulus aspects to base their decision on. By using defined artificial stimuli in addition with a detailed analysis of the pecking behavior, our study paves the way to pinpoint stimulus features as well as individual strategies to solve the task.\n\nPusch, R., Packheiser, J., Koenen, C.

In these studies, he discovered some core principles with which the two hemispheres interact with each other through the commissura anterior under conditions of conflicting information. In a further study he solved the puzzle why pigeons can’t recognize themselves in the mirror, but can use a mirror as a tool to peek into corners that they can’t see directly. The solution for this last mystery was simple: They can’t. Instead, their nearly panoramic sight of view enables them to detect food even in areas close to their back. The committee was very happy with his achievements and was convinced that Emre fully deserves to be awarded a PhD.\n\nCongratulations Emre! We all are very proud of you!\n\nNeslihan’s PhD experiments are a highly innovative and technically advanced series of studies that go all the way through visual perception, action, and cognition in birds. To this end, Neslihan developed novel technical approaches to gain deep insights into diverse aspects of avian cognitive neuroscience. Two major insights stand out among many further ones. First, Neslihan discovered that the process of decision making in pigeons strongly resembles evidence accumulation curves known from mammals. Thus, this core sensory computation seems to be identical since 315 million years of separate evolution. Second, pigeons do not recognize themselves in the mirror but also don’t take their mirror image as another pigeon. Instead, for them the guy in the mirror seems to be an uncanny individual. The committee, consisting of Thomas Bugnyar, Jonas Rose, Giorgio Vallortigara, and Onur Güntürkün was highly impressed by these achievements and were convinced that she fully deserves to be awarded a PhD.\n\nCongratulations Neslihan! We all are very proud of you!\n\nChronic stress has been shown to have long-term effects on natural differences in function between the left and right hemisphere – so called functional hemispheric asymmetries (FHAs). The short-term effects of acute stress exposure on functional hemispheric asymmetries are less well investigated. It has been suggested that acute stress can affect FHAs by affecting the corpus callosum, the white matter pathway that connects the two hemispheres. On the molecular level, this modulation may be caused by a stress-related increase in cortisol, a major stress hormone. Therefore, a team from the biopsychology, the cognitive psychology and the department of neurology from the RUB set out to investigate the acute effects of cortisol on FHAs. Overall, 60 participants were tested after administration of 20 mg hydrocortisone or a placebo tablet in a cross-over design: participants performed a verbal and an emotional dichotic listening task to assess language and emotional lateralization respectively, as well as a Banich–Belger task to assess interhemispheric integration both times. Lateralization quotients were determined for both reaction times and correctly identified syllables in both dichotic listening tasks. In the Banich–Belger task, across-field advantages were determined to quantify interhemispheric integration. While we could replicate previously reported findings for these tasks in the placebo session, we could not detect any differences in asymmetry between hydrocortisone and placebo treatment. This partially corroborates the results of a previous study we performed using social stress to induce cortisol increases. This suggests that an increase in cortisol does not influence dichotic listening performance on a behavioral level.\n\nBerretz, G., Packheiser, J., Höffken, O., Wolf, O. T., & Ocklenburg, S. (2021). Dichotic listening performance and interhemispheric integration after administration of hydrocortisone. Scientific Reports, 11(1), 1-11. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00896-1\n\nOne could think that, since we have two separate hemispheres, each hemisphere works independently of the other. To a certain extent, this is true: Functional hemispheric asymmetries emerge as the left and the right hemisphere are dominant for different aspects of task processing. However, the hemispheres constantly share information through the corpus callosum, the white matter connecting between them. The integration of information across the corpus callosum is dependent on its structural integrity and functionality. Several hormones, like estradiol and progesterone, can influence this function. Since earlier work has demonstrated that long-term changes in stress hormone levels are accompanied by changes in hemispheric asymmetries in several mental disorders, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether acute stress and the associated changes in stress hormone levels also affect information transfer across the corpus callosum. For this purpose, researchers from the biopsychology and the cognitive psychology of the Ruhr University Bochum collected EEG data from 51 participants while completing a lexical decision task and a Poffenberger paradigm twice, once after stress induction with the Trier Social Stress Test and once after a control-condition. While there were no differences in interhemispheric transfer between the stress and the non-stress condition in the Poffenberger paradigm, we observed shorter latencies to stimuli in the left visual field in the left hemisphere at the CP3-CP4 electrode pair after stress. These electrodes are positioned over the brain area that is involved in lexical processing. This suggest that the transfer of lexical material from the right to the left hemisphere was quicker under stress indicative of more efficient signal transfer across the corpus callosum between language related areas.\n\nBerretz, G., Packheiser, J., Wolf, O. T., & Ocklenburg, S. (2021). Improved interhemispheric connectivity after stress during lexical decision making. Behavioural Brain Research, 113648. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113648\n\nFrontal asymmetries during rest is one of the most widely investigated forms of hemispheric asymmetries. It is often assessed by measuring asymmetry in EEG resting-state alpha activation. Alpha asymmetries have been associated with important psychological outcomes like wellbeing, depression and motivation. However, studies on the reliability of alpha asymmetries are sparse and often consist of small sample sizes. In our study, we investigate short-term reliability of frontal and parietal alpha asymmetry in a large sample of 370 participants. We find that both frontal and parietal alpha asymmetry show a good reliability, especially when eyes are closed during the resting state recording. We also find, that reliability differs between recording sites, with frontomedial electrodes showing lower reliability than frontlateral and parietal sites.\n\nMetzen, D.; Genc, E.; Getzmann, S.; Larra, M.; Wascher, E. & Ocklenburg, S.

Thus, proper decision-making is fundamental for survival. Studies in primates and rodents revealed a stochastic perceptual evidence accumulation process during decision-making. What about birds? The present study investigated whether perceptual decision-making in pigeons shows behavioral and computational dynamics comparable to those in mammals and rodents. Using a novel \"pigeon helmet\" with liquid shutter displays that control visual input to individual eyes/hemispheres with precise timing, we revealed highly similar perceptual decision-making dynamics. Thus, both mammals and birds seem to share this core cognitive process that possibly represents a fundamental constituent of decision-making throughout vertebrates. We additionally discovered that avian hemispheres start independent sensory accumulation processes without any major interhemispheric exchange under conditions of time pressure.\n\nWittek, N., Matsui, H., Behroozi, M., Otto, T., Wittek, K., SarÄ±, N., Stoecker, S., Letzner, S., Choudhary, V., Peterburs, J., & Güntürkün, O.

Bochum-based biopsychologists have now studied couples in more natural conditions. Using electroencephalography (EEG), they recorded the brain activity of romantic couples at home while they cuddled, kissed or talked about happy memories together. The results confirmed the theory that positive emotions are mainly processed in the left half of the brain.\n\nA group led by Dr. Julian Packheiser, Gesa Berretz, Celine Bahr, Lynn Schockenhoff and Professor Sebastian Ocklenburg from the Department of Biopsychology at Ruhr-Universität Bochum describes the results in the journal Scientific Reports, published online on 13 January 2021.\n\nIn previous studies on the neuronal correlates of emotion processing, feelings were usually triggered in subjects by presenting certain images or videos in the laboratory. “It was unclear whether that really reflects how people experience and act out feelings,” says Julian Packheiser. “Ultimately, emotions comprise not only the perception of feelings but also their expression.”\n\nClick here to read the report on the \"Neuroscience News\" page.\n\nPackheiser, J., Berretz, G., Rook, N., Bahr, C., Schockenhoff, L., Güntürkün, O. & Ocklenburg, S.

However, lockdowns and contact restrictions imposed to prevent the virus from further spreading, confront stress researchers in psychology and neuroscience with unique challenges. Experimental paradigms widely used to induce stress typically feature in-person social encounters. Hence, they conflict with COVID-19-related requirements. In order to continue stress research during the pandemic, researchers were forced to adapt established stress protocols. We reviewed the literature concerning trends and perspectives such as virtual reality, pre-recordings and online formats that may be useful to adapt established stress induction paradigms to COVID-19-related requirements. Regarding online formats, for instance, it is well feasible to transfer above-mentioned psychosocial stress induction to online communication software in where participant and investigators can meet without coming to research facilities where they may be set at risk for COVID-19 infection. Importantly, we concluded that some approaches to adapt stress protocols may not only help to continue stress research during COVID-19 but that they will likely stimulate the field far beyond the pandemic. For example, altered procedures may open stress research to new contexts or more diverse participant groups. Moreover, they bear the potential for new experimental manipulations.\n\nPfeifer, L.

And how do answers to this question change our own understanding of consciousness and the relationship between humans and animals? While humans tend to intuitively project their own perception of the world onto other species, we set out to challenge the traditional binary model of mirror self-recognition, which assumes a sharp “cognitive Rubicon” that only a limited number of species seemingly can pass.\n\nEarlier studies had shown that pigeons do not pass the traditional mark test, although they can detect synchronicity between self-and foreign movements. However, it was not clear whether they distinguish between self-movements in a mirror reflection and the movements of a real conspecific and behave accordingly. Thus, we tested pigeons in a non-traditional mirror self-recognition task in which they were forced to feed in front of their mirror reflection or in front of another conspecific. Detailed manual observations and automated analysis revealed that while the foreign pigeon was accepted as a competitor, the mirror image caused more inhibition as the reflection seemingly represented an uncanny individual. These results strengthened the case for a gradualist interpretation of MSR as opposed to the traditional binary model. By failing to succeed in spontaneous MSR tasks while being able to make a difference between their mirror image and unknown conspecific, pigeons belong to an intermediate category.\n\nWittek, N., Matsui, H., Kessel, N., Oeksuez, F., Güntürkün, O., & Anselme, P.

We trained pigeons to receive a food reward (unconditioned stimulus, or UCS) following illumination of a response key (conditioned stimulus, or CS). In Experiment 1, 1 group of pigeons was trained with two 100% predictive CS-UCS associations (reward certainty) and another group with two 25% predictive CS-UCS associations (reward uncertainty) for 12 sessions. In both groups, the 2 CS durations were 8 s. Then, in each group, the duration of 1 CS remained unchanged and that of the other CS was suddenly extended from 8 to 24 s for 6 sessions. In Experiment 2, some experienced individuals (from Experiment 1) and naïve individuals formed 2 groups trained with a 24-s CS throughout for 18 sessions. Our results show that pigeons (a) pecked less at the uncertain than the certain CS, (b) decreased and then increased CS-pecking after extending the CS duration, especially in the certainty condition, (c) were unresponsive to the 24-s CS in the absence of previous experience, and (d) decreased their response rate close to the end of a trial irrespective of the reinforcement condition, CS duration, and amount of training. These results are discussed in relation to several theoretical frameworks.\n\nWittek, N., Wittek, K., Güntürkün, O. & Anselme, P. (2021). Decreased key pecking in response to reward uncertainty and surprising delay extension in pigeons. International Journal of Comparative Psychology, 34, 1-17.\n\nIn Pavlovian autoshaping, sign-tracking responses (lever pressing) to a conditioned stimulus (CS) are usually invigorated under partial reinforcement (PR) compared to continuous reinforcement (CR). This effect, called the PR acquisition effect (PRAE), can be interpreted in terms of increased incentive hope or frustration-induced drive derived from PR training. Incentive hope and frustration have been related to dopaminergic and GABAergic activity, respectively. We examined the within-trial dynamics of sign and goal tracking in rats exposed to 20-s-long lever presentations during autoshaping acquisition under PR vs. CR conditions under the effects of drugs tapping on dopamine and GABA activity. There was no evidence of the PRAE in these results, both groups showing high, stable sign-tracking response rates. However, the pharmacological treatments affected behavior as revealed in within-trial changes. The dopamine D2 receptor agonist pramipexole (0.4 mg/kg) suppressed lever pressing and magazine entries relative to saline controls in a within-subject design, but only in PR animals. The allosteric benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) failed to affect either sign or goal tracking in either CR or PR animals. These results emphasize the roles of dopamine and GABA receptors in autoshaping performance, but remain inconclusive with respect to incentive hope and frustration theories. Some aspects of within-trial changes in sign and goal tracking are consistent with a mixture of reward timing and response competition.\n\nFuentes-Verdugo, E., Pellón, R., Papini, M.R., Torres, C. & Anselme, P.

Psicológica, 42, 85-108.\n\nEveryone feels stress - be it a lecture at university, an interview or a first date. While we know that stress affects the entire information processing path, for example attention, working and long-term memory, there is so far no consensus on how these different situations trigger the same feeling of stress and what happens in the brain.\n\nMany scientists try to answer this question and use different methods to induce stress in their subjects. During this, the participants' brain activity is measured. Given the variety of methods used, the question arises to what extent they are comparable with each other and which brain structures are activated by stress.\n\nIn order to answer this question, we have carried out a systematic summary and analysis of the previously published literature on the subject: In the Activation-Likelihood Estimation Analysis, ALE for short, the coordinates of the activation patterns from all studies are compared during the stress and it is statistically checked how similar the different patterns are. As a result, we get a number of areas of the brain that have shown activation in all studies.\n\nWe found cross-method activation in the insula, the claustrum, the lentiform nucleus and the inferior frontal gyrus, among others.\n\nThe insula is related, among other things, to pain perception, self-perception and social perception. As part of the so-called salience network, it integrates sensory and internal emotional information. In addition, it helps to control the hormonal stress response. The Claustrum is located directly adjacent to the insula. Similar to its neighbor, the Claustrum is also responsible for the integration of various information. It also has a meaning for consciousness. This suggests that under stress, study participants turn their attention inwardly to their emotional processes.\n\nThe inferior frontal gyrus is responsible for semantic and phonological processing as well as working memory. Since many of the procedures involve strenuous mental tasks, his role here is likely to be the processing of these tasks.\n\nOverall, our study shows that most of the methods used to induce stress work well and produce similar results. It also shows that the insula, claustrum and inferior frontal gyrus play a central role in the stress response.\n\nBerretz, G., Packheiser, J., Kumsta, R., Wolf, O. T., & Ocklenburg, S. (2021).

However, to understand how these behaviors are realized within the brain, methods that are able to control cellular activity on a millisecond timescale are essential. This can be achieved with optogenetics, where neurons become light-sensitive through the integration of artificial ion channels and can later be controlled with focused optical stimulation. However, this method relies on the use of viral vectors that have so far never been used in the pigeon brain. Therefore, in our study, we compared the efficiency of three adeno-associated viral vectors and found that AAV1 was the most efficient construct in delivering ChR2 into the primary visual area and various other brain regions of pigeons. We could also verify the light responsiveness of ChR2 expressing cells with electrophysiological recordings and immediate early gene expression. Most importantly, we provided the first proof of principle for optogenetics in behaving pigeons as optical stimulation of the primary visual area decreased pigeons’ grayscale visual discrimination accuracy. With our study we provide a viral strategy that can be used for the functional analysis of brain circuits in pigeons and offers novel opportunities for comparative research.\n\nRook, N., Tuff, J.

Technically speaking, he assumed the title of an “Außerplanmäßiger Professor”. This requires the fulfillment of lots of academic criteria of excellence. In addition, two leading external scientists had to verify that Sebastian could successfully receive a call from their institutions. Their response letters were sparked with words like “a most creative and brilliant experimental scientist”, “at the forefront of research”, “tripled the expectation”, etc. So, it was absolutely clear that Sebastian deserves this title and the committee as well as the rectorate did not hesitate a second.\n\nCongratulations Professor Sebastian Ocklenburg! We all are excited!\n\nOn Friday, the 30th of October 2020, Noemi successfully defended her doctoral thesis on the “Neural Circuits of Multi-Component Behavior in the Avian Brain”. Noemi delivered a fantastic tour through her research by first explaining the omnipresence of what we loosely call “multitasking” in our everyday life. She explained that different kinds of functional organizations of action selection and execution are present under this umbrella term and can be beautifully teased apart by the Stop-Change paradigm. Using this procedure, parallel and serial actions can be disambiguated. However, a major problem remains and blocks the path for causal studies: There is no animal model. The establishment of such an animal model is exactly the aim of Noemi’s thesis. To this end, she established all necessary components to show that pigeons can be perfectly tested as an animal model and can help to tease apart the critical neural components by using molecular imaging and behavioral local pharmacology. As beautiful as all of these achievements are, the crown jewel of her thesis is the subsequent establishment of optogenetics in pigeons. For sure, this achievement will change the landscape. The committee was deeply impressed and awarded this grand work with a magna cum laude.\n\nCongratulations Noemi! We are incredibly proud of you.\n\nLeft – analytical, right – creative: that is a misconception many people still have about the two of the halves of brain. Although this is exaggerated, both hemispheres display differences in task processing – so called functional hemispheric asymmetries (FHAs). These FHAs have been thought to be relatively stable over time; however, past research has shown that FHAs are more plastic than initially thought. As the product of the stress-activated hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, cortisol influences information processing at every level from stimulus perception to decision making and action. To investigate the influence of acute stress on FHAs, a team from the Biopsychology and the Cognitive Psychology lab from the Ruhr University Bochum invited 60 participants to the lab two times to perform three different tasks: a Banich-Belger task, a verbal and an emotional dichotic listening task. One session included a stress induction via the Trier Social Stress Test; the other session included a control procedure. We calculated across-field advantages (AFAs) in the Banich–Belger task and lateralization quotients for reaction times and responses per side in both dichotic listening tasks. There were no significant differences between the stress and control session in the dichotic listening tasks. In contrast, there was evidence for an influence of cortisol and sympathetic activation indicated by salivary alpha amylase changes on AFAs in the Banich–Belger task. This indicates that acute stress and the related increase in cortisol do not influence dichotic listening performance. However, stress does seem to affect interhemispheric integration of information.\n\nBerretz, G., Packheiser, J., Wolf, O.T. et al. Dichotic listening performance and interhemispheric integration after stress exposure. Sci Rep 10, 20804 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77708-5\n\nHemispheric asymmetries represent a fundamental organizational principle of sensory, cognitive, or motor processing in the brains of many animal species. This lateralization is related to left-right differences in the structural organization of neural circuits, but how these asymmetries emerge during ontogeny is still poorly understood. A much discussed issue is the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors. In a current neuroanatomical study, biopsychologists from Bochum therefore investigated how projection asymmetries develop in the visual system of pigeons. Retrograde tracing of the major ascending (tectorotundal) projections in light-exposed and –deprived pigeons indicates that light stimulation during embryonic development leads to a stronger innervation of the left side of the brain. However, light does not enhance stabilization of fibers within the left hemisphere but induces stronger pruning of projections to the less stimulated right hemisphere. These data illustrate how visual input during early development modifies connectivity pattern in both brain halves, which in turn profoundly affects lateralized sensory processing, and ultimately lateralized cognitive processes, decision-making, or behavioral control.\n\nLetzner S, Manns M, Güntürkün O. Light-dependent development of the tectorotundal projection in pigeons. Eur J Neurosci. 2020 Sep;52(6):3561-3571. doi: 10.1111/ejn.14775. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.14775\n\nMost humans demonstrably favor one limb over the other. Most research on limb preferences has been dedicated on handedness and its genetic foundation as well as its association with for example psychiatric disorders or language lateralization. However, humans also usually prefer one foot over the other. In this large-scale meta-analysis featuring over 145000 individuals, a multinational team from Germany, Greece and the UK aimed to conclusively determine (1) the prevalence of left- and right-footedness in the population, (2) the relationship between footedness and handedness and identify (3) moderating factors on footedness such as psychiatric disorders, being an experienced athlete and the individuals’s sex or age. We found that the prevalence of left footedness was 12.10% in the population. 60.1% of leftâhanders were leftâfooted, but only 3.2% of rightâhanders were left âfooted indicating a strong association between handedness and footedness. Furthermore, all above-mentioned moderators had a significant impact on the prevalence of footedness indicating that footedness is determined by both a nature and a nurture component. We hope that this study inspires more research on footedness as this phenotype has been critically understudied in laterality research.\n\nPackheiser, J., Schmitz, J., Berretz, G., Carey, D. P., Paracchini, S., Papadatou-Pastou, M. and Ocklenburg, S.. Four meta-analyses across 164 studies on atypical footedness prevalence ans its relation to handedness. 2020, 10:14501.\n\nHumans display a large number of lateralized behaviors that are immediately visible such as handedness or footedness. These asymmetries are not limited to behavioral actions, but are also manifest in hemispheric lateralization of cognitive functions such as language or emotional processing. It is however unclear to what extent different asymmetries of brain and body correlate with one another. In this study, scientists from Bochum and Dresden investigated a large scale sample of over 1500 individuals with respect to their handedness, footedness and language lateralization using a dichotic listening task. We found almost no evidence that motor asymmetries and language lateralization were associated with one another using continuous lateralization quotients. On the contrary, we even found evidence that there is no link between these variables. These results indicate that previous studies suggesting an association between motor and cognitive hemispheric asymmetries might have overestimated their common biological and genetic basis.\n\nPackheiser, J., Schmitz, J., Arning, L., Beste, C., Güntürkün, O. and Ocklenburg, S.. A large-scale estimate on the relationship between language and motor lateralization. 2020, 10:13027.\n\nLaterality research has come a long way since Pierre Paul Broca discovered differences between the left and right hemisphere in language lateralization. Since then, hemispheric asymmetries have been identified to be a fundamental principle in sensory, cognitive and motor processing alike indicating their paramount role in the information processing stream. In the past decade, neuroscientific research has developed a wide range of new methodological tools that significantly improve scientific insights and the reliability of findings in the field. However, laterality research has not yet embraced some of these new tools available to the community. In this perspective paper, we outline the 10 most outstanding challenges and opportunities in laterality research to us and how to approach each of them in the next decade. These issues encompass (1) the necessity for more meta-research, more representative samples and higher ecological validity to increase reproducibility and external validity, (2) using novel experimental and analysis techniques in both animal and human research and (3) exploring the role of laterality in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders and their treatments. We hope that this paper inspires discussion and more research in the coming 10 years in laterality research to shape the next decade on a solid scientific fundament.\n\nOcklenburg, S., Berretz, G., Packheiser, J. and Friedrich, P. (2020): Laterality 2020: entering the next decade, Laterality, DOI:10.1080/1357650X.2020.1804396\n\nThe ability to learn fundamentally rests on the prediction of events in the environment. If there is a mismatch between one’s expectations and the actual outcome, we are programmed to update our expectations based on reality. This process is known as reward prediction error-based learning and has successfully explained behavior in a large variety of species. On the neural level, the activity pattern of dopamine neurons in the midbrain has been identified to represent these reward prediction errors. However, only little is known about the precise temporal dynamics of reward prediction errors to this day. In our study, we investigated pigeons in an extinction learning paradigm that encompassed acquisition, extinction and a renewal test phase in a single session allowing for the investigation of single unit activity across learning. We found that neurons in the NCL, a structure strongly innervated by midbrain dopamine neurons, encode reward prediction errors both during the extinction phase as well as the renewal test. Gradually, the reward prediction error signal decreased with ongoing learning indicating the increasing match between expectations and reality. Furthermore, the neural signal transitioned from the outcome phase of the experiment to the presentation of the reward predictive cue. This is in line with temporal-difference models of learning. In total, our results show that reward prediction errors change gradually on a trial-by-trial basis during learning. Finally, we could demonstrate that reward prediction errors are truly expectancy-driven as we could elicit these signals without changing the quantity or quality of reward.\n\nPackheiser, J., Donoso, J. R., Cheng, S., Güntürkün, O. and Pusch, R.. Progress in Neurobiology, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2020.101901\n\nVisual categorisation is a useful way of organizing and simplifying incoming information from the envorinment around us. Over the past decade, birds have become a popular non-human animal model for vision due to their highly evolved visual systems and abilities. In this study we recorded neural activity from three pallial brain areas in pigeons: the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), an analogue of mammalian prefrontal cortex; the entopallium (ENTO), an intermediary visual area similar to primate extrastriate cortex; and the mesopallium ventrolaterale (MVL), a higher-order visual area similar to primate higher-order extrastriate cortex, while the birds performed an S+/S− Picasso versus Monet discrimination task. In NCL, we found that activity reflected reward-driven categorisation, with a strong left-hemisphere dominance. In ENTO, we found that activity reflected stimulus-driven categorisation, also with a strong left-hemisphere dominance. Finally, in MVL, we found that activity reflected stimulus-driven categorisation, but no hemispheric differences were apparent. We argue that while NCL and ENTO primarily use reward and stimulus information, respectively, to discriminate Picasso and Monet paintings, both areas are also capable of integrating the other type of information during categorisation. We also argue that MVL functions similarly to ENTO in that it uses stimulus information to discriminate paintings, although not in an identical way. The current study adds some preliminary evidence to previous literature which emphasises visual lateralisation during discrimination learning in pigeons.\n\nAnderson, C., Parra, R. S., Chapman, H., Steinemer, A., Porter, B. and Colombo M.. Pigeon nidopallium caudolaterale, entopallium, and mesopallium ventrolaterale neural responses during categorisation of Monet and Picasso paintings, 2020, 10:15971.\n\nIndividuals trained under partial reinforcement (PR) typically show a greater resistance to extinction than individuals exposed to continuous reinforcement (CR). This phenomenon is referred to as the PR extinction effect (PREE) and is interpreted as a consequence of uncertainty-induced frustration counterconditioning. In this study, we assessed the effects of PR and CR in acquisition and extinction in two strains of rats, the inbred Roman high- and low-avoidance (RHA and RLA, respectively) rats. These two strains mainly differ in the expression of anxiety, the RLA rats showing more anxiety-related behaviors (hence, more sensitive to frustration) than the RHA rats. At a neurobiological level, mild stress is known to elevate corticosterone in RLA rats and dopamine in RHA rats. We tested four groups of rats (RHA/CR, RHA/PR, RLA/CR, and RLA/PR) in two successive acquisition-extinction phases to try to consolidate the behavioral effects. Animals received training in a Pavlovian autoshaping procedure with retractable levers as the conditioned stimulus, food pellets as the unconditioned stimulus, and lever presses as the conditioned response. In Phase 1, we observed a PREE in lever pressing in both strains, but this effect was larger and longer lasting in RHA/PR than in RLA/PR rats. In Phase 2, reacquisition was fast and the PREE persisted in both strains, although the two PR groups no longer differed in lever pressing. The results are discussed in terms of frustration theory and of uncertainty-induced sensitization of dopaminergic neurons.\n\nFuentes-Verdugo, E., Pellón, R., Papini, M.R., Torres, C., Fernández-Teruel, A. & Anselme, P. (2020). Effects of partial reinforcement on autoshaping in inbred Roman high- and low-avoidance rats. Physiology and Behavior, 225, 113111.\n\nThere is a long history of research linking lateralization to cognitive abilities, but so far this association had not been investigated in cats. An international research team from Turkey, Portugal and Germany of which the biopsychology was a part now investigated the association between hemispheric asymmetries and cognitive in cats. To this end, strength and direction of paw preferences in 41 cats were measured using two novel food reaching tasks in which the animals needed to open a lid in order to reach the food reward. The research team found that cats that showed a clear preference for one paw were able to open more lids succesfully than ambilateral animals. Moreover, cats that preferred to interact with the test apparatus with their paw from the beginning, opened more lids than cats the first tried to interact with the test apparatus using their heads. Results also suggested a predictive validity of the first paw usage for general paw usage. It was also shown that the cats' individual paw preferences were stable and task-independent. These results yield further support to the idea that lateralization may enhance cognitive abilities.\n\nIsparta, S., Salgirli Demirbas, Y., Bars, Z., Cinar Kul, B., Güntürkün, O., Ocklenburg, S. and Da Graca Pereira,G.. The relationship between problem-solving ability and laterality in cats. Behav Brain Res. 2020 Aug 5;391:112691.\n\nSilbo Gomero is a Spanish whistled language that is mainly used on the island of Silbo Gomero. It has rarely been investigated neuroscientifically, but a research team from the biopsychology now analyzed lateralization in this unusual language. The research team used a vocal and a whistled dichotic listening task in a sample of 75 healthy Spanish speakers. Both individuals that were able to whistle and to understand Silbo Gomero and a non-whistling control group showed a clear right-ear advantage for vocal dichotic listening. For whistled dichotic listening, the control group did not show any hemispheric asymmetries. In contrast, the whistlers’ group showed a right-ear advantage for whistled stimuli. This right-ear advantage was, however, smaller compared to the right-ear advantage found for vocal dichotic listening. In line with a previous study on language lateralization of whistled Turkish, these findings suggest that whistled language processing is associated with a decrease in left and a relative increase in right hemispheric processing. This shows that bihemispheric processing of whistled language stimuli occurs independent of language.\n\nVillar González, P., Güntürkün, O. & Ocklenburg, S.. Lateralization of Auditory Processing of Silbo Gomero. Symmetry 2020,12, 1183.\n\nA significant aspect of human social interaction revolves around touching another individual. The most common social touch behaviors are embracing, kissing and the cradling of children, all of which have been demonstrated to be lateralized on the population level in humans. Two major theories have been proposed driving this type of laterality, namely via motor preferences or thorugh an emotional bias. In this study, we systematically tested predictions of both theories as participants had to perform all three social interactions with inanimate objects such as dolls or mannequins in neutral, positive or negative emotional situations. We found that biases in kissing and cradling were unaffected by the handedness of the participants. Only embracing laterality was significantly correlated with handedness. Furthermore, we found that lateralization was reduced in emotional compared to neutral conditions indicating that affective states influence the lateralization of human social touch. Overall, these results thus support the notion that lateral biases in social touch are driven by emotive rather than motor biases.\n\nPackheiser, J., Schmitz, J., Metzen, D., Reinke, P., Radtke, F., Friedrich, P., Güntürkün, O., Peterburs, J. & Ocklenburg , S. (2019): Asymmetries in social touch—motor and emotional biases on lateral preferences in embracing, cradling and kissing, Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition.\n\nSince the days of Pavlov, associative learning has become a powerful tool to explain behavior of a large variety of organisms. One of the most prominent models of associative learning is the Rescorla-Wagner model. It assumes that different cues massively compete for associative strength. However, some studies have shown that predictions of the Rescorla-Wagner model fail under certain circumstances. Recently, it has been argued that failures of the model result from the systematic overestimation of the extent of cue competition. In our study, we aimed to test different levels of cue competition using an overexpectation design in which cues are being extinguished despite continuous presentations of reward. In a first experiment, we found no evidence for cue competition. For this reason, an additivity training was introduced into the second experiment to strengthen the level of cue competition. In the second experiment, we were able to demonstrate cue competition, however only to a moderate rather than a massive extent as is predicted by the Rescorla-Wagner model. Overall, these results show that cue competition can be modulated and that its extent indeed seems to be slightly overestimated by the Rescorla-Wagner model.\n\nPackheiser, J., Pusch, R., Stein, C. C., Güntürkün, O., Lachnit, H. & Uengoer, M. (2020). How competitive is cue competition? Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1(11).\n\nThe neural basis of motor asymmetries such as handedness and footedness has been studied widely using both EEG and fMRI studies in humans. However, these studies almost exclusively used both unnatural tasks such as finger tapping and unnatural environments such as an fMRI scanner to identify the underlying biological correlates of motor functions. To overcome these shortcomings, our study investigated handedness and footedness in ecologically valid settings by using a mobile EEG in which participants could freely move around. We then let them perform tasks as described by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire (WFQ), two of the most widespread questionnaires to assess motor asymmetries. Thus, our participants were shooting and throwing balls, balancing on rails and even jumped around while being recorded by an EEG. We found that both alpha and beta oscillations on fronto-central electrodes differed significantly between left- and right-handers as well as left- and right-footers. Furthermore, we could predict the extent of handedness and footedness using the EEG recordings during tasks performed with the left limb. All of these results were unaffected by movement indicating that mobile EEGs provide a powerful tool to study motor asymmetries in the field and can thus give meaningful insights into the neural correlates of real-life behavior.\n\nPackheiser, J., Schmitz, J., Pan Y., El Basbasse, Y., Friedrich, P., Güntürkün, O. and Ocklenburg, S. (2020). Using Mobile EEG to Investigate Alpha and Beta Asymmetries During Hand and Foot Use. Frontiers in Neuroscience, 14 (109).\n\nApproximately 40 years ago, Divac and colleagues first described the analogue to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in birds known as the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL). The NCL is comparable to the PFC as that both are seen as the seat of complex behaviors such as working memory and decision making. The past decades of research also demonstrated striking parallels in the underlying connectivity and physiology. Up until now, the location of the NCL had been described in pigeon only, and we knew close to nothing about the borders of the NCL in other bird species. This is problematic because there is considerable variation in both brain structure and behavioral capacities between different bird species. By visualizing the dopaminergic innervation of the forebrain, which is a hall-mark method to identify both the NCL and the PFC, a team of the Biopsychology lab set out to delineate the NCL in chicken, zebra finch and the carrion crow. They found that whereas the trajectory of the NCL in chicken is very similar to pigeon, the zebra finch and crow show a strikingly different pattern. In these two songbirds, the NCL now spans across the entire back of the forebrain and seems split up in to more distinct sub-units. These findings commensurate to what has been observed in mammals; the PFC in chimpanzees is both larger and more parcellated compared to rats. Thus, this study discloses yet another instance of the remarkable parallel evolution of the executive brain structure in birds and mammals.\n\nvon Eugen, K., Tabrik, S., Güntürkün, O. and Ströckens, F.

But what are the reasons for this greater vulnerability? Do experiences of violence as a child possibly lead to a permanently changed perception of social stimuli? Psychiatrists from Bonn and biopsychologists from Bochum now indeed were able to shed light on basic factors relevant to social dysfunction, interpersonal distance, and responsiveness to touch in adults with a history of childhood abuse. In addition to behavioral testing, structural and functional MRI was performed to assess the neural correlates of social touch in relation to varying degrees of maltreatment. Overall, the findings suggest alterations in neural responsivity to sensory stimulation with both fast and slow touch. Of particular interest was the finding that severe maltreatment was associated with decreased hippocampal responsivity to slow touch, which tends to be associated with the emotion-relevant, comforting aspects of touch. In addition, the scientists also examined social distance by asking participants to approach an unknown person and to stop when the distance was just felt to be pleasant. Indeed, traumatized subjects kept a larger distance by twelve centimeters. These findings upon up new possibilities for body-based therapies of traumatized subjects.\n\nMaier, A., Gieling, C., Heinen-Ludwig, L., Stefan, V., Schulz, J., Güntürkün, O., Stoffel-Wagner, B., Becker, B., Hurlemann, R. and Scheele, D., It still hurts – Childhood maltreatment hampers interpersonal distance and social touch in adulthood, Am. J. Psychiat., 2020, 77: 37–46.\n\nCorvids, parrots and other bird groups demonstrate complex cognition, including causal reasoning, mental flexibility, planning, social cognition and imagination. These cognitive abilities were a surprise to many scientists. They were not expected to be found in birds because of their small brains and the absence of a cerebral cortex. Onur Güntürkün now explains in Scientific American that it is possibly less of interest that both birds and mammals succeeded in growing smart. Rather this accomplishment came about through development of mostly identical neural mechanisms despite differently organized forebrains. Birds and mammals cognitively thrived by increasing neuron numbers. Mammals did so by expanding brain size and birds by amplifying neuron density. They both developed substantially similar networks of “cortical” connections and evolved “prefrontal” areas with identical physiological, neurochemical and functional features. The same can be said for cognition itself. The way birds and mammals learn, remember, forget, err, generalize and make decisions follows identical principles. This astonishing degree of similarity is only possible when nature offers severely limited degrees of freedom in generating neural structures for complex cognition. Birds and mammals evolved similar neural mechanisms and ways of thinking— taking different paths that ended in the same place.\n\nGüntürkün, O., The surprising power of the avian mind, Scientific American, 2020, January, 48-55.\n\nIn healthy humans, the brain shows typical differences between the left and the right hemisphere in structure and function – so-called hemispheric asymmetries. In different psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder however, many asymmetries are reduced. Most of these disorders show a small genetic overlap with each other but none with asymmetry-related genes. A common non-genetic factor among these disorders are changes in the stress system as well as intra- and early life stress. A team from the Biopsychology and the Cognitive Psychology lab from the Ruhr University Bochum now propose a model in which early life stress as well as chronic stress not only increases the risk for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders but also changes structural and functional hemispheric asymmetries. This influence might arise from prenatal effects of maternal stress and early life stress on the stress system and disease development: maternal adversity influences the environment in the womb which in turn programs neural systems underlying cognitive-emotional function. This could also be the case for the development of hemispheric asymmetries. Moreover, pathological changes in the stress system as well as hemispheric asymmetries may lead to further dysregulation in the brain. However, the effect of stress on hemispheric asymmetries could depend on the timing and type of the stressor.\n\nBerretz, G., Wolf, O. T., Güntürkün, & Ocklenburg, S. (2020). Special Issue \"Brain and cognitive asymmetry\": Review. Atypical lateralization in neurodevelopmental and psychatric disorders: What is the role of stress? .\n\nOn Thursday, December 12, 2019, Caro successfully defended her doctoral thesis on “Personality Neuroscience: Biological Basis of Neuroticism and Volition”.\n\nIf one types “Personality Psychology” into a search engine and just opens the first Wikipedia link, the astonishing finding is that this branch of psychology is so remote from neuroscience as hardly any other field of psychological inquiry. As beautifully laid out in Caro’s introduction to her thesis, this is a bit related to the failure of the first grand neuropsychological theory of Eysenck. But it is also a result of serious methodological and conceptual problems. Caro bravely steps into this missing link by focusing on neuroticism and volition. This last point implies also a reach-out into motivation research. In a series of breath-taking studies, Caro then demonstrates links between the dendritic organization of parts of the amygdala and neuroticism, the impact of efficient dopaminergic transmission and the tendency to procrastinate, and correlations between types of action orientation and gender as well as intelligence. Most importantly, she also demonstrates that not only amygdala volume but also the functional connectivity between amygdala and the anterior cingulum is correlated with the tendency of individuals to either start acting or to go on waiting. This last study was published in Psychological Science and became a media bestseller. Each and every of these studies is written by Caro with a profound knowledge of psychology and neuroscience and with the desire to achieve mechanistic explanations. Thus, Caro demonstrates her ability to be a perfect biosychologist.\n\nThe committee consisting of Onur Güntürkün, Nikolai Axmacher, Boris Suchan, and Robert Kumsta was deeply impressed and awarded this great thesis with a magna cum laude. Soon after this success, Caro fulfilled her plan to leave science, but with the promise to hopefully come back.\n\nCongratulations Caro for being such an outstanding biopsychologist! We terribly will miss you.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 4th of December 2019, Steffi successfully defended her doctoral thesis on the “Mechanisms of light-induced neuronal asymmetry during embryonic development” at the IGSN. Most vertebrate brains display neuro-functional asymmetries and we know very little about their ontogeny. Steffi used in her PhD the visual asymmetry of pigeons to study the impact of microRNAs on asymmetry development. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate many downstream biological processes. Although very promising, close to nothing is known about that in pigeons. Despite this challenge, Steffi managed to discover the critical main events in a tour de force of newly established techniques. First, she established from scratch microRNA analysis in our lab and demonstrated that there is no asymmetry in the retina but in the tectum for embryonic expression of the microRNA-183 cluster. To move deeper, she established qPCR and showed that all constituent parts of the microRNA-183 cluster in the right tectum were low when dark, but very high when light incubated. The left tectum evinced only intermediate expression levels after light incubation. Thus, light seems to be needed to induce expression but then primarily activates the not-light exposed right tectum! Puzzling. To solve this, Steffi reconstructed the hottest candidates for the targets of microRNA-183 and found pathways for growth and signal transduction. Then she started to identify with in situ hybridization and laser microdissection the anatomical localization of neurons that are modified by miR-183. Here, she discovered upper and lower tectal cells differ between left and right with respect to the different sub groups of microRNA-183 stained cells. Like Sherlock Holmes, she then puts the puzzle together and puts forward a likely scenario of molecular and cellular events that define the first steps of an asymmetrical brain. The committee consisting of Onur Güntürkün, Carsten Theiß, Giorgio Vallortigara, Thorsten Müller, and Laurenz Wiskott was deeply impressed and awarded this grand work with a summa cum laude.\n\nCongratulations Steffi! We are extremely proud of you.\n\nOn Friday, October 25, 2019, Meng successfully defended her doctoral thesis on the “Neural circuits of appetitive extinction in the pigeon brain”. Extinction learning is a key learning procedure that proceeds with predictable sequences of behavioral changes in all studied vertebrates and invertebrates. But do these similarities of behavior also point to equivalencies of neural mechanisms? This is the core question of Meng’s thesis. She approaches it by behavioral pharmacology and fMRI. In her behavioral studies she probes the contribution of a visual associative structures and can show that it contributes to the processing of the context in learning extinction. This is highly interesting since context memory is in mammals the contribution of the hippocampus. Previous studies could not convincingly show that the pigeon’s hippocampus has a truly visible contribution to memorize the extinction context. Then Meng moves on to study the medial striatum and demonstrates that its contribution is mostly in the realm of the acquisition of extinction, possibly due to insufficient prediction error coding. Finally, she moves on to study for the first time extinction learning in a scanner and yields a huge amount of novel insights on the extinction network. Among these novel information is the finding that the first extinction session is characterized by a broad activation of a large number of forebrain areas. With every further extinction session, however, these activations get smaller and smaller and astonishingly encompass primary visual areas. Based on all these new data, Meng sketches the outline as well as the details of the avian extinction network. She shows that its main outline is similar but not identical to that of mammals. The committee consisting of Onur Güntürkün, Nikolai Axmacher, Martina Manns, and Maik Stüttgen was deeply impressed and awarded this great series of studies with a magna cum laude.\n\nCongratulations Meng! You are fantastic.\n\nOn Thursday, the 24th of October 2019, Christoph successfully defended his doctoral thesis on the “Neural Correlates of Intelligence and General Knowledge Derived by Magnetic Resonance Imaging”. Christoph’s thesis is in many ways unique. While there are several studies on the neural foundations of fluid intelligence, there is practically no such study on the brain fundaments of crystallized intelligence. Christoph’s thesis introduces the reader with a fantastic clarity through the history and present status of the psychology and the neuroscience of intelligence research, to then develop his own way of studying this field. In 324 (yes: 324!) subjects he collects state-of-the-art functional and imaging data and scrutinizes the knowledge base and fluid intelligence of his subjects. He can show that fluid intelligence is equal in both sexes, but that men churn out their fluid intelligence by grey matter volume, while women do it with a highly efficient functional connectivity. For crystallized intelligence, however, women score lower than men, due to differences in structural connectivity. In the next study he uses NODDI to reconstruct the cellular geometry of grey matter and can show that dendritic morphology that derives from efficient synaptic pruning correlates with IQ. This study, that was published in Nature Communications, was among the 0.02% most publicly discussed scientific papers of the last years. Finally, Christoph reconstructs the connectional fundaments of fluid intelligence by the using the functional connectome of the human brain. The committee consisting of Onur Güntürkün, Nikolai Axmacher, Oliver Wolf, and Boris Suchan was deeply impressed and awarded this grand work with a magna cum laude.\n\nCongratulations Christoph! We are very proud of you.\n\nWhat is the only constant in the theory of relativity? Can you name the capital of Sweden? Who wrote \"The Divine Comedy\"? Some individuals are more capable of answering such questions than others. Our knowledge about the world around us makes us who we are, and profound general knowledge can help us navigate through everyday life unerringly. The individual pieces of information constituting our general knowledge are likely to be encoded on a microstructural level, namely within the myriads of synapses of our brain. This gives rise to the question whether interindividual differences in general knowledge can also be related to macrostructural differences in the biological properties of the brain. Now, for the first time, a team of scientists from Bochum and Berlin has examined the neural correlates of general knowledge. They reported their results in \"European Journal of Personality\".\n\nTogether with colleagues from Ruhr University Bochum and Humboldt University Berlin, Dr. Erhan Genç examined the brains of 324 men and women using diffusion tensor imaging. This enabled the scientists to reconstruct the trajectories of nerve fibers in the brain and to gain insight into its structural network. Graph theoretical computations allowed the researchers to assign an individual value to each of the participants' brains reflecting the efficiency of this structural network. In addition to MRI measurements, participants also completed a general knowledge questionnaire developed in Bochum, the so-called Bochumer Wissenstest. This test included more than 300 questions from various fields of general knowledge, such as art and architecture or biology, physics and chemistry. Finally, Dr. Erhan Genç and his colleagues investigated whether the efficiency of the brain's structural network was associated with the amount of general knowledge a person holds.\n\nThe scientists were able to show that individuals with a very efficient fiber network actually had more general knowledge than those with a less efficient network. Importantly, this association was not driven by other factors such as age or sex. Given that general knowledge is likely to be stored in the form of single information fragments scattered across the whole brain, it is conceivable that an efficiently organized network of nerve fibers could provide a beneficial infrastructure for the storage of new information. In the long run, this might foster general knowledge acquisition and lead to higher results in respective test instruments.\n\nGenç, E., Fraenz, C., Schlüter, C., Friedrich, P., Voelkle, M.

In the present study and international team of researchers from Bochum, Turkey and Greece statistically integrated findings on paw preferences in cats and dogs, two species are commonly kept as pets in many societies around the globe. For both species, there were significantly more lateralized than non-lateralized animals. We found that 78% of cats and 68% of dogs showed either left- or right-sided paw preference. Unlike humans, neither dogs nor cats showed a rightward paw preference on the population level. For cats, but not dogs, we found a significant sex difference, with female animals having greater odds of being right-lateralized compared to male animals.\n\nOcklenburg S., Isparta S., Peterburs J. & Papadatou-Pastou M. (2019). Paw preferences in cats and dogs: Meta-analysis, Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition, 24:6, 647-677, DOI: 10.1080/1357650X.2019.1578228\n\nFrom the outside, the human body seems symmetrical. On the inside however, organs are arranged asymmetrically - the heart for example has its seat on the left side in most cases. The development of bodily asymmetries is influenced by the nodal cascade. Here, the gene PCSK6 has shown regulatory function during left-right axis formation by initiating symmetry breakage. However, it is not clear if variation in this gene is also associated with structural asymmetries in the brain. To examine the impact of PCSK6, biopsychologists from the Ruhr-University Bochum analyzed the effects of genetic variation in PCSK6 in a cohort of 320 healthy adults. They linked different PCSK6 variants to the asymmetry in the superior temporal sulcus, a structure involved in voice perception. Heterozygous individuals who carry a short and a long PCSK6 allele showed stronger rightward asymmetry. Further associations were evident in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Here, individuals homozygous for short alleles showed a more pronounced asymmetry. This indicates that PCSK6, a gene that has been implicated in the ontogenesis of bodily asymmetries by regulating the nodal cascade, is also relevant for structural asymmetries in the human brain.\n\nBerretz G., Arning L., Gerding W.M., Friedrich P., Fraenz C., Schlüter C., Epplen J.T., Güntürkün O., Beste C., Genç, E. & Ocklenburg S..

The commission thus follows the advice of the Wissenschaftsrat (Central Science Commission of Germany). THINK was even chosen as the best science building application of 2019 and will be funded with 89 million Euro.\n\nThis new center will be the future core point of research on the neuronal mechanisms of cognition, hybrid cognitive systems, and artificial intelligence in Bochum. It is the first German science building ever that was successfully applied from a speaker from psychology (Onur Güntürkün) and will house ca. 100 scientists who can run within 4,000m2 cutting edge research that span from philosophy of mind to single cell recording, and from technical applications to high field imaging. THINK is planned to be ready in 2024 and will be located on the north edge of the previous Opel car plant.\n\nSome people tend to postpone tasks, although being aware of the adverse effects accompanying procrastination. Our individual ability to tackle tasks directly instead of putting them off is highly dependent on our ability to initiate cognitive-, motivational- and emotional-control mechanisms, so-called metacontrol. Even though individual differences in these metacontrol mechanisms have far-reaching influence our personal and professional life, their genetic foundation is somewhat unknown. Biopsychologists and human geneticists from the Ruhr University Bochum and the University of Technology Dresden joined forces to explore the genetic foundations of interindividual differences in trait-like procrastination, measured as decision-related action control (AOD). The researchers investigated the individual AOD score as well as the genotype of 278 healthy adults. Here they were particularly interested in the tyrosine hydroxylase gene (TH gene). The expression of the TH gene influences the availability of neurotransmitters from the catecholamine family, including dopamine. Since dopaminergic signaling plays a significant role in various metacontrol processes, they aimed to examine whether genetically induced differences in the dopaminergic system are associated with interindividual differences in AOD. The analysis yielded a sex-dependent effect of TH genotype on AOD.\n\nInterestingly, only in women, a genetic predisposition towards higher dopamine levels was associated with poorer action control and therefore the trait-like tendency to procrastinate. Additionally, the research group investigated whether differences in the morphology and functional connectivity of the amygdala that were previously associated with AOD happen to be related to differences in the TH genotype and thus to differences in the dopaminergic system. However, there was no significant amygdala volume or connectivity difference between the TH genotype groups. Therefore, this study is the first to suggest that genetic, anatomical, and functional differences affect trait-like procrastination independently.\n\nSchlüter C., Arning L., Fraenz C., Friedrich P., Pinnow M., Güntürkün O., Beste C., Ocklenburg S. & Genc E..

This lateral preference in infant cradling has been scientifically investigated for 60 years, but influential factors underlying this bias have remained largely unknown due to inconsistent experimental designs and low sample sizes. Luckily, meta-analyses resolve such issues, so we analyzed the entire body of literatur on this topic and generated three major findings on the cradling bias: (1) approximately 69% of all adults prefer to cradle children on the left. (2) Right-handed people have a stronger left-sided preferences than left-handed people. And (3), women have a stronger left-sided preference compared to men. These findings complement recent hypotheses on motor and emotional biases on the laterality of social touch in humans. And if you find yourself holding a baby next time, pay attention to your holding side. It might just tell you something about your feelings!\n\nSchlüter C., Fraenz C., Friedrich P., Pinnow M., Friedrich, P., Güntürkün, O. & Genc E..

Julian’s PhD thesis puts two bold hypotheses forward: First, consolidation of extinction is not required for extinction to occur. Julian was quite cautious to also remark that this is true for behavior analyses and must not necessarily apply for all aspects of neurobiology. Second, key events during extinction are not coded by highly specialized neurons but by cells of mixed-selectivity as they encode a large variety of parameters during an extinction learning paradigm. While the neural responses are highly distributed and diverse on the single unit level, the population response can be decoded into discrete neural archetypes. These and many more findings were pretty impressive. Even more impressive was Julian’s ability to then successfully master 90 minutes of savage grilling by Onur Güntürkün, Nikolai Axmacher, Oliver Wolf, and Jonas Rose. The committee was so impressed that they decided to award Julian’s PhD with a summa cum laude. Congratulations, Julian! We all are very proud of you! During the subsequent photo session three people took in parallel pictures from different locations. The result is funny: everybody looks somewhere else.\n\nProbably, none of us has ever experienced a serious and long-term shortage of food. But in principle evolution has endowed us and other vertebrates with mechanisms that alter our physiology, brain mechanisms, mental states, and behavior when environmental cues signal an upcoming scarcity of food. But what are these mechanisms? Biopsychologists now published a comprehensive theory on the mechanisms of foraging in the top tier theory-journal “Behavioral and Brain Sciences”.\n\nThe theory departs from the observation that both mammals and birds are extremely sensitive to a drop in the probability to find food and reliably react with an invigoration of food-related responses. During such a time these animals consume and/or hoard more food, get fatter, and build up a reserve against future starvation. This even happens when people are anxious to lose their job. In this paper it is argued that an anticipated long-term drop of resources has motivational effects called incentive hope that facilitates foraging effort by an altered release of dopamine - a neurotransmitter strongly involved in inducing incentive motivation. This increases the subjective value of food, promotes higher efforts to collect and consume it, and results in higher bodily or hoarded long-term energy storages. The paper shows that this hypothesis is computationally tenable, leading foragers in an unpredictable environment to search for and to consume more food items. Altogether, this theory bridges the troubled waters between ecology, psychology, and neurobiology. Twenty-three research groups have responded to the call to discuss this novel theory. Their comments are subsequently discussed and integrated into the body of their theory.\n\nAnselme, P. and Güntürkün, O.. How foraging works: Uncertainty magnifies food-seeking motivation, Behav. Brain Sci., Behav. Brain Sci., 2019, 42: e35, 1–59.\n\nAmong functional hemispheric asymmetries in humans, handedness is by far the most investigated. However, the underlying neural correlates remain unclear. Previous research has mainly focused on functional imaging methods and suggests differences in ipsilateral activation during unilateral hand movements between left- and right-handers. As EEG allows for a higher temporal resolution, researchers from the Biopsychology lab adapted the classical Tapley and Bryden task for use during EEG and tested this paradigm in 36 left- and 36 right-handers. Subjects had to click as fast and accurate as possible on eight squares distributed around a fixation cross in a given sequence with varying complexity. The lateralized readiness potential (LRP) is an event related potential component related to asymmetric motor preparation. Increasing complexity of sequences was associated with earlier and less negative LRP peaks. For the last response within a sequence, right-handers had more negative LRP peak amplitudes than left-handers. The effect of handedness on LRP peak amplitude in the first response was modulated by task complexity with a more negative LRP peak amplitude in right-handers than left-handers in simple, but not in medium or complex trials. This effect might be due to more symmetrical processing in right-handers with increasing task complexity, which complements findings from previous imaging studies.\n\nSchmitz J., Packheiser J., Birnkraut T., Hinz N.A., Friedrich P., Güntürkün O., Ocklenburg S.. The neurophysiological correlates of handedness: Insights from the lateralized readiness potential, Behavioural Brain Research, 2019, 364: 114-122.\n\nPost mortem studies have found hemispheric asymmetries in microstructure in several areas of the human brain. However, until recently it was impossible to assess microstructural asymmetries in vivo. In cooperation with the Department of Neurosurgery from Unviersity of New Mexico, a group of researchers from the Biopsychology lab used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to examine microstructural asymmetries in more than 500 participants to determine if findings are in accordance with what has been reported in post mortem studies. Greater left- than right-hemispheric estimated neurite density was found in early auditory, inferior parietal and temporal-parietal-occipital areas. In contrast, greater right-hemispheric neurite density was found in the fusiform and inferior temporal gyrus, reflecting what has been reported in post mortem studies. Microstructural asymmetries were mostly independent from participants’ sex or handedness. These findings suggest substantial microstructural asymmetries in gray matter, making NODDI a promising marker for future genetic and behavioral studies on laterality.\n\nSchmitz J., Fraenz C., Schlüter C., Friedrich P., Jung R.E., Güntürkün O., Genç E. & Ocklenburg S..

Well, you should, because you can infer whether the hug was emotional depending on its laterality. Biopsychologists from Bochum conducted two experiments, one in the laboratory and one in the field, to test (1) if hugs are lateralized on the population level and (2) if the emotional state alters the side preference of hugs in accordance with prevailing theories of emotional lateralization. In both experiments, they found a population level asymmetry in hugs to the right side. This lateralization was associated with motor preferences such as handedness and footedness. However, they also found that the emotional state regardless of positive or negative changed the lateralization of the hug significantly to the left indicating an influence of emotional states on this important social behavior.
