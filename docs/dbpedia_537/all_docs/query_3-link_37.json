If we simply look at the function of citations as persuasive mechanisms we can understand the preoccupation authors had with referring the reader to the original sources. Consider a seventeenth-century reader examining a work upon a contentious theme, for example the historical narration of the rights of the monarchy over the Church. We encounter a description of events that suggests the king's authority is supreme over all other powers both civil and spiritual, and that the Church is simply an appendage of the civil state. This is a view we have always been taught is incorrect. We examine the text: the author has written a 'true' account, following documents and contemporary descriptions to which he has given us directions. We may not be convinced by reasonable argument, but someone declaring 'look this is how it was done, here are the manuscripts to prove it' is less easily dismissed. In this way the reader was led to depend upon the expertise of the historian.\n\n[25] Burnet, Abridgement of the History (1682), Sig. A4r-v.\n\n[26] Burnet, History of the Reformation, 1, Sig. bv. Henry Hickman, Heylyn's redoubtable Presbyterian opponent, had similarly taunted the High Church man with the same charge. Hickman wrote about one of Heylyn's unhelpful references: 'Who these are I know not, nor have any direction to find them out, but a blind one in the margin, v. Synod. Rem. which I am not scholar enough to make use of, if the Synodolia Remonstentium be intended, why is not the page in which those words occur quoted? Can the historian imagine his readers do so <32> abound in leisure, as to read over a Book of so great a bulk, as the Synodolia to find out one phrase?'

Wylie Sypher, 'Similarities between the scientific and historical revolutions at the end of the Renaissance', JHI 26 (1965); see A. Richardson, History, Sacred and Profane (1964), 41, commenting on the Restoration period as 'a kind of twilight period, an age of half seeing, between the fading brilliance of the medieval world system and the dawn of our modern historically minded age'.\n\n[30] See his concluding remarks: 'It is the contention of this writer that some English Church historians of the later seventeenth century showed increasing awareness of the difficulty of the problem of bias and adjusted their methodology in an attempt to solve or at least reduce the problem. In doing so they disclosed attitudes towards historiography that foreshadowed some nineteenth-century developments, and in stressing the importance of sources, they anticipated contemporary practices in historical writing'.

Ferguson, Clio Unbound (North Carolina, 1974), xv, 2, 83. Note G. R. Elton's hostility to the latter work which he castigates for its 'astonishingly anachronistic air. In fact the twentieth century keeps sticking its superfluous nose into the discourse', HT 20 (1981), 94. For other works that rest upon proleptic premises, see D. R. Kelley, The Foundations of Modern Historical Scholarship (New York, 1970), J. H. Preston, 'Was There an Historical Revolution?', JHI 38 (1977); J. Levine, 'Ancients, Moderns and History: The Continuity of <34> Historical Writing' in P. J. Korshin (ed.), Studies in Change and Revolution (Menston, 1972); J. H.

Levy, Tudor Historical Thought (California, 1967); Levi Fox (ed.), English Historical Scholarship in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (Oxford, 1956). The most recent example is P. Avis, Foundations of Modern Historical Thought from Machiavelli to Vico (1986).\n\nOne of the more sensitive studies, A. M. Momigliano, 'Ancient History and the Antiquarian' in Studies in Historiography (1969), 1-40, promotes a more sophisticated argument. Momigliano suggests that during the seventeenth century the distinction between historian and antiquarian, or between collecting facts and interpreting these facts, became more pronounced. Following this development he argued that, threatened by the accusations of historical Pyrrhonism in the German universities, historiography evolved from the Renaissance rhetorical tradition of ars historica, to a more empirical notion of ars critica or textual criticism. While accepting Momigliano's thesis for the general shape of Continental historiography, I would dispute its aptness in the English context. My case is that there were crucial rhetorical elements within the development of a critical discipline in historical writing, that is in Momigliano's terms ars historica and ars critica became entangled, rather than separated. The dynamics of English historiography developed within a context of polemical dispute, rather than the purely academic or intellectual threat of scepticism.\n\n[32] See K. V. Thomas, The Perception of the Past in Early Modern England (The Creighton Trust Lecture, 1982); H. White, Tropics of Discourse. Essays in Cultural Criticism (Baltimore, 1978), especially chapter 5, 'Fictions of Factual Representation'; L. Jardine, Francis Bacon and the Art of Discourse (Cambridge, 1974). E. Said, Orientalism (1978), 9-10, is useful on the distinction between pure and political knowledge: 'The determining impingement on most knowledge produced in the contemporary West … is that it be non-political, that is scholarly, academic, impartial, above partisan, or small minded doctrinal belief.' Said attacks the liberal consensus that true knowledge is fundamentally non-political. J. G. A. Pocock, The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law (Cambridge, 1987), has recently pointed out the inherent Whiggish dangers of a history of historiography.\n\n[33] For general accounts of the epistemological crisis of the seventeenth -century mind see: <35> H.

The work is an abridgement of both classical (Lucian and Dionysus of Halicarnassus) and 'Spanish and Italian modern' (Francis Patrizi, Agostino Muscardi, Paolo Beni and Lewis Cabrera) historical methods. On Rapin-Thoyras, see R.

He wrote: 'We must not be too credulous on the one side, nor on the other hand too much affect a pyrrhonism, that is doubting of everything. In truth, if on the one side too great a credulity causes us to slip into errors, and makes us take up for true, <41> things the most dubious and false; on the other hand, an incredulity which we may entertain in the study of history, shall hinder us from reaping any benefit.'\n\n[55] F. Osborne, Advice to a Son (Oxford, 1658), 73, 74. See also the hostile injunctions of C. Agrippa, The Vanity of Arts and Sciences (1684), 2, 8, 27, against the insidious dangers of false history which was worse than the 'mad dreams of poets'.\n\n[56] Osborne, Advice to a Son, 79; on the term 'constructive scepticism', see R. Popkin, The History of Scepticism (1979).\n\n[57] Bolton, Hypercritica, 245; du Fresnoy, A New Method For Studying History, 1, 275. See also J. Locke, An Essay Concerning Understanding (1690), IV, chapter 15.4, discussing the grounds for probability: 'First, the conformity of anything with our own knowledge, observation, and experience. In the testimony of others, is to be considered: (1) the number, (2) the integrity, (3) the skill of the witnesses, (4) the design of the author, where it is a testimony out of a book cited, (5) the consistency of the parts and circumstances of the relation, (6) contrary testimonies.'\n\n[58] Leclerc, Parrhasiania, 58-61.\n\n[59] Braithwaite, A Survey, 123. For a general discussion see L. J. Davis, 'A Social History of Fact and Fiction: Authorial Disavowal in the Early English Novel' in E. Said (ed.), Literature and Society (1980); M. E. Novak, Realism, Myth, and History in Defoe's Fiction (Nebraska, 1983). A useful epitome of the tensions between factual and fictional discourse is Daniel Defoe's The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1719), which Defoe presented as a 'Just history of fact, neither is there any appearance of fiction in it'. Defoe was attacked by the converted deist Charles Gildon in The Life and Strange Adventures of Mr D … de F … (1719) which condemned Defoe's manipulative and false history. Defoe was to defend his 'emblematic history' in The Serious Reflections … of Robinson Crusoe (1720). For Defoe historical writing was a valid mode of literary discourse, useful for conveying moral or religious principle to the reader.\n\n[60] Braithwaite, A Survey, 239.\n\n[61] Aristotle wrote: 'That being probable that for the most part and most usually happens to be; not simply, as some would have it to be; but as being that, which in those things that may be otherwise has the same relation to probable, as universal to particular.' Hobbes, Art of Rhetoric, 13. See also John Locke's notions on probability and witnesses in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), IV, chapters 15 and 16, at IV, 16.xi defending history: 'I would not be thought here to lessen the credit and use of history: it is all the light <43> we have in many cases, and we receive from it a great part of the useful truths we have, with a convincing evidence.'\n\n[62] Aristotle, Rhetoric, 236-7.\n\n[63] Ibid., 248-9.\n\n[64] The ability to confer credit on a thesis was given further treatment in Aristotle's Rhetoric IV, chapter 23, 'Of Confirmation'. Here 'just and profitable proofs' drawn from examples, common opinions, and recapitulations were to be deployed, see Aristotle, Rhetoric, 271-3. For a further discussion of the idea of 'probability', see I. Hacking, The Emergence of Probability (Cambridge, 1984), especially 11-39. Note also the case of the Newtonian and friend of Gilbert Burnet, John Craig, and his Theologia Christiane Principia Mathematica (1699), edited by G. Nadel in History and Theory, supplement 4 (The Hague, 1964). This work attacked monkish histories, and created a mathematical method for calculating the probability of historical data. He argued that 'after 3150 years from the birth of Christ the probability of his written history will vanish'. It was thus likely that Christ would return to earth before this date. Note F. Atterbury, The Epistolary Correspondence, (4 volumes, 1789), 1, 86-7: Atterbury to Trelawny, 11 March 1701, reporting the indictment of Craig's work alongside that of Toland's Christianity Not Mysterious (1696) in the Lower Convocation Committee for inspecting books. He wrote: 'I bring in tomorrow a book of one Craig, a Scotch-man, chaplain to the Bishop of Sarum, to prove, by mathematical calculation, that, according to the pretension of the probability of historical evidence, in such a space of time (which he mentions) the Christian religion will not be credible. It is dedicated to the Bishop.'\n\n[65] Hobbes was to describe this process of conviction; commenting on Aristotle's Rhetoric he wrote: 'That the Judge, while he hears the facts proved probable, conceives it as true. For the understanding has no object but truth. And therefore by and by, when he hear an instance to the contrary; and thereby find that he had no necessity to think it true, presently changes his opinion, and thinks it false, and consequently not so much as probable. For he cannot at one time think the same thing both probable and false: and he that says a thing is probable, the meaning is he thinks it true, but finds not arguments enough to prove it' (Art of Rhetoric, 97-8).\n\n[66] Atterbury, Rights, Powers, and Priviledges of an English Convocation (1700), Sig.

Hody, A Letter from Mr Humphrey Hody to a Friend (Oxford, 1692), 4-6, 8-9.\n\n[92] Ibid., 15-16, 18.\n\n[93] As already noted above, Locke, particularly in the Essay, recommended the didactic value of history. John Toland is perhaps an even more persuasive case. S. Daniel, John Toland: His Methods, Manners, and Mind (McGill, 1984) gives the most detailed discussion of this facet of Toland's polemic, although Daniel's notion of Toland as an 'historian-exegete' lacks an explicatory humanist framework (see 28, 56-8). Toland's promotion of history as a weapon against priestcraft (i.e. as a hypothetical rather than categorical activity) was central to his polemic. In Christianity Not Mysterious Toland's epistemological category 'Evidence', was not mere philosophical investigation, but practical advice on how to attain just moral precepts; see CNM, 14, 16-19, 21-2. It seems likely that Toland was following Hobbes (compare Leviathan, 410 with CNM, 14-16) rather than Locke. I do not intend to trace the penetration of historical ideas down into the realms of the popular press since the research of B. Capp and M. Spufford have admirably illustrated this dissemination. B. Capp, Astrology and the Popular Press: English Almanacs 1500-1800 (Cambridge, 1981), M. Spufford, Small Books and Pleasant Histories (1981). For literacy and popular readership, see D. Cressy, Literacy and the Social Order (Cambridge, 1980), and C.J. Sommerville, Popular Religion in Restoration England (Gainsville, 1977)."
