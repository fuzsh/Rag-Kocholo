Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in simpler, faster, and reliable analytical methods for assessing food quality attributes. Spectroscopic Methods in Food Analysis presents the basic concepts of spectroscopic methods, together with a discussion on the most important applications in food analysis.\n\nThe determination of product quality and authenticity and the detection of adulteration are major issues in the food industry, causing concern among consumers and special attention among food manufacturers. As such, this book explains why spectroscopic methods have been extensively employed to the analysis of food products as they often require minimal or no sample preparation, provide rapid and on-line analysis, and have the potential to run multiple tests on a single sample (i.e., non-destructive). This book consists of concepts related to food quality and authenticity, that are quite broad, given the different demands of the manufacturer, the consumer, the surveillance and the legislative bodies that ultimately provide healthy and safe products.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nSpectroscopic Methods in Food Analysis\n\nFood Analysis & Properties Series Editor\n\nLeo M.

The concepts of food quality and authenticity are quite broad, given the different demands of the manufacturer, consumer, oversight, and legislative bodies that will ultimately provide healthy and safe products, taking into account both economic and environmental issues. Given the inherent complexity of food products, most instrumental techniques (e.g., chromatographic methods) employed for quality and authenticity evaluation are time consuming, expensive, and labor intensive. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in simpler, faster, and more reliable analytical methods for assessing food quality attributes. Spectroscopic methods have been extensively employed in the analysis of food products because they often require minimal or no sample preparation, provide rapid and online analysis, and have the potential to run multiple tests on a single sample (i.e., nondestructive). Therefore, this book is dedicated to spectroscopic techniques that are of relevance to food analysis. This book is divided into three parts: Part I—Fundamentals and instrumentation, Part II—Applications, and Part III—Food products. Part I begins with a comprehensive and historic overview of spectroscopic methods (Chapter 1) followed by an extensive discussion on fundamental and theoretical aspects as well as new trends on each technique (Chapters 2 through 8), instrumentation (Chapter 9), and statistical analysis (Chapter 10). Part II focuses on the specific application of these techniques in food analysis, dealing with important issues such as composition (Chapter 11), authentication (Chapter 12), adulteration (Chapter 13), and food quality (Chapter 14). Part III presents the recent advances in spectroscopy for the analysis of specific food products including beverages (Chapters 15 and 16), cereals (Chapters 17 and 18), coffee (Chapter 19), edible oils (Chapter 20), dairy products (Chapter 21), fish and meat (Chapter 22), fruits and vegetables (Chapter 23), and other food products (Chapter 24). All chapters have been written by renowned scientists who are experts in their research fields. We would like to thank all contributing authors and colleagues for their effort in producing this excellent book. They are the ones who made this project possible. “As coisas tangíveis tornam-se insensíveis à palma da mão.

It is important for determining food safety, accompanying food and beverage production, and for the control of food, beverages, and packaging in general. The study of spectroscopy is considered to have begun with Isaac Newton’s experiments with the dispersion of light into its components of various wavelengths with the aid of a prism (Thomas 1991; James 2007). However, nothing more was studied until the time of William Wollaston, who improved upon Newton’s experiment in 1802. The dark lines that appeared in the spectrum (Figure 1.1) were later studied by Joseph von Fraunhofer (Jackson 2000), followed by Anders J. Angstrom, who measured the wavelengths of these lines. Fraunhofer also constructed a grating that achieved greater resolution in the dispersion of light than the prism (Pasquini 2003). Sir John Herschel studied the spectrum of flames in 1822 and laid the foundation for spectral analyses. In 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff suggested that substances emitted and absorbed light at the same wavelength. These and other studies were the basis of Bohr’s theory of the atom, which specified that electrons existed in discrete energy levels in the atom (Thomas 1991). August Beer later proposed the linear relationship between absorbance and concentration, which has since been the basis for the quantitative determination of substances by measurements of absorbance or transmittance in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) regions (Thomas 1991). Electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum. The oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to\n\n3\n\n4\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\nKH\n\nh g Gf e\n\nd h\n\n390400\n\nF\n\n450\n\nc\n\nD\n\nb E h 4-1\n\n3–1\n\n550\n\n500\n\nC\n\na\n\nB\n\n650\n\n600\n\nA\n\n750\n\n700\n\nWavelength in nm\n\nSolar spectrum with Fraunhofer lines.

Electromagnetic waves can be characterized by either the frequency or wavelength of their oscillations, which determines their position in the electromagnetic spectrum (Crowell 2013). Electromagnetic radiation involves a wide range of wavelengths, as is shown in Figure 1.2. The electromagnetic spectrum refers to all the known frequencies and their linked wavelengths of the known photons. The electromagnetic spectrum extends from above the long wavelengths (high frequencies) used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the shortwavelength (high-frequency) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom (Mehta 2011). The range of energies involved in this range of wavelengths varies from 12.4 feV to 1.24 Mev. In principle, the upper limit for the possible wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation is the dimension of the universe. The theoretical lower limit is thought to be the Planck length (1.616199(97) × 10 −35 m) (Bakshi and Godse 2009). Although all the wavelengths shown in Figure 1.2 can be used for analysis, the range of wavelengths usually employed in spectroscopy is relatively narrow and includes mainly the UV, visible, infrared (IR), ultrasound, and FM radio (nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]) regions.\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n5\n\n1.1 UV–VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY UV light was discovered by J. W. Ritter in 1801 (Thomas 1991). However, there remained no method by which to measure UV radiation until the development of the photodetector in the 1930s. The first commercial UV–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometer was introduced by Beckman in 1941 (Buie 2011). The absorbance of light in the UV–Vis region occurs when an electron is excited and passes from a bonding or nonbonding orbital to an antibonding orbital. The amount of energy required to excite an electron depends on the difference in energy between the ground state and the excited state. Transitions of the σ–σ*, σ–π*, π–σ*, or simple π–π* type require light in the vacuum UV region. However, conjugated π systems exhibit π–π* transitions that absorb in the region between 200 and 800 nm. In conjugated systems, the excited state is more greatly stabilized by resonance than the ground state, so the difference in energy between the two states is smaller than in nonconjugated systems (Silverstein et al. 1974). The smaller the difference in energy between the ground state and the excited state, the greater is the probability that a transition between the ground state and the excited state will occur. The intensity of the absorbance is a function of this probability. For a given concentration, the intensity of absorbance will be greater when the difference in energy between the ground and excited state is small. And, this difference will be smaller when there is a greater degree of conjugation in the molecule. The nonbonding (n) electrons normally have a higher energy than the ground state pi electrons. The nonbonding electrons are held less strongly. Therefore, the difference in energy between the nonbonding orbitals and the antibonding (π*) orbital is small, and the absorbance corresponding to this n–π* transition occurs at a longer wavelength than the π–π* transition. However, the nonbonding orbitals are perpendicular to the π* orbitals, and there is very little overlap between the two. Therefore, the probability that a nonbonding electron will be excited to a π* orbital is extremely small, and the intensity of the corresponding absorbance will also be very low. This transition is said to be “forbidden.” The absorption bands in the UV–Vis region are very wide. The electronic state is made up of several vibrational energy sublevels. These different vibrational energy levels are each composed of several rotational energy levels. The energy differences between the vibrational levels are much smaller than the differences between electronic energy states and the differences between rotational energy levels are even smaller. The electronic excited state also has several vibrational and rotational energy sublevels. Excitation of the electron involves a transition from any one of the vibrational and rotational levels in the ground state to any of the vibrational and rotational levels in the electronic excited state, resulting in several absorptions with small differences in wavelength that form very wide bands. UV–Vis spectroscopy has been widely used for the quantitative analysis of substances that absorb in this region because of the high sensitivity of the method. The UV–Vis detector has long been employed in chromatography, especially of proteins, and has been especially useful in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of many classes of compounds. It has also proved useful for the qualitative identification of pure substances, although the quantity of information provided by the UV–Vis spectrum is much more limited than that of some other spectroscopic techniques. The proposal by R. B. Woodward (1941, 1942a,b) of a set of empirical rules for calculating the λ max of the absorbance of unsaturated compounds was an important tool in the identification of such compounds.\n\n6\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\nA development that increased the usefulness of UV–Vis spectroscopy was the use of derivatives of the original spectra (Griffiths et al. 1982; Rojas et al. 1988). The first to fourth derivative of the spectra can be obtained, and this mathematical technique has been incorporated into the instrumentation. This technique permits the identification and quantification of mixtures of substances, whereas this identification is much more difficult or impossible in the original spectrum. This technique has been used in many studies, such as the determination of tyrosine in proteins (Ragone et al. 1984), the detection of toxic substances (Gill et al. 1982), the study of the fractions obtained from the partial hydrolysis of casein and other proteins (Silvestre et al. 1993), and the determination of phenylalanine in wheat flour (Carreira et al. 2009). The development of the diode-array detector was especially useful because it became possible to simultaneously measure the absorbance at several wavelengths, and the spectrum could be registered while determining the concentration of the substance eluted from a column. Another more recent development is the use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for the analysis of substances, including food and nanostructures (Gao and Wachs 2000; Morales et al. 2007; Rossel et al. 2006; Liu 2016), although this spectroscopic technique has been more extensively used in the mid- and near-infrared (NIR) regions. Reflectance spectroscopy does not require modification of the sample and can be applied for quality control on the production line. This technique is one of the advancements in spectroscopy that has been made possible by the development of multivariate analysis and other chemometric techniques, without which the spectra obtained would make no sense. Instrumental modifications necessary for the recording of reflectance spectra have also played a major role in this type of analysis and in the use of microspectroscopy, where the spectrometer is adapted to a microscope and spectra can be obtained from minute particles or cells (Les 2010). When the substance does not absorb significantly in the UV–Vis region, derivatization can be performed to obtain a product that does absorb in this region. An example is the preparation of phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives of amino acids that do not have aromatic rings (Nollet and Toldrá 2012). Of course, it is essential that the reaction be 100% complete.\n\n1.2 FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY Fluorescence spectroscopy is a very valuable, highly sensitive technique for determining the quantity of certain kinds of substances that possess the capability to fluoresce. In 1565, Nicolás Monardes, a Spanish physician and botanist, reported a bluish opalescence from a water infusion of the wood from a Mexican tree. A Franciscan missionary named Bernardino de Sahagún observed a similar phenomenon in a wood named “coatli.” Both woods were reported to have medicinal benefits for the kidney. This type of luminescence has since been reported in chlorophyll, barium sulfate, quinine, acridine, fluorosceine, and rhodamine. In 1845, Sir John Frederick William Herschel observed the fluorescence from a solution of quinine sulfate and termed this phenomenon as “epipolic dispersion.” In 1852, G. G. Stokes invented the term fluorescence from the mineral fluorspar. He was also the first person to propose the use of fluorescence as an analytical tool (Chakraborty 2013). The first fluorimetric analysis was performed by F. Goppelsröder in 1867 for the quantitative determination of Al(III) from the fluorescence of its morin chelate. Otto Heimstaedt and Heinrich Lehmann (1911–1913) first developed the fluorescence microscope to investigate the autofluorescence of biosamples such as bacteria, protozoa,\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n7\n\nplant, and animal tissues. Later, the American Instrument Company collaborated with Dr. Robert Bowman who designed and marketed the first spectrophotofluorimeter (SPF) in 1956 (National Institutes of Health 2016). Antimalarial research actually initiated the invention of the SPF as an analytical instrument that can determine the presence of analytes that fluoresce. The story dated back to 1940, during World War II, when scientists in the United States were required to determine the amount of drug that reached the malarial parasites in a patient’s blood for a clinical trial of antimalarial drugs. Bernard Brodie and Sidney Udenfriend of Goldwater Memorial Hospital in New York City designed a new test using an instrument called a fluorometer that could determine the amount of the drugs in the blood plasma from the intensity of the fluorescence emitted from the drug, because many of the drugs used in the trial fluoresce. This observation helped them to come up with a critical dose of a drug to minimize adverse side effects (National Institutes of Health 2016). Normally, only aromatic or highly unsaturated organic compounds fluoresce. One of the advantages of fluorescence spectroscopy over absorption spectroscopy is the fact that these compounds can be detected in the presence of substances that do not fluoresce. Therefore, they can be detected in mixtures without the competition of nonfluorescing compounds. The technique has several advantages and some limitations. If the compound to be analyzed does not fluoresce, it must be derivatized or tagged to form a product that does fluoresce. An example is the detection of polyamines and biogenic amines when they are separated by HPLC (Ubaldo et al. 2015; Custódio et al. 2015; Kalac and Glória 2009; Fernandes and Glória 2015). These amines do not fluoresce, so they are treated with o-phthalaldehyde to produce a fluorescent derivative that can be detected by the fluorescence detector. A 100% conversion to the derivative is necessary. o-Phthalaldehyde, 4-dimethylaminobenzenesulfonyl chloride, 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride, and 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate have also been used to prepare fluorescent derivatives of amino acids and peptides (Nollet and Toldrá 2012). In fluorescence spectroscopy, the substance absorbs light in the UV, visible, or NIR region of the electromagnetic radiation. The electrons are excited from a singlet ground state to one of several singlet excited states (Figure 1.3). The electron then decays to the 3 S1 2 1 0\n\nNonradiative transition\n\nAbsorption\n\nEnergy\n\nFluorescence\n\n3 S0 2 1 0 Ground state\n\nJablonski diagram showing the intersystem decay and fluorescence after absorption of light.

Therefore, the wavelength of the light emitted is longer than the wavelength of the absorbed light. This shift to a longer wavelength is known as the Stokes shift. The λ max of the light emitted does not shift with the wavelength of the light being absorbed; only the intensity of the light emitted is affected because the intensity of the light emitted depends on the number of excited molecules, and the number of molecules that become excited depends on the wavelength of the light being absorbed. The spectral range for most fluorescence measurements is 200–1000 nm (Wehry 1997). As with absorption spectroscopy, there is a transition from the lowest singlet state to a variety of vibrational levels in the ground state, so the emission band is relatively wide. Fluorescence spectroscopy is orders of magnitude more sensitive than most other methods of detection of organic compounds. One of the reasons for the greater sensitivity when compared to UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy is the fact that any light emitted is compared to a black background. In absorption spectroscopy, if the concentration of the sample is very dilute, the difference between the absorbance of the sample and that of the reference cell will be minimal. That is, the amount of light transmitted will be nearly the same, and two large values with only a slight difference between them will be compared. In fluorescence spectroscopy, there is zero light emitted by the reference, so any light emitted by the sample can be more easily detected. Detection limits down to 10 −10 mol L −1 or lower can be reached, and extremely small samples can be used. The sensitivity depends on the quantum yield, which represents the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed. Another important factor is the lifetime of the excited state because it represents the time available for the excited electron to interact with its environment (Lakowicz 1999). An advantage of fluorescence spectroscopy over the UV–Vis absorption technique is the fact that two frequencies (absorption and emission maxima) are available for identification of a compound rather than only one. If two sample constituents with similar absorption spectra fluoresce at different wavelengths, they may be distinguished from one another by the appropriate choice of emission wavelength. Or, if two compounds have similar fluorescence spectra but absorb strongly at different wavelengths, they may be distinguished by proper choice of excitation wavelength (Wehry 1997). When the fluorescent spectrum is composed of contributions from a mixture of compounds, synchronized scanning spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between the components of the mixture (Sikorska et al. 2005). In synchronized fluorometry, the absorption spectrum and the emission spectrum are recorded simultaneously with a constant difference in wavelength between the two. Another advantage is that the technique is fast and simple and the equipment is relatively robust so that it can be used in the field for preliminary analyses. It is also possible to detect emissions remotely if fiber optics or excitation with lasers is employed. This advantage means that the technique can be used for environmental studies and for the control of food products during production without the necessity for extraction or other types of modification of the product. In these cases, filter fluorometers can be used because the intensity of fluorescence at single excitation and emission wavelengths can be measured to detect specific analytes without the need for high resolution or array detectors. Portability, low cost, and small size are most important. A large number of photons can be transmitted by filters, and this characteristic makes them useful for trace analyses. Laboratory fluorometers usually employ grating monochromators.\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n9\n\nOne of the limitations of the use of fluorescence spectroscopy is the fact that the glassware and solvents utilized must be very clean so that no fluorescent impurities will interfere with the fluorescence from the sample. Extensive cleanup of mixtures, such as chromatography, may be required, and this process can be time consuming. Solvents that absorb in the UV region cannot be used. Another possible interference is the presence of substances that absorb in the same region in which the analyte emits light, thereby reducing the quantum yield. Photobleaching can sometimes occur, especially in the case of fluorescent probes that might be submitted to radiation over a prolonged period. Photobleaching occurs when a photolytic reaction causes a rupture in one or more bonds and results in the loss of fluorescence (ThermoFisher Scientific 2016). The last type of interference involves quenching, which can occur when some substance interacts with the excited state of the molecule and inhibits fluorescence. The possibility of quenching in mixtures means that care should be exercised during calibration. Quenching can be caused by collision with another molecule, such as iodide, oxygen, and acrylamide, or by the formation of a nonfluorescing complex. This latter type of quenching occurs in the ground state. Quenching can also occur because of attenuation of the incident light by either the fluorophore or some other species (Lakowicz 1999). The lifetime of the excited state can furnish some information regarding its interactions with other molecules in the environment. The lifetime of the excited state might be sufficiently long so that the solvent molecules can reorient themselves around the molecule. This relaxation of the solvent is responsible for the Stokes shift caused by the solvent (Lakowicz 1999). The Stokes shift can indicate whether a protein is folded or if the fluorophore (tryptophan) is exposed to the solvent water. The shift for a tryptophan residue buried within the protein molecule will be different from that of a residue on the surface. Labeling with extrinsic probes can also be used to determine the environment within a macromolecule. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements can furnish information regarding the size and shape of proteins. Fluorescence anisotropy involves the photoselective excitation by polarized light. Those fluorophores whose absorption transition dipole is parallel to the electronic vector of the excitation will be preferentially excited. The population of molecules will be partially oriented, and the light emitted will be partially polarized. Fluorescence anisotropy can be reduced by rotational diffusion. If the fluorophore is bound to a large molecule such as a protein or a membrane, rotational diffusion becomes very limited and anisotropy is more easily observed (Lakowicz 1999). If the emission spectrum of the fluorophore overlaps with the absorption spectrum of another molecule, the energy of the excited state can be transferred by resonance without the emission of light (Lakowicz 1999). The effect depends on whether the two species are free in solution, covalently linked, or trapped within a membrane or nucleic acid molecule. Resonance energy transfer can be used to measure distances between sites on a macromolecule. There are two types of fluorescence measurements: steady-state and time-resolved measurements. The steady-state measurement is the more commonly used. The timeresolved measurement measures the rate of decay of the intensity of the emitted light or the anisotropy. The anisotropic decay furnishes information regarding the molecular shape and flexibility. The decay in intensity also furnishes information regarding the conformation of the molecule or the presence of more than one conformation. Fluorimetric detectors are widely used in chromatography, especially HPLC, and in electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis is a relatively new technique that achieves\n\n10\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\na high degree of resolution of the components in the sample. Fluorescence detection is a very valuable tool for detecting these components. By employing front-face fluorescence spectroscopy, food samples can be analyzed without destruction of the sample (Karoui et al. 2006; Veberg et al. 2006). It is also a valuable technique for the analysis of proteins and peptides (Ladokhin 2000), as well as nucleic acids (Lakowicz 1999; Ono et al. 2012; Suzuki et al. 1997; Behlke et al. 2005; Xiao and Kwok 2003) and for applications such as determining bitterness in beer (Christensen et al. 2005). Other important subjects include phase-sensitive and phase-modulation resolution of emission spectra, DNA sequencing, fluorescence sensing, time-resolved protein fluorescence, excited state reactions, and energy transfer to multiple acceptors (Lakowicz 1999).\n\n1.3 FOURIER TRANSFORM IR SPECTROSCOPY The existence of IR radiation was discovered by Herschel in 1800 (Herschel 1800a,b). However, no more interest in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum existed until absorption spectra were obtained in 1882 by Abney and Festing (1886). They also correlated the absorption bands with some functional groups. In 1903, Coblenz (1906) correlated the absorbances in the mid-IR region with the vibrations of functional groups. The recording of IR spectra was difficult until Perkin-Elmer and Beckman developed the first commercial instruments (Thomas 1991). Midrange IR spectroscopy was the most extensively employed because of its usefulness for the identification of the vibrations of functional groups in pure compounds. In addition, the supports for liquids and solids were inexpensive and easily prepared. The technique was highly valuable as a tool for use in the identification of compounds. It could be used for the identification of liquids using films supported between sodium chloride plates. Spectra of solids could be obtained in solution, in the form of a mull or as a suspension in a KBr pellet. The technique measured the IR light transmitted through the sample. The resulting spectra were not exactly reproducible because the concentration of the sample and conditions were difficult to reproduce exactly. In addition, for aqueous solutions or humid samples, the supports used needed to be insoluble in water. Also, the IR bands corresponding to water interfered with some of those obtained with organic compounds such as alcohols, amines, and amides. The use of midrange IR transmission spectroscopy for the study of pure compounds is very useful, but for the study of foods, it is somewhat limited because of the complexity of the matrices. The energy levels involved in these vibrations are low (2.5–25 μm wavelength). For the vibration to result in an absorption band in the spectrum, the vibration must cause a change in the dipole moment of the molecule. There are basically two methods by which one can obtain the IR absorption spectrum. The original IR instruments were of the dispersive type. These instruments separated the individual frequencies of energy emitted from the IR source by the use of a prism or grating, and a few wavelengths at a time passed through a slit and then through the sample. The grating is a more modern dispersive element that furnishes a better resolution of the frequencies of IR energy. The detector measures the amount of energy at each frequency that has passed through the sample. This results in a spectrum, which is a plot of intensity versus frequency or wavelength. This method is slow. Because of the necessity for the light to pass through a slit, part of the energy transmitted by the sample is lost. The second method is called Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In this method, the light that impinges on the sample is composed of all of the wavelengths, and\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n11\n\nthe computer transforms the signals of all of the transmitted wavelengths into a spectrum using a mathematical technique, the Fourier transformation. Instead of a prism or grating, an interferometer is used. The spectrum is obtained in a few seconds instead of a few minutes. After passing through the interferometer, the beam passes through the sample and impinges on the detector. The signal that is measured is digitized and sent to the computer where the transformation takes place. FTIR still involves the transmission of light through the sample and, thus, suffers from some of the same limitations that dispersive instruments possess (Thomas 1991; Blum and John 2012). This technique has been used for the study of proteins and protein–ligand interactions (Jung 2000). It has also been used for the characterization of spoilage fungi (Shapaval et al. 2013) and for the study of phospholipids in edible oils (Meng et al. 2014). Other examples of the use of FTIR for the analysis of foods include its use for the determination of thermoxidized olive oil (Tena et al. 2013), the study of defective and normal coffees (Craig et al. 2012), the detection of H 2O2 in food (Şansal and Somer 1999), the study of the secondary structure and conformation changes in polyphenol oxidase (Baltacioğlu et al. 2015), and the detection of adulteration in food (Rodriguez-Saona and Allendorf 2011).\n\n1.3.1 Attenuated Total Reflectance Although transmission measurements are used, the diffuse reflectance measurements have proved to be much more useful for the analysis of food. New techniques of surface analysis (Chabal 1988) and reflectance analysis (NUANCE 2016) have been employed. These techniques facilitate the monitoring of foods during the production process without the destruction of the sample. Thus, the detection of adulteration and the determination of the quality of the product can frequently be accomplished more rapidly. The technique is called attenuated total reflectance (ATR). It is a sampling technique used in conjunction with IR spectroscopy that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further separation and purification (Carter et al. 2010). In this aspect, it is similar to Raman spectroscopy (RS) (Mauricio-Iglesias et al. 2009). A beam of IR light is passed through an ATR crystal so that it reflects at least once off the internal surface in contact with the sample. This reflection forms an evanescent wave, which extends into the sample to a depth of 0.5–2 μm with each reflection along the top surface (NUANCE 2016). The exact value is dependent on the wavelength of the light, the angle of incidence, and the indices of refraction for the ATR crystal and the medium being probed (Minnich et al. 2010), the efficiency of sample contact, the area of contact with the sample, and the crystal material (SpectraTech 2000). The number of reflections can be varied by varying the angle of incidence. The beam is collected by a detector as it exits the crystal. Most modern IR spectrometers can be converted to ATR by mounting the ATR accessory in the spectrometer’s sample compartment (WOW 2016; Sawant 2016). The sampling surface is pressed into intimate contact with the top surface of a crystal such as KRS-5, ZnSe, or germanium. To obtain internal reflectance, the angle of incidence must exceed the critical angle. This angle is a function of the refractive indices of both the sample and the ATR crystal. The evanescent wave decays into the sample exponentially with distance from the surface of the crystal over a distance on the order of micrometers. The depth of penetration of the evanescent wave is defined as the distance from the crystal–sample interface at which the intensity of the evanescence decays to 1/e\n\n12\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\n(37%) of its original value. Different crystals have different refractive indices because of the crystal material. Different crystals are applied to different transmission ranges (ZnSe for 20,000–650 cm−1 and Ge for 5500–800 cm−1) (NUANCE 2016; Sawant 2016). In a spectrum obtained by transmission, the path length is the thickness of the sample. In ATR, the effective path length (EPL) can be calculated as EPL = penetration depth × number of reflections. The EPL is directly related to the absorbance intensity. An increase in either the depth of penetration or in the number of reflections will increase the absorbance intensity of the spectrum. The penetration depth of the IR energy into the sample is proportional to the wavelength. In other words, the depth of penetration decreases when the wavenumber increases. Thus, the relative band intensities in the ATR spectrum decrease with increasing wavenumbers when compared to a transmission spectrum of the same sample (SpectraTech 2000; Suraj 2013). Examples of the use of ATR include the study of the structure, orientation, and tertiary structure changes in peptides and membrane proteins (Vigano et al. 2000), the study of the structure of potato starch (van Soest et al. 1995), the drying process of sodium alginate films (Xiao et al. 2014), and the determination of linoleic acid in potato chips (Kadamne et al. 2011). Micro-ATR IR spectroscopy has also been investigated (Suraj 2013). ATR-IR has been applied to the microfluidic flow of aqueous solutions in microreactors (Greener et al. 2010) or in flow cells (Carter et al. 2010; Minnich et al. 2010).\n\n1.3.2 Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is a technique that collects and analyzes scattered IR energy. It is used for measurement of fine particles and powders, as well as rough surfaces (NUANCE 2016). When an IR beam enters the sample, it can either be reflected off the surface of a particle or be transmitted through a particle. The IR energy reflecting off the surface is usually lost. The IR beam that passes through a particle can either reflect off the next particle or be transmitted through the next particle. This transmission–reflectance event can occur many times in the sample. The scattered IR energy is focused onto the detector. The IR light is partially absorbed by the sample particles, and this absorption yields information regarding the sample. In the case of colloids and particles in suspension in a volatile solvent, the solvent can be evaporated and the spectrum obtained on the residue (NUANCE 2016).\n\n1.4 NIR SPECTROSCOPY The NIR and far-IR regions of the spectrum originally furnished much less information about the composition of material because of the wide, overlapping peaks and weak absorbance. NIR began to be employed in 1938, but its use only took hold in the 1980s. The first work on the analytical exploitation of the NIR spectral region involved the determination of the amount of water in gelatin by employing its absorption in the NIR region (Ellis and Bath 1938). Barchewitz was the first to apply NIR spectroscopy for the analysis of fuel (Barchewitz 1943). Other studies were performed in the 1950s (Evans\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n13\n\net al. 1951; White and Barrett 1956; Whetsel et al. 1958) on the use of NIR for the study of mixtures and its obedience to Beer’s law (Pasquini 2003). NIR spectroscopy is a type of vibrational spectroscopy that employs photon energy (hν) in the energy range from 2.65 × 1019 to 7.96 × 1020 J, which corresponds to the wavelength range from 750 to 2500 nm (Pasquini 2003). The technique has various advantages: It is fast, nondestructive, and noninvasive, and requires very limited sample preparation. The radiation is highly penetrating and can be used for analyses on the production line. Nearly any molecule containing CH, NH, SH, or OH bonds can be detected. Because of its high penetrability, which allows the detection of substances within the upper layers of tissue, NIR has been employed for the study of the brain and muscle physiology (Ferrari and Quaresima 2004). Several constituents can be measured simultaneously (Osborne 2006). However, because of the large number of wavelengths and absorbances that must normally be computed, the technique requires the use of chemometric techniques and computer control and analysis. It also requires good standards that are adequate for defining the data points that should be measured. It is a secondary method of analysis. A primary method is required to furnish the analytical results necessary for modeling of the NIR spectral data. The model may be very complicated and may need to be updated frequently because of changes in the sample matrix. Robust models might require that many samples be analyzed by the primary method. Also, the technique is not very sensitive; the limit of determination is approximately 0.1% (Pasquini 2003). Although absorption measurements are used, the diffuse reflectance measurements have proved to be much more useful for the analysis of food. New techniques of surface analysis (Chabal 1988) have been employed. These techniques facilitate the monitoring of foods during the production process without the destruction of the sample. Thus, the detection of adulteration and the determination of the quality of products can frequently be accomplished more rapidly. The NIR region is composed principally of overtones and combination bands corresponding to absorptions in the mid-IR region, as well as the NIR region. The bands observed in the NIR region are weak and generally poorly resolved. Each successive overtone band is approximately an order of magnitude less intense than the preceding one. Thus, several choices of absorptions of different intensity containing the same chemical information are available. Because water absorbs weakly in this region, high-moisture foods can be analyzed (Osborne 2006). The first type of instrument employed was the dispersive type, which used diffraction gratings. These instruments were used in the early days of NIR spectroscopy and are still being used. They are of relatively low cost compared with other NIR instruments. The main disadvantages of dispersive instruments are the slow scan speed and a lack of wavelength precision, which deteriorates during long-term operation because of mechanical fatigue. Also, the presence of moving parts limits the use of dispersive instruments in the field. However, the development of linear sensor arrays allows the entire spectrum to be scanned in a few seconds, and the lack of moving parts in such instruments means that the dispersive optics have a longer lifetime. The NIR instruments may use filters to determine the wavelengths to be detected. These instruments are more limited with respect to the range of wavelengths available, but are less expensive and are used mostly for measuring the quantities of specific substances such as water, proteins, and fats. They are usually more robust and have found use in the field or in the online control of production (Morimoto et al. 2001). NIR instruments that use filters are more robust because the optical parts are not harmed by environmental humidity. The detectors for the NIR spectral region are usually based on silicon, PbS, and\n\n14\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\nInGa. The last has a high sensitivity and response speed. When high-powered radiation sources are used, these detectors can impart a very high signal-to-noise ratio. Light-emitting diode (LED)-based instruments can produce NIR radiation with a bandwidth of about 30–50 nm, centered in any wavelength of the spectral region. The instruments can employ a set of LEDs as sources of narrow NIR bands (Ellekker et al. 1993; Evans et al. 1993) or use them to produce a polychromatic, highly stable source whose radiation is dispersed by using common monochromator devices such as those based on gratings or filter optics (Goto 1989). The LED and filter instruments are of lower cost, they are smaller, and they can be more adequate for use in the field (Pasquini 2003). The fourth type of instrument is based on acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs) (Abe et al. 1996). Such instruments utilize a technology that involves no moving parts. They are capable of very high speeds over a wide range of the spectral region. The scan speed is very fast, and random access to a large number of frequencies is possible. The type of spectrophotometer of choice for research utilizes the interferometer and Fourier transform to convert the intensities of the individual frequencies. These instruments possess the highest precision and accuracy of wavelength, a high signal-to-noise ratio, and a high scan speed, although they are slower than AOTF-based instruments (Kays and Barton 2003). These instruments do not have entrance or exit slits that can limit the intensity of the radiation reaching the detector. The wavelength accuracy is better than 0.05 nm and the resolution can reach values below 1 nm in the NIR region. However, the instruments are more expensive than the dispersive or filter types, and they are less robust than the filter or AOTF-based instruments. Some of the applications of NIR spectroscopy include agricultural products, industrial food products, precision agricultural or soil analyses, polymer processing, polymer quality characteristics, fuel quality control, fuel production processes, petroleum, environmental analyses, textiles, biomedical or clinical analyses, pharmacy and cosmetics, and NIR imaging (Williams and Norris 1987; Pasquini 2003). NIR spectroscopy is used routinely for the compositional, functional, and sensory analysis of food ingredients, process intermediates, and the final products (Pasquini 2003). NIR spectroscopy has been used to determine protein content (Kays et al. 2000) and soluble and insoluble dietary fiber (Kays 1998; Kays and Barton 2002) in cereal foods and to predict gross energy and usable energy (Kays and Barton 2003). Evans et al. (1993) utilized NIR spectroscopy to determine the authenticity of orange juice. It has also been employed to determine the protein and lactose contents of goat’s milk (Diaz-Carrillo et al. 1993) and the protein, casein, and fat contents in cow’s milk (Laporte and Paquin 1999). Studies of starch and water in cereal food products have been performed (Osborne 1996). The control of the variation in water content of foods (Wahlby and Skjoldebrand 2001) is another application.\n\n1.5 RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman discovered Raman radiation in 1928 using sunlight as the source, a telescope as a collector, and his eye as the detector. Later, lamps using helium, bismuth, lead, zinc, and mercury were tested, and the mercury lamp was adopted, followed by the mercury burner and the mercury arc. Other types of lamps were studied, but in 1962, the laser source was developed (Ferraro et al. 2003). Photographic plates were first used as detectors until the photomultiplier tube was developed after World War II. Double and triple monochromators were introduced to reduce stray light. Fourier\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n15\n\ntransform RS is currently available and can be used alone or in combination with FTIR spectroscopy (Ferraro et al. 2003). RS is a molecular spectroscopy and depends on the existence of covalent bonds; therefore, it can be applied to both organic and inorganic compounds. RS is highly selective and can differentiate molecules and chemical species that are very similar. RS involves the excitation of bonding electrons by IR radiation to a virtual excited state (Figure 1.4). When the electron decays and emits light at the same wavelength as the excitation energy, it is called Rayleigh scattering and corresponds to elastically scattered light. Raman scattering occurs when the radiation emitted is of a longer or shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation, and it is called inelastically scattered light. When the light emitted is of a longer wavelength than the absorbed light, it is known as Stokes scattering. When the light emitted is of a shorter wavelength than the absorbed light, it is known as antiStokes scattering. The most common type of scattering is Rayleigh scattering, followed by Stokes scattering. Raman scattering produces very weak bands. Only one in every 10 million photons are inelastically scattered, and the photon transfers some of its energy to the molecule. One problem with RS is the need to distinguish between Raman and Rayleigh scattering and fluorescence (Kaiser Optical Systems Inc. 2016; Schrader 2008). By measuring the change in frequency from the incident light, the Stokes shift furnishes a means of measuring the vibrational frequency of a molecular bond. RS identifies the vibrational states of molecules, and it can be used for molecular finger printing and for monitoring changes in molecular bonds. RS has some advantages over traditional vibrational spectroscopy methods, such as FTIR and NIR. The Raman effect involves the light scattered by a sample rather than the light absorbed by the sample. Therefore, RS requires little or no sample preparation and is insensitive to aqueous absorption bands. This fact facilitates the measurement of solids, liquids, and gases directly and through transparent containers such as glass, quartz, and plastic (B&wtek 2016). Because water has a weak Raman scattering effect, spectra can be obtained in aqueous solution. This fact is especially important for biological samples. Hygroscopic or air-sensitive materials can be sealed in glass containers because the glass does not interfere with Raman scattering. The region from 2.5 to 200 μm can be recorded in a single Virtual energy states\n\nVibrational energy states\n\nInfrared absorption\n\nRayleigh scattering\n\nStokes Raman scattering\n\nAnti-Stokes Raman scattering\n\n4 3 2 1 0\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Jablonski diagram showing the Rayleigh scattering, Stokes scattering, and anti-Stokes Raman scattering.

More recently, techniques involving reflectance of midrange IR and NIR radiation have been developed and share some of these advantages. Because RS detects fundamental vibrations, Raman bands have a good signal-tonoise ratio and are nonoverlapping. It can be used for the analysis of aqueous systems, wide concentration ranges can be used, no sample preparation is necessary, the analysis is nondestructive, it can be used for quantitative determinations, and the measurement times can vary from a fraction of second to a few minutes. This means that RS can be used to monitor reactions in real time (Kaiser Optical Systems Inc. 2016; Schrader 2008). When a laser beam is used to excite the sample, a very small sample is necessary to produce a Raman spectrum. Raman microscopy has been used to study the effect of radiation on cells (Craig Technologies 2016; Harder et al. 2016) and to detect bacteria (Fan et al. 2011). Using the whole spectral range, a better chemical specificity can be obtained, and a wider range of materials can be investigated. The presence of a specific material or unknown material in the sample can be determined. The similarity of materials can be determined by comparing their Raman spectra. Changes in the details of the spectrum (height, width, and position of the bands) can be used to determine the relative amount of material, the thickness of a layer, the crystallinity, the presence of tension in the sample, and variations in these parameters. The distribution of a specific material and the size of particles can also be determined (Craig Technologies 2016). RS has been used to analyze food and pharmaceutical nanomaterials (Li and Church 2014). UV and FT-RS were compared for the determination of conjugated linoleic acids in cow milk fat, and they were found to be equally reliable (Bernuy et al. 2008). IR absorbance is strongest when the absorption of IR radiation leads to a change in dipole moment, as is the case with O–H and N–H bonds. A symmetrical vibration of the CO2 molecule does not result in an IR band, but it does produce a band in the Raman spectrum (Ferraro et al. 2003). The Raman spectrum depends on the polarizability of the molecule, so soft molecules like benzene, with large pi bonds, scatter many photons, whereas small, hard molecules tend to be weak Raman scatterers (Ferraro et al. 2003). A vibration can be active in the IR spectrum, active in RS or both. Symmetrical vibrations are always active in RS, and bending vibrations are generally weaker than stretching vibrations. Measurements of depolarization ratios can provide information regarding the symmetry of a normal vibration (Ferraro et al. 2003). RS can be enhanced by making the virtual excited level a real excited level. The molecule is irradiated with an excitation frequency whose energy corresponds to the electronic transition of a specific chromophore in the molecule. The Raman bands for this chromophore are enhanced by a factor of 103 –105 (Ferraro et al. 2003). The frequency of the vibrations in the chromophore, and the location of the electronic transition in the absorption spectrum can be determined. However, this resonance enhancement is only observed in molecules possessing vibrations that can be resonantly enhanced, and as such, this approach is limited to certain chemicals (Kaiser Optical Systems Inc. 2016). Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a Raman spectroscopic technique that provides a greatly enhanced Raman signal from Raman-active analyte molecules that have been adsorbed onto certain specially prepared metal surfaces (Hicks 2001). It increases the intensity of the Raman signal on the order of 104 –106, and the increase can be as high as 108 –1014 for some systems (Kneipp et al. 1999; Moskovits 1985). SERS is both surface selective and highly sensitive. In normal RS, the photons of the incident laser light simply propagate through the bulk, and the signal from the bulk overwhelms any Raman signal from the analytes at the surface. SERS selectivity of the\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n17\n\nsurface signal results from the presence of surface enhancement (SE) mechanisms only at the surface. Thus, the surface signal overwhelms the bulk signal, making bulk subtraction unnecessary. There are two principal mechanisms of enhancement: electromagnetic enhancement (EME) and chemical enhancement. The electromagnetic effect is dominant (Kambhampati et al. 1998). The EME is dependent on the presence of roughness in the surface features of the metal. The structural and molecular identification power of RS can be used for numerous interfacial systems, including electrochemical, modeled, and actual biological systems; catalytic, in-situ, and ambient analyses; and other adsorbate– surface interactions (Garrell 1989; Kneipp et al. 1999; Weaver et al. 2000; Zou et al. 1998). Detection of trace molecules can also be achieved (Kneipp et al. 1999). SERS is observed primarily for analytes adsorbed onto gold, silver, copper, or alkali (Li, Na, K) metal surfaces and when the excitation wavelength is near or within the visible region (Garrell 1989). The importance of SERS is that the surface selectivity and sensitivity extends the RS utility to a wide variety of interfacial systems previously inaccessible to RS because RS is not surface sensitive. These include in-situ and ambient analysis of electrochemical, catalytic, biological, and organic systems (Campion and Kambhampati 1998; He et al. 2008; Kneipp et al. 1999; Weaver et al. 2000; Zhoa et al. 2004; Zou et al. 1998). Alternative surface techniques are discussed by Zou et al. (1998). SERS can be conducted under ambient conditions, has a broader wavenumber range, is quite sensitive, and is surface selective. As with the other spectroscopic methods, Raman instruments have been adapted for remote analysis and for analysis in the field. NASA has Raman spectrophotometers intended for analysis on other planets (Jet Propulsion Laboratory [Caltech] 2016).\n\n1.6 NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE NMR spectroscopy was the last of the principal spectroscopy techniques to be developed, but it is a field that has progressed very rapidly, and innovations in instrumentation and techniques have appeared at a rate that is difficult to accompany. It is based on the magnetic properties of nuclei that were proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1924 (Thomas 1991). The first effective NMR experiments were described by Block and Purcell in 1946 (Thomas 1991). The first spectrum of an organic compound (ethanol) was recorded by Packard and coworkers in 1951, and the first commercial instrument, the HR-30, was produced by Varian in 1953 (Thomas 1991). Soon, instruments became more powerful. Varian produced the A-60 in 1962, and NMR began to be widely used for the analysis of organic compounds. Later came the TA-60, which was intended for use as a teaching instrument. It had a permanent magnet and was capable of computer-averaged scans to reduce the effect of noise on the spectrum. Then came the Varian EM-360, a low-cost, continuous-wave instrument. Other companies, such as Perkin-Elmer, JOEL, and Brüker, also began to produce NMR instruments. Initially, only the spectra of hydrogen atoms were feasible. It took several hours to obtain a 13C-NMR spectrum. With the incorporation of superconducting magnets and pulse irradiation of the nuclei, the resolution and sensitivity of the instruments greatly increased. The Fourier transform method and the possibility of pulsing the sample and more rapidly obtaining the spectra meant that smaller samples could be analyzed. Proton decoupling facilitated the analysis of the 13C spectrum. Carbon-13 spectra became much more accessible, and 2D correlation experiments began to be developed. The expected chemical shifts of hydrogen and carbon-13 could be calculated quite accurately,\n\n18\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\nespecially those of carbon-13. Probes for the analysis of solids, phosphorus-31, nitrogen-15, and fluorine-19 greatly amplified the field for the use of NMR. A French research instrument has been constructed that can generate a magnetic field of 23.5 T and reach a resonance frequency (RF) of 1000 MHz for hydrogen atoms (Chambaud 2016). The nucleus spins on its axis and generates a magnetic moment because of its charge. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the magnetic moments of all the nuclei of a certain type of atom, such as hydrogen, are oriented randomly, and the nuclei have the same energy. In the presence of an external magnetic field (B0), however, a small percentage of the magnetic moments of the nuclei become oriented in the same direction as the external field. Like a spinning top, precession of the axis of the spinning nucleus occurs. When the nuclei are irradiated with electromagnetic energy of the same frequency as the precession, they are promoted from the ground state (spin quantum number +1/2) to a higher energy state (spin quantum number −1/2) in which the magnetic moment is opposite that of the external field and absorption of energy (resonance) occurs. A stronger external field results in a larger difference in the two energy levels (Figure 1.5). The electrons around the nucleus also revolve and generate a magnetic moment contrary to the external field and “protect” the nucleus. If an electron-withdrawing group is bound to the hydrogen atom, its effect will be to reduce the electron density around the nucleus, and a lower external field will be necessary for the nucleus to “feel” the same effective field. Thus, the atom is said to be deprotected, and the transition to the higher energy state occurs at a field strength lower that of the protected nucleus. In addition to the external field, the nucleus also feels the magnetic fields generated by the neighboring hydrogen nuclei. This fact leads to the splitting of the signal in accordance with the n+1 rule, which depends on the number of chemically equivalent neighboring nuclei. This effect of neighboring hydrogen atoms is normally transmitted via the sigma bonds and is called spin–spin coupling, but it can also be transmitted directly through space when the neighboring atoms are close to one another via the phenomenon called the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) (Overhauser 1953; Silverstein and Webster 1998). The through-bond 2D correlation experiments that were developed included 1H-1H COSY (correlation spectroscopy), double-quantum filtered 1H-1H COSY, HETeronuclear chemical shift CORrelation or 1H-13C COSY (HETCOR), proton-detected HETCOR (HMQC), proton-detected, long-range 1H-13C heteronuclear correlation (HMBC) and Incredible Natural Abundance DoublE QUAntum Transfer Experiment(INADEQUATE). These correlations include coupling of the carbon atom with neighboring hydrogen nuclei.\n\nEnergy\n\nms = – 1/2 ΔE = E – 1/2 – E + 1/2 ms = + 1/2 B0 = 0\n\nB0 ≠ 0\n\nMagnetic field\n\nFIGURE 1.5 Diagram showing the variation in energy levels of hydrogen nuclei with an increase in external magnetic field (B0), which leads to a corresponding increase in resolution; ms is the spin quantum number, which describes the angular momentum of the nucleus. (From Brown, J. B. 2014. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Nuclear_magnetic_resonance.)\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n19\n\nThere are short-range and long-range couplings that can provide information on the molecular structure. For homonuclear nuclei that are not directly coupled, but are within the same spin system, there are TOtally Correlated SpectroscopY (TOCSY) and Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY (NOESY) experiments that can be utilized (Silverstein and Webster 1998). In addition, there are techniques such as magic angle spinning solid-phase NMR and 3D spectroscopy, which involves a combination of techniques such as NOESY and HSQC or TOCSY and HSQC. NMR spectroscopy involving 15N has been very useful for determining the conformation of proteins (Schirra 1996), especially in combination with 3D spectroscopy. Spectroscopy involving 31P can provide information regarding the environment of phospholipids and membranes (McLaughlin et al. 1975). Formerly, all chemical shifts were calculated using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the standard. This meant that the solvent usually had to be of low polarity to dissolve the TMS. The solvents could not have hydrogen in the molecule so carbon tetrachloride or deuterated solvents had to be used. Spectra obtained on aqueous solutions were more complicated. Water-soluble standards—4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid, trimethylsilyl propionate, and 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-ammonium trifluoroacetate (Nowick et al. 2003)—are now available for use in aqueous solutions. A large number of studies have been performed on the structure of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules, such as carbohydrates (Battistel et al. 2014), using liquid state and solid-state NMR. The problem with the study of the conformation of macromolecules in solution is that the effects are averaged out by the Brownian motion of the molecules. In the solid state, the movement of the molecules is very limited and interactions within the molecules can more easily be identified. A problem that existed with spectra of molecules in the solid state was the fact that the signals were very wide. This problem has been resolved by the technique called magic-angle spinning, and many studies of proteins in the solid state have been performed (Castellani et al. 2002; Schuanda and Ernst 2016; Zeeb and Balbach 2004; Shahid et al. 2012; Wang and Ladizhansky 2014). A combination of liquid-state and solid-state NMR spectroscopy has also been studied (Carlon et al. 2016; Felli and Pierattelli 2015). NMR spectroscopy has been used for the study of the relationship of the molecular motion of enzymes and their functions (Lisi and Loria 2016; Furukawa et al. 2016; Knight et al. 2011). Solid-state NMR and 15 N- and 31P-NMR spectroscopies have been used to obtain information regarding the structure of membranes (Shahid et al. 2012; Bechinger and Sizun 2003; Hansen et al. 2015). NMR has been used for the study of the effect of diet on metabolism and metabolites (van Duynhoven and Jacobs 2016; Fan and Lane 2016). Information regarding the structure of macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA has been obtained through the use of isotope labeling (Nelissen et al. 2016; Linser et al. 2008) and time-resolved NMR studies (Fürtig et al. 2007). Experiments that utilize the automatic assigning of resonance signals to side chains of proteins have been developed (Gossert et al. 2011). There have been many studies of food products involving NMR spectroscopy for the purpose of determining the chemical composition and the identification of the structure of functional components in foods, determination of composition and formulation of packaging materials, detection of food fraud, optimization of food processing parameters, and inspection of the microbiological, physical, and chemical quality of foods (Marconea et al. 2013). For example, it has been used to detect the presence of adulteration or defects in the product, as in the analysis of honey (Ohmenhaeuser et al. 2013; Schwarzinger et al. 2015) or the determination of mono- and diglycerides in olive oil (Spyros and Dais 2000). The use\n\n20\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\nof NMR in combination with chemometric techniques has been useful for the determination of adulteration of food on the basis of fat contents (Monakhova et al. 2013). Many of these studies have involved high-resolution NMR spectroscopy (Mannina et al. 2012). However, there is also a tendency to develop smaller, less powerful, and more portable instruments for specific analyses. Low-field benchtop and portable instruments with a 60- or 90-MHz RF are commercially available. The objective of these instruments is to permit the analysis of substances online or in the field instead of having to separate a sample and transport it to wherever the instrument is located. The second objective is to analyze a sample without damaging or otherwise modifying it. Resonance imaging has also been shown to be useful for examining large volumes without the necessity to open the package (Schmidt et al. 1996). Studies have evolved on the development of palm-sized and one-sided Halbach magnets (Patel 2010; Danieli et al. 2009; Windt et al. 2011). Flow cells have been developed to allow the analysis of solutions directly during the production process (Nanalysis Corp 2016).\n\n1.7 ULTRASOUND SPECTROSCOPY Ultrasound is sound of a frequency beyond that which the human ear can perceive. Ultrasound can be of low energy or high energy. High-energy ultrasound is disruptive and can be useful for the processing of foods. Low-energy ultrasound has frequencies higher than 100 kHz at intensities below 1 W·cm 2 and can be used to obtain information regarding the physical composition of the product (Awad et al. 2012). It can be used for noninvasive analysis and monitoring of various food materials during processing and storage. Ultrasound has been used to determine the properties of liquid foods, such as suspended colloids or the presence of particles. Information regarding food properties can be obtained through the packaging, which facilitates the noninvasive control of products during production and storage. Sound propagates through food materials as mechanical waves, causing alternating compressions and decompressions (Blitz 1963, 1971). These ultrasound waves have characteristic wavelengths, velocity, frequency, pressure, and period. The interaction of sound waves with matter alters both the velocity and attenuation of the sound waves via absorption, scattering mechanisms, or both (Awad et al. 2012). The ultrasound velocity in the solid form of a material is greater than that in the liquid form. Ultrasound velocity is very sensitive to molecular organization and intermolecular interactions, which make ultrasound velocity measurements (UVMs) suitable for determining the composition, structure, physical state, and molecular organization (Buckin et al. 2002; Buckin et al. 2003) of fats, emulsions and solid lipid nanoparticles (Awad 2004; Awad et al. 2001; Maleky et al. 2007; Martini et al. 2005a; Povey et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2004), and detection of foreign bodies and defects in processed and packaged food (Hæggström and Luukkala 2001; Leemans and Destain 2009). The attenuation of the coefficient and acoustic impedance correlate with many physicochemical properties of materials. Attenuation is caused by the energy loss in compression and decompression in waves as a result of absorption and scattering (Buckin et al. 2002). Attenuation is affected by viscosity, compressibility, wall material, and scattering and adsorption effects (Povey 1997), which furnish information regarding the physicochemical properties of food materials such as molecular relaxation, microstructure, phase composition, bulk viscosity and rheology (Dukhin and Goetz 2009; Dukhin et al. 2005; McClements 1995), kinetics of reactions, droplet size and stability in emulsions (Buckin et al. 2002), and manufacturing processes, which might be useful in quality\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n21\n\ncontrol assurance of some products. Acoustic impedance is the product of density and sound velocity passing through the boundary of different materials, and it affects the reflection coefficient for boundaries between materials (Awad et al. 2012). The techniques used in ultrasonic measurements are the pulse-echo, continuous wave, pitch-catch, and process tomography (Awad et al. 2012). Ultrasound has been used in genetic improvement programs of cattle (Crews and Kemp 2002; Stelzleni et al. 2002); for determining sheep carcass composition (Silva et al. 2006), solid fat content of chicken fat (Chanamai and McClements 1999), the relationship between ultrasonic properties of fish and their compositions (Ghaedian et al. 1998; Ghaedian et al. 1997; Sigfusson et al. 2001), and the composition of raw meat mixtures (Benedito et al. 2001). It has also been used for monitoring structural deterioration of fish tissue during postmortem (Ghaedian et al. 1997) and for characterizing and classifying back fat from swine of different breeds and feeding regimes by comparing their melting behaviors and solid/liquid fat contents (Niñoles et al. 2007). There are difficulties in the evaluation of the tissue of fruits and vegetables because of the voids and pores present that cause scattering of the ultrasound waves (McClements and Gunasekaran 1997; Povey 1989). However, correlations have been obtained for the maturity (Mizrach et al. 1991), the firmness (Mizrach 2007), the sugar content (Contreras et al. 1992), and the viscosity (Kuo et al. 2008) of fruits and fruit juice. Ultrasound spectroscopy has also been used for the determination of oil composition, purity, and quality (Sankarappa et al. 2005) and for the detection of defective potatoes (Cheng and Haugh 1994). Ultrasound spectroscopy has been used for evaluating the extent of mixing of flour dough systems (Ross et al. 2004), fermentation of the dough during bread making (Skaf et al. 2009), and the texture of bakery products (Petrauskas 2007). It is also useful for determining the crispness of biscuits and similar products (Povey and Harden 1981; Povey 1989). Ultrasound spectroscopy is useful for determining online the hardness of products that have large proportions of fat such as margarine, chocolate, and butter (Martini et al. 2005b). It is also valuable for evaluating oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions (Coupland and McClements 2001). Changes in the physical properties of honey because of adulteration were shown to be accompanied by changes in ultrasound velocity (Singh and Dwivedi 1995). The progress of tofu ripening can be determined by measuring the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation (Ting et al. 2009). Ultrasound spectroscopy has also been used for the control of the gelation behavior of different carrageenan systems (Wang et al. 2005). Ultrasound spectroscopy is used for estimating protein hydration, solubility, foaming capacity, flexibility, compressibility, and volume (Guzey et al. 2004; Povey et al. 1999) and to monitor the changes that occur during the freezing of food (Martino et al. 1998; Sigfusson et al. 2004).\n\n1.8 MULTIVARIATE AND CHEMOMETRIC ANALYSES Much of the progress in food spectroscopy is due to the improvement in the instruments and techniques utilized for the analyses. However, a very large portion of the progress has been the result of chemometric and multivariate mathematical methods, without which there would be no way of interpreting the data obtained from NIR, diffuse reflectance, and RS. Because of these two factors, much smaller samples can be used than could previously be analyzed. And noninvasive methods can be used so that results can be obtained much faster during the production process or remotely.\n\n22\n\nDavid Lee Nelson\n\nChemometrics involves the manipulation of information from chemical systems. It is interdisciplinary and uses methods employed by multivariate statistics, applied mathematics, and computer science. It is used to solve descriptive and predictive problems in experimental sciences, especially in chemistry. The datasets can be very large and complex. Chemometrics is particularly applicable to the evaluation of the data sets obtained in NIR and reflectance spectroscopy. The limiting factor is usually the standards used to define the parameters to be measured (Varmuza and Filzmoser 2009). Chemometrics can make use of the methods of classification, pattern recognition, clustering, multivariate curve resolution, experimental design, signal processing, performance characterization and figures of merit, multivariate statistical process control, and multiway methods (Brereton 2013). According to Bu (2016), the spectroscopist requires the following methods: principal component analysis (PCA), regression (partial least squares [PLS], principal component regression [PCR], multiple linear regression [MLR], and 3-way PLS) and prediction (Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy [SIMCA] and partial least square discriminant analysis [PLS-DA] classification). The early work on the development of the correlation of variables was performed by statisticians. Later work was performed by programmers. Chemometrics is widely used for a multitude of purposes because of the softwares that have been developed. However, most of the users do not really understand the principles involved. Brereton (2013) says that the number of chemometricians is decreasing so there will be fewer people who can develop new methods of analysis. Multivariate analysis is a method for summarizing the data in a form that can be more easily interpreted. One of the methods used is PCA or factor analysis, and it facilitates the identification of patterns, such as groups, trends, and so on, in the data. Another type of analysis is called classification or discriminant analysis. This method analyzes the groups and how they differ. Multiple regression analysis or PLS is a method that evaluates relationships between columns in a data table, and the objective is to use one set of variables to predict another set for the purpose of optimization of the parameters. The analyses are performed by computer programs that perform the operation involving PCA, multivariate curve resolution, PLS regression, 3-way PLS regression, clustering (K-means), SIMCA, and PLS-DA classification. Data models are prepared for faster product and process optimization for applications in spectroscopy, product development, quality control, and process analytical technology (Varmuza and Filzmoser 2009). The classification methods include two types of methods. The supervised methods are composed of the naive Bayes classifier, the J48 decision trees, and the support vector machines. The unsupervised methods involve the sense clusters (an adaptation of the K-means clustering algorithm) (Padhy 2016). Four methods of quantification were proposed by Hayashi (1950, 1952, 1954, 1961). There are two methods for the case with an external criterion for prediction or analysis of the effects of factors. In the first method, the external criterion is observed quantitatively to maximize the correlation coefficient. In the second method, the external criterion is observed qualitatively to maximize the correlation ratio. There are also two methods for the case with no external criterion of prediction or analysis of the effects of factors. In the first method, the response patterns of subjects on some attributes are given, and the correlation coefficient between the subjects and the categories is maximized. In the second method, similarities between subjects are observed quantitatively, and the objective function is maximized (Tanaka 1979).\n\nIntroduction to Spectroscopy\n\n23\n\n1.9 CONCLUSION There have been several advances in spectroscopy in the near-IR to UV–Vis region that are valuable for biomedical applications (Coffey 2013a). These techniques can also be useful for the analysis of food. The techniques are noninvasive and do not use ionizing radiation. In addition, data manipulation and interpretation of spectroscopic imaging permits the identification of features that would otherwise be unidentifiable, including the use of graphics processing unit (GPU)-based manipulation (Mayerich et al. 2013). The advances in the use of off-the-shelf spectroscopy components, new techniques of data sampling and analysis, and methods of data manipulation can reduce the time and cost of analysis. Portable instruments and the methods that have been and are being developed facilitate the analysis in the field and in-line because they reduce the need for manipulation of the sample. Cost-effective methods can also facilitate analyses in developing countries that do not have the funds to purchase and maintain expensive equipment (Coffey 2013b; Milton et al. 2009; Das et al. 2016). The control and analysis of the compositions of the raw materials and the finished products, the control of the shelf life during storage, and the determination of the existence of toxic components can be performed in research and production centers distributed throughout the country that cannot afford expensive equipment. Advancements in spectroscopic technology and mathematical techniques show great promise for the control of food quality.\n\nREFERENCES Abe, H., S. Kawano, K. Takehara, and M. Iwamoto. 1996.
