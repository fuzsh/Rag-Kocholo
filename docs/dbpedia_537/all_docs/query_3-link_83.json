New principles for instrumentation have provided cutting-edge developments within NIR imaging, handheld instruments and laser-based techniques. As with the ﬁeld of data analysis in general, NIR spectral analysis and data treatments also continue to demonstrate prominent advancements that only accelerate in its scope and accomplishments. We now have instruments available that are capable of generating very high volumes of high-quality spectral data, in breath-taking speeds, perhaps even distributed over several online measurement points, and terms such as artiﬁcial intelligence, big data and deep learning are more and more commonly seen as the tools used to decipher the hidden information in the spectral data. All these advances open the pathways for the introduction of quantum chemistry to NIR spectroscopy—a decoding and understanding for modelling chemical systems based on quantum theory. It is now possible to imagine applications that use a combination of NIR spectroscopy with information and communication technology, applications that uses low-power and remote-sensing laser NIR spectroscopy, or devices incorporated in handheld instruments—maybe even embedded in our mobile phones—all of which is contributing to some artiﬁcial intelligent-assisted model to improve, for instance, food quality and safety for the individual consumer. The possibilities of NIRS technology seem to be endless! Several textbooks and handbooks on NIR spectroscopy are currently available; they are all important books, but some of them are not up to date. We thus thought there was an increasing demand for a new state-of-the-art textbook on NIR spectroscopy. The present book, we hope, will ﬁll the gap and ﬁnd a wide audience of newcomers as well as experts to the exciting and versatile NIR spectroscopy technology. The book is intended as a go-to-book for background theory, applications and tutorial work. It consists of four major parts: Introduction and Principles, Spectral Analysis and Data Treatments, Instrumentation, and Applications. We attempted to prepare a well-balanced book with emphasis on underlying principles, spectral analysis and data treatments and at the same time cover almost all areas to which NIR spectroscopy is currently applied. v\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nThe contributors, from many countries, are all front-runners in modern vibrational spectroscopy, data analysis, instrumentation and/or applications. Another purpose of this book is making a strong bridge between molecular spectroscopists and researchers and engineers in various ﬁelds such as agriculture and food engineering, pharmaceutical engineering, polymer engineering, process engineering and biomedical sciences. We intend the book to become a valuable source for molecular spectroscopists who are interested in new applications of NIR spectroscopy and for researchers and engineers in a variety of ﬁelds who would like to study basic principles of molecular spectroscopy and NIR spectroscopy in particular. Finally, it is our strong hope that this book will be useful for graduate science and engineering students where it can serve as inspiration as textbook for courses and seminars of graduate schools. Last but not least, we would like to thank Dr. Shinichi Koizumi, Mr. Tony Pressler Sekar and Ms. Taeko Sato of Springer Nature, for their continuous efforts in publishing this exciting book.

The discovery of infrared region is mentioned first, and then, the definition of NIR region and characteristics of NIR spectroscopy are explained. Finally, the brief history of NIR spectroscopy is outlined. Keywords Near-infrared · NIR · Vibrational spectroscopy · Electronic spectroscopy\n\n1.1 Discovery of Infrared (IR) Region The discovery of an invisible component beyond the red end of the solar spectrum (modern meaning-infrared (IR) region in a broad sense) is ascribed to William Herschel, a German-born British astronomer, who is famous for Herschel telescope. In 1800 one day, he investigated the effect of sunlight divided from violet to red by a prism on temperature increase. He used just sunlight, a prism, and thermometers. Figure 1.1 shows his portrait and the experimental set up he employed. He happened to find that the significant temperature increase occurred even outside of red. He thought there was a different kind of invisible radiation from visible light beyond the red end of sunlight and named this radiation “heat ray.” This was really a great discovery in science, but even he could not imagine that this is light. He was 62 years old when he discovered “heat ray.” Sixty-two years old in 1800 probably corresponds to today’s 80 years old or so. Thus, his discovery demonstrated that even very senior scientist could have intensive serendipity.\n\nY.

Huck\n\nFig. 1.1 The portrait of William Herschel and his experimental set up in 1800\n\nInterestingly enough, just one year after the discovery of “heat ray,” Johann Ritter, a German scientist found another invisible component beyond the violet end of the solar spectrum based on an experiment of blackening of silver chloride. In this way, a new era of light was opened at the turning point from the eighteenth century to the nineteenth century. After the discovery of “heat ray,” many scientists investigated it. In 1835, it was confirmed that “heat ray” is invisible light which has longer wavelength than visible light. He named this light “infrared (IR).” Maxwell elucidated theoretically in 1864 that ultraviolet, visible, and IR light are all electromagnetic wave. In 1888, Hz proved it experimentally.\n\n1.2 Introduction to NIR Spectroscopy IR region is so wide energetically, ranging from 150 to 0.12 kJ mol−1 (12,500– 10 cm−1 ). If one compares the energy of the highest wavenumber end of NIR region with that of the lowest wavenumber end of far-IR (FIR) region, one can find that the difference in the energy between the two ends is more than 1000 times. Therefore, nowadays, the IR region is divided into three regions, NIR region (12,500–4000 cm−1 ; 800–2500 nm), the IR region (mid-IR; 4000–400 cm−1 ; 2500– 25,000 nm), and the far-IR region (FIR; 400–10 cm−1 ; 25 μm-1 mm) [1–7]. NIR spectroscopy is spectroscopy in the region of 12,500–4000 cm−1 , where bands arising from electronic transitions as well as those due to overtones and combinations\n\n1 Introduction\n\n5\n\nof normal vibrational modes are expected to appear [1–7]. Therefore, NIR spectroscopy is electronic spectroscopy as well as vibrational spectroscopy. Ultraviolet (UV)-visible (Vis) spectroscopy is electronic spectroscopy while infrared (IR) spectroscopy is vibrational spectroscopy, so that NIR spectroscopy is something special. It lies in between electronic spectroscopy region and vibrational spectroscopy region. Figure 1.2 shows chemical structure of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) material and NIR spectra in the region of 10,000–4000 cm−1 of 32 kinds of IMAC materials [8]. Broad features in the 10,000–7500 cm−1 region are due to the d-d transition of Ni coordination compound and bands in the 7500– 4000 cm−1 region arise from overtones and combinations. The spectra in Fig. 1.2 are very interesting examples, demonstrating that in the NIR region, one can observe both bands assigned to electronic transition and those originating from vibrational transitions. Most of the electronic transitions appearing in the NIR region are the d-d transitions, charge-transfer (CT) transitions, and π-π* transitions of large, or long, conjugated systems [1, 3, 7]. NIR spectroscopy involves absorption, emission, scattering, reflection, and diffuse-reflection of light [1–7]. NIR spectroscopy together with Raman, IR, and Terahertz/FIR spectroscopy forms “four sisters of vibrational spectroscopy.” Since NIR spectroscopy is concerned\n\nFig. 1.2 Chemical structure of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) material and NIR spectra in the region of 10,000–4000 cm−1 of 32 kinds of IMAC materials.

Huck\n\nonly with overtones and combination modes as a vibrational spectroscopy, it is very much unique compared with Raman, IR, and Terahertz/FIR spectroscopy. The NIR region can be divided into three regions; Region I (800–1200 nm; 12,500– 8500 cm−1 ), Region II (1200–1800 nm; 8500–5500 cm−1 ), and Region III (1800– 2500 nm; 5500–4000 cm−1 ) [1–7]. The boarders of the three regions are not rigorous. In Region I, bands arising from electronic transitions and those due to higher-order overtones and various types combination modes are expected to appear. Region I shows high transparency because all the bands appearing in this region are very weak, allowing biomedical applications and applications to agricultural products. Region I is the region where CCD cameras work very well, and this region is called “window of biological materials” because of high transparency to body. It has also a few more nick names: “the short-wave NIR (SWNIR) region,” ”near NIR (NNIR) region,” or “the Herschel region.” Region II is a region for the first and second overtones of the XH (X = C, O, N) stretching vibrations and various types of combination modes. Region III contains mainly bands attributed to the combination modes except for the second overtone of the C = O stretching vibrational mode. It shows poorer “permeability.” NIR spectroscopy, particularly vibrational NIR spectroscopy, is spectroscopy of anharmonicity [1–7]. The overtones and combination modes are the so-called forbidden transitions for a harmonic potential, yielding very weak bands. Both the frequencies and intensities of NIR bands are controlled by anharmonicity. Therefore, investigations on overtones and combination modes, anharmonicity, vibrational potential, and dipole moment function regarding NIR spectroscopy are important. However, these studies have been far behind applications of NIR spectroscopy probably because until 1990s, it was difficult to obtain accurate NIR spectra and to make reliable band assignments. It is only recent that quantum chemistry has been introduced to studies of frequencies and intensities of overtones and combination bands (Chap. 5). The fact that bands in the NIR region are weak or very weak is what makes this region unique and markedly different from the other regions [1–7]. The reason why the NIR region is valuable in various applications is because only the NIR region serves as a highly transmitting window to radiation thanks to anharmonicity.\n\n1.3 Brief History of NIR Spectroscopy It is uncertain when NIR spectroscopy began, but there is the report that Abney and Festing measured the spectra of some simple organic compounds in the 700–1200 nm region as well as in the Vis and IR regions. In the beginning of the twentieth century, main concerns of molecular spectroscopy were UV–Vis and IR spectroscopy. It was 1920s and 30s that systematic measurements of NIR spectra were carried out. A chance came from the development of a spectrometer by Brackett. In 1930s, spectroscopists already recognized that NIR spectra arise from overtones and combination modes [9, 10]. In 1950s, NIR spectroscopy received considerable interest for\n\n1 Introduction\n\n7\n\nhydrogen bonding studies and studies on anharmonicity [11, 12]. The development of an innovative spectrometer, Carey 14 Applied Physics in 1954, pushed NIR spectroscopy research as well as UV–Vis studies [1]. However, the development of basic studies of NIR spectroscopy was still rather slow because even development of new spectrometers was insufficient for NIR spectroscopy to observe weak NIR bands accurately, and also systematic analysis of NIR bands was very difficult. Moreover, NIR spectroscopy could not find application fields not only in basic science but also in practical applications [1–7]. Until 1960s, NIR spectroscopy was a “sleeping giant” in terms of both basic science and applications. It was not a spectroscopist but an engineer in an agricultural field who woke up the sleeping giant. He was Karl Norris (Fig. 1.3a) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Norris learnt electrical engineering as well as agricultural engineering at universities, and thus, he had good background for developing spectrometers and systems with computers. Norris was involved in a research of drying grain by use of infrared technology. He happened to find that the grain had absorbances in the NIR region. He focused on the fact that NIR spectroscopy is suitable for nondestructive analysis, and he and his colleagues tried to use NIR spectroscopy for quality assessments of agricultural products. Norris proposed to use statistical methods to build calibration models from NIR data [13, 14]. First, he employed simple linear regression and then multiple regression. His idea realized the advantages of NIR spectroscopy in practical applications. Thus, Norris is called “Father of NIR spectroscopy.” Norris, Phil Williams, Fred McClure, and other engineers applied NIR spectroscopy to many applications in agriculture and then foods. Beltsville (Maryland, USA) was a place for assemblage for the bold and ambitious. Their great success partly came from the strong request of quality assessment from consumers which already started in North America from 1960s and partly from the development of spectrometers and computers. However, many conventional spectroscopists did not accept adamantly the eccentric idea of utilizing statistical methods such as multiple regression analysis to develop calibration models of NIR data. After rather long dispute, some traditional spectroscopists started to recognize the usefulness of the statistical methods to analyze NIR spectra. Particularly, Tomas Herschfeld played a very important role in making a bridge between the spectroscopists and agricultural engineers. Of note is that in 1960s, there was significant progress also in the applications of NIR spectroscopy to basic studies [15–17]. For examples, in 1963, Bujis and Choppin [17] measured NIR spectra of pure water and investigated water structure in relation to hydrogen bonds. Late 1960s and early 70s, a few research groups including Camille Sandorfy (Fig. 1.3b) group [16] found very interesting fact concerning with the relative intensities of free and association bands of the OH and NH stretching bands compared for the fundamentals and overtones. The relative intensity of the free band is much greater for the overtones than fundamentals. One can say Sandorfy is a pioneer in basic studies of NIR spectroscopy. He is famous particularly in the research on relation between anharmonicity and hydrogen bondings. It is also very important to know that there is another great scientist who advanced the practical application of NIR spectroscopy. He was Frans, F. Jobsis (Fig. 1.3c),\n\n8 Fig. 1.3 Portrait photos of a Karl H. Norris, b Camille Sandorfy, and c Frans F. Jöbsis\n\nY. Ozaki and C. Huck\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n1 Introduction\n\n9\n\nwho carried out the in vivo monitoring of the redox behavior of cytochrome c oxidase (or cytochrome aa3 ) (Chap. 20) [18]. Since his pioneering study medical application of NIR spectroscopy has shown distinctive growth as described later [19]. It is not clear when chemometrics was born, but it is clear that the use of statistical methods by Norris was one of the initiations of the development of chemometrics [1, 2, 4, 6]. Among various molecular spectroscopy, NIR spectroscopy was the first in using chemometrics. For the last half century or so, chemometrics developed NIR spectroscopy and NIR spectroscopy developed chemometrics. Nowadays, chemometrics is used in almost all kinds of spectroscopy including IR, Raman, far-infrared (FIR)/Terahertz, UV–Vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. In 1980s, NIR spectroscopy was used mainly for agriculture and food engineering fields, but applications to polymers and on-line analysis started in those days. After entering 1990s, application of NIR spectroscopy made remarkable progress thanks to the development of spectrometers, detectors, computers, and chemometrics. It has expanded to chemical, polymer and petroleum industries, pharmaceutical industry, biomedical sciences, environmental analysis, and even analysis of cultural resources. In the last ten years or so, development of NIR imaging and portable and handheld instruments has been a matter of big attention. Besides progresses in NIR imaging, and portable and hand-held spectrometers, those in on-line monitoring, process analysis technology (PAT), sensing for security and safety, and medical diagnosis have been particularly noted [1–6]. NIR world is stretching strongly over a huge area of science and technology. Medical application of NIR spectroscopy is nowadays called functional NIR (fNIR) spectroscopy [20]. It uses mainly electronic NIR spectroscopy in Region 1, the region of “window of biological materials.” fNIR is applied not only to medical applications but also to brain research. Basic studies of NIR spectroscopy such as overtones, combination modes, anharmonicity, and vibrational potential, and application of NIR spectroscopy to basic science like studies of hydrogen bondings, intermolecular interactions, and solution chemistry experienced “renaissance” in the 1990s due to rapid progress in NIR spectrometers particularly FT-NIR spectrometers and spectral analysis methods like two-dimensional correlation analysis.(Chap. 13) [1, 2, 3, 5, 7] Quantum chemical calculations have realized simulations of NIR spectra not only of simple compounds but also of rather complicated molecules such as long chain fatty acids, caffeine, nucleic acid bases, and rosemaric acid (Chap. 5). They also enable one to make band assignments of NIR spectra [20]. It is noted that quantum chemical calculations are useful for both basic studies and applications of NIR spectroscopy. NIR spectroscopy is expanding markedly to a variety of fields such as astronomy, security and safety sensing, forensic science, building site, paleocultural property science and brain science.\n\n10\n\nY.

It is divided into two subchapters, 2–1. Characteristics and advantages of NIR spectroscopy: In this subchapter some emphasis is put on the versatility of NIR spectroscopy. Some examples of NIR spectra are explained 2–2. Principles of NIR spectroscopy based on quantum mechanics: To understand principles of NIR spectroscopy, principles of IR spectroscopy are described using quantum mechanics first, and then detailed explanation about molecular vibrations-fundamentals, overtones and combinations is given. Anharmonicity is mentioned briefly. Keywords Molecular vibrations · Vibrational spectroscopy · Overtones · Combinations · Anharmonicity NIR spectroscopy has very unique characteristics and advantages in comparison with other spectroscopy like ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), IR, and Raman spectroscopy. Those characteristics and advantages of NIR spectroscopy all come from anharmonicity of vibrational modes. Hence, it is important to learn the characteristics and advantages of NIR spectroscopy in relation with anharmonicity, whose description needs fundamental knowledge of quantum mechanics.\n\nY.

Morisawa\n\n2.1 Characteristics and Advantages of NIR Spectroscopy 2.1.1 Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy NIR spectroscopy is concerned with both electronic transitions and vibrational transitions [1–7]. However, as the electronic spectroscopy, it is not easy or almost meaningless to discriminate the NIR region from the visible region. The two regions are seamless in the electronic spectra. In contrast, it is quite straightforward to distingish the vibrational spectroscopy in the NIR region from that in the IR region because NIR spectroscopy deals only with bands arising from overtones and combination modes, while IR spectroscopy involves mainly bands due to fundamentals, although those originating from overtones and combinations also appear relatively weakly in the IR region. One of the most characteristic features of NIR spectroscopy come from the fact that bands in the NIR region are weak or very weak. Both bands due to electronic transitions and those originating from vibrational transitions are weak. The overtones and combination modes arise from so-called forbidden transitions [1–7]. The reason why the NIR region is valuable from the point of applications is since only the NIR region offers as a highly transmitting window to radiation.\n\n2.1.2 Characteristics of NIR Bands Characteristics of bands appearing in the NIR region can be summarized as follows. Here, we consider NIR vibrational bands, overtones and combinations. (1) Bands observed in the NIR region are all due to overtones and combinations; Not only simple combination bands such as v1 + v2 but also second order and third order combination bands such as v1 + 2v2 appear. The NIR region contains many overlapping bands; NIR bands show strong multicolinearlity. Therefore, assignment of the NIR bands is generally not easy. (2) The NIR bands become weaker and weaker as the wavelength becomes shorter since bands due to higher order overtones and the second and third order combinations appear in the shorter wavelength region. Table 2.1 tabulates the wavelength, wavenumber, and relative intensity of bands due to the fundamental, first, second, and third overtones of CH stretching mode of chloroform. It is noted that the overtone bands become weak abruptly with the increase in the order and that the third overtone bands is located in the Vis region. (3) Most of the bands in the NIR region originate from functional groups containing a hydrogen atom (e.g., OH, CH, NH). This is partly due to the fact that an anharmonic constant of an XH bond is large, and partly due to the fact that an XH stretching vibration has its fundamental in a high frequency region (38002800 cm−1 ). Hence, NIR spectroscopy is often called “an XH spectroscopic\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy Table 2.1 The wavelength, wavenumber, and relative intensity of bands due to the fundamental, first, second, and third overtones of CH stretching mode of chloroform\n\nBand position/nm\n\n13 Band position/cm−1\n\nIntensity/ cm2 mol−1\n\nυ\n\n3290\n\n3040\n\n25000\n\n2υ\n\n1693\n\n5907\n\n1620\n\n3υ\n\n1154\n\n8666\n\n48\n\n4υ\n\n882\n\n11338\n\n1.7\n\n5υ\n\n724\n\n13831\n\n0.15\n\nmethod.” Besides XH vibrational bands, those arising from the second overtones of C = O stretching modes appear in the NIR region. Recently, bands due to the first and second overtones of C ≡ N stretching modes of acetonitrile are also observed [8]. The C = O and C ≡ N stretching bands are two of the most intense bands in the IR region because of their large transition dipole moments, and thus, even second overtones can be observed in the NIR region. (4) The first overtones of XH stretching bands give a lower frequency shift upon the formation of a hydrogen bond or an inter- or intra-molecular interaction as in the cases of the corresponding fundamental bands in IR spectra. The shift of the first overtones is almost double of that for the corresponding IR bands. (5) In the NIR region OH and NH stretching bands of monomeric and polymeric species are much better separated compared with the IR region. It is also possible to distinguish bands ascribed to terminal free OH or NH groups of the polymeric species from those due to their free OH or NH groups in the NIR region. (6) Because of the larger anharmonicity, the first overtone bands of OH and NH stretching modes of monomeric species are much more enhanced compared with the corresponding bands of polymeric species. On the other hand, fundamental bands originating from the OH and NH stretching modes of polymeric species are much more enhanced than those of the monomeric species due to a larger charge separation of X–H (δ− X–Hδ+ —:Y) in a hydrogen bonding. In Fig. 4.8 you can see good example for these phenomena. In the IR spectrum a broad feature due to polymeric species is much stronger than a band originating from monometic species while in the NIR spectrum a truly opposite result is observed (Sect. 4.1.2). Therefore, one can monitor more easily the dissociation process from polymeric species into monomeric ones in the NIR region rather than in the IR region by the first overtone of the OH or NH stretching mode of the monomeric species. Note that almost all of the above characteristics come from the fact that NIR spectroscopy is concerned with forbidden transitions within the harmonic-oscillator approximation.\n\n14\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\n2.1.3 Advantages of NIR Spectroscopy Now, let us discuss the advantages of NIR spectroscopy from the point of applications [1–7]. First of all, NIR spectroscopy is a powerful non-destructive and in situ analysis method. One can explore even inside of a material using NIR spectroscopy. Second, it permits non-contact analysis, and analysis using an optical fiber. Third, it is possible to apply NIR spectroscopy to samples in various states, shapes, and thickness. As for the advantages of NIR spectroscopy for fundamental studies we discuss in Chap. 13. One can discuss the advantages of NIR spectroscopy in comparison with IR spectroscopy. (1) NIR spectroscopy allows in situ analysis with a sample as it originally is. While one can employ attenuated total reflection (ATR) or photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) for in situ analysis in IR spectroscopy, there is no other choice than NIR spectroscopy if one wishes to collect an absorption spectrum on the whole of an apple or a human head. It is also suitable for nondestructive of thick samples. (2) In general, NIR spectroscopy is more suitable in the analysis of aqueous solutions than IR spectroscopy since the intensity of water bands is much weaker in the NIR spectrum than in the IR spectrum. ATR-IR spectroscopy permits one to examine aqueous solutions, but NIR spectroscopy can probe those in more various manners. (3) A light-fiber probe can be set in a dangerous environment, and be remotely manipulated. This is one of the reasons why NIR spectroscopy is suitable for on-line analysis. IR Light-fibers are much less robust and more expensive. (4) In NIR spectroscopy one can select a light path length very freely. In contrast, IR spectroscopy usually requests a cell having a very short path length. NIR spectroscopy allows one to use a 0.1-mm cell, a 1-cm cell, or even a 10-cm cell. (5) Optical materials used in the NIR region are cheaper than those in the IR region. One can use glass cells, for example.\n\n2.1.4 Versatility of NIR Spectroscopy NIR spectroscopy holds marked versatility in many aspects. First of all, it has huge versatility in its applications [1–7]. NIR spectroscopy can be used in a laboratory, a factory, a hospital, a field and a museum, at a building site, on a road and in the atmosphere. It may be applied to solids, crystals, fibers, powders, liquids, solutions, and gases. Almost all kinds of materials, from purified samples to bulk materials, can be subjected to NIR measurements. Another versatility in NIR spectroscopy is the versality in spectrometers and instruments. (Chap. 9) In the IR region, most of the spectrometers employed are FT spectrometers, while in the NIR region both FT spectrometers and dispersive spectrometers are employed, and dispersive spectrometers with a CCD detector play important roles in the short-wave NIR (SWNIR) region. NIR spectrometers with\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\n15\n\nan acoustic optic tunable filter (AOTF) are also useful. Portable spectrometers and hand-held spectrometers are prety popular in the NIR region. Many kinds of specialpurpose instruments are commercially available. Spectral analysis gives yet another diversity of NIR spectroscopy. Compared with other spectroscopy, chemometrics is quite often used for NIR spectral analysis. Various kinds of chemometrics methods such as PCA (principal components analysis) and PLS (partial least squares) are employed extensively (Chap. 7). A variety of spectral pretreatments are employed in NIR spectroscopy, since it treats various kinds of bulk materials, which yield noise and baseline fluctuations (Sect. 4.1). Nowadays, even quantum chemical calculations are utilized in the spectral analysis in NIR spectroscopy (Sect. 5.2).\n\n2.1.5 Some Examples of NIR Spectra To understand the characteristics of NIR spectroscopy it is important to study some examples of NIR spectra. (a) Water Figure 2.1 depicts NIR spectra of water in the region of 12000–4000 cm−1 obtained using three kinds of cells with different path lengths (1, 0.1, and 0.01 cm). Band intensities vary markedly with the path lengths. In all the spectra an intense foot due to the fundamentals of OH stretching modes can be observed near 4000 cm−1 . Water bands become weaker and weaker stepwisely as the wavelength goes to a shorter wavelength. Two strong bands at 5235 and 6900 cm−1 are due to the combination of H-O-H antisymmetric stretching mode (v3 ) and bending mode (v2 ) and that of H-O-H symmetric (v1 ) and antisymmetric (v3 ) stretching modes, respectively (these vibrational modes, see Fig. 2.9). These two bands are very useful for investigating Fig. 2.1 NIR spectra of water in the region of 12000–4000 cm−1 obtained by three kinds of cells with different path lengths (0.01, 0.1, and 1 cm)\n\n16\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\nwater structure and water contents in various materials. Bands at 10613, 8807, and 8762 cm−1 are assigned to 2v1 + v3 , v1 + v2 + v3 , and 2v1 + v2 , respectively. The band at 10613 cm− [1] is valuable for estimating water contents in foods and materials. As you can see here, several bands attributed to the second and third order combination modes appear in the short wavelength region. More detailed analysis of water spectra will be discussed in Sect. 4.1.2. (b) Methanol Figure 2.2 depicts an NIR spectrum in the 7700–3700 cm−1 region of low concentration (0.005 M, in CCl4 ) methanol. In this concentration it is very unlikely that methanol forms hydrogen bonds. Methanol is a very simple molecule, however, note that it gives so many bands in this region. One can easily assign a band at 7130 cm−1 to the first overtone of the OH stretching mode of free methanol. Bands in the region of 6100–5600 cm−1 are assigned to the first overtones of CH3 symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes and their combinations. Those below 5200 cm−1 are due to various combination modes. We need the aid of quantum chemical calculations for convincing band assignments [9]. We will discuss about the quantum chemical calculation result of methanol in Chap. 13. (c) Inorganic functional material-an example of electronic spectrum Let us show one example of NIR electronic spectra. Figure 2.3a, b depict NIR diffuse-reflectance (DR) spectra in the region of 12000–4000 cm−1 and their secondderivative spectra in the region of 10000–5000 cm−1 of powders of high reflective green-black (HRGB; Co0.5 Mg0.5 Fe0.5 Al1.5 O4 ) pigments, Co3 O4 , and α-Fe2 O3 , respectively [10]. The HRGB pigment developed at Toda Kogyo Co. (Hiroshima,\n\nFig. 2.2 A NIR spectrum in the 7700–3700 cm−1 region of low concentration (0.005 M, CCl4 ) methanol\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\n(a) 2.0\n\nDR absorbance = -log (I/I0)\n\nFig. 2.3 a NIR DR spectra of powders of HRGB, Co3 O4 , and α-Fe2 O3 in the 12000–4000 cm−1 region. b Second derivatives of the NIR DR spectra of powders of HRGB, Co3 O4 and α-Fe2 O3 in the 10000–5000 cm−1 region.

It is noted in the secondderivative spectra that HRGB depicts bands at 6354, 7069, 7590 and 8024 cm−1 and that Co3 O4 , which has a similar spinel structure to HRGB, yields those at 6094, 6713, 7569, 7951, and 8320 cm−1 . The above bands of Co3 O4 are ascribed to d-d transitions, 4 A2 → 4 T 1 , of Co(II) at a tetrahedral cite. A NIR DR spectrum of α-Fe2 O3 gives a long tail band in the region of 12000-10000 cm−1 due to a charge-transfer (CT) transition that has maxima at 17000 and 14000 cm−1 [10]. HRGB shows characteristic peaks of Co(II) in spinel structure, but it does not give a tail originating from Fe(III). In this way one can explore the structure of inorganic functional materials using NIR electronic spectra.\n\n2.1.6 Comparison of an NIR Spectrum with an IR Spectrum Whenever one studies the NIR spectrum of a sample, it is often important to compare the NIR spectrum with the corresponding IR spectrum to interpret the NIR spectrum. Figure 2.4a, b show chemical structure of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and timedependent variations in IR spectra and their second derivative spectra in the 3050– 2850 cm−1 region of a PHB film during the melt-crystallization process at 125 °C,\n\n18\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\nFig. 2.4 Chemical structure and lamellar structure of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). a Timedependent variations in IR spectra in the 3050–2850 cm−1 region of a PHB film during the meltcrystallization process at 125 °C. b Second derivative spectra of the spectra shown in a for 0 and 180 min. Reproduced from Ref. [11] with the permission\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\n19\n\nrespectively [11]. In Fig. 2.4b the second derivative spectra for 0 and 180 min are shown. PHB is a well-known biodegradable polymer. Sato et al. [12, 13] investigated IR spectra of PHB and found that a crystalline C = O stretching band at 1723 cm−1 shows a large downward shift by about 20 cm−1 compared with an amorphous C = O stretching band at 〜1740 cm−1 and that a crystalline CH3 asymmetric stretching band appears at an anomalously high frequency (3009 cm−1 ) [12, 13]. On the basis of the IR and x-ray crystallography studies, they concluded that the CH3 and C = O groups of PHB form a peculiar C–H…O = C hydrogen bonding. Time-dependent variations in the NIR spectra in the 6050–5650 cm−1 region of a PHB film during the melt-crystallization process at 125 °C are shown in Fig. 2.5a [11]. The second derivatives of the spectra measured at 0 and 180 min are shown in Fig. 2.5b. The second-derivative spectrum obtained at 0 min shows four amorphous bands at around 5954, 5913, 5828, and 5768 cm−1 . On the other hand, the spectrum collected at 180 min gives at least seven bands at 5973, 5952, 5917, 5900, 5811, 5757, and 5681 cm−1 in the same region. Note that the NIR spectral changes in the 6050–5650 cm−1 region and the corresponding IR spectral variations in the 3050– 2840 cm−1 region show significant similarities. For example, the NIR band with the highest wavenumber at 5973 cm−1 and the corresponding IR band at 3007 cm−1 show similar temporal variations. The former may be due to the first overtone of the latter [11].

Reproduced from Ref. [11] with the permission\n\n20\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\n2.2 Principles of NIR Spectroscopy Before we study the principle of NIR spectroscopy we have to learn the principle of IR spectroscopy because IR spectroscopy deals with fundamentals while NIR spectroscopy treats overtones and combinations which originate from fundamentals [1, 2]. Therefore, learning the fundamentals is the base for understanding NIR spectroscopy.\n\n2.2.1 Principles of IR Spectroscopy When a molecule is irradiated with IR light, it absorbs the light under some conditions. The energy hν of the absorbed IR light is equal to an energy difference between a certain energy level of vibration of the molecule (having an energy E m ) and another energy level of vibration of a molecule (having an energy E n ). In the form of an equation, hv = E n − E m\n\n(2.1)\n\nholds. This equation is known as Bohr frequency condition. In other words, absorption of IR light takes place based on a transition between energy levels of a molecular vibration. Therefore, an IR absorption spectrum is a vibrational spectrum of a molecule. Note that satisfying Eq. (2.1) does not always mean the occurrence of IR absorption. There are transitions which are allowed by a selection rule (i.e., allowed transition) and those which are not allowed by the same rule (i.e., forbidden transition). In general, transitions with a change in the vibrational quantum number by ± 1 are allowed transitions and other transitions are forbidden transitions under harmonic approximation. This is one of selection rules of IR absorption. Another IR selection rule is a selection rule which is defined by the symmetry of a molecule [1, 2]. (μx )mn =\n\n−∞\n\nψn μx ψm dQ\n\n1 ∂ 2 μx μx = (μx )0 + Q+ Q2 + · · · · · · 2 ∂ Q2 0 0 ∂μx ψn Qψm dQ (μx )mn = (μx )0 ψn ψm dQ + ∂Q 0\n\n∂μx ∂Q\n\n∞\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3) (2.4)\n\nThe latter selection rule is a rule that IR light is absorbed when the electric dipole moment of a molecule varies as a whole in accordance with a molecular vibration. The above two selection rules can be introduced by quantum-mechanical considerations. According to quantum mechanics, for a molecule to transit from a certain\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\n21\n\nstate m to another state n by absorbing or emitting IR light, it is necessary that the following definite integral or at least one of (μy )mn and (μz )mn which are expressed by a similar equation to (2.2) is not 0, where μx denotes an x-component of the electric dipole moment; ψ denotes the eigenfunction of the molecule in its vibrational state; and Q denotes a displacement along a normal coordinate (i.e., a normal vibration expressed as a single coordinate). Now, let us consider only (μx )mn . A distribution of electrons in the ground state changes as the coordinate expressing a vibration varies, and thus, the electric dipole moment is a function of the normal coordinate Q. Hence, μx can be expanded as follows. Expressed by a displacement of atoms during the vibration, Q has a small value. This allows to omit Q 2 and the subsequent terms in the equation above. Substituting the terms up to Q of Eq. (2.3) in Eq. (2.2), is obtained. Due to the orthogonality of the eigenfunction, the first term of this equation is 0 except when m = n holds. The first term denotes the magnitude of the permanent dipole of the molecule. For the second term to have a value other than 0, both (∂μx /∂ Q)0 = 0 and ψ n Q ψ m d Q = 0 must be satisfied. These two conditions lead to the two selection rules. The nature of the eigenfunction allows the integral to have the value other than 0 only when n = m ± 1 holds. Considering Q 2 and the subsequent terms of Eq. (2.3) as well, we can prove that even when n = m ± 1 fails to hold, (μx )mn has a value, even though small, other than 0. The first selection rule regarding IR absorption is thus proved. The other selection rule, which is based upon the symmetry of a molecule, comes from (∂μx /∂ Q)0 = 0. The relationship (∂μx /∂ Q)0 = 0 indicates that IR absorption takes place only when a certain vibration changes the electric dipole moment. The vibration is IR active when (∂μx /∂ Q)0 = 0 holds, but is IR inactive when (∂μx /∂ Q)0 = 0 holds. Most molecules are in the ground vibrational state at room temperature, and thus, a transition from the state ν” = 0 to the state ν” = 1 (first excited state) is possible. Absorption corresponding to this transition is called the fundamental. Although most bands which are observed in an IR absorption spectrum arise from the fundamental, in some cases, also in the IR spectrum one can observe bands which correspond to transitions from the state ν” = 0 to the state ν” = 2, 3,… They are called first, second, overtones. Bands due to combinations are also observed in the IR spectra. However, since overtones and combinations are forbidden with harmonic oscillator approximation, overtone and combination bands are very weak even in real molecules. Because of anharmonicity, although the intensities are weak, the forbidden bands appear.\n\n2.2.2 Molecular Vibrations One must learn molecular vibrations to understand all kinds of vibrational spectroscopy; IR, NIR, FIR/terahertz, and Raman spectroscopy. Vibrations of a polyatomic molecule are, in general, complex, however, according to harmonic oscillator approximation (i.e., an approximation on the assumption that the restoring force\n\n22\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\nwhich restores a displacement of a nucleus from its equilibrium position complies with the Hooke’s law; vibrations in harmonic oscillator approximation are called harmonic vibrations), any vibrations of the molecule are expressed as composition of simple vibrations called normal vibrations. Normal vibrations are vibrations of nuclei within a molecule, and in the normal vibrations, translational motions and rotational motions of the molecule as a whole are excluded. In each normal vibration, all atoms vibrate with the same frequency (normal frequency), and they pass through their equilibrium positions simultaneously. Generally, a molecule with N atoms has 3N–6 normal vibrations (3N–5 normal vibrations if the molecule is a linear molecule). Since normal vibrations are determined by the molecular structure, the atomic weight and the force constant, when these three are known, it is possible to calculate the normal frequencies and the normal modes.\n\n2.2.2.1\n\nA Vibration of a Diatomic Molecule\n\nLet us consider a vibration of a diatomic molecule as the simplest example of molecular vibrations. A diatomic molecule has only one normal mode (3 × 2−5 = 1); it is a stretching vibration where the molecule stretches and contracts (Fig. 2.6a). One can delineate the stretching vibration using classic mechanics. Assuming that the nuclei are masses, m1 and m2 , and the chemical bond is the “spring” with spring constant k following the Hooke’s law (Fig. 2.6b), the vibration of the molecule can be explained in accordance with classic mechanics. The classic mechanical equation of vibration of a diatomic molecule can be solved by a few methods, but here we use a Lagrange’s equation of motion, which is equivalent to Newton’s equation of motion. We assume that the masses m1 and m2 deviate x 1 and x 2 , respectively, from their equilibrium positions. Then, the potential energy of the system shown in Fig. 2.6b is: V =\n\n1 k(χ2 − χ1 )2 2\n\n(2.5)\n\nMeanwhile, the kinetic energy of the system is:\n\nFig. 2.6 a A stretching mode of a diatomic molecule. b A model for a diatomic molecule (two masses combined by a spring)\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\nT =\n\n1 1 dχi m 1 χ˙ 12 + m 2 χ˙ 22 , where χ˙ i = . 2 2 dt\n\n23\n\n(2.6)\n\nNow that V and T are known, motions of the system can be determined by solving a Lagrange’s equation of motion: d dt\n\n∂T ∂ χ˙ i\n\n+\n\n∂V =0 ∂χi\n\n(2.7)\n\nNote that Lagrange’s equation of motion is more convenient in discriminating the translational motion and the vibrational motion. Before solving the Lagrange’s equation of motion, let us introduce new coordinates Q and X Q = χ2 − χ1 m 1 χ1 + m 2 χ2 m1 + m2\n\n(2.9)\n\nm1m2 (where μ is a reduced mass) m1 + m2\n\n(2.10)\n\nX= μ=\n\n(2.8)\n\nNow, Q is a coordinate regarding a displacement of a distance between the two masses, while X is a coordinate regarding a displacement of the center of gravity of the system. Using Q and X, the potential energy V and the kinetic energy T are written as: T =\n\n1 ˙2 1 μ Q + (m 1 + m 2 ) X˙ 2 2 2\n\n(2.11)\n\n1 2 kQ 2\n\n(2.12)\n\nV =\n\nWe substitute V and T in the Lagrange’s equation of motion (2.7). First, applying to the coordinate X (x i = X), we obtain X¨ = 0\n\n(2.13)\n\nThis expresses a free translational motion which is not bounded by the potential energy. On the other hand, from the Lagrange’s equation of motion regarding the coordinate Q (x i = Q), we get μ\n\nd2 Q + kQ = 0 dt 2\n\n(2.14)\n\nFrom the differential equation like Eq. (2.14), we can find a solution as the follows:\n\n24\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\nQ = Q ◦ cos 2π νt\n\n(2.15)\n\nEquation (2.15) implies that the system illustrated in Fig. 2.6b has a simple harmonic motion with the frequency ν and the amplitude Q0 . Substituting Eq. (2.15) in Eq. (2.14), −4π 2 μν 2 + k Q = 0\n\n(2.16)\n\nFinally, we get the frequency of the spring as: 1 ν= 2π\n\nk μ\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe frequency of the spring corresponds to that of the molecular vibration, and the spring constant parallels to the force constant of the chemical bond, and hence, it can be seen from Eq. (2.17) that the frequency of the molecular vibration is proportional to the square root of the force constant and inversely proportional to the square root of the reduced mass of the atoms. It can be seen from Eq. (2.17) that the stronger a chemical bond is and the smaller the masses of atoms are, the larger the stretching frequency of a molecule is. H2 , which has small masses of atoms and relatively small force constant, gives the highest frequency among the all diatomic molecules (4160 cm−1 ). The frequency of a vibrational more higher than 4000 cm−1 is only this one by H2 . This band is not IR active but Raman active, so that it cannot be observed in an IR spectrum. As a result, all bands due to all fundamentals appear below 4000 cm−1 in the IR spectra. This is the reason why 4000 cm−1 is the border between IR and NIR regions.\n\n2.2.2.2\n\nQuantum Mechanical Treatment of a Vibration of a Diatomic Molecule\n\nEnergy levels of vibrations of diatomic molecules can be described using quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the first step is to write down a Schrödinger’s ˆ = EΨ . The second step is to solve the equation to calculate an eigen equation, HΨ value and an eigen function. In terms of classic mechanics, the total energy H of a vibration of a diatomic molecules is the sum of a kinetic energy 1/2μ Q˙ 2 (Eq. 2.11) and a potential energy (1/2)k Q 2 (Eq. 2.12), H =T +V =\n\n1 ˙ 2 μQ + k Q2 2\n\nReplacing Q˙ with an operator -ih/2π・d/d Q, Hˆ is calculated as:\n\n(2.18)\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\nH =−\n\nh2 d 2 1 + k Q2 8π 2 μ dQ 2 2\n\n25\n\n(2.19)\n\nˆ = EΨ and processing the Now, we got Hamiltonian. Substituting this in HΨ formula, a Schrödinger equation on harmonic oscillator of a diatomic molecule is obtained. 1 2 d2 ψ 8π 2 μ E − ψ =0 (2.20) k Q + dQ 2 h2 2 It is not easy to solve this differential equation, but one can do it rigorously. As how to solve this equation is described in detail in a number of textbooks, we will explain only results. Formula 2.20 yields a solution only to the following eigen value Eυ : 1 hν Ev = v + 2\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere ν is a quantum number of a vibration (ν= 0, 1, 2,…). It can be seen from Eq. 2.21 that under the harmonic oscillator approximation, the energies take discreet values and their spacings are equal. Figure 2.7 shows the energy levels of vibration of a diatomic molecule. It is noted that the lowest vibrational energy is not 0 but E 0 = 1/2 hν. E 0 is called zero point energy. Energies have discrete values; E 1 = 3/2 hν, E 2 = 5/2 hν, E 3 = 7/2 hν,…, and an energy difference between adjacent energy levels is always hν. An eigen function to each value of E υ is expressed as:\n\nFig. 2.7 Potential energy curve for a harmonic oscillator and allowed energy levels. a wave functions and b probability density functions of the harmonic oscillator\n\n26\n\nY.

CO2 has 3 × 3−5 = 4 normal vibrations. Figure 2.8 exhibits its four normal modes in CO2 , 1, 2, 3a and 3b. The normal vibrations 1 and 2 are vibrations where two CO bonds stretch and contract in phase (1) and out of phase (2), respectively, called symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching vibrations. Meanwhile, the vibrations 3a and 3b are both vibrations that the angle of OCO changes and called bending vibrations. While the vibrations 3a and 3b are independent of each other, energies required for the vibrations are principally equal Fig. 2.8 Normal modes in CO2 . (+ and – denote vibrations going upward and downward, respectively, in the direction perpendicular to the paper plane). 1, symmetric stretching vibration. 2, antisymmetric stretching vibration. 3a, 3b, degenerate bending vibrations\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\n27\n\nFig. 2.9 Normal modes of vibration of water. 1: symmetric stretching vibration (ν1 ). 2: bending vibration (ν2 ). 3: antisymmetric stretching vibration (ν3 )\n\nto each other, only with planes of the vibrations differing 90 degrees from each other. That is, the two vibrations, 3a and 3b, have exactly the same energy. Such vibrations which have principally the same energy are called degenerate vibrations. To know whether the normal vibrations 1, 2, 3a and 3b are IR active or not, we have to examine a change in the electric dipole moment at an equilibrium position (∂μx /∂ Q)0 . In the normal vibration 1, the electric dipole moment is always 0. Hence, the normal vibration 1 is IR inactive. Conversely, the electric dipole moment largely changes in the normal vibration 2, and thus, it is IR active. In a similar manner, the normal vibrations 3a and 3b accompany a change in the electric dipole moment, and therefore, are IR active. By the way, with respect to a molecule such as a CO2 molecule which has the center of symmetry, a general rule holds true that an IR active vibration is a Raman inactive and a Raman active vibration is IR inactive. This rule is called the mutual exclusion rule. Water, being a nonlinear triatomic molecule, has three normal vibrations as shown in Fig. 2.9. Normal vibrations, 1, 2, and 3 (v1 , v2 , and v3 ) are named symmetric stretching, bending, and antisymmetric stretching modes. The normal vibrations 1 and 3 have different frequencies from each other, because of different H1 …H2 interactions between the two vibrations. The three modes are all IR active but their first overtones are inactive. One can understand if overtones and combinations are active or inactive based on group theory. Bands due to their first overtones are very weak in NIR spectra, being almost impossible to be identified. Bands due to water observed in the NIR region are all due to combinations such as v1 + v3 and v2 + v3 (Fig. 2.1). Both in the cases of CO2 and H2 O molecules, the frequencies of stretching vibrations are larger than that of a bending vibration. This indicates that the stretching vibrations require larger energies than the bending vibration.\n\n2.2.2.4\n\nGroup Frequencies\n\nIn general, group frequencies are useful to consider vibrations of a polyatomic molecule. Group frequencies are vibrations of functional groups such as C = O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group, stretching vibration of an OH group, and symmetric and antisymmetric vibrations of a CH2 group. The concept of group\n\n28\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\nfrequencies hold truth when certain normal vibrations are determined substantially by movements of two or more atoms (atomic group). Group frequencies play prominent roles in analysis of IR and Raman spectra. And even for NIR spectroscopy the idea of group frequency is useful 1–7 For example, NIR spectra show bands due to the overtones and combinations of CH2 and CH3 groups. Next, let us consider vibrations of atomic groups. Figure 2.10 displays six vibrational modes of an AX2 group (e.g., CH2 , NH2 ). Of the six, two vibration modes are stretching vibrations, one being symmetric stretching vibration and the other antisymmetric stretching vibration. The remaining four are bending vibrations, i.e., scissoring, rocking, wagging, and twisting vibrations. Among the four bending vibrations, scissoring and rocking vibrations are bending vibrations in the plane of CH2 (in-plane vibrations), while wagging and twisting vibrations are vibrations which displace vertically to the plane of CH2 (out-of-plane vibrations). The idea of group frequencies is beneficial ever for a very complex molecule such as a protein and a polymer. Let us consider normal vibrations of an amide group as an example. Normal vibrations of an amide group have been calculated in detail, taking N-methylacetamide (Fig. 2.11) as a model of the amide group. Considering a methyl group as one atom, N-methylacetamide is a six-atom molecule, and hence, has twelve normal vibrations (3 × 6-6 = 12). Of the twelve, the normal vibrations shown in Fig. 2.11 are amides I, II and III modes which are key vibrations for studying the structure of proteins and nylons. As clearly seen in Fig. 2.11, the amide I has a strong\n\nFig. 2.10 Vibrations of AX2 group. 1: symmetric stretching vibration. 2: antisymmetric stretching vibration. 3: scissoring vibration. 4: rocking vibration. 5: wagging vibration. 6: twisting vibration\n\n2 Principles and Characteristics of NIR Spectroscopy\n\nAmide I\n\n29\n\nAmide II\n\nAmide III\n\nFig. 2.11 Three normal vibrations of N-methylacetamide which is a model of an amide group\n\ncharacteristic of C = O stretching vibration. Meanwhile, the amides II and III are coupling modes of C-N stretching vibrations and N-H in-plane bending vibrations. Of the three, the amides I and II appear strongly in IR spectra, and in Raman spectra the amide I and III appear intense. The amide I, II and III bands of proteins are found generally in the regions of 1690-1620 cm−1 , 1590-1510 cm−1 and 1320–1210 cm−1 , respectively. These modes are known to sensitively reflect secondary structures of polyaminoacids, peptides, and proteins. In NIR spectra bands due to the overtones and combinations of amide modes such as the combination of NH stretching mode and Amide II appear.\n\n2.2.2.5\n\nQuantum Mechanical Treatment of Vibrations of Polyatomic Molecules\n\nNow, let us study vibrations of polyatomic molecules using quantum mechanics. A kinetic energy T and a positional energy V are expressed as: Therefore, a total energy H is: 1 ˙2 Q 2 i=1 i\n\n(2.24)\n\n1 λi Q i2 2 i=1\n\n(2.25)\n\nn\n\nT =\n\nn\n\nV = Therefore, a total energy H is:\n\n1 ˙2 1 λi Q i2 Q + 2 i=1 i 2 i=1 n\n\nH =T +V =\n\nn\n\n(2.26)\n\nReplacing Q˙ with −ih/2π・d/d Q again and calculating Hˆ , we can obtain a Schrodinger equation of vibrations of polyatomic molecules. −\n\nn n 1 h2 ∂ 2ψ + λi Q i2 ψ = Eψ 8π 2 i=1 ∂ Q i2 2 i=1\n\n(2.27)\n\n30\n\nY. Ozaki and Y. Morisawa\n\nAs normal vibrations are independent of each other, the above formula can be separated into n wave equations, respectively, corresponding to the respective normal vibrations, an eigen value E υ is expressed as the sum of eigen values E i of the respective normal vibrations, and an eigen function ψ υ is given as a product of eigen functions ψ i representing the respective normal vibrations. Since Formula 2.27 has the same style as Formula 2.20, the eigen value E i is also the same as Formula 2.21. 1 hνi E i = vi + 2\n\n(2.28)\n\nTherefore, a total of vibrational energies whose frequencies are ν1 , ν2 ,…, νn is: 1 hν1 E υ = E 1 + E 2 + · · · · · · E n = υ1 + 2 1 1 hν2 + · · · · · · + υn + hνn + υ2 + 2 2\n\n(2.29)\n\nThe lowest ground state of water can be represented as (0,0,0), and (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) denote fundamental states where ν1 , ν2, and ν3, respectively, have a quantum number of 1. Transitions between the lowest ground state and the fundamental levels are called fundamentals. Next, (2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), and (0, 0, 2) represent states where ν1 , ν2 , and ν3 have a quantum number of 2, respectively, and are called overtone levels. (3, 0, 0)… are also overtone levels. Overtones are transitions between the lowest ground state and these overtone levels. Combination mode levels are levels, such as (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1), where two or more normal vibrations are excited. Transitions between the lowest ground state and the combination mode levels are called combination modes.\n\n2.2.3 Anharmonicity Until now, we have treated molecular vibrations as a harmonic oscillator. However, in reality, the harmonic oscillator model is not a good model for molecular vibrations except for the vicinity of the bottom of a potential energy curve. If the harmonic oscillator model were correct, molecules should never dissociate no matter how large the amplitude is (Fig. 2.7). Therefore, it is necessary to consider a potential energy function V (Q) (Q denotes an inter-nuclear distance) which more accurately expresses vibrations of molecules. In accordance with our instinct, V (Q) must be such a function which rapidly increases when Q < CH2 ) defined in natural coordinates are presented as an example in Table 5.1 and Fig. 5.2. The definitions of the other vibrations can be found in Ref. [5]. The transformation of Table 5.1 Recommended internal coordinate system at the example of methyl and methylene (sp3 ) groups. The complete definition for other types of functional groups can be found in Ref.

The concept of Pulay’s natural coordinate system suggest not to group stretching vibrations, but rather treat them as individual bonds. The allowed exceptions include methyl and methylene group, for which symmetrized combinations of C–H stretching vibrations may be used. The number of stretching vibrations specific to these functional groups is ruled by the number of involved DOF. Considering an archetypical system with a methyl group, X–CH3 (N = 5), the number of vibrations is 3N − 6 = 9. This is partitioned into five deformation vibrations (symmetric, two kinds of antisymmetric, and two kinds of rocking vibrations; Table 5.1) and four stretching vibrations. One stretching mode involves the X–C(H3 ) bond, leaving three possible stretching vibrations of the CH3 moiety itself; one symmetric and two kinds of antisymmetric stretching modes (Fig. 5.3). A methylene group features just two degrees of freedom due to stretching vibrations, being symmetric and antisymmetric.\n\n5.3 The Underlying Phenomena 5.3.1 The Potential Energy of a Molecular Oscillator From the point of view of quantum vibrational spectroscopy, the primary problem focuses on the determination of the potential energy function along the spatial coordinate describing the molecular oscillator, or in other words, the motion of the nuclei (Fig. 5.4) [6]. The potential is the key property that dictates the quantum states (i.e., the vibrational wavefunctions) of a molecular oscillator. Following the fundamental approximation of quantum chemistry, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the motion of nuclei can be treated separate from the motion of the electrons in the majority of cases. Consequently, in vibrational problems, the electronic structure is reduced to the source of an external potential energy. Therefore, prior to any step\n\n88\n\nK. B. Be´c et al.\n\nFig. 5.4 Interatomic potential (solid black) and the associated harmonic approximation (dashed black) of the HCl molecule in the gas phase at CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level and the respective vibrational wavefunctions (red) obtained via the Numerov approach. The associated energy differences between the individual states correspond to the wavenumbers measured via vibrational spectroscopy\n\nmade into quantum vibrational spectroscopy, the electronic structure of the system under consideration needs to be determined [6]. This can be accomplished with a large array of different approaches, aimed at providing various approximations to balance the accuracy of results and the computational demand.\n\n5.3.2 Quantum Chemical Methods for the Determination of the Electronic Structure of Molecular Systems An approach for the determination of the electronic structure of a quantum system (Fig. 5.5) may follow two principal ways of categorization; conceptual and practical. From the conceptual point of view, these methods differ by how the energy of the system is described. The major approaches will be presented in Sects. 5.3.2.1, 5.3.2.2, 5.3.2.3, 5.3.2.4, 5.3.2.5, and 5.3.2.6. More exhaustive information can be found in topic-oriented textbooks [6]. The practical categorization mostly concerns their computational complexity, with the cost versus accuracy factor of the available methods being a key consideration, which translates into their respective applicability to certain problems.\n\n5 Introduction to Quantum Vibrational Spectroscopy\n\n89\n\nFig. 5.5 Overview of computational chemistry methods commonly used for the determination of electronic structure in molecular systems and crystals\n\n5.3.2.1\n\nHartree–Fock Theory\n\nAny quantum-based treatment assumes that a wavefunction is the primary entity describing the state and therefore all observables such as the energy of a quantum many-body system. Hartree–Fock (HF) theory provides the fundamental and most straightforward approach in this category. This method is based on solving an approximate time-dependent Schrödinger equation (HF equation), which describes the state of a quantum mechanical system and the associated energy. All methods that are in practical use are based on the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which limits the role of the nuclei to the source of an external potential. The interaction between the electrons involves the exchange and the correlation potential. Within the HF formalism, only the former is treated appropriately. The exchange energy results from the indistinguishability of electrons and is reflected in the HF procedure by antisymmetric properties of the wavefunction. This step is accomplished by deriving a single Slater determinant, an antisymmetrized product of one-electron wavefunctions (i.e., orbitals), to approximate the wavefunction of an N-body quantum system. In other words, the HF formalism assumes that the problem of interactions between the many electrons in the molecule is separable into a set of electron–electron problems, coupled through an averaged effective potential that describes the interaction with all other electrons in the system. A solution to the HF equation is found by invoking the variational principle, in which a set of N-coupled equations for the N spin orbitals is derived, yielding the Hartree–Fock wavefunction and energy of the system. The HF framework belongs to the family of self-consistent field (SCF) methods, as self-consistency is a criterion\n\n90\n\nK. B. Be´c et al.\n\nthat needs to be fulfilled within the iterative procedure of solving the Hartree equations. The most far-reaching approximation assumed in the HF approach is neglecting the Coulomb correlation, which is often described as the mean-field charge distribution approximation of the electron correlation, since the HF method effectively averages the electron–electron interactions. This causes an inherent inability of the method to properly describe London dispersion. In order to step beyond a mean-field approximation of independent particles, so-called post-HF methods have been developed. The HF theory has a critical historical importance, being the first developed quantum theory with practical implementation. Nowadays, pure HF calculations are rarely used. However, the method is still widely adopted for calculations of the initial wavefunction of a quantum system, thus representing the preliminary step for calculations at higher levels of theory. On the other hand, a hierarchy of increasingly accurate methods based on the HF results exist, in which more than one Slater determinant is employed.\n\n5.3.2.2\n\nPost-HF Approaches\n\nDifferent populations of atomic orbitals by electrons or electron configurations in a quantum system are possible. When any given electron changes its configuration, which can be described as an excitation into another orbital, the distribution of the other electrons in the molecule adjusts to minimize the total energy of the system. Thus, the motion of electrons is not independent but correlated, which lowers the total energy of the system. However, in the HF approach, any given electron only interacts with the average potential of all the other electrons in the system. To amend this shortcoming, post-HF methods aiming at a more accurate treatment of electron correlation effects were introduced. This may be accomplished in different ways, but unequivocally increases the computational complexity of the method by orders of magnitude. In the simplest case, the electron correlation energy can be treated as a perturbation of the electronic state described in the HF formalism. As long as electron correlation has a relatively small contribution to the total energy, it can be expressed via a perturbing Hamiltonian corresponding to a correction added to the HF Hamiltonian. Since the unperturbed HF state is known, the perturbative correction is solvable using approximate methods, e.g., via an asymptotic series. The practical formulation of this approach is based on Møller–Plesset theory (MP) of a given order k. Zeroth-order wavefunction corresponds to an unperturbed HF state, and the firstorder perturbation correction (MP1) to the HF energy can be shown to be equal to zero, which implies that only second- (MP2) and higher-order MP expressions are practically meaningful. Among those, MP2 bears the highest practical usefulness and finds broad applications. In most cases, higher-order perturbations (such as MP3, MP4, and MP5) do not improve the accuracy by an acceptable margin and display a huge computational demand. The MP2 method has become particularly widely applied since it is the most efficient approach to take electron correlation\n\n5 Introduction to Quantum Vibrational Spectroscopy\n\n91\n\neffects into account. However, there are limitations in the applicability of MP theory, which led to the development of more advanced approaches. Unlike the HF formalism, configuration interaction (CI) theory utilizes multiple Slater determinants to construct configuration state functions (CSF), which are then linearly combined to describe the wavefunction of the quantum system. The first term in the expansion of the CI wavefunction is equivalent to the HF ground-state wavefunction, while the higher terms capture the effects of the correlated motion of the electrons. In the CI formalism, the wavefunction is a combination of the HF reference states plus all possible excited states. This is reflected by mixing the ground CSFs and the excited CSFs. If all possibilities of orbital occupations are included (full-CI, FCI), an exact solution to the electron correlation problem can be achieved. Unfortunately, the number of excited configurations is enormously large, and in practice, the number of CI terms representing the electronic excitations needs to be truncated. The abbreviations for truncated CI variants reflect the excitation levels treated; ‘S’ for single excitations, ‘D’ for double, ‘T’ for triple, ‘Q’ for quadruple. This leads to CI single and double excitations (CISD), CI single, double, and triple excitations (CISDT), etc. From the point of view of quantum theory, CI is the most complete approach to describe the electronic structure of molecular systems. However, this corresponds only to FCI, that is, the case in which all orbital occupations possible for the quantum system are treated. The FCI method is useful for validation and benchmarking purposes of lower-level quantum methods, where its extensive computational cost remains manageable. In practical terms, unless FCI conditions are achieved, the application of truncated variants is often linked to considerable inaccuracies. Truncated CI methods capture a rapidly decreasing amount of the ‘exact’ correlation energy with an increase of the system size, which limits their usefulness in treating larger molecules and heavy atoms. Multiconfigurational selfconsistent field (MCSCF) is an analogous approach that additionally applies a similar CI-like concept also to derive the one-electron functions that are subsequently used to construct CSFs. Coupled-cluster theory (CC) expands the molecular orbitals obtained at HF level using an exponential cluster operator (acting as the excitation operator) and constructs a multi-electron wavefunction that includes electron correlation. The CC formalism may be considered as an alternative to CI, which produces an equivalent combination of one-electron functions to yield the multi-electron wavefunction. However, unlike linear combination assumed in the latter, the exponential expansion used in the former grants its size-extensivity resulting in an improved limiting behavior of the CC correlation energy upon truncation to a given excitation level (e.g., CCSD). Similar practical limitations as those found in CI apply here as well. The number of treated electronic excitations needs to be limited in order to make the method applicable in terms of the associated computational demand. This leads to variants, abbreviated analogous to CI variants, e.g., CCSD, CCSDT, etc. Unfortunately, in practical use, the CCSD level yields moderately correct results considering its cost, while the more accurate CCSDT proves to be too expensive for most applications. For this reason, CCSD(T) was introduced as a variant approximating the triple excitations via perturbation theory. Note, however, that when truncated at the same level,\n\n92\n\nK. B. Be´c et al.\n\nCC approaches still capture a higher fraction of the correlation energy than their CI counterparts do, albeit at a higher computational cost. The CCSD(T) variant is highly valued for its high accuracy achieved at a relatively acceptable computational cost, and is often considered as the “golden standard of quantum chemistry.”\n\n5.3.2.3\n\nDensity-Functional Theory\n\nInclusion of electron correlation in wavefunction-based methods leads to a steep increase in their computational complexity. This gave an impulse for the development of a fundamentally different concept known as density-functional theory (DFT) [7, 8]. It is based on the Hohenburg–Kohn theorems postulating that the state of a many-electron system can be described based on a unique functional (i.e., a function acting on another function), which in this case is the spatially dependent electron density function. The benefit of this formalism is a reduction of the dimensionality of the problem from that of a multidimensional (3N) N-electron wavefunction to a three-dimensional electron density function. The practical implementation of DFT became possible due to the formulation of the Kohn–Sham equations, which enabled the reduction of an intractable problem of interacting electrons in a static external potential to a tractable problem of non-interacting electrons in a local effective potential, i.e., the Kohn–Sham potential. The latter is constituted by the external potential plus electron exchange and correlation effects expressed via the associated exchange–correlation functional E xc . Unfortunately, the exact E xc is unknown except for the limiting case of a free electron gas, which became known as the local-density LDA ). While this formalism is applicable in case of metals approximation (LDA; Exc and simple ionic solids, the LDA approximation fails to deliver satisfactory results for more complex systems. The meaningful development of DFT within the regime of chemistry started with the introduction of the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) level, which was followed by more advanced approximations, such as metaGGA functionals. A significant progress in the underlying theory was marked with the introduction of hybrid Kohn–Sham theory and the resulting hybrid formulation for E xc . A hybrid E xc is constructed as a linear combination of GGA and/or LDA (explicit) functionals and a HF ‘exact’ exchange functional (implicit functional). This inclusion of an ab initio electron exchange term in hybrid functionals greatly improved the accuracy and applicability of DFT. Popular hybrid functionals include the B3LYP, PBE0, HSE, and M06 functionals. Further advancement was achieved with the development of double-hybrid functionals. These approaches represent a natural progression from hybrid functionals, as in addition to the exchange term, ab initio correlation is included as well. The correlation is calculated similar to postHF methods, e.g., MP2 correlation is employed in B2PLYP, mPW2PLYP, PBE0DH, or PBEQIDH double-hybrids. In addition to a much improved treatment of electron correlation, double-hybrid functionals also enable a better implementation of HF exchange; however, they are significantly more expensive than single-hybrid functionals.\n\n5 Introduction to Quantum Vibrational Spectroscopy\n\n93\n\nThe DFT concept is a rigorous re-interpretation of the quantum many-body problem. It offers a significant improvement in the affordability of calculations. Unfortunately, its practical implementation needs to include approximated electron exchange and correlation. The formulation of DFT limits the ability to improve its quality systematically. Instead, different functionals have been parametrized (i.e., calibrated) toward better accuracy when applied to certain systems. Inherent limitations of DFT, e.g., poor description of long-range (dispersive or non-covalent) interactions were recently mitigated by introduction of empirical corrections of dispersion, e.g., the series of Grimme’s dispersion models (GD). Despite some shortcomings, DFT offers highly favorable cost versus accuracy level that made it particularly widely used in spectroscopic studies.\n\n5.3.2.4\n\nSemi-empirical Concept\n\nSemi-empirical quantum chemistry methods are derived by insertion of predetermined parameters into quantum mechanical calculation schemes. The most straightforward semi-empirical treatment replaces the relatively most timeconsuming calculation procedures in the HF ansatz, i.e., two-electron integrals are omitted and their values are provided as empirical parameters to produce the expected results. These parameters are most often obtained from higher-level quantum mechanical calculations performed for small-scale models, and then used universally. Semi-empirical methods are significantly more affordable than their corresponding quantum mechanical frameworks, and thus suitable for the treatment of large molecules. Conceptually, in some cases semi-empirical schemes are relatively more complete, as empirical parameters may better describe some phenomena (e.g., electron correlation effects) than the ab initio approach with necessary approximations. Accordingly, as long as the considered system fits the conditions of the parametrization, semi-empirical calculations may yield more accurate results than when treated with a pure HF formalism. However, semi-empirical calculations are prone to produce erroneous results if they are applied outside of their area of parametrization. Therefore, they need to be used with care. Semi-empirical schemes based on a wavefunction ansatz include the Austin Model 1 (AM1), the parametric model family of methods (e.g., PM3, PM5) that implement the neglect of differential diatomic overlap (NDDO) principle (all two-electron integrals involving two-center charge distributions are neglected) as well as a number of additional approximations and corrections, depending on the particular method. A similar concept may also be applied to density-based methods. For example, densityfunctional-based tight-binding (DFTB) inserts pre-calculated parameters into the DFT calculation scheme, in which a minimal basis and only nearest-neighbor interactions are employed. The resulting deficiency in the description of long-range interactions is corrected with empirical dispersion (analogous to those developed for DFT functionals). The resulting approach yields reasonably accurate results at a fraction of the cost of DFT calculations. Although primarily popular decades ago, when the technology barrier prevented wider use of higher-level quantum methods,\n\n94\n\nK. B. Be´c et al.\n\nsemi-empirical methods remain continuously evolving with newer variants developed, e.g., PM6, PM7, or new concepts introduced such as self-consistent change density-functional tight binding (SCC DFTB).\n\n5.3.2.5\n\nMolecular Mechanics\n\nAn alternative to QM-based approaches is the description of interatomic potentials in an entirely empirical way. These methods are typically referred to as molecular mechanics (MM) or force fields (FF) [9–11]. In this approach, the potential energy is calculated as a function of the nuclear coordinates using empirical (i.e., pre-parametrized) interaction potentials. Accordingly, MM uses classical mechanics to describe the forces acting between the atoms in a molecule. In the most fundamental approach, the interatomic potential energy is described as a sum of non-covalent pairwise interactions resulting from electrostatic (Coulomb) and van-der-Waals (e.g., Lennard-Jones) contributions, while covalent contributions such as bond and valence angle interactions are often represented via harmonic potentials centered on preoptimized equilibria. These pair-wise additive approaches comprise the simplest possible description of the systems and are typically applied in the regime of (bio)organic chemistry (e.g., peptide/protein systems, nucleic acids, organic polymer materials) as well as for the treatment of simple solid-state systems such as oxide materials. In order to improve the accuracy of these approaches over the pair-wise additive character, a variety of improved MM methods have been developed. One of the simplest approaches to improve the pair-wise additive character is the inclusion of explicit coupling terms for bonded interactions with the Urey–Bradly angular term and the Axilrod–Teller three-body potential being typical examples. More advanced frameworks comprise the inclusion of polarization effects, which can for example be achieved using charge-on-spring/shell models, explicit polarization approaches as well as charge equilibration schemes. While these approaches are essentially linked to the Coulombic character of the interaction, many-body potentials such as the Finnis–Sinclair and embedded-atom models (EAMs) attempt to improve the description of the non-Coulombic contributions with typical applications being in the area of metals, alloys, and semiconductors. A comparably challenging yet highly intriguing development enjoying increased success in recent years is the formulation of dissociative/reactive force field approaches, capable of adequately describing the formation and cleavage of chemical bonds along the calculation. The approximate nature of the interatomic forces described this way implies that force fields need to be heavily parametrized to yield an accurate description of the potential energy surface of a molecular system. The practical concept of MM is based on the assumption that a force field parametrized on the basis of a small-scale model, for which more accurate QM methods may be used, is reasonably well transferrable to larger systems. The parametrization may be also based on experimental data, if available. This fundamentally different approach has a significant consequence in the terms of accuracy versus complexity factor. Consequently, MM is applicable to extensively complex molecular systems counting up to millions of atoms.\n\n5 Introduction to Quantum Vibrational Spectroscopy\n\n95\n\nTherefore, MM is the only method of computational chemistry presently capable of treating multiscale chemical systems. Examples include large biological systems, solvated systems involving a large solvent volume, as well as composite materials. The unmatched affordability of MM makes it useful for molecular dynamics simulations. It is possible, e.g. to obtain vibrational spectra of the molecular models treated by molecular dynamics by calculating the dipole moment autocorrelation function. From the point of view of NIR spectroscopy, however, the MM potentials are too approximate to yield useful results. Briefly mentioned here should be hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches, in which only the chemically most relevant part of the molecular system is treated quantum mechanically while MM potentials are considered as sufficiently accurate to model all remaining interactions. These QM/MM schemes enable a more accurate treatment of the potential in key molecular fragments important from the point of view of a particular study.\n\n5.3.2.6\n\nThe Fundamental Dilemma in Computational Chemistry; Cost Versus Accuracy Factor\n\nWith few exceptions, in computational chemistry, a higher accuracy can only be achieved with a significant increase in the demand for resources, understood mostly as calculation time or/and memory requirements. The nominal complexity of a method is limited to the number of electrons/atoms in the systems and scales distinctly different among the methods presented here. From the point of view of practical applications in spectroscopy, this should be a fundamental consideration as the application of higher levels of theory to the molecular system of interest may become prohibitively expensive. In the most straightforward case, the computational complexity of MM simulations is proportional to the square of the number of treated atomic centers N, O(N 2 ), whereas advanced implementations are capable of reducing the scaling to O(N log N). The simplest ab initio HF method formally scales as O(N 4 ). However, those schemes are widely regarded as not being sufficiently accurate for spectroscopic applications. The significant improvement in accuracy of post-HF approaches comes at a steep increase in their complexity, e.g., starting from O(N 5 ) for MP2, O(N 7 ) for CCSD(T), and O(N 8 ) scaling for CCSDT. The CI formalism elevates this trend further, with CISD O(N 6 ), CISDTQ O(N 10 ), while FCI is known to scale factorial with respect to the system size. In addition, post-HF methods require a larger number of functions describing the distribution of each electron (i.e., basis sets of one-electron functions) to provide accurate results. This gives an answer to the question that may arise at some point, about the root cause for numerous approximations that have been introduced to quantum theory in practical implementations. Such consideration explains the impact that DFT has in the field of practical applications, as it scales as O(N 3 ), proportionally to the spatial dimensionality of the electron density function. Calculations performed with popular hybrid functionals such as B3LYP nominally scale as O(N 4 ) but their practical effectiveness is enhanced by a decisively more rapid basis set convergence typical for DFT in comparison with\n\n96\n\nK. B. Be´c et al.\n\nwavefunction-based approaches. In combination with further computational techniques such as efficient pre-screening approaches, the use of sparse matrix algebra routines, as well as convergence accelerators aimed at keeping the number of iterations small, DFT offers a remarkably favorable level of efficiency, an advantage which is well-reflected by the popularity of its use in spectroscopic studies.\n\n5.4 Harmonic Frequency Evaluation 5.4.1 Molecular Geometry Optimization Toward the Energy Minimum Geometry optimization, or energy minimization, is the procedure of determination of the atomic (nuclear) coordinates of a molecule, which result in the lowest total potential energy of the system. A molecule’s potential energy V (Q) is a many-parameter function of its atomic coordinates, represented as the vector Q = {q1 , q2 ,…, q3N −Ninv }. In principle, geometry optimization is a purely mathematical optimization problem of finding Q that minimizes V (Q). In other words, it is a search for atomic coordinates of the molecule that minimize its potential energy. For a stationary point on the potential energy surface (PES), the energy gradient (the derivative of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates, ∂V/∂qi ) is zero. A generic implementation of the geometry optimization procedure is an iterative process of adjusting Q by following the gradient toward zero. Note, the definition of the atomic coordinates is not implicitly imposed. These may be, e.g., Cartesian coordinates, or internal coordinates describing bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles. The quantum theory model that provides V (Q) is also not imposed from the point of view of the optimization problem. As it will be demonstrated in the next section, geometry optimization performed in order to bring the system to its local minimum on the potential energy surface is a mandatory step prior to the execution of a harmonic frequency analysis.\n\n5.4.2 Harmonic Approximation Quantum chemical approaches to vibrational motion are in many points analogous to the problem of electronic structure. Accordingly, the theory of the vibrational structure is based on the time-independent vibrational (nuclear) Schrödinger equation [2]. The Born–Oppenheimer approximation still applies, but in this case, the electronic structure is reduced to the role of the source of an external potential upon which the motion of nuclei depends. The vibrational Hamiltonian of a polyatomic oscillator can be expressed as (Eq. 5.1)\n\n5 Introduction to Quantum Vibrational Spectroscopy\n\nH =−\n\n97\n\n1 1 ∂2 1 2 2 + mi ω0i qi + kijk qi qj qk + kijkl qi qj qk ql + · · · 2 2 i mi ∂qi 2 i i≤j≤k i≤j≤k≤l (5.1)\n\nwhere mi is the reduced mass of the i-th normal mode and ω0i the corresponding harmonic frequency given as ω0i =\n\nki mi\n\n(5.2)\n\nwith k i being the harmonic force constant. The third and higher terms in the expansion describe anharmonic contributions to the vibrational Hamiltonian via the associated cubic and quartic force constants, k ijk and k ijkl , respectively. Commonly, anharmonic contributions diminish consecutively toward higher terms, with the third (cubic) and fourth (quartic) terms capturing the majority of the total anharmonicity. As it will be demonstrated further, taking into account anharmonic contributions staggeringly increases the complexity of the vibrational problem. However, a universal rule in physics states that the harmonic motion is a generic feature for sufficiently low-amplitude vibrations. This applies reasonably well for a number of molecular vibrations as reflected by relatively low contributions from the anharmonic terms in Eq. 5.1. Based on this premise, an approach called harmonic approximation is constructed. Within this approximation, no coupling between modes is permitted, which implies that all k ijk , k ijkl , and higher-order constants are set to zero. In other words, the normal vibrations of harmonic oscillator are entirely independent. Therefore, in Eq. 5.1, all terms beyond the second one are ignored, in many cases with an acceptable loss of accuracy. Next, the potential in the vicinity of the equilibrium is approximated as a Taylor series (Eq. 5.3) 1 V (Q) = V0 (Q) + QT · g(Q) + QT HQ + · · · 2\n\n(5.3)\n\nwith the higher terms in the expansion being neglected. At a stationary point on the PES, i.e. minima and transition states, the gradient g(Q), and hence the second term in Eq. 5.3, is equal to zero as well. This results in a quadratic function as the approximation of the potential, corresponding to a harmonic potential. In practical applications, the mass-weighted second-derivative matrix of the potential, or massweighted Hessian H is introduced, which elements are given as: 1 ∂ 2 V (Q) mw =√ Hi,j mi mj ∂qi ∂qj\n\n(5.4)\n\n98\n\nK. B. Be´c et al.\n\nDiagonalization of the mass-weighted Hessian yields a matrix with 3N − N inv columns consisting of orthonormal eigenvectors that describe the vibrational motion of the system within the harmonic approximation, the so-called mass-weighted normal modes. The 3N − N inv diagonal elements of the eigenvalue matrix h are proportional to the square frequency of the associated normal mode. h = UT HU\n\n(5.5)\n\nThe example of how the harmonic approximation simplifies the true behavior of a vibrating molecule is demonstrated for the case of a water molecule, H1OH2 (Fig. 5.6), considering a two-dimensional example limited to the two OH "
