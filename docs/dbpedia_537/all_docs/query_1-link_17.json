        "text": "Management stocks\n\nFor management, at least four geographic stocks of bowhead whales are recognised. The stocks are geographically separated by landmasses or extensive sea ice. The stocks are:\n\nThe Eastern Canada-West Greenland (ECWG) stock (Frasier et al. 2015)\n\nThe East Greenland-Svalbard-Barents Sea stock (EGSB, earlier referred to as the Spitsbergen stock)\n\nThe Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea stock (BCB)\n\nThe Okhotsk Sea stock (OKH)\n\nIWC operates with the ECWG population as being two distinct stocks: the Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin stock and the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait stock. The reason behind the stock delineation was the separation of bowhead whale summering areas in Baffin Bay and Foxe Basin, and the assumption that baleen whales make seasonal north-south movements rather than east-west movements. Exchange between the bowhead whale summering populations was therefore considered unlikely.\n\nHowever, neither historic nor scientific evidence has been presented confirming the separation of these two stocks. On the contrary, scientific studies based on photographic evidence and satellite tracking have linked bowhead whales between West Greenland and the Hudson Strait (Heide-Jørgensen et al. 2006). Furthermore, genetic studies support a one-stock hypothesis for the ECWG bowhead whale population. It has also been found that whales from the ECWG population are genetically distinct from the more westerly Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population (DFO 2015).\n\nFor management purposes, particularly regarding establishing quotas for subsistence hunting, it is essential to know the stock structure of populations. The recognition of one stock of bowhead whales in Foxe Basin-Hudson Bay/Baffin Bay-Davis Strait has led to a shared quota for the stock instead of different quotas for each of the two areas (DFO 2009, 2015).\n\nFor the EGSB stock, research shows that despite the small population size, the stock has a high genomic diversity (Bachmann et al., 2021; Cerca et al., 2022).\n\nBowhead whale migration in the North Atlantic\n\nMigratory patterns of bowhead whales have been documented from aerial surveys, shore- and ship-based observations, telemetry studies, and from subsistence whaling activities. Bowhead whales from the ECWG stock spend the winter in Hudson Strait, northern Hudson Bay, or along the pack-ice edge extending to coastal West Greenland. Bowhead whales may also be found in winter in the North Water Polynya, and in polynyas along the east coast of Baffin Island. In spring, the whales are found along the West Greenland coast (primarily Disko Bay), in Hudson Strait, Cumberland Sound, and the entrance to Lancaster Sound. In spring, the whales cross Baffin Bay from Disko Bay to Lancaster Sound. The whales stay within the high Canadian Arctic or along the east coast of Baffin Island in summer and early autumn and winter in Hudson Strait or at the West Greenland coast (Heide-Jørgensen et al. 2006).\n\nRecently a study showed overlap of the ECWG stock and the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock when two whales spent time in the same area in the Northwest Passage in the high Canadian Arctic (Heide-Jørgensen et al. 2012b). Sea ice in the Northwest Passage is thus perhaps not a physical barrier separating bowhead whales from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as previously assumed.\n\nEast Greenland-Svalbard-Barents Sea stock\n\nThe Spitsbergen stock is confined to the Northeast Atlantic from the Greenland Sea between East Greenland to the Barents and Kara Seas and into the Russian Arctic (Norwegian Polar Institute 2016). Little is known about the migratory behaviour of this small stock. A survey conducted in April 2006 found whales in Fram Strait between East Greenland and Svalbard, which is a wintering site for this population (Wiig et al. 2007). There have also been bowhead sightings from Spitsbergen fjords during summer. Historical records from whaling operations show that whales stay north and northwest of Spitsbergen in spring, and around Jan Mayen in the same seasons. Whales were also found in the Greenland Sea in May–June. The seasonal pattern for this population is “up-side down” compared to other populations that travel north in summer and south in winter (Moore & Reeves 1993).\n\nHunting methods in NAMMCO countries\n\nPeople’s right to hunt and utilise marine mammals is a firmly established principle in NAMMCO, and hunting conditions and techniques have always been priority issues. Embedded in this right is also an obligation to conduct the hunt in a sustainable way and in such a way that it minimises animal suffering (NAMMCO 2010a).\n\nGreenland\n\nBesides annual hunting quotas, a number of regulations have to be met for bowhead whale hunting to be legal in West Greenland. Hunters are required to hold a valid full-time occupational hunting license, a species-specific license, an approved harpoon gun, and mandatory fishing gear to be allowed to take part in the bowhead whale hunt. Furthermore, hunters must attend a course in the use of ‘whale-grenades’ to be allowed to buy and handle those grenades. The hunter that holds the bowhead-license also must report his plans for the hunt of the bowhead whale to the authorities.\n\nThe bowhead whale can only be hunted between April 1st and December 31st. Only adult whales can be taken and calves as well as females with calves are fully protected. The actual bowhead whale hunt requires three whale hunting boats of at least 11 m. Mandatory hunting gear on the boats includes a harpoon gun (calibre of at least 50 mm with approved whale grenades for large whales) and a line or trawl winch with a tractive force of at least five tonnes. Furthermore, the boats must be equipped with buoys that prevent the whale from sinking. A wounded bowhead whale has to be put down using a ‘whale-grenade’ shot to the breast-region.\n\nOnce killed, the whales have to be flensed at a location approved by the authorities. All parts of the whale must be used. If there’s too much meat for the hunters themselves to use or sell, the remaining meat must be given to the local community.\n\nFurthermore, the catch has to be reported to the authorities before it can be sold, and a tissue sample delivered to the local authority. There can also be regulations regarding where it is allowed to hunt whales and where only whale-safaris can take place (Government of Greenland 2016).\n\nPast and current hunt\n\nA tragic whaling history\n\nThe need for blubber, meat, oil, bones, and baleen started the European hunt for whales in the Arctic region. The bowhead whale, a fat, slow swimmer that floats after death, was an ideal target for the European, and later American, whaling ships to exploit. The original or ‘traditional’ form of commercial whaling was distinct from ‘modern’ commercial whaling, which was characterised by fast, motorised vessels with harpoon guns. The exploitation of the bowhead whale precedes the era of modern commercial hunting and ended in the early 1900s (Ross 1993).\n\nThe start and subsequent expansion\n\nWhaling for bowhead whales, also called the Greenland whale, polar whale or simply whale at the time, began off the southern coast of Labrador around 1540. As the whaling for bowhead whales in this area levelled off towards termination in the early 1600s, bowhead whaling started near Spitsbergen. The whaling activities continued and by the year 1700, had expanded into the Davis Strait region and into Hudson Bay in 1860. By the late 19th century, when whaling was in its last phase, whalers were hunting bowhead whales throughout the North Atlantic sector. In the 19th century, American whalers went for the bowhead whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas (Ross 1993). The hunt for bowhead whales thus continued over almost four centuries at levels driving the bowhead stocks close to extinction.\n\nEstimating the total catch\n\nIt has been estimated that since 1530, 70,000 bowhead whales were landed in Eastern Canada and West Greenland – a figure that combines commercial and Inuit hunts using data from revised previous catch series (Higdon 2010). This estimate is without struck-and-lost animals. To maintain the overall killed whales, struck-and-lost animals ought to be added (struck-and-lost rates of 15–20% have previously been used by Mitchell (1977)).\n\nProtection\n\nIn 1931, the League of Nations Convention protected the bowhead whale from commercial whaling. Some limited subsistence whaling was still carried out by Inuit in Alaska though. In 1946, IWC was established by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The IWC continued the prohibition on commercial whaling starting in 1931 and began to regulate commercial whaling among signatory nations in 1964. In 1977, the IWC called for a ban on the increasing subsistence bowhead whaling in Alaska due to concerns about the status of the whale populations. A full ban was not implemented, instead, the IWC granted a limited quota (Reeves & Leatherwood 1985).\n\nStock sizes prior to commercial whaling\n\nSeveral attempts at estimating pre-exploitation stock sizes of bowhead whales have been performed. Historical records and population models (often in combination) have been used for these attempts. However, such estimation is a difficult exercise due to a lack of both a complete catch record and basic information on biological parameters.\n\nWoodby and Botkin (1993) have estimated the pre-exploitation stock size for the Spitzbergen stock to be 25,000, Davis Strait 11,000, Hudson Bay 575, Bering Sea 18,000 and the Okhotsk Sea 6,500. In 2006, Allen and Keay reconstructed the Greenland-Spitzbergen bowhead population throughout the period of commercial exploitation by European whaling vessels (1611–1911). The estimate of approximately 52,500 adult bowhead whales resident in the waters between the east coast of Greenland and Spitsbergen in 1611 was calculated using species-specific biological parameters, a delayed-difference recruitment model, and historical whaling records. The estimate of Allen and Keay (2006) was more than double of the previous estimate from Woodby and Botkin (1993). Also, Higdon (2010) suggests that using his revised catch series would improve estimates of pre-exploitation population size over previous attempts.\n\nThese few examples give an indication of the complexity of estimating pre-exploitation stock sizes of commercially hunted whales. Regardless of the exact size of the pre-exploitation population, there is no doubt that there were numerous bowhead whales in the Arctic and sub-Arctic waters prior to the start of the whaling era. The removal of that many large marine mammals in a fairly short period of time can be assumed to have had an enormous impact on the Arctic ecosystems (Allen & Keay 2006).\n\nACOUSTIC POLLUTION\n\nAcoustic pollution is one of the new ‘threats’ facing bowhead whales. Anthropogenic noise in Arctic waters is increasing as human activity increases as a consequence of climate change. Lesser sea ice and an extended open-water season expand the possibilities for exploration and exploitation for oil and gas in the Arctic region. An increase in shipping and shipping routes in otherwise previously impassable regions is also expected (Reeves et al.2014). In addition, noise from military activity (e.g. sonar), helicopters and airplanes, and marine constructions add to the overall acoustic load now present in Arctic waters, which were previously largely devoid of anthropogenic noise.\n\nAs marine mammals rely heavily on both hearing and producing sounds for a number of vital behaviours like communication and navigation, prey detection, predator avoidance, and mate selection, any increase in underwater sound levels can affect these important functions (Blackwell et al. 2015).\n\nBowhead whales have been seen to decrease their calling rates during autumn migration in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea when they were in proximity to seismic operations. When sound levels were above a certain threshold, the whales were virtually silent. The effects on the animals from such a change in behaviour are unknown (Blackwell et al. 2015).\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS\n\nReductions in sea ice as a consequence of climate change will likely have negative effects on some marine mammals, for example, seals that give birth to pups on ice. However, the reliance of the ice-associated whales on sea ice-mediated ecosystems is more unclear (Laidre et al. 2008, Moore and Huntington 2008). Reductions in sea ice may actually enhance feeding opportunities for bowhead whales on prey both produced in and/or advected to their summer and autumn habitats (Moore & Laidre 2006). Despite roughly two decades of sea ice loss in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population has increased steadily at a growth rate of 3.4%, suggesting that sea ice reduction is not hindering recruitment to this population as it rebounds from overhunting during commercial whaling (George et al. 2004). Potential consequence of ice loss is increase in predation from killer whales (Willoughby et al., 2020). Anticipated changes for the bowhead whale populations could, however, include migration alteration and occupation of new feeding areas (Moore & Huntington 2008). Overall, their capacity to adapt to new or different food resources will play a key role in their success in a changing environment (Kovacs et al., 2011).\n\nFuture seasonal changes in habitat for bowhead whales during predicted ocean warming East and West of Greenland between 2020 and 2100 were modelled by Chambault et al. (2022). They used two climate scenarios, business as usual and a second one which assumes a warming below 2°C. The models predicted a north-westward expansion of bowhead whales’ habitat in West Greenland into the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in winter. In East Greenland, the animals will lose most of their current habitat under the business as usual, but under the second scenario, some new habitat might become available further north. In summer, the models projected a northerly shift of key habitats, with a significant habitat loss for both sides, with the most loss suggested under the first scenario. Predicted habitats are expected to decrease in summer for both scenarios −68% (±15.3) and −28% (±53.7) respectively. In summer, bowhead whales of West Greenland are predicted to shift northward 475 km (± 261 km) under the second scenario.\n\nAround Svalbard, observations of bowhead whales have increased north of the archipelago and decreased in coastal areas and fjords of the archipelago. This is coupled with a retreating sea-ice edge, which they are asso­ciated with (Bengtsson et al., 2022).\n\nAlthough bowhead whales may benefit from lesser sea ice through increased access to prey, the bowhead whales face a growing number of anthropogenic threats as the Arctic becomes more accessible for humans. The impact on bowhead whale populations of potential risks like oil spills, collisions with ships, increased ocean pollution, emissions from mining activities etc. remain, for now, uncertain.\n\nResearch in NAMMCO member countries\n\nBowhead whales are the subject of extended research activities in both Greenland and Norway. This includes photo identification work (Heide-Jørgensen & Finley, 1991), satellite telemetry studies (Heide-Jørgensen et al. 2003, 2006, 2012a, Lydersen et al. 2012, Kovacs et al. 2020), acoustic analyses (Stafford et al. 2012, 2018, Tervo 2009, 2011, 2012a,b, Ahonen et al. 2017), genetic research (Borge et al. 2007, Rekdal et al. 2015, Keane et al. 2015) and studies on age and reproduction (Heide-Jørgensen et al. 2012a). This work has expanded our knowledge of bowhead whale migration patterns, stock structure, behaviour, and life-history. Surveys (Boertmann et al. 2015, Heide-Jørgensen et al. 2007, Vacquié-Garcia et al. 2017) have also added to our knowledge through creating estimates of abundance.\n\nRECENT AND ONGOING STUDIES\n\nGreenland\n\nRekdal et al. (2015) used two different methods for estimating abundance and trends of bowhead whales in Disko Bay, West Greenland: aerial survey and genetic mark-recapture approach. They found that the two abundance estimates were complementary. The aerial survey provided a snapshot that is useful for examining the local trend without dependence between years. The genetic mark-recapture approach estimates the size of the actual source population, but this approach is considered less suited for time series estimates as it would require samples over many years. The authors concluded that although the two approaches do not necessarily lead to identical estimates, in combination, they give valuable insight into trends affecting abundance and the fraction of the population that is present within the surveyed area (Rekdal et al. 2015).\n\nLong-term studies of bowhead whales in Disko Bay are ongoing. In 2018 and 2019, these studies focused on testing technology for combining satellite telemetry and recording sounds on the surface of whale bodies, in order to better understand the effects of noise from seismic air guns. Oceanographic tags that record temperature, salinity, depth and position are also under development (National Progress Report Greenland 2019). The focus for 2020 is on the collection of biopsy samples for mark-recapture abundance estimates (National Progress Report Greenland 2020).\n\nIn 2019, hunters from Qeqetarsuaq collected biopsies of bowhead whales during spring in Disko Bay. These will be used by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources for mark-recapture abundance estimates (National Progress Report Greenland 2018, 2019).\n\nBoertmann et al. (2015) took advantage of an aerial survey for walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) in part of the Northeast Water Polynya (NEW) and observed several bowhead whales, resulting in an abundance estimate of 102 (95 % CI: 32–329) individuals. The otherwise fairly inaccessible area has only recently been visited by researchers. The authors concluded that the NEW might be one of the most important summering grounds for the EGSB stock and proposed that their results provide renewed hope that this stock was recovering from depletion due to commercial whaling (Boertmann et al. 2015).\n\nNorway\n\nNorwegian waters have been monitored acoustically since 2008. Passive acoustic recorders were placed in Fram Strait (Stafford et al. 2012, Moore et al. 2011) and Chukchi Plateau (Moore et al. 2011) to sample this part of bowhead whale habitat. Over a six-year period, 2008–2014, an autonomous underwater acoustic recorder (AURAL) was installed in western Fram Strait to investigate the soundscape of this important breeding ground of bowhead whales (Ahonen et al. 2017). In the same area in western Fram Strait, another acoustic study was conducted where omni-directional hydrophone recorders were deployed and redeployed annually from 2010 to 2014 in September. This study documents extremely high inter- and intra-annual diversity in the mammalian song from the EGSB bowhead whale population (Stafford et al. 2018). AURALS deployed also on the eastside of Svalbard show presence of bowhead whales throughout the winter and into the summer as long as the area has ice cover (Llobet et al. 2023\n\nDuring summer of 2015, a study that involved helicopter- and ship-based line transects was conducted in ice-covered areas from the Russian border in the east (35°E) to northwest of Svalbard in the west (7°E) and estimated the number of bowhead whales in this area (Vacquié-Garcia et al. 2017).\n\nBowhead whales are also monitored by biologging and biotelemetry. First ever satellite tagging of EGSB stock was a female bowhead whale tagged on 3 April 2010 in Fram Strait (Lydersen at al. 2012). In July 2017, 16 satellite transmitters were deployed from a helicopter to study movement and space use relative to environmental conditions within seasons (Kovacs et al. 2020). In a study by Hamilton et al. 2021, biotelemetry data from marine mammals tagged around the Svalbard Archipelago, in the northern Barents Sea, Fram Strait, and along the northeast coast of Greenland during the period 2005−2019 was collected and analysed (Hamilton et al. 2021). In period 2017–2019, 23 biologging devices were deployed in EGSB as a part of the study that had the aim to identify hotspots and areas of high species richness for Arctic marine mammals (Hamilton et al. 2022).\n\nAhonen, H., Stafford, K.
