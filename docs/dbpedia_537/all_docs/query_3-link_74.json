This handbook is designed for use with digital collections of primary sources available at the Wisconsin Historical Societyʹs Web site (www.wisconsinhistory.org). It reproduces activities from workshops offered to teachers in 2005 by the Society. Its first half reviews the elements of critical thinking as they pertain to understanding and analyzing historical evidence. This includes 10 handouts that can be quickly adapted for use with students, as well as a toolkit of classroom techniques for encouraging critical thinking and a guide to evaluating it. The handbook’s second half offers 20 model lessons, each of which centers on a single document available online at the Society’s Turning Points in Wisconsin History collection (www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints). These lessons span all eras taught in U.S. history classes, connect local Wisconsin history to national themes in standard textbooks, and walk students and teachers through the analysis of eyewitness accounts with specific suggestions for developing critical thinking skills. Using primary sources, especially to develop critical thinking, is an unfamiliar practice in most secondary‐level history classes. History has traditionally been taught not as a practice in which students engage but rather as a collection of data that they master. ʺCome on, Bart,ʺ Marge Simpson says in a recent episode of the well‐known cartoon series, The Simpsons. ʺHistory can be fun. Itʹs like an amusement park except instead of rides, you get to memorize dates.ʺ (ʺMagical History Tour,ʺ which aired Dec. 22, 2004). Like Marge, we hate to admit that most kids find history boring and we try to persuade them that itʹs something they should enjoy. But, lulled by oversimplified generalizations and deadened by a stream of names and dates unrelated to their own lives, they know better than to believe us. It’s no wonder that they can be reluctant to engage original historical documents. ʺMy teacher made us use this Web site [American Journeys],ʺ one student told us through our feedback button. ʺIʹd rather have all the spinal fluid drained from my body.ʺ Itʹs sad that a young person with so much spunk, intelligence, and eloquence as that correspondent should miss the benefits that history has to offer, especially its potential to be a whetstone for sharpening critical intelligence. The past is rarely simple. There are usually more than two sides to a question: historical events are not neatly balanced rectangles but irregular polyhedrons that shift their shape as one changes oneʹs perspective. When students engage their minds on zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 4\n\n5. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com historical evidence, they practice inquiry, evaluation, problem solving, judgement, and synthesis ‐ ‐ the very skills needed to be a useful friend and an effective citizen. Historical documents are one of the easiest and most engaging ways to teach young people how to think clearly and make sound decisions. But because students donʹt usually see primary sources in history classes, they report in overwhelming numbers that history bores them. One former student called his history classes ʺabout as exciting as a clam race. All they wanted to talk about was numbers and dates. It ceased to be about people.ʺ (Roger Daltry in the New York Post, Oct 4, 2003). Using primary sources puts the people back in; real people, who actually ate breakfast, went to the bathroom, had passionate emotions, and were caught in terrible dilemmas. Their own words about their own lives will often seize a studentʹs attention. And by using eyewitness accounts that come from the studentʹs own city or county, or that were created by someone in their own ethnic group, or were written by a person of their own gender and age, teachers can quickly engage students with their past. This opens the door to helping them learn to think critically. No teenager cares about names and dates from the Civil War. But give him or her a manuscript letter written by an 18‐year‐old from the next town that describes his life in a Confederate prison, and their interest will pick up. Show them the iron collar that a Wisconsin soldier removed from an escaping slave and let them read what the slave said about where it came from, and their intelligence, imagination, and feelings will all shift into gear. Many will display a reaction like the very first we got to our American Journeys digital collection, from a student in Florida: ʺThis is soooo cool! Thanks!ʺ Causing these emotional reactions is one of the goals of the Wisconsin Historical Societyʹs digitization program. When a student experiences that ʺWow!ʺ or ʺAha!ʺ moment, they can be inspired to analyze, evaluate, and think critically ‐‐ skills that enrich them for an entire lifetime. As educators, weʹve encouraged kids for years to ʺmake smart choicesʺ without always teaching them the skills to do it. By middle and high school, theyʹre able to learn the elements of critical thinking; using historical documents that engage their hearts as well as their heads is a perfect method for teaching them.

Before you start looking at it closely, glance over the document and try to answer these questions. You may not be able to answer all five of them at first. 1. Who created it? Whoʹs it created for? In most texts, an authorʹs name appears near the top; sometimes, as with letters, it will be at the bottom instead. On pictures, the creatorʹs name may appear in a bottom corner, in a caption outside the image, or nowhere at all. The audience usually has to be inferred from the documentʹs content. Before reading closely, just browse the item to answer questions such as, was this a private communication or a published one? Is it aimed at young people or adults? Men or women? The general public or specialists? Any specific ethnic, cultural, or language group? Any specific professional group (such as scientists, lawyers, or legislators)? People in any specific place? 2. What kind of document is it? Published book? Speech? Private diary? Letter? Magazine article? Photograph? Map? Pamphlet? Advertisement? Political handout or flyer? Unpublished meeting minutes? Legal brief? Scientific report? Poster? 3. Where was it made, and where was it supposed to be distributed? Published works will usually have a title page, masthead, or byline; letters will usually have a return address. 4. When was it made? Do you know about anything else going on at the time? Published works will usually have a clear date somewhere near the beginning; letters will usually be dated at the top. 5. Why was it made? What do you suspect its creator was trying to accomplish? Simply inform a single reader? Change public opinion? Persuade influential decision‐ makers? Create a lasting historical record for posterity? Win a contest such as a court case or election? Educate a particular audience about new facts? Knowing these things about the document in advance helps you understand what it says and to begin to reach conclusions about its accuracy, completeness, biases, and point of view. zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 7\n\n8. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP TWO: Whatʹs The Main Point (or Points)? People write because they have something to say and make pictures because they have something to show. But the main points of a document are not always easy to spot. After addressing the Five Wʹs, examine the document this way: Texts 1. Look at the beginning. The main point may be plainly stated, or the author may pose a question he or she intends to answer. 2. Look at the end. There may be a short conclusion where the author sums everything up. 3. Look at the middle. Paragraphs may open with a topic sentence or end with a conclusion reached. Chapters may have entire paragraphs that do this. 4. Look for words that argue: ʺshould,ʺ ʺmust,ʺ ʺought,ʺ ʺnecessarily,ʺ ʺsurely.ʺ 5. Look for words that express causation or conclusion: ʺbecause,ʺ ʺand so,ʺ ʺconsequently,ʺ ʺtherefore,ʺ ʺin short,ʺ ʺin sum,ʺ ʺthus,ʺ ʺhence,ʺ ʺas a result,ʺ ʺin that case,ʺ ʺfor that reason,ʺ ʺthen,ʺ ʺaccordingly.ʺ 6. Look for words that express priorities: ʺessential,ʺ ʺimportant,ʺ ʺcrucial,ʺ ʺfundamental,ʺ ʺbasic.ʺ Pictures 1. Whatʹs the largest object? 2. What did the creator put dead center in the middle? 3. Whatʹs pushed off to the edges or into the background? 4. Pay attention to the way your eye wanders from one object to the next. Does this sequence make a point or tell a story? 5, Pay attention to your feelings as your eye wanders around. What objects in the pictures cause the most powerful reaction in you? When youʹre done, complete these statements: 1. ʺThe main thing the author or artist is trying to say or show is that ...ʺ 2. ʺTwo less important points are that ...ʺ zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 8\n\n9. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP THREE: Identifying Underlying Assumptions An authorʹs main points arenʹt usually too hard to find, but underlying assumptions are a different story. Occasionally theyʹre plainly stated at the outset but more often theyʹre taken for granted; after all, theyʹre ʺunderlying,ʺ not on the surface. To find them requires you to think and imagine more than to read and examine. Your guiding question during this activity is, ʺWhat else has to be true before the main points can be true?ʺ For example, if a plane crash survivor writes a memoir claiming that God saved her life, she has to first believe in God. If the person in the seat next to her was a scientist, his central point might be about physics and how the aircraft designersʹ foresight spared their lives. Sheʹd never say ʺI believe God intervenes in human affairs, therefore...ʺ or he say, ʺI believe in the laws of physics, therefore...ʺ They would both just take their starting assumptions for granted. How do you discover what the author of the document in front of you takes for granted? 1. Write down the main points or central propositions you identified in step two. Then ask yourself, what would a person have to believe first in order for those statements to be true? 2. Consider the intended audience. Does that group hold any values in common that the author would take for granted? Speeches about abortion given at ʺRight To Lifeʺ or ʺReproductive Freedomʺ rallies would start from different assumptions because their audiences do. If an author knows the audience already shares many values, beliefs, or desires, these may not be plainly stated in the document; theyʹll be taken for granted 3. Look for the authorʹs values: what he or she considers good and bad, desirable and undesirable. If a main point is ʺDonʹt take drugsʺ then one of the authorʹs values must be that drugs are bad. 4. Values are always established by some standards: something is the best, something is the worst, and everything else spreads out in between. What words are used to describe the very best outcome, characteristic, or situation? What is held up as the biggest obstacle or greatest threat to that? 5. Look for the authorʹs biases and prejudices: the values that are so important that the author doesnʹt even explain or defend them. These are sometimes easy to spot, as when an author forcefully denounces an opposing point of view without offering much, or any, evidence. Strong statements that arenʹt backed by explanation or evidence are usually biases. zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 9\n\n11. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP FOUR: Identifying Point of View Almost every creator of a document embraces a cluster of beliefs, desires, and values that go together. This is his or her conceptual framework, or point of view, which is usually shared by a community of like‐minded people. We often hang labels on these worldviews such as ʺliberalʺ or ʺconservative,ʺ and we group people who share them under headings like ʺhippiesʺ or ʺIslamic Fundamentalists.ʺ These labels are always too simplistic; lifeʹs simply more complicated than that. But identifying a documentʹs basic point of view is nevertheless important because it enables you to connect it with established patterns of thinking. Answering the question ʺWhere are they coming from?ʺ permits you to understand a document by putting it in a context. 1. Look at the audience you identified and the purpose you discovered in step one. Look at the lists of main points and assumptions you drew up in steps two and three. What do they have in common? Do they make a pattern that you can name or recognize? 2. Look at the document again, noting any buzz words, jargon, or key vocabulary repeated throughout it. Is there a cluster of key concepts in those often‐used terms? 3. What authorities does the writer appeal to or use as examples ‐ ‐ scientists, historical figures, religious leaders, fictional heroes, previous writers? What do you know about their points of view? 4. What do the main points and underlying assumptions seem to be on the following pairs of issues: ‐ freedom vs. authority ‐ obeying the law vs. obeying oneʹs ‐ equality vs. merit conscience ‐ personal liberty vs. public order ‐ tolerance vs. imposed standards ‐ local region vs. nation ‐ civic duty vs. private gain ‐ individual rights vs. common good ‐ obligation vs. pleasure 5. Hundreds of ways exist to classify conceptual frameworks and worldviews. Try to identify the authorʹs point of view using a well‐known label like one of these (or another). atheist liberal Christian libertarian conservative Marxist fascist progressive feminist reactionary Freudian scientific humanist utopian zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 11\n\n12. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP FIVE: Evaluating Reasoning A. Finding the Argument Most documents try to make a point or reach a conclusion by offering reasons. They make an argument, a series of points that advocate something. Hereʹs a famous example used in philosophy classes for 2000 years: Premise 1: ʺAll men are mortalʺ Premise 2: ʺSocrates is a manʺ Conclusion: ʺTherefore, Socrates is mortalʺ This three‐part argument is called a syllogism. Hereʹs a well‐known graduation joke: ʺOf course thereʹs a lot of knowledge in universities: the freshmen bring a little in; the seniors donʹt take much away, so knowledge sort of accumulates.ʺ (early 20th‐c. Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell): Premise 1: Freshmen bring a little (knowledge) in Premise 2: Seniors take none away Premise 3: Knowledge accumulates Conclusion: Thereʹs a lot of knowledge in universities Look back over the lists of central points and assumptions you identified earlier. Youʹll probably see some conclusions supported by some premises. The premises try to provide justification, evidence, or support for the conclusion; they may be among the underlying assumptions you discovered. Answer these questions: 1. What is the authorʹs most important point, central proposition, or main conclusion ‐ ‐ the big one that prompted him or her to create the text? 2. What premises does it rest on? What reasons does the author give to persuade you that you should agree with it? 3. Try restating the premises and conclusions as in the examples above. zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 12\n\n13. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com B. Examining the Argumentʹs Logic Bad arguments donʹt make sense. “Making sense” means that one point follows logically from another and that the conclusion follows from the premises. If Iʹm in Wisconsin and tell you, ʺI have to go to Chicago so Iʹm heading north,ʺ youʹll think Iʹm weird. The conclusion (head north) doesnʹt follow logically from the premise (go from Wisconsin to Chicago). Bad arguments fall into well‐known patterns called fallacies that are described on the next sheet, ʺCommon Errors of Logic in Argumentative Writing.ʺ Sound or valid arguments, on the other hand, are reasonable; they follow the rules of logic. There are two main patterns of valid argument, deductive and inductive. In a ʺdeductiveʺ argument, the premises inevitably prove the conclusion; logically, they canʹt lead anywhere else and the conclusion needs no other support (like the Socrates example, above). In contrast, the premises of an ʺinductive” argument only suggest or point to a conclusion without proving it beyond all doubt; usually they rely on probability to help the reader infer ‐‐ make a logical leap to ‐‐ the conclusion. Example: ʺIʹm almost never late for school, so I wonʹt be late today.ʺ In fact, you might end up late even though you probably wonʹt; thereʹs no causal connection between the premise (almost never) and the conclusion (I wonʹt be late today). Instead, you have to make a leap of faith between the two. Look at the argument that you outlined above and try to answer these questions about it: 1. Are the authorʹs premises clear? Are they true? Are they supported by any evidence? 2.. Does the conclusion follow logically from the premises? 3. How many of the logical errors listed on the next sheet does the author commit? zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 13\n\n14. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com 10 Common Errors of Logic in Argumentative Writing adapted from Steve Moiles, Southern Illinois University (www.siue.edu/~smoiles/fallac.html) 1. Hasty Generalization: basing conclusions on irrelevant, incomplete, or inaccurate evidence: ʺMy account canʹt be overdrawn; I still have checks left.ʺ 2. Faulty Cause and Effect: assuming that because B follows A in time, A must be the cause of B: ʺAfter thousands of immigrants came to the U.S., the Civil War broke out. Immigration caused the Civil War.ʺ 3. Reductive Reasoning: reducing a complex effect to a single cause: ʺDrug abuse wouldnʹt be a problem if kids would just say no.ʺ 4. False Analogies: comparing two things that are more different than they are similar: ʺWhy do I have to take certain courses before I can graduate? No one requires me to buy certain groceries before I can leave the supermarket.ʺ 5. Circular reasoning: restating the conclusion instead of supporting it: ʺHe can’t be married, he’s a bachelor.ʺ 6. Equivocation: using a term in a completely different way than oneʹs opponent uses it: ʺI shouldnʹt be prosecuted for stealing a copy of the Detroit Free Press. Weʹre guaranteed our right to a free press by the Constitution.ʺ 7. Ad Hominem Argument: attacking the opponent personally rather than his or her argument: ʺThe president’s economic stimulus program shouldn’t be taken seriously. He had an affair with a White House intern, after all.ʺ 8. False Either/Or Argument: assuming that only two alternatives exist in a complex situation: ʺEither we support the death penalty or we allow crime to run rampant.ʺ 9. Bandwagon Appeal: arguing that readers should accept something because it is popular: ʺ80% of the American public are practicing Christians, so God must exist.ʺ 10. Begging the Question: avoiding the point to be proven: “Q: Why are you banging on that pan so loudly?” “A: To keep the wild tigers away.” “Q: There aren’t any wild tigers in Wisconsin!” “Q: Works really well, doesn’t it?” zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 14\n\n15. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com C. Examining the Argumentʹs Clarity Sound arguments use plain language and are clearly expressed. Ask how well your document meets the following important criteria: 1. Definition of terms. Does the author clearly explain what he or she means by key vocabulary? Does the author use terms that are vague or terms that are precise (ʺChristianʺ vs. ʺRoman Catholicʺ; ʺscienceʺ vs. ʺmolecular biologyʺ)? Terms that can mean different things to different people (ʺliberation,ʺ ʺterroristʺ)? Emotionally charged terms that refer to ambiguous generalities (ʺfreedom,ʺ ʺthe American Dreamʺ)? 2. Precision: Does the author use sentences that have a single plain meaning (ʺ25 of the 37 people present reported that...ʺ) or vague and over‐simplified ones (ʺMost people would surely agree that...ʺ)? Are his or her statements confused or nonsensical (ʺAlthough Iʹm an only child, if I had a sister I know she would like cheeseʺ)? 3. Logical consistency: Do propositions contradict one another? Does the author make a claim in one place, and then make another claim elsewhere that contradicts the first one? 4. Relevance: How closely do the examples given, authorities cited, and evidence offered relate to the issue under discussion? Is the document padded with powerful language or emotional examples that donʹt focus on the central question? Unclear premises, unsupported conclusions, faulty logic, vague or ambiguous terminology, and emotionally charged, unclear, or irrelevant statements are reasons to doubt an authorʹs conclusions. zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 15\n\n16. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com D. Glossary Argument: A series of points that advocate something. Point: A statement or a proposition. Premise: A preliminary point that justifies a conclusion; often there are a series of these leading logically from one to another. Conclusion: The final point that claims to be true because of the premises. Deductive (‐tion): An argument where the premises logically prove the conclusion. To say the conclusion didnʹt follow from the premises would be nonsense. Entail (‐ment): Premises in a deductive argument are said to ʺentailʺ the conclusion because the conclusion is a logical and necessary consequence of the premises Inductive (‐tion): An argument where the premises only suggest or support the conclusion without absolutely proving it. The conclusion may be very likely but is not logically inescapable. Infer (‐ence): Mental activity in which a reader extrapolates from premises to a conclusion, making a logical leap; usually inferences are based on probability: ʺonly one airplane in 10,000 crashes, so itʹs safe for me to fly today.ʺ Inferences can be strong (that is, very likely) or weak (not so likely). Fallacy: An illogical or unreliable argument; see ʺ10 Common Errors of Logic in Argumentative Writing.ʺ Syllogism: A 3‐part argument with a major premise and a minor premise leading to a conclusion zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 16\n\n17. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP SIX: Evaluating Inferences The most persuasive arguments are deductive, and contain logical proof of their conclusion: ʺIf 2 + 2 = 4, then 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.ʺ No other conclusion is logically possible and no other proof is needed. But most arguments are not so certain: their premises donʹt prove their conclusion through inescapable logic but only lead up to, or imply, it. In these arguments we have to ʺinferʺ a conclusion by extrapolating from the premises. These ʺinductiveʺ arguments can be based on limited causal reasons or on analogies, but they are usually based on probability: ʺOnly one airplane in 100,000 crashes, so itʹs safe for me to fly today.ʺ There is no ironclad logical proof between the premise and the conclusion here. My plane could, in fact, be the very one in 100,000 that crashes next. But itʹs probably safe for me to fly today anyway. Inferences can be strong (that is, very likely) or weak (not so likely). Strong inferences have good evidence of likelihood behind them, such as research, statistical testing, or wide experience. Weak inferences show less evidence and rely more on hope, faith, or trust than on demonstrated probability. When a jury is instructed to decide a defendantʹs fate ʺbeyond a reasonable doubt,ʺ the judge is asking them not to convict unless they have deductive proof or a strong inference of guilt. Look at the arguments you identified in your document and answer these questions: 1. Does the author ever use a deductive argument (one in which the conclusion is logically inescapable if the premises are true)? 2. Does the author ever use an inductive argument (one in which the conclusion must be inferred from the premises)? 3. Is the authorʹs inference a strong one? Reliance inferences more often than on proof, and relying on weak inferences rather than strong ones, are reasons to doubt an authorʹs conclusions. zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 17\n\n18. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP SEVEN: Evaluating Evidence The evidence an author offers the reader should answer the question, ʺHow do you know?ʺ Documents can contain two types of evidence, personal experience and appeals to authority. Through description of his or her own experience, direct quotations, or references to other sources, an author establishes his or her credibility. Personal Experiences Eyewitness accounts and other primary sources are often full of interest and emotionally powerful. But that doesnʹt make them true. Different witnesses often have different versions of the same event. To evaluate the reliability of a first‐hand report, assess these characteristics of it: Proximity: Was the author actually there? was he or she in a position to know? Timeliness: How soon after the event was the evidence created? Breadth: How much of the event could the author have experienced, the whole thing or only a tiny part? Whatʹs likely to have been ignored, covered up, highlighted, or over‐emphasized? Clarity: Does the author clearly explain who, what, where, when, and why? Point of View: What might the author choose to omit (or not even have noticed) because of his or her worldview? Bias: What beliefs, desires, or values may have influenced the authorʹs perceptions or descriptions? Appeal to the Experiences of Others Most historical documents also use arguments based on the experiences of people other than the author. To assess their reliability, apply the questions above to the sources the author quotes; how trustworthy are they? Then evaluate how the author uses evidence from external authorities: Relevance: Are the sources quoted actually about the main topic, or are they brought in from some other context? Do they strengthen the argumentʹs logic or simply drop names? Breadth: Does the author provide a wide range of authorities or a narrow range? zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 18\n\n19. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com Completeness: Does the author admit there may be conflicting evidence and explain why he or she rejects it, or are contradictory sources just silently omitted? Documentation: Does the author identify sources of evidence in footnotes or other citations accurately enough for you to locate and examine them yourself? Apply the tests described above to a modern or a historical document, then answer these questions: 1. What types of evidence does the author give? 2. Is the evidence directly relevant to the central question or main point? 3. Is the evidence from knowledgeable and trustworthy sources? 4. How much does the evidence help persuade you that the authorʹs main conclusions are correct? Insufficient, untrustworthy, incomplete, or irrelevant evidence and poor documentation (such as lack of footnotes or other clear references to sources of information) are reasons to doubt an authorʹs conclusions. zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 19\n\n20. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP EIGHT: Assessing Completeness Many documents present only one point of view, and perhaps acknowledge an opposing viewpoint only long enough to reject it. But most important issues have more than two sides: they are not like simple straight lines demanding a choice between black and white, but rather like irregular polyhedrons with many different sides, some more important and complicated than others. Deciding which side of an issue to take and which aspects to leave out is a judgement, and in that simple choice lies much of a documentʹs meaning. A merchant recalling a trip might include many details about goods and prices while a scientist traveling beside him mainly describes the plants and animals they encountered. What is omitted tells us about the creator’s priorities and values. In a document thatʹs meant to persuade, completeness is reflected in the argumentʹs depth and breadth. By depth we mean how well it addresses the complexities of the topic. By breadth we mean how well it addresses other perspectives or approaches to the topic. To assess the completeness of any document, you need to rely on your own knowledge and understanding of the subject as well as your creativity and imagination. Locate a short essay such as an encyclopedia article on the topic that your document is about. If it is about Wisconsin history, youʹll find reliable short summaries of all important events at www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints. Your U.S. history textbook may also have a few pages or paragraphs about the events that produced the document. Read these, then review the documentʹs main points and the audience and point of view you identified. Look at the lists of premises and conclusions you compiled. Then answer the following questions about the documentʹs completeness: 1. Omissions: What has been left out by the author that is mentioned in the encyclopedia articles or textbook? How important is this missing information? If it had been included, how would the argument be different? Would its premises or conclusion change? 2. Depth: Does the author take into account all the complexities of the main issue, or simplify it? How important are the omissions to an understanding of the issue? Are there important related questions that the author doesnʹt talk about at all? 3. Breadth: Does the author take into account other points of view? Are there alternative ways to understand the problem, or to try to solve it? If the author does talk about such alternatives, are they treated clearly, carefully, and in depth? What point of view or conclusion would directly oppose the authorʹs? Does he or she specifically talk about that viewpoint and explain to your satisfaction why it has been rejected? zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 20\n\n21. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP NINE: Imagining Implications The implications of a conclusion are the things that would follow if the conclusion is true: ʺIf this were so, what else would happen?ʺ In other words, where does the argument lead? If ʺmight makes rightʺ is a true conclusion and the most powerful people in society ought to control social life, here are a few implications: ‐ society will always be at war, as forces compete for control; ‐ weak or non‐combative people will have no say in public affairs; ‐ democratic elections will not be needed. If the main point advocated in your document came true, then what would follow? If the author’s preferred outcome is accomplished, what else will follow? How will the world be different? Take a few minutes to do the following: 1. Restate the main point in your own words 2. List several implications of it. 3. Do the implications produce an unsupportable conclusion or undesirable outcome? zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 21\n\n22. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com STEP TEN: Taking a Stand Analyzing and understanding other peopleʹs texts and pictures is only the first half of critical thinking. The other half is being able to present your own thoughts in a way that is clear, accurate, thorough, and makes sense. To do this, you need to turn the preceding nine steps on their head: instead of asking questions to see if a document embodies good critical thinking, you need to express your own ideas that way. Select a proposition or a claim advanced in a historical document: ʺslavery should be abolished,ʺ ʺschools should teach classes only in English,ʺ ʺgovernment authority comes from the consent of the government,ʺ ʺwomen should not be allowed to vote,ʺ etc. Or take a controversial issue in the news today: ʺgay couples should be allowed to marry,ʺ ʺabortions should be outlawed,ʺ ʺthe U.S. should withdraw from Iraq,ʺ ʺsmoking should be prohibited in public places,ʺ etc. Phrase your claim as a simple proposition and then do the following: 1. Prepare a short paragraph that puts the issue in context ‐ ‐ explaining ʺwho, what, where, when, and whyʺ ‐ ‐ in a very concise way, not more than a short sentence on each of the five Wʹs (all five may not be applicable). 2. What will be the key terms and concepts in your discussion of this topic? Write a very brief definition of each. 3. For your conclusion to be true, what premises must be true? List the premises, including any underlying assumptions, beliefs, desires, and values you have about the issue (examples: ʺabortion should be outlawed because: 1, abortion is murder; 2, murder breaks one of the Ten Commandments; 3, Iʹm a Christian who believes in thoseʺ) 4. How do you know youʹre right? What evidence might you need to collect in order to discover if your premises are true? 5. How does your conclusion follow from your premises? Do the premises *logically prove* the conclusion is inescapable (deductions)? Or do the premises *only suggest* the conclusion is likely (inferences)? 6. What other points of view, evidence, and conclusions might be possible on this topic? List them. What would make you choose one point of view rather than another? 7. If your conclusion is correct, what would happen next? What implications does your argument suggest? zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 22\n\n23. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com Part III Nurturing Critical Thinking in the Classroom 30 Classroom Techniques That Encourage Critical Thinking p. 24 pedagogical devices that demand thinking from students Encouraging Critical Thinking during Discussions p. 26 getting students to think on their feet Encouraging Critical Thinking through Assignment Instructions p. 27 getting students to think at the keyboard Evaluating Critical Thought p. 28 getting students to recognize clear thinking zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 23\n\n24. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com 1. 30 Classroom Techniques That Encourage Critical Thinking Adapted from The Miniature Guide for Those Who Teach on Practical Ways to Promote Active & Cooperative Learning by Wesley Hiler and Richard Paul (Sonoma State Univ.: Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2002) and Using Internet Primary Sources to Teach Critical Thinking Skills in History by Kathleen W. Craver (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood, 1999) 1. Start classes with a question: set up anticipation before class begins. 2. Assign questions for them to answer about their reading: ʺexplain why and how...ʺ 3. Give a 5‐minute quiz at the start of class (keeps students engaged). 4. Use charts and graphics (visual learners abound). 5. Have them play roles: give a speech as if they were the author of the document. 6. Have them identify premises, assumptions and conclusions in todayʹs newspaper. 7. Have them evaluate reasoning, evidence, and completeness in todayʹs newspaper. 8. Use index cards to call on all students randomly. 9. Make students figure things out in class (combine them into small groups to discuss solutions). 10. Interview each other and restate the other personʹs views to the class. 11. Talk less; give them time to think about what youʹve said . 12. Model critical thinking: think aloud on your feet in front of them. 13. Use Socratic questioning: ʺWhat precisely do you mean?ʺ ʺHow do you know?ʺ ʺWhat is your reason?ʺ ʺWhat else has to be true for that to be so?ʺ etc. 14. Promote collaboration: have small groups solve problems and adopt positions. 15. Use pyramid teaching: discuss in pairs, then small groups, then larger groups. zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 24\n\n26. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com 2.

Though they can take many different forms, primary documents all share the common characteristic of being firsthand evidence. Primary sources are contrasted with ʺsecondary sources,ʺ or information produced by people who were not participants in the events described, such as classroom textbooks or scholarly articles. Examples of primary sources include: books produced at the time interviews pamphlets songs magazine articles photographs newspaper stories engravings letters maps diaries cartoons government reports advertisements laws posters speeches museum objects As this list suggests, primary sources come in many types ‐‐ printed publications, handwritten manuscripts, graphical images, museum artifacts, sound and video recordings, etc. The Wisconsin Historical Society has made tens of thousands of primary sources available on its Web site for free. The most helpful collection for use with this handbook is Turning Points in Wisconsin History located at www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints Turning Points contains digital reproductions of roughly 1,000 primary sources on Wisconsin events, including nearly all the types listed above. You can browse through it using DPIʹs ten main themes for teaching Wisconsin history, or search it by typing zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/ 29\n\n30. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com keywords into search boxes or by opening drop‐down menus. There are eyewitness accounts from all eras in U.S. and Wisconsin history, and documents or museum artifacts from every historical period over the last 5,000 years. There are primary sources from nearly every Wisconsin county (type the county name in the search box), and a large number of diaries, memoirs and other eyewitness accounts written by young people. Youʹll discover primary sources from every major ethnic group, and written by women, children, and working‐class people whose voices are not often heard in the standard textbooks. Youʹll also find short background essays on more than 50 pivotal events in Wisconsin history (who, what, where, when, why), annotations explaining each primary source (where it came from and why it’s important), 100 modern reference maps, an online Dictionary of Wisconsin History, dozens of lesson plans, and the entire contents of this handbook. A set of pages at Turning Points called “Using Primary Sources” offers more advice on how to utilize them in the classroom, including masters of “document analysis worksheets” that you can print off and duplicate. Other online collections of Wisconsin primary sources available for free at the Societyʹs Web site are listed at http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/collections.asp. These include 15,000 photographs and other images from the Society Archives, hundreds of paintings and thousands of pieces of clothing from the Society Museum, 50,000 pages of Wisconsin newspaper stories from the Society Library, and hundreds of rare books and manuscripts.

Between 1534 and 1673 the French invaded North America in search of furs and souls. Their occupation began at seaboard villages, grew with the founding of Quebec in 1608, and rapidly spread to the Great Lakes. By 1622, when the Mayflower Pilgrims had barely moved a mile inland from Plymouth harbor, French explorer Etienne Brule was skirting the Wisconsin shore of Lake Superior. French exploration culminated in the famous voyage of Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet down the Mississippi in 1673. After that, led by the explorer LaSalle, the French built a great arc of military camps and trading posts that stretched from Newfoundland west through the Great Lakes and south to New Orleans. Down that curve trickled fur traders and missionaries, and back up it flowed thousands of beaver, marten, otter, and other skins. For the next century and a half, French culture and commerce dominated ʺOuisconsin.ʺ Background Reading: ʺArrival of the First Europeansʺ http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp‐006/?action=more_essay Document to Analyze: ʺThe Mississippi Voyage of Jolliet and Marquette.ʺ http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=370 Who, What, Where, When, Why: Father Jacques Marquette wrote this document as the clean copy of a journal he kept on the voyage; it was intended for his superiors in the Jesuit Order, and he expected it to be published. It began as a journal but because this copy was drafted afterwards, it at times reads like a letter or report. Most portions were composed around the campfire after the dayʹs events during the summer of 1673, while other parts are summaries written up to a year later. It was created to describe new things seen for the first time, as a documentary record of the trip.

Indians traded their pelts to French‐Canadians for trade goods such as metal knives, guns, bullets, and brandy. Soldiers were quartered here to keep the peace, and missionaries were sent to convert the Indians. Indians who had lived for centuries in stable communities scattered through the forest in pursuit of furs while their dependents clustered around French forts where they encountered European germs, alcohol, and sexual exploitation. When a winterʹs worth of beaver skins were traded in the spring, Indian hunters often found they only paid the previous yearʹs debts and had to borrow again to obtain ammunition and other basic necessities to last through the next winter.

He moved in 1686 to the western Great Lakes and helped bring peace to the region. French officials, soldiers, and fur traders all reaped handsome profits at the expense of the Indians, and Carheil was a leading voice in the 1690s for reform. He was ineffective, however, and left the west in 1702 to spend the rest of his life in Quebec. In this long letter, he tries to persuade officials to curb the excesses of soldiers and traders by giving graphic accounts of their abuses. He is writing from Mackinaw, at the head of Lake Michigan, but describing conditions across the region; we can safely assume these abuses were happening at Green Bay, LaPointe, and elsewhere in Wisconsin.

Introduction: In 1787, the Founding Fathers created the U.S. Constitution, the first rulebook for organizing power not from the top down but from the bottom up, through the will of the people. Every new state also needed a constitution, and in 1846 Wisconsin’s leaders tried to decide fundamental laws for the new region. At the time, women had no legal rights under most governments. As long as a woman lived at home, all her possessions and any money she earned belonged to her father; after marriage, they belonged to her husband. Some people drafting Wisconsinʹs constitution tried to insert an article allowing married women to own their own property, such as money earned or inherited. Voters rejected the draft constitution containing this controversial provision but similar legal protections were soon passed by the state legislature.

Strong, a delegate to the 1846 constitutional convention from Racine, who believed that a woman’s proper place was in the care of her husband. Early in the legislative session of 1847, Strong made this speech arguing that women’s property rights were not only unrepresentative of majority opinion, but sure to produce only “evil.” Strong resigned from the convention before its close when his objections were not heeded Related Documents: Agricola. ʺʹAgricolaʹsʹ Views on Rights of Married Women [February 27, 1847].ʺ http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=56 and Wisconsin.
