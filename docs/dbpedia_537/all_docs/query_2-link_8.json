        "text": "SAVUDRIJA (45° 30’N; 13° 30’E), village (pop. 349 in 1991) and small harbour N of point of the same name (round, white stone lighthouse, with top gallery, white flashes).\n\nMooring: The harbour is exposed to SW and NW wind. In other winds suitable as shelter for small craft only. Mooring at pier (depth 2.5m), at north part of pier with four-point moor.\n\nWarning: When entering harbour care should be taken to avoid shoals extending about 1.2M offshore from the point. Customs and registration should be made previously in Umag. A large tourist settlement with a motel, bungalows and a campsite is situated near the point.\n\nUMAG (45° 26’N; 13° 31’E), town (pop. 4,838 in 1991) and harbour on NW shore of Istrian Peninsula.\n\nApproach: Landmarks: the hotel complex N of the harbour, Adriatic hotel in the harbour, church belfry surmounted by a pyramidal point, factory chimney S of town, green tower with column (green light) at head of breakwater, red tower with column (red light) and gallery at head of marina breakwater, square white tower (red light) on main pier of harbour.\n\nWhen entering harbour care should be taken of a number of shoals. The western edge of the Paklena (hellish) shoal on the north entrance to the harbour is marked by a cylindrical red tower with a column and gallery (white-red sector light) on a white stone base; the southern edge of the rocky Garofulin shoal, also on the north entrance, is marked by a yellow and black post and two cones, points downwards, (sea is shallow to about 60m south of marker).\n\nIncoming yachts should enter harbour passing between the red, conical light-buoy (must be left to port) and the green, conical signal buoy (must be left to starboard). Only after passing the green conical light buoy (leave to starboard) course may be shaped for the pier; at night, until the red light on its head is sighted. Depth of the entrance channel is 4m and more.\n\nMooring: The harbour is sheltered from all winds and sea except N and NNW. The bora may be strong but does not create waves. Summer storms are short but dangerous and form waves in the harbour. Yachts can moor beside the pier and on the east side of the quay. The pier is reserved for coastal and excursion yachts; in the sum- mer season it is used by customs authorities. Yachts and smaller yachts are advised to moor in the marina (north part of har- bour). There is good anchorage in the centre of the harbour (depth 35m). Larger yachts are advised to anchor about 0.6M west of the Umag belfry (depth 18m). At night they should anchor 2M west of the harbour (depth 27m). This anchorage provides shelter from the bora but at first signs of a S or SW wind yachts should weigh and leave.\n\nUmag is a permanent port of entry and has harbour master’s branch office, customs, post office, hospital, out-patients’ department, chemist’s, bank, hotels and hotel settlements (Katoro, 1 M north of harbour), casino, camp for motorists.

Approaching yachts should be careful to avoid the Dajla (Pasador) shoal extending 400m NW of Dajla point; the northwest edge of this is marked by a yellow conical buoy with black band round the middle. This should be left to starboard.\n\nMooring: This shallow bay provides good shelter from the bora and the sirocco but is exposed to W wind and sea. Yachts may land in the NE part of the harbour (Spic), and moor at the head of the small pier (four-point moor), depth 2m at pier head, or anchor in the middle of the bay (depths 78 m) with a good holding bottom.\n\nFacilities: Local shops, water in the hotel centre. Fuel and all other requirements in Umag or Novigrad.\n\nSights: Ruins of ancient buildings.\n\nNOVIGRAD (45° 19’N; 13° 34’E), town (pop. 2,522 in 1991) and har- bour (on the peninsula on the S side of the bay).\n\nApproach: Novigrad can be identified by ruins of the town walls, church belfry and white, eight-sided concrete tower (sector light) at the head of the breakwater and a white tower with column and gallery (green light) on the head of the pier.\n\nCare should be taken to avoid two shoals at the harbour entrance: Val shoal (WSW of harbour) is marked by a cylindrical black buoy with red line roud the middle, topped with two black spheres; Meja shoal (at the root of the outer side of the breakwater). When approaching at night yachts should keep within the white sector of the light on the breakwater head. The Val shoal is covered by its red sector and the Meja shoal by its green sector. Mooring: The harbour is protected from all winds except W and NW which cause a surge in the harbour. As soon the first signs of N and NW winds are noticed yachts should transfer to Novigrad mar- ina. Yachts drawing up to 3.5m may moor along the breakwater, near the head, and on the NE side of the pier (four-point moor). The pier is also used by coastal and excursion yachts, and in sum- mer for customs. The best anchorage is about 200m NE of the pier (depth 34m\n\nNovigrad is a seasonal port of entry; customs, harbour master’s branch office, post office; medical service, chemist’s.

There are steep red cliffs E of Pod Uliki point one mile E of Novigrad harbour and a lighthouse (sector light on corner of single-storey hous of lighthouse keeper) on Zub point (Rt Zub).\n\nYachts approaching from the north should take care to avoid the Val shoal, marked by a cylindrical black buoy with a red band in the middle, topped with two black spheres. At night this shoal is in the red sector of the harbour light (on the breakwater) in Novigrad harbour. Yachts approaching from the south should take care to avoid the Civran and Veliki skolj shoals lying about 1.6M south of Zub point.\n\nMooring: Mirna bay affords small craft shelter from all winds except those from the W which cause rough water. Larger craft are advised to anchor north of Valeta cove (depth 1718m) or in front of Stari Tar village. Smaller yachts can anchor near the S shore or in the Tar cove which is shallow (alluvial deposits). Anchorage about 1.6M south of Zub point. Yachts are advised to leave at the first signs of a W wind.\n\nOn the left bank of the Mirna, below the little hill town of Motovun, there is Motovun forest, a special forestry reserve; around Istarske Toplice there is a nature reserve.\n\nCRVAR or CERVAR (45° 17′ N; 13° 36′ E), a long narrow inlet SE of point Zub. It forms two branches Lunga and Sveta Marina.\n\nApproach: Yachts approaching from the north will see a light- house (single-storey building with white and red sector light) on Zub point, a holiday settlement S of the lighthouse, the build- ings of the hotel centre and the Cervar-Porat marina in the S part of Lunga. The large rocky shoal on the S side of the entrance to the inlet, the northern part of which is called Veliki skolj and the southern Civran, is dangerous for all yachts. NW of Veliki skolj shoal there is cylindrical green buoy (green light) topped by a cone pointing upwards. Both shoals are easily spotted because of the waves breaking over the rocks. On the SW edge of the Civran shoal is a yellow buoy with a black band (white light) in the middle, topped with two black cones, their points upwards. The shoals are in the red sectors of the lighthouses on Zub point and coastal light on Barbaran cliff, and must be left to starboard on entering Crvar. The marina should be approached by a course in the middle of the inlet.\n\nMooring: The inlet is protected from all winds except those from NW, depth in centre about 18m, and at marina entrance 14m. For about 200m along the north shore the sea is shallow (2m).\n\nFacilities: Water and provisions in a supermarket in the village. General repairs in Cervar-Porat marina.\n\nCERVAR-PORAT MARINA lies at the very end of the SE part of Crvar inlet, about 3M south of Novigrad harbour. It is well protected from all winds except that from the NW which causes a heavy swell in the marina and makes entrance difficult.\n\nThe marina has 300 sea-berths and about 50 dry-berths. Electri- city and water hook-ups. Anchoring in the marina is forbidden. Small craft can anchor N of the marina in Sveta Marina cove (depth 6m) or N of the cove (depth 15m).\n\nThe marina has reception office, a hotel with a restaurant, snack-bar, coffee-bar, toilets and showers, sports grounds, self-service shop.\n\nServices include two cranes (5 and 10 t), equipment for transport and berthing of craft on land.

By the belfry with turret in the town, by a red cylindri- cal tower (white and red sector lights) on Barbaran cliff and a white concrete tower with green cupola (green light) on the head of the breakwater (islet of Sveti Nikola).\n\nYachts approaching from the N should take care to avoid the Meja shoal about one mile NNW of the harbour, the middle is marked by a black spar with two red bands topped by two black spheres. At night this shoal is covered by the red sector of the light on Barbaran cliff. About 0.5M from the Meja shoal care should be taken to avoid the Pical shoal (depth 2.4m). Yachts should keep well over to the west of the alignment of Rt point and Busuja point until abreast of Pical point. After that course can be shaped for the harbour. Yachts approaching from the south should take care to avoid the Bekarija shoal about 0.3M south of the islet of Sveti Nikola and marked with a black spar with two red bands and topped by two black spheres. There are underwater pipes and cables between the shore and Sveti Nikola.\n\nThere are four approaches to the harbour; the safest being the channel between Barbaran cliff and the head of the north breakwa- ter on Sveti Nikola islet. At night this channel is in the white sector (62° to 153°) of the light on Barbaran.\n\nMooring: The harbour is protected from NE and to some extent from SW and NW. Winds from S and NW create high waves. The sirocco here is more frequent than the bora wich blows very strongly, especially in autumn. In summer during the sirocco SW squalls may be experienced and these cause high waves in the harbour. Strong sea currents may make maneuvring difficult in the harbour. Yachts drawing up to 5m can moor at the quay in front of the Rivijera Hotel and those drawing up to 4m at the pier which also serves coastal and excursion yachts and for customs. There is anchorage in the middle of the harbour but it is not recommended as there is no good holding bottom.
