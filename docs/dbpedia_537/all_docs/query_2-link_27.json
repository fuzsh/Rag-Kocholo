        "text": "In a volume dedicated to the question whether the Council of Europeâ€™s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (hereinafter: FCNM) can be considered (to develop into) a useful pan-European instrument, a contribution assessing the 'added value' of that Convention is everything but superfluous. Evaluating the 'added value' can be done from several interrelated perspectives, including the added value in relation to other minority- specific instruments, and in relation to instruments that are not minority specific but nevertheless of special relevance to minorities. This contribution uses as a central reference point the two basic pillars of minority protection, more specifically the prohibition of discrimination in combination with general human rights as a first pillar, and conditio sine qua non for the second pillar consisting of minority specific rights."
