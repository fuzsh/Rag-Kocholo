PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE COMMUNICATION: a thirteen letter word that can improve the patient- physician relationship and lead to better health care and lower medical costs. COMMUNICATION; as important to physicians as a medical license or hospital privileges. Often more reassuring to patients than medica- tion or treatment. To help patients communicate more effectively with their physicians, the Arizona Medical Association has developed two patient information brochures, HOW TO CUT YOUR HEALTH CARE COSTS and THE PATIENT-PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP, A WORKING PARTNERSHIP The brochures offer advice on telephoning and visiting the doctor’s office, discussing fees, and exchanging information. They also answer frequently asked questions concerning health care costs, what physicians are doing about the problem, and how patients can help in the effort. ArMA is making quantities of the brochures available to members at 1 0 cents each or $1 0.00 per hundred. To order your supply, mall the attached coupon to ArMA.

The data demonstrated an operative lortality of 1.17% with a perioperative myocardial ifarction rate of 7.1%.

Two patients died late after perations, for a two-year survival of 96.69%. We conclude that age is not a contraindication to oronary artery bypass surgery, that surgery can be erformed with a low perioperative mortality and nfarction rate and that long-term follow-up for quality if life is similar to that in a younger population indergoing similar surgery.

Introduction Advanced age has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.^'® As a result the elderly patient with severe ischemic heart disease is only considered for coronary revascularization while elective surgery is discouraged. With the advances in surgical technique, myocardial preservation, and postoperative care, surgery has become much safer, even for the elderly. This report details the surgical results and complications of coronary artery bypass surgery in patients over 65 years of age. Methods The charts of all patients over 65 years of age who have undergone coronary revascularization at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center from July 1977 to March 1981 were reviewed. Any patient who had an additional procedure, i.e., valve replacement or carotid endarterectomy, was excluded from the study. Eighty-five patients were finally selected for review of hospital charts, operative reports, and clinic records. Follow-up was accomplished by personal or telephone interview and was completed in 80 of 84 (95%) of survivors. The coronary artery bypass procedure for all patients was the same and is as follows: Cardiopulmonary bypass was accomplished using aortic and right atrial cannulation, nonpulsatile perfusion at 40 cc/kg/min, and a standard disposable bubble oxygenator with heat exchanger (Harvey 1000 — Wm. Harvey Company, Anaheim, California). All procedures were done under moderate systemic hypothermia (29°C) with cardiac arrest using hypothermia hyperkalemic (28 meq/L) cardioplegia (single bolus) and continuous delivery of topical saline at 4°C into the pericardial well. All distal coronary anastamoses were performed during cardioplegic cardiac arrest using 6-0 proline mono- filament suture. All proximal anastamoses were performed after the distal anastamoses were completed using 5-0 proline monofilament suture. Magnification ARIZONA MEDICINE 13 was optional and used at the surgeons' discretion. All coronary arteries were sized at surgery and an attempt to quantify flow (electromagnetic flow meter) was recorded. If an artery was found to be unsuitable by flow measurement or “stripping” it was categorized as an incomplete revascularization. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s test. Results There were 71 males and 14 females. Mean age range was 69.4 ± 3.4 years (65-80 years). Indications for Surgery The indications for surgery were unstable angina in 41 (48.2%), chronic stable angina in 37 (43.5%), previous myocardial infarction in six (7%) and preinfarction angina in one. Sixteen patients (19%) had left main coronary disease, 38 (45%) triple vessel disease, 27 (32%) double vessel disease and four (5%) had single vessel disease. The mean ejection fraction was 57.5% ± 16.5% (range 23%-84%). Intraoperative Measurements Intraoperative flow rates were performed in 77 of the 85 patients. Flow meter malfunction precluded this procedure in eight patients. Sixty-nine of 77 (89.6%) patients were felt to be satisfactorily revascularized while eight patients (10.4%), were felt to be incompletely revascularized. Inability to construct a bypass because of vessel inadequacy was the cause of incomplete revascularization in four patients while inadequate flow (< 20cc/min) was the cause in the other four. None of the incompletely revascularized patients had a perioperative myocardial infarction. The mean number of bypasses performed was 3.14 ± 0.86 which was 98% predicted by preoperative assessment. Mean ischemic time was 48.2 ± 16.4 min (range 13-80 min) and mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 91.5 ±31.1 min (range 28-243 min). Operative Complications There was one operative mortality (1.17%). Perioperative myocardial infarction documented by serial EKG's, myocardial enzymes or pyrophosphate scan occurred in six patients (7.1%). The sole mortality was included in this group as we presumed that he had had an intraoperative myocardial infarction. Twenty- two patients (25.8%) required ionotropic support in the early postoperative period. Two of these patients (10%) had perioperative infarctions without mortality. Four patients (4.7%) required intraaortic balloon support postoperatively (all were placed preoperatively), none sustained an infarction. Three patients (3.5%) were returned to surgery because of excess bleeding. No complications relating to reexploration were found. Postoperative Complications Complications were frequent and found in 81 patients (96%). They can be broadly categorized as: a) Respiratory: Respiratory complications occurred in 57 patients (67%). Thirty-nine patients had clinical and radiographic evidence of segmental, subsegmental or labor atelectasis. Fifteen patients developed pleural effusion, although none required thoracentesis or tubi drainage. Seven patients developed bacterial pneumonia, three of whom required prolongec intubation. One patient developed adult respirator' distress syndrome. All pulmonary complication resolved and added no significant postoperativ( hospitalization. b) Dysrhythmic: Postoperative rhythm disturbance i were present in 48 patients (57%). Atrial fibrillation wa the most common and occurred in 18 patients (21%) Premature ventricular contractions requiring druj therapy were present in 17 patients (20%). Othe. arrhythmias including supraventricular tachycardia severe sinus bradycardia and sinoatrial block occurrec in six patients (7.0%). Medical therapy was successful it, all but three patients who required electrica cardioversion. Miscellaneous Complications Six patients had nonpulmonary infectious com plications, three were urinary tract in origin, three wert respectively cellulitis at an IV site, at a balloon site anc incisional. Three episodes of acute tubular necrosis occurred None required dialysis and all resolved without residual Two patients had cerebrovascular accidents a surgery, and both recovered without residual. There was one episode of pseudomembranous coliti secondary to antibiotic therapy which cleared with cessation of the drugs. Follow-up Eighty-four patients (98.8%) were discharged from thn hospital. Follow-up was obtained on 80 (95%) of thn survivors for a mean of 26.6 + 10.9 months (range 9-4I-, mo). There were two late deaths; one five months after surgery from pneumonia and emphysema, and the other at nine months from supraventricular tachycardii and cardiogenic shock. Of the remaining 78 patients, 57. (73%) were free of angina while 21 (27%) hao postoperative angina. Of these, five had angina tha., required no medications. Sixteen had angina severr enough to require formal medical therapy. A highet percentage of the patients with postoperative anginr: had “incomplete revascularization” (14.8%) than thfi patients who were asymptomatic (8.77%), though thi' was not statistically significant. Two patients have hac late postoperative myocardial infarctions; one wa: incompletely revascularized. One patient was re admitted for repeat CABG after graft closure and returr of angina. He is now asymptomatic 14 months aftei surgery. Discussion Until now advanced age has been associated with ar increased operative mortality in CABG surgery. In ; recent multicenter study, “ men ages 60 to 69 had nearly three times the operative mortality of men ages 50 to 5f (3.5% vs 1.5%) The operative mortality in men over 7( years was 5.84% in that series.

Our experience ith one operative mortality in 85 patients reflects the ilidity of this concept. Our patients had more postoperative complications an those reported in other series. Respiratory )mplications were found most often in our patients hile dysrhythmias have been usually documented as ost common. This may be a result of our belief at atelectasis represents a complication and )ntributes to perioperative morbidity and mortality, espite the high incidence of respiratory complication, e low incidence of morbidity is the result of the )utine use of vigorous chest physiotherapy, !rosolized bronchodilators and incentive spirometry. ?rfusion time did not correlate with the presence of spiratory complications. Angiography revealed approximately 19% of patients )d left main coronary disease, 45% had three vessel sease, 32% had two vessel disease and only 5% had Tgle vessel disease. The incidence of left main )ronary disease in our series was comparable to that of her series®'^ while the incidence of single vessel sease was lower than the 10% to 30% incidence ported in other series. We conclude that our itient population is similar to that of other reports in )mparing severity of disease.

Our results confirm that CABG surgery in the elderly is safe, that the operative mortality is the same as that for younger candidates and that while postoperative complications are frequent they can be successfully managed by prompt and aggressive care. Furthermore, the excellent quality of life after surgery should warrant a reevaluation of age as a criteria for surgical exclusion. References 1.

Desser, M.D. The article by Mammana et al. indicates that coronary bypass surgery can be performed in the 65 to 80 year-old age group with a survival rate comparable with that in younger subjects. Clearly we must revise our definition of “elderly.” It is well recognized that as physicians age their lower limits for the designation “old” increases. Definitions aside, the standard problems relating to indications for surgery remain. Almost one-half of the study group underwent bypass surgery because of unstable angina pectoris. Prospective studies suggest that the mortality rate associated with this entity is similar for surgical and medical therapy. It should be noted that those undergoing operation have a significantly lower incidence of angina pectoris after hospital discharge. Subjects with left main coronary artery disease (19% in this study) are treated as a different group. Virtually every study performed on the subject demonstrates that bypass surgery in this group has a strong influence on survival, it is difficult to determine which patient with unstable angina pectoris will have this dangerous lesion and its relatively high prevalence in several investigative series is disturbing. Hence, the rational for coronary arteriography in the unstable angina group is provided. Mammana et al. are to be commended for their excellent results and inclusion of segmental atelectasis as a complication. Cardiologists are so familiar with this finding in postoperative cardiac surgery patients that they tend to consider this finding as a “non- complication.” Finally, it is unclear whether a perioperative myocardial infarction rate of 7% really represents a complication since it approximates the percentage of completed infarcts in hospitalized angina pectoris patients who are treated medically.

Positive reactors and family contacts Bceived diagnostic follow-up and treatment. (Table 1) As control of the disease in Maricopa County nproved, the number of new reported cases of jberculosis decreased. There was observed a gradual ecline of the positive reactor rate in the School Skin esting Program. The overall county rate of 0.47% in 967-1968 school year, dropped to 0.36% in 1973-1974 :hool year. (Tables 2 and 3.) Of particular interest was le sharp decline of the reactor rate from 1.1% in 1967- 968, to 0.0% in 1973-1974 in schools located in a one quare mile area of inner city, where the demonstration roject for comprehensive care for children and youth ^as implemented in 1968. In this area, routine jberculosis skin testing was conducted on all infants nd children receiving preventive care. This program of arly detection of the tuberculosis contact, with the rompt initiation of preventive chemotherapy, ighlights the value of continuing comprehensive ediatric care.^ However, there remained areas in the county where :hools show a consistently high rate of positive reactors jstifying the need for continuing skin testing in these istricts. Beginning in 1973-1974 school year, a selective rogram of skin testing was conducted in areas onsidered at high risk. Annually, schools were selected n the basis of previous positive reactor rates and the istribution of newly reported cases of tuberculosis in ie area. Testing was conducted on new enrollees ntering kindergarten, first grade and other grades. As programs of preventive child health care including jberculosis skin testing expanded in the county, there /as a decrease in the incidence of new reactors entering indergarten or first grade. However, the incidence of eactors among new school enterers in the older age roups did not decrease. A 1979 report mentioned tuberculosis was increasing [i Maricopa County and Arizona, while the national [icidence was decreasing.'* In Maricopa County the hcrease of new active cases was noted among those inder age 60 years, suggesting a change in tpidemiology, and a need to focus case finding among he young. (Table 4) The tuberculosis skin test conversion rate is known to ncrease rapidly after the age of ten years, and primary nfections occurring after age seven years are more ikely to be followed by chronic pulmonary uberculosis.^ It was felt that detection of the adolescent eactor, and institution of chemoprophylaxis can :hange the rising trend of tuberculosis in the county, hus, since 1978, in selected schools, all children in the eighth grade were routinely tested, in addition to testing )f new enterers in other grades. Results of skin testing programs during 1979-1980, 1980-1981 and 1981-1982 school years, confirmed the Table 1 Head Start Program Tuberculin Skin Test Reactors 1969-1981 Year Number Tested and Read Total Rate Maricopa County Program City of Phoenix Program 1969-1970 1,915 0.41% 0.4% 0.4% 1970-1971 1,832 0.3% 0.2% 0.4% 1971-1972 1,182 0.6% 1.2% 0.1% 1972-1973 1,273 0.6% 1.2% 0.0% 1973-1974 893 0.3% 0.0% 0.5% 1974-1975 870 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 1975-1976 962 0.6% 0.4% 0.6% 1976-1977 1,002 0.6% 0.7% 0.6% 1977-1978 1.020 1.8% 1.0% 2.1% 1978-1979 1,318 1.4%* 0.1% 1.6% 1979-1980 1,381 0.7% 0.0% 1.0% 1980-1981 1,347 0.9% 0.5% 1.1% * The national average rate for children of comparable age should be less than 0.2%.

In 1979-1980 school year the overall incidence in selected schools was 1.2%. In 1980- 1981 school year the overall incidence was 2.3%. In 1981- 1982 school year the overall incidence of positive reactors was 3.8% among the schools selected for testing. Such figures are excessively high for children of elementary school age. (Table 5) In the past ten years, there has been a change in the areas with high positive tuberculosis reactor rates. Prior to 1970, the high incidence of positive reactors was more likely to be found in the inner city and in the rural areas, where many children were from migrant farm labor families. With the advent of mechanization, and the decrease of migrant farm labor, positive reactors are not as prevalent in rural schools. However, in the crowded urban areas of the inner city, we continue to find the high percentage of positive reactors. These are the areas of concentration of poor with inadequate housing, inadequate nutrition and in need of health care. The experience in Maricopa County is similar to that of other urban communities which observe an apparent resurgence of tuberculosis in urban children.® All positive reactors and their families are referred for diagnostic evaluation and follow-up treatment. Such a program is cost effective, since preventive treatment is estimated at less than $15.00 per child, in contrast to at least $375.00-$800.00 per year for chemotherapy of adult tuberculosis. lnaddition,theadultwhoisunabletoearn a living must often fall upon community resources for family assistance. Summary Tuberculosis has been a major health problem in Arizona for many years. In Maricopa County, tuberculosis skin testing has been routinely conducted in public schools since prior to 1960. Testing was conducted on children first entering school (kindergarten or first grade). Routine skin testing was adopted in county health department preventive pediatric care programs in 1960, and extended to preschool and Headstart programs after 1965. As county tuberculosis control measures improved, the incidence of new cases decreased, and a decline in school reactor rates was observed. In 1973, a program of selective testing in high risk areas was implemented for cost efficiency. All new enrollees in all grades were tested. In 1978, selective testing was further modified to detect the adolescent convertor by routine screening of all children in eighth grade, in addition to new enrollees in all grades in selected schools. Postive reactors are now more often found among children in crowded urban areas. Results of the modified program justified the value of selective skin testing programs. The detection and preventive therapy of the adolescent convertor may change the rising trend of tuberculosis in the county. 18 Table 4 Bureau of Maternal and Child Health Maricopa County Department of Health Services Maricopa County TB Cases by Age — 1977-1978 1977 1978 Age # % # % 0-9 3 1.8 11 6.0 10-19 1 0.6 2 1.1 20-29 14 8.4 19 10.4 30-39 15 9.0 19 10.4 40-49 28 16.9 31 16.9 50-59 41 24.7 43 23.5 60+ 63 38.0 58 31.7 Unknown 1 0.6 0 0.0 Total 166 100.0 183 100.0 Table 5 Bureau of Maternal and Child Health Maricopa County Department of Health Services Selective TB Skin Testing in Elementary Schools Year Grades Number Tested Reactor Rate 1973-1974 New enterers All grades 10,488 0.74% 1974-1975 New enterers All grades 583 2.1% 1975-1976 New enterers All grades 328 3.4% 1976-1977 New enterers All grades 1,045 1.1% 1977-1978 New enterers All grades 814 1.0% 1978-1979 New enterers and All 8th grade 1,371 1.8% 1979-1980 New enterers and All 8th grade 3,747 1.2% 1980-1981 New enterers and All 8th grade 2,520 2.3% 1981-1982 New enterers and All 8th grade 1,354 3.8% References 1.

VELOSEF® CAPSULES Cephradine Capsules USP VELOSEF® TABLETS 1 GRAM Cephradine Tablets VELOSEF® FOR ORAL SUSPENSION Cephradine for Oral Suspension USP DESCRIPTION: Velosef ‘250' Capsules and Velosef ‘500’ Capsules (Cephradine Capsules USP) provide 250 mg and 500 mg cephradine, respectively, per capsule. Velosef Tablets (Cephradine Tablets) provide 1 g cephradine per tablet. Velosef 125' for Oral Suspension and Velosef 250' for Oral Suspension (Cephradine for Oral Suspension USP) after con- stitution provide 125 and 250 mg cephradine, respectively, per 5 ml teaspoonful. INDICATIONS AND USAGE: These preparations are indicated for the treatment of infections cau.sed by susceptible strains of designated microorganisms as follows: Respiratory Tract Infections (e.g., tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and lobar pneumonia) due to 5. pneumoniae (formerly D. pneumoniae) and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci [penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the pro- phylaxis of rheumatic fever; Velosef (Cephradine, Squibb) is generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; substantial data establishing the efficacy of Velosef in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present]; Otitis Media due to group A beta- hemolytic streptococci, H. influenzae, staphylococci, and S. pneumoniae: Skin and Skin Structures Infections due to staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci; Urinary Tract Infections, including prostatitis, due to F.. coli, P. mirahilis. Klebsiella species, and enterococci (S. faecalis). Note: Culture and susceptibility tests should be initiated prior to and during therapy. CONTRAINDICATIONS: In patients with known hypersen- sitivity to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics. WARNINGS; Use cephalosporin cierivatires ivitb f^reat caution in penicillin-sensilire patients since there is clinical and laboratory evidence of partial cross-allergenicity of the two groups of antibiotics; there are instances of reactions to both drug classes (including atiaphylaxis after parenteral use). In persons who have demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs, use antibiotics, including cephradine, cautiously and only when ab.solutely necessary. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the use of cephalosporins (and other broad spectrum antibiotics); therefore, it is important to consider its diagnosis in patients who develop diarrhea in associ- ation with antibiotic use. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of Clostridia. Studies indicate a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is one primary cause of antibiotic- a.ssociated colitis. Cholestyramine and colestipol resins have been shown to bind the toxin in vitro. Mild cases of colitis may respond to drug discontinuance alone. Manage moderate to severe ca.ses with fluid, electrolyte and protein supplemen- tation as indicated. Oral vancomycin is the treatment of choice for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C. difficile when the colitis is severe or is not relieved by drug discontinuance; consider other causes of colitis. PRECAUTIONS: General: Follow patients carefully to detect any side effects or unusual manifestations of drug idiosyncrasy. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discon- tinue the drug and treat the patient with the usual agents, e.g., pressor amines, antihistamines, or corticosteroids. Administer cephradine with caution in the presence of markedly impaired renal function. In patients with known or suspected renal impairment, make careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies prior to and during therapy as cephradine accumulates in the serum and tissues. See package insert for information on treatment of patients with impaired renal function. Prescribe cephradine with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Prolonged use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Take appropriate measures should superinfection occur during therapy. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Information for Patients: Caution diabetic patients that false results may occur with urine glucose tests (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions). Advise the patient to comply with the full course of therapy even if he begins to feel better and to take a missed dose as soon as po,ssible. Tell the patient he may take this medication with food or milk since G.I. upset may be a factor in compliance with the dosage regimen. The patient should report current use of any medicines and should be cautioned not to take other medications unless the physician knows and approves of their use (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Laboratory Tests: In patients with known or suspected renal impairment, it is advisable to monitor renal function. Drug Interactions: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with cephalosporins: Other antibacterial agents — Bacteriostats may interfere with the bactericidal action of cephalosporins in acute infec- tion; other agents, e.g., aminoglycosides, colistin, poly- myxins, vancomycin, may increase the possibility of nephrotoxicity. Diuretics (potent “loop diuretics,” e.g., furosemide and ethacrynic acid) — Enhanced possibility for renal toxicity. Probenecid — Increased and prolonged blood levels of cephalosporins, resulting in increased risk of nephrotoxicity. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: After treatment with cephradine, a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with Benedict’s solution, Eehling’s solution, or with Clinitest® tablets, but not with enzyme-based tests such as Clinistix® and Tes-Tape®. False -positive Coombs test results may occur in newborns whose mothers received a cephalosporin prior to delivery. Cephalosporins have been reported to cause false-positive reactions in tests for urinary proteins which use sulfosalicylic acid, false elevations of urinary 17-ketosteroid values, and prolonged prothrombin times. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or mutagenesis. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects/Impairment of Fertility — Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 4 times the maxi- mum indicated human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cephradine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, use this drug during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Since cephradine is excreted in breast milk during lactation, exercise caution when administering cephradine to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Adequate information is unavailable on the efficacy of b.i.d. regimens in children under nine months of age. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Untoward reactions are limited essentially to C.I. disturbances and, on occasion, to hyper- sensitivity phenomena. The latter are more likely to occur in persons who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity and those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria.

Brown, M.D. ditors; arry Hendin, M.D. imes L. Fry, M.D. awrence Z. Stern, M.D. Current management of serious head injuries often ivolves monitoring of intracranial pressure and surgical emoval of intracranial mass lesions. Utilizing these achniques, morbidity and mortality resulting from lajor head injury can be decreased. ntracranial Pressure Monitoring For a number of years neurosurgeons have been aterested in measuring intracranial pressure (ICP) in latients harboring intracranial pathology, including that iroduced by trauma. The first attempts at measuring ICP /ere made in 1922, but it was not until the early 1960’s aat the technique became systematically applied by undberg in Sweden.^ He monitored ICP with a entricular catheter connected to a transducer and hence to a standard pen and ink recorder. More ecently, with the advent of the electronic-computer ge, pressure is displayed continuously on an )scilloscope in association with digital readout. Data can )e recorded permanently on a strip chart recorder or emporarily in a data storage processor. Other echniques have been developed for measuring ICP, itilizing the epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid spaces or the location of the intracranial device. These devices rom: 345 East Virginia Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85004. Reprint bquest: Lewis J. Brown, M.D., 345 East Virginia Avenue, Phoenix, Irizona 85004. include a hollow tube transmitting pressure via a fluid- filled column to a remote physiologic transducer and an implantable unit which utilizes radiotelemetry. Additional options include a percutaneous pneumatic device with a fiberoptic sensor or an implanted transducer with percutaneous electrical leads. ^ All of these systems measure the level of intracranial pressure in millimeters of mercury. One torr is defined as one millimeter of mercury at sea level and is equivalent to 13.6 millimeters water pressure. Up to 15 torr is considered normal following head trauma. One might expect that the level of ICP is related to the patient’s clinical neurological state, i.e., the higher the pressure, the worse the patient. Unfortunately, this is occcasionally not the case after head trauma and a varying neurological deficit may be present without an elevated or changing intracranial pressure pattern. The latter situation usually results from intrinsic changes in the brain and/or brain stem as a result of the primary impact injury, in contrast to deficits produced by the compressive effects of an expanding mass. In the absence of space-taking masses, only about one-third of the patients, even those in coma, will have abnormal ICP, and the levelsareusually notmorethan moderately elevated.^'\"* Conversely, ICP is usually high in patients who have a space-occupying lesion, such asa hematoma or a swollen hemisphere.^ Lundberg identified three wave forms, the most clinically significant being the “A” or plateau wave. These are waves reaching a level of 50 to 100 torr and lasting five to twenty minutes. In the conscious patient, they are often accompanied by headache and signs of paroxysmal brain stem dysfunction. Lundberg felt these waves could lead to acute brain stem injury and, therefore, could be regarded as a harbinger of disaster. His observations were initially made on patients harboring intracranial neoplasms, but his theories and techniques were eventually extended to the acutely traumatized patient. Monitoring is very helpful in managing head injured patients undergoing medical therapy. The use of dehydrating agents and controlled ventilation is more efficaciously applied when the level of ICP is known. One is able to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatment by the response on the ICP, and it is surely mandatory in the treatment of patients on the barbiturate coma regimen. Finally, monitoring following operation can be very helpful in ascertaining satisfactory progress as a rising ICP curve may be the first indication of a developing postoperative complication. Clearly, one should not be led astray and rely on the intracranial pressure level for the total evaluation of the head injured patient. Monitoring represents only one aspect of the management program. Additionally, technical and artifactual problems may alter the reliability of the system. More important information is obtained from the detailed neurological examination, both initially and serially, and the level of consciousness 23 ARIZONA MEDICINE as defined by the Glasgow coma scale. In Phoenix, intracranial pressure monitoring is accomplished either by means of a ventricular catheter or with the Richmond bolt system.^ A Wilkinson cup catheter has been used postoperatively as well.® All three methods utilize hydrostatic means for transmitting pressure to an appropriate transducer. The ventricular catheter and the Richmond bold can be installed at the bedside, avoiding removal to the surgical suite, which is mandatory in the more complex systems. Although the information obtained from either system is comparable, one can drain cerebrospinal fluid via a ventricular catheter and reduce ICP directly, whereas this is patently impossible with any of the extraventricular devices. On the other hand, the Richmond bolt is somewhat easier to install, particularly when the ventricles are small and/or slit-like and are shifted. (Figure 1 and 2). Both systems carry minimal risk of infection if the period of use is limited to three days. Still, monitoring has been carried out for as long as three weeks without infection. Obviously, infection with a ventricular cannula has more ominous overtones than that which occurs with the extraventricular devices. With either system, patients are given prophylactic antibiotics until monitoring is discontinued. Intracranial Surgery Surgical therapy in craniocerebral trauma is clearly definable in many situations but less so in others. Surgical lesions are best classfied as extradural or intradural, the latter encompassing subdural and intracerebral locations. Frequently, a mixed picture occurs. The pure extradural hematoma is the most satisfying traumatic lesion to treat operatively, assuming the diagnosis has been made and treatment instituted before irreparable neurological deterioration has occurred. The classic description of this entity includes the so-called “lucid interval’’ which follows cranial trauma that usually, but not always, produces loss of consciousness. Soon thereafter awareness lessens, to be followed by stupor and then coma. Major alterations in vital signs occur with a rising blood pressure, slowed pulse and slowed, labored respirations. Transtentorial herniation and brain stem compression lead to pupillary inequality and/or paresis of eye movements with weakness of contralateral extremities. In reality, this “classical’’ description occurs in a small percentage of patients, usually in the 12 to 15 percent range. ^ There is no clear-cut neurological picture that will distinguish an acute extradural from an intradural hematoma. A high index of suspicion must be maintained in order to prevent an avoidable catas- trophe. Some patients are continuously unconscious from the moment of impact, whereas others may awaken and then become somnolent without other associated findings. Fortunately, the remarkable diagnostic accuracy of the computed tomographic scan and its increasing general availability now allow the 24 Figure 1 Hollow Richmond bolt, drill bit, and placement handle fo intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) Figure 2 Diagrammatic representation of proper placement of; Richmond bolt. (From D. P. Becker, et al.'^ Published with permission.) physician to make an earlier and more accurate diagnosis. (Figure 3). When injury occurs in an area where scanning is not ' available, early removal to a hospital that is equipped to handle such an injury is highly advisable. If, because of multiple injuries, the patient’s condition is too unstable to allow transfer, neurological function can often be temporarily maintained or improved by the use of hyperventilation and diuretic agents, furosemide and' JANUARY 1983 • XL • 1 Figure 3 r scan demonstrating typical appearance of large extradural ^matoma with ventricular shift. Figure 4 isic large craniotomy for trauma providing exposure and cess to areas most frequently involved in blunt trauma, rom D. P. Becker, et al.'\" Published with permission.) annitol. Dexamethasone in supramaximal doses is equently added to this treatment regimen despite the acertainty regarding its efficacy and mode of action in aniocerebral trauma.®'^ If neurological deterioration progresses, in the )sence of scanning capability, cerebral angiography m provide helpful diagnostic information. As a last !Sort, acute burr hole exploration may be necessary in atients who are suspected of harboring a surgical mass sion and who have not responded to the medical Jjuvants listed above. The specific situation will dictate hether this is best done in the emergency room or the perating room. Following stabilization, urgent transfer ) an appropriate institution should be arranged. Surgery itself depends to a considerable degree on the •cation of the mass and its size. Because of the naracteristic anatomy of the base of the skull, most itracranial hematomas are located in the frontal or Figure 5 Dural opening of the standard trauma craniotomy with presence of an acute subdural hematoma. Note the wide exposure this provides. (From D.P. Becker, et al. Ibid, Figure 4.) temporal regions. Therefore, a generous fronto- temporal curved scalp incision with an equally large bone flap will allow adequate evacuation of the lesion. (Figures 4 and 5). Often pulped or contused brain parenchyma is present in association with the clot and is removed at the same time. As mentioned earlier, surgical removal of extradural hematomas usually carries an excellent prognosis. The prognosis with intradural lesions is less favorable, but it is becoming increasingly clear that early and extensive evacuation of these lesions can improve the outlook. The survival rate and the quality of survival may be as much a function of the degree of the primary impact injury as it is to the secondary compressive effects of the mass lesion. Posterior fossa hematomas are quite uncommon, comprising only two to three percent of all traumatic hematomas. The diagnosis has been quite difficult to make in the past, prior to the advent of computed scanning. With this remarkable innovation, it is now possible to make the diagnosis in most instances. Surgical evacuation of these lesions requires the performance of a posterior fossa craniectomy. Open or compounded wounds of the skull and brain obviously require early debridement of all layers with removal of devitalized brain followed by voluminous irrigation of the traumatized areas with saline and antibiotic solutions. Dural closure, either primarily or with the use of a pericranial or fascial graft, should be considered mandatory. Postoperative care should include high doses of antibiotics. Patients who have a major shift of midline structures and no hematoma (or a minimal one) represent a major therapeutic challenge. They are the most precarious patients in the closed head trauma group. Intensive medical management and monitoring must be started expeditiously. This may include deep barbiturate coma. This technique has come under recent criticism. Its future inclusion in the therapeutic armamentarium in 25 ARIZONA MEDICINE trauma remains somewhat unclear at this time.” Infrequently, hemicraniectomy with removal of a massive bone flap and incision of the dural membrane has been utilized to control inexorably increasing intracranial pressure as a “salvage\" procedure. The results of this aggressive procedure are varied, but quality survival is occasionally achieved in the face of what appear to be a hopeless situation. References 1.

The addition of cyclo- hosphamide and vincristine to doxorubicin and DTIC icreased the overall response rate to 50% and 17% of le patients had a complete response. The median jrvival in this SWOG study was 16 months.® Not all udies of CYVADIC, however, have duplicated this egree of success. Using the same dose and schedule as le SWOG study, a European group had a 24% response ite® and UCLA achieved a response rate of only 15%.^ hese combinations have never been compared to oxorubicin alone in a randomized fashion, and it is not Bt known which, if any, of the drugs should be used in ambination. Adding other active agents such as :tinomycin D, low-dose methotrexate, and methyl CNU has not been successful. In an attempt to improve the results, the M. D. nderson Hospital used a protective environment and rophylactic antibiotics and escalated the standard YVADIC doses. Of 15 patients treated in this fashion, 4% had a response. There were 27% complete Bsponders, with a median survival of 22 months.® Adjuvant treatment for soft tissue sarcomas is just eginning. Preliminary results in two different protocols ppear promising in reducing relapses. Regimens sed have included COMPADRI (cyclophosphamide, incristine, phenylalanine mustard, and adriamycin) and lLOMAD (vincristine, high-dose methotrexate, driamycin, DTIC, chlorambucil, and actinomycin D). )steogenic Sarcomas High -dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue has ieen reported to produce the highest single-agent esponse rate in osteogenic sarcoma. Memorial Sloan- [ettering Cancer Center in New York reported an 86% ^sponse rate with weekly doses of 8 to 12 gm/m^.“ This jegree of success appears dependent upon following a igorous schedule with careful monitoring of serum nethotrexate levels, urine volume, urine pH, and eucovorin rescue doses. It is this attention to detail vhich the New York investigators feel separates their successful studies from others which have not shown a high response rate despite significant toxicity.^® For example, the Mayo Clinic had only one responder in 16 patients treated with their high-dose methotrexate regimen. Thus, because of its high cost, toxicity, and questionable efficacy, high-dose methotrexate is not widely available. Other approaches include using doxorubicin aloneor the CYVADIC regimen. Both have a 22% response rate in advanced disease.^® A 60% response rate was obtained in 13 patients treated with the combination of bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin (BCD).^® Limb Salvage and Adjuvant Therapy in Osteogenic Sarcoma With the demonstration of activity with chemo- therapeutic agents, attempts to save limbs and decrease the postsurgical relapse rate were begun. Adjuvant studies were based on the premise that the disease-free survival after excision of the primary tumor was only 20%, and most relapses occurred in the lungs within the first two years. This implied metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. When the initial report of adjuvant high- dose methotrexate claimed an 80% 2-year disease survival,^’ adjuvant therapy became a common practice. This has become an area of controversy. The Mayo Clinic has demonstrated a disease-free survival rate of 40% to 50% in their surgery only series.'®'^® This is presumed to be a consequence of better staging (i.e., chest computed tomography scanning) and improved surgical tech- niques. The initial study of adjuvant therapy has had a decline from 80% disease-free patients at two years to 43% at five years.^° Combination chemotherapy in an adjuvant setting, using many different regimens, has produced disease-free survival ratesfrom 50%to90%.^ A controlled trial is now under way using the optimum chemotherapy regimen as defined by Memorial Sloan- Kettering compared to a surgery alone arm. The chemotherapy consists of preoperative high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, and the bleomycin, cycio ph osphamide, dactinomycin combination. Platinum is added to the same five drugs postoperatively if less than 90% tumor necrosis was achieved with the preoperative chemotherapy. Limb salvage approaches have consisted of the use of either systemic chemotherapy preoperatively (the above Memorial Sloan-Kettering protocol) or intra- arterial therapy directly into the tumor bed with Adriamycin followed by radiation therapy and the limb salvage surgery. Both approaches have demonstrated initial success. Studies at the University of Arizona Platinum is a relatively new chemotherapeutic agent with demonstrated activity in sarcoma^® including tumors resistant to Adriamycin^\"’ and high-dose methotrexate.^® Direct infusion of tumors with platinum alone has resulted in response rates of over 50%.®® A combination of Adriamycin and platinum has been used for the past decade in other solid tumors,®’ and has ARIZONA MEDICINE 27 already demonstrated effectiveness when used in the adjuvant setting for osteogenic sarcomas. Additive and, in some cases, synergistic effects have been seen in vitro. Both drugs can be given at maximum doses as their toxicities do not significantly overlap. This combination is now in use at the University of Arizona to determine its response rate and response duration. The regimen will be used for advanced disease, in the adjuvant setting, and in preoperative infusions. Preoperative infusions are given as part of a multidisciplinary team approach to limb salvage therapy. Patients are seen and evaluated by the radiology, orthopedic surgery, radiation oncology, and hematology/oncology departments. After appropriate diagnostic and staging procedures, an arteriogram is obtained with placement of an indwelling catheter in the tumor’s blood supply. Adriamycin is then infused over 72 hours, interrupted three times for bolus platinum infusions. Immediately following chemo- therapy, radiation therapy consisting of 3,500 rads over two weeks is given. One week after radiation, limb salvage surgery utilizing artificial prostheses or autologous bone grafts is performed. Postoperatively an additional five courses of Adriamycin plus platinum chemotherapy is given as adjuvant therapy. In summary, chemotherapy for both soft tissue and bone sarcomas needs to be improved. In metastatic disease, complete responses are rare and patients with partial responses have a duration of survival of less than two years. The optimum drugs and dosages to be used in preoperative therapy remain to be defined. Most adjuvant studies have a 40% or greater relapse rate. Future approaches to the chemotherapy of soft tissue sarcomas should emphasize the development of new agents with greater therapeutic efficacy than doxorubicin. For bone sarcomas, the role of high-dose methotrexate needs to be varified and the debate of adjuvant chemotherapy resolved. References 1. Rosenberg SA, Suit HD.

The adaptational value of a ghtly knit family network conforms nicely to the emands of an agrarian society; it fits less well in an idustrialized urban society where values seem to Tange as rapidly as technology.^ Sixty-five percent of all omes and apartments are occupied by other than a vo-parent family, and single-parent families are rowing at 19 times the rate of dual-parent families.^ amilies, indeed, are isolated from the mainstream of jcial institutions and the traditional nuclear family may ecome an anachronism. om; Arizona Health Plan, Inc., 4811 North Seventh Street, Phoenix, rizona 85014.

Compared to nonphysician professionals who suffer dissatisfaction rates of 32 percent; physicians and their families had a 50 percent higher rate of marital distress.^ The most vulnerable physicians in Vaillant’s study are more likely than their controls to show traits of dependency, pessimism, passivity and self-doubt. On the other hand. Rose and Rosow”* point out the divorce rate among the general population in California is 41 percent higher than it is among age-matched physicians. Furthermore, complaint rates from professionals in California indicated that physiciansstood nextto natural scientists as the most stable of married professionals, with divorce complaint rates of 16.4 per thousand per year. The average among all professionals was 18.3 per thousand and that of the total population was 22.6 per thousand. McCue^ offers an incisive review of the special stresses of medical practice. All of these will influence the physician’s family life. They include: 1. Coping with the burden of suffering. In the author’s words, \"Medicine is selected as a profession by students who expect to be rewarded by satisfying encounters with their patients, yet their chosen career consists of routinely interacting with persons who are anxious, uncomfortable, and often unable to express gratitude or affection.’’ Many patients come in pain, requesting relief, and often the physician may greet the pain with suspicion rather than compassion. Fear of manipulation by patients with drug acquisitive behavior is especially common among residents and nurses who tolerate the complaints more willingly than the disapproval of their peers. Furthermore, the physician is not only entrusted with the relief of pain but also the decisions to inflict pain, to proscribe pleasures, or to deny that palliative treatment of discomfort. 2. Fear. Most patients come in fear and fear con- taminates the health professions. FHealth professionals erect high barriers against recognition of fear within themselves. One only needs to observe the health professional at work in a coronary care unit to be impressed with how adept the human species is in constructing masks of equanimity. 3. Sexuality and seduction. Physicians are privileged to probe into areas of the body that are hidden from all others and into private aspects of patients’ lives that are disguised with psychological defenses and denial. Familiarity, in this instance, often breeds attempt. Family practitioners, obstetricians, and internists are most vulnerable' to sexual seduction. One survey® disclosed ARIZONA MEDICINE 29 that at least five percent of physicians have had sexual intercourse with their patients. 4. Death. Many physicians enter the profession to defeat death. All of us are disappointed. Aggravating the problem in the late Twentieth Century is the availability of a number of technological innovations which permit physicians greater power in prolonging life and possibly prolonging suffering. 5. Uncertainty. While society conveys on the doctor an almost godlike power, the physician — at least the sophisticated physicians — is acutely aware of the limitations of his capacity. Nonetheless, patients look to the doctor for predictability and certainty. In behalf of his patients, the physician erects a facade of omniscience which often contaminates the role shift between professionalism and intimacy. Adding to these burdens are the special problems of envy of one’s neighbors, guilt associated with financial success, and the experience of being in a fishbowl scrutinized by others for any evidence of weakness. Studies on physician impairment indicate that the seeds of impairment can be discovered in careful histories of the impaired physician’s childhood. A study of drug- dependent physicians indicated that of the 30 physicians in the study, only four spoke favorably of their mothers and one spoke favorably of his father. The father was perceived typically as passive, withdrawn and indifferent.' Although capable of offering care to patients, the depression-prone and drug-abused-prone physician seems distant, often passive and isolated according to family members. The demands for intimacy can be particularly difficult at times when the physician has little attention or energy left over from an exhausting practice. But, the impaired physician is just the tip of the iceberg. As Vaillant’s survey indicates, approximately half of us cope with our self-esteem problems by struggling for perfectionism, certainty, and correctness. The opportunity for power and financial success available within the walls of the hospital or office seem too tempting when compared with the uncertain opportunities provided within family life. Add to this the discrepancy between our skills as medical technicians and our skills in human interaction and you have a formula for vocational success but emotional distress in the family. At a recent conference on stress management for physicians, I informally surveyed 22 physicians asking two questions; Is the physician family different? And, if so, what contributes to those differences? The lack of rigor of the survey and the nature of the setting, obviously undermines the reliability of the data. Nonetheless, 18 of the physicians interviewed (all male) perceived a sharp discrepancy between their family life and that of their nonphysician friends. This was subsequently endorsed by interviews with ten of twelve physician job applicants in a large health maintenance organization. 30 Among the stresses identified most frequently wer the following: 1. The work of being a physician issocompellingast leave little energy available for the demands of intimac and suppport in the family. 2. Patients are so demanding and covertly or openi hostile as to induce a hostile state in the physician. 3. Physicians are ill-trained in coping with probler patients: the dingers, demanders, help-rejectors, an denyers. They often feel helpless. The helplessness soo yields anger and the family is frequently the displace target of the anger. 4. The physician’s schedule is unpredictable. Or physician remarked how his wife flew into a rage whe he was paged after the family had just embarked on family picnic which had been planned for two week^ 5. Many physicians conveyed an inability to disclos the specifics of their burdens to their spouses. This w. particularly true in psychiatry where the demands ( confidentiality prevented a detailed rendering of th patient-related stresses that the physician h; experienced. 6. Most physicians acknowledged that they carried I burden of hostility around with them. The healthiq among the survey respondents had set aside speci ' times wherein they could drift off while alone, sheltere from the demands of any other person. How can the physician cope with the challenges an stresses that his profession and social role places upo his family? I offer below several suggestions that havri worked in my clinical practice: j First, become aware of one’s strengths and liabilities ai a family member. Review with the family the specificsci how being a physician’s family may affect each membe By sharing an understanding of the problems, on mitigates against resentment and guilt. . Second, become students in learning how to livu Appreciate that, as physicians, we are like dinosaunj overly specialized in one area of development, but quit] undeveloped in other areas. This is a byproduct of ou! very technically-oriented educational system. We ardj however, good students and should employ ou learning skills in behalf of developing skills in intimao and in play. Take courses together; participate in family enrichment program; set aside time for learnin about other aspects of life beyond medicine. Third, schedule high-priority time for family activitie Arrange on-call responsibilities so that they do nc intrude on critical family events. Fourth, develop a long-range family plan with you spouse. Explore ways to bring to your day-to-da existence activities that have relevance to these long range plans. Thus, the plan should not be merely drearr but rather an outline for a program for living. Critical in all of the above is time for being, time fc pleasure and opportunities for good humor. The fir' step in learning about ourselves should be taken wit humility. .■ JANUARY 1983 • XL • 1 References Zwerling I: Struggle for survival : A psychiatrist’s perspective on the contemporary family.
