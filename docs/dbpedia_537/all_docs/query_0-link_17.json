        "text": "The research presented herein encompassed analysis of prehistoric graves from the necropolis of the Velika Mrdakovica Hillfort in the vicinity of Zaton, near Šibenik. These are five graves from the earliest period of burials, from the Early Iron Age. Their analysis and synthesis will serve as the point of departure for fuller insight into the long, rich and fluctuating history experienced by its inhabitants and inheritors. Based on the types of burials, the graves generally comply with rites typical of the Šibenik region and the central Adriatic coastal belt. However, the placement of the bodies fully extended deviated from the overriding practices in this core territory of the Liburnians. Most of the gathered physical cultural materials consist of personal attire items and jewellery of the deceased, which have been ascribed to the Liburnian culture in the broader sense of typological classification. In line with their previous cultural interpretation, they have been separated into men’s and women’s attire, wherein the finds of pins and fibulae, as well as ring-shaped jewellery and amber beads, are the most prominent. From the chronological standpoint, two general burial periods have been distinguished in their interpretation. Typical of the older graves is the large fibula with amber bead on the bow, while the younger graves are characterized by the predominance of the proto-Certosa fibula with a small globule at the end of the foot. Despite double or multiple interments, the materials indicate a certain chronological framework, which suggests simultaneous or very brief subsequent interments, interpreted in the sense of narrower familial graves. Synchronized with the Liburnian culture periodization, interments in the older graves proceeded in the II. A and B phases, while the younger ones proceeded from the end of cultural phase III and in phase IV according to the classical periodization scheme. In compliance with the typological-chronological analysis of the materials in comparison to coterminous phenomena in the Adriatic basin cultures, a revised relative and higher absolute chronological scheme for the Liburnian sphere are proposed in the synthesis.\n\nThe article discusses three La Tène cremation graves discovered in Sládkovičovo (SW Slovakia) during the construction of a new access road to family houses in the site Pri železnici/Malý Diosek. Burnt human remains were placed together with grave inventory in one or two concentrations in northern parts in grave pits. Human remains were in one of the graves (grave 1) in a vessel. Rich equipment in graves 2 and 3 consisting especially of parts of costume points to adult woman burials. The graves can be based on grave inventory and radiocarbon dating from animal bones to the Middle La Tène – LT C1 stage (LT C1a phase). The article presents the basic processing of anthropological material, the grave inventory included archaeozoological analysis of animal bones. Very important is analysis of the burial rite of graves."
