With so many changes occurring day by day, taking a few minutes to form a mew perspective became a regular necessity. It was only when we took a second glance that every- thing came together and took on A New Look. This New Look could have been some- thing as simple as the summer's foliage turning to yellow and red hues at the first frost. Events abroad carried a sense of change pertinent to our own views as well. Everyday, walls crumbled, countries were born and allegiances were made and broken. A New Look was evident in every as- pect of campus life. No longer was JMU one of Virginia's best kept secrets. Over and over again, the university was named as one of the top ten buys in education by LIS News & World Report and Money Week. Undoubtedly, credit was due to both faculty and students for striving to- ward the academic excellence that person- ified JMU. As part of the college commu- nity, we were fulfilling our goals of striving for the best and looking forward . . .

For many, it was the first semester that bulldozers did not welcome us back. Though the machin- ery of the past was sometimes an inconve- nience, the results were noticeable and welcomed. With the addition of new aca- demic buildings in recent years, expansion was the word. Students and faculty witnessed the con- struction of the newest addition to the Quad, the Music Building, and more re- cently, Sonner Hall and Zane D. Showker Hall. As the renovations to Burruss Hall, home to the Biology Department, were re- alized, the Biology Village was gratefully vacated. Everything seemed to be on the move as Mr. Chips relocated into the old police station and the Public Safety office found a new home in Shenandoah Hall. The hum of construction was not missing for long as change began once again with improvements to the Warren Campus Center. Russell Stuart dances on the Commons during midday performance. Students found this area of campus to be not only a meeting place, but also a place for fun. lins? * Opening; 5 New Changes As the grounds began to take on a new look, so did the surrounding community. Off-campus living became more popular as options expanded. Port Republic Road, commonly known as \"the hill,\" was home to four apartment complexes-Hunter's Ridge, Squire Hill, Ashby Crossing, and the Commons-which housed close to two thousand of the six thousand off-campus students. Other options included Universi- ty Place, Duke Gardens, College Station, and Madison Manor, to name a few. Aside from growth in student housing, vacant lots began to fill with new restau- rants and shops. Although Spanky's and Luigi's were still the favorites of many, new spots such as Clayborne's, The Bel- zona Cafe and Mr. J's grew more popular. Another sign of growth in the communi- ty was the construction of the new city jail. Located near Court Square downtown, the new jail forced several private businesses to relocate or close down, an unfortunate consequence of the explosion of growth in the city. - \\^ v i ^y^ ■ ~L\\ («* I oOpening A soldier gives the peace sign in the Na- tional Victory Parade in Washington, DC.

College was perhaps the one place where people from every back- ground imaginable came together and met on common ground. Whether it was as part of an organization or a protest or through a class project or a job, students and faculty came together,* supporting each other in whatever the goal. There was an array of activities for stu- dents, ranging from academic clubs to in- tramural athletics to Greek organizations. Whatever their interests, students could find their own niche. Environmentally aware students formed E.A.R.T.H.-Envi- ronmental Awareness and Restoration Through our Help. Other students found their niche in organizations such as the College Republicans, Amnesty Interna- tional, or one of the many religious organizations. Rutledge Terminclla V New Changes Although students joined together for important issues and fun, the individuality of each person remained evident. Whether it was through clothing, actions, words, or even music, students expressed them- selves, their opinions and their values free- ly. Stereotypes seemed to be shadows of the past as college students became less concerned with labels and trends. With each individual came a growing sense of admiration for those who were unlike themselves. As we matured in all aspects of the word, we appreciated the diversity of col- lege life. Such variety encouraged us to examine ourselves. Our minds were opened by those whose ideas and actions were different from our own. Experiences with others translated into personal growth, both intellectually and emotionally. We were immersed into an atmosphere where varying attitudes af- fected us. The freedom to be our unique selves was perhaps the most valuable experience. The flower beds by Hillcrest House color the grounds. Beds such as these remind the campus community of the beauty of nature. Rutlcdge The breezeways of Johnston Hall, home to the psychology department, offer a nice break from dull office walls.

We still had fun the old-fashioned way. Reddish Knob remained the favorite spot to watch the magnificent tints of sunset. And we still splashed in the icy waters of Blue Hole, Green Hole, Union Springs and Switzer Dam to relieve the heat. Greek organizations showed off their talents in competitive events such as Greek Sing in the spring and the Home- coming Block Show in the fall. The Com- mons was also a great place for talented students to get campus- wide exposure. Bands like Uncle Charlie, Johnnie's Heri- tage, Full Stop, After Five and Everything drew large crowds there. The JMU tradition was alive and well as athletic events experienced a rebirth of spirit. The football and women's soccer teams were nationally ranked, and the men's basketball team rose to play oppo- nents such as UNLV, Georgia Tech and Brigham Young University. The university grew as a whole while we all grew as individuals. College was a time to gain perspective while still focusing on our developing goals. .«; ■\"*•* ' ' - ■WR-* As the setting sun peaks through the limbs of a weeping willow, a couple watches the rays reflect off Newman Lake.

This year brought the return of the new and improved Burruss Hall, the acquisition of a much-needed business center, the influx of aspiring freshmen, the ever- increasing parking dilemma and the promise of more construction. The abundant variation of lifestyles and interests in and around campus provided innumerable avenues for student in- volvement and self-expression. Through the decisions we made during college, we molded who we were and what we would become in the future. We learned to appreciate the varying viewpoints of those around us. Influences such as friends, clubs, greek organizations, living arrangements and occupations helped establish our priorities and thus created our attitudes. Look The campus and the individual shared the same characteris- tics of honoring tradition as well as welcoming the trends of the future. We absorbed the changing times, placed each aspect in its proper perspective and took a new look at life. ■ ■ Raquel Kelly and Rhonda Wilson hang out on the Commons and listen to the af- ternoon's entertainment provided by the University Program Board.

An abundance of speeches, awards and announcements placed a demand on the attention spans of many students. \\ senior, late for the procession, walks by himself to the trains of \"Pomp and Circumstance.\" The entire senior lass walked across the field to their seats while friends nd family looked on. Oh the places we'll go It's Reality As the school year came to a close, for some it was the end of an era. The days of classes and nights of parties were over. It was time not to break for the summer sea- son, but to venture into the real world. It was a time to graduate. For some it was a joyful progression into the job market while others feared the un- known. As senior David Hylton put it, \"I'm excited about graduating, but I'd feel much better if 1 knew what I was going to do after today!\" Due to the slump in the economy, many seniors found themselves still searching for any type of employment related to their field of study. Seniors faced another dilemma as well, leaving friends behind. Friendships that were fostered over four or more years be- came treasured as the graduates realized that they would never see many of the familiar faces again. Although a vast ma- jority of seniors believed they would stay in touch with a close circle of friends, the acquaintances and other ties that flour- ished at school were in jeopardy of being lost. Steve Brown lifts his head to glance over the caps of his fellow graduates. Adorned in caps, gowns, purple and gold, the graduates represented the epitome of the school. \"I know I'll keep in contact with my best friends, but I hate to lose all the other friendships I've made. It's like losing a part of yourself and I'm really going to miss it, \" commented graduate Nancy Tipton. The Final ceremony dedicated to the graduates transpired on May 4, 1991, at Bridgeforth Stadium. The weather was picture perfect, as compared to previous years of rain and snow. The speaker was Elizabeth Lacy, a justice on the Virginia Supreme Court. Also, for the first time, due to petitions by the SGA, a student speaker, Steven Nickel, was chosen by a selection commit- tee to address the class of 1 99 1 . His speech discussed the challenges and choices that the seiors faced entering into society. The ceremony captured the jubilation of the occasion, and it was filled with beach balls, balloons, and hundreds of snapping cameras. Parents anxiously scanned the graduates to try and pick out their child. \"I sat with the parents of a friend, and his mom held a bunch of red helium balloons so that he would know where his family was during the ceremony. We were able to keep track of him by the big \"R\" he had masking taped to his hat.\" said Frandee Heaton. For some, the pursuit of higher educa- tion does not mean just going to college. While attending a university may satisfy the goals of many, others graduate still searching for their purpose in life. Gradu- ation, a day of joy and sorrow, marked both an ending and a beautiful beginning. Kate Travers Lauren Kerr flashes a grin of accomplishment after receiving her diploma during the commencement ceremony Graduation was a momentous occasion, finalizing many long years of work. Graduation 17 Quotables The Hill outside of D-Hall is a prime spot for hang- ing out and watching performers and patio bands. Two ASA sisters share a laugh at JM's. Students partied with friends frequently at J M's because of the pub's popularity. \"It doesn't mat- ter where you hang out in the 'Burg, as long as you're with friends, you're sure to have fun. \" Susan Clevenger Showing off their basketball skills, students spend a relaxing evening at JM's The bar and deli met the needs of those wanting to eat, drink, dance or watch television. 18 Hangouts » ; JVy Hangin' Out Where wild things are m- Hangin' out. This phrase ranked high on the campus vocabulary list. It described anything from watching T.V. alone, to partying around a keg, to dancing at Play- er's. After exploring what the 'Burg had to offer, most students found their niche — their favorite place to hang out. Campus hang-outs were easy to spot at any time of day. The quad, the commons, the hill, the campus center, D-Hall, and even the library overflowed with students enjoying a little free time. \"The union is the perfect spot to hang out. It's pretty much in the center of things so you can always go in and find someone you know,\" said sophomore Carla Foster. Greek Row, a.k.a. \"the row\", was an- other popular place to hang out. Members of fraternities and sororities sometimes found it to be a home away from home - or from the dorm during the day, but at night it was often open for anyone on the lists. \"The frat house is a great place to go and sit around because you know every- one, and it's real casual and comfortable. At night it's even better when the parties kick in,\" said sophomore Robert Golden. Stepping across campus boundaries opened a more diverse set of possibilities. Clubs, bars, and restaurants fulfilled stu- dents' needs to eat, drink and be merry. Players was a favorite place to go out dancing, and its style of music changed evening by evening to fit the tastes of everyone. \"Friday nights at Player's are always wild — it's a great place to go dance and mingle and meet people. It's cool because you don't have to drink in order to have a good time,\" said junior Kevin Wilson. J.M.'s was another hot spot to dance, drink and eat. Complete with a bar and deli it satisfied everyone. The most popu- lar times at J.M.'s were Tuesday night ladies night and Friday afternoon happy hour. \"J.M.'s is a pretty cool place to go hang out and drink. I like the atmosphere. It's not too crowded, but it's not quiet either. I usually go there before I go out for the evening,\" said senior William Coles. Other restaurants such as Pargo's, Va- lentino's. Tully's, Luigi's, and Spanky's appealed to the masses depending on their taste in food or music or the day of the week. Sheila Barnharl Kelly Long and Judy Satterfield converse over drinks and enjoy each others company in the com- fortable atmosphere of T.G. Armadillo's. T.G.'s was a frequent gathering place for students. Conveniently located at the center of campus, the Pedestrian Plaza behind Keezell Hall is constantly filled with students relaxing, studying, meeting friends, or passing through on their way to class. Hangouts 19 Btthardson Let the games begin! fc- Greek Week Close your eyes for a minute, and go back in time to that special place, when a sunny afternoon meant a good old-fash- ioned party, and the festive surroundings could make all your worries vanish. You might have participated in a 3-legged race, watched an eat-off, checked out a boating competition or played some other crazy games. If you were the shy type, maybe the excitement came from just soaking up the atmosphere, and hanging out with your peers. For many, this excitement was expe- rienced more than a decade ago, for oth- ers, however, it was Greek Week '91! Greek Week brought out the kid in each of us. \"Greek Week was cool because ev- erybody runs around like an idiot, and has fun doing it!\" said Benj Farmory. Where else would rival sorority sisters and frater- nity brothers try vigorously to cross the finish line first, while holding a spoon that was balancing an egg? Other field games included the famous 3-legged race, relay runs, sack jumps, the wheelbarrel, and the list continues. For those who wanted to test their strength, the keg toss got the adrenalin flowing. Not only did the greek men participate in this event, but the wom- en made the kegs soar as well! Conquering Newman Lake in the death-defying boat race proved to be a wet-and-wild free for all, as many brothers jumped ship in an effort to sink opposing forces! The week provided entertainment for those students not affiliated with the greek system as well. The lake area was packed with students enjoying the springtime sun- shine and watching the various events tak- 20 Greek Week ing place both on and off shore. For those who weren't lovers of the great outdoors, other opportunities for socializing were available, the most infamous being Greek Sing and the Progressive Happy Hour. Greek Sing offered the chance for each of the greek organizations to show off their musical talents. Held in Wilson Hall, the shows ranged from fast-paced dance rou- tines, to beauty pageants, to broadway re- views. The Progressive Happy Hour was titled not for the type of music played, but because it started at the top of the row and ended at the bottom, each fraternity in between sponsoring the music and refresh- ments. Like the large group of listeners, the music was different, adding to the great variety Greek Week had to offer. Although at first it appeared that this program was taking its toll on the environ- ment through raft debris, rubbage, or rem- nants of the refreshments, a final row- clean-up event gave sororities and frater- nities a chance to band together once more to give the row a well-deserved cleaning. This event, as with all the festivities, gave greeks the chance to make new friend- ships, strengthen existing ones, and take pride not in individual organizations, but in just being greek. As Traci Duncan sum- marized, \"It was a great time. It was great to see all the organizations pulling togeth- er and enjoying themselves regardless of affiliation.\" Byron Kavanaugh Contestants line up for the wheelbarrel races. The sororities reached for the sand as the fraternities wheeled them away. In preparation for the float race, the sisters of AST attach their trademark, the turtle, to the kegs used to keep them afloat. They hoped the turtle wasn't representative of how they would move in the race. The costumes worn by the brothers of Kappa Sigma changes of the school through the years.

Greek Week 21 Waste Not The city of Harrisonburg helps better our environment by pro- viding bins to hold paper, glass or aluminum to be recycled. These bins made it easier for students to participate in the movement. Reduce, reuse, and recycle; to many these words meant more than tossing an empty Coke can into a recycling bin. Con- cerns for environmental protection and preservation were addressed throughout the year, on a day-to-day basis. From Earth group meetings, open to all students, to various methods used to encourage peo- ple to recycle, the importance of environ- mental protection was evident on and off campus. \"My roommate and I understand the importance of helping to preserve the envi- ronment. We don't use aerosol cans any- more and we recycle whatever we can,\" said Christina Sharkley. In a campus-wide effort to reduce, re- use, and recycle, the university implement- ed a series of programs to increase the active participation of the student body in the Earth movement. Recylcing bins for paper, glass, and aluminum, were placed conveniently near the entrance of most dorms, encouraging students to take part in Earth awareness. New to campus were the white receptacles placed next to most trash bins for aluminum can recycling. In addition, JMU Food Services distributed reusable \"R-mugs\" free of charge. Earth mugs could be purchased for three dollars. These mugs were made available in an effort to reduce the disposal of styrofoam and paper cups at D-Hall and PC Dukes. \"Recycling and eliminating unnecessary waste are both practical and effective methods of caring for the environment. I was glad to see the many groups and orga- nizations on campus that were dedicated to preserving the Earth. I think their ef- forts and dedication made others aware of Corey Maclntire proudly displays a smile and his F.arth Mug. More than a fad, the mugs represented an awareness of the environment. the importance of environmental issues,\" said Lori Kells. This worthy and justifiable interest was initiated on April 22, 1970, the dated cele- bration of Earth Day. The preservation of the Earth began for the benefit and pros- perity of future generations. Fortunately, students realized the significance of this cause and took action to help make a dif- ference. Their efforts did not go unnoticed and many felt satisfied that their contribu- tions would be appreciated and recogniz- able in years to come. Sarah Francavilla 22 Earth Awareness Everyone got into environmental awareness as D- Hall provided the new reusable mugs which could be used inside D-Hall, saving a countless number of paper cups.

The word conjures images of ;un, sand and sea. For most college stu- ients, the word meant vacation. Finally, ,ve had a momentary lapse from the relent- ess onslaught of scantron forms, exams, roup meetings, papers, snooze-provoking Masses, and stress attacks. That \"lapse\", is it would seem in September, was a wel- ome break and a well deserved reward. \\nticipation reached its peak as beach 3lans and job hunts loomed ahead. Follow- ng the exhaustion of finals week, even working seemed more appealing than chool! Unfortunately, not everyone was able to take that necessary vacation all summer ong. JMU's campus was not quite desert- d after graduation. May session was a sopular way to pick up three credits and n A, while enjoying the social scene of a three-week party. Summer Session immediately followed. Juniors Alice Riddick and Diane Albright were two of the summer residents of Harrisonburg. Riddick stayed in her For- st Hills apartment and waited tables at Claybourne's. According to her, living and working in the 'Burg wasn't bad, \"There's more to do here than people think,\" she commented. Among the spots were Blue Hole, Switzer's Dam, Reddish Knob, and Westover Park. Albright took classes and lived at Ashby Crossing while working at J.C. Penney's and R.R. Donnelly, a book manufacturing company. Working two jobs was a privilege for college students this summer. Due to a troubled economy, employment was scarce, and once found it was treasured. A few fortunate students were able to find jobs in their major areas. For example, two Junior Education minors worked with children for the summer. Laura Palladin- etti taught preschoolers and Melissa Roish was a camp counselor. Junior Shelley Oli- ver had an unusual summer job setting gypsy moth traps in the mountains of Virginia. The summer for most seemed to be a combination of work and play. One of the most popular vacation plans was to spend a week at the beach. Whether it was Jersey Shore, Va. Beach, Nags Head, or Myrtle Beach, the pastimes included tanning all day and partying all night. Some students were fortunate enough to live near the ocean. Freshman Jeff Dallin worked as a lifeguard at Bellport Beach, on Long Is- land, N.Y. Lifeguarding was a way to have fun in the sun and make money as well. Despite the time taken by a job, most students managed to make their summers enjoyable. Road trips, concerts, and times spent with old friends made the months go by quickly. By about mid-July, students were anxious to return to the frenzy of activity at JMU. The long, hot, days of August were filled with outings and pic- nics in a last effort to visit high school buddies and catch up on hometown gossip. The final week of summer was spent pack- ing up and moving back to Harrisonburg to begin another year in our college ca- reers. Carrie Desmond Lining up for that perfect putt, Matt Edmonds concentrates intensely.

After enjoying the day at Panama City Beach, Florida, Dave Gaul and Erika Freihage take a walk along the shore. Days at the beach were usually active and well-spent. Summer Fun 25 The Commute How to get there K Being a commuter student meant hav- ing privacy, independence and a taste of what it would be like to be on our own. With the onset of the new parking regula- tions, being a commuter student also meant depending on some mode of trans- portation other than cars to get to campus. For those who didn't ride bikes and who were not up to walking to campus every- day, that left the bus as the remaining solution. This year, students piled on the buses in record numbers, and it made for some interesting trips to campus. It seemed to be the case that students took the last possible bus they could to make it to class on time, especially the early morning classes. Those who did not want to miss that bus did some pretty strange things to make sure they were on it. For instance, senior Doug Kidd was known to perform part of his morning rou- tine at the bus stop. \"I had to shave at the bus stop one time,\" said Kidd. \"I got some pretty strange looks, but I didn't want to miss the bus!\" Others who took every precaution to be at that bus stop on time sometimes still got left behind. \"The first week of classes a whole bunch of us were waiting at the bus stop, and the bus was so full when it got to us that it just kept on going. We all had to Bikes, an alternative to the bus system, clutter bike racks, fences and lampposts throughout campus. Bike riding provided a method of recreation as well as transportation for off-campus residents. walk to class,\" said senior Susan Davis. The crowded buses provoked the ap- pearance of more bikers than ever on cam- pus. This was not without its problems; with the added traffic, pedestrian/biker accidents were common. Ciarlo was hit by a biker while crossing the street in front of the campus center. \"I fell down, and he fell off his bike. I felt bad for him though, because he was going pretty fast, and he bent his bike all up,\" said Ciarlo. Senior Jenny Morris remembered a time when a similar situation almost oc- cured between several people and a bus. \"We had just had a storm, and the road was covered with ice. A whole bunch of us were waiting at the Ashby Crossing bus stop, and when the bus came down the hill towards us, it couldn't stop on the ice. All these people scattered in a million differ- ent directions, and the bus finally man- aged to come to a stop a few feet from the bus stop.\" Despite the complaints, the bus system did make life much easier for the commut- er students. As senior Alison Lippincott said, \"The school does what it can to acco- modate commuters. You can always walk!\" Frandee Heaton 26 Commuting Commuters board the bus at Godwin Hall bus stop. The bus shuttled off campus residents to and from campus making stops at fifteen minute intervals. Ashby Crossing residents await the arrival of a bus to take them to campus.

You headed back :o the room only to discover that all the \"urniture had been placed on your bed be- muse your roommate and some friends were practicing for their Ballroom Danc- ng final. Grudgingly, you trucked off to he library. For some reason you did not juite make it there. It seemed there was iome strong physical attraction to a large >reen rectangle. Naturally, you did not try o resist its pull and you located a nice ;hady area and began studying. While some people could not concen- rate because of all the people on the )uad, others found it to be a pleasant itudy environment. The numerous trees provided enough shade to make reading possible and there were many benches scattered throughout the area. As junior Vlary Jayne Lee stated, \"The Quad is a >reat place to go in between classes. It is 'ery relaxing and I can actually get things lone. I like it much better than the ibrary.\" For other students the Quad was a great )lace to hang out. During the warmer veather many people played frisbee, ossed a football, or watched as their dogs :hased unsuspecting students. With the lumerous activities that occurred, the )uad was an excellent place to scope. \"It's i great place to people-watch,\" admitted unior Althea Early. For those lucky enough to get a low lousing number, life on the Quad was an >ption. Males had a choice between Ashby and Spotswood Halls while the females could live in Ashby. Students who lived on the Quad swore by it. \"You haven't lived until you have lived on the Quad. It is a perfect location for everything and there is always something to do, from sunbathing to ultimate frisbee. My advice to freshman is not to move off campus until you have had a chance to live on the Quad,\" ex- plained junior Jodi Yingling. Aside from being amidst all the action, the Quad was a central location for many classes. Senior C. Douglas Smith said, \"I don't understand why people would live away from the Quad. In the morning I can just roll out of bed and if I keep rolling, I'll hit Jackson for class.\" Senior Michelle McCord agreed, \"The Quad is great be- cause everything is so close. All my classes are in Harrison and if I forget something I can go back to my room between classes.\" While the Quad may have seemed like the ideal place to study, scope or just so- cialize many saw it as a very attractive part of campus. Sophomore Julie Monrad stated, \"While I enjoy playing frisbee or studying on the Quad, I love the view from Main Street facing Wilson Hall just as the sun is setting.\" Many students went so far as to say that they were proud of the Quad. Stated junior Robin Parker, \"The Quad is always the first place I would take some- one visiting JMU. It's clearly the most beautiful place on campus.\" Anna Selden In the shade of one of the trees on the quad, Stafford TJrown reviews notes for an upcoming test.

But what was missing from that list? It seemed that in all the rush around campus a very important element was lost - romance. \"Where is it?\", asked junior Kimberly Mckie. \"Love is where you find it\", replied senior Ed Rhett, but evidently JMU was not the place to look for it. Yes, people still dated, but even those in relationships felt there was not as much romance as they would like. So what exactly were students looking for? When asked to list qualities that the perfect boyfriend would possess, women responded most frequently with sensitivity, honesty, intelligence and a sense of humor. Men, on the other hand, wanted someone who was good-looking, sensitive to their needs, fun and caring. (Just for the record, most people said they desired these same qualities in their perfect mate. A few add- ed independence, faithfulness and good parenting skills.) After describing their perfect boyfriends and girlfriends, stu- dents were asked what they would do on their dream dates. Though some details varied - some wanted to fly to Australia or the Caribbe- an while others preferred to stay at home with a hot tub and strawberries - both women and men included candlelit dinners on the beach with a bottle of fine wine or champagne. Sophomore Raquel Chiquillo commented, \"I think that romance at JMU is mostly in the minds of people; I don't see it.\" Even if romantic displays were not present in everyday reality, they were certainly vivid in the imagination of students. The description by John Allen, also a sophomore, was probably the most exotic image. \"We'd be in the Bahamas on a clear, moonlit night and watch a breath- taking meteor shower. After taking a walk down the beach, we'd sit in front of a fire and have a bottle of champagne chilling. We'd go for a swim and then embrace, caress, talk, laugh, kiss and make love all night long while the warm surf washes over us.\" But maybe all of that idealizing was the reason for the lack of romance. Romance did not have to be so elaborate that fanta- sy replaced reality; it should have en- hanced reality. Maybe by searching for the perfect match a lot of almost perfect people were overlooked. And maybe a lot of relationships could have improved if ev- eryone realized that sometimes the occa- sional sweet little gestures - the notes that said, \"I love you\" or the single flower for no special reason - would have made all the diference.

On August 24, the Class of 1995 had its day and it was no less confusing. In addition to the heat and humidity, 2150 freshmen with their families and friends had to put up with traffic jams, boxes of loft materials to be carried from J-lot to the dorms and crowded stairwells. After a long drive in the family car with your parents lecturing on the im- portance of the upcoming year, the last thing you wanted to do was walk up and Rutlcdge It's a strenuous haul on that chaotic Saturday in August. Some freshmen resort to desperate means to move their overpacked boxes. Kevin Scott is extremely grateful for the help he receives from his father in moving. Most fresh- men could not have survived moving day without the aid of friends and family. down flights of stairs moving all those so- called necessities you could not live without. In fact, the only thing that kept you going was the thought of the departure of your parents and the arrival of your college life. \"The worst aspect of moving in was having to carry loads of clothes, books and junk up three flights of stairs. Fortunately, volunteers helped with this nuisance and made me feel real welcome. That's the best thing I can say about JMU, as soon as you unload you real- ize how friendly JMU people really are,\" said freshman Adrienne Brown, a resident at Hill- side Hall. Some freshmen did not have such luck and did not know what they were in for when they arrived. As a result of the increase in fresh- man enrollment from last year, 26 freshmen were housed in study lounges, 61 freshmen and transfers were tripled in double rooms and 66 were placed in good ole' Howard Johnson's. Needless to say, these \"dorm\" rooms were not what they expected. \"When I first found out that I was going to spend my freshman year in a hotel room that was sort of off-campus. I felt like I had been cheated. But once I saw the luxuries I'd have I felt priviledged,\" said freshman Daniel Raphael. The remaining freshmen were housed in the Village, Hillside or Eagle. Each of these offered students advantages which made them think their \"home\" was better than the rest. Freshmen living in the Village, which housed the greatest number of first year stu- dents, were given the opportunity to share a suite with others where they could watch TV, hang out or party together. In Eagle, students could watch JMU football games from their windows and were close to Mrs. Green's. Fi- nally, Hillside provided air-conditioning, a fitness center and a short walk to P.C. Dukes and the Campus Center. Despite the heat of the day and all of the confusion of moving in, the Class of 1995 survived its first JMU day. Roommates got to know one another, decorated their rooms and received a warm welcome at the Fresh- men Convocation and Watermelon Social. Then it was time to start the year off right and become a real JMU Duke.

The return of the 'shroom allows students to specify a universal meeting place for meals and activi- ties. Students were successful in pe- titioning the 'shroom's comeback. 34 Back by Demand Upon Request Back by popular demand m> Inevitably, change occurred at JMU ev- pry year. Students promoted improvement ^nd reform, and the campus was gradually transformed as each new class entered. This year, three renovated structures readmitted to the University. The lushroom, Burruss Hall and Howard Johnson's were all resurrected. Students reacted positively to the additions. The 'Shroom had been a common meet- ing place for students at meal time. At the lime of its removal, the kiosk was red and ited in front of entrances 4 and 5 of D- \"It had a personality of its own. I [hink every student on this campus had told friends to meet them there at one joint or another,\" said junior Jennifer Jendron. \"It's a tradition.\" Regardless of le altered color and location, the IShroom has retained its status as a JMU landmark. Another renovation the student body |felcomed this fall was that of Burruss lall. The new math and science building las well worth the wait. The additional space provided extra classrooms, state of the art equipment and computer facilities. Junior Shelley Oliver was happy with the new Burruss because the conditions were \"a lot better conditions than those of the trailers.\" Finally students were able to tra- verse to Miller without trekking through mud and around construction obstacles. The return of Howard Johnson's creat- ed a new obstacle -- Interstate 81. Due to an overwhelming response from this year's freshman class, extra housing was needed to put up freshman and transfers. Fresh- man Anne Nguyen was disappointed when she first received her off campus housing assignment. All she could think was, \"Why me?\" However, she quickly adjusted to her room and began to enjoy the luxuries of motel life. Residents appreciated the close-knit atmosphere HoJo's afforded. Anne's roommate, Jeannie Palmer summed up the general feeling: \"We are closer since there's only sixty of us. We get to know everyone really well.\" Neighbor Jeri Condie agreed, \"Here we have more friends rather than just lots of acquaint- ances.\" Junior Alice Riddick reminisced about her own freshman year at Howard John- son's. \"We were in a class by ourselves,\" Alice smiled. Senior Rob Piano lived at HoJo's two years in a row. He remem- bered the \"community aspect. ..lots of fun- ...lots of parties,\" and said that he \"wouldn't have traded it\" once he was there. It seems obvious that the added dorm space, the new appearance and facilities of Burruss, and the return of the 'Shroom were all welcome additions to JMU. A distinctive characteristic was the continu- ing of old traditions which thrive in an atmosphere open to change and improve- ment. Such a combination of the old and the new is what has made JMU such a diverse and attractive campus. Carrie Desmond & Marni O'Connell Upon receiving the announcement that they were living in HoJo's, certain freshmen and and transfers encountered mixed emotions. Having lived the year there, most would choose to return if given the oppor- tunity. Spacious living quarters is one of the positive aspects of living in Howard Johnson's.

Getting a head start on a preferred ca- reer, working with other people and a little extra cash were popular reasons that stu- dents decided to work. With the amount and variety of employment opportunities available on campus, most students did not have to go far to find that perfect job. Some students found that they were able to work while in school at a job relat- ed to their field of study. For example, at Gibbons Dining Hall, all management and other positions were filled by management students. These students were responsible not only for duties relating directly to meal preparation but also for the hiring and firing of other students. Student Produc- tion Manager senior Anne Watson said, \"We employ an average of three-hundred students. Lots of them quit after a year, but many stay on and work for several years.\" Other majors were able to find work through the College Service Center. Freshman Nicole Motley worked at the Television Production Center. Nicole said, \"I wanted to work there because I am a communications major and it will be good experience for me in a field related to my major, in addition to making some extra money.\" For other students it was the social as- pect of their jobs that they enjoyed. Work- ing with students was often the main bene- fit. John Sandhofer, a second year Resident Advisor, loved his job because it gave him a chance to work with people and recommended it to other students. \"Every- one should have the experience for at least one year,\" said Sandhofer. \"I would do it even if I did not get paid.\" Junior Susan Watts also enjoyed her job at the reserve desk of Carrier Library. \"It's a great place to work,\" said Watts. \"I'm in the air con- ditioning and my friends come by and visit me.\" The extra cash that these jobs brought in was one of the biggest advantages ac- cording to most students. Junior Chris Howard was a Resident Advisor for the second year. \"The money is for the little things,\" said Howard. \"But the job de- pends on the person. It is not for Mr. and Ms. I wanna be social.\" In addition, the Financial Aid Office was able to recom- mend and help place those students who needed employment in jobs suited to them. Whether they were washing the dishes at D-Hall, working at the library or keep- ing watch over their residents, students on campus found an almost unlimited num- ber of job opportunities available to them.

Here, anyone could cher- ish the calm soothing atmosphere of na- ture. Juniors Claudine Caracciolo and Dave Meredith visited this area regularly. \"We hiked up there, fed the deer and watched the leaves change colors,\" remembered Claudine. \"It was so still, so peaceful.\" Juniors Lisa Farrar and Cindy Pendleton also trekked along the trails of Skyline Drive with their boyfriends. Lisa described her hike to Dark Hollow Falls as \"a relax- ing way to spend my Sunday.\" Other favorite haunts were Reddish Knob, Switzer's Dam, Blue Hole and vari- ous nearby lakes and parks. Hillandale Park and Purcell Park are two recreation- al spots set within the residential area of Harrisonburg. Mountain biking and camping were also popular ways to spend time on a sunny day or a cool night. Students invested in the proper gear for such activities by purchas- ing or borrowing biking attire, hiking boots, sleeping bags and tents. Camping equipment could be rented from the cam- pus Recreational Department. JMU provided plenty of diversions for restless students, but the Valley always at- tracted the adventurers.

The decade that brought us Michael Milliken and the junk bond, Ollie North and Iran-Contra, Nintendo, and the fitness craze. Americans spent millions of dollars each year trying to lose weight, gain muscle and just look better in a swimsuit. Unlike Ollie and Milliken, the desire to be healthy did not fade away. In fact, JMU's various weight rooms and aerobics classes were more crowded than ever. This was partly because more students were concerned with physical fitness. However, there were more people on campus this year. The combination of the two factors drove more and more students out of the JMU weight and fitness faclities and into alternative exercise areas. Cycling was popular with students this year, as was taking advantage of the jog- ging trails around campus. However, one of the most common responses to the crowded JMU facilities was to join private fitness clubs. Harrisonburg businesses such as Valley Wellness Center, Women's Health Center and Nautilus Fitness Cen- ter drew many students away from campus and into the clubs. Said senior Kristen Simpson, \"The gyms were just too packed. I wanted to be able to work out without having to stand in line to use a machine.\" This was a sentiment echoed by many stu- dents. Anyone who tried to get on a stair climber at a JMU fitness room between 3:30 and 4:30 p.m. knew all about crowded facilities. The private clubs were especially popu- lar with students who lived off campus. Such students did not want to bother with going to class, going home and then re- turning to campus later to work out. \"When I leave campus for the day, I really don't want to go back later. If I work out off campus, it's like another part of my day; I'm not running around in circles,\" said senior Kristan Mackey. Although many students did choose to exercise at private clubs, they did not seem to mob the faclities. According to Jeff Fitzwater, a manager at Nautilus Fitness Center, JMU students did not constitute the majority of the membership. Fitzwater said, \"When the college students return, you can definately tell the club is more crowded, but it is not overwhelming.\" The gyms, both on and off campus, of- fered students more than just an opportu- nity to get into shape, it also offered em- ployment. The aerobics instructors and weight room attendants on campus were almost all students. Some students were instructors at clubs such as Iron World. Nautilus manager Jeff Fitzwater stated that three employees are students and one student is completing an internship. Even though Governor Douglas Wilder denied JMU funding for new fitness and recreation facilities, students still found ways to keep in shape. Whether they rode their bicycles around Harrisonburg, took aerobics at the Valley Wellness Center, lifted weights in Godwin or even hiked in the George Washington National Forest,. JMU's health-conscious students found ways to work off those extra pounds. Ollie North and Michael Milliken were all but forgotten, Nintendo was out of vouge, but taking care of your body still remained one of JMU students' concerns.

Excellence In step with tradition It was 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning, members of the Marching Royal Dukes rolled out of bed to hit their screaming alarm clocks. It was time again to get up early after an eventful Friday night to practice for the day's football event in the chilling, brisk morning air. For most nor- mal people this would have been a bother- some nightmare, and for many MRD's it was a time to reflect on the reason for being in the band. To be \"Virginia's Fin- est\" took a lot of time, effort and energy but the awards, as most band members agreed, vastly outweighed the drawbacks. For freshmen and seniors alike, the band was a great place to make friends. Senior Shira Cline expressed, \"It's a lot of hard work, but it's a lot of fun too. ..you meet a lot of great people.\" To many, the band was a big family, and the network of friendships was irreplacable. To the dismay of afternoon nappers, the MRD's practiced every weekday of game weeks on the field in front of Hillside. On the average, individuals put nine hours a week into rehearsal during the regular sea- son. During the week-long band camp be- fore school started, the MRD's practiced around the clock with barely any free time. It became evident that there was some- thing more to the marching band than the one hour of credit. \"And now. ..The James Madison Marching Royal Dukes!!!\" After the crowd was entranced by the spectacular performance at football games, they in- variably gave the MRD's a standing ova- tion. Feeling the energy from the crowd was an exciting factor for many members , of the band. To sophomore Sheri Ellis, \"Pulling off a great performance after! working hard and getting a positive feed-^» w back from the crowd is the best part.\" \"When people stay to watch instead of getting a Coke or going home right after! the game,\" stated senior Drum Major Lori Lerew, \"...it's really a neat feeling.\" Even though lasting friendships and adrenaline! pumps from the crowd were great incen-i tives to some, others enjoyed the band for the sole reason of playing their instru- ments. To Lillian Gregorio \"kicking offj the cadence\" on her bass drum was am unequaled experience and \"just playing trumpet,\" gave Doug Rose contentment. This year the MRD's as an organization marched on the field with twenty years ofj experience. Since the birth of the band, the MRD's have defined the meaning ofj \"Purple Pride\" by bringing many years ofl tradition and musical excellence to JMU The twentieth anniversary edition of thei Marching Royal Dukes was the best yet with a season finale as the featured band at the Bands of America Grand Nationals! in the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome. The fans in the stadium saw only the result of the immense quality of time, ef- fort and energy. But hidden underneat the purple and gold shimmer of the uni' forms and the shine of the instruments, members of the Marching Royal Dukes cherished the lasting times that made be- ing a part of the MRD's one of the best experiences of a lifetime.

Paying Bills Making cents of it all You have got a few minutes between classes so you decide to check your mail in hopes that you actually got some. Perhaps the guilt trip phone call to mom warranted a care package. After flipping through your boxmates' letters, postcards and three package slips you see something with your name on it. Why does it seem that the only people that regularly write to you are Visa, Texaco and JMU Telecomm? Your memory slowly wanders back to that fateful day. The day you filled out your first credit card application. Phrases like \"no fee,\" \"$1000 credit line\" and \"special student offer\" were looming on every bulletin board. Suddenly it did not matter if you had the money to pay for that new Nintendo game. You'd just charge it and pay it off— slowly. This the- ory seems almost ideal because most credit cards required that you pay only $10 a month. However, some students would run into problems when they actually used this method. The solution was to eliminate the problem. Explained senior Rose Diggs, \"My credit cards and I go through a cycle.

Any on campus student that wanted to keep in touch with the world outside of the four digit extension number needed a Tele- comm Account number. Bills ranged from the service fee of $4.50 to what ever the student could afford. \"My lowest bill was about $70 and my highest was $146 during my freshman year,\" stated junior Hannah Hinely. Yet, many students don't mind the high phone bills. As sophomore Julie Monrad said, \"My biggest priority is keep- ing in touch with my friends. Plus I have to pay to call my parents in Denver, but it is definately worth it.\" Added junior Melissa Stevens, \"I've called home quite a bit this year. Last year my bills were about $12, but this year they range from $40-$50.\" Some studnets were forced to get jobs in order to account for phone, Visa and cred- it card bills. As a result, the majority of the paycheck went to cover the month's charges. \"When I get my paycheck about half of it goes to cover my car payments, some of it gets sent to Visa, and whatever is left goes to odds and ends and going out,\" explained junior Jo Britton. There are some people on campus, how- ever, that decide if they do not have the money to cover a purchase they will not get it. \"If I do not have the cash or I don't have enough money in my checking ac- count then I decide that I really don't need whatever it is,\" stated junior Robin Parker. If that idea does not seem to work: for you, then try leaving your credit cards alone. The best way to avoid temptation is not to bring them along. While all students will leave JMU with a high quality education, some will leave with just a bit more. Senior Mark Wassonj said, \"The bills. The bills. When I leave! here I will still have the bills.\" Anna Seldei Kutledge 46 Bills 1 I Senior Sherri Gray uses the bank machine for quick and easy access to her money.

Frats were a popular place to party Fright Night. 48 Halloween BOO! Spider webs hanging from door frames, jack o'lanterns in the windows and everything from Dracula to Dan uayle roaming the halls. Only Hallow- :en could provide students with the op- portunity to express themselves in every ay, shape and form. Decorating for Halloween was a good way for some students to get into the mood. Some residence halls held contests for the best door decorations and others decorated for the fun of it. Freshman Amy Cocarro of Eagle Hall said, \"I don't know exactly why we decided to decorate the hall. I guess we got in a wierd mood and just felt like it.\" Cotton spider webs, plastic spiders and card- board cutouts of skeletons proved to be the most popular decorations. For other students, decorating their rooms was the least of their concerns. Finding the perfect costume was more important. Basic ghosts and goblins could be seen roaming campus and near- by apartment complexes, while a few stu- dents had more complex costumes. Some couples opted to dress as each other and the Chi Phi pledge class fashioned themsleves after the fraternity in the movie \"Revenge of the Nerds.\" Since fall break fell on the Friday fol- lowing Halloween, some students were able to be home for the occasion. So- phomre Leslie Reed said, \"I'm gald that I'm going to be home on Halloween so I can give out candy to the little kids when they go trick-or-treating because I like little children.\" Other students planned to go trick-or-treating themselves. \"I love to dress up and go trick-or-treat- ing,\" said freshman Colleen Magin. \"I look forward to it every year.\" Students that decided to remain at school found lots to do, too. There were plenty of parties for students to attend. Senior Jim Acri said, \"This Halloween was my 21st birthday. You better believe 1 was going to party!\" However, not everyone was as excited about their Halloween and Fall Break plans. Junior Kim Jankic said, \"I had to spend my whole Halloween weekend do- ing field training exercises with ROTC.\" Halloween was eagerly anticipated by most students.

Through an assort- ment of unique and different sports, the intramural sports department was a popu- lar alternative for many students. Aside from the variety of sports, the JMU intra- mural program presented a number of clinics and improvement programs to heighten and improve one's game. The tennis clinic taught the the fundamentals as well as stressing the important mental aspects of the game. When students arrived in the fall, they were met with a variety of options to fulfill their intramural needs. Tennis was popu- lar, but extremely competetive, due to its tournament and seeded format. Flag Foot- ball, although an early winter sport, was also a fun activity that attracted a lot of athletes. Pickle Ball was fairly new and popular based on its uniqueness as an in- tramural sport. Badminton and raquetball were also popular, especially with the JMU women, while ping-pong was fun for those who preferred an indoor activity to those outside. In the spring, intramural sports were just as strong. Indoor as well as outdoor soccer was extremely popular for most JMU students. Outdoor soccer was heightened by the experience of playing on astroturf amid the splendor of the archi- tecture of Bridgeforth Stadium, home to the JMU Dukes football team. This facili- ty greatly enhanced the competetive spirit of intramural sports. In addition, track and field, a rarity at most other intramural college programs, was a good way for run- ners to improve their times as well as burn off the huge number of calories from D- Hall's food. Spring was just as impressive Warming up for his tennis match, Dayle Sanford practices to perfect his serve. Tennis was not only a popular sport, but it also provided for a good work- out. as the fall season in providing an assort- ment of sports to please even the most finicky sports enthusiastits. The JMU intramural sports program was successful in presenting a diverson from the academic challenges as well as providing an outlet for fun and good times. It was also successful in maintaining just an inkling of the competitiveness and per- serverance prevalent in JMU's inter-colle- giate sports.

Where to Eat The choice is yours m> Rumble, grumble, growl. Ah, the won- derful sound of an empty stomach. For those students with a meal contract, JMU Food Services offered a plethora of places to choose from. If you could actually drag yourself out of bed, there were three options for break- fast. Both D-Hall and P.C. Dukes were open, but only D-Hall accepted meal con- tracts. Students willing to make the trek had the option of eating at Mrs. Green's, which specialized in gourmet coffee, fresh bagels from Mr. J's, cereals, fruits and danishes. This was a popular choice for business students because Chandler was located next to the Business Building. \"I like going to Mrs. Green's for breakfast because I can get a fresh bagel and an excellent cup of gourmet coffee. The cof- fee tastes good and it wakes me up for that early morning cramming,\" confessed ju- nior Robin Parker. On warmer days people had the choice of take-out available from Dukes, Green's and Pepe's. \"I really enjoy eating outside when the weather permits it. It's very re- laxing and provides a nice change from D- Hall,\" explained sophomore Julie Monrad. One of the major changes was the addi- tion of Pepe's. Located at the top of the Warren Campus Center, Pepe's replaced Top Dog and served an all Mexican menu. Many students were upset with the elimi- nation; however, American Pie compen- sated by serving hot dogs. \"Pepe's was a good idea because Mexican food is always popular. It's also nice not having to clean up after yourself,\" continued Monrad. Yet not all students mourned the loss of Top Dog. Stated junior Marie Buntua,\"I am glad that they changed Top Dog. Pepe's has much better food.\" Lunchtime was by far the most crowded time to eat because both on and off cam- pus students were being served. Yet, day after day people battled the twenty minute wait to get into D-Hall. For many off cam- pus students it was their only chance to get a complete meal. \"I like D-Hall because it has a broad selection. It is my only oppor- tuntiy to get a full meal because I never cook like that for myself at home,\" said junior Jeanne Bollendorf. Come dinnertime, students had the reg- ular choices of D-Hall, Dukes and the Steakhouse, but Food Services threw in a new option. Pasta Uno, located at En- trance 1, replaced Spaghetti Western and offered only Italian cuisine. Commented junior Becky Wood, \"Pasta Uno was a nice change of pace. D-Hall serves too much chicken for me.\" Perhaps the most popular place to eat dinner was the Steakhouse. Students were allotted ten punches per semester and res- ervations were required. Diners chose from either steak or chicken as the entree, two vegetables, a salad bar, drinks and gourmet desserts. \"The Steakhouse is great because they serve somewhat differ- ent food. It's nice to be waited on and not have to leave a tip. The best nights are when they serve french silk pie, grasshop- per pie or the chocolate mousses,\" said junior Karin Starr. Overall, students were satisfied with the choice of food. While D-Hall won't quite replace a home-cooked meal, it met the needs of the many hungry Dukes. Anna Selden The picnic tables on the lawn outside Duke's provide an open atmosphere for food and conversation. ing Options 53 Having Fun // in good faith m- Going to college often meant leaving the comfort of family and friends who shared the same beliefs and faith. Fortunately, students who came to JMU found a sup- port system of friends through its many religious organizations. Groups ranged in size from under 20 people to over 200, with over five religious affiliations repre- sented. There were also several non-de- nominational groups. Inter Varsity was among the biggest groups on campus. With over 200 mem- bers, their activities included big group meetings, small group meetings, social events and mission projects which sent sev- eral IV members to foreign countries over the summer. Essen Daley said all of IV's activities were directed at one goal. \"The purpose of IV is to engage the campus with the gospel of Jesus Christ, and we do everything to bring that about,\" Daley said. \"It's where you learn what a real relationship is like and that's the one found in Christ,\" said Troy Williams. The Baptist Student Union was one of the largest denominational groups, though any student could join. Their activities in- cluded community projects such as visiting nursing homes and Saturday Adoption for children. The entire group met on Thurs- day for fellowship and on Friday for Bible study. Randy Dunn, president of the BSU, said the variety of people involved in the group made it a unique place for fellow- ship. \"It's just amazing how so many dif- ferent people can come together and be so excited for one purpose,\" Dunn said. Campus Crusade was another group which incorporated Bible study, campus outreach to non-Christians and social events to provide support. \"It's dedication to getting the gospel out on the campus is an important part of the group,\" said Tonia Morell. The Westminister Fellowship was a smaller Presbyterian group. Members of- ten ate dinner at various sponsoring facul- ty's homes and went on camping trips and retreats. \"The professors cook dinners for us and we in turn cook brunch for them [at Easter],\" said Gina Levare, a member of the group. The Fellowship of Christian Athletes provided a special opportunity for mem- bers to share their love of God and their enjoyment of sports. Besides Bible studies and speakers, FCA also enjoyed intramu- ral sports and Monday Night Football. \"There's a feeling of us being a family and because of the size of the group we could get to know everyone personally,\" said Sandy Woodin. Jen Fournier added, \"It really provides a stable fellowship for me.\" One of the most vocal religious groups on campus was the Contemporary Gospel Singers. Along with performing at local churches, the singers gave concerts at JMU on Parent's Weekend, at Homecom- ing and at Christmas. Their weekly meet- ings included Bible study, choir practice and praise. \"It edifies me spiritually, just to be there and feel other students sharing a common purpose. When we get there it's a relief from the hustle and bustle of the week's activities,\" said Jeneen Robinson. Friendships made by a shared faith were important to the members of these organi- zations. \"I think most people make some of their best friends there,\" Daley said about IV. Concerts, religious services and social events became shared experiences. Finding a place to feel comfortable and accepted was not very difficult through the many opportunities for religious fellow- ship.

This s\\stem » as comparable to the modern day PC. 56 Past Progressions Change over time «► Anyone remotely familiar with the JMU campus in recent years could proba- bly have developed a long list of the changes taking place. A major renovation or constuction job took place in almost every year since President Carrier took his position in 1971. All of the obvious devel- opment on campus and the many more subtle changes that occurred were impor- tant because they marked the growth and improvement that made the university a rapidly changing and exciting place to be. The most influential cause of the changes was the increasing enrollment through the years. The 1980's saw an in- crease from 8,000 to 11,000 students, the most dramatic increases within the most recent years. This growth affected all as- pects of the school, but most obviously the living arrangements. \"Having so many- students forced the university to fill its residence areas almost to full capacity,\" said Sean Bates, hall director of Weaver. \"There were also a lot of changes as far as the location of freshman and which dorms were single sex or co-ed,\" he added. 1987 saw the addition of Hillside Hall in the Hillside area where Bell and McGraw- Long had housed students since 1982 and 1984 respectively. This reduced the hous- ing strain and helped to change residence halls like Johnston and Shenandoah into office space, another rarity at a growing school. The end of the decade brought the quad's most recent addition - the blue- stone Music Building. In the new decade, the stylish Sonner Hall sprang up by the lake to house the Office of Career Ser- vices. D-Hall was also renovated and the pedestrian plaza appeared by Carrier Library. During the time Burruss was being en- larged and renovated with science labora- tories, the campus' most recent source of pride, the $9 million Business Building was under construction. The glass double doors of the towering Zane D. Showaker Hall swung open to students in the fall of 1991, exposing the marble lobby, springy office chairs in modern lecture halls and This student recovers after a rough night. Although the buildings stand the same, many rules and regula- tions have changed drastically. contemporary color schemes. But the physical developments on cam- pus were not the only changes. A fifth year student in 1991-92 may have noticed that the tuition was 25% more than it was the first year; 33% if out-of-state. If he was an out-of-state student living on campus, it would cost $3,346 more than in 1987. The increased expenses helped fund some important aspects of JMU. The school was able to maintain its faculty/s- tudent ratio in recent years despite large increases in enrollment. The university continued to update its computer capabili- ties with such developments as the VAX, and the modern conveniences of telephone registration were available. There were also some changes concern- ing admissions to JMU. The male/female and in-state/out ratios were very steady, but there were increased minority accep- tances. The black population grew from 6.8% in 1986 to about 10% in 1991, and minorities, as a group, increased by almost 5%. Bonnie Swank Powell, Acting Office Supervisor of Admissions and a 1981 graduate of JMU, noted that this increase was a combination of two influences - uni- verstiy policy and larger numbers of mi- nority applicants. \"There's more opportu- nity for everyone to learn, when we have varying points of view,\" she said. Powell also cited more AP and Honors courses among applicants as evidence of the in- creasing quality of students. Pete Cofer, a December 1990 graduate, noticed how the changes at JMU affected Harrisonburg as well. \"A large part of the growth in Harrisonburg would have to do with student housing-they put in five or six apartment complexes to meet the demand and soon there are new restaurants and bars.\" The new gas stations and additions to Valley Mall relied on the business of JMU students as well, Cofer noted. John Rogers Past 57 Progressions This was JMU in 1991 -- a university growing in size and reputation, acclaimed by several publications as \"public ivy\" and a \"best buy.\" Development eased off in the beginning of the new school year as if the whole campus took a deep breath and col- lected itself for the next rush of construc- tion. The emphasis was on growing grass around the new buildings and landscaping before the parents arrived for their week- end in early October. Harrisonburg pro- vided a miniature golf course and batting cage, and foootball fans welcomed the winning ways of new head coach Rip Scherer. It was a time to stop and review the progress and then begin again, leading the way towards the 21st century. Students looked forward to more ad- vancements on campus. They would know the future had arrived when there was somewhere to park on or near university property. They waited for the new JAC card to provide more services, such as pho- tocopying in the library and running dor- mitory laundry machines. More extensive computer systems and telecommunica- tions were just around the corner. By far, the most anticipated event of the near fu- ture was the development of the College of Applied Science and Technology, which would drastically change the school that JMU was. In February 1988, the Virginia General Assembly created a commission on the University of the 21st Century, to explore the possibility of drastically increasing un- dergraduate enrollment in the new centu- ry, while developing more modern tech- niques of education. In June, JMU appointed the Greater University Com- mission to discuss whether and how the school should grow. What began to form, was an idea potentially pleasing to all in- volved. The College of Applied Science and Technology, to be built on the other side of Interstate 81, would enroll three thousand students by the year 2000, and use innovative methods of education. Steps were quickly taken to make it more than an idea. \"Progress is being made,\" said Dr. Barbara Castello, who oversaw the early growth of the college. The new college quickly gained approv- als from the General Assembly and the 58 Present/Future State Council for Higher Education as it became more of a reality. It was worth noting that UVa, Virginia Tech and Rad- ford all submitted plans for their 21st cen- tury schools, none of which met with such immediate success. Only JMU's plan was approved for operating funds in the 1991 state budget. President Carrier was instru- mental in drumming up support, and, per- haps more importantly, in finding the right mixture of private and public funds for the new college. It was stated early and often that there would be no drain on the exist- ing campus. The hallmark of Carrier's leadership has been development and improvement. The changes, both obvious and subtle, are the results of an aggressive pursuit of growth. Students witnessed impressive ex- pansion and improvement in recent years and plans forecast more for the future; and most impressive was the way JMU main- tained its identity amid so much change. John Rogers Previously a farm, this land will eventually house the new Col- lege of Applied Science and Technology that is planned for the future. If all goes well, students will begin being admitted in 1995. The Quad is one of the few ihmgs that did not change drastical- ly over time.

For many years, the Changing of the uard has been a momentous occasion for interested spectators. Overseas Absorbing the culture m For many students, the world portrayed in works by Wordsworth or plays by Ra- cine do not exist beyond the pages of the text. Yet, several selectively chosen stu- dents were given the chance to actually see the sights. The Studies Abroad program took thirty students per semester to Lon- don, England and twenty-five students per semester to Paris, France. Requirements were based on grade level as well as grade point average. Seniors and juniors were given priority in order of their GPAs. Students were required to have at least a 2.8 to apply, while rising sopho- mores needed a 3.0. Aside from room and board, students were required to pay an additional fee above the standard tuition fee. Many students took twelve hours, but were encouraged to take no more than fifteen credit hours. In London, the classes ranged from British Literature, art, or even architecture, to British politics, the- ater, and an international humanities course. All the courses offered were for three credits. Students did not spend all of the class time in a lecture room. Several professors led tours around the city of London. In accordance with this, some classes re- quired students to fill out a journal de- scribing their experiences. The students who studied in Paris took classes similar to those offered in London. The only difference was that the majority of classes were taught in French. While a background in French was not required, it was strongly recommended. According to senior Andrea Martin, \"The people were very understanding, as long as you tried. They were excited about teaching you the language.\" Martin also believes that there is a misconception about Parisians being rude. \"Like people in any city, they are in a hurry. Outside of the city people are very friendly\", she continued. Both programs gave students a one week mid-semester vacation. Students were en- couraged to travel during this time period. \"I was able to travel a lot. I went to Scot- land, Wales, France, Belgium and Hol- land,\" reported senior Michelle Wee. Some students also took advantage of free weekends to explore Europe. \"We had two weekends that were open so I went to Bel- gium one time and Switzerland the other weekend,\" said Martin. Because of the cost of airfare, students were not able to come back to the States during their stay. However, many students were successful in encouraging their fam- ilies to visit. \"I stayed the entire four months, but my family came and visited for awhile,\" said Lara Lojacono. The most rewarding aspect of the Stud- ies Abroad programs was that it gave the students the chance to live what they were studying. The French Art classes included trips to such famous museums as the Louve and the Centre Pompidou. Students who took the French Theater classes at- tended performances of works by Moliere and Racine. Students who took English Political Science classes observed trials and visited the houses of Parliament. As Lojacono stated, \"I learned a lot more because I didn't just read it, I lived it.\" Anna Selden Studies Abroad 61 Stanton Stephanie Bekhor, Kevin Zippier and Mimi Granados pose in front of La Alberca in Spain.

For those who studied in Florence, Italy, this was a common sight. The similarities seemed to end there as students stayed in the Hotel Tirreno in the Center of the University of Florence. Students often shared a room with one or two other students and had either private or adjacent bathrooms. A big advantage of Florence was the size of the city. It was possible to walk around the entire place in about half an hour. Spending a semester in Salamanca was a bit different in that students lived with Spanish families. These families provided meals, a laundry service and accepted stu- dents as members of their families. This provided an exceptional out-of-class learn- ing experience. \"The family I stayed with had a twelve-year- old son. We did lots of things together. I learned most of my Spanish with him because he spoke a bit slower and was a little more understand- ing,\" confessed junior Stephanie Bekhor. Students were not required to have knowledge of the respective language but it was generally helpful. \"I only had one semester of Italian before I went to Flor- ence but by the end I had picked up basic conversation and understood the language fairly well,\" said Allison Brothers. Even those who did have extensive knowledge of the language found speaking with natives a whole new experience. \"Even though I've taken Spanish for seven years, I was a bit apprehensive. It got much easier as I went along,\" stated Bekhor. The Studies Abroad programs also gave students an opportunity to take more spe- cialized classes in their major. Being in Italy gave Brothers, an art major, a chance to see the works of art she had studied. Students who took Italian Renaissance Art were exposed to works by artists like Michelangelo and Giotto. Due to the cost of travel, students stayed in Europe the entire four months which. The famed coliseum attracts travelers from all over the world.

Some students dealt with the loneliness by encouraging friends or family to visit. Spending a semester in a foreign coun- try gave students a good break from cam- pus life as well as a new outlook on Amei can life. Bekhor described the Spanian as \"...laid back. They aren't lazy, thi know when to have fun but they also km when to work. The family is very impor- tant to them.\" Overall, the students felt their semestei abroad was a very worthwhile experience!
