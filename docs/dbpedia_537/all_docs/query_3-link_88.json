I have, however, for the most part avoided the word \"origins,\" since it implies a much too static concept of ethnic formation. Human populations can only be said to have origins in a very broad spatial and temporal sense. To quote Sir John Myres' conclusion to his book Who Were the Greeks?, ethnic groups are \"ever in the process of becoming\" (Myres 1930: 538). The present volume, therefore, deals with one phase in the becoming of the peoples of Japan. Chronologically the book covers a span of over 1,500 years from about 400 BC to AD 1200. This time frame may seem somewhat idiosyncratic to anyone brought up on European history, but it reflects the integral position of the Japanese Islands in cultural developments on the Eurasian mainland. The period begins with the spread of rice farming to the Islands in the fifth to the fourth century BC, a process that was probably in turn related to the diffusion of ironworking through East Asia. The end of the period corresponds with the East Asian medieval economic revolution. By the twelfth century AD, trading contacts with China and her satellite states led to major social and ethnic changes at both the northern and the southern ends of the Japanese archipelago, in Hokkaido and Okinawa. It would be wrong to propose that 1492 is a date unimportant to East Asian history, since the arrival of the Europeans in Far Eastern waters in the early sixteenth century led to the establishment of a new, global trading system. As recent historical research has made abundantly clear, however, for the most part European merchants used existing Asian trade networks. No better example of this process exists than the kingdom of the Ryukyus, which became an important trading state in the early 1400s, before Columbus had even been born. Like the ethnic groups it analyzes, this book often seemed to be \"ever in the process of becoming.\" Its final completion gives me a chance to thank\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vii\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_vii.html[1/19/2011 3:45:26 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_viii\n\n< previous page\n\npage_viii\n\nnext page > Page viii\n\nmany of the people without whom it would never have been accomplished. My most heartfelt thanks must go to my parents and sister Sue and, above all, to my wife Hiroko, for their patience in the face of what must often have seemed like a strange obsession with ancient Japan. At the School of Oriental and African Studies, Professor K. N. Chaudhuri taught me that history and archaeology not only can but should mix. At Cambridge, Gina Barnes encouraged me to work on the Yayoi and has provided considerable support over the past decade. This book derives from a doctoral dissertation submitted to the Australian National University in September 1995, and a special debt of gratitude must go to my supervisors, Peter Bellwood and Ian Farrington. In Japan, invaluable assistance was provided by the staff and students of the Department of Archaeology of the University of Tokyo. Professor Okita Masa'aki and the rest of the Tenri crowd were an unfailing source of help in the Kansai. Professor Inada Takashi and the staff and students of the Department of Archaeology at Okayama University provided a friendly atmosphere in which to conduct revisions to the book in 1996 1997. This book was kindly read in part or in whole by a number of people: Akazawa Takeru, Atholl Anderson, Robert Attenborough, Ruth Barzel, Peter Bellwood, Peter Bleed, John Caiger, Walter Edwards, Ian Farrington, Roger Green, Colin Groves, Ishida Hajime, Koizumi Junko, John Maher, Gavan McCormack, Tessa Morris-Suzuki, Richard Pearson, Igor de Rachewiltz, and Tokunaga Katsushi. None of these people should be held responsible for the often rather controversial views contained in this book. In fact, several readers disagreed with some of my conclusions, but their comments were always much appreciated. I must also acknowledge the help of the following individuals and institutions: Bruce Batten, Chiyonobu Yoshimasa, Doi Naomi, Stuart Fiedel, Hara Kimie, Hayashi Kensaku, Simon Holledge, Ikehata Koichi *, Inoue Masataka, Simon Kaner, Katayama Kazumichi, C.

Yogi Keiko was not able to see this book completed, but I feel sure that no one would have been more critical of its weaknessesnot least its superficial treatment of Okinawa. Her memory is an inspiration for research still to come.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_viii\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_viii.html[1/19/2011 3:45:26 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_ix\n\n< previous page\n\npage_ix\n\nnext page > Page ix\n\nFinancial support toward the revision of the manuscript in 1997 was provided by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Education as part of a project titled \"Interdisciplinary Study on the Origins of Japanese Peoples and Cultures\" headed by Professor Omoto Keiichi.

Five hundred years previously, Hiraizumi had been the capital of the powerful Northern Fujiwara clan and one of the largest cities in Japan, but now its former splendor had gone, overgrown by the summer grass of Basho's* famous poem. The impermanence of existence is a central theme in Basho's work. Yet within that impermanence there is also continuity, symbolized by the material traces of the past, the atothe ruins or sites of history. Earlier in his journey, Basho had come across an ancient inscribed stele at Taga castle, leading him to reflect on its historical significance: \"Time passes and the world changes. The remains of the past are shrouded in uncertainty. And yet, here before my eyes was a monument which none would deny had lasted a thousand years. I felt as if I were looking into the minds of the men of old . . . I forgot the weariness of my journey, and was moved to tears for my joy\" (Keene 1955, 366). Basho's choice of ato was itself derived from the medieval Japanese tradition of travel diaries, wherein the significance of a place was determined by its historyits location in time, rather than by geography. In other words, consciousness of a place was brought forth by antecedence\n\n< previous page\n\npage_1\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_1.html[1/19/2011 3:45:27 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_2\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nnext page > Page 2\n\n(Plutschow 1981, 22), lending in turn a sense of continuity to historical change. Basho's * writings exemplify a number of themes dealt with in this book. In trying to grapple with the problems of ethnicity and ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands, I am constantly confronted with the relationship between permanence and impermanence, continuity and change, reality and dreams. In adopting a primarily archaeological framework, I am particularly faced with the problem of Basho's ato, the physical sites and artifacts of history and how they relate to human identities. At times, all seems like a dream. As Oscar Wilde remarked, \"The actual people who live in Japan are not unlike the general run of English people; that is to say, they are extremely common-place, and have nothing curious or extraordinary about them. In fact the whole of Japan is a pure invention. There is no such country, there are no such people\" (Wilde 1911, 45). It will be argued here, however, that the imagined identities of the Japanese Islands are to some extent based on antecedence, the remains of the past. Even at Hiraizumi, excavations have uncovered remains of the Northern Fujiwara beneath Basho's summer grass. Like Basho*, I cannot fail to be awed by the sacred sites of Japanese history that have accumulated still further layers of antecedence since the seventeenth century. Perhaps unlike Basho, I feel no need to adhere to all the traditions surrounding these \"ruins of identity\"but whether I shall succeed in breaking those bonds is for others to judge. The focus of this book is the origins of the peoples of Japan. More precisely, the book looks at the processes of ethnogenesisthe formation of ethnic groupsin the Japanese Islands from the early agricultural Yayoi period until the beginning of the Middle Ages. The book begins in Part I with a discussion of previous theories on the formation of the Japanese people. It is argued that nationalistic ideologies have profoundly affected the course of research on this topic. The major assumptions of these ideologies are: (1) the biological, linguistic, and cultural aspects of Japanese identity overlap almost completely with each other; (2) culture and ethnos are closed, bounded units; and (3) Japanese culture is derived from several such units, but there is an essential Japanese psychic unity that permeates these various cultural building blocks right down to the concrete kiso bunka (basic culture) below. These are, of course, quite astonishing assumptions, but they can be found at all levels of Japanese society.1 For example, it is accepted by many people in contemporary Japan that only ethnic Japanese can speak Japanese fluently; foreigners who become highly proficient in the language are usually seen as somehow\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_2.html[1/19/2011 3:45:27 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_3\n\n< previous page\n\npage_3\n\nnext page > Page 3\n\nthreatening exceptions to this rule (Miller 1982, 147). There is a similar widespread assumption that people who do not look Japanese cannot be Japanese citizens (Yoshino 1992, 117 118). While such beliefs are naturally much less common among professional anthropologists than among the general population, their influence is still visible. Sasaki Komei *, one of Japan's leading anthropologists, defines the Japanese as those people \"who speak the Japanese language as their mother tongue, who possess traditional Japanese culture, and who think themselves to be Japanese\" (Sasaki 1991b, 12). Though Sasaki admits this is a \"loose\" definition, in my view it is highly problematical. Today most Ainu, Okinawans, and Korean and Chinese minorities in Japan speak Japanese as their mother tongue, yet few would probably see themselves as embracing \"traditional\" Japanese culture, however that is defined. Many of these minorities may think of themselves as Japanese citizens, yet they are essentially viewed as foreigners by most \"ethnic'' Japanese. Sasaki's definition is essentially little changed from the more obviously nationalistic interpretation of historian Kita Sadakichi, who defined Yamato minzoku (the Japanese race) as \"a general term for the whole populace which has lived in our island country for many years, spoken the same national language (kokugo), possessed the same customs, considered themselves as a single people, and also reverently accepted the unbroken imperial lineage of the emperor\" (Kita 1978, [1929]: 211). After discussing the historical development of these nationalistic views of Japanese ethnogenesis, Part II goes on to present a model for the formation of a Japanese core population in the early agricultural Yayoi period (ca. 400 BCAD 300). The outline of this model can be summarized in a few paragraphs. As its basis, it takes the so-called dual-structure hypothesis of population history now supported by a majority of Japanese anthropologists. According to this model, the Japanese Islands were settled by populations from Southeast Asia and/or south China sometime during the Pleistocene. These peoples were the ancestors of the Jomon* people who occupied the Islands from the beginning of the Holocene until the late first millennium BC. In the Yayoi period there was an influx of Northeast Asian groups who spread rapidly through the Islands, reaching the Tohoku region by the Kofun period. The modern inhabitants of the central islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu derive primarily from these Yayoi immigrants, although the genetic contribution of the indigenous Jomon people is thought to increase with distance from north Kyushuthe original port of entry of the migrants. Aspects of this population model, including the concept of Yayoi immigration, have been debated in the literature for a long time. Over the past few years, however, scholars\n\n< previous page\n\npage_3\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_3.html[1/19/2011 3:45:28 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_4\n\n< previous page\n\npage_4\n\nnext page > Page 4\n\nhave arrived at a remarkable consensus that large-scale immigration really did occur in the Yayoi. This consensus is based on a wide range of new cranial, dental, and genetic studies that are summarized in chapter 3. From the starting point of this hypothesis that large-scale immigration into western Japan occurred in the Yayoi, I go on to consider the linguistic and cultural aspects of that population movement. I argue that both the linguistic and the archaeological records support the two-stage biological scheme. My approach to the linguistic side is twopronged. First, several archaeologists have recently tried to develop explicit theories for the relationship between language dispersals and human populations. Bellwood (1991, 1993a, 1993b, 1994), Renfrew (1987, 1989, 1991, 1992a, 1992b) and others have argued, I believe convincingly, that following initial human dispersal in the Pleistocene, colonization resulting from agricultural expansion was the major factor in the spread of the world's languages before AD 1500. Theoretically, therefore, initial dispersal in the Pleistocene and agricultural expansion in the Holocene should be able to explain the distribution of most languages in prehistory, at least in agricultural latitudes. With these theoretical expectations in mind, my next step is to look at the language patterning of the Japanese Islands. The presence of only three languages in the archipelagoJapanese, Ryukyuan, and Ainusuggests that language replacement has occurred at some quite recent time in the past. If such replacement had not happened, then we would expect the language(s) of the initial Pleistocene settlers of Japan to have split into hundreds of surviving local languages. Linguists agree that modern Japanese and Ryukyuan are derived from a single parent language (Proto-Japanese) that existed sometime before the texts of the eighth century AD. Various linguistic estimates, including those from glottochronology, suggest that Proto-Japanese was spoken in or around the time of the Yayoi. It thus seems highly parsimonious to link the spread of the Japanese language through the Islands with agricultural colonization in the Yayoi. For reasons discussed in chapter 4, I argue that Ainu may be derived from a Jomon * language. While it is important to bear in mind that the transition from Jomon to Yayoi was a complex phenomenon that cannot be explained solely by migration, chapter 5 and chapter 6 argue that the archaeological record of the transition contains evidence of immigration from the Korean Peninsula, of population expansion within the Japanese Islands, and of hybridization with indigenous Jomon peoples. The identification of population movements in prehistory is one of the hardest tasks faced by the archaeologist. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the Yayoi case, I make use of comparative\n\n< previous page\n\npage_4\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_4.html[1/19/2011 3:45:28 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_5\n\n< previous page\n\npage_5\n\nnext page > Page 5\n\nanalyses of migration in the Pacific, northeastern America, and Anglo-Saxon England. I believe this comparative approach to be invaluable in assessing the inevitable obscurities of the archaeological record and in judging the relationships between the biological, linguistic, and cultural data. In Part III of the book, the emphasis shifts toward the cultural construction of ethnicity out of the basic core population that was established in the Yayoi. I argue that the cultural aspects of ethnicity should be seen as cumulative negotiation rather than as something \"born\" in a pristine, fully formed state. Such a view necessitates an approach to culture change that takes into account complex interactions within the larger system. Part III, therefore, adopts a world-systems approach to the problem of post-Yayoi ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands. While world-systems theory has been widely used by archaeologists in recent years, many theoretical problems with it remain, not the least of which is the question of how it may be applied to understanding ethnogenesis. The starting point for the model developed here is Hechter's (1975) internal colonialism theory, whereby ethnic differentiation is attributed to uneven economic and political interactions between core and periphery rather than to the social isolation of the periphery. The Ainu, who form the subject of chapter 8, provide an excellent example of the approach used in Part III. For a long time, the Ainu have been seen as pristine primitives and hunter-gatherers. As recently as 1993, Umehara wrote, \"thinking I wanted to know the essence of Jomon * culture, I naturally couldn't help but pay attention to Ainu culture because the Ainu are a people who have lived in the Japanese archipelago and maintained a huntergatherer culture from a timeless past right until recently\" (Umehara 1993, i). Similar comments are common in the literature. Watanabe Hitoshi, the late doyen of Ainu ethnography, concludes that \"it seems quite reasonable to state that until 1867, the Japanese had relatively little effect upon the life of the Ainu\" after himself describing the encroachment of Japanese trading posts in Hokkaido from the sixteenth century and the virtual enslavement of some Ainu in basho (fishing stations) in the early nineteenth century (Watanabe 1972a, 451). In contrast to such statements, chapter 8 argues that the very defining elements of the Ainu period and culture (which began around AD 1200) can be linked with a dramatic increase in Japanese trade goods flowing north as Hokkaido was exploited more and more by core regions to the south. Biologically, and probably linguistically, the Ainu appear to be descended from a Jomon core population, but culturally we can distinguish a transition to the pattern of Ainu culture known ethnographically at the end of the Satsumon era around 1200. In others words, around 1200 the Jomon*/Ainu core population\n\n< previous page\n\npage_5\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_5.html[1/19/2011 3:45:29 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_6\n\n< previous page\n\npage_6\n\nnext page > Page 6\n\nreformed itself for the first time into an etic ethnos that can be termed culturally Ainu. Perilous Ideas: Japan, Ethnicity, Ethnogenesis An outline of the arguments regarding Japanese ethnogenesis made in this book has been presented above, but so far the terms \"Japanese\" and \"ethnogenesis\" have not been defined in any rigorous way. Nash (1989, 1) calls \"ethnicity\" and \"ethnic group\" ''among the most complicated, volatile, and emotionally charged words and ideas in the lexicon of social science.\" Together with \"race\" and \"culture\" they are indeed \"perilous ideas\" (Wolf 1994). The term ethnogenesis is equally problematical, implying an almost Biblical creation of ethnic groups that, once formed, remain forever unchanged. Needless to say, in this book ethnogenesis will be used to refer to a process rather than to an event; nevertheless, the concept of ethnogenesis remains plagued by misunderstandings, and we must begin by clarifying my use of this term. Two recent papers by anthropologist John Moore exemplify current difficulties with the concept of ethnogenesis. Central to the whole debate is the relationship between the biological, linguistic, and cultural components of human communities. Earlier anthropology assumed that these components overlapped, archaeologists proposing that the distribution of material remains such as pottery and axes could be directly linked with past peoples. Despite a long critical tradition (e.g. Boas 1940; Leach 1954; Mongait 1968; Trigger 1968), this set of assumptions has proven remarkably persistent, not least in Japan, where it still underlies most research on Japanese origins. However, the fact that the coevolution of human biology, language, and culture can be disproved on empirical grounds means that the study of ethnic history becomes enormously complex. Moore argues that there are two types of theories that account for the historical formation of ethnic groups: cladistic and rhizotic. Cladistic theory uses the classic family-tree model of divergence to \"emphasize the significance of a historical process by which daughter populations, languages or cultures are derived from a parent group\" whereas rhizotic theory uses a \"river channel\" model to \"emphasize the extent to which each human language, culture, or population is considered to be derived from . . . several different antecedent groups\" (Moore 1994b, 925). Moore himself favors the rhizotic model, arguing that the term ethnogenesis should be limited to this approach. Moore suggests not only that most recent synthetic studies that attempt to link biology, language, and culture in prehistory rely on cladistic taxono\n\n< previous page\n\npage_6\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_6.html[1/19/2011 3:45:29 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_7\n\n< previous page\n\npage_7\n\nnext page > Page 7\n\nmies, but that \"Such attempts require the premise, usually implicit, that human societies have always been bounded or discrete to some extent, so that each society's language, physical type, and culture have coevolved\" (Moore 1994b, 925). Moore (1994a, 14 15) notes that in some situations a cladistic model may be used effectively, but his otherwise polemical binary division is contradictory and too simplistic. In reality, cladistic and rhizotic processes are both at work in any given population. To give a linguistic example, the English language is derived from an earlier Germanic subgroup, a genetic relationship that is best illustrated using a cladistic model; at the same time, however, a rhizotic model would be more appropriate to diagram the influence of borrowing from Norman French. Similarly, ethnic groups as a whole undergo processes of both divergence and integration (Bromley 1983, 11 12; Horowitz 1975, 115). The European colonization of Australia, for instance, can be seen as, on the one hand, the process of divergence from parent European societies, and, at the same time, of integration into a new ethnic identity (Table 1.1).

Source: Horowitz (1975, 116). That Moore has not understood these basic processes is implied by his contrast between linguistic differentiation due to \"slow cladistic\" rather than \"dramatic ethnogenetic\" developments (Moore 1994a, 18). Nothing in cladistics says that change has to be slow. Linguistic change is, of course, the result of human behavior, but both cladistic and rhizotic models of linguistic relationships diagram the history of languages rather than the underlying\n\n< previous page\n\npage_7\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_7.html[1/19/2011 3:45:29 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_8\n\n< previous page\n\npage_8\n\nnext page > Page 8\n\nbehavior. The task facing the anthropologist is that of how to relate the history of biological, linguistic, and cultural relationships to past human behavior. As noted, Moore reserves the term ethnogenesis for his favored rhizotic approach. Since I argue that rhizotic taxonomies are not better but are rather simply different models of the past, I cannot accept this usage, and consequently in this book ethnogenesis refers to the process of ethnic formation in its broad sense. A more precise definition is hindered by debate over the meaning of the term \"ethnic group\" or ethnos (plural ethnoi). Within Western social science, reaction to earlier views of the coevolution of biology, language, and culture has led to a recent shift toward emic rather than etic categorization, toward \"identification itself rather than the content of identity\" (Friedman 1994, 174). This change in emphasis is reflected by the neologism \"ethnicity,\" which began attaining popularity only in the 1960s but which is now a central theme of social science research. Unlike earlier concepts such as those of \"race\" and \"tribe,\" an ethnicity is held to be determined much more by the belief in a common heritage than in actual lines of descent. An ethnos can thus be defined as ''a collectivity within a larger society having real or putative common ancestry, memories of a shared historical past, and a cultural focus on one or more symbolic elements defined as the epitome of their peoplehood\" (Schermerhorn 1970, 12). Theoretically, ethnic community in a shared historical descent can exist without actual genetic continuity. In such cases the presence or absence of population continuity is irrelevant, since ethnicities \"are constituted, not by lines of physical descent, but by the sense of continuity, shared memory and collective destiny, i.e. by lines of cultural affinity embodied in distinctive myths, memories, symbols and values retained by a given cultural unit of population\" (Smith 1991, 29). This approach to ethnicity leads to all sorts of problems for the study of ethnogenesis. To begin with, it is clear that prehistoric emic identities are completely beyond reach. Even premodern societies lack sufficient documentary records to enable us to reconstruct ethnic self-identitiesexcept perhaps for a very limited sector of society. Moore (1994b, 939) writes that, \"The basic problem for all of us, cladists or ethnogeneticists, is determining the relationship between Ethnos A, observed somewhere in time and space, and Ethnos B, observed perhaps at a different location and later in time.\" If an ethnos is defined as an emic collectivity, however, we have no way of even identifying such units outside the ethnographic record. Moore himself ignores this problem, barely pausing to define the ethnos as \"an idealized (and perhaps nonexistent) unit of human society, the irreducible social spe\n\n< previous page\n\npage_8\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_8.html[1/19/2011 3:45:30 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_9\n\n< previous page\n\npage_9\n\nnext page > Page 9\n\ncies\" (Moore 1994a, 13). It seems to me that the only way to resolve this dilemma is to somehow incorporate the objective, etic elementswhat Nash (1989, 5) calls the \"building blocks\"of ethnicity into our analysis. There are several theoretical reasons accounting for the necessity of a shift away from a predominantly emic view of ethnicity. First, an emic perspective is unable to explain the historical causes behind the formation of ethnic groups. Typically, ethnicity is seen either as resulting from a priori, \"primordial\" attachments or else is reduced to the false ideology of \"instrumentalism\" (cf. McKay 1982; Yoshino 1992, 70 74). Bentley (1987) has tried to explain ethnic identity through Bourdieu's concept of the habitus, but as Shennan (1989, 16) notes, \"having provided a basis for the generation of ethnic sentiment, Bentley still has to deal with the question of why and how an ethnic sentiment comes into existence.\" The answer, as Shennan (1989, 16) realizes, is a historical perspective, but most discussions of ethnicity in recent Euro-American anthropology ignore this historical aspect and concentrate on the synchronic construction of identity in relation to other groups. The irony here is that anthropologists and historians recognize the importance of history in legitimizing the ethnos (e.g. Alonso 1988; Foster 1991, 240 242; Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983) and archaeology, with its apparently scientific basis, has a particularly central role to play in such imaginings (e.g. Dietler 1994; Edwards 1991; Anderson 1991, 178 184; Fawcett 1996). An historical dimension to the study of ethnogenesis was central to Soviet anthropology (Libby 1962; Dragadze 1980; Petrova-Averkieva 1980). 2 In the Soviet tradition, emic self-awareness was important, but it was not the central defining feature of an ethnos. Instead, the ethnos was thought to possess a nucleus of a stable common culture that reproduced itself through endogamy in the sense of preferential marriage within a community (Bromley 1974a). Although the long tradition of Soviet and Russian research on ethnicity and ethnogenesis has much to recommend it, the whole idea of the common culture of an ethnos remains rather vague and depends upon a priori assumptions about its stability. Bromley (1974b, 66), for example, writes that \"no ethnos is either eternal or immutable, but this does not contradict the fact that stability is a characteristic feature of [an] ethnos . . .\" In reality, of course, the stability or otherwise of an ethnos is one of the very variables that we hope to discover.1 As we are all too aware these days, a group's perceived identity is often of great significance and may even be sufficient cause for genocide. Nevertheless, ethnicity probably always involves some objective elements. The Jewish nationalist Ahad Ha'am (1856 1927) claimed that national identity\n\n< previous page\n\npage_9\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_9.html[1/19/2011 3:45:30 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_10\n\n< previous page\n\npage_10\n\nnext page > Page 10\n\ndepends \"on no external or objective actuality. If I feel the spirit of Jewish nationality in my heart so that it stamps all my inward life with its seal, then the spirit of Jewish nationality exists in me; and its existence is not at an end even if all my Jewish contemporaries should cease to feel it in their hearts\" (cited in Kedourie 1960, 81). Of course, anyone can convert to Judaism as a religion, and the example may not be a good one; nevertheless a white AngloSaxon or a black American cannot currently become fully Japanese or Korean however much he or she might identify with those groups. In other words, the subjective elements of ethnicity are mediated, to a degree that is itself culturally determined, by reference to more objective biological, linguistic, and cultural markers. As mentioned, with the shift of focus to the practice rather than the content of ethnicity, there have been calls to study the social processes of the construction and naming of ethnic groups. Johnson (1994) does this effectively for modern Taiwan, discussing Taiwanese nationalism as a fiction, an impossible contradiction between claims of an ancient autochthonous community and the reality of a particular political origin in the late 1940s. Yet the construction of Taiwanese identity only becomes a possible focus of research because the recent history of that island is well known. To take another example (discussed in more detail in Part III), the Northern Fujiwara appear to have identified themselves with the Emishi \"barbarians\" of eastern Japan rather than with the ethnic Japanese, but research on the mummified remains of the family has shown that a Kyoto Japanese origin is probable. The point is not whether the Northern Fujiwara were or were not Japanese, but rather that the practice of ethnicity only makes sense in terms of social action. In this case, for example, an Emishi self-identification may have been used to oppose Japanese power. In analyzing the relationship between image and reality, many recent scholars have concentrated on the construction of the former, but such analysis is not possible without a detailed knowledge of the underlying reality. A final reason for my belief that we should move away from a strictly emic view of ethnicity relates to the contemporary political usages of identity. Friedman (1994, 174) writes that \"One cannot make headway in ethnic conflict by trying to convince the adversaries that the contents of their identities are quite mixed up.\" This is rather like the debate over the historicity of the Holocaust: in the end some people will believe what they want to regardless of the factsbut that should not stop the study and broadcast of those facts. A long-term, etic view of ethnicity, with its inescapable conclusion that ethnic groups change quite profoundly over time, is surely the most effective\n\n< previous page\n\npage_10\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_10.html[1/19/2011 3:45:31 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_11\n\n< previous page\n\npage_11\n\nnext page > Page 11\n\ntheoretical deconstruction of ethnic factionalism that there is. Furthermore, the emic ethnicities of powerful nations can easily become hegemonic ideologies when applied to their weaker neighbors. The current Japanese assumption that the Ainu and their prehistoric Jomon * ancestors are ethnically Japanese (discussed in Part I) is an excellent example. At present there is a conceptual break between Jomon and Ainu. This break is well illustrated in the display of the Historical Museum of Hokkaido in Sapporo, where the Ainu exhibit appears suddenly, without clear precedent, in the stone tools and pottery of the previous display cases. If the Ainu were linked to the Jomonone of the most affluent foraging societies known to prehistorythen contemporary views of their status would be transformed. Because the Ainu are a small, disadvantaged minority, however, their emic protestations that they are not Japanese fall largely on deaf ears. Selective and selected memories are a sine qua non of modern nationalism, making the historian's task of remembrance more essential than ever. Core Populations and Ethnoi Rather than concentrating on ethnicity in terms of its now-common use to mean a self-identity, therefore, much of this book will focus on the formation and development of core biological and linguistic populations. Several explanatory points need to be made in this respect. The population concept is used in the human sciences in a number of ways, ranging from the purely arbitrary to the strictly genetic and ecological. In most cases, however, such populations involve a hierarchical classification. For example, genetic, or Mendelian, populations are defined by the extent to which individuals share common genes, but within this general definition there exists a hierarchy of populations ranging from the nuclear family to the human species as a whole (Harrison and Boyce 1972, 3). The same sort of hierarchy also exists for social or ethnic groups, with age, class, gender, and occupation serving as some of the subsets (e.g. Barth 1984). There is no question, therefore, of there ever having been a single, homogeneous Japanese or Jomon population. The concept of a \"Japanese population\" is used heuristically to refer to a hierarchy of groups that were the biological, linguistic, and cultural ancestors of the modern Japanese in a way that the Jomon and Palaeolithic inhabitants of the Islands were not. A summary of the three levels of ethnicity discussed in this book is shown in Table 1.2. In using the concept of \"core populations\" I am not arguing for any sort of biological reductionism. The concept is simply a practical, preliminary\n\n< previous page\n\npage_11\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_11.html[1/19/2011 3:45:31 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_12\n\n< previous page\n\npage_12\n\nnext page > Page 12\n\nTABLE 1.2. A THREE-TIERED HIERARCHY OF ETHNIC CONCEPTS JAPANESE THEORETICAL CONCEPTS AINU CORE POPULATION (Biological and Jomon Japanese-speaking Yayoi population immigrants (some Jomon * often linguistic continuity) (Proto-Ainu intermarriage) and other languagues) Ainu culture Japanese cultures (regional ETIC ETHNOS (Cultural patterns: (from ca. and temporal variations on punctuated evoluation within the 1200) basis of agrarian civilization world-system; in prehistory usually conforms to an archaeological culture) in the Chinese sphere) \"Original Palaeolithic EMIC ETHNOS (\"Imagined\" self\"Indigenous inhabitants of the Islands\" identity) people of Hokkaido\" step toward a fuller analysis of ethnogenesis. It will be argued that the more \"objective\" aspects of ethnic identity are part of the same overall phenomenon as are the subjective, socially constructed ones. For want of a better term, I call this phenomenon \"ethnicity,\" but I am not suggesting that these aspects must necessarily overlap. Rather, since ethnicity is always undergoing processes of negotiation and reconstruction, I argue that both approaches are important. Even though there is a basic biological and linguistic continuity, for example, the emic ethnicity of a fifth-century Saxon, an Elizabethan Englishman, and a Briton in the 1990s would be quite different. Williams (1985) makes this point effectively for Wales, discussing the various types of historical Welshness. In both the English and Welsh cases there is a core of biological and linguistic continuity, although these have also been subject to quite major modifications, for instance through Viking and Norman settlement. The medieval incursions of Vikings and Normans are arguably not perceived as significant to contemporary English ethnicity, but we cannot understand the historical formation of English identity without taking those incursions into account. While establishing the concept of core populations may be a useful preliminary step, at some stage we need to consider the question of how a certain core population may relate to an ethnos as it is usually defined. The levels of ethnicity shown in Table 1.2 must be perceived as shifting sets rather than as fixed types. Within the framework, the individual constructs identities\n\n< previous page\n\npage_12\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_12.html[1/19/2011 3:45:32 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_13\n\n< previous page\n\npage_13\n\nnext page > Page 13\n\nthrough contextual reference to each level. The analogy of a painting may be useful here: if the landscape being painted corresponds to the \"core population,\" then the emotions and perceptions of the painter are the emic ethnicity and the style of the finished work the etic ethnicity. The major problem with this analogy, of course, is that in reality emic ethnicity occurs at a group rather thanor as well asan individual level. That is, an emic ethnos is an imagined community in Anderson's (1991, 6) sense of the term. In the last chapter of this book I attempt a few speculations regarding the possible nature of Japanese emic ethnicity in the premodern era. I conclude that the core population here termed \"Japanese\" almost certainly did not see itself as a single ethnos until the twentieth century, and furthermore that it is impossible to assign any distinctive cultural criteria that might give a unity to this population throughout the whole of its history. This book thus takes the basic stance that, although the historical context of a particular culture is important, no society has an immutable cultural essence. Instead, ethnicity (both etic and emic) is discussed here in terms of cumulative definition through interaction. Ethnic identity is continually recreated through interaction within and without the society concerned. In other words, I focus on sociocultural processes between rather than simply within ethnic groups, on complex ethnic formations in a multiethnic society rather than on isolated \"tribes\" (cf. Cohen 1978, 383 384). As Lockwood (1984, 4) writes, \"Ethnicity is peoples in contact. No ethnic group, by definition, can exist in isolation.\" This is hardly a new ideain fact it can be said to mark the central difference between studies of ethnicity before and after Barth's (1969) path-breaking work (Lockwood 1984, 1). Rather than focusing on bilateral relations between two groups, however, I extend this approach to consider ethnogenesis within the larger world-system, looking at the role of interaction between core and periphery in the formation of new ethnic identities.G The approach to ethnicity espoused here differs quite fundamentally from that used in most Japanese scholarship and popular discourse. As noted above, many Japanese people continue to believe themselves to be an essentially unchanging, bounded unit, with near total overlap between biological population, language, culture, nation, and ethnos. In other words, and here the Japanese differ from many Third-World scholars who see the tribal concept as a colonial imposition, the Japanese have tended to exalt a view of their culture that emphasizes those features listed in the tribal column in Table 1.3. Although the role of outside influences in the origins of the Japanese is widely accepted, the idea that, once formed, the Japanese were an isolated, bounded, and traditional nation is widespread. While acknowledging it as a norm that\n\n< previous page\n\npage_13\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_13.html[1/19/2011 3:45:32 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_14\n\n< previous page\n\npage_14\n\nnext page > Page 14\n\nTABLE 1.3.

Rather than referring merely to an isolated ethnos however, the Japanese tribe takes on the more specialized meaning of the word in its Middle Eastern context, that is, as a large, bounded political community based on descent from a common ancestor (cf. Crone 1986, 51; 1993, 356). Of course, I am not suggesting that the Japanese were really organized along the lines of Middle Eastern tribes, but rather that the tribal metaphor best encapsulates a certain view of an unambiguous nation of people related by blood to the emperor, who was in turn descended from the gods through the first emperor Jimmu. The various forms of this tribal view of Japaneseness are discussed at some length in Part I. The Japanese and the Jomon The major focus of this book is the formation of a Japanese core population in the Yayoi period and the influence of that population on other ethnic groups in the Japanese Islands. It is argued that, as a result of basic biological and linguistic continuities, \"Japanese\" is the most appropriate designation for the core population formed in the Yayoi. This use of \"Japanese\" is similar to the use of \"English\" in the example given above. Today both English and Japanese are controversial terms when applied to all the inhabitants of Britain and of Japan, respectively. Although they are all citizens of the modern Japanese nation-state, the Ainu and the Okinawans, like the Welsh, the Irish, and the Scots in Britain, differentiate themselves ethnically from the so-called\n\n< previous page\n\npage_14\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_14.html[1/19/2011 3:45:33 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_15\n\n< previous page\n\npage_15\n\nnext page > Page 15\n\nmainland Japanese (Wajin). 3 Just as the term English can be used to refer to a specific ethnic group in the past, that is, the Anglo-Saxon invaders of the British Isles, however, so too is Japanese used here to refer to a specific population that spoke an earlier form of the Japanese language and is biologically closely related to the present mainland Japanese. Of course, both English and Japanese are really only convenient labels with which to refer to what were internally heterogenous and changing groups. Nevertheless, these terms can be assigned a certain historical utility. The word \"Japan\" and its European variants are derived from Marco Polo's corruption of a Southern Chinese pronunciation of the characters that are now read Nihon or Nippon in Japanese (Miller 1967, 11). These characters were first used by the rulers of the Yamato state in the late seventh century AD, but there is controversy over their meaning and pronunciation in antiquity (Amino 1992a, 124 132). Perhaps the most likely scenario is that (meaning \"sun root\") was adopted by the Yamato state to replace the earlier characters , which were felt to be unflattering. At first, like was probably read as \"Yamato,\" although by the Heian era the SinoJapanese reading Nihon was also common. However it was read, the name does not seem to have become a fixed or widely accepted term outside the Japanese court until at least the medieval era. As late as the fourteenth century, for example, raiders from the Japanese Islands were called Wako* (Wa pirates) using the old name Wa instead of Nihon: Neither the people of the Korean Peninsula nor the Koryo* government, the Chinese people nor the Ming government called the Wako \"Nihon pirates.\" Six or seven hundred years after the court of the Yamato/Ritsuryo* state had established the name \"Nihon\" and used it in diplomatic relations, the people of medieval East Asia called the attacking Japanese pirates, \"Wa pirates\" (Kadowaki 1992, 1). Traditional views of what is commonly known as Japan have emphasized a homogenous nation centered around a unified Japanese state. The concept of the Japanese people has become almost inseparable from the political state of Japan. This (mis)use of the term \"Japan\" has served to mask the ethnic and cultural diversity of the premodern Islands and to legitimize the ideology of the emperor. A number of Japanese scholars, most eloquently Amino Yoshihiko, now argue that Japan should only be used to refer to the state of that nameor should even be rejected entirely (see Amino 1992a, 132). Amino's comments gain extra pertinence in the light of a recent trend toward using\n\n< previous page\n\npage_15\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_15.html[1/19/2011 3:45:33 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_16\n\n< previous page\n\npage_16\n\nnext page > Page 16\n\nJapan and Japanese in a more inclusive sense than ever before. As discussed in Part I, until the 1930s Japanese anthropologists differentiated strictly between Japanese and non-Japanese peoples and cultures in the Islands. In reaction to the then-dominant imperialist view of Japanese history, however, Yamanouchi Sugao and other archaeologists made a conscious break from such ethnic interpretations of prehistory. After World War II, it became common to use the term Japanese to mean all the inhabitants of the Islands, past and present. In his 1951 book Nihon Minzoku no Keisei (The Formation of the Japanese People), Toma * Seita takes the basic approach that \"The Japanese have inhabited this Japanese archipelago from the beginning\" (Toma 1951, 1). Historian Inoue Kiyoshi (1963, 1) writes, \"From as far back in our history as it is possible to go through until the present, we Japanese have lived as the same race (shuzoku) in the same regionthe present Japanese archipelago.\" The influence of this view in contemporary Japan is shown by Bornoff's (1991, 25) description of a small boy's visit to the 1988 Tokyo National Science Museum exhibition on Japanese origins: \"Although we are Jomon* people,\" [the boy] read aloud from a notice flanking the exhibit, \"we can speak Japanese.\" When [one of the female attendants pretending to be a Jomonette*] congratulated him effusively on his reading abilities, the little boy cried out \"Yappari, Nihonjin-da!\" with a mixture of surprise and relief: \"I thought soshe's Japanese!\" The thought that Jomon people might have been otherwise, even to a small boy, is disturbing. The antiscientific tautology inherent in this use of \"Japanese\" seems lost on most users. Sahara (1993, 48), for instance, includes a footnote in a general history of Japan to explain that the term Japanese means a specific ethnic group with a shared culture and language, but that in his chapter Japanese will simply be used to mean the ancient humans who lived in the Islands. The implication, from this one of Japan's leading archaeologists, is that these definitions amount to the same thing. My use of the word \"Japanese\" in this book avoids both the exclusive and the inclusive trends of the recent literature. The inclusive approach of Sahara and others hides the ethnic diversity and conflict that is an important part of the history of the Islands. As employed by Sahara, the term seems to be more liberal than the meaning implied by its traditional use; however, because it incorporates the primitive Other into the Japanese Self, it is one of the best indicators of the success of the agricultural mainland Japanese who,\n\n< previous page\n\npage_16\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_16.html[1/19/2011 3:45:34 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_17\n\n< previous page\n\npage_17\n\nnext page > Page 17\n\nhaving almost totally replaced the biological, linguistic, and cultural identities of the other Islanders, have now begun to incorporate them into a monolithic history to an extent never before achieved. The exclusivist position of Amino, on the other hand, places too much emphasis on the ideologies of Nihon by linking the Japanese people to the Japanese state (see also Kikuchi 1994, 33 34). In Amino's writings, \"Japan\" is rejected because of its powerful connotations, but, while the Japanese state (i.e., Nihon) did not exist before about AD 700, the people who formed that state did. In this book the Japanese are defined as the population that was formed in the Yayoi period through the immigration of Peninsular farmers and their subsequent mixing with indigenous Jomon * people. The contribution of the Jomon people to the Japanese varied by region, but in much of the western archipelago was probably less than one quarter (see chapter 3). It is important to stress that over much of the past 2,000 years this Japanese population has probably not seen itself as a single ethnic group (see chapter 9). Even as regards biology and language, I am not suggesting that the Japanese were ever completely differentiated from their neighbors or that the biological and linguistic criteria coincide completely. As well as genetic influence from the Jomon people on the Yayoi/Japanese core population, some linguistic borrowing from the Jomon languages cannot be ruled out. The cultural manifestations of the Japanese are irrelevant to the definition of that population used here. The association of the Japanese with rice has long been a potent one. In his Kokyo* Nanajunen*, folklorist Yanagita Kunio (1875 1962) writes, \"I am convinced that the Japanese are a people indivisible from that thing called rice\" (cited in Sasaki 1993, 225). By my definition, they would still be Japanese even if they had subsisted entirely on pineapples and pistachio nuts. Of course, rice cultivation and other aspects of Japanese culture have influenced the ways in which the Japanese people view their identity and, in turn, the ways in which they are viewed by others. These cultural traits, however, have always been in a process of flux and negotiation, and to define the Japanese by such traits is a form of circular reasoning that only serves to support the myths of Japanese uniqueness. There is, however, one cultural trait that we are justified in including in any definition of the Japanese agriculture. The type of agriculture is irrelevant; what is of primary significance is the presence of an expanding, predatory farming system. The history of the world since the Neolithic has been one of the expansion of farmers at the expense of nonfarming peoples. There are now no hunter-gathering peoples unaffected by farmers, and during the next century the world's few remaining hunter-gatherers may totally disappear.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_17\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_17.html[1/19/2011 3:45:34 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_18\n\n< previous page\n\npage_18\n\nnext page > Page 18\n\nMany of these farmers have, of course, reached an industrial level and live in a world where their influence on nonfarmers has increased phenomenally. For example, Japanese and other companies exploit Southeast Asian rainforests, forcing foragers off their land thousands of kilometers from the companies' home countries. Despite such complexities, however, the basic process of expansion is the same, and in this respect industrial cultures can be considered advanced agricultural ones. The Japanese Islands have been no exception to this worldwide phenomenon. Full-scale food production began in the Islands in the Yayoi period (Hudson 1990a). As well as being the basic cause of the expansion of the Japanese population, agriculture provided the basis for the growth of social complexity that culminated in the Ritsuryo * state of the eighth century AD. This social complexity in turn brought about the conditions for the complex processes of ethnogenesis that occurred in the Islands after the Yayoi. This is not to say, however, that the form of these cultural developments has any sort of inherent link with agriculture. As Gellner (1988, 19) notes, agriculture establishes the essential conditions, but it does not predetermine the forms that culture will take. To some historians of Japan my emphasis on agriculture may seem to contradict the recent stress given to nonagricultural peoples by Amino (1984, 1994, 1995, 1996) and others. Umehara (1991, 163) writes, ''Hitherto, understanding of Japan and Japanese culture has assumed that Japanese culture is unitary and above all based on agriculture.\" But to say that Japanese culture was based above all on agriculture is a truism that should not excuse our ignoring the nonfarming peoples of the Islands. Fishermen, nuns, and actors all lived in an archipelago where food production was the basis of political power and were all part of what was above all an agricultural society. Apart from the Japanese, the other core population discussed in this book is the Jomon*. My use of these terms may appear contradictory: if there is a core of biological and linguistic continuity between Jomon and Ainu, should not the Jomon people be designated as an \"Ainu population\"? In view of the biological evidence for Jomon-Ainu* affinity discussed in chapter 3, it may indeed be appropriate to refer to the Jomon people as Ainu. That this has not yet happened is almost certainly due more to the ideological factors discussed in Part I than to any scientific reasons. There are several problems, however, with a too-hasty Jomon=Ainu identification. To begin with, Hokkaido was essentially prehistoric until the nineteenth century, and the exact degree of continuity between, say, the Epi-Jomon* and Satsumon periods relies\n\n< previous page\n\npage_18\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_18.html[1/19/2011 3:45:34 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_19\n\n< previous page\n\npage_19\n\nnext page > Page 19\n\non still-debated archaeological and anthropological interpretations. Second, and more important, we do not know when the hypothetical Jomon */Ainu population was first formed or when the Ainu language was first spoken. For these reasons, it may presently be best to limit the term \"Ainu\" to the period and culture of that name in order to test more synthetic hypotheses about Ainu origins.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_19\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_19.html[1/19/2011 3:45:35 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_21\n\n< previous page\n\npage_21\n\nnext page > Page 21\n\nPART I JAPANESE ETHNICITY: HISTORIES OF A CONCEPT\n\n< previous page\n\npage_21\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_21.html[1/19/2011 3:45:35 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_23\n\n< previous page\n\npage_23\n\nnext page > Page 23\n\n2 Tales Told in a Dream [Arai] Hakuseki set out to demonstrate that the \"deities\" of [the Age of the Gods] were neither divine entities operating outside the scope of the will of heaven nor cosmological or metaphysical elements belonging to the realm of heaven itself.

It is not suggested that Japanese archaeologists and anthropologists as a whole have consciously supported the emperor-centered nationalism of the Japanese state . As a generalization, the opposite is true, but nationalism has always provided a context for debates on prehistory. In particular, a primordialist view of ethnicity, the view that the Japanese Volk was created at a single time in antiquity and has continued to be a bounded and essentially unchanging essence ever since, will be shown to have very deep roots in the Japanese tradition and to have played an important role in debates on ethnogenesis. A three-stage chronological division is a useful way of ordering the material discussed here.

The second stage lasts from 1877 to 1935 and marks a new intensity in the debate over Japanese origins that arose as a result of the influence of the new fields of archaeology and anthropology. Stage 2 was the time of transition between a textual and a truly archaeological approach to the past. Stage 3, which began with the Minerva Debate of 1936 and continues today, is the era of scientific archaeology on an increasingly elaborate scale, but it is also a stage of complex discourse between nationalism and identity. Of these three stages, only the second saw a firm conception of a non-Japanese people inhabiting the Islands before the arrival of the Japanese themselves. For most Japanese scholars of the first and third stages, all ancient inhabitants of the Islands are ethnic Japanese. Before the introduction of archaeology and anthropology, ancient Japanese and Chinese texts were the main source of information about the origins of the Japanese people. The early chapters of the Kojiki (AD 712) and the Nihon Shoki (720) describe the creation of the Islands in the Age of the Gods, followed by the eastward advance of the first human emperor Jimmu from Kyushu into the Kinai region and his subjugation of the primitive tribes he found along the way (cf. Aston 1972, 1: 1 137; Philippi 1968, 47 182). Traditionally, Jimmu's conquest has been seen as marking the beginning of the Japanese people in the Islands. While interpretations of this myth have changed over the centuries, its significance remains unchallenged with, for example, Umehara (1990, 14) arguing that it reflects Yayoi colonization at the expense of the Jomon * people. National Foundation Day, a national holiday celebrated on February 11 to commemorate Jimmu's ascension in 660 BC, was revived by the Japanese government as recently as 1966 (Yoshino 1992, 207). An understanding of the two major philosophical schools of the Tokugawa period (1600 1867) is essential if one is to comprehend Japanese views of their origins and of antiquity during Stage 1. Confucianism was the first of these schools; the second was the Kokugaku movement. For present purposes, the most important difference between the two schools was the degree of emphasis given to continental influences on Japanese history. Both\n\n< previous page\n\npage_24\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_24.html[1/19/2011 3:45:36 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_25\n\n< previous page\n\npage_25\n\nnext page > Page 25\n\nthe tradition and the actual texts of Chinese historical writing were central to the Confucianist approach, whereas Kokugaku nativists did their best to play down the influence of China on Japanese history. An excellent example of differing Tokugawa approaches to Japanese origins is provided by the debate over Wu Taibo (Brownlee 1988, 41; Kracht 1986, 140 141; Miyazaki 1988, 38 41; Nakai 1980, 188 195; Webb 1958, 20 21). Taibo is mentioned in several early Chinese texts as an ancestor of the Zhou royal lineage who gave up his legitimate rights of succession in deference to his father, who wanted his second son to succeed. The official histories of the Jin and Liang dynasties follow the now lost Wei Lue in noting that the Japanese saw themselves as descendants of Taibo. Similar stories describe the exploits of a son of Shaokang of the legendary Xia dynasty and the Qin Daoist exile Xufu. The Taibo story was openly criticized as early as the fourteenth century by Kitabatake Chikafusa (1293 1354) in his Jinno * Shotoki* (Chronicle of the Direct Descent of Gods and Sovereigns): One Chinese source states: \"The Japanese are descended from . . . [Taibo] . . . of Wu,\" but this assertion has absolutely no basis in fact. It was also claimed in ancient times that the Japanese were of the same stock as the people of Korea . . . After the separation of heaven and earth, [the god] Susanoo-no-mikoto did in fact go to Korea. Hence the assertion that the Korean people are also descended from [the gods] is not really so incredible. Yet however plausible, even this assertion was rejected long ago. Since the Japanese are descendants of the [gods], . . . how could they possibly derive from [Taibo] of Wu, who lived in a much later age (Varley 1980, 104, emphasis added)? However, a hypothetical reconstruction by Confucianist Hayashi Razan (1583 1657) of the views of a medieval monk who had reputedly written a book arguing that Taibo could be identified with the Kojiki/Nihon Shoki god Ninigi-no-mikoto, led to the story becoming a subject of controversy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Nakai 1980, 189). Although he stressed that it was no more than a private opinion, Razan argued that Ninigi and Jimmu may have been derived from Taibo (Tsunoda et al. 1958, 358 360). In his Shokohatsu* (A Blunt Discharge of Words; 1781), To* Teikan (1732 1797) was less circumspect than Razan, proposing that Jimmu was related to Taibo, whose descendants had reached Kyushu from China by way\n\n< previous page\n\npage_25\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_25.html[1/19/2011 3:45:36 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_26\n\n< previous page\n\npage_26\n\nnext page > Page 26\n\nof the Ryukyus. Teikan derived various aspects of Japanese culture from Korea as well as from China and proposed that the date ascribed to the ascension of Jimmu in the Nara texts was 600 years too early and should really be 60 BC (see Hoshino 1980, 18 19; Torii 1926, 60 76). Razan and other Confucianists' use of the Taibo myth can be seen as an attempt to bolster Japanese imperial prestige through an appeal to Confucian values (Nakai 1980, 189 190; Webb 1958, 21). In the Analects, Confucius himself describes Taibo as a paragon of virtue: \"The Master said, Of [Taibo] it may indeed be said that he attained to the very highest pitch of moral power. No less than three times he renounced the sovereignty of all things under Heaven, without the people getting a chance to praise him for it\" (Waley 1938, 132). A number of Confucian scholars, most notably Arai Hakuseki (1657 1725), however, did not accept a Chinese origin for the Japanese people (Miyazaki 1988, 41). Hakuseki specifically rejected the Chinese accounts of Taibo, Shaokang, and Xufu as progenitors of the Japanese imperial family, but in his Koshitsu * Wakumon (1716) he suggests that certain Kyushu chieftains may have been descended from Taibo or Shaokang (Arai 1906, 390). Tokugawa Mitsukuni (1628 1701), patron of the Confucian history the Dai Nihonshi, was astounded by support for the Taibo story. \"What sort of nonsense is this?\" he asked in 1670. \"This is like some foreign book calling the Heavenly (i.e., Japanese) Dynasty an offshoot of the [Zhou] line. This idea comes from a mistaken tradition entirely unworthy of credence\" (Webb 1958, 21). Kokugaku scholars did not look very favorably on the legends of Wu Taibo and the other proposed Chinese \"ancestors,\" either. For nativists such as Moto'ori Norinaga, it was the very fact that the Japanese emperors could boast an unbroken line of descent back to the sun goddess Amaterasu that gave Japan her innate superiority. Norinaga was so outraged by Teikan's Shokohatsu* that he wrote a detailed attack on the book entitled Kenkyo* jin or Silencing a Lunatic (1785) (see Moto'ori 1972, 273 303). The nativist agenda, however, went much further than mere name calling. It aimed at the removal of the Japanese \"from the Other [mainly China] and from both history and culture\" by emphasizing \"those aspects that made all Japanese irreducibly Japanesethe same and thereby different from the Other\" (Harootunian 1988, 409). Even the most superficial knowledge of Japanese history made it clear that Japan's debt to China and Korea was enormous. In denying these influences, the nativists also had to deny the real complexities of Japanese history in order to construct a new, purely ''Japanese\" culture. Though it harkened back to the Age of the Gods before Chinese influences,\n\n< previous page\n\npage_26\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_26.html[1/19/2011 3:45:37 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_27\n\n< previous page\n\npage_27\n\nnext page > Page 27\n\nthis new identity was pure only in the way it was imagined. Norinaga \"often likened the Kojiki to the 'clear mirror' in which the image of the age of [the gods] is reflected. The task to which Norinaga dedicated most of his life was to clarify and disclose the 'image' as it is, by wiping the 'dust' or 'veil' of the 'Chinese spirit' from the 'mirror'\" (Matsumoto 1970, 80). In reality, the nativists saw only their own nostalgic reflection, yet in their remarkably successful construction of Japanese identity they created a powerful, imperialist myth of common descent and superiority. The following passage from the Kodo * Taii (Summary of the Ancient Way) by Hirata Atsutane (1776 1843) leaves no doubt as to the nationalistic appeal of Tokugawa nativism: People all over the world refer to Japan as the Land of the Gods, and call us the descendants of the gods. Indeed, it is exactly as they say: our country, as a special mark of favor from the heavenly gods, was begotten by them, and there is thus so immense a difference between Japan and all the other countries as to defy comparison. Ours is a splendid and blessed country, . . . and we, down to the most humble man and woman, are the descendants of the gods (Tsunoda et al. 1958, 544). Similar ideologies have been used in many parts of the world through history, but few have been as successful as the Japanese \"myth of uniqueness.\" As we shall see later in this chapter, even after the diverse roots of Japanese culture became widely accepted, the idea that a \"pure,\" unitary culture was formed out of those roots remainedand continues to remaina powerful one. European Perspectives Works by early European visitors to Japan reflect various influences on their interpretations of Japanese origins. The Portuguese Jesuit João Rodrigues concluded that Japan was settled by different continental peoples at different times in the past. He argued that in addition to the Chinese and Koreans who settled in the western archipelago, Tartars from \"the Tartar island called Ezo [i.e., Hokkaido]\" settled north Honshu (Cooper 1973, 45), an idea that probably reflected contemporary Japanese beliefs that Ezo was linked to the mainland (cf. Kamiya 1994):\n\nIt is true that the Japanese have been subject to one leader or king above all the rest, with the same language and general customs\n\n< previous page\n\npage_27\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_27.html[1/19/2011 3:45:37 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_28\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nnext page > Page 28\n\nthroughout all the kingdom; nevertheless it is well known to anybody who has seen all of Japan that each region has many special things similar to those parts whence they were peopled, and that there are differences between some regions and others (João Rodrigues, 1561? 1633; Cooper 1973, 46, emphasis added). Although Rodrigues supported the legends of Wu Taibo and Xufu (cf. Cooper 1973, 39 43), German physician Engelbert Kaempfer (1651 1716) argued against a Chinese origin for the Japanese because of what he saw as irreconcilable differences in language, religion, and \"civil customs and way of life\" (Kaempfer 1906, 133 138). Instead, Kaempfer proposed a Babylonian origin: In the first Ages of the World, not long after the Deluge, when the . . . Babylonians [were] dispers'd all over the World, . . . then the Japanese also set out on their Journey . . . after many years travelling, . . . they alighted at this remote part of the World [and] being well pleas'd with its situation and fruitfulness, they resolv'd to chuse it for the place of their abode; . . . consequently they are an original Nation, no ways indebted to the Chinese for their descent and existence . . . (Kaempfer 1906, 151 152). What is interesting here is the way Kaempfer attempted to explain what he saw as the linguistic and cultural uniqueness of the Japanese by deriving them from a single source. That his Christian background led him to propose Babylon as the ultimate origin of the Japanese is perhaps less important than the fact that he saw fit to propose the same sort of primordialist theory of Japanese ethnicity that was espoused by many of his Japanese contemporaries. Kaempfer admitted that \"from time to time new Colonies were sent over [to Japan], chiefly from China and Corea,\" but \"their number must have been very inconsiderable with regard to the bulk of the Japanese Nation\" (1906, 146 147). In other words, despite these minor incursions, in Kaempfer's view the essence of the Japanese people was formed at a specific but undated time in antiquity. Kaempfer (1906, 158) makes the interesting comment that the Japanese \"have . . . little to say concerning the state of their Country, and the history of their ancestors before the time of Sinmu [Jimmu] their first Monarch. For this reason several of their own Writers have ventur'd to call Japan Atarasikoks,\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_28.html[1/19/2011 3:45:38 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_29\n\n< previous page\n\npage_29\n\nnext page > Page 29\n\nand Sinkokf, that is, New Country, as if it had been newly found out and peopled under the reign of their first Emperor.\" Although he simply placed the creation of the Japanese farther back in time, Kaempfer was critical of this native view of history, arguing that \"the Japanese Nation must needs have existed, and liv'd in the Country, a considerable time before their first . . . Emperor, since when he was rais'd to the throne, they were then already grown very numerous\" (Kaempfer 1906, 159). This question of who inhabited the archipelago before Jimmu is a crucial one. Kaempfer believed that the Japanese people had settled the Islands long before Jimmu and had \"led for many ages a wandring life, erring from place to place\" and ''living on their Cattle, on what the earth produced of plants, roots and fruits, and the Sea afforded of fish and crabs\" (1906, 159 and 146). Few Japanese scholars of the Tokugawa period, however, seem to have shared such a prosaic view of their origins, seeing instead an essential continuity from the Age of the Gods through Jimmu into the present era. Yamaga Soko * (1622 1685), a pupil of Razan, wrote \"In Chugoku6pe: [i.e., Japan] alone, although from the time of creation until the first human Emperor, some two million years . . . have elapsed, the Imperial line of the heavenly gods has never changed\" (Earl 1964, 48). Norinaga expressed similar thoughts in a more poetic fashion: Yononaka no aru omobuki wa nanigoto mo kamiyo no ato o tazunete shirayu [\"What ever exists in the world can be understood by tracing it back to the age of the deities\"] (Yoshikawa 1983, 262). Norinaga did not argue that the Japanese were created ex nihilo, but that they developed from kami (the gods) in a smooth process: he saw \"no distinct dividing line between the age of kami and [the] human age\" (Matsumoto 1970, 178). Understandably, a number of Tokugawa scholars found the Age of the Gods rather hard to weave into a historical narrative. Few would have agreed with Asaka Tampaku (1654 1737), who called the Age of the Gods \"farfetched and insignificant\" (cited in Brownlee 1988, 42), but Tokugawa Mitsunori wrote that, \"The matters of the Age of the Gods are all strange, and\n\n< previous page\n\npage_29\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_29.html[1/19/2011 3:45:38 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_30\n\n< previous page\n\npage_30\n\nnext page > Page 30\n\nhard to include in the chronicle of Emperor Jimmu\"; for this reason his Dai Nihonshi \"did not begin with the founding of Japan by the gods, but with the inauguration of imperial rule by Jimmu\" (Brownlee 1988, 42). Arai Hakuseki attempted to place the Age of the Gods into an explicitly historical, Sinocentric view of the past (Nakai 1988, 242 264). He argued that the \"gods were men'' (Arai 1906, 219) and that Takamagahara, the High Plain of Heaven, could be identified with a real place in Hitachi province. Hakuseki saw the submission of the local Yamato chiefs to Jimmu as an example of the transfer of the mandate of power rather than as an ethnic Japanese/barbarian conflict (see Nakai 1988, 242 264). After the ascension of Jimmu, almost all Tokugawa observers agreed on the unbroken line of imperial descent. If a few shadowy barbarians had lived in the Islands before Jimmu, they were of no real significance in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century historical discourse. Indeed, for Confucianists, the presence of barbarians surrounding the central kingdom was the natural order and not something that required detailed explanation. A fundamental shift in this view of ancient Japan occurred in the nineteenth century, when increased Japanese encroachment on the Ainu led to their appropriation as a primitive people who could be associated with barbarians living in Japan before Jimmu. This idea was not a totally new one. The Kamakura-era Soga Monogatari had proposed that the Ezo (Ainu) were descendants of the demon king Abi, who had been banished to Sotogahama (Aomori) by Jimmu (Kikuchi 1994, 48). Medieval perceptions of the impurity of the regions beyond the state boundaries were, however, clearly at work in this predominantly spatial model. The addition of a historical perspective was the crucial development of the nineteenth century. The appropriation of the Ainu into Japanese (pre)history has many facets and requires location in the complex discourses of colonialism and exploration. From early European writers we know that the seventeenth-century metropolitan Japanese knew very little about the native inhabitants of Hokkaido, or Ezo as it was then called (see e.g. Caron and Schouten 1935, 13). Most eighteenth-century Japanese writings on Ezo origins were based primarily on ancient Chinese accounts of northern barbarians. Arai Hakuseki, in his influential Ezo-shi (1720), uses these accounts to argue that the Ezo were \"northern Wa\" and thus basically Japanese (Arai 1906, 681; Miyazaki 1988, 245). Matsumae Hironaga's Matsumae-shi (1781) takes the same basic approach (Matsumae 1979, 102 104). Hayashi Shihei's Sangoku tsuran * Zusetsu (1786) argues that the Ezo were human beings like the Japanese but that they had not yet been civilized like the inhabitants of Japan, China, Korea, and Holland had been (Hayashi 1979, 41).\n\n< previous page\n\npage_30\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_30.html[1/19/2011 3:45:39 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_31\n\n< previous page\n\npage_31\n\nnext page > Page 31\n\nChanging Japanese views of the Ainu were deeply intertwined with Japanese colonial concerns in the north. The potential economic benefits to be gained from the colonization of Hokkaido and the other islands were stressed by several writers, most notably Honda Toshiaki (1744 1821). Yet despite these perceived advantages, and despite the strategic threat from the Russians who had established several small colonies on Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands in the eighteenth century, actual colonization of Hokkaido by the Japanese did not occur until the late nineteenth century. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the proposed common ancestry of the Ainu and Japanese was used to support colonization of the north (Keene 1969, 117; Kikuchi 1994, 227 230). Honda Toshiaki's comment that, \"Since [the Ainu] are all the descendants of the Emperor Jimmu, they are of the same race as ourselves\" (Honda 1935, 209; Keene 1969) echoes the sympathetic attitude to the Ainu held by explorer Mogami Tokunai: \"This year [1784] I encountered many Ainu, and I realized what a great mistake it is to think of them as belonging basically to the species of dogs; in fact, they are of the same Japanese stock as ourselves. They have only to adopt the teachings of the Imperial Land for them to become Japanese\" (quoted in Keene 1969, 134). Keene (1969, 134) suggests that Mogami may have been the first Japanese to believe that the Ainu, though barbarians, were of the same race as the Japanese. As Ezo was argued to be an integral part of Japanese territory, it was natural for its inhabitants to be Japanese. By the nineteenth century, however, as the Japanese came more and more into direct contact with the Ainu, views of the Ezo began to change. In the eyes of the Japanese, the Ainu became more primitive and less Japanese. The old idea that the Ainu were in part descended from a dog gained a new popularity at this time. Lt. S. W. Holland of the Royal Navy found it \"curious that all Japanese books give [this] account of the origin of the Ainos, and all exactly agree\" (Holland 1874, 236, original emphasis). A popular Volksetymologie of the late nineteenth century even derived Ainu from inu (dog), though few Western observers seem to have been convinced by this. What we are in effect seeing in late nineteenth-century Japan is the development of ideas of racial inferiority with respect to the Ainu. Such ideas did not appear in a vacuum: \"the half century or more during which the Japanese initially turned to the West for education coincided almost exactly with the period when scientific racism dominated the natural and social sciences in Europe and the United States\" (Dower 1986, 204). A racist view of the Ainu thus became intertwined with an image of them as the primitive aborigines of the Islands who had been driven north by Jimmu and the (racially superior)\n\n< previous page\n\npage_31\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_31.html[1/19/2011 3:45:39 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_32\n\n< previous page\n\npage_32\n\nnext page > Page 32\n\nJapanese. As noted by Fawcett (1986, 51), in the context of the late-nineteenth century colonization of Hokkaido, this ethnic interpretation of prehistory could be used as justification for continued Japanese expansion at the expense of what were considered non-Yamato peoples. By the time of the Meiji Restoration, therefore, American Albert Bickmore could write that \"the Japanese all believe that [the] aborigines [encountered by Jimmu] were the ancestors of the present Ainos\" (Bickmore 1868, 359 360). Little more than a decade earlier, Klaproth had been less sure of the connection, proposing only that the aborigines \"resembled\" the Ainu: ce pays, originairement habité par des autochthones, a été civilisé par des colonies chinoises, arrivées à différentes époques dans les provinces occidentales du Japon. On verra plus bas que le théâtre de l'histoire mythologique qui précède l'époque de Zin mou ten o [emperor Jinmu], est placé dans le Fiougo, province de l'île de Kiouziou [Kyushu], qui est la plus occidentale du Japon, et que ce conquérant partit de là pour aller soumettre la partie orientale de cet empire, habitée par un peuple qui ressemblait aux Aïnos du Yéso, du Taraïkaï [Sakhalin], des îles Kouriles et du Kamtchatka (Kalproth 1854, x). It is widely argued that Philipp Franz von Siebold (1796 1866), a German medical doctor stationed at Dejima in the 1820s, was the first to link the Ainu with the aboriginal, pre-Jimmu inhabitants of Japan (e.g. Kreiner 1993, 30). Siebold did indeed propose that an aboriginal, hunter-fisher Ainu population, originating in the north, had been pushed back to Ezo under Japanese expansion (Siebold 1930, 732 734 and 1261), but the question of whether or not this conclusion is original is a difficult one. Certainly, Sieboldwho admitted \"Je n'ai jamais vu des Aïnos\" (1831, 79)was strongly influenced by Japanese writers. He used \"dissertations\" written by his Japanese students in the compilation of his work, Nippon (Vos 1983). In his famous chapter on magatama (comma-shaped jewels), Siebold (1930, 731) quotes a Japanese writer as proposing that the ancient Japanese lived in caves like the contemporary inhabitants of Hokkaido and Sakhalin. The idea of comparing the Ainu with the pre-Jimmu \"Japanese,\" therefore, may have been a borrowed one, but Siebold gave it a scientific basis, arguing that the primitive Islanders had been \"Fischern und Jägern\" and that the material evidence of magatama from both Hokkaido and the Ryukyus supported Japanese expansion through the central islands (Siebold 1930, 729 735).\n\n< previous page\n\npage_32\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_32.html[1/19/2011 3:45:39 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_33\n\n< previous page\n\npage_33\n\nnext page > Page 33\n\nBoth Japanese and Western thinking on Japanese origins on the eve of the first archaeological excavations in Japan are well summarized in an 1876 pamphlet by William Borlase entitled Niphon and its Antiquities. Following Siebold, Borlase derived the Ainu from the north, arguing that they must have occupied all of Honshu before the arrival of Jimmu. Borlase was less certain, however, of the origin of the Japanese \"invaders,\" apparently agreeing with Klaproth that they were autochthonous in Kyushu (Borlase 1876, 35). Again largely through Siebold, Borlase (1876, 25) was aware of the many stone artifacts that had been found in Japan and \"which Japanese authors themselves agree in attributing to the Yebisu [=Emishi/Ezo].\" During the Tokugawa era, a number of scholars had linked the ancient stone points and pottery that were occasionally unearthed in various parts of Japan with the people of Ezo (Bleed 1986, 60 63). Matsuoka Gentatsu (1669 1746) thought the points were carried south by birds that had been shot but not killed by Ezo arrows. Kiuchi Sekitei (1724 1808) argued that, since stone points were common in north and east Japan but rare in the west, the Ainu had preceded the Japanese in the former regions. None of these scholars, nor indeed William Borlase, however, can be said to have possessed what Daniel (1963) termed the \"idea of prehistory,\" that is, the concept of a period before written history that could be investigated using the archaeological record. Kiuchi Sekitei, for example, called the stone artifacts he described \"Things from the Age of the Gods\" even though he knew they were man-made (Bleed 1986, 63). In 1876, in the first Western general history of Japan written in the Meiji era, William Griffis wrote: The evidences of an aboriginal race are still to be found in the relics of the Stone Age in Japan. Flint, arrow and spear heads, hammers, chisels, scrapers, kitchen refuse, and various other trophies, are frequently excavated, or may be found in the museum or in houses of private persons. Though covered with soil for centuries, they seem as though freshly brought from an Aino hut in Yezo (Griffis 1886 [1876], 29, emphasis added). It was in this intellectual atmosphere that on June 20, 1877, American zoologist Edward Morse, having arrived at Yokohama a few days earlier, made his first journey into Tokyo. From his railway carriage, Morse saw shell middens beside the tracks at Omori * and in the autumn of that year conducted Japan's first scientific archaeological excavation.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_33\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_33.html[1/19/2011 3:45:40 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_34\n\n< previous page\n\npage_34\n\nnext page > Page 34\n\nThe period 1877 1935 was pivotal in the study of the origins of the Japanese people. Following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japan transformed herself into an industrial nation-state. Nationalist sentiment, the seeds of which had been present in Stage 1, was no longer limited to the elite but was manipulated to become the ideological basis of the Meiji state. The Western disciplines of archaeology and anthropology were introduced to Japan, and the preexisting trend to see the Ainu as the pre-Japanese aboriginal inhabitants of the Islands was now given a \"scientific\" basis and linked with the newly discovered Stone Age (Jomon *) remains and a growing sample of prehistoric skeletons. The first Yayoi pottery was found in 1884, but the concept of a Yayoi culture was not developed until the very end of this stage. The influence of Edward Morse (1838 1925) on Japanese archaeology is undeniable, but his excavation at Omori* did not represent a complete break with previous approaches to the past: Morse stated firmly that the Omori site was \"prehistoric\" and that it must predate the earliest available historical sources . . . A closer look at Morse's work strongly suggests, however, that he did not grasp the significance of \"prehistory\" and could not have led Japanese scholars away from a text-oriented approach . . . In an article in Popular Science Monthly (1879b) Morse described not only his work at Omori but also Japan's mythical history. The early chronicles were not critically evaluated, and written records were apparently presented as the context within which Japanese archaeology should be undertaken and understood (Bleed 1986, 66). Though less well known than Morse, Heinrich Philipp von Siebold (a son of Philipp Franz) excavated as many as seven shell middens in Japan in the late 1870s (Kreiner 1980). Siebold's approach to interpreting the past was similar to Morse's in that he argued that archaeology was a new, scientific way of proving the authenticity of historical records:\n\nJapanese history records that [the \"tribes of savages with whom Jimmu Tenno met when he advanced northwards\"] did not know the use of metals, that they lived in caves, and awaited the attacks of the Japanese on the heights of the mountains. But even if we do not believe in these old historical records, yet more trustworthy\n\n< previous page\n\npage_34\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_34.html[1/19/2011 3:45:40 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_35\n\n< previous page\n\npage_35\n\nnext page > Page 35\n\nones consist in the implements etc. which they left behind, and [which] give sufficient proof that the earliest inhabitants were none other than the present inhabitants of Yezo (Siebold 1879, ii). During Stage 2, the desire of the Meiji oligarchy to unify Japan in the face of the threat of European colonialism was a crucial stimulus to the new nationalism. A statist nationalism developed in which the state was seen as an organic, natural extension of the Japanese people (Weiner 1995, 444 449). The Japanese state, it came to be believed, was a unique polity centered around an unbroken imperial line that headed a family of subjects. In the 1875 words of Fukuzawa Yukichi, the kokutai (national polity) was the \"grouping together of people of one race\" (quoted in Healey 1983, 263). The attempted erosion of Tokugawa-period class divisions was an important part of the country's modernization, and the general who headed the new conscript army that put down the 1877 revolt by ex-samurai Saigo * Takamori announced his victory by noting that, \"The Japanese, whether of the military class or not, originally sprang from the same blood, and, when subjected to regular discipline, could scarcely fail to make soldiers worthy of the renowned bravery of their ancestors\" (quoted in Crump 1991, 68, emphasis added). In this nationalistic climate, the \"superiority of the Japanese people was naturally emphasized and the identification of the savage Stone Age producers of the pottery and lithics found in shell middens as the ancestors of the Japanese was rejected. Instead, the Stone Age people were regarded as aborigines who were driven out by the settlement of the superior descendants of the gods who formed the ancestors of the Japanese\" (Saito* 1974, 135). Ethnic substitution theories thus provided the main interpretive framework for Japanese prehistory during Stage 2. Though some scholars began to question the historicity of Jimmu (cf. Hoshino 1980, 98 125), the assumption that the Japanese were a separate race of divine origin remained widely accepted. For this reason, the origins of the Japanese never really became a problem at this time (Kudo* 1989b, 56). The real question that occupied anthropological minds was, Who had been in Japan before the Japanese? The Ainu were the main candidates, but so-called pre-Ainu theories also gained wide currency. As noted already, the concept of racial determinism, which was prevalent in both academic and popular circles in Europe and America in the late nineteenth century, had a pervasive influence on early Japanese anthropology. \"Race is the key to history\" announces the title page of W. E. Griffis' 1907 book The Japanese Nation in Evolution. At that time this was no idle motto, and Griffis (1907, 10) could seriously propose that \"Ainu intelligence\n\n< previous page\n\npage_35\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_35.html[1/19/2011 3:45:41 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_36\n\n< previous page\n\npage_36\n\nnext page > Page 36\n\nis limited, but it seems to be of the same kind as our own and not of the Asiatic order.\" Yet Japanese and Western concepts of race were subtly different. Generally speaking, in Japan the biological component of race has been less important than the cultural aspects. The Japanese model of divinely ordained supremacy has carried greater weight than mere skin color. This has enabled the Japanese to avoid confronting their own status in the eyes of Western racists, who overwhelmingly tend to view white skin as superior to all other colors, including yellow. As a result, \"whereas racism in the West was markedly characterized by denigration of others, the Japanese were preoccupied far more exclusively with elevating themselves\" (Dower 1986, 204). The complex discourse in Stage 2 between Japanese concepts of divine superiority based on the traditional texts, Western anthropology and its racial determinism, and the new hard \"facts\" of the archaeological record is well illustrated by the Korpokunkur (or Koropok-guru) theory. The Ainu legend that a race of dwarflike pit dwellers had inhabited Hokkaido before them is recorded in Japanese sources as early as 1660 (Kudo 1979, 25). These were the Korpokunkur (see Koganei 1896, 22 27). The archaeological appropriation of the Korpokunkur was stimulated by the presence in Hokkaido of overgrown but still distinguishable ancient dwelling pits, together with the fact that late-nineteenth-century Kuril Ainu still used that type of building (Fig. 2.1). According to Milne (1882, 188), T. Blakiston had drawn attention to the pit dwellers of Ezo as early as 1872 (they had also been noticed by Japanese explorer Matsu'ura Takeshiro * in the 1850s [see Matsu'ura 1982: 212]). It was John Milne, however, who was primarily responsible for the development of the Korpokunkur theory in the Western literature. Milne (1880, 1881) argued that although the shell middens found across Japan had probably been made by the Ainu, the pit dwellings of the far north were the remains of a non-Ainu people such as the \"Kamschadales or Alutes.\" By 1882, Milne had heard the Ainu legend of the Korpokunkur from missionary John Batchelor and had made the obvious link between that story and his own field observations. Tsuboi Shogoro* (1863 1913), the most important Japanese anthropologist of the early Meiji era, became the main supporter of the Korpokunkur thesis after Milne. In contrast to Milne, however, Tsuboi argued that the Korpokunkur had produced all the Stone Age remains from across Japan, citing various differences between Stone Age and Ainu cultures (absence of pottery in the latter, lack of beards and clear Ainu features on Stone Age figurines, etc.) to support his theory that the Ainu were unrelated to the Stone Age people. Instead, Tsuboi proposed that the Stone Age relics\n\n< previous page\n\npage_36\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_36.html[1/19/2011 3:45:41 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_37\n\n< previous page\n\npage_37\n\nnext page > Page 37\n\nFig. 2.1.

From Tsuboi's \"Customs of the Koropok-guru\" (Tsuboi 1971b[1885]: 85). had been made by a people who resembled the Eskimos, a conclusion based on the presence of ceramics in both cultures, similarities in clothing, and proposed \"snow goggles\" on some Stone Age figurines (Tsuboi 1887). Tsuboi became the first professor of anthropology at Tokyo University in 1893, but after his death in St. Petersburg in 1913, the Korpokunkur theory was more or less laid to rest with him. The Ainu theory then became the dominant interpretation of the Stone Age remains, supported by Aston (1972[1896], I: 109 110, 1905), Chamberlain (1905), Torii (1920), Matsumoto (1920), Buxton (1925, 208 209), and others. Munro (1911, 661) saw the Ainu as the \"sole survivors of the primitive inhabitants\" of the archipelago; other primitive peoples had included the Hayato and Tsuchigumo mentioned in the Nihon Shoki and the Kojiki. Central to archaeological interpretation at this time was the perceived primitiveness of late-nineteenth-century Ainu culture: \"The reluctance of Tsuboi and Morse to acknowledge that the Ainu were capable of manufac\n\n< previous page\n\npage_37\n\nfile:///C:/Users/User/AppData/Local/Temp/Rar$EX00.355/0824819306/files/page_37.html[1/19/2011 3:45:41 PM]\n\nnext page >\n\npage_38\n\n< previous page\n\npage_38\n\nnext page > Page 38\n\nturing the relatively sophisticated artefacts found on prehistoric sites may reflect general Japanese attitudes toward the Ainu people at this time when Hokkaido was undergoing massive colonisation\" (Fawcett 1986, 51). In the second half of the nineteenth century, similar concerns were being debated in North America as to the identity of the builders of the earthen mounds of the Midwest. It was widely believed that these mounds were too comp"
