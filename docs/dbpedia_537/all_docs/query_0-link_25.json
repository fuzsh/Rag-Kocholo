        "text": "The archaeological site of Gradište near Iđoš, in the municipality of Kikinda, Serbia, is well known in the archaeological literature of the region. Excavated on several occasions since 1913, the site is best known for the existence of a late Neolithic settlement where material culture belonging to both Vinča and Tisza communities was found in the same archaeological contexts. Furthermore, the site is known for a 250 metre diameter fortified settlement from the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age period. А new research cycle was initiated in 2014 in order to explain cultural processes during prehistory in this part of the Pannonian basin. The first season of the new research campaign was focused on geophysical prospection of an area of approximately 2 hectares, geological coring and excavation of four stratigraphic trenches across the site. This work has confirmed the existence of up to 2.5 metres of archaeological remains on the tell site with several daub structures detected and the existence of numerous archaeological features within the Late Bronze - Iron Age settlement.\n\nCommanding a position near the edge of a loess plateau in the southern reaches of the central Carpathian Basin, the site of Gradište Idjoš (variously called Gradište kod Kikinde, Gradište near Idjoš or Idjoš Gradište in literature) in Serbian Banat is a major fortified site of the Later Bronze Age. Our investigations are refining its chronology, though the major phase of settlement appears to belong to c. 15th to 9th century BC, with a possible gap from the 11th to the 10th century BC. Clearly visible in historic maps of the area and in early aerial photographs (Fig. 1), the central fortification consists of a sub-circular rampart probably surrounded by a fosse and up to three other curvilinear ditches at progressively farther distances, all evident from a geophysical survey and aerial imagery. We will begin with a brief overview of the landscape setting of the site, followed by a description of the history of research. We then present an overview of the results of our geophysical survey and excavations at the site in 2014 and 2015, leading up to a preliminary discussion of the ceramics to demonstrate the chronology of the occupation. We conclude with a discussion of the social environment of the site in the Bronze Age, set within the landscape of the »mega-forts« within and bordering the geographical and historical region of Banat (an area now shared by Hungary, Romania and Serbia).\n\nMore detailed archaeological exploration and excavatior at several early medieval fortified settlements in western Slovakia were realized in August-September 2004 within the common project called Summer School of Archaeologiy (Archaeological Institute or the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Nitra - the project manager Matej Ruttkay - and the J. W. Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Mein - the project manager prof. Joachim Henning) and in the framework of the project \"Protection and Rescue of Archaeological and Historical Monuments as an Integral Part of European Cultural Heritage\". The impulse for the risc of thesc projects were also first new results of aerial photography that in several cases brought signs of changes in original ground plans of buildings or a presence of new fortifying structures. The project task was also to educate archaeological youth within the summer school of archaeology as weil as to obtain dendrological samples, which consequently could be evaluated in German laboratories. Special attention was paid to two lowland finding places - inundation fortified settlements in Majcichov and Pobedim. The both were completely geophysical measured and at Majcichov also probing was done that was aimed in finding-out the site state, defining its construction characteristics and also in precising its dating (the best way by dendrohronology). As far as the geophysics is concerned, the measurements from the both fortified settlements brought relatively different results. Whereas the site in Majcichov is outstanding mainly by its weil observable structu re of fortification. in which also detailed construction elements are visible at some point, in Pobedim such observations were not possible. I n spite of the fact that the mound in Pobedim was also destroyed by fire. it does not show remarkably different rnagnetic valucs toward its neighbourhood and its line is only Iess better observable than non-burnt less identifiable segment of the mound in Majcichov. Tue other and basic different in results of geophysical measurements is the presence of archaeological objects inside thc fortified settlement area and out of it as weil. In Majcichov the archaeological objects on the site area were measured only rarely, however, in Pobedirn they are documented almost on the whole acropolis as weil as on the big area of the settlemeot in front. The absence of magnetic anomalies within the fortified settlement in Majcichov cannot automatically indicate the absence of archaeological objects. lt probably is a consequencc of inu ndation layer covering the inner area of the scttlement. Tue archaeological research alone documented a system of thc fortification construction - a mound and a timber chamber construction with foundation grate. Results of the first stage or the project solving prove that a pointed rcsearch can give constant new information on early rnedieval fortified sites. Remarkable precision has been obtained first of all i n the question of knowing of the fortifying construction in Majcichov, in finding of another settlcment agglomerations and in spccifying of complex location of the both sites."
