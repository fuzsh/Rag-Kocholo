        "text": "William Ewart Gladstone was born in Liverpool on December 29, 1809. He came from a very wealthy family. His father had made a fortune from grain, sugar, tobacco, and cotton. He then entered politics and wanted his son to do the same.\n\nWilliam was sent to Eton College, one of Britain’s leading schools, and then to Oxford University. Many of Britain’s politicians had studied at these places. William did well and, just as his father had hoped, took an interest in politics and showed promise as a public speaker.\n\nIn 1832 Gladstone became a member of Parliament as a member of the Conservative Party. It was the start of a lifetime in politics. He was a skillful orator (speaker) and did many important jobs. He was chancellor of the Exchequer four times. As chancellor it was his job to manage the finances of the country.\n\nGladstone’s views slowly changed from conservative to liberal over the course of his career. In 1867 he became the leader of the Liberal Party. He stayed with them for the rest of his political career.\n\nIn 1868 Gladstone became prime minister for the first time. He was prime minister four times and spent about 12 years in the job altogether.\n\nHe was a reformer, and his governments made many changes that improved the lives of ordinary people. For example, in 1870 his government passed a law making education available to many children. In 1884 he passed a law giving more people the right to vote in elections. He also tried to give the Irish people more rights and more power to govern themselves. At the time all of Ireland was ruled by Great Britain.\n\nIn 1894 Gladstone resigned from his fourth term as prime minister. He died four years later, on May 19, 1898, at the age of 88."
