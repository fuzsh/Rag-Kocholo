However, for a variety of reasons, users may encounter offensive or harmful language, for example, language that is racist, sexist, or homophobic, in our finding aids. You may also encounter harmful content in the paper and digital records within archival collections.\n\nStaff are currently implementing practices to address offensive or harmful language and harmful content as part of routine description work. We recognize that terminology evolves over time and that efforts to create respectful and inclusive description must be ongoing.
