        "text": "A SKETCH OP HIS LIFE. * I\n\nThe Eight Hon. William Ewart Gladstone,\n\nstatesman and orator, the fourth son of Sir John\n\nGladstone, Bart., of Fueque, in KincaidineBhiie,\n\n«aa born December 29, 1809, at Liverpool, where\n\nhia father, originally of Leith, had won eminence\n\nand wealth as a Woat India' merchant. Gladstone\n\nwas sent to Eton, and afterwards to Christ Church,\n\nOxford, where he closed a brilliant college career\n\nby taking a double first-class degree in 1831. He\n\nentered tbe House of Commons in 1832 for tho\n\nborough of Newark. He held the post of Lord of\n\nthe Treasury, and afterwards that of Under\n\nSecretary of State tor the Colonies in the reel\n\ngovernment for a few months in 1835. In 1838, he\n\npublished his fisrt work, The State m ils Relations\n\nwith the Church, which gave occasion to Mr.\n\nMacaulay to describe him, iu a celebrated review\n\nof his work, as a 'young man of unblemished\n\ncharacter, the rising hope of those stern and un\n\nbending Tories,' who followed Sir Robert Peel,\n\nwhile they abhorred his cautious temper and\n\nmoderate opinions. In 1811, Gladstone became\n\nV ice-President of the Board of Trade in the Peel\n\nadministration, and in 1813, President of the\n\nBoard. Next to his chief, he took the most\n\nprominent part in the revision of the tariff and\n\nreduction of import dutieB, which reached their\n\nnatural development in the repeal of the Corn\n\nLaws. He resigned office in February 1815, when\n\nSir R. Peel proposed to increase the endowments\n\nof the College of Maynooth, a proposal at variance\n\nwith all the principles laid down by Gladstone in\n\nhis work. He rejoined the ministry in December\n\n1845, 8U3Ceeding the Earl of Derby (who refused\n\nto be a party to the repeal ot the Cora Laws) as\n\nColonial Secretary. Ho rendered Sir R. Peel\n\neloquent and effective aid in carrying the great\n\nmeasure of free trade through the House - of\n\nCommons, but paid the penalty in the Iosb both of\n\nhis office and his seat, for the then Duke of New\n\ncastle, c'aiming to ' do what he liKed with his own,'\n\nrefused to sanction his re-election for Newark. In\n\n1847, he was elected H.P. for the uuiversity of\n\nOxford, which be continued to represent for\n\neighteen years. During a visit to Naples in 1850,\n\nhe was induced by curiosity to attend the trial of\n\nM. Poerio, who was sentenced to several years'\n\nimprisonment, and subjected to indignities .and\n\ncruelties which roused the generous indignation of\n\nthe English statesman. Tbe dungeons of the\n\nkingdom of the Two Sicilies at this period swarmed\n\nwith political prisoners, and Gladstone, in a letter\n\nto the Eavl of Aberdeen, made all Europe ring\n\nwith the story of their sufferings aud their wrongs.\n\nHe after that advocated the causB of Italian inde\n\npendence in many .eloquent speeches. In 1851, he\n\nopposed the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, brought in\n\nby Lord John Russell, thinking that no legislation\n\nwas necesse.ry, and that tbe act Bavoured or\n\nreligious persecution. After refusing an. offer to\n\nhold office under Lord Derby, he became Chancellor\n\nof the Exchequer in the coalition government\n\nformed by the Earl of Aberdeen fn 1852. This\n\nmay bo regarded as the turning point iu Glad\n\nstone's political career. Hitherto he might be\n\ndescribed as a Tory or a Peelite; henceforth he is\n\nLiberal. When the Aberdeen government fell\n\nbeforo a motion in the House of Commons for\n\ninquiring into the state of the army before Sebas\n\ntopol, Gladstone continued for a brief period a\n\nmember of tho cabinet of Lord Palmers-ton, bub\n\nsoon retired, from an unwillingness to consent to\n\ntho appointment of the Sevastopol committee.\n\nGladstone then went into opposition, and in 1857\n\nmade an eloquent aud damaging speech on Mr.\n\nCobden's motion condemnatory of Sir John Bow\n\nring's proceedings iu China, which brought about\n\nthe defeat of Lord PaUr.eraton, and the dissolution\n\nof Parliament. In 185S, Gladstone accepted a\n\nspecial mission of importance to the Ionian Islands.\n\nIn tbe same year ho published an elaborate work\n\non Homer and the Homeric Ago, in 3 vols. In the\n\nsecond Palmerston administration, he resinned the\n\npost of Chancellor of tho Exchequer. In 18G0, ho\n\nearried through Parliament a commercial treaty\n\nwith Prance, which, while it lasted, largely in\n\ncreased the trade between the two, countries. His\n\nfinancial Bcheme that .year involved among other\n\nproposals tbe abolition of the paper-duty, which\n\nwas strongly but unsuccessfully opposed iu the\n\nHouse of Commons. In the Upper House, the\n\nPaper-duty Repeal Bill was thrown out ou financial\n\ngrounds. Gladstone boldly denounced this inter\n\nference with the taxing privileges of the Comiaona.\n\nIn 18G1, he incorporated the repeaL of the paper\n\nduty in tho financii-.l scheme of tho yeniyauil hud\n\nthe satisfaction of witnessing tho removal of the\n\nlast oDBtacie to tno oiBBomination ot knowledge.\n\nRelations with the University constituency had\n\nnow become, eo menacing that in 1861 South\n\nLancashire aBked him to Btand as a liberal candi\n\ndate. This he refused at tbe time; but, rejected\n\nby a majority of his academic constituency ut the.\n\ngeneral election in 18G5, he was returned by South\n\nLancashire third on the . poll. In 18GG, Gladstone,\n\nnow leader of tho House of Commons — Lord\n\nPalmerston having died in 18C5— brought in a\n\nReform Bill, the defeat of which caused Earl\n\nRussell to resign. At the general election iu 1SG8,\n\nS.-W. Lancashire rejected, and Greenwich returned\n\nhim. Acceding to office ae First Lord of the\n\nTreaEUiy at the close of tliat year, Gladstone, in\n\n,1SG9, disestablished the Irish Church; in 1870,\n\ncarried his Irish Land Bill; and in 1871 abolished,\n\nhy tho exerciBO of tho royal prerogative, purchase\n\nin the army. Another event of 1871 was the\n\nWashington Treaty respecting the Alabama claims.\n\nThe Ballot Bill was tbe principal measure carried\n\nby 'Gladstone in 1872. In 1874 Gladstone dissolved\n\nParliament, and, on the unfavourable result of tho\n\nensuing election, the Gladstone ministry resigned.\n\nGladstone was reelected for Greenwich.\n\nMr. Disraeli returned to power iu '71.. Mr. Glad\n\nntono then decided to resign the leadership of tho\n\nLiberalpaity, bntin '75 aroused muoh public indig\n\nnation against tpe atrocities which the Turks wore\n\nperpetrating in Bulgaria. In '79 he made his first\n\nvisit to Midlothian, and on the dissolution of '80 he\n\nwas returned for that constituency, and became, for\n\nthe second time Premier. Amongst the important\n\nActs he carried between '80 and '85 may be men\n\ntioned the Employers' Liability Ac!-, tho second\n\nIrish Land Act, the Hares and Babbits Act, a\n\nreform in fcbe Lsnd Laws, and, chief of all, the I\n\nthird Reform Act and Redistribution Act. After\n\nthe dissolution of the autumn of '85, Mr, Gladstone\n\nagain cBjne forward for Midlothian, and was re\n\nelected by an enormous majority. On the fall of\n\nthe Salisbury Administration, Jan. 26th, '86, Mr.\n\nGladstone was summoned by the Queen to again take\n\noffice. He then held as Premier the office of First\n\nLord of the Treasury and Keeper of the Privy Seal.\n\nIn consequence of a divergence of views between\n\nsome of the leading members of tha Liberal party\n\nand Mr. Gladstone with respect to his proposed\n\nIrish policy, several of his old colleagues, notably\n\nLord Haitington and Sir H. James, did not join his\n\ncabinet — Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Trevelyan, who\n\naccepted office, resigning March 27th. Mr. Glad\n\nstone introduced bills relating to the government\n\nand land of Ireland, the former in a great speeoh\n\non April 8th, and the Sale and Purchase of-Land\n\n(Ireland) Bill on tbe 16th. But the revolt of the\n\nLiberal Unionists became pronounced, the Govern\n\nment were defeated by a majority of 30 on the\n\nHome Rule Bill, and resolved to resign. On July\n\n2nd, at the General Election following, Mr. Glad\n\nstone was elestcd for both Midlothian and Leith,\n\nand chose to Bit for his old constituency, bnt the\n\nresult of the general election was to deprive him of\n\npower. During the remainder of that year and\n\nthroughout '87 little of special importance occurred.\n\nHe visited Italy early iu '88, and was most warmly\n\nreceived. In December he again visited Italy,\n\nreturning in Feb. '89. Hia golden wedding was\n\ncelebrated on July 25th, '89, and the anniversary\n\nof his 81at birthday in '90 was made the occasion of\n\ntho unveiling of a memorial fountain at Hawarden\n\n(Dec. 29th, 90), which bad been erected to com\n\nmemorate the goI'den wedding. During '92 Mr.\n\nGladstone carried out yet another Midlothian\n\nCampaign. He was returned at the general elec\n\ntion, though by a greatly reduced majority, and in\n\nAugust ho became Premier for the fourth time. On\n\nOct. 24th an enthusiastic welcome was given to\n\nhim at Oxford, where he delivered the firBt of the\n\nRomanes lectures, choosing ' Maditeval Univer\n\nsities' for his subject. On April 6th, '93. he moved\n\nthe second reading of the Home Rale Bill in the\n\nHouse of Commons, but the Bill was thrown out by\n\nthe Lords. During his stay at Biarritz, in Feb. '94,\n\na London journal announced his retirement ; but\n\nthe report was contradicted in very guarded terms.\n\nAfter his return to England the report was re\n\nnewed, and in the midet of the uncertainty Mr.\n\nGladstone made hin last speech in the House of\n\nCommons as Prime Minister (March 1st) — the\n\noccasion being the consideration of the Lords'\n\namendments to the Parish Councils Bill. The next\n\nday his resignation was made public, the chief\n\ncause being the discovery that he was Buffering\n\nfrom cataract in both eyes ; and on March 3rd he\n\nhad an audience of the Queen, and gave up the\n\nrbbIb of office. A successful operation for tbe re\n\nmoval, of the cataract was performed in May, and\n\nduring the summer Mr. Gladstone got continuously\n\nstronger. He paid a visit to Cannes early in '95,\n\nand delivered a stirring speech on the Armenian\n\nquestion at Chester in August. His long connec\n\ntion with tho HnUBe of Commons terminated that\n\nyear; for he did not seek re-election at the General\n\nElection. Ho has but rarely taken part in public\n\naffairs since then, the exceptions having been made\n\niu favour of Armenia. He delivered an impreB\n\nsive speeoh at a town's meeting .in Liverpool (Sept.\n\n'96), and while at Cannes, in March '97, he wrote\n\nand published a letter to the Duke of Westminster,\n\npleadin g the cause of Crete and Greece as againstTur\n\nkey. His efforts on behalf of the oppressed Armenians\n\nwero recognised in Jan. of the same year by the\n\nunveiling of a stained gins? window in Hawarden\n\nChurch in commemoration of the Armenian martyrs,\n\nand by the presentation to Mrs. Gladstone of a por\n\ntrait of His Holiness Mighriditch I., Supreme\n\nPatriarch of the Armenians. Mr. Gladstone's\n\nillness was caused by a foreign growth in the nose,\n\nwhich in consequence of his advanced age and\n\nweakness, could not be removed with safety by an\n\nopeiation. His later day* were attended with\n\nintense bodily Buffering, which, however,' waR home\n\nwith patience and bravery. Mr. Gladstone's\n\nliterary efforts have resulted in many valu\n\nable workB, and cover a most extensive\n\nfield. In his early manhood ho published '* The\n\nState in its Relations with the Church,' and his\n\npamphlet on tho Neapolitan atrocities in '51\n\ncaused a remarkable sensation. 'Studies in\n\nHomer' followed, and 'Juventns Mundi,' while\n\nthe pamphlet on the ' Bulgarian Horrors' ia still\n\nfresh in memory. In '8G Mr. Gladstone and Pro\n\nfessor Huxley crossed swords in the Nineteenth\n\nCcn'nry over Science and Revelation. In '90 he\n\npuhlishod 'Landmarks of Homeric Study,' and\n\nalso 'The Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture,'\n\nwhich reached a second and much amplified edition\n\nin '92. A volume of translations of tho Odes of\n\nHorace, the firstfruits of his release from political\n\ntoil, was published in Nov. '94, and a Commentary\n\non the Psalter in '95. In '9G there appeared a now\n\nedition of ' Butler's Works' arranged and anno\n\ntated by him, and a volume of ' StudieB Subsidiary\n\nto the Works of Bishop Butler.'\n\nMr. Gladstone's death (says tho Daily Mer\n\ncury on Friday) for tho moment puts asido in\n\nour thoughts all othor events, albeit many\n\ngreat events aro happoning. Tho world to-day\n\nis as it were standing by tho tomb of a great\n\nman. And to bedeck that great man's^grave,\n\nwo may as crowning laurel attach the sen\n\ntence,—' Dying, ho loft the world better\n\nthan he found it.' For more than sixty\n\nyears prior to his - retirement in 1894.\n\nto the domestic seclusion whence ho has\n\nnow emorged into tho vaster life beyond tho\n\ngrave, ho was one of tho most considerable\n\nfigures in Groat Britain. Ho led a stately\n\npublic life, the story of tho main par- !\n\nticulars of which is told elsewhere. Dur\n\ning his long and majestic career ho\n\naehioved incalculable good for his country\n\nmen and for the world. A voico silvor\n\ntone'd, persuasive, bringing to its exercise\n\na storo of fit words from a mind marvel\n\nlously fertile in ideas as well, was oyer\n\nraised, a ready pon was promptly used effec\n\ntively, in the rsdrcss of crying wrong, in\n\ndenunciation of tyranny, in wrathful and\n\nscathing reproach of evildoers in high\n\nplaces. In that great historic theatre of\n\nlegislative action wherein Englishmen do\n\ntheir will, Gladstone's ardour, devotion\n\nto tho public good, unweariable diligenco,\n\nand matchless mental gifts gradually gained\n\nfor the British peoplo a political emancipation\n\nwhich places them among tho freest peoplos\n\non tho planet. His wero tho brain and the\n\nenorgy which planned and partially effected\n\nwide-reaching schemes for doing justice to\n\nand permanently conciliating that unhappy\n\nmember of tho United Kingdom which Eng\n\nlish statesmen had long alternately coerced\n\nand caressed. And though opinions on Home\n\nRule for Ireland diffej* greatly, honest and\n\nreasonable thinkers accord to Mr. Gladstone's\n\nendeavours to achiovo it tho honour due to a\n\nnoble purpose. Freetrado, extension of\n\nBritain's commerce, popular education, legis\n\nlation tending to amoliorato differences\n\n?, between religious bodies, are all reforms\n\nand movements bearing the impress of\n\nhis mighty hand and of his vast\n\ncapacity. Unmeasured as was his power\n\nof invective against principles which ne\n\nopposed, he was a chivalrous and magnani- I\n\nmous fighter as to the personality of his\n\nopponents. For this great man was ever j\n\ndominated by a religion which entered into\n\nevery action ; and, wliilo his domestic and\n\nsocial life was conspicuously pure and beauti\n\nful, his public career was regulated by the\n\npromptings of a conscience intent to be void\n\nof offenco towards God and towards man.\n\nThe operation of conscience is the explanation\n\nof those sompwbat remarlcablo changes of\n\nopinion which the future historian ? of\n\ntho roign of Victoria will record in tho\n\nCareer of her greatest subject. No one can\n\nunderstand Gladstono who fails to realise his\n\nfidelity to consciontious conviction in all ho ?\n\ndid. Ho was not indeed a porfect man; in\n\nsome provinces of statecraft he blundered\n\nsadly, and tho Britain of to-day suffers ; he\n\nwas occasionally tho victim of a generous im\n\npulse, which forbade an accurate forecast of\n\npublic consequences ; and ho was in somo\n\naspects of his political charactor a dreamer\n\nand an enthusiast. But he was nevertheless a\n\ngreat Englishman, of whom tho historian\n\nabove-mentioned will write as one of tho"
