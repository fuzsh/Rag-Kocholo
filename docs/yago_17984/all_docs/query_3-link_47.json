'Legendary Panty Mask' is a much funnier film despite 'I Am Sukeban' going all in with the cartoon comedy. The comedy works best when it causes the film to completely shift direction such as the changing room scene which transforms the film into a 1920's silent film and the flashback scene which turns the film into to a 1970's delinquent film.\n\nA lot of the comedy is beyond stupid and made me think of the type of games you would playâ€¦"
