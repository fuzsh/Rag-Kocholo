At age 19, she appeared in the theatrical film Kiss Me or Kill Me (å±ããªãã¦ãæãã¦ã, Kiss me or kill me: Todokanakutemo aishiteru), directed by Naoyuki Tomomatsu and released March 12, 2005 by TMC.[2][3] She also made a gravure (non-sex) video in March 2005 titled Wash Me![4] and she made her debut as an adult video (AV) actress in the April 2005 Kuki Tank release In Love.[5] She continued working for Kuki through 2005, most often with director Harry Sugino, before moving on to other studios.\n\nOutside the adult video field, Asami appeared in several V-Cinema releases and theatrical films including starring in the February 2006 film Sukeban Boy or Oira Sukeban (ãããå¥³è® ã¹ã±ãã³, Oira sukeban), directed by Noboru Iguchi, where she played a boy with a girl's face who decides to join a girls' school.[6][7] One reviewer commented that she is \"a woman playing a boy playing a girl. Which isn't easy to pull off. However, she actually does a thoroughly decent job of it.\"[8]\n\nIn 2008, she also had a lead role playing the title heroine's sidekick Miki in Noboru Iguchi's gore-fest The Machine Girl which premiered at the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in March 2008.[9][10] She reprised her role (billed as Asami Sugiura) in the January 2009 V-Cinema sequel Shyness Machine Girl, although no new footage of her was shot for the short.[11][12] In between, she also had a part in YÅ«dai Yamaguchi's horror film Tamami: The Baby's Curse released in August 2008.[13]\n\nFor her performances in such pink films as Female Prisoner Ayaka: Tormenting and Breaking in a Bitch,[14] Asami won 3rd place in the \"Best New Actress\" category at the Pink Grand Prix for the year 2008.[15] Her performance in director Tsukasa SatÅ's Three Slaves (ä¸å¹ã®å¥´é·, Sanbiki no Dorei) won Asami the Best Actress award at the ceremony for 2009.[16]\n\nAsami's November 2008 adult video with three other actresses, Three Sisters Ninja Sex, a period costume female ninja (kunoichi) piece, was the Kasakura entry for the 2009 AV Grand Prix contest.[17] At the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, Media Station's Bazooka label released three elaborate historical cosplay AVs starring Asami.[18][19][20] Asami announced her retirement from the AV industry November 8, 2008 to devote herself to mainstream acting as Asami Sugiura.[21]\n\nSugiura continued her association with director Noboru Iguchi, whom she credits with giving her the chance to do mainstream film work,[22] with a role in his 2009 film RoboGeisha.[23] In 2010, she starred in the action films Yakuza-Busting Girls: Duel in Hell (éè¥²ï¼ã¹ã±çªâãã³ã¿ã¼ãºãï½å°çã®æ±ºéï½, GyakushÅ«!
