        "text": "Oira Sukeban (Japanese: おいら女蛮, \"I'm a Sukeban\"), sometimes called Sukeban Boy, is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Go Nagai, serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday from 1974 to 1976. It is a comedy with several sexy touches, where the protagonist Banji Suke (or Sukeban) has to disguise himself as a girl in order to be able to attend an all-female school to try and clear his name after being left the blame for the chaos all over town, while unaware that his assassins are watching his every move. As Suke Ban is a rebellious boy, this situation creates several comedic troubles.\n\nThe manga was adapted to an OVA in 1992 and was released by ADV Films in the US under the name Delinquent in Drag.\n\nIt has also spawned two live-action movies, Oira Sukeban: Kessen! Pansuto (おいら女蛮 決戦!パンス党) in 1992 starring actor Shinji Takeda, and Oira Sukeban (2006 Film) (called mostly Sukeban Boy) in 2006 starring AV idol Asami (亜紗美).\n\nCharacters[]\n\nBanji Suke\n\nBankaku Suke\n\nBanchiyo Suke\n\nKanko Renau\n\nOtoko Dan\n\nTochinta Tomoe\n\nYochien Fujimura\n\nEliza\n\nRentan\n\nManga[]\n\nWhen someone translates it, post it here.\n\nAnime OAV[]\n\nIt starts with Banji Suke and his dad Bankaku Suke running from the mom, Banchiyo Suke' wrath as she suits up in soem leather bodysuit and busting their house with a metal chain. She does ninja moves and busts the ground like the street sharks but it opens a water main and dad/son log roll on a garbage can. Dad blames Banji for getting in a fight and getting kicked out and mom busts the town in a b--chy fury but not like modern day chicks who are b--chy and you hate them like the remakes of 80s shows. Banji blames dad for beating up his boss and they bicker until mom gets near em and whips at em like Castlevania. The next day the fam says sorry for going mental like commies when a cop is found not guilty of defending himself against some devolved guy and makes em move out of the neighborhood. mom sez sorry for being mental and making it so they gotta move out and crys and dad comforts her and mom starts b0ning dad in front of their son. Banji goes back to his room or whats left of it and wonders how they can b0ne in front of him and later they move away as the hood celebrates and then runs from the crumbling cr-pshack they f--ked up as it falls.\n\nThey move into an apartment and Mom finds this pendant that looks like the Red Getter Robo ship and dad gets a uniforme for the Amazon Academy but the worker there puts Banji as a girl for enrolment\n\nThen Title\n\nThen its the 1st day of school and mom wants Banji to get going or he'd be late and slaps dad for wanting a kiss and wants him to get to work. She gives Banji the Getter Robo Pendant and sez it'll go well with his uniforme. In the elevator Banji gets dressed and its a girls uniforme and he dont like it but dad sez \"its ok, every one does it\" and runs off when Banji thinks he screwed up. He runs to class thinking what kinda school has boys wear girl clothes cuz this is before the gender offenders attacked and devolved the protoculture and at school saves a guy being beat up by some tough chick by nailing her in the head with huis school bag.\n\nShe sez to stay safe at school by No b0ning outside of marriage or you might get aids or mouth and butt cancer keeping out of the Pantyhose Brigade's way and sends her gang to beat the black offa him til hez whiter den Michael Jackson homie, wiggle wiggle, blicketee black yo, aids! she plays a leaf like a flute like riki-Oh and her gang takes off their skirts to have colored leggings and attacks him but Banji is billy bada55 and beats them out cuz in the 70s and 80s guys could beat up chicks and we didn't have whiny feminists b--ching about their gender issues like \"men make more money\" but really its a brain surgeon making more than his nurse assistant. After beating up a buncha girls he faces the chick and she offers him a chance to join em but he sez no. she lifts up her skirt and Banji comes in to see even thought shes the enemy and its a fight. The headmaster looks on with opera binoculars and sez \"Now its Renaun Kanko's turn and I guess thats the leaders name. Banji looks at her under the skirt and she Jams a 9 inch b0ner in his mouth kicks him and juggles him in the air with kicks like its a fighting game. She nails him in the air high with a Dancing Mach Kick like its Dragon Ball with Chichi and Goku before he b0ned her pregnant and she pooped out candya55 Gohan, then plans to finish him with a knee crush, but Banji comes down crotch 1st and gets it in her face and gets his skirt on her head and poots which leaves her foaming at the mouth with what I hope isnt Banji's spurm.\n\nBanji goes to class hearing the bell and is introduced as a chick and the guys and think hes cute which is probably gonna turn em queer if they find out. Banji now knows his dad f'd up and he cant tell em cuz they'd make fun of him being a purvurt and queer and he'd kick their candy a55es and mom would beat him like a slave. So he goes with it and they call him Sukeban. He sits next to the cute innocent Otoko Dan who's name means boy child or something manly and they share a textbook and he wants her to call him sukeban. Banji is gay for her in a hetero way and she notices something about her liking him cuz she feels like hes a guy and might be gay for him. she worries of turning queer and banji spazzes out and she takes banji to da nurse. Banji's in bed and fakes a fever to get her close and get his face in her t-ts. she smax him with a pillow and goes to call teacher and Banji sez he was sick as a kid and never had a real friend and only wants to be friends but he can avoid her like strangers if she wants. She agrees to be Bannis friend and Banji tries smooching and h-mping her but she like all \"no i dont swing that way, its not like for 2 girls to do that\" but Sukeban's tummy growls and Otoko thinks Sukeban needs food and is acting weird cuz of that. Cuz if you get hungry enough you turn queer.\n\nAt dad's work he's glad his fake resume got him a job, although nowadays he can just \"identify\" as something and he is it, so if I wanna be a brain surgeon, I identify as one and boom, imma real brain surgeon. Dad wonders what his woman is up to and how Banji might come home and they might start doing naked things but thinks they are only mom and son and there's an age difference. Then as he is about to smoke, he remembers they had Banji when dad was in 1st year jr high and mom was in grade 5(good f--k! he b0ned a grade schooler?! what are you? bi den jr?!) but this is japan so its cool, like all those little girl anime with the little girls and the grown men, or the lgtbqia2+map classic: Boku No Pico! so Mom is only 11 years older than her son and dad spazzers out and worried of his woman and son b0ning and they might get married as i guess Japan has marriage equality for same family couples cuz its natural and animals do it and it dont matter who you love and other cr-p THEY wanna make us think. So dad goes home and Banji thinks on how faking being a chick lets him get away with anything like going in the little girls room and watching the chicks change and grabbing chicks b00bns and getting his face in their a55es and how a 30 year old woman b0ning a 12 year old gets less hate than a 24 year old man b0ning a 17 year old woman and Banji h-mps a Gyaru mannequin as a buncha Go Nagai Characters watch.\n\nHe runs home thinking how these stangers he never met think hes a purvo and at home sees his thicc sexy mom in undies. Mom shows off her curvy bod in her undies and asks what he thinks of em and poses all hot and Banji dont wanna answer. Mom wonders why her don is like this and thinks he dont love her anymore but he tries to explain how she's only 11 years older than him and hes in jr high and might feel excited so she starts j-rkin him off and dad comes in and sees em. Dad spazzes out and blamers his son for huis lusty housewife and mom sez \"you don't really believe that d ja?!\" so they fight with her in partly see through undies and she beats his fat a55. Banji tries to stop it but gets his arms around his sexy mom and dad thinks hes gonna do stuff and Mom chucks Banji into the wall. At school the headmaster summons a buncha students and these baseball dinks Rentan and some midget play catch and talk of how the headmaster (Head On!) offered a lot of money for beating Banji Suke and now they can have money to do their baseball cr-p. but baseball s-cked! its p[laying catch a ,mole away and takes forever. Tochinta Tomoe is at the shore and his mom gives him his dead dads scroll of the Tomoe family secret move(like Hotaru Tomoe from Sailor Moon?!). At home Banjis rents b0ne and make up iun front of him.\n\nThe next day Banji looks up Otoko;'s skirt and the baseball pitcher throws a baseball at Banji but he catches it easy cuz hes zee ubermench. Rentan wants them to send an official challenge like a man and the other guy, Yochien Fujimura sez he did and the baseball has a message: Meet me 3 days after class for a fight. in banji's cubby is a lot of letters and its not love letters but challenges and otoko wonders if banji did something to p-ss em off but he sez he only came to the school yesterday. The Ping Pong club fires lead balls at otoko and banji and they run as the balls break the walls. Headmaster watches from above wanting the pendant and sukeban runs by a trap by the flower arranging club but jumps over it with otoko so the ping pong club falls in it.\n\nThe garden club attacks him with scissors and they have spikes on their as armor like plates of spikes so Banji can't hit em and they dodge and escape. They run back to da school and otoko is worried but banji thinks its fun they come out but not like back xdoor bruce and Tochinta Tomoe challenges him to a joido matc. Banji remembers a similar named guy in Juko Ichokusen from a 70s shonen manga and its toshita tomoe but Otoko says this guy is toCHInta Tomoe and Tochinta gets p-ssed as they laugh. Banji faces him cuz its a 1 on 1 challenge and not everyone ganging upo on him but otoko sez hes strong and dangerous. Banji accepts his challenge and then the sun is going down and Banji gets on a Gi and finds theres no dojo for the judo club cuz tochinta is the only member like melvin and his snail watching club in the 90s dub of sailor moon. Banji draws a square and the teens joke about tochinta having a lusty and he accidentally mentions banjis b00bs. They fights and he notices banji isnt wearing a bra and is bashful so Banji queers out and comes onto Tomoe and he is embarrassed. Tomoe's mom comes in and sez hes embarrassing the fam and tomoe gets srs and grabs banji and does the tomoe secret technique: Tomoe Tornado Down Attack! Where Tomoe spins the guy and gains momentum and the oe gets dizzy and loses balance and dies somehow.. but when the tornado ends, sukeban is ok and tomowe is buried alive like that pokemon thing. mom realizes its meant to only be done on a tatami matt and by spinning on his toes, he drilled in the ground which is pretty stoopid but this is an anime so it works. Mom digs up her dead son and brings him back to eat or b0ne or something. I mean this is by Go Nagai! Remember Blue and Mad Saulus?. So the baseball guy sends him a baseball saying \"dont lose until we fight\" and otoko sez to talk to a teacher so he dont gotta fight but banji thinks it'll be fun and runs into the sun as the baseball c-ck suckers catch and pitch but not in bed.\n\nCameoes[]\n\nA lot.
