It is a comedy with several erotic touches, where the protagonist Banji Suke (or Sukeban) has to disguise himself as a girl in order to be able to attend an all-female school. As Suke Ban is a rebellious boy, this situation creates several comedic troubles.<br />\n\nThe manga was adapted to an OVA in 1992 and has spawned two live-action movies, Oira Sukeban: Kessen! Pansuto ( !) in 1992 starring actor Shinji Takeda, and Oira Sukeban (called mostly Sukeban Boy) in 2006 starring AV idol Asami (). The OVA was released by ADV Films in the US, under the name Delinquent in Drag. The series has also been named by d/visual in Italy as La canaglia in minigonna.<br />\n\n<br />"
