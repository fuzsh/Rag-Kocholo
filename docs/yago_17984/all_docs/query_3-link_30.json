It might be, if the girls knew you were a guy, but to stay in school teenage pervert Banji can't let can't let anyone find out his chromosomes don't match. Banji's status conscious parents want him to go to a good school, but not enough to spend the money on a good co-ed school. Now, in addition to studying math and science, Banji has to learn how to put on a bra and makeup. His life has become a living hell. Not only is he at the bottom of the social pecking order, he must also got to conceal his inner-masculinity from the pretty classmate girl who's stolen his heart while avoiding the female bullies who threaten to expose his less-than-feminine charms in the locker room.",

        "text": "i'd give it two stars higher if there wasn't a scene where the dad literally stared into the camera and said \"my wife was in fifth grade when i impregnated her, so the age gap for her to have sex with our son is small enough as to be ethical - albeit a scenario i would dislike due to it being adulterous\" and then nothing came of it\n\nImagine Ranma ½ with all its over-the-top action around an eccentric cast, but the main character in this case doesn't change gender to wear female clothing. Excessively perverted, dumb as hell and stuck on an unresolved ending since there was no follow-up OVA, but god damn if this wasn't exactly my kind of shit.\n\nPerhaps the worst anime ever made, an incoherent, offensive, and disgusting experience from start to finish. I am surprised this is even available on YouTube, it should've been lost to history long ago.\n\nLet me give a quick rundown of how the film goes so you can see how crazy it is. The premise is that of a high school student expelled from so many schools that the only option left for him is an all-girl school. A little bit strange, but there seemed to be at least decent potential for comedy, so I was willing to give the film a chance. Sadly for me, even the smallest attempts at good comedy crash and burn spectacularly in this film.\n\nAs…\n\nsheer unrepentant id, just fucking doing whatever it's not supposed to for no other reason than because its funny to do things youre not supposed to. like. there is absolutely no deeper thought to any of the content on display here than 'lol'. no value judgements, no passage through the superego; no filtration.\n\nWhat else is there to say?\n\nI barely remember much about watching this pile of shit (during my old \"Movies from Hell\" streams back when Livestream.org was a free service) except that it was fucking annoying, the entire cast was unlikable and the animation, even for the time, was kinda crap.\n\nShit fucking sucks ass, yo. Go watch a better Go Nagai adaptation, for fuck's sake. Skip this turd.\n\nBased on an early Gō Nagai manga, in Japan known as Oira Sukeban or Sukeban Boy, the 1992 OVA Delinquent In Drag is instantly Nagai-esque as it tells the offbeat story of a delinquent boy with a dysfunctionally incestual family who is accidentally forced into an all-girl’s school while taking up an identity as a girl to avoid embarrassment as rude antics and fighting ensue...as every sports team can’t comprehend how a woman can be tough? How they don’t see through the disguise is beyond me as he doesn’t even try to mask his voice for half the film. Also halfway through the film they introduce this whole second character that seems to be a parody of an old judo sports…"
