        "text": "DVD Times (via Kung Fu Cult Cinema) reports that Universal Studios Home Video will release Akihiko Shiota's live-action film adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's Dororo manga on Region 1 DVD. The adventure film follows Hyakkimaru, a rōnin samurai who lost 48 body parts to his father's pact with demons, after he is abandoned as an infant and raised by a doctor who restored his body with prosthetics. A vagabond boy thief named Dororo joins Hyakkimaru as they journey to find the demons and restore Hyakkimaru's body. The 2007 film stars Kou Shibasaki (Battle Royale's Mitsuko Sōma) and Satoshi Tsumabuki (Dragon Head's Teru Aoki). Two more movies are planned in Japan for 2009, and Vertical released the first volume of the manga in North America in April.\n\nCult film DVD distributor Discotek posted on its website that it will offer Noboru Iguchi's live-action film adaptation of Gō Nagai's Sukeban Boy (Oira Sukeban) risque comedy manga \"before the end of the year.\" The Machine Girl director wrote the screenplay about a biker gang member's handsome son who is kicked out of every school — until the father forces his son to masquerade as a girl and enroll into an all-girls school. The manga was previously made into an anime video in 1987 and released by ADV Films under the title Delinquent in Drag.\n\nThank you to Daniel Zelter for the news tips."
