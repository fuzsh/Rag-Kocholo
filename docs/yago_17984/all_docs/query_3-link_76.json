Comments containing intentional and unprovoked spoilers (posts like \"X is the Beast Titan\" \"X is Y's brother\") that are clearly not theories or guesses will result in an instant ban.\n\n- Pointless text/text that can be identifiable as spoliers such as \"Everyone dies\" or \"Han shot first!\" is not allowed. We are not Meme Central nor do we want to be.\n\n- If you want to discuss future episodes, we have a channel dedicated to spoilers on our Discord.\n\nSelf-Promoting / Advertising\n\n- While it is okay to mention other anime/manga websites, do not deliberately advertise them.\n\n- These types of Youtube videos will not be tolerated:\n\nNon anime related\n\n\"Anime Rant\" videos will be removed since we have no way of confirm whether it's for self-promoting or no.\n\n- Also, comments are not an advertising board!\n\nComments containing just links with no text will usually be removed, unless they're an answer to another comment.\n\nAny links leading to viruses/phishing sites/etc are forbidden."
