        "text": "Go Nagai creator of Mazinger Z , Violence Jack and Cutie Honey . Always surprises me whenever I find work I haven’t seen. this series where the protagonist Banji Suke who after a clerical screw up send him a wrong school uniform and has to dress as a girl to attend school . As Suke Ban is a rebellious boy who comes from a completely dysfunctional family where they constantly beat the shit out of each other constantly or goes down the perverted route creates a comedic tension.\n\nWhen he attends the school the evil Principal witnesses a fight between him and a rebel gang of pantyhose girls(seriously that’s their name) sees his necklace given to him by his step mother and desires it for no apparent reason and sends every club after him to claim the necklace.\n\nThe story is quite simple . But there’s something you can get from the show . Things are taken up in straight value . He wears a sailor fuku outfit -there for he is now a female . Which makes the reader in on a joke that only you and the main character were in on.\n\nThe animation is quite dated but still enjoyable with 80’s style music .\n\nIs worth a watch sure but don’t think your going to get anything deep or meaning full because with a lot of his work . He wanted to address a few issues of the time but overall he just did because he thought it was fun."
