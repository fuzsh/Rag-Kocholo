If you’re planning your Croatian itinerary and wondering if Pula is worth visiting, this blog post is for you.

Although it might not be amongst the most popular cities in Croatia, Pula is a small town with a lot to offer. Because of that, I’m bringing you a detailed post about Pula, so you can decide if you think it’s worth putting it in your itinerary!

WHERE IS PULA?

Pula is situated at the southern tip of the Istrian Peninsula. It’s one of the biggest towns in Istria, and it’s about 35 kilometers from Rovinj, and about 100 kilometers from Rijeka. It’s also fairly close to Italy, with Trieste being only 120 kilometers northwest of Pula.

Pula’s coastal location on the Adriatic Sea makes it a popular destination for tourists who enjoy the historical sites and lovely beaches in smaller, less crowded towns.

HOW TO REACH PULA?

You can reach Pula in many different ways; it all depends on your preferences and where you’re coming from. Here are the best options for you:

If you’re flying in, you perhaps you can fly directly into Pula. Pula has an international airport, which is located about 6 kilometers from the city center. There are direct flights from many European cities, especially during the tourist season. Usually, the cheaper airlines such as Ryan Air connect these cities.

If you require a bigger airport, the closest airports are Zagreb, Trieste, or Venice. From any of them you can get a bus to Pula, or a private transfer.

If you are traveling from within Croatia or nearby countries, driving is a convenient option. Pula has great connections with many Croatian, as well as Italian and Slovenian cities, so you won’t have any problem reaching it by car. It’s also the most flexible and comfortable way of travel, so you’ll definitely enjoy it.

If you’re opting for public transport, Pula has great bus connections to other Croatian cities and neighboring countries. There are regular bus services from Zagreb, Rijeka, and Rovinj, as well as international routes from Slovenia, Italy, and other nearby countries. You can check out Flixbus for international buses and Arriva for Croatian bus services to find the perfect route for you. The main bus station is located near the city center, so you can easily reach the town and your accommodation on foot.

Finally, you can also access Pula by ferry. Pula has a port with ferry connections to nearby islands and other coastal cities in Croatia. You can check out the connections here. You can also access Pula by ferry from Venice (Italy) or Piran (Slovenia).

DO YOU NEED A CAR IN PULA?

If you’re thinking of just exploring Pula, then you don’t need a car. Pula is a relatively small town and you can see all most important historical sites on foot. However, if you’re interested in visiting beaches which are further away, or exploring the Istrian peninsula, you’ll definitely need a car.

IS PULA WORTH VISITING?

In my opinion, Pula is definitely worth a visit, at least for a day. This town offers a rich blend of history, culture, and natural beauty, and you’ll love your time here. To give you some additional motivation to visit Pula, here are some of the best things to do in Pula!

BEST THINGS TO DO IN PULA, CROATIA

VISIT AND EXPLORE THE HISTORICAL SITES

Pula Arena

The first and most important landmark in Pula is the Arena, one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheaters in the world. It is one of the six largest surviving Roman arenas in the world and it was built between 27 BC and AD 68. It once hosted gladiatorial contests and public spectacles, and today it hosts various events and concerts, providing a unique experience in a historical setting.

You can enter and explore the amphitheater for only 10 euros per person.

Temple of Augustus

The Temple of Augustus is a well-preserved Roman temple dedicated to the first Roman emperor, Augustus. It was constructed between 2 BC and AD 14 during his reign and it’s a prime example of Roman architecture. You’ll find it in heart of the Forum Square, another important Roman landmark in Pula.

Arch of the Sergii

Arch of the Sergii is a triumphal arch built around 27 BC, also known as the Golden Gate. It commemorates the Sergii family, an important Roman family, and was erected in the late 1st century BC. The arch is not only an important historical monument but also a symbol of Pula’s rich Roman heritage.

ENJOY BRIJUNI NATIONAL PARK

Brijuni National Park is one of the best day trips you can take from Pula. This national park is a group of 14 islands famous for their scenic beauty and historical sites.

You can catch a ferry from Fažana, a small village near Pula, which will take you to Veliki Brijun, the biggest of the islands. There, you can explore the island for hours, ride bikes, visit the safari, and even swim in the sea.

VISIT THE BEACHES

While Pula isn’t famous for its beaches like Makarska for example, it still has some gorgeous ones worth visiting.

First of them is the famous Hawaii Beach. This beach is a small yet beautiful pebble beach with clear water, popular among both locals and tourists. It got its name after the wavy beaches of Hawaii, although this one doesn’t really have big waves. The crowds are considerate during summer, so keep that in mind.

Ambrela Beach is a bit closer, located in Verudela. It’s a well-maintained beach very popular with families. It’s bigger than Hawaii Beach and it’s got facilities such as chairs, umbrellas, sports equipment, and snack bars!

TRY THE LOCAL CUISINE

Istrian cuisine is really popular in Croatia, with some of the most delicious seafood, truffles, and local wines in the country. You can try it at many restaurants and konobas (traditional taverns) around the city.

EXPLORE ISTRIA

Finally, the best thing to do while you’re in Pula is to explore the rest of the Istrian peninsula. Istria is one of the prettiest parts of Croatia and it’s absolutely worth exploring. Towns like Rovinj and Grožnjan are so picturesque and charming that you’ll be left speechless. Explore the old towns, visit the hilltop towns, and eat some good food along the way.
