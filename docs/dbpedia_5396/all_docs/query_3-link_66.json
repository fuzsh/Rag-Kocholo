        "text": "Pinamalayan is a first-class municipality located in the eastern part of the province of Oriental Mindoro, Mindoro Island. It is approximately 71 kilometers away from the provincial capital of Calapan City and 254 kilometers away from the national capital of Manila. Based on the certification by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), it has an estimated total land area of 28,226 hectares comprised by 37 barangays. These are further classified into eight urban barangays and 29 rural barangays. Furthermore, there are ten coastal barangays. Among all the barangays, Sabang has the largest land area at 8,799.20 hectares while Zone IV has the smallest land area at 10.65 hectares.\n\nAccording to the PSA, Pinamalayan has a total population of 86,172 with a growth rate of 1.03 percent. Total number of households is at 19,276 based on the CBMS Survey (2014). It is the most populous municipality after Calapan City and Naujan. Out of the 37 barangays, Marfrancisco is the most populous followed by Papandayan which is expected to be the most populous barangay in the coming years. The level of urbanization increased in the last 25 years. In 2000, 2010, and 2015, the urbanization level of Pinamalayan was higher than the provincial level.\n\nThe existing land use shows that about 16,904.2 hectares or 60% of the municipal land is utilized for various crops and fruit-bearing trees (Map Q). The top agricultural crops in terms of area utilization and annual production are as follows: rice, banana, coconut, fruit trees, and vegetables.\n\nOver the course of history, agriculture is an important economic activity in the municipality. Furthermore, its crops have a product market that reaches up to the neighboring provinces of Cavite, Batangas, Marinduque and Romblon, as well as the national capital of Manila. It also has a market in the Visayas, particularly in Iloilo. The main cash crop is rice, for it has the greatest annual production and largest generated income.\n\nAs summarized in the succeeding graphs, the general trend of area utilization (Figure EC-1), annual production (Figure EC-2), and annual generated values (Figure EC-3) have slightly increased in the years 2014 to 2015. However, all of the production volumes and generated revenues of major crops for the year 2016 have decreased drastically, compared to that of the 2014 and 2015 values.\n\nAccording to interviews, one of the crops that has potential to be developed is the abaca or Manila Hemp. This plant is mostly grown on the higher elevations of the municipality but the trend cannot be observed because of the lack of data for the years 2014 to 2015. In 2016, the area utilized for such crop was at 86 hectares, with a yield of 15 metric tons and more than one million pesos in revenues.\n\nLooking into the historical data for both agricultural land utilization and volume of production, an inverted relationship was observed between 2014 and 2015. While the total land utilization increased by 0.01 percent, production decreased by 7.42 percent (Table EC-1). Between 2015 to 2016, however, the decrease in agricultural areas and production became even more evident for there was a 7.79 percent decrease in area utilization and 35.66 percent decrease in production (Table EC-2). The results for each major crop is also shown in the said tables.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, the greatest productivity per area were that of vegetables at 14.52 and 8.01 metric tons per hectare, respectively. While in 2016, rice had the most yield per area at 4.64 metric tons per hectare (Table EC-3).\n\nBut as displayed by Figure EC-4, the yield of coconuts and rice for the past three years has almost remained constant, while the yield for bananas, fruit trees, and vegetables have sharply decreased. All of these values, however, are showing declining productivity.\n\nIncreasing the land utilized for agriculture alone may not be a good strategy to increase overall agricultural production. Since typhoon occurrence is a major factor that can influence the level of production, it might be better to consider shifting cropping patterns combined with expanding land area for agricultural utilization. Since climate change is also expected to bring more hostile conditions for farming, sustainable production practices should also be supported, studied, and promoted. Availability of post-harvest facilities is of course given.\n\nAs of the 2014 CBMS, 20 percent of households are engaged in agriculture. Barangay Sabang has the largest percent share of households at 78 percent while the least percent share of households comes from barangays Wawa and Zone II, with both at one percent. Other pertinent data per barangay are presented by Table EC-4.\n\nTable EC-5 shows a summary of the water irrigation system present in the municipality. The NIA-Pula-Bansud River Irrigation System (RIS) has been operating since 1960. Since then, several rehabilitation works were taken through the Irrigation Operation Support Project (IOSP). It diverts the water through a run-off type river dam located across the Pula River in barangay Inclanay. The system currently serves 18 barangays in Pinamalayan, two in Socorro, and another two in Pola. It is also reported that the existing irrigation facilities inadequately supplies water in some areas, resulting to adverse effects in production. Thus, it is recommended that canals should be rehabilitated, as well as to concretize existing farm ditch canals. See Appendix G for the irrigation map from NIA.\n\nAgricultural Support Facilities\n\nIn 2016, the number of agricultural support facilities has a total of 1,665 units. However, Table EC-7 shows a decline in the number of these facilities from 2014 to 2016. The most common farm equipments used in the municipality are tractors, threshers, blowers, rice mills, and combine harvesters. Most of these are 100 percent utilized and are operational, except for some units of rice mills. Further information regarding other facilities are shown in the said table.\n\nSome problems were also raised regarding these support facilities. First is the absence of an existing ordinance to regulate the usage of mechanical dryers for rice. Moreover, attention should also be given to the lack of facilities for post-harvest handling, processing, as well as preservation of agricultural produce. This is essential to be able to ensure longer shelf life, quality, and fair pricing. This is needed especially during the times of excess supply and this can also give farmers more income options.\n\nIn addition, there is one public market located at the Poblacion which currently has a functional area of 1,508.70 square meters and has 165 stalls. This serves as the center where all kinds of produce throughout the municipality are being traded and sold.\n\nThe Strategic Agriculture and Fisheries Development Zone or SAFDZ areas comprise about 16,695.52 hectares in total, or 59 percent of the total land area of Pinamalayan (Map Q). These are made up of areas utilized for irrigated rice, non-irrigated rice, inland fishponds, mangroves, open grasslands, and other agricultural areas. Furthermore, the other agricultural areas are used mainly for planting of fruit-bearing trees such as coconuts and bananas, among others.\n\nBarangay Sabang has the most number of lands utilized for SAFDZ with a total area of around 3,884.87 hectares while barangay Wawa has the least area with a total of 4.85 hectares. The land utilization per barangay is shown in Table EC-8.\n\nA total of 2,291.10 hectares of Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) Areas were distributed throughout the municipality and these are found in 31 barangays (Map S). However, it was found out that some of these CARP lands, with a total of 1,090 hectares, are situated in areas with equal to or greater than 18 percent slope as well as in forestlands. Approximately 777 hectares are located in areas with 18 percent slope and above while 310 hectares are present within forestlands. These identified areas are located in the barangays of Sabang, Marayos, Inclanay, Maliancog, Calingag, Rosario, Maningcol, Malaya, Buli, Sta. Isabel, Guinhawa, Pili, Banilad, and Ranzo.\n\nThere was a total of six agrarian related concerns raised during the years of 2014 to 2016. These dealt with land acquisitions and distribution, redocumentation of distributed land holdings, correction of surveyed lands, and cancellation of agrarian disputes. These are further summarized in Table EC-10, along with the location, beneficiaries, and extent of area concerned.\n\nRegarding fish catches in general, the data is showing continuous decline in production for three consecutive years. From 2014 to 2015, the combined volume of production from marine and inland sources decreased by 15 percent. In the succeeding year, a 12 percent decrease in production was derived. As to generated gross income that corresponds to volume of production in the same observed years, it was noted that from 2014 to 2015, the gross income per metric tons was maintained at 80,000 pesos. This shows steady market value despite 15 percent decrease in production. Aside from climate change, some problems have also been identified that have exacerbated the worsening fisheries production through the years. For example, fishing during spawning seasons is prevalent, as well as the practice of illegal fishing such as using fine-meshed nets and poaching of endangered species.\n\nHowever, from 2015 to 2016 where there is 26.45 percent decrease in fish production from 2014, it was noted that the value of fish per metric tons rose to 120,000 pesos. This result indicates that the invisible hand manipulating the market price is already working at this time. Thus, the law of supply and demand already applies. As the supply decreases with increasing demand or even at constant demand, the commodity price increases. Hence, if declining fish production persists in the succeeding years, a possible scenario would be the market price for fish may not be affordable for low income groups or may be hardly affordable for middle income groups.\n\nA total of 628 households or three percent of the total are engaged in fishing activities. These households are mostly coming from the nine coastal barangays of the municipality. Barangay Ranzo has the largest percent share of households at 22 percent. Fisherfolk are also affected by the unsustainability of fishing activities through the years. This situation calls for allocation of alternative livelihood for the affected population. Data regarding households engaged in fishing per barangay are further shown in Table EC-14."
