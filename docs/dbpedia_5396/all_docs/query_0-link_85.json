        "text": "Day 1: Porec\n\n(approx. 35 km, if you have time)\n\nIndividual arrival at your start hotel in Porec. If you arrive early we have a few suggestions for your first day in Croatia: either you visit the Brijuni islands by boat or the Limski channel, or you enjoy your day off by the sea or visit the hinterland of Porec. The Brijuni-islands are twelve smaller and 2 bigger islands; the main island Veli Brijun was used by the Yugoslav statesman Tito as summer residence. Today the islands are a National Park and only Veli Brijun is open to the public. Going by boat to the fjord-alike Limski channel you might be lucky and see some dolphins. The Limski-channel is National Park too and on the coast you find mussels and oyster farms.\n\nDay 2: Porec – Rovinj\n\n(approx. 55 km)\n\nHave a last view over the picturesque seaport on Istria’s west coast before you leave to Rovinj. The city is surrounded in the west and the south west by the Adriatic Sea. Afar the high bell tower of the Euphemia Church built on the highest spot of Rovinj, greats you. Go ahead and if you like you can cycle to Zlatni rt (also known as Golden Cape), a peninsula, where you find a park in a nature reserve.\n\nDay 3: Rovinj – Pula\n\n(approx. 45 - 55 km)\n\nThe last day on your „expedition“ in Istria leads you to Pula on Istria’s south west point. Pula is the oldest town of Istria and its commercial and cultural centre. Enjoy the last day of your trip amongst various antiquities and the mighty Roman amphitheatre in the centre of Pula.\n\nBy car: Over the Tauern motorway to Villach and over the border crossing Arnoldstein to Udine and Trieste. From Trieste on the motorway to Koper (toll charge!) and over the E751 through Slovenia to Croatia – Porec (toll charge!).\n\nBy train: Via Salzburg and Villach to Trieste (Trieste centrale). Timetable available on: www.deutschebahn.de, www.oebb.at,www.trenitalia.com.\n\nBy plane: Low Cost flights to Ronchi dei Legionari airport (Trieste) or Pula. Good connections with airport shuttle from Ronchi Legionari airport to Trieste. From there you continue by bus.\n\nBy boat: From Venice to Porec with Venezia Lines - www.venezialines.com."
