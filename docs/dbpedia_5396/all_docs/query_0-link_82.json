        "text": "ESPN Fantasy Projection : Rostered in just 1.6% of ESPN Fantasy leagues ahead of Week 1 last season, Nacua proved to be the waiver wire's most generous offering. The first-year slotman immediately filled injured Cooper Kupp's shoes to lead the team in routes, targets, catches and yards, while regularly dazzling after the catch (639 YAC, WR5). Nacua's volume dipped after Kupp returned, but the BYU product continued to churn, setting both the NFL rookie receiving yards and receptions records. Given Kupp's age and injury history, Nacua is a good bet to remain Matthew Stafford's most productive pass-catcher again in 2024. He's a solid fantasy WR1."
