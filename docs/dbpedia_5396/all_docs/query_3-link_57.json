        "text": "Your Height and Weight\n\nThe first thing is to confirm your size. This will allow you to select the appropriate Dogi size. Our recommendations consider future Dogi shrinkage.\n\nSometimes, especially when your weight is over your ideal weight, it is better to select a half size larger. Remove the hundreds digit of your size, and if your weight exceeds this figure, we recommend a larger size. (E.g., your height is 170 cm and your weight 75 kg we advise to opt for half a size larger.)\n\nWe indicate the three most important measurements for all models to limit mistakes in the size choice. Measure your current Dogi for comparison (do not forget that a new Dogi will shrink about 2 to 3 cm after washing).\n\nWe recommend paying extra attention to the maximum recommended size. A few extra kg/pound (2 ~ 3) is not an issue, and the final fit will also depend on your body shape (muscle ratio), but if you feel you might be above the recommendation, please contact us before placing your order as there is a great chance it will not fit.\n\nA & B Sizes - Thin & Wide Sizes"
