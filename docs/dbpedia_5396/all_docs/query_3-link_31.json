        "text": "Virtually any multivariate dataset can be analysed using PRIMER. The unifying feature is that data may be reduced to an appropriate triangular matrix of resemblances among every pair of samples. Clustering and ordination techniques are then able to display relationships among samples, and robust permutation tests are used to test hypotheses.\n\nEcological data are typically abundances of species (counts, biomass, cover or presence/absence) from fundamental or environmental studies, including biological monitoring. Though assemblage data are a primary focus, the package is equally applicable to other types of multivariate data, such as genetic nucleotides (e.g., SNPs), allele frequencies, amino acids or proteins. PRIMER also caters for physical or chemical variables, which can be analysed in their own right or used to examine co-variation of biotic changes with physico-chemical conditions."
