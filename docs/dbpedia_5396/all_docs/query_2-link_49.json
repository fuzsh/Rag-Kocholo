        "text": "Adopt a Classroom Initiative\n\nWhat is Adopt a Classroom?\n\nIt’s a special opportunity for a group of individuals to collectively support an entire classroom of St. Marcus scholars with a personal investment of $2,500 each.\n\nWith approximately 30 students in a classroom, investments of $2,500 from 30 individual supporters will fund a year of education for an entire classroom of scholars!\n\nWhy $2,500?\n\n$2,500 represents the gap between state funding and the actual cost to educate one St. Marcus scholar per year. Fulfilling that gap ensures that every student receives the highest levels of academic instruction; access to technologies, tools, and resources for digital learning; and crucial enrichment through arts and physical education, athletics, field trips, and more. The $2,500 commitment can be fulfilled in a single payment OR monthly installments - it’s up to you!\n\nWhat do classroom partners receive?\n\nAs a classroom partner, you’ll follow these scholars through their school year, witnessing how your generosity directly impacts them. You’ll receive:\n\nPersonal pen pal correspondence from individual classroom scholars\n\nInvitations to visit the classroom twice a year\n\nAn invitation to a mid-year Virtual Event\n\nE-Newsletters on classroom happenings and other learning highlights that YOU are making possible!\n\nThe 2024-2025 St. Marcus school year is starting soon, and we are excited to launch this year’s Adopt a Classroom program!\n\nReady to help scholars SOAR?\n\nJoin Adopt a Classroom in 2 Steps!\n\nSTEP 1: YOUR INFORMATION"
