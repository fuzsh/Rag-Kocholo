        "text": "“Food has power. It could inspire, astonish, shock, excite, delight, and impress. It had the power to please me.”\n\nAnthony Bourdain\n\nWith all travel comes exploring the culinary delights each destination has to offer. It is often the highlight of a trip. This, though, only happens if you leave your comfort zone and find a little bravery. To have an adventurous palate takes some guts, especially in certain cultures. It is about partaking in what is important to the region you are visiting.\n\nMany cultures and people speak through their food. It is a sense of pride and is often steeped with tradition. Food is intricately tied to a country’s history. If we listen, that food speaks to us, and we learn. As we travel, we are there to see the sights and, most notably, to experience the culture and the people. Without food, we miss a vital element of who these people are. We miss part of their voice, their story, and their spirit. Croatian cuisine was precisely that, and it was one we had not prepared for.\n\nIn our trip planning, we had not heard much about Croatian food. We had incorrectly assumed it would be lots of meat and potatoes. It was not that we heard the food was terrible; we had not heard anything. In our ignorance, we did not research what to expect from the food. That was a mistake, as it was beyond anything we anticipated.\n\nThere was a hint\n\nThere was a story in the news just before we left. Magic Johnson, the legendary basketball player, had just returned from Croatia. He was traveling on a yacht to various cities, a bit out of our league. Upon returning, he spoke of Croatian cuisine. “The food was fantastic, and the country was just beautiful.” He went on to share that it was some of the best meals he had ever had. I bet he has eaten at many notable places based on his wealth. This was intriguing, but it was dismissed as we assumed he was likely exaggerating. He wasn’t on any level; we could not agree with him more!\n\nCroatian Cuisine, a Cultural Melting Pot\n\nWe were in awe from our first meal in Zagreb until our last dinner in Dubrovnik 14 days later. A diverse variety of foods and traditions come from the many surrounding countries and are infused into Croatia’s style. Croatia has existed since ancient times; its roots also travel back there. It was at a crossroads of many aggressors and was on a major merchant route that brought many spices and exposure to different cultures. There is early Slavic, along with a hint of Turkish, Hungarian, and Austrian, throughout the country. The various coastal regions have strong influences from the Venetians, Romans, and Greeks. This is obvious in every coastal city and small town.\n\nWith many other influences mixed in, you will consistently find something new. Croatia’s flavors never disappoint, and there is plenty to try. You will have no trouble finding something from simple snacks to decadent dinners. With excellent wine regions and many homegrown breweries, great beverages will accompany those meals. You will almost feel guilty eating and drinking so much until you remember how little you have spent. Don’t worry; it’s vacation anyway. You can splurge in Croatia, and it will barely dent your wallet except in Dubrovnik.\n\nTwo Distinct Regions\n\nThough some describe many subregions of cuisine, Croatian cuisine can be divided into two distinct zones: the north and the coast. The coast’s food encompasses lots of seafood, fish, and mussels, along with fresh seasonal vegetables. That said, a lot of meat, including beef, lamb, and pork, is found on the menu. The north region, predominantly the Istria region, has deep Italian roots.\n\nIstria was part of Italy until after WW2, when under the Allies Treaty of Peace with Italy, Istria and Dalmatia were given to the Nation of Yugoslavia. This caused a mass exodus in 1943, but the influence of Italians remains very strong. If you are near the coast in this region, you will find lots of pasta, meat, charcuterie, olive oil, truffles, and, of course, seafood.\n\nWhen we speak of haute cuisine, we all know those can come at a hefty price, and for the majority of us, budgeting is the name of the game while traveling. So, how do you get the whole culinary experience in Croatia if you have to watch every penny you spend? The answer is that you don’t. You will learn quickly that everything in Croatia is inexpensive, especially food and drinks. Because of this, you will have no issues splurging at times to experience all the foods you wish to try. From traditional, exotic, or simple treats, you only have to worry about what to try first with the incredible choices you see on the menu.\n\n*TIP*\n\nHave each person in your party choose separate dishes so that you can try as many different options as possible.\n\nOur Experience with Croatian Food\n\nOver our years of travel, some of the best interactions with the locals are around food. It is always amazing how locals light up when you ask what they suggest. What is traditional? What is your favorite? A dower waiter, all of a sudden, becomes engaged. This was the case at our first meal in Croatia.\n\nWe had landed late in the morning in Zagreb, but it was too early to get a room, and except for some airplane food, we were pretty hungry. When we inquired about a place with traditional local food at the hotel, they did not hesitate and said Sofras. It was a Bosnian restaurant to the core. It was not as Croatian as we had hoped, and we commented on that. They said it is trendy and loved by the locals. They advised us that Bosnia influences Croatian cuisine. The décor and the servers were in full traditional dress. We immediately got the sense this is not a place many tourists visit.\n\nBreaking down barriers\n\nOur server seemed less than friendly when we first sat down until we started asking him what he recommended. We basically let him pick for us as we didn’t even know what some of the menu’s English meant. The menu was huge, too. He even picked out the beer. Our expectations were not high, but that was the beginning of an array of delectable experiences that lasted the next 14 days.\n\nBosnian/Slavic cuisine is strongly influenced by the Ottomans, which is quite prominent in mainland Croatia. Certain core aspects are featured: flavorful, colorful bell peppers, cabbage, grilled meat, especially lamb and beef, meat pies, flatbread called somun, beans, cucumbers, carrots, and onions. The flavors use a lot of paprika and garlic. They have one of the most delicious creams called pavlaka and kajmak, which they pour over their meat pies.\n\nSofra’s\n\nOn our Second Night in Zagreb, we wanted something more reflective of mainland Croatian cuisine. We found ourselves at Vinodol in the main restaurant district of Zagreb. The hotel suggested it, and the reviews seemed to back that up. The menu was extensive and diverse but representative of much we saw in the weeks ahead. Here are a few of the choices from the menu.\n\nVinodol\n\nOnto the Istria Pennisula\n\nIstria brought us culinary delights we never imagined we would experience, and it started with our very first meal. Lunch in the tiny medieval village of Boljun in this little tavern called Boljunski Konoba set the tone for this incredible region. Our first exposure to truffles was here, and we would repeat it at almost every meal over our time in this marvelous region.\n\nTruffles from Croatia have gained enormous respect. They remained a well-kept secret for the most part until recently. With nearby nations such as Italy and France having such a reputation for truffles, Croatia stayed off the radar. Anthony Bourdain put Istria truffles on the map. Luckily, it is still a place where you can find these magnificent fungus tubers on a menu at meager prices.\n\nTruffles, especially white ones, sell for thousands of dollars a kilo and have an extremely short shelf life. Few can afford them, so we had never tried a real truffle, only truffled flavored oils. This was going to be a very rare and unique adventure.\n\nTruffle Heaven\n\nMotovun’s splendid medieval walled hill town is in the heart of truffle country. This is where trained pigs and dogs hunt in the Motovun forest for this hidden gem, the truffle. The forest is in the beautiful Mirna River Valley below the town. The climb up the steep hill is work, but the rewards are beyond worth the effort.\n\nWhile there, we had a meal of a lifetime, a Konoba Mondo. Our decision was based solely on Google reviews when it was time for lunch. The village was tranquil, with maybe four other tourists visiting. The restaurant was quite large, with two levels and a large outdoor patio dining area; it was just two additional guests and us. We wondered if it was the right choice. But then we saw a signed picture of Anthony Bourdain with the owner and some staff. It seemed a good choice at that point.\n\nAnd it was! It’s the best choice ever.\n\nThere are black and white truffles. Though still delicious, black truffles have a much longer season and a better shelf life and are not coveted comparatively. Black truffles are both cooked and used as a garnish. White truffles are unique and a rare treat with an abridged season and short shelf life. They are only used as a garnish. These rotten-looking fungi are incredibly pungent (that is how the dogs and pigs find them), with a musky, earthy aroma and a slight garlicky taste.\n\nMotovun Wonder\n\nFollowing how magical our trip was, it turned out White truffle season started that week. The restaurant had a special white truffle-only menu for the occasion. Every course had white truffles freshly shaved onto the dish. Maybe because it was so quiet, or their shelf life was ending, the white truffles kept coming. We were in awe. They were absolutely delicious!\n\nOur meal, which lasted a couple of hours, included craft beers, two appetizers covered in white truffles, two main courses covered in white truffles, two glasses of local wine, and a chocolate dessert covered in white truffles topped off with an espresso. No, the coffee was not covered in truffles and was compliments of the house. It was heaven, the meal, the drinks, the ambiance, and the service. What would that cost in the States? Probably three or four hundred dollars or even more, based on the volume of truffles we received. Our total was around $130. It is one of the most highly sought-after and coveted food items globally, and we could fully experience and afford it, too! Not only did we experience them in many dishes, but we had loads of them for a fraction of the price.\n\nKonoba Mondo\n\nTruffles Joined Us on the Rest of our Journey\n\nAfter we left Istria, we never saw truffles on the menu again as we went down the southern coast. In those few days in Istria, we had truffles for breakfast on eggs, for lunch on pasta, and for dinner on everything! Their smell will always be associated with incredible memories.\n\nBut the smell stayed with us in other ways,, too. Why? Joelle had purchased several black truffle salts for gifts. One rolled out of the bag, and when Ryan closed the trunk, it sliced the salt container. That rental car smelled like truffles for nine more days until we returned the vehicle. It was much more potent than the real thing. It seemed imprinted in our nasal passages long after we returned to the States.\n\nCroatian Cuisine from the Sea\n\nWe left Istria, heading down the coast. The food made a remarkable turn, and we were surprised and fascinated. This is where you will find Croatia’s large seafood selection. Seafood is usually a higher-priced item when dining out. However, even the fanciest seafood feast will find reasonable prices.\n\nShrimp, mussels, and their much-loved squid dishes will give you unique takes on standard seafood meals. Black seafood risotto is very popular in this region and is blackened with squid ink. Fresh seafood is on every menu. You can find the best variety along the vast coastline in all famous cities on the water, so you don’t need to worry about missing your chance to try some. There will be plenty of local delights caught daily. Always ask, as the staff will tell you what is fresh and what is not.\n\nNo matter how simple or fancy the restaurant, the presentation was beautiful. At times a work of art. They take enormous pride in their presentation.\n\nOur Big Splurge\n\nWe try to enjoy one higher-end meal during each trip. Joelle is drawn to Michelin-starred restaurants and has been to four in her life, so it is a rare event. Ryan has been to one. We did not even look for any in Croatia, but one night in Zadar, we visited this lovely restaurant on the waterfront the hotel suggested. They had this fascinating Chef’s seven-course dinner that intrigued us.\n\nWe went for it with some lovely wine and had a fantastic meal that was our Chef’s masterpiece. The plating of each course was so spectacular you felt bad eating it. The seven courses didn’t even include dessert, but in the end, they brought us both a beautiful one as a special treat at no cost. That was our one significant expense (it was less than a meal at Ruth Criss’s house, though), but since our overall food budget was dramatically lower than we expected, we still came way under budget. It was an exceptional example of the wonder of Croatian cuisine.\n\nRestaurant Kornat\n\nHearty Croatia Cuisine\n\nSome more popular dishes found everywhere in our travels were risotto, gnocchi, beef, and lamb. Depending on where you go and what you get, risotto and lamb are the more pricey items on menus. Those dishes were abundant across Croatia and had much lower prices than we usually see. Ryan made the most of that. Those dishes are rich, hearty, and in fair to generous portions. In Pula, we ate at a popular local restaurant in a residential neighborhood. We allowed our attentive server to pick out our meal, which was a ton of meat. There was a lot left behind. We never left a meal hungry.\n\nThis is a fun story: As we left that place and were the only non-Croats in there, our server stopped and offered each of us a complimentary Grappa shot. Three glasses of grappa appeared, and our fun, joyful server joined us to the word Zivjeli, cheers in Croatian. These are moments that make the trip extra memorable.\n\nCroatian Fast Food\n\nIn our travels, we noticed that there seemed to be only two kinds of “fast food” places in Croatia: pizza and sandwiches. You can’t turn a corner without seeing an Italian place or, at a minimum, having it on the menu at almost any place you eat. We didn’t give it much thought at first, but as we descended the Dalmatia coast, it was hard not to notice they were everywhere, and many locals seemed to partake.\n\nAt first, we were like, well, we can get pizza at home. It took us until halfway through the trip in Trogir that we decided to try this dominant dish. Oh my, that was a treat. Ryan will say it was hands down the best pizza he has ever had, and he has been to Italy. The setting didn’t hurt, sitting on the water in an ancient medieval town, but it was incredible pizza. Italy remains very prominent in Croatian cuisine, especially along the Dalmatia coast.\n\nWant to learn more about magnificent Croatia? Check out our\n\nCroatia Travel Guide\n\nRecommendations\n\nSo, what should you eat or avoid during your Croatian visit? Well, personally, like always, you should try everything. Be adventurous and get out of your comfort zone. We have tried so many new things and loved almost everything. Try the fancy, the odd, the local favorite, and cheap dive or street food. Order different things and share them with your travel companions. If you don’t like something, you aren’t going to lose out on a lot of money.\n\nRemember to look for the local treats and specialty dishes from each town you visit. Ask your hotel, the museum staff, or anyone if they aren’t busy. Strike up a conversation with where and what they recommend. If you see a line in a local bakery, pop in and see what they are buying.\n\nTake advantage of the low prices and taste everything that Croatia’s diverse culinary palate offers. Wash everything down with the local drinks, which are also very reasonably priced. We are confident that you won’t be disappointed, and it won’t break your budget.\n\nWhere to stay in Croatia\n\nThere are many great options throughout the country. Whether you are on a budget or seeking luxury, you will find it all. There are lots of homes for rent, too. Do your research and seek places where you will get a more authentic experience.\n\nIt is important to price out accommodations on various sites. Expedia is a US-based company, whereas Booking.com is Europe-based. Not all properties appear on both, so it is ideal to check both out. Our personal first choice is Booking.com. If the establishment has a website, check the price there as well. Click the link below to check out hotels and vacation homes in the area. It may be just the motivation you need to start planning that next grand adventure.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nExplore beyond your comfort zone; that phrase goes well when it comes to the culinary offerings at a destination you are visiting. Ask for what they are best known for and what they are proud of. We often ask what is most popular with the locals. What is unique to this region? It is remarkable how they light up when you show interest in their culture. We have seen servers not engaged but become excited. At times, even the chef comes out to see what we think.\n\nFood is intricately tied to culture. Seek authenticity and traditional experiences; they will enhance every aspect of your travels. They will make for some of the most memorable moments, and your palate will surely thank you.\n\n© 2024 Wanderers Compass All Rights Reserved\n\nCheck out Dining Abroad: A Cultural Quest to learn more about making the most of your dining experiences when traveling abroad.\n\nOur Croatian Cuisine Photo Gallery\n\nOur Top Recommended Travel Products and Services\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nSquaremouth.com\n\nOur favorite travel insurance site!\n\nWe could not be stronger advocates of being well-insured—not just for the little stuff but for the big things like medical emergencies.
