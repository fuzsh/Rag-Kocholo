        "text": "As we kick off our series documenting this year's most expensive wines, we turn to Sauvignon Blanc. Often synonomous with great value wines from New Zealand, Chile and other cool white hotspots, in this list we look at the rare pricey juggernauts that rule at the other end of the spectrum.\n\nUnlike the fresh citrusy summer wines that wash down nice with a fresh crunchy salad, these Sauvignon Blancs are rich, complex and flinty – sometimes even smoky and – unlike their fresh affordable and ever so affable alter-egos – come in at quite the price.\n\nRelated stories: The World's Most Expensive New Zealand Wines The World's Most Expensive Australian Wines The World's Most Expensive Rhône Wines\n\nAlthough the vast majority hail from the grape variety's ancient country of birth, first up is an American Allstar, and there's no prizes for guessing who.\n\nThe World's Most Expensive Sauvignon Blancs on Wine-Searcher:\n\nWine Name Score Ave Price Screaming Eagle Sauvignon Blanc 93 $3705 Louis-Benjamin - Didier Dagueneau Pouilly-Fume Asteroide 97 $1743 Louis-Benjamin - Didier Dagueneau Pouilly-Fume Clos du Calvaire 95 $1465 Louis-Benjamin - Didier Dagueneau Memento Mori 96 $1234 Pavillon Blanc du Chateau Margaux 94 $327 Louis-Benjamin - Didier Dagueneau Silex 92 $222 Domaine Vacheron Sancerre 'L'Enclos des Remparts' 93 $216 Louis-Benjamin - Didier Dagueneau Sancerre 'Le Mont Damne' 91 $188 Lail Vineyards Georgia Sauvignon Blanc 93 $176 Nicolas Barbou Utopie Creative 92 $163\n\nSwooping in to claim top dollar is none other than Screaming Eagle which led the troop last year. However, back then it came in at an astonishing $4421, this year – it's had quite the climb-down – plummeting to $3705. It's still big money, don't get us wrong, but even Napa royalty are working out there's only so much even the wealthiest will pay for Sauvignon Blanc.\n\nJeff Leve of The Wine Cellar Insider writes of the 2013 vintage: \"Fresh-squeezed grapefruit is at the core of this wine from the nose, through the finish. Add in fresh flowers, honeydew melon and green apple, with refreshing acidity and you get the picture.\" Others who have the luxury of tasting this wine agree, and the great white scores an impressive aggregate of 93 points.\n\nNumber two sees a return to the grape's ancestral homeland with the Louis-Benjamin - Didier Dagueneau Pouilly-Fume Asteroide which was – again – in second place last year. The late great Didier Dagueneau – with his wild Dionysian hair – was passionate about producing the peak of Pouilly Fumé Sauvignon Blanc, and his family carry on his work.\n\nThe star-spangled Asteroide made by Dagueneau's son, Louis-Benjamin, has received plenty of stellar reviews – scoring an aggregated critic score of 97 points. Although last year, it sat at $1785, this year it's climbed down slightly to $1743.\n\nIn third spot is another wine from Dagenau, the Pouilly-Fumé Clos du Calvaire. Although it failed to make the list last year, it's come back this year with an average price of $1465. Adorned with a Celtic cross, the Clos du Calvaire continues to impress the critics with an aggregated critic score of 95.\n\nNumber four is yet another Dagenau wonder – the Louis-Benjamin - Didier Dagueneau Memento Mori. The wine – first released in 2018 – is Louis-Benjamin's tribute to his father.\n\nThe name plays on a macabre trope that has been used in some form or another since antiquity – a stark reminder that we all must die. With an aggregated critic score of 96 points, that cheery little memo comes in at a whopping $1234.\n\nIn fifth place sees a break from the Dagueneau set with the Pavillon Blanc du Château Margaux. The only white Bordeaux to make an appearance on this list, it also appeared on last year's list where it had a price tag of $325. This year, not much has changed with the price still largely the same bar one or two dollars.\n\nThe wine still scores glowing reviews, with Wine-Searcher's Master of Wine, David Allen describing it as having \"blackcurrant leaf, passionfruit perfume and saline touches. The palate is very pungent, with more powerful saline notes over passionfruit flavor.\" Other critics agree, scoring an aggregate of 94 points.\n\nNumber six sees a return to Dagueneau with the Silex at $222. Instantly recognizable by the diamond piece of flint – or silex – printed on the bottle, the wine is seen as one of the pinnacle examples of Sauvignon Blanc, despite its modest classification as Vin de France.\n\nFalstaff described the wine as having a \"delicate flinty touch, smoky minerality, white flower nuances, hints of ripe gooseberries, red berry nuances of currant, soft notes of blossom honey, fresh meadow herbs in the background\". Other critics agree, scoring it an aggregate of 92 points.\n\nLucky number seven is the Domaine Vacheron Sancerre L'Enclos des Remparts, Domaine Vacheron is one of the leading producers of Sancerre in the Loire.\n\nThe estate is known for its world-class biodynamic Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir made from hand-picked grapes. The silex soils – a combination of limestone and clay topped with flint – give the wines a distinct saline mineral smokiness.\n\nThe L'Enclos des Remparts has been described by Wine-Searcher's own senior wine specialist Jitka Auermüllerová as \"powerful, rich and hedonistic expression of SB. Mineral, structured and creamy palate with a touch of chewiness … Finishes long, with smoky hints. Dense, almost baroque style.\"\n\nOther critics agree, scoring the wine an aggregate of 93 points, and – at $216 – creeps closer to the realms of affordability.\n\nNumber eight sees a return to the Dagueneau stable with the Sancerre Le Mont Damne. A rare Sancerre among the estate's usual Pouilly-Fumé and Vin de France, Le Mont Damne has won rave reviews. Scoring an aggregate of 91 points, alongside a $188 price tag, Le Mont Damne may be damned but it certainly delivers.\n\nNumber nine sees a last hurrah for Napa with the Lail Vineyards Georgia Sauvignon Blanc. Lail Vineyards was founded in 1995 by Robin Lail, hailing from a strong Napa winemaking background – Lail's father, John Daniel Jr was the proprietor of Inglenook Winery.\n\nThe Georgia Sauvignon Blanc frequently does well with the critics. Scoring an aggregate of 93 points for a pricey but not extortionate $176 – the wine's a relative bargain, especially when compared to the other Napa Sav in the mix.\n\nLast is the Nicolas Barbou Utopie Creative. With time spent in both Burgundy and New Zealand, Nicolas Barbou has brought his winemaking skill back to his native Loire. His vision is one that both harnesses and brings creativity, art and wine together, as illustrated by the Utopie Créative.\n\nWith an aggregated critics score of 92 points, and a price tag of $163, the Utopie Créative wraps up this year's most expensive Sauvignon Blancs.\n\nFrom Napa's four figures to a relatively humble finale from the Loire Valley, this year's most expensive Sauvignon Blanc goes for gold and, fortunately, for much of it you don't need a crazy amount of money. Unless – that is – you're catching the great white eagle."
