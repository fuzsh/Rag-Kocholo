        "text": "Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in food systems, straining overall stability and resilience. The increasing frequency and severity of weather events resulting from climate change affect food production, processing, and market prices. For example, rising temperatures, rainfall variability, and increased drought alter planting and harvesting calendars, reduce crop yields, and increase the volatility of food prices.\n\nTo understand the climate resilience of food or agricultural systems, a “value chain” offers a useful model. An agricultural value chain refers to the people and activities involved in bringing a basic agricultural product, such as maize, vegetables, or cotton, from the field to the end consumer (1). This includes procurement of inputs, production, processing, packaging, and distribution, as well as value-adding activities such as storage, transportation, processing into secondary goods, wholesale, retail, and food service. The value chain model can help to develop solutions to increase resilience by identifying inefficiencies and vulnerabilities.\n\nThough agricultural value chains vary with commodity and location, they share many similarities in terms of their exposure to increasingly frequent and increasingly extreme weather events related to climate change. Extreme temperatures, pests, disease, drought, or flooding can damage agricultural operations of many types through the required infrastructure, activities, and inputs. Global yields of staple crops such as wheat, rice, maize, and soybean could decrease with increasing temperature (2). Agricultural production is particularly critical to understand as it underpins all subsequent activities in the value chain.\n\nSince climate and weather can directly affect the operations, suppliers, purchasers, or market prices for an actor in a value chain, diversifying operations can reduce exposure to these climate-related risks, which can increase resilience and adaptive capacity along with anticipating future risks and increasing the capacity to absorb instabilities (3). By pricing risk, insurance can support those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change by promoting continuity and stability and inhibiting short-term recovery strategies that undermine resilience to future shocks.\n\nBy enabling services that enhance the ability of actors in the value chain to manage risks and improve their adaptive capacity, technologies can significantly improve the resilience of agricultural value chains (4,5,6). For example, precision agriculture or early-warning systems can improve the efficiency and resilience of production, leading to increased farmer incomes. Refrigeration units or optimized transportation networks can reduce post-harvest losses. The proliferation of mobile phones in emerging markets (4), including smartphones (7), has given many farmers access to digital climate-related information and targeted advisories, as well as financial and business tools (8). In 2016, across 69 examined countries, 295 million farmers out of more than 750 million had a mobile phone and 13 million had both a mobile phone and a mobile money account (9).\n\nThough various kinds of financial services can increase resilience, many smallholder farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face barriers to accessing finance. Financial technology (or FinTech) solutions can build adaptive capacity and improve risk management by facilitating planning and diversification, while enabling innovation and experimentation for adaptive management (4). Digital insurance solutions can also increase resilience across agricultural value chains. Parametric insurance, for example, which uses predetermined metrics to assess damage rather than conducting time-intensive post-event assessments, can allow for faster capital deployment, helping individuals recover faster and improving the coverage of risks traditionally excluded from the claims processes, such as food spoilage and fluctuations in crop yields (10). Challenges to implementing parametric insurance include verifying the quality of data used to trigger payouts and basis risk, which is the potential difference between a policyholder’s loss and the payout received.\n\nFinally, market information systems can enhance transparency and price discovery, building stronger links among actors in the value chain. By using such systems to match buyers and sellers, actors can improve their income and use market signals to diversify their operations and thereby reduce the effects of climate-related shocks.\n\nInvestments to increase agricultural resilience through technology to climate-related shocks can:\n\nincrease access to enabling technologies such as climate- or market-information systems with clear, real-time information to reduce sensitivity and exposure to climate-related risk, as well as digital tools to build adaptive capacity through planning;\n\nincrease access to financial services to improve resilience, including insurance products, without burdening or indebting vulnerable stakeholders;\n\nincrease the adoption of drought- and heat-tolerant crops, weather- and disease-resistant livestock breeds that require fewer inputs and have higher yield stability; and\n\nexpand technologies both during and post-harvest that reduce exposure and sensitivity to drought, flooding, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events.\n\nThough climate change is a global problem, its effects are distributed unevenly. Similarly, while agricultural value chains are also global, there are diverse stakeholders, effects, and risks. Crop productivity is expected to decline in most of the world, particularly in tropical areas, which are home to most of the world’s poor and most food-insecure (22). Yields in Asia and Africa are expected to fall 8% by 2050 (22), which could be devastating to the smallholder farmers that generate approximately four-fifths of all food produced there (23). Increased frequency of severe weather events affects many agricultural enterprises, whether through increased volatility of market supply and demand or other cost burdens. Given the variation in climate-related effects and the diversity of actors within agricultural value chains, investors should carefully consider the local characteristics of climate risk when determining the potential for a given technology or innovative financial product to increase resilience. To effectively understand outcomes for stakeholders, investors may need to consider not only the adoption of a technology or product but also the nature of its use.\n\nPula: In 2021, Pula (27), a Kenyan startup that specializes in digital and agricultural insurance, announced that it closed a Series A investment of USD 6 million, led by the Pan-African early-stage venture capital firm, TLcom Capital, with participation from nonprofit Women’s World Banking. The financing will help Pula scale up its operations in existing markets across Africa. Pula had previously received USD 1 million in seed investment from Rocher Participations, Accion Venture Lab, Omidyar Network, and others in 2018.\n\nFounded in 2015, Pula delivers agricultural insurance and digital products to help smallholder farmers reduce their vulnerability to climate risks, improve their resilience, and increase incomes over time. The company focuses on smallholder farmers who need relatively smaller insurance premiums compared to traditional insurance products. The firm’s technology and data solutions use machine learning, crop-cut experiments, and data on weather and loss to develop products catered to various risks. In order to increase uptake and distribution, the firm works with banks that require insurance for loan acceptance.\n\nIngressive Capital: In 2021 (28,29), Ingressive Capital, a venture capital fund, announced an undisclosed amount of funding in Complete Farmer, an Ag-Tech company founded in 2017 and based in Ghana. Complete Farmer is leveraging technology to digitize the agriculture value chain by building a demand-driven platform to match buyers with local farmers. Its platform currently supports over 2,000 acres of farmland across six regions in Ghana, with expansion plans in Kenya and Togo.\n\nFarmers and other actors in these areas face a number of climate risks, including post-harvest loss and spoilage from increasing temperatures, limited capacity to anticipate extreme weather and climate risks, and limited market information hindering their ability to generate income. Complete Farmer helps mitigate these risks by enabling buyers to establish efficient supply chains and equipping sellers with knowledge and tools to meet demand. The platform is designed to reduce inefficiencies in value chain interactions, facilitating more efficient transactions between parties. The company provides offtake for farmers along with transparent pricing, limiting post-harvest losses after offtake through transportation and cold storage in an improvement upon the previously existing distribution system. The platform also connects farmers with vendors for inputs, along with guidance and training on farming protocols and best agronomic practices, as well as weather forecast information."
