        "text": "ACI Marina Pula was built in one of the most famous places in the port of Pula, near the famous arena and within walking distance of the old town. The marina’s central building, called “the cake”, is located on an artificial island about 100 meters from the coast and is connected to it with a stable fixed pier. Four floating piers, designed to accommodate vessels up to 18 meters in length extend radially from the central building.\n\nSince the entire marina was built at the beginning of the development of nautical and marina tourism in Croatia, after twenty years of operation Adriatic Club International decided to complete the modernization of the marina.\n\nThe worn and weak pontoon elements were replaced by Marinetek Heavy Duty pontoons.\n\nThe dock anchorage is equipped with a new anchor system with chains and concrete blocks and the anchoring with a standard Mediterranean mooring quarter.\n\nMarinetek completed a complete reconstruction of the marine portion of the marina, as well as the replacement of the power and water supply systems for all vessels in the marina."
