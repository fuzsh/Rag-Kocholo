        "text": "How does Oracle Database Licensing Work?\n\nHow is Oracle database licensing structured? Oracle database licensing hinges on the following:\n\nThe infrastructure, number of processor cores, and number of users.\n\nThe two main license models are processor and named user Plus.\n\nFor the processor model, physical core counts matter, but Oracle’s virtualization rules apply to virtual servers.\n\nOracle offers two main database editions: Enterprise and Standard.\n\nThe enterprise edition is core-based with 18 add-ons termed enterprise edition options or management packs.\n\nThe standard edition is socket-based. Different editions have varying user minimums and deployment rules.\n\nUnderstanding Oracle Database Licensing\n\nHow does Oracle Licensing Work?\n\nOracle db licensing can be complex, given the wide range of products and the different ways they can be used.\n\nHowever, some basic principles apply to most Oracle licenses:\n\nLicense Types: Oracle primarily offers two types of licenses – Named User Plus and Processor. The Named User Plus license is based on the number of users accessing the software, while the Processor license is based on the number of processor cores in the servers where the software is installed.\n\nOracle License Metrics: These are the units by which a license is measured (e.g., the number of users, processors, etc.). The metric depends on the type of license.\n\nOracle Databases Licensing Models\n\nHere are some examples of Oracle database software:\n\nOracle Enterprise Edition is the most expensive version of Oracle database software, core-based licensing with an add-on that triggers additional licenses called database options and management packs.\n\nOracle Database Standard Edition 2: The latest version of Oracle Standard Edition can only be licensed on servers with at least 2 CPUs or clusters with 2 CPU sockets. It is important to note that the cluster limitation only applies if you run RAC. Starting from 19c, RAC has been removed from Standard Edition 2.\n\nOracle Standard Edition can only be licensed on servers or clusters with a maximum of 4 processor sockets. It can no longer be purchased.\n\nOracle Standard Edition One is less expensive than the Standard Version. Only available for servers with a maximum of 2 processor sockets. This product can no longer be purchased. Read more in our SE One Licensing Guide.\n\nOracle enterprise manager. The Database Control and Grid Control features are free with this Oracle DB version. However, management packs must be purchased and licensed to monitor additional users and CPUs. OEM is included for free in the Oracle database. However, only some features are free; others require a license.\n\nWhat needs to be licensed?\n\nIn the context of Oracle software, it’s vital to understand the scope of licensing requirements:\n\nAll Environments: Every server where the Oracle processor is installed or running must be licensed. This includes the production environment and test, development, and disaster recovery environments.\n\nOracle Processor Licensing\n\nUnderstanding Oracle Processor Licensing\n\nWhen It’s Used: Oracle Processor Licensing is typically applied in scenarios where it’s difficult to count or identify individual users. This situation often arises in web-based applications where user tracking is challenging.\n\nCalculating Licenses\n\nLicense Determination: To calculate the required licenses, multiply the total number of processor cores by the core processor licensing factors. These factors are outlined in the Oracle Processor Table.\n\nContractual Reference: Always refer to the specific Oracle contract for detailed terms, as Oracle’s definition of a “processor” might differ from that of your hardware vendor.\n\nStandard Edition Licensing\n\nLicensing Model for Standard Editions: For Oracle Standard Edition and Standard Edition 2, the licensing count is based on sockets rather than cores. In the context of multi-chip modules, each chip is considered as one socket.\n\nLicensing All Processors\n\nComprehensive Licensing Requirement: If Oracle Software is installed or running on a server, all processors in that server must be licensed. This requirement extends to all cluster members and applies to remote mirroring or standby machines.\n\nProcessor Calculation\n\nCalculation Method: The total number of processor cores is multiplied by the core processor licensing factor to determine the processor license count.\n\nMulti-core Consideration: Each core must be accounted for in the licensing for multi-core chips. All fractional numbers are rounded up before multiplying by the core-licensing factor.\n\nProduct-Specific Nuances\n\nUnique Conditions Per Product: Each Oracle product may have specific licensing nuances. For example, in licensing Oracle Database Standard Edition, a processor is equated to an occupied slot, and in multi-chip modules, each chip counts as a single socket.\n\nIt’s crucial for organizations to comprehensively understand these licensing requirements to ensure compliance and avoid potential legal and financial repercussions. Oracle licensing can be complex, and the specifics can vary based on the product and deployment scenario.\n\nVirtualization Software & Partitioning\n\nOracle differentiates between hard and soft partitioning. If partitioning methods, including virtualization, are part of hard partitioning, only partitions created with Oracle software must be licensed.\n\nSoft partitioned servers, on the other hand, must be fully licensed. This includes any third-party software like VMWare.\n\nWhen to Consider Oracle Processor Licensing\n\nHere are two critical scenarios when Oracle Processor Licensing can be beneficial:\n\nLarge User Base: If many users access your system, it might be more cost-effective to license based on processors than users. For example, if you run a popular online service accessed by thousands of users, tracking and licensing each user can be cumbersome and expensive.\n\nFluctuating User Base: Processor Licensing can provide more flexibility if the number of users accessing your system changes frequently. For instance, running a retail website with traffic spikes during sale events would be easier to license based on processors rather than trying to account for each user during peak times.\n\nHowever, if your system has a small number of processors but is accessed by many users, Processor Licensing might not be the most cost-effective choice.\n\nTypical Use Case: Web-Based Applications\n\nOracle Databases for web-based applications are a common scenario for Processor Licensing.\n\nThis model allows you to run your web applications on Oracle Database without counting individual users or devices.\n\nSimplifying Licensing in Virtualized Environments\n\nProcessor Licensing can also simplify licensing in virtualized environments. Instead of tracking the number of users accessing each virtual machine, you can license based on the number of processors allocated to run the Oracle Database.\n\nThe Advantage of Processor Licensing\n\nOne of the main advantages of Processor Licensing is that it eliminates the need to count or track users.\n\nThis can save significant time and effort, especially in large organizations with many users. Instead, you focus on the number of processors in your system, which is typically more manageable and stable.\n\nWhat is Oracle Named User Plus Licensing\n\nOracle Named User Plus Licensing is a model that allows you to pay per user. However, the definition of a ‘user’ in this context extends beyond human users to any end node interacting with an Oracle database.\n\nUser Minimums Based on Database Edition\n\nThe minimum number of user licenses required depends on the Oracle Database edition:\n\nEnterprise Edition: Requires a minimum of 25 Named User Plus licenses per processor, or the total number of users using the Oracle Database, whichever is greater.\n\nStandard Edition 2: Allows for a minimum of 10 users per server.\n\nLicensing Considerations\n\nHere are some key points to consider when licensing Named User Plus:\n\nNon-Human Operated Devices: All devices that connect to the Oracle Database must be licensed, even if humans do not operate them. For example, a server that automatically pulls data from the Oracle Database must be licensed.\n\nHuman-Operated Devices: All humans who use devices to connect to the Oracle Database need to be licensed. This includes users operating devices like barcode scanners or computers.\n\nMixed Usage: If both non-human-operated devices and human-operated devices are connected to the Oracle Database, all non-human devices and all human-operating devices must be licensed.\n\nNamed User Plus Licensing in Oracle\n\nNamed User Plus licensing in Oracle is a model that focuses on counting distinct users and devices accessing the Oracle Database.\n\nUnderstanding this licensing model is crucial for compliance and cost optimization.\n\nDetermining Who to Count\n\nHuman Users and Devices: The count includes human users and any devices or servers interacting with the Oracle Database.\n\nCase Study Example: Consider a scenario where a company has a web application interfacing with an Oracle Database.\n\nCounting Human Users: The licensing count must include everyone who accesses the Oracle Database via the web application. This means every employee, customer, or external partner uses the application.\n\nCounting Devices: In addition to human users, any server, device, or automated tool that makes requests to the Oracle Database must also be included. This might include application servers, batch-processing servers, or even IoT devices.\n\nKey Considerations\n\nComprehensive Counting: Ensure that all potential users and devices are accounted for. Overlooking any of these could lead to non-compliance with Oracle’s licensing agreements.\n\nDynamic Environments: In environments where user numbers fluctuate, careful monitoring and adjustment of the licensing count may be required.\n\nDirect and Indirect Access: Remember to count users who might indirectly access the database through another application or tool.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nCompliance: Adhering to Oracle’s licensing agreements is a legal obligation and crucial to avoid substantial penalties and audit costs.\n\nCost Management: Counting users and devices can prevent over-licensing and optimize licensing expenses.\n\nIn summary, determining the number of Named User Plus licenses requires thoroughly assessing all human users and devices that access the Oracle Database.\n\nOpting for Oracle Named User Plus (NUP) Licensing\n\nOracle Named User Plus (NUP) Licensing can be a suitable choice if operating in a closed environment with a small, easily countable number of users.\n\nFor instance, test and development environments often benefit from NUP licensing.\n\nAdvantages of NUP Licensing\n\nSpecific User Licensing: This model allows you to pay for a particular number of users accessing the system rather than the number of processors or machines. This can be beneficial if you have a small team of developers working on an Oracle database.\n\nCost-Effective for Small Environments: NUP licensing can be cost-effective for small environments with limited users. For example, a startup with a small development team might find NUP licensing more affordable than Processor Licensing.\n\nNegotiable Minimums: Oracle licensing minimums can sometimes be negotiated, which can help reduce costs. For instance, if you’re a small business with fewer than the minimum required users, you might be able to negotiate a lower minimum with Oracle.\n\nUpgrade Path: If you eventually outgrow NUP licensing or tracking your user population becomes too difficult, you can easily upgrade to Oracle Processor Licensing. This flexibility allows your licensing model to scale with your business.\n\nPotential Downsides of NUP Licensing\n\nUser Tracking: With NUP licensing, you need to keep track of your users to ensure compliance with the licensing agreement. This can be challenging if your user base fluctuates frequently.\n\nMultiplexing Software: Multiplexing software, like an application server, can be a typical “unknown” gateway to uncountable licensing populations, such as web users.\n\nThis can lead to compliance problems. For example, suppose a web application with thousands of users accesses your Oracle database. Tracking each user for NUP licensing can be difficult and potentially lead to licensing violations.\n\nUnderstanding Named User Plus – Licensing Minimums\n\nWhen you opt for Oracle NUP (Named User Plus) licensing, you must base your licensing on a minimum of 25 users per Oracle processor.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\nMinimum User Requirement: Even if you only have five users, you must purchase licenses for 25 users to meet the minimum requirement.\n\nHigher Number Rule: You must purchase licenses for the higher number, whether the actual number of users or the calculated minimum number.\n\nScenario:\n\nLet’s consider a company using Oracle Database Enterprise Edition with no EE options.\n\nThey have one server with eight cores. Although only ten employees use the system, they need to ensure they meet the minimum licensing requirements.\n\nThe server uses an Intel core with a license factor of 0.5.\n\nCalculate Oracle Processor Licenses: First, multiply the number of cores (8) by the license factor (0.5). This gives you 4 Oracle processor licenses.\n\nDetermine User Minimum: The user minimum per Oracle processor is 25 NUP per Oracle Processor.\n\nCalculate Required Licenses: Despite having only ten users, the company must purchase 100 licenses (4 x 25) to meet the minimum requirement.\n\nOracle Database Options and Packs\n\nOracle provides various options and packs that enhance the capabilities of its database products.\n\nThese options and packs offer additional features and tools that can help optimize database performance, improve management efficiency, and provide advanced analytics.\n\nOverview of Oracle Database Options and Packs\n\nOracle database options and packs are additional components that can be purchased to extend the functionality of your Oracle Database.\n\nThey are designed to meet specific needs and use cases, such as performance tuning, data compression, and advanced security.\n\nHere’s a brief overview of some critical options and packs:\n\nOracle Management Packs\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Edition Options\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Management Packs\n\nDetailed Explanation of Each Option and Pack\n\nOracle Management Packs\n\nOracle Management Packs offer a cost-effective solution for managing Oracle environments. They provide comprehensive tools for database management tasks such as performance diagnostics, tuning, space management, and backup and recovery.\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Edition Options\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Edition Options are designed to address the most demanding business and IT challenges.\n\nThey offer advanced capabilities in performance, availability, security, and compliance.\n\nThese options include Real Application Clusters (RAC), Partitioning, Advanced Compression, and Advanced Security.\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Management Packs\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Management Packs provide comprehensive solutions for managing Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.\n\nThey offer tools for change management, configuration management, and performance management, among others.\n\nUnderstanding these options and packs can help you customize your Oracle Database to meet your specific needs better and maximize the value of your Oracle investment.\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Edition Options Licensing\n\nOracle offers 18 different Oracle enterprise edition options products, each containing multiple features. These products are only available to license under Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.\n\nIf you use or enable these options on a Standard Edition database, you must license that database with Enterprise Edition.\n\nIt is essential to match the licenses and quantities for each option to ensure correct licensing while using Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Options. The following guidelines should be kept in mind:\n\nIf you purchase a license for one option, you should purchase licenses for all other options you use at the same level and quantity.\n\nAll Oracle Enterprise Products are licensed based on the number of cores in the system. Therefore, the more cores you have, the more expensive the licensing will be.\n\nIn 2023, the following Oracle products will exist on the Oracle price list.\n\nMultitenant\n\nRAC\n\nRAC One Node\n\nActive Data Guard\n\nPartitioning\n\nReal Application Testing\n\nAdvanced Compression\n\nAdvanced Security\n\nLabel Security\n\nDatabase Vault\n\nOracle OLAP\n\nTimesTen Application\n\nDatabase In-Memory\n\nDiagnostic Pack\n\nTuning Pack\n\nDatabase Lifecycle Management Pack\n\nData Masking and Subsetting Pack\n\nCloud Management Pack for Oracle Database.\n\nTo license Oracle Database Enterprise Edition options, you need to follow these steps:\n\nCount the number of physical cores in the server and cluster.\n\nMultiply the physical processor cores with the Oracle license factor to obtain the “Oracle processor” requirements.\n\nThe option license’s quantity and license metrics must match the database. Suppose you have 8 Enterprise Edition processors and are using partitioning in one of the databases running on that server. In that case, you must license the DB EE with the same quantity and metric as the Partitioning license.\n\nScenario:\n\nA company has a server with eight physical cores of Intel and is using the multitenant option on their Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. They need to ensure that they are appropriately licensed for this option.\n\nUsing the new core factor of 0.5 (intel) and the processor-to-core ratio of 2:1, the company calculates the number of required processor licenses as follows:\n\nThe number of cores (8) multiplied with license factor 0,5 = 4 Oracle processors\n\nIn addition, the company must license Oracle Database Enterprise Edition in the same way, with the exact quantities and metrics as the multitenant option.\n\nThey must purchase four licenses for the multitenant option and Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.\n\nTo avoid compliance issues, they ensure that the license and quantity metrics match the database.\n\nApplications and Environments\n\nOracle’s licensing models are determined by the type of product, the number of users, and the specific applications and environments in which the software is used.\n\nThis section will provide examples of how licensing works in different scenarios.\n\nApplications Licensing Environments Example\n\nLet’s delve deeper into the provided scenario to understand better the licensing environment for Oracle’s E-Business Suite (EBS).\n\nScenario Context\n\nApplication in Use: The company utilizes Oracle’s E-Business Suite, specifically the EBS Financials module.\n\nPurpose: This module primarily processes the company’s financial information.\n\nLicensing Model\n\nComponent Model by Application User Metric: The company has chosen to license EBS Financials based on the number of individual users who access the application. This is a common approach for enterprise applications where each user’s access can be clearly defined and counted.\n\nCustomization and User Roles\n\nCustomization Example: The company has tailored the EBS system to fit its unique business processes in this scenario. A notable customization is the modified invoice approval form.\n\nUser Role – Managers: The customized form is designed for managers responsible for reviewing and approving invoices.\n\nCounting Users for Licensing\n\nNumber of Users: Ten managers (Manager Users) interact with this customized feature of EBS Financials.\n\nLicensing Implication: In this specific case, the licensing fee for EBS Financials is based on these 10 Manager Users. Essentially, each manager who accesses the system to approve invoices counts towards the total number of licenses required.\n\nLicensing Multiplexing Environments Example\n\nMultiplexing in Oracle Licensing\n\nDefinition of Multiplexing: In Oracle’s context, multiplexing involves using hardware or software solutions to pool connections, reroute information, or simplify data movement between devices or systems.\n\nImpact on Licensing: It’s critical to note that using multiplexing techniques does not decrease the number of Oracle licenses required.\n\nLicensing Example: Banking Environment\n\nScenario Setup: Consider a banking scenario where employees manage account holders’ transactions and access information through web browsers. Account holders also access bank information through the bank’s website or Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).\n\nDatabase and Server Specifications:\n\nThe bank uses Oracle Database Enterprise Edition to store transaction data.\n\nThe database runs on a server equipped with two 24-core processors.\n\nEach core has a core factor of 0.5, as specified by Oracle.\n\nLicensing Based on Processor Capacity:\n\nIn this multiplexing environment, the licensing requirement is determined by the capacity of the processors in the server.\n\nThe number of end-users or devices accessing the database, whether through web browsers or ATMs, does not influence the number of licenses required.\n\nKey Takeaways for Licensing Multiplexing Environments\n\nProcessor-Based Licensing: Oracle’s licensing in multiplexed environments is predominantly based on the processor capacity rather than the number of users or devices.\n\nImportance of Accurate Calculation: Correctly calculating the required licenses based on processor capacity is crucial to ensure compliance and avoid potential legal and financial consequences.\n\nOracle Database Licensing Per Version\n\nRecent Changes: In recent years, Oracle has introduced licensing variations depending on the specific Oracle database version.\n\nVersion-Specific Differences:\n\nFor example, the Real Application Clusters (RAC) feature is no longer available in Oracle 19C Standard Edition.\n\nAnother notable change is the ability to run up to three Pluggable Databases (PDB) per Container Database (CDB) without needing an additional license in Oracle 19C and onwards.\n\nAttention to Detail: It’s essential to pay close attention to these subtle yet significant nuances in licensing terms for different versions of the Oracle database.\n\nUnderstanding these complex licensing requirements and their application in different scenarios, like multiplexing environments, is crucial for organizations using Oracle products.\n\nStaying informed about version-specific changes and nuances can help maintain compliance and optimize licensing costs.\n\nCalculating Oracle Database License Costs\n\nUnderstanding Oracle License Cost Calculation\n\nImportance: Accurately calculating Oracle license costs is vital for effective budgeting and maintaining compliance with Oracle’s licensing agreements. We will walk over how to calculate the Oracle license price.\n\nSimplified Example: Intel Xeon Processor\n\nScenario: Imagine a server with an Intel Xeon processor 9200, which has 16 cores and one processor.\n\nOracle’s Licensing Factor: Oracle has assigned a licensing factor 0.5 for Intel processors.\n\nCalculation Process:\n\nMultiply the number of cores (16) by the licensing factor (0.5) to obtain 8 Processor licenses.\n\nThus, 8 Processor licenses are required for this server.\n\nTotal Cost Estimation:\n\nIf each Oracle enterprise license costs $47,500, the total cost would be eight licenses x $47,500 per license = $380,000.\n\nScenario: Licensing a Cluster with Oracle Standard Edition 2 (SE2)\n\nCompany Scenario: A company uses a cluster of 3 nodes, each with two processors, and utilizes VMware for virtualization. They are running Oracle Standard Edition 2 (SE2).\n\nSE2 Licensing Model: Oracle SE2 is licensed per occupied CPU socket.\n\nLicense Requirement:\n\nEach node must be fully licensed with two processor licenses, for six processor licenses for the entire cluster.\n\nCost Calculation:\n\nMultiply the total number of processor licenses (6) by the cost per license ($17,500).\n\nThe total licensing cost for the cluster is six licenses x $17,500 per license = $105,000.\n\nOracle Database Standard Edition 2 Licensing\n\nOracle Database Standard Edition is licensed per CPU socket occupied.\n\nOracle Database Standard Edition has licensing limits on the server size upon which it can be deployed.\n\nOracle Database Standard Edition 2 may only be deployed on a server with a maximum of two processor sockets.\n\nYou may not use Enterprise Edition options such as diagnostic or tuning packs on a standard edition 2 database.\n\nIf licensing Oracle Database Standard Edition 2 NUP is calculated, 10 NUP per server is the licensing minimum.\n\nOracle Term license change\n\nThe license Term provides the timeline for the customer’s usage\n\nAs of September 1, 2020, Oracle has ended the availability of term licenses for all on-premise software except specific Oracle Technology products for 1-year Term only available; Oracle sales representative for more information. Existing customers paying support on their term licenses will remain supported through the end of their term.\n\nThe Oracle license list price for a term license is based on a specific percentage of the perpetual license price with one year at 20% of the list price: Exadata Storage Server Software, Oracle Active Data Guard, Oracle Advanced Compression, Oracle Advanced Security, Oracle Database Enterprise Edition, Oracle Database In-Memory, Oracle Database Standard Edition 2, Oracle Database Vault, Oracle Diagnostic Pack, Oracle Forms and Reports, Oracle GoldenGate, Oracle Internet\n\nApplication Server Enterprise Edition, Oracle Multitenant, Oracle OLAP, Oracle Partitioning, Oracle Real Application Clusters, Oracle Real Application Clusters One Node, Oracle Real Application Testing, Oracle SOA Suite for Oracle Middleware, Oracle Tuning Pack, Oracle Weblogic Server Enterprise edition, Oracle Weblogic Standard Edition, Oracle Weblogic Suite.\n\nNote that the list support price for term licenses is 22% of the list perpetual license fee.\n\nOracle Authorized Cloud Computing Environments\n\nCustomer can deploy their Oracle Technology programs licenses on two Authorized cloud providers: Amazon EC2 and RDS Microsoft Azure Platform.\n\nTo license Oracle Technology programs in the Authorized Cloud, customers are required to count the maximum available vCPUs of an instance type as follows:\n\nCount two virtual CPUs (vCPU) to 1 Oracle Processor license if multi-threading of processor cores is enabled, and one virtual CPU (vCPU) to 1 Oracle Processor license if multi-threading of processor cores is not enabled.\n\nSix Oracle Database Licensing Compliance Risks\n\nUnderstanding Oracle Database licensing compliance risks is crucial to avoid unexpected costs and legal issues.\n\nMisunderstanding Oracle Licensing Policies for Virtual Environments\n\nOracle’s licensing policy document distinguishes between two types of virtualizations: hard partitioning and soft partitioning.\n\nHard Partitioning: This allows you to limit the processors you license, for example, in a cluster or on a large server. This is also known as sub-capacity licensing.\n\nSoft Partitioning: Technologies where Oracle does not allow sub-capacity licensing, and you need to license the whole cluster or server. VMware is counted as soft partitioning.\n\nReasons for non-compliance can include:\n\nIt is not aware of Oracle licensing rules for the specific virtualization technology.\n\nMisunderstanding or misinterpreting Oracle soft partitioning policy document.\n\nIncorrect OS configuration in hard partitioning scenarios like IBM LPAR or Oracle OVM requires licensing the whole server.\n\nMisunderstanding Oracle Licensing Policy for Disaster Recovery\n\nAs a rule, if you have the Oracle binaries installed on a server, they must be licensed regardless of whether they are turned on or off.\n\nThe only exception is the 10-day rule or when testing your DR instances.\n\nNot Fulfilling Oracle Licensing User Minimums\n\nOracle database, both Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition, can be licensed with the processor or Named User Plus licensing.\n\nHowever, even if you only have a few users, you must apply the licensing user minimums per processor to that server.\n\nA few user minimums include:\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Edition – 25 user minimums per Oracle processor license.\n\nOracle Database Standard Edition 2 – 10 user minimums per server.\n\nOracle WebLogic Enterprise Edition – 10 users per Oracle processor license.\n\nWebLogic Suite – 10 users per Oracle processor license.\n\nUnknowingly Using Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Options Without a License\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Edition comes with 18 additional licensable options and management packs.\n\nIf used, these features would trigger additional licenses. For example, the Oracle Database Enterprise Edition license is $47,500 per processor.\n\nStill, the Oracle Database Multitenant option is licensed at $17,500 and, if used, would trigger additional licenses to match the number of Oracle Database EE licenses.\n\nUsage of Oracle Database EE Options on Standard Edition\n\nSome of the Oracle Database Enterprise Options can technically be used on Standard Edition databases, but this is not allowed from a license compliance perspective.\n\nIf discovered in an audit, you must upgrade to Enterprise Edition and apply the core factor licensing to purchase licenses for this usage.\n\nInstalling Oracle Database Standard Edition on a Too-Large Server\n\nOracle Database Standard Edition and Standard Edition 2 have different licensing limitations on the server type that is eligible to run them.\n\nIf you install any of these versions on a server with a capacity more than what is suitable, you must license that server with an Enterprise Edition license.\n\nOracle Licensing in Hyper V | Oracle licensing virtual servers\n\nUseful links to learn more about Oracle licensing.\n\nOracle Database Licensing https://www.oracle.com/assets/databaselicensing-070584.pdf\n\nOracle Partitioning (Virtualization) https://www.oracle.com/assets/partitioning-070609.pdf\n\nOracle Licensing Disaster Recovery https://www.oracle.com/assets/data-recovery-licensing-070587.pdf\n\nOracle Application Licensing https://www.oracle.com/assets/application-licensing-table-070571.pdf\n\nOracle Licensing in the Cloud https://www.oracle.com/assets/cloud-licensing-070579.pdf\n\nOracle Database Licensing Information:\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dblic/database-licensing-information-user-manual.pdf\n\nOracle Middleware Licensing Information: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24628_01/doc.121/e24474/toc.htm\n\nFAQs on Oracle database licensing\n\nWhat are some examples of Oracle database software?\n\nExamples of Oracle database software include Oracle Enterprise Edition, Oracle Database Standard Edition 2, Oracle Standard Edition, and Oracle Standard Edition One.\n\nWhat needs to be licensed?\n\nEvery server where the processor is installed or running needs to be licensed. This includes production, test, development, and, most likely, disaster recovery environments.\n\nHow does Oracle license work?\n\nOracle’s licensing model allows individuals or systems to use specific software without restrictions on frequency of usage.\n\nThis means that a single license can support multiple deployments of the same software across various servers. Once a license has been procured for an individual or processor, no further licenses are necessary.\n\nWhat is Oracle Processor Licensing?\n\nOracle Processor licensing is used when users cannot be counted or verified. This is often the case with web-based applications.\n\nThe number of licenses required is calculated by multiplying the number of cores by the core processor-licensing factors specified in the Oracle Processor Table.\n\nWhat is the Oracle database price?\n\nThe price for Oracle software is per processor. However, Oracle’s definition of “processor” may not be identical to that of your hardware vendor. Standard Edition and Standard Edition 2 are counted the same as sockets when Oracle software is licensed.\n\nHowever, multi-chip modules count each chip as one socket. You must use the right licensing formula for Enterprise edition products to determine the “processors” required.\n\nWhat is Named User Plus Licensing?\n\nUser Plus Licensing is a licensing model allowing the licensee to pay per user. A user can be defined as any end node that creates or receives data from an Oracle database.\n\nWhat are the minimums for Named User Plus licenses?\n\nThe Database edition determines the license user minimums. Enterprise Edition licenses require a minimum of 25 named users plus per processor licenses, or the number of users using the Oracle Database. Standard Edition 2 allows for a minimum of 10 users per server.\n\nWhich devices need to be licensed under Named User Plus Licensing?\n\nAll devices connected to the Oracle Database must be licensed if humans do not operate them.\n\nAll humans using human-operated devices, such as barcode scanners, must be licensed if they connect to the Oracle Database. Non-human and human-operated devices that relate to the Oracle Database must be licensed.\n\nHow can you understand who needs to be counted for Named User Plus licensing?\n\nTo understand who needs to be counted for Named User Plus licensing, consider the source of information and where the requests are coming from. Oracle NUP licensing may be a good choice in closed environments with few users, such as test and development.\n\nWhat are the benefits and cons of Named User Plus licensing?\n\nThe benefits of Named User Plus licensing include cost-effectiveness, negotiable licensing minimums, and easy upgrade to Oracle processor licensing. The cons need to keep track of users and compliance problems with multiplexing software.\n\nWhat are the licensing scenarios for Oracle Processor licensing?\n\nOracle Processor licensing is used in scenarios where the user population is not countable or very large, such as Oracle Databases for applications accessing the web.\n\nWhat are the benefits and cons of Oracle Processor licensing?\n\nThe benefits of Oracle Processor licensing include not having to count or keep control of users, having many different product versions to choose from, and having easy upgrades.\n\nThe cons include being unable to downgrade to a lesser product version and being the most expensive licensing choice in many situations.\n\nWhat are the licensing fundamentals for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition?\n\nLicensing fundamentals for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition include requiring the same license and quantities for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Options and licensing all Oracle Enterprise Products by counting cores.\n\nIf licensing with Oracle NUP, the user minimum is calculated as 25 users per Oracle processor, meaning even if you have five users, you still need 25 to cover the licensing minimums.\n\nWhat are Oracle Database Enterprise Edition options?\n\nOracle Database Enterprise Edition options are products that each contain multiple features and are available to license under Oracle Database Enterprise Edition only. There are 18 different Oracle Enterprise Edition options products, including Multitenant, RAC, Active Data Guard, Partitioning, Real Application Testing, Advanced Compression, Advanced Security, Label Security, Database Vault, OLAP, TimesTen Application, Database In-Memory, Diagnostic Pack, Tuning Pack, Database Lifecycle Management Pack, Data Masking and Subsetting Pack, and Cloud Management Pack for Oracle Database.\n\nWhat happens if you use or enable Oracle Enterprise Edition options on Standard Edition databases?\n\nIf you use or enable Oracle Enterprise Edition options on Standard Edition databases, Oracle will require you to license that database with Enterprise Edition.\n\nHow do you license Oracle Database Enterprise Edition options?\n\nTo license Oracle Database Enterprise Edition options, you must count the number of physical cores in the server and cluster. Then, multiply the physical processor cores with the Oracle license factor to obtain the “Oracle processor” requirements.\n\nThe same license and quantity metrics for the option license must match the database. Suppose you have 8 Enterprise Edition processors and are using partitioning in one of the databases running on that server. In that case, you need to license the entire server with a partitioning license, and vice versa if you have Named User Plus licensing.\n\nWhat are Oracle Enterprise License Agreements?\n\nOracle Enterprise License Agreements provide unlimited license grants for a specific set of products.\n\nThe ULA is a term-based agreement between 1 and 5 years. At the end of the term, you can renew or certify the ULA. The PULA is a perpetual version of the ULA that never expires. Another Oracle ELA is the pool of funds agreement.\n\nHow much does Oracle licensing cost?\n\nOracle Database Enterprise licensing is $47,500 per Oracle Processor license, and Oracle prices are publicly available.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that an Oracle processor does not equal an Intel or AMD processor.\n\nAn Oracle processor is calculated by licensing the number of physical cores a processor has and multiplying this with the Oracle licensing core factor table.\n\nHow can you calculate Oracle license costs for Enterprise Database Products?\n\nTo calculate Oracle license costs for Enterprise Database Products, multiply the physical cores by the Oracle licensing factor table. For example, if you have an Intel Xeon processor 9200 with 16 cores and one processor, and Oracle has defined Intel with an Oracle licensing factor of 0.5, you would need to license that server with eight processor licenses x $47,500 = $380,000.\n\nHow can you calculate Oracle license costs for Database Standard Edition 2?\n\nTo calculate Oracle license costs for Enterprise Database Products, multiply the physical cores by the Oracle licensing factor table.\n\nFor example, if you have an Intel Xeon processor 9200 with 16 cores and one processor, and Oracle has defined Intel with an Oracle licensing factor of 0.5, you would need to license that server with eight processor licenses x $47,500 = $380,000.\n\nHow many databases can I run on a server that is licensed 1 processor Standard Edition?\n\nYou can run as many as you want; licensing is based on the physical processor power, not the number of database instances.\n\nIf we want to upgrade from 10 to 19c, do we need to purchase a new license?\n\nNo, licensing is perpetual; it does not expire. However, you need to keep paying the annual support, which allows you to upgrade to later versions at no cost.\n\nIs Oracle licensing perpetual?\n\nYes, when you purchase an Oracle license, it is usually perpetual and never expires.\n\nThis means there are no additional licensing fees after the one-time license fee. Additionally, when you purchase a perpetual license, you also purchase one year of technical support, which is renewed annually.\n\nWhat is the list price for a term license?\n\nThe list price for a term license is based on a specific percentage of the perpetual license price, with one year at 20% of the list price.\n\nHow does BYOL work for Azure and AWS?\n\nBYOL for Azure and AWS is not very different from licensing software on-premise. The only difference is that Oracle has approved Azure and AWS hypervisors, and you can license per vCPU.\n\nWhat licensing models are offered by Oracle for Applications?\n\nThe Component Model is an a la carte pricing method for an individual product. Available metrics include user-based metrics such as Application User, Employee, and Subscriber and usage-based metrics such as Electronic Order Lines, Expense Reports, and $M Costs Of Goods Sold.\n\nIs Oracle database free?\n\nThe only free version of the Oracle database is the Oracle Database XE version; all other editions require a license purchase. Oracle 23c For Developers is also free.\n\nCan I transfer my Oracle license to another party?\n\nYes, but Oracle’s prior written approval is required. If your company is engaged in M&A – you should review your contracts.\n\nDo Oracle have different licensing policies?\n\nYes, at least five different Oracle database license policy documents address how to license Oracle in virtual environments, public clouds, disaster recovery, and more.\n\nDoes Oracle EBS come with an Oracle Database Included?\n\nYes, however, very few organizations, if any, can avoid triggering full use of the Oracle EBS database.\n\nHow is Oracle Big Data SQL Licensed?\n\nOracle Big Data SQL is not licensed per processor or named user plus but rather by the disk drive.\n\nWhat is Oracle SIG?\n\nOracle SIG is short for Oracle Software Investment Guide. It was an educational document that was published on Oracle.com.\n\nOracle 19c Licensing Changes:\n\nSupport for Pluggable Databases (PDBs) without Additional License: Oracle Database 19c now allows up to 3 PDBs per container database (CDB) without requiring an additional multitenant license. This change provided more flexibility in database management without extra licensing costs.\n\nNo Real Application Clusters (RAC) in SE2: A notable change in Oracle 19c is the removal of support for Real Application Clusters (RAC) in the Standard Edition 2 (SE2). This means that RAC, previously available in SE2, can no longer be used starting from Oracle 19c.\n\nLicensing Limitations for SE2: The SE2 version imposed limitations on the total number of CPU sockets and the maximum number of CPU threads per database instance. While SE allowed up to four sockets (and SE1 two sockets), SE2 limited the number of sockets to two and restricted CPU threads.\n\nOur Oracle License Compliance Service:\n\nExpert Oracle Licensing Support at Your Fingertips\n\nOur Oracle License Management Services, will help you with the following:\n\nFormer Oracle License Auditors: Benefit from the insights of experienced professionals.\n\nComprehensive Services:\n\nAccurate licensing reports.\n\nSpecialized advice on Oracle licensing topics.\n\nGlobal Reach, Remote Delivery: Serving over 200 clients in 41 countries, all services are delivered remotely.\n\nSchedule a Consultation: Discuss how we can support your organization with our tailored Oracle licensing solutions.\n\nContact us\n\nAuthor\n\nFredrik Filipsson brings two decades of Oracle license management experience, including a nine-year tenure at Oracle and 11 years in Oracle license consulting.
