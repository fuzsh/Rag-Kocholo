        "text": "Here’s a guide to what we mean by different terms that you might come across on Dealroom globally.\n\nEntities\n\nFunded company\n\nA company which has known backing from PEs, VCs, angels, grants, or is affiliated with an accelerator or university.\n\nStartup\n\n“A startup is a company designed to grow fast.” Paul Graham\n\nThe question of what a startup is, is a complex one. For a detailed approach, take a look at this article we wrote: What is a Startup?\n\nIn practical terms, at Dealroom, we qualify startups based on the following characteristics:\n\nRapidly scaling/scalable: as a result of #1, this means that the company can achieve high growth by leveraging its platform.\n\nFounded after 1990\n\nInnovative by design: the product and/or business model are innovative. In most cases, the company is tech-enabled: proprietary tech/software or business processes heavily enabled by tech.\n\nIn other words, a startup is a venture-backable company.\n\nScaleup\n\nA scaleup in its growing phase (growing revenue and over 51 employees)\n\nCorporate\n\nA company that has reached the mature stage of its life cycle, through its development, expansion, or acquisition of other companies.\n\nInvestor\n\nAn entity or individual investing capital in companies (including investment funds (angel funds, VC. PE), Family offices, CVC, Corporates, Angels).\n\nService Provider\n\nA company providing services to other companies on a project basis\n\nPeople\n\nInclude angel investors, founders, and users.\n\nUniversities\n\nEducational institutions.\n\nGovernments and Non-Profits\n\nGovernment agencies and non-profit organisations.\n\nNew Funds\n\nAccording to Investopedia: “An investment fund is a supply of capital belonging to numerous investors used to collectively purchase securities while each investor retains ownership and control of his own shares”.\n\nAt Dealroom, we keep track of some of the different types of funds: venture capital, private equity, growth equity, life sciences, renewables, and corporate. An illustrative example is the following:\n\nName\n\nFund Type\n\nAmount\n\nDate\n\nDawn IV\n\nVenture Capital\n\n€400M\n\nSep 2020\n\nClient Focus\n\nB2B (Business)\n\nCompanies whose customers are mainly or only other businesses\n\nB2C (Consumer)\n\nCompanies whose customers are mainly or only individual consumers\n\nBusiness Model\n\neCommerce & Marketplace\n\nA place connecting a buyer(s) and seller(s) where goods or services are bought, sold or exchanged\n\nManufacturing\n\nThe making of goods by hand or by machine that upon completion the business sells to a customer\n\nSaaS\n\nSoftware-as-a-Service, a method of software delivery and licensing in which software is accessed online via a subscription, rather than bought and installed on individual computers\n\nIncome Stream\n\nAdvertising\n\nMonetary income that individuals and businesses earn from displaying paid advertisements on their websites, social media channels, or other platforms surrounding their internet-based content\n\nCommission\n\nRefers to fees earned in making a sale or closing a deal\n\nSubscription\n\nA periodic (monthly, quarterly or yearly) fee paid by the customer to access a service or product.\n\nWebsites with a pricing page are usually subscription-based.\n\nEx: SaaS businesses, membership fee.\n\nInvestor types\n\nAccelerators\n\nFixed-term, cohort-based programs that include seed investment, connections, sales, mentorship, educational components, and culminate in a public pitch event or demo day to accelerate growth.\n\nExample: Y Combinator\n\nAngels\n\nIndividuals who provide capital for a business start-up.\n\nExample: Marc Benioff\n\nCorporates\n\nLarge companies investing in startups, sometimes via a Corporate Venture Fund (CVC).\n\nExample: Amazon.com\n\nVenture capital (VC)\n\nThese are investment funds that manage the money of investors who seek private equity stakes in startups and small- to medium-sized enterprises with strong growth potential.\n\nExample: LocalGlobe\n\nPrivate equity\n\nPrivate equity funds more closely resemble venture capital firms in that they invest directly in companies, primarily by purchasing private companies, although they sometimes seek to acquire a controlling interest in publicly traded companies through stock purchases.\n\nExample: KKR\n\nFamily office\n\nThey are private wealth management advisory firms that serve ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) investors.\n\nExample: Talis Capital\n\nGovernment and non-profit\n\nExample: European Investment Bank\n\nAdvisor\n\nIt refers to investment banks and financial advisory firms that invest into startups.\n\nInvestment rounds types\n\nFor €1-4M deals, when the round happened 0-2 years after the company’s foundation\n\nSERIES A\n\nFor €4-15M deals\n\nSERIES B\n\nFor €15-40M deals\n\nSERIES C\n\nFor €40-100M deals\n\nMegarounds\n\nFor €100-250M deals\n\nMegaround+\n\nFor €250M+ deals\n\nIndustries and sub-industries\n\nEnergy\n\nStartups working towards transitioning to sustainable energy, making our energy consumption greener and more efficient, and solutions for recycling and handling waste.\n\nFrom energy-efficient buildings to AI-powered smart meters to enterprise-grade solutions for solar and wind power, renewable energies and storage are a few examples.\n\nFashion\n\nTechnology that enables a fashion experience when you wear it or interact with it\n\nFintech\n\nFintech is the intersection between finance and technology. The following categorization is constantly evolving to keep up with the sector evolution. ABN AMRO Ventures, our main partner for Fintech and a leading Fintech CVC also contributed to this taxonomy. This taxonomy is also reflected on the fintech platform.\n\nThe fintech industry in Dealroom is broken down into the 8 sub-industries below:\n\nSub-industry Description Example Payments Startups developing solutions to improve the way financial transactions are settled, and how money is transferred between two parties. Klarna, Transferwise, Checkout Banking Startups developing solutions, and/or digitising the activities, services and products of traditional banks.

Eg: accounting software, billing software. Taxfix, Spendesk, Linxo RegTech Solutions to comply with regulatory requirements in financial services, from customer identification (KYC), anti-money laundering, fraud detection and compliance & reporting. Fourthline, Complyadvantage, Cappitech\n\nFood\n\nFoodTech is an ecosystem made of all the agrifood entrepreneurs and startups (from production to distribution) innovating on the products, distribution, marketing or business model.\n\nGaming\n\nStartups involved in the development, marketing, and monetisation of games (video games, online games, board games…)\n\nHealth\n\nHealth Tech, or digital health, uses technology (databases, applications, mobiles, wearables) to improve the delivery, payment, and/or consumption of care, with the ability to increase the development and commercialisation of medicinal products\n\nTransportation\n\nStartups developing solutions, software, tools and machines used to solve problems or improve conditions with respect to the movement of people and goods\n\nSub-industry Description Mobility Startups developing transportation solutions getting people from point A to point B. This includes ride hailing, ride sharing, public transport and micromobility.\n\nExample: Uber, Via, BlaBlaCar, Mobike\n\nSearch, Buy & Rent Marketplaces and other solutions to enable and facilitate new and used vehicle purchasing, vehicle rental and leasing, as well financing.\n\nExample: Auto1Group, Cinch, Openlending, Drivy\n\nMaintenance Solutions to improve maintenance and aftermarket for vehicles including platforms to connect users to networks of repair dealers, claim estimation for insurance, B2B solutions and marketplaces for parts.\n\nExample: Fixico, Snapsheet, CassTime, Carzone\n\nNavigation & Mapping Startups developing solutions to track vehicles, provide navigation and mapping.

Insurance as an industry touches many other sectors mobility and real estate (car and home insurance), health (health insurance) etc, for a basic overview see Insurance ecosystems. This does not mean that every startup in telemedicine which works with an insurance company or a generic enterprise software solution used also by insurers are considered insurtech. Insurtech need to have a predominant part of their business strictly related to insurance, also just offering insurance as part of a marketplace does not make them insurtechs.\n\nA good example is the distinction between Alan and players such as Kry. Both offer telemedicine services, but Alan does that coming from health insurance and adds those services as add ons and expansion of their offer, while Kry is a telemedicine provider which partners with insurers. Alan is, therefore, an insurtech and tagged under insurance in fintech, while Kry is not. For startups related to insurance but that are not insurtech there is a tag “Insurtech related”, this is only indicative and used mainly to highlight startups that have already disclosed partnerships with the insurance/insurtech industry.\n\nThe insurance value chain is complex and the industry has its own jargon. The basic insurance value chain is shown in the image below.\n\nReinsurers, like SwissRe, have the role of transferring risk from the insurers, they are basically the insurers of the insurers. Insurers are the ones who carry the risk and are therefore referred also as carriers.\n\nInsurtech division by value chain:\n\nThe main processes involved in insurance are reinsurance, product & pricing, underwriting, distribution & brokerage, claim management.\n\nReinsurance: these startups focus on optimizing reinsurance processes or acting as a bridge between reinsurers and insurers/insurtechs. For instance, acting as risk transfer marketplaces. Examples: Nayms, RYSKEX.\n\nFor an overview of startups working on product & pricing, underwriting and claim management visit this landscape. These startups offer SaaS to insurance companies to improve these key processes.\n\nInsurtech product and price: these startups help insurance companies optimize the definition of their products and their pricing, often enhancing the role of actuaries in the insurance industry. Examples: Akur8, Quantemplate.\n\nInsurtech underwriting: underwriting is the process in which the insurance companies evaluates the risk profiles of the customer and decide if to establish a contract with him and which is the level of risk of the client. The process is highly data-driven and requires also to detect potential frauds. Examples: Concirrus, Cytora.\n\nInsurtech claim: the claim is a process that goes from the notification of a loss from the client to the analysis of its validity and entity of the damage and its internal workflow processing. Startups in this field offer either workflow management solutions for the claims handling or solutions based on IoT, computer vision, satellite imagery etc to assess the claim remotely and automatically. Example: Omni:us, Tractable.\n\nInsurtech distribution and brokerage: startups with this tag offer either solutions to improve the distribution process to insurers, or act as marketplaces, comparator websites and brokers selling policies themselves. Example: Xempus, Gocompare, Clark\n\nA very important trend in distribution is Embedded insurance, more in this landscape.\n\nMGA: Managing General Agent or Managing General Underwriter (MGA/MGU) are startups that do not have an insurance carrier license, so are not insurers, but establish partnerships with insurers/insurtechs who are licensed and give them the permission to carry the risk. So MGAs act in front of the customer as full insurers while not being it. Example: Bought by Many, Luko, Inshur.\n\nThis is a rather difficult distinction to make, also startups often transition from being just distributors to acting as MGAs and then as full insurers as discussed in the upcoming insurtech report. This landscape elaborates this transition more in-depth.\n\nChallenger insurance: challenger insurance refers to the insurtech startups which have a license and are so independent to create products and underwrite risk for clients. Example: Lemonade, Alan, Root insurance.\n\nFull stack insurance: refers to insurtech who as the challengers have a license and cover the whole value chain but do not sell directly to customers or businesses but provide insurance as a service (IaaS) and white-label solutions to other players which then offer the insurance service. Example: Element Insurance, Qover.\n\nInsurtech division by sector:\n\nInsurance is primarily divided into two branches: Life and Health (L&H) and Product and Casualty (P&C).\n\nL&H insurance (LandH insurance) is composed of Health and Life and Annuity (L&A).\n\nHealth insurance: insurance segment which covers medical expenses and increasingly includes additional services such as digital platforms (telemedicine and other services) and digital health engaging and rewarding for a healthy lifestyle. Example: Alan, Dacadoo, YAS.life\n\nLife insurance: insurance segment which provides a financial payout in case of death, or critical illness in some cases, to allow beloved to sustain living expenses in case of tragedies. Sometimes mixed with pension insurance and savings products. Example: Bestow, Xempus, DeadHappy\n\nPension insurance: insurance segment which provides savings products with a certain guaranteed return. Example: Vantik, Brand New Day\n\nMore about life and pension insurance in this landscape.\n\nP&C insurance (PandC insurance) covers losses in the form of damages to assets. It is composed of several segments usually divided into Commercial lines (B2B) such as: general commercial insurance (liability etc), cyber insurance, property insurance and Personal Lines (B2C) such as car insurance, house insurance, pet insurance, product insurance.\n\nHouse and property insurance: insurance segment which covers damages to properties such as private houses and commercial buildings, including solutions for underwriting and claims management such as mobile, drone or satellite image capture and analytics. It includes also insurance of objects inside the house, rental insurance and title insurance. A more granular subdivision can be found in this landscape. Example: Luko, Urban Jungle, Hippo insurance, Hover, Cape analytics\n\nClimate risk: indicates insurance services related to weather and climate events such as wildfires, floods, hurricanes, often referred to as Catastrophe insurance. It includes also farming insurance which can be filtered with the food industry. Example: Floodflash, Wetterheld, Pula advisor, Understory\n\nParametric insurance: refers to insurance products where the premium and payout is automatically calculated based on index parameters, when the parameters reach a certain level (such as water depth or wind speed) it triggers the payments. The claim process is therefore automatic and transparent. It has been mostly been applied to the Catastrophe industry, but other applications include cyber&business continuity, cargo transport etc. More in this landscape. Example: Floodflash, Exante, Parsyl, Previsico\n\nCar insurance: insurance segments for car vehicles, includes also telematics solutions for insurance\n\nExample: Prima.it, Snapsheet, Concirrus, Marshmallow, By miles, Root insurance,\n\nVehicle insurance: adjacent sectors to car insurance such as Ridesharing and food delivery (Example: Zego), truck insurance (Example: HVDI), bike insurance (Example: Laka), drone insurance (Example: flock)\n\nProduct insurance: insurance segments covering product warranties, strongly related to e-commerce and retail. Example: Simplesurance, Extend\n\nCyber insurance: insurance that covers damages from cyber attacks, mostly for businesses. It sees many cybersecurity specialists establishing partnerships with insurtech/insurers. Example: Coalition, Kovrr, Cybersmart. It includes also solutions for crypto assets and other digital assets. Example: Nayms, Coincover.\n\nCommercial insurance: includes insurance covers such as General Liability, Workers’ Compensation, Professional Liability, Commercial Auto, Tools & Equipment for businesses (especially SMEs, freelancers, contractors, entrepreneurs). Example: Next insurance, Pie Insurance, InsureQ, Tapoly\n\nTravel insurance: it is composed of either products more related to P&C lines such as flight delay and luggage damages/loss and related to L&H such as medical coverage during travel abroad. Example: Battleface, Koala insurance\n\nPet insurance: insurance products for pet ownership, can include veterinarian and health coverage as well as liability insurance. Example: BoughtbyMany, Pawlicy Advisor\n\nReal Estate\n\nReal Estate tech or PropTech (property technology) is the use of information technology to help individuals and companies research, buy, sell and manage real estate.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing technology (also known as MarTech) describes any number of systems and tools that help marketers better engage with potential and existing customers.\n\nMedia\n\nMedia technology is any hardware, software, or tool that is used to compose, create, produce, deliver and manage media including audio, video, images, information, interactive media, video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality environments.\n\nOther Industries\n\nJobs Recruitment\n\nStartups developing solutions, services & software designed to improve the recruitment process within a business or for individuals seeking a job.\n\nHome Living\n\nStartups developing products and services improving the comfort of homes.

So far we have manually classified over +14,000 startups using this framework.\n\nHow do you label impact startups?\n\nWe employed a set of keywords to filter dealroom’s startups for affinity with the SDGs[2]. Then, we reviewed startups’ public disclosed information, such as business model, mission statement, and case studies to assess their SDGs focus.\n\nIs climate tech part of your taxonomy?\n\nWe share PwC’s definition of climate tech as “a broad set of sectors which tackle the challenge of decarbonizing the global economy”[3]. As a result, climate tech companies can be found using the “climate tech” tag, for example, check this query.\n\nIn dealroom, companies tackling any of the following SDGs: clean water and sanitation (#6), affordable and clean energy (#7), responsible consumption and production (#12), climate action (#13) life below water (#14), life on land (#15) would also qualify as a “climate tech” startup. As a result, the ” climate tech” tag is attributed automatically to those companies.\n\nHow do you tackle greenwashing?\n\nWe are aware of the constraints of the above-mentioned approach. In fact, there are clear limitations on the quantity and quality of publicly available information of often small and private companies. Therefore, this impact categorization is an ongoing process and a company’s taxonomy might be subject to change.\n\nWhat do Core and Side mean?\n\nAdditionally, we differentiate between impact startups that have impact at the ‘core’ of their business model and the ones that have it as a ‘side’ or peripheral focus[4]. The aim of this distinction is to make it easier for the user to identify and distinguish between companies that are purely mission-driven e.g. The Ocean Cleanup and others, like Tier Mobility, that creates positive externalities in an indirect way. Core-focused companies are not necessarily creating more impact compared to side-focus companies. This would depend on a variety of factors, such as their market sizes and reach.\n\nCan a company tackle multiple SDGs at the same time?\n\nYes, a company can address more than one SDG at the same time e.g. Affordable and Clean Energy (#7) and Industry, Innovation and infrastructure (#9).\n\nIs impact the same as tech for good, social impact and purpose-driven tech?\n\nPurpose-driven startups, responsible tech, social impact, tech for good are other terms[5] that are also used to describe the space where a company is aiming to create a positive impact beyond just financial returns.\n\nWhat about Environmental Social Governance (ESG) criteria?\n\nEnvironmental Social Governance (ESG) criteria are a set of non-financial standards used to evaluate companies according to metrics like CO2 emissions, employee relations, and conflicts of interest.[6] Impact startups go a step further compared to ESG companies, not only they do not operate in industries like tobacco, weapons but they try to create a positive impact on the planet and its people.\n\nWhat is an Impact VC?\n\nHere, Impact VCs have been selected through a mix of criteria that include: the self-reported mission statement of the investor; an investor having a dedicated fund for impact or diversity; the investor having a specific focus on underrepresented founders. However, as impact investments now make up a significant proportion of all investments, the line between impact and non-impact VCs is blurring. Impact VCs now frequently co-invest with established VC funds, making more capital and expertise available to impact startups than ever before.\n\n[1] https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\n\n[2] All the keywords are listed in the appendix.\n\n[3] See p6, https://pwc.to/3kjlb07\n\n[4] A similar approach was employed in the 2019 State of European Tech\n\n[5] For example, see https://www.slush.org/entrepreneurship-redefined/purpose-driven-change/\n\n[6] For a more comprehensive overview see: https://www.investopedia.com/financial-advisor/esg-sri-impact-investing-explaining-difference-clients/\n\nFilters by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)\n\nNo Poverty #1\n\nDescription: End poverty in all its forms everywhere\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Extreme poverty, unbanked, disaster prevention, microlending\n\nZero Hunger #2\n\nDescription: End hunger, achieve food security, and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Food security, vertical farming, poor nutrition, permaculture\n\nGood Health and Well-being #3\n\nDescription: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Prenatal care, road safety, telemedicine, contraception, antimicrobial resistance, elderly care\n\nQuality Education #4\n\nDescription: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Universal primary education, equal education\n\nGender Equality #5\n\nDescription: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: AI measuring bias, reproductive rights, female health, non-binary\n\nClean Water and Sanitation #6\n\nDescription: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Safe water, wastewater treatment, water-saving, desalination\n\nAffordable and Clean Energy #7\n\nDescription: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Solar energy, wind energy, tidal power, hydrogen, off-grid\n\nDecent work and economic growth #8\n\nDescription: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Gender pay gap, equal pay, inclusive employment, fair trade\n\nIndustry, Innovation and infrastructure #9\n\nDescription: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Sustainable industrialization, universal access to technology, inclusive industrialization\n\nReduced inequalities #10\n\nDescription: Reduce inequality within and among countries\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Safe migration, refugees integration, racial discrimination\n\nSustainable Cities and communities #11\n\nDescription: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Air quality measurement, urban waste reduction, affordable housing\n\nResponsible consumption and Production #12\n\nDescription: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Food waste, sustainable fashion, circular, sustainable materials\n\nClimate Action #13\n\nDescription: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Carbon capture, carbon offset, climate tech, alternative protein\n\nLife below Water #14\n\nDescription: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Marine conservation, seafood substitutes, overfishing, plastic pollution\n\nLife on Land #15\n\nDescription: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Forestry, biodiversity, wildfires\n\nPeace, justice and strong institutions #16\n\nDescription: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: Govtech, digital democracy, corruption prevention\n\nPartnerships #17\n\nDescription: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSelected dealroom’s keywords: SDG partnership, impact partnership\n\nAdditional terminology\n\nUnicorn\n\nCompanies founded since 1990 that reached USD $1 billion valuation.

In fact, the ‘last funding year minimum’ filter is also applied on top of the valuation range. They also exclude acquired and public owned companies.\n\nZebra\n\n“These are companies that, instead of seeking to blitz-scale their way to market dominance, fuelled by multiple venture capital fundraising rounds, prioritise profitability. Zebras also tend to be focused on equitable ownership and building sustainable businesses, and they seek to create a positive social impact, for example by providing solutions for underserved markets or prioritising employee happiness” (Source).\n\nFounder ranking\n\nWe have created an algorithm to determine the propensity for success of startup and scaleup founders. You can apply these filters in the Advanced filters section of the Startups & scaleups tab or the New startups tab.\n\nExceptional founders and Strong founders have a proven track record for success – they may have founded another successful startup, held a high position and/or have a strong educational background.\n\nPromising founders often have a strong educational background as well as work experience at a notable company.\n\nFunding rounds\n\nExcludes Grant rounds and rounds for companies with an “outside tech” model\n\nExit\n\nAn exit occurs when an investor decides to liquidate their stake in a company. In Dealroom, Exits are a subset of all transactions, grouped in a specific Exits tab. Buyouts, M&A, secondary rounds, and IPOs are treated as exits.\n\nEcosystem value\n\nSum of the valuations of all startups in the ecosystem. Using estimated valuations based on most recent VC rounds, public markets and publically disclosed valuations.\n\nSnowball effect/ Startup Mafia/ Founder Factories"
