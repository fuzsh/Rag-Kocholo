        "text": "What is real-time analytics?\n\nGartner says \"Real-time analytics is the discipline that applies logic and mathematics to data to provide insights for making better decisions quickly. For some use cases, real time simply means the analytics is completed within a few seconds or minutes after the arrival of new data.\"\n\nReal time analytics refers to the process of preparing and measuring data as soon as it enters into the system. In other words, capture live streams of data, process them very quickly, and extract insights or perform operations on the data in real time, which allows businesses to react without delay. They can seize opportunities or prevent problems before they happen. Real-time processing requires a continual input of data, constant processing and steady output of data.\n\nReal-time analytics can be classified into following types:\n\nStreaming Analytics: process the event data on a continuous basis and stream the process result to downstream applications or users in real-time. Example: Online sales trends of specific products for eCommerce company, Forex, stock/share real-time price movements of Bank or investment company, event tracking etc.\n\nOn-demand Analytics: Process the event data in real-time and store processed data in a data store or in an application. Users or applications consume processed data on needy a basis from high performing analytical data store. Example: Total web page error messages in last 1 hour, web page visits Vs sale conversation rates since sale launch, Total subscription of an IPO for last 5 hours.\n\nEvent Tracking in Real-time Data Analytics\n\nThe Event Streaming Data Architecture\n\nThe data architecture of event streaming comprises 3 fundamental components\n\nMessage Broker: It collects streaming data from so-called producers. Producers can track any event ranging from metrics, clickstreams, searches and etc. All these actions are then stored into the atomic building blocks of the Apache Kafka architecture, namely topics and partitions. One of the key strength of Kafka is its ability to parallelize partitions in order to increase the overall throughput. The information is then made available to consumers which will be using this output in different ways.\n\n*Note: Kafka has been considered as message broker in the following architecture as it is one of the most popular message brokers, and others are Amazon Kenisis, Google Could Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ etc.\n\nETL Process: The raw data is then transformed and cleaned so that it can be then used by SQL-based systems in order to be analyzed later on.\n\nData Storage & Analysis: After the data is prepared by our data stream processors we have to store it analyze it in order to provide valuable insights.\n\nEvent Tracking Use Case for retail eCommerce\n\nIts been year+ into COVID-19 and it is not ending soon, consumer shopping online has increased significantly across many categories. Consumer intent to shop online continues to increase, especially in essentials and home-entertainment categories.
