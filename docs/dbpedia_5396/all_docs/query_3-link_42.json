        "text": "I have an idea to help the wine industry. It's very simple: $25 Wine Day.\n\nThe idea is exactly as it sounds. On one day a year, on the 25th of some month other than December, any retail store that wants to participate can put a wine on sale for $25. Wineries should participate too. Next March 25: $25 Wine Day is here at last!\n\nRelated stories: US Alcohol Industry's Worst Year Since 1991 Wine's Decline Mirrors Political Change Champagne Prepares for a Sobering Vintage\n\nHere's how I came to this idea. People like sale days: Black Friday has spawned Cyber Monday. Amazon Prime Day gets free publicity in newspapers and TV stations. Why not have a Wine Day? But just doing a sale isn't enough.\n\nThe website Wine Berserkers has an annual Berserker Day in which wineries go to the site and offer sales. I have considered writing an article about it several times. The problem is in the execution. The deals offered are almost all winery-friendly, not consumer-friendly. They tend to be from some winery I've never heard of: \"We'll sell you our gold-medal-winning Cabernet Franc, normally, $65, for $55.\"\n\nWhoop-de-doo. That's not how most people buy wine: most people have a price range and look for the most interesting wines within it.\n\nBerserker Day also shows that most wineries grossly overestimate the market value of their unsold inventory. Your unsold $65 wine doesn't become a deal at $55.\n\nMost shoppers are price-conscious. They don't care what your suggested retail price was. They want to spend $25. It's the one sweet spot for wine sales that is high volume and hasn't plummeted over the last few years.\n\nThis is how the world's biggest retail wine stores work, from state-run stores in Scandinavia to supermarkets in the UK to the biggest US retail chains. They commission wines from certain regions to meet certain price points. They're looking for a Chianti Classico they can retail at $20, a South African Chardonnay they can retail at $15, etc. Why do they do this?\n\nBecause they specialize in selling wine. They know what consumers want, and what consumers are willing to pay for it.\n\nThe whole industry should take a lesson from these wine-sales specialists, and $25 Wine Day is the way to do it. The industry is flooded with inventory and needs to not only sell more wine, but get people more excited about buying wine.\n\nSo instead of demanding that consumers overpay to meet your production costs, why not give consumers what they have told us over and over that they want? They want a $25 wine that tastes good. Wineries can do that!\n\nAn obvious issue with this idea is that there's no way to standardize the offer. Some wineries might put their $60 single-vineyard Pinot on sale; others will try to sell five-year-old rosé. It's the same with Berserker Day: there will be a few really good offers and some not so good. But unlike Berserker Day, nobody will spend more than $25 on a wine they don't end up liking. Most consumers have shown they are willing to risk that much.\n\nBeer is better\n\nOther intoxicants have a day. Craft beer in California has the day Pliny the Younger is released by Russian River Brewing Company. Beer lovers take the day off work and queue up outside bars that advertise ahead of time they will have a barrel of it. People drink a mug of Pliny whenever they reach the front of the queue: morning, afternoon, whenever. Wineries hold release parties in California all the time, but even the biggest wineries don't approach the Pliny level of enthusiasm.\n\nAlso in California, April 20 has become so synonymous with cannabis that San Francisco was unable to cancel 4/20 day in Golden Gate Park. This celebration evolved completely organically, starting with teens who used the time they like to get high after school, 4:20, as a synonym for weed. Now it's a national weed holiday everywhere that cannabis is legal.\n\nIn comparison, wine is saddled with a calendar of bogus PR-agency-created days that nobody observes: Furmint Day, or Moscato Day. Consumers see right through those.\n\nWine columnists Dorothy Gaiter and John Brecher created Open That Bottle Night in 1999 when they worked at the Wall Street Journal. The idea is still brilliant: that all of us, enophiles and people who rarely drink wine, have a special bottle that we have been saving for an occasion that might never arise (ask me about the Champagne I still have in my fridge for a Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl victory).\n\nI love Open That Bottle Night, but it leans older for an obvious reason: you can't have a bottle you have held onto for 20 years if you're 29 years old. It also is about drinking a wine you already have rather than going out to buy wine. We need a day when young people say: \"We gotta stop at the store and pick up some wine – today!\"\n\nThe one special wine day we have is December 31, when people who never usually buy sparkling wine go out to stores to find one. Truckloads of bubbles are moved to prepare for December 31; before the Prosecco boom, December 31 kept a lot of sparkling producers alive. Now let's see if we can do something for still wines.\n\nNapa Valley Vintners are pushing a new initiative called Come Over October, encouraging people who haven't had visitors since the pandemic to invite friends over to share a bottle of wine. It's good as far as it goes, but it also leans older, and moreover (sorry NVV), these days a house party doesn't mean a reason to drink wine. Younger apartment dwellers are more likely to celebrate Come Over October with a six-pack of canned cocktails.\n\nI'm a wine journalist, not a publicist. I don't know how to get the ball rolling on $25 Wine Day. Suggesting it is where I jump off. Please, somebody smarter and better-positioned than me, find a way to get this train rolling.\n\nI've got $25. What's the best bottle in your store that I can have for that?"
