        "text": "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) M7i-flex and M7i instances are next-generation general purpose instances powered by custom 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code named Sapphire Rapids) and feature a 4:1 ratio of memory to vCPU. EC2 instances powered by these custom processors, available only on AWS, offer the best performance among comparable Intel processors in the cloud – up to 15% better performance than Intel processors utilized by other cloud providers.\n\nM7i-flex instances provide the easiest way for you to get price performance benefits for a majority of general-purpose workloads. They deliver up to 19% better price performance compared to M6i instances. M7i-flex instances offer the most common sizes, from large to 8xlarge, with up to 32 vCPUs, 128 GiB memory, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources. M7i-flex instances are designed to seamlessly run the most common general-purpose workloads, including web and application servers, virtual desktops, batch processing, microservices, databases, and enterprise applications.\n\nM7i instances offer price performance benefits for workloads that need larger instance sizes (up to 192 vCPUs and 768 GiB memory) or continuous high CPU usage. M7i instances are ideal for workloads including large application servers and databases, gaming servers, CPU-based machine learning (ML), and video streaming. M7i instances deliver up to 15% better price performance compared to M6i instances.\n\nMany customers do not fully utilize all the compute resources of an EC2 instance. Those customers are therefore paying for performance that they don’t need. Amazon EC2 M7i-flex instances offer the easiest way to achieve improved price performance for a majority of general purpose workloads. Amazon EC2 Flex instances efficiently use compute resources with the ability to scale up to full compute performance a majority of the time. Flex instances are purpose-built to optimize cost and performance."
