        "text": "Year-End Review:\n\nSISONKE Universal Boost COVID T-Cell vaccine trial initiates Phase 3 enrollment in South Africa in previously vaccinated participants\n\nIncreased GMP manufacturing capacity for RNA, DNA, Subunit Proteins, and Adjuvants vaccine platforms in U.S., South Africa, and Botswana\n\nNon-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) planned data cutoff in January 2022 with median follow-up exceeding 24-months for carcinoma in situ (CIS) cohort; Biologics License Application (BLA) filing planned for Q1, 2022\n\nThirteen (13) Phase 2 / 3 clinical trials in progress for the treatment of multiple tumor types, COVID, and HIV\n\nSeminal immunotherapy patents issued with terms extended to 2038\n\nCULVER CITY, Calif., December 20, 2021- ImmunityBio, Inc. (NASDAQ: IBRX), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, has successfully raised an aggregate $470 million of equity and debt financing in 2021, with $300 million in new debt financing from NantCapital, LLC. With this new financing from ImmunityBio’s founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, on December 17, 2021, the company is now well positioned to pursue its late-stage clinical portfolio, expand large-scale GMP manufacturing capacity, and advance recruitment of a commercial organization in the urology market.\n\n“In just a short nine months since the formation of ImmunityBio following the merger with NantKwest in March 2021, the progress made in advancing the late-stage clinical platforms in cancer and infectious diseases has been quite remarkable,” said Soon-Shiong. “In less than one year, the company has accomplished several important milestones: advanced our Universal Boost COVID T-Cell Vaccine to Phase 3; acquired, developed, and scaled multiple vaccine platforms including DNA to RNA to Subunit proteins; expanded our GMP manufacturing capacity across NK cells, fusion proteins, and RNA vaccines; advanced clinical trial enrollment across pancreatic, breast, and bladder cancers; was selected by the NCI and national cooperative groups for a large Lung-MAP trial; advanced our HIV clinical program globally; and received issuance of seminal cancer vaccine and bladder cancer patents with terms up to 2038.”\n\n“With $470 million of financing achieved since the merger, we now have the resources to rapidly advance our late-stage pipeline, build upon our 400,000 sq. feet of GMP biologic, vaccine, and NK manufacturing facilities for 2022 and expand our commercial operations in anticipation of our bladder cancer BLA filing in Q1, 2022,” continued Soon-Shiong. “I am proud of the tireless efforts of management and of the entire organization who dedicated their efforts to accomplish these ambitious milestones and I am pleased to support the recently completed financing round.”\n\nImmunityBio now has 21 active clinical trials, 13 of which are in Phase II or III development. In addition, the company has held discussions with the FDA to file a biologics license application (BLA) for Anktiva™ (to be branded VesAnktiva™ for intravesical administration) plus BCG for BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer carcinoma in situ (CIS) with a planned data cutoff date of January 2022, under discussions with the FDA. By that date, the median follow-up of patients with high risk CIS BCG responsive disease will exceed 24 months.\n\nImmunityBio and its scientists published over twenty scientific papers on its immunotherapy portfolio in 2021 and the company has over 750 granted patents for its immunotherapy technologies, including the Nant Cancer Vaccine.\n\n“During the year, management and the clinical, regulatory, scientific, and manufacturing teams made tremendous progress across the board at ImmunityBio. We are advancing our clinical development at an increasing rate with the goal of positioning ourselves to apply for regulatory approval in 2022,” said Richard Adcock, President and CEO of ImmunityBio. “With the $300 million financing from NantCapital combined with the equity raised over the last nine months, we have made the decision to pause the At-the-Market offering and we are well positioned to further accelerate development of our oncology and COVID-19 trials— with the goal of bringing these promising technologies to more people in need globally.”\n\nClinical Year-End Review of Strategic Milestones:\n\n1. BCG-Unresponsive Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer CIS (QUILT 3.032)\n\nThe company reported that the primary end points were met for both CIS and Papillary BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in October 2021 with a complete remission rate of 72% and a 12-month disease-free rate of 57%, respectively.\n\nAt the end of November 2021, the company provided briefing books and updates to the FDA with November cutoff data showing a 72% complete response rate in the CIS cohort and a median duration of complete response of 24 months. Of note, in those patients who responded to the investigational therapeutic, the probability of avoiding both progression of bladder cancer and cystectomy for over 24 months exceeded 90 percent. The data to the FDA included findings that the combination of Anktiva and BCG had a high safety profile with zero percent treatment-related serious adverse events, zero percent immune related adverse events, and 100 percent bladder cancer-specific overall survival at 24 months. The company plans on a data cutoff in January 2022, which would provide a median follow up in this CIS cohort in excess of 24 months, and anticipates a BLA filing with this final analysis in Q1, 2022.\n\nThe papillary cohort continues to accrue and updates will be provided as part of an oral presentation at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2022.\n\nSeminal patents covering intravesical administration of BCG and Anktiva were issued (US 11,173,191 B2 and US 9,925,247 B2) providing term coverage until 2035.\n\n5. COVID Program to Overcome Spike Variants and Induce T Cell Immunity\n\nSince the inception of the pandemic, ImmunityBio and its scientists have hypothesized that antibody-based vaccines alone are insufficient to prevent transmission and will not overcome viral evolution, resulting in loss of efficacy of antibody-based vaccines with the inevitable development of variants. The company from the onset believed strongly that an immune response generating a combination of antibodies, T cells, and memory B cells is critical to prevent infection, reduce viral load, prevent transmission, provide durable protection and overcome this pandemic.\n\nIn order to reduce viral load, T cells are necessary to kill virally infected cells in the nasal and lung passages and thereby prevent transmission even from highly transmissible variants. The non-human primate COVID virus challenge study performed by ImmunityBio in September 2020, supported by BARDA confirmed that ImmunityBio’s second-generation hAd5 S+N vaccine accomplished the goal of reducing viral load following a COVID virus challenge, to non-detectable levels. The study was published on September 2021 in Frontiers in Immunology entitled, “Dual-Antigen COVID-19 Vaccine Subcutaneous Prime Delivery with Oral Boosts Protects NHP Against SARS-CoV-2 Challenge”, showing the presence of memory B cells and a rapid antibody response post-challenge with killing of infected cells resulting in no detectable COVID viruses in the nasal and lung passages.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, the ImmunityBio program was designed to pursue this strategy of driving T cell and antibody protection, and to develop a second-generation vaccine with broad depth of antigenic coverage. Furthermore, the company pursued a strategy to develop a vaccine that could be manufactured at scale, at low cost, overcome cold-chain distribution issues and provide long-lasting durable protection for the global population. The programs, initiated as early as March 2020, are described below and the initial findings have shown that hAd5 S+N vaccination as a single prime alone induces a 10-fold increase in mean T cell responses in Phase 1 participants and are sustained against spike variants.\n\nSince initiating the initial homologous prime boost trial in October 2020 in the United States, it has become apparent that a “mix-and-match” strategy could provide maximal immune protection. The company has followed this path and the homologous and heterologous portfolio of vaccine platforms are at various stages of clinical development.\n\nAbout ImmunityBio\n\nImmunityBio is a leading late-clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing next-generation therapies that drive immunogenic mechanisms for defeating cancers and infectious diseases. The company’s immunotherapy platform activates both the innate (natural killer cell and macrophage) and adaptive (T cell) immune systems to create long-term “immunological memory.”\n\nImmunityBio’s clinical pipeline consists of 21 clinical trials—13 of which are in Phase II or III development—across 12 indications in solid and liquid cancers (including bladder, pancreatic, and lung cancers) and infectious diseases (including SARS-CoV-2 and HIV). Currently 17 first-in-human immunotherapy agents are in clinical testing and, to date, over 1,800 patients have been studied with our antibody cytokine fusion proteins, albumin chemo immunomodulators, Adeno and yeast vaccines and our off-the-shelf natural killer cell products. Anktiva™ (ImmunityBio’s lead cytokine infusion protein) is a novel interleukin-15 (IL-15) superagonist complex and has received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BCG-unresponsive CIS non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).\n\nThe company’s platforms are based on the foundation of four separate modalities: Antibody cytokine fusion proteins, synthetic immunomodulators, second-generation human adenovirus (hAd5) and yeast vaccine technologies, and state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf natural killer cells, including autologous and allogenic cytokine-enhanced memory NK cells. ImmunityBio is currently developing a dual construct COVID-19 vaccine candidate using its hAd5 platform. The company has established GMP manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell manufacturing expertise and ready-to-scale facilities, as well as extensive and seasoned R&D, clinical trial, and regulatory operations and development teams.
