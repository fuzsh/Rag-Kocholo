Murff, born in South Carolina, in 1784. Gene- alogy is the science of investigating the descent of a person, or a family, from an ancestor, and genealogy is also the ac- counting of such descent, or one’s pedigree. Randolph S. Murff was the father of twelve children, and he was the ancestor of many descendants, so to be able to present some- thing like a complete genealogical history, and to give an accounting of Randolph S. Murff’s many descendants, meant that the name and some kind of a record of all of these de- scendants, had to be found and recorded. This writer has found and compiled much data concerning Randolph S. Murff and his many descendants, and now an accounting of such findings are presented here in this book. Six of Randolph’s twelve children married and remained t South Carolina to rear their families, The other six Murfif children married in S. C., and migrated to Mississippi to make their homes. Children and descendants of these orig- inal twelve Murff children, soon scattered to many other states, and descendants of Randolph S. Murff have been re- corded from almost every state in the union. To find and record these many descendants of Randolph S. Murff’s, has been a tremendous task, but with the won- derful help and cooperation of many of these descendants, this writer has been able to locate, and record something like 3600 Murff descendants. The recording of a descendant, in this case, consisted of obtaining the name, the birth date, if deceased, then the date of death and where buried, and if married, to whom married and the date, etc. Then this information has been entered, or recorded in this book, as a personal family record of these different Murff descen- dants. Really, it could be said that this book is nothing more than just a family register—a register where the personal family record of Randolph S. Murff’s many descendants are recorded. It should be explained that the parents of Randolph S. Murff are unknown to this writer. Many hundreds of let- térs of inquiries have been written, professional genealogist have been employed from time to time, and hundreds of Murff descendants personally interviewed, and all efforts to find out who the parents of Randolph S. Murff were met with failure. It might be well to devote some time and space here, and present bits of early Morff-Murph-Murff AVAYAAY to ygoissiteg oii inassig of at Hood edt 3 u edT { 20a) STE ai enilow? divo® mi ae 1M e riglobasA = Sf 8 lo tasneob ant gritegttzovat 2 9 , “96 ous gi ypoleunog bas toteeans a6 teal Vliost 3 % My z dglobrs5 aorpibeg 2'500 10 ae ee Ye i j edt enw od bes .seblido sviewst to tetst 9 gamez troesiq o} olds od of oe atuebe 30290 Ve ap 9via of baa .vuoteid {s stolen . sepert ,ztesbaoocsb yrsns 2 2 dqalobush lo yok -#h stort to fis to bios98 5 to bysint fo ge OSL Pi asd wiiaw aidT bob09:91 brs basset od a einer ‘ i\" & eH grintsoqos sigh fowm baliqsroy ba ae fay y Ye soos ab won bas etasbassesh ytens ate § ood ai} ab arsd hetrossuy ots ap beniamor brs bsimam nothlide oviswé e'dqiobaeh to xia iiiwM xia cariio off .zoiltmst sbod) 197-03. eniiorg divo@ gi | ky. ot iqqieeivaill o} botaipicn Bas 4 io ea eh > Se nite a2siit Lo aianbeceyy ere qedjo. yasm of bow saroanlisis 2 Pu fag ism deylieiis 54 aged oved Tin.

The first Morffs-Murphs-Murffs that came to America, were found to be living in the St. Matthews-Orangeburg District of South Carolina. This was a Swiss-German set- tlement at that time. It was also learned that when Gen. Sherman’s army marched through the South, they burned and destroyed many public buildings and public records. This was true of the Orangeburg District of S.C. So for this reason, it has been very difficult—almost impossible to find records and data of these early settlers in this District of South Carolina. Our early Murff family data is almost nil. In speaking of the Murff family, a professional genealo- gist of Columbia, S. C., had this to say, “The family is of Swiss-German descent, and the original records are usually spelled Morf-Morff. Today in S. C., many of the family spell the name Murph”. Tradition has it that soon after the Revo- lutionary War, one of the early Morffs wanted all the family to change the spelling of the name to Murff. Some did change it to be spelled Murff, while others spelled it Murph. It is generally believed by all who have made a study of the family history, that all American Morffs-Murphs-Murffs de- scend from the first five Morffs that came to America. Morffs are first found to be living in Switzerland, and ~ Morffs are yet found to be living there. This fact is known from letters received from a Morff now living in N. J., but who was born in Switzerland, and who has relatives yet living there. A Swiss genealogist furnishes a picture of a grave-marker with the name of a Morff, and the date of 1331, inscribed upon it. This same Swiss genealogist also sends a sketch of a coat of arms. This coat of arms belongs to, “The Zurich Morffs”, the family of Regula Morff, of 1711. For the Ameri- can Morffs-Murphs-Murffs to be eligible to adopt, and use this coat of arms, one would first have to prove, step by step, and beyond a doubt, that he did descend from “The Zurich Morffs”. This writer did not attempt to make such proof. Among the new-comers to America, prior to 1750, were three Morff brothers: Hans Ulrich Morff, Hans Jacob Morff and Felix Morff. These brothers settled in the St. Matthews- Orangeburg District of South Carolina. This is known from data found in “Sallys History of Early S. C.”, and from a few old Church records that were saved from destruction by Gen. Sherman’s army. Some of the Church records reveal the following information.

C.), Hans Henry Westline and Barbara, widow of Hans Ulrich Morff, deceased, both of this Township, were married. Being present were, Henry Hayes, Jasper Kuhn and Peter Moorer.” “On the 5th day of June, 1750, in the Church of Orange- burg, by Hans Jacob Morff and Christina Hessy, both of this Township, being present were—Michael C. Rowe and Hans George Hessy”. | “Christina, wife of Jacob Morff, sponsered Baptism ot Church to Miriam Hanesworth—April 7, 1751.” “April 15, 1750, in the Church of Orangeburg (S. C.), Easter Communion by Felix Morff and wife”. So we find Hans Ulrich, Hans Jacob and Felix Morffs, in the Orangeburg District, of South Carolina, prior to 1750. In 1770, John and Rudolph (Rudy) Morfs entered a North Carolina port. One account says they were from Munich, Germany, while another account says they were from Zurich, Switzerland. Rudy was married to Margaret Niceler on board ship, or soon upon landing. These three immediately made their way to the Swiss-German settlement in the Orangeburg District of S.C. John and Rudy now make five Morffs in S. C. by 1770. Land grants: “John Morf—100 a. on Little River, in Craven County, S. C., Sept. 14, 1771”. “John Morf—200 a. St. Matthews Township, S. C., Aug. 14,1771”. “Felix Morff—100 a. on Four Holes, Orangeburg Town- ship, S. C., Nov. 6, 1751”. F “Roody Murph—150 a. St. Matthews Parish, S. C., April Lragve’. “Rudolph Morf—180 a. St. Matthews-Orangeburg Parish, S. C., Nov. 6, 1786”. The 1790 U.S. Census record, from upper Orangeburg District of S. C., shows a Rudy Morf as head of a house-hold, and his census record reveals his family as consisting of the following: “2 males over 16 yrs. old—2 males under 16 yrs. of age, and 1 female”. One of these males under 16 could neve parr our Randolph S. Murff, who was born in 1784, in S.C. e All data used in this book is presumed to be authentic, because, it was obtained from County and State records, U. , ie Jo doiur!D eff mi, ri sted bw site en vit o19W atone airit rh ‘ited 4 ) dod phim anivanna’) bas oN dese ano yd ae hits awa . foe dorMl—staw cit 3 i d ; 1 apitgesa beren Thom deck to atv - “deri ,¢ lasqa—dlaoee 7 C3 B) pt 5 ane lo dowd edt ai tiw bos ito rita his itt brs dag oom acid Q Cot Teitg .stitlovg’ ee eto ce : dis e heaane AsoM (ybul) Agfobus bis fgiauM cow stew yar altss !norog anO Bates dfatisS wot erew yet ave fotos tedivns oti | ae telsoi jsiéyie Ni of beige caw You “Baal viaisibasuni sod? szotT gaihina! rdqu s002 Ie, st mi jinsmsitive riage eau dd} ot yew weds ov sm wor ybuAl bas not, ete join) tC mae OT vd De mi jsvit slftit mo » RT ae pu :aéceetg, Bexscl CPOTE BE D2 wate mevet guA .o 2 qiderwol mihi i 8 G08. ayant ae aD! -fwoTt yrvdegriexO 29l0H ty0F no 6 Of! tse xile't” ie icy ee VOM, “J £ qitte lngé 5.2 geist ewortisl 12 9 OCR —cigqu voy era ama. i $4210M dale nttiderner( - evo Bt aT Vartond se nod ea HOM + ie apt te) — = z Ee \"ie eg - Ju (A SO ge sa é a Baba iA * + x ~~. * f 4 sae 4 : 3 ec.

This writer has on file, all letters from individuals, letters from County and State, and from U. S. census records, to substantiate all names, dates and all other data and information that is used in this book. It should be explained at this time, that variations in the spelling of a name, and a variation in dates could easily occur. In a few instances names and dates that\\are found in census records, and in County and State records, do not agree with the names and dates that are recorded in family Bibles. Sometimes names and dates that are found on grave-markers do not agree with the family Bible record. Possibly there could be other slight variations in the spelling of a name and in dates, because: in many instances a mother, father, or some one member of a family, would copy the family record from the family Bible, and send to this writer. Slight errors could have been made in copying these names and dates. Then, too, this writer has tran- scribed these many thousands of names and dates two and three times, and he, too, is subject to mistakes same as others. Before getting into the genealogical history, it would be well to read, carefully, the instructions that are to follow. INSTRUCTIONS This book is divided into chapters. Chapter No. 1 is for Randolph S. Murff’s own family record, then Randolph’s twelve children will each be given a chapter. For instance: Wyly Murff is given chapter No. 3, and that chapter is de- voted entirely to giving his own family record, and the family record of each of his many descendants. Each one of Randolph S. Murff’s many descendants is given a place in the history for his, or her own family record —such as the name, birth date, marriage and children, etc. To enable a descendant to more easily find his, or her family record, a code number is used. These code numbers run in consecutive order from No. 1 to No. 3343. No. 1 is Ran- dolph S. Murff’s code number, and the last Murff descendant recorded has No. 3343. Data, other than just the name, was not obtainable on some two hundred descendants. These descendants were not given a code number, and a place in the history, but their names will be found under their parents family record. The pages of this book are numbered, but these page numbers are never referred to, or used.

These code numbers are placed along, up and down, in the left hand margin of the pages. At the back of this book will be found an index of names, alphabetically arranged. In this index of names will be found the names of Randolph S. Murff’s descendants, and the names of these descendants’ husbands, or wives, which- ever the case may be. Just following each name in the index, will be found a number. This number is the code number of that particular descendant. The husbands and wives of these Murff de- scendants are given the same code number as that of their mate. To find your name and your family record in the book: turn to the index and find your name—maiden name if fe- male. Next, get your code number that follows your name— now turn back into the book until you find your number— out in the left hand margin of the page, and there you will find your name and your own family record. When you have found your name and place in the book, you will note a number—just following your name, that is enclosed in parenthesis. This number is the code number of your parent that is the Murff descendant. By using these numbers, one can trace his lineage on back to the parent, the grand parent, and on back, back, back. When you have located your parents family record, you will note a number just in front of each of their children’s names—these numbers are your code numbers. If a descendant finds that his, or her name has been spelled incorrectly, or an error in birth dates, etc., it is sug- gested you do not try to erase, but use a good pen and ink and draw one or two lines through error, then make cor- rection by printing, neatly, above error, the correction. Symbols: b. means born—d. means died—m. means mar- ried. These symbols will be used many times in this book. featie me alas —sitac wey ewollod ted! i ae oe pr 19g an eres oa . ) ao awe ain brad ote ood gilt evi soalg bes arrtien Woy bao? avai slog ral at ject smen woy guiwoilat dau se 2 Sto va Poet weirs shoo sult 2i sedinue idl riaadineseg mi beemious seo! yates va texcbnoxesb Tw ody af tedt 4 TY Bo jesirng oft of Yosd oo agnentil. did aoett med ono , Aokd load seed no bes tasseq brs grit BOY dione: vitmisk atagved wi08y Detnool eved BOY neHW Pins tied) to pone to Soot!

MURFF 1. Randolph S. Murff was born Dec. 2, 1784, somewhere in South Carolina. This birth date is from the old Murff family Bible that was located in S. C. Data from the 1880 U. S. census of two sons, Minus H. Murff (1601), and John R. Murff (2361), shows that their father, Randolph S. Murff, was b. in South Carolina. Beginning with 1880, the U. S. Census required that the State in which parents were born be given. It is not known just where in the State of S. C. Randolph was born, and neither is it known who his parents were. A professional genealogist, Mr. Andrea, of Columbia, S. C., tells this writer that his find- ings concerning Randolph S. Murff were, “That Randolph did live, and at one time he owned land in the St. Mat- thews-Orangeburg Dist. of S. C., before moving to Lau- rens Co., S. C. to make his home, and as to who his parents were, and where he came from to the St. Mat- thews-Orangeburg Dist., he (Mr. Andrea) did not know”. Mr. Andrea further states that, “All public buildings and records in this district were burned and destroyed by Gen. Sherman’s Army, when this army marched through the South, and for this reason we may never know who the father of Randolph was”. Randolph S. Murff was first married to Martha Caro- line (Patsy) Gaines, probably in 1808, for the old Murff family Bible records show that their first child, Catherine (Caty) G. Murff, was born Jan. 10, 1809. Patsy Gaines was the daughter of Rev. Richard George Gaines, and Frances Broaddus (daughter of Edward Broaddus of the Virginia Broaddus family). Richard Geo. Gaines was b. in 1760, and was the son of Rev. Henry Gaines, and Ann George. Rev. Henry was b. in 1734, and was the son of James Gaines, and Mary Pendleton. There are many other known steps back in the Gaines line, but since this is not a Gaines family history, we leave the rest for the Gaines family historians. Richard George Gaines and Frances, were both born in Culpepper Co., Va., and were married there before migrating to Pickens Co., S. C: to make their home, in 1790. We use this Gaines family data here because: at least a thousand Murff descendants that are recorded here in this book, are descendants of Martha Caroline (Patsy) Gaines, first wife of Randolph S.

C. Neither is it known, for sure, just where she was buried. An excerpt from a letter that was written Nov. 1, 1926, by Miss Mary Murff (1649), and her father, Wiley Minus Murff (1610), to a Mr. Triest Wood, of New Or- leans, La., gives the following information, “An old wo- man, Miss Nell Mattison, who lives near the Gaines Cemetery, said that many years ago, a Mrs. Patsy Murff was buried in this cemetery, but we could not find her grave”. This old cemetery was abandoned many years ago, and but very few grave-markers were ever erected there. It is known that Martha Caroline Gaines died between Oct. 5, 1812 (date of birth of her last child, Ma- linda), and Feb. 28, 1816 (date of her husband, Randolph’s 2nd marriage). The Gaines Cemetery is located in Abbe- ville Co., S.C. From Pickens Co., S. C. Court records: Rev. Richard Geo. Gaines, Methodist Minister, and originally from Lau- rens Co., S. C., in his will signed Nov. 22, 1829, mentions, “My grand children, Caty G. Murff, Wyly Murff, and Ma- linda Murff, being children of my deceased daughter, Patsy C. Murff”. Randolph S. Murff and Martha Caroline (Patsy) rage ass were the parents of the following children: 2. Catherine (Caty) G. Murff. 77. Wyly Murff. 429. Malinda Murff. : (Note: For the individual record of each of these chil- dren, turn until you find their code number, No. 2 for Caty, No. 77 for Wyly, and No. 429 for Malinda). Randolph S. Murff was married a 2nd time, Feb. 28, 1816, to Elizabeth Hannah (or Hanna), who was born Feb. 1, 1791, in Hanover Co., Va. This marriage is recorded in the old Murff family Bible. The 1880 census record reveals the fact that two sons, Minus H. Murff, and John R. Murff, gave their mother (Elizabeth Hannah) as being born in Va., and a traditional family saying runs like this “Elizabeth Hannah from Hanover, Va”. Very little is known concerning the Hannah family. Elizabeth did have at least one brother, Thomas Hannah, b. Dec. 15, 1788, and the name on his tomb stone is spelled, H-a-n-n-a. Thomas Hanna and his wife, Priscilla Craft, are both buried in the old Smith Methodist Church Cemetery, in # Setvedtsied yerlto pe $i ,b di batssel ai yisieingD ese § ave veh sebyoost iitieD 2, tek mronst panty. 30 brs watatiai saniae f os AISI SS oo bauble weil asi Naha Fo Ps fas 21M vy aitdiT ated, othune | Yate ‘Api due havsadeo vit lo parubitits gniss Be ‘ye, Ponte (aie) sailors offing bye liawM 2 agiok i ay, . othlivis aniwoliyt ott lo sid ale | bier as.

Thomas and Priscilla were the parents of John and Craft Hanna. The Laurens Co., S. C. land records show that Randolph S. Murff had 192 acres of land surveyed out for himself, in 1823, on the east side of the Saluda River, about four or five miles north of Ware Shoals, S.C. This land is in what was known as, “The Old Brewerton Settlement’, and is today known as the “Harmony Methodist Church Community”. Randolph built the customary, old two room log house, on this land. As his family increased, the house was added onto until it soon was a two story home, with four rooms. This old house is yet standing, and a nice family now living in it. Randolph’s near neighbors were: the James Medlock family, the John Knights, the Beeks, the Pucketts, and two families of Wares. Randolph S. Murff was a wagon maker, and a wood worker by trade. Tradition has it that Randolph’s neighbor, John Knight, was a “mule raiser”, and by the time Randolph Murff would have a new wagon made and ready for sale, John Knight would have a team of mules “broke to work”, and ready to go. The mules would be hitched-up to the new wagon, and Randolph and John would drive down to Au- gusta, Ga., about 60 or 70 miles distance—to a better market, and sell the lot—the mules, the wagon, and the harness. ~ Randolph S. Murff died in 1833, but there was no estate settlement until 1836. His eldest son, Wyly Murff, was ap- pointed the administrator. Wyly Murff and Randolph’s 2nd, wife, Elizabeth Hannah Murff, signed all legal papers. These papers are recorded in Probate Court, Laurens Co., S. C. Below is a copy of the inventory of Randolph S. Murff’s estate: Appraisel bill of goods and chattles of Randolph S.

Space will not permit giving that list. Randolph S. Murff’s children by 2nd marriage, were all minors at time of this estate settlement. The date of the estate settlement was, Jan. 23, 1836. The widow, Elizabeth Hannah Murff, retained her portion of the estate, and also her minor children’s portions. The three children by Ran- dolph’s first marriage to Patsy Gaines, were legally of age, and were given their portion of the estate settlement money at this time. An excerpt from these estate settlement papers reveals the following information: Wyley Murff, for years work retained $110.00 Silas Medlock, a legatee deceased, pd. in full. 123.85 Malinda Murff, a legatee, pd. in full 123.85 Also on record in Laurens Co., S. C., is the estate settlement of Randolph S. Murff’s 2nd wife, Elizabeth Hannah Murff, after her death in 1876. Her son Minus H. Murff was ap- pointed the administrator to settle up this estate. There is on record the customary inventory of the property, and its appraised value. This appraisal was made and signed by, W. C. Balentine, J. F. Saxon and John Cluck. Space will not permit a full account of this estate settlement, but it will ke interesting to mention some of the sales—from the sale-list, and the price paid, and who purchased these items: T. R. Wood bought 1 wagon at $1.25, 1 oven 30c, 1 grind- stone 40c, 1 reel 35c, 1 lot of dishes 60c.

Murff and Elizabeth Hannah Murff. Uriah Milton was deceased at time of estate settlement). Randolph S. Murff died Sept. 4, 1833, and was buried in the old Murff Cemetery, which is located on the original 192 acres of land that was surveyed out for him. This cemetery is about one and a half mile, west of the Harmony Methodist Church, in Laurens Co., S. C., and is near the old Randolph S. Murff home. This cemetery is now abandoned and out in the middle of a pasture—not fenced—cattle and horses tramp over the graves, pushing over and breaking the grave- markers. The last grave made here was that of Elizabeth Hannah Murff, in 1876. The old cemetery is in a very bad condition. . Elizabeth Hannah Murff died June 10, 1876, and was buried beside her husband, Randolph S. Murff, in the above mentioned cemetery. Randolph S. Murff and Elizabeth Han- nah Murff were the parents of the following children: 894. Helena Murff. 1243. Waldemar Murff. 1601. Minus Hillary Murff. 2231. Uriah Milton Murff. 3343.

Catherine (Caty) Gaines Murff (1) the daughter of Ran- dolph S. Murff, and Martha Caroline (Patsy) Gaines, was b. Jan. 10, 1809, in S.C. This birth date is recorded in the old Murff family Bible record. The Murff family Bible only records the name as Caty G. Murif. The Gaines family historian, Rev. Edgar W. Davis, of Greenwood, S. C., furnishes the following information: “Randolph S. Murff was m. to Caroline (Patsy) Gaines, and they were the parents of the following children: Catherine Gaines Murff, Wyly Murff and Malinda Murff. Catherine was affectionately called “Caty” pronounced Katy. Information from the Gaines family data also reveals that Catherine, or Caty Murff, was m. to Silas Medlock. The m. date is not known, but this writer would place the date at about 1826. Caty was not old enough for marriage sooner—she was only 17 yrs. of age in 1826. This date of 1826 is also used because: Caty’s only known child, An- derson Medlock, was born probably in the later part of 1826, or early in 1827. The 1850 U. S. census record is used to bear this statement out. A copy of the 1850 census record was obtained from Washington, D. C., and it re- veals the following information: Laurens District—Nov. 12, 1850. Name age real est. born Anderson Medlock 24 $600 Bx. Mary Medlock 20 S.C, Frank Medlock 1 S.C. It is not known if Caty Murff Medlock had more than the one known son. Information found in the estate settle- ment papers of Caty’s father, Randolph S. Murff, shows that Caty died early in her married life. These estate papers were dated, Jan. 23, 1836, and an excerpt from these papers give the following information: Wyly Murff, for years work, retained $110.00 Silas Medlock, a legatee deceased, pd. in full 123.85 Malinda Murff, a legatee, paid in full 123.85 ro 1s excerpt from the estate settlement papers reveals the act that there was a legatee deceased, prior to 1836. The excerpt shows that Wyly Murff and Malinda Murff a legatee, both received their portion of the estate settle- athe: Rash @ brs RFR sattigush oflt (f) Tau gai d (x2 saa bs yoriae (yxisl) gnilomss br ti bebroos zi cish Ajzid etl GHEE yiiers?

The excerpt also shows that Silas Medlock, the husband of Caty Murff, received the deceased legatee’s portion of the estate settlement money. So it must be presumed that the deceased legatee was none other than our own Catherine (Caty) Gaines Murff. The fact that Silas Medlock was given his wife’s portion of the money, indicates that his wife, Caty, was the mother of at least one child. The exact date of Catherine (Caty) Murff Medlock’s death is not known, but it was prior to 1836. She was probably buried in the old Gaines Cemetery, which was not far from the old Randolph Murff home. So far as this writer was able to determine, from the - great amount of Medlock data that was obtained, Catherine (Caty) Murff Medlock only had the one known child, who was: | 3. Anderson Medlock. Since this chapter is devoted in giving the history of Caty Murff, and her descendants, we next use her child, Anderson Medlock, whose code number is No. 3. 3. Anderson Medlock (2) the only known child of Caty Murff, was b. about 1826. (See 1850 U. S. census record that is given in his mother’s, Caty’s, family record). He was m. to Mary Andrews about 1848, for their first child, Frank, was born in 1849, according to 1850 census record. In searching the land transfer records of Laurens Co., S. C., it is found that on Jan. 20, 1886, Anderson Medlock transferred 57 acres of land to John Randolph Murff, for $519.75. This indicates he was yet living at that date. Anderson Medlock and his wife, Mary, were both buried in the Mount Bethel Church Cemetery, and there is no monument at their graves. (Information by grandson, Lee Eston Medlock). Anderson Medlock and Mary An- drews had the following children: 4. William Franklin Medlock. 5. Matilda Jane Medlock. 6. Marietta (Molly) Medlock. 7. James Stacy Medlock. ‘ 4, William Franklin Medlock (3) was b. May 7, 1849, in Laurens Co., S. C. He was m. to Lou Nash in 1869. She was b. Feb. 14, 1851, and was the daughter of Miles Wash- ington Nash. Lou d. Nov. 14, 1932, and Will Frank d.

Wyly Murff, son of Randolph S. Murff (1), and Martha Caroline (Patsy) Gaines, was b. Nov. 30, 1809, in S. C. Wyly was m. to Frances Stone, in S. C., Nov. 20, 1834. She was b. Feb. 2, 1813. Wyly was made the adminis- trator in settling up his father’s estate. Wyly and his step-mother, Elizabeth Hannah Murff, signed all legal papers pertaining to the Murff estate, and Wyly always spelled his name, “W-y-l-y”. Laurens Co., S. C., land transfers show Wyly Murff selling 45 acres of land, on the Saluda River, to Cor- nelius Cook, for $365.00. This was on Oct. 19, 1837. Wyly bought 50% acres from William Arnold, Dec. 6, 1841, and again in July, Wyly bought 82% acres more from W. Arnold. On Dec. 22, 1858, Wyly Murff sold to James T. Medlock, 82% acres for $500.00. These land deals were in Laurens Co., S. C. The Monroe Co., Miss., land transfers show that on Feb. 2, 1861, N. H. Dobbs, transfered 123 acres of land to Wyly Murff. In 1872, Wyly Murff bought 160 a. of land from Will P. Cooper. We know from Laurens Co., S. C. land transfers, that Wyly Murff was yet in S. C. on Dec. 22, 1858, for he sold land on that date, to James T. Medlock. We know he was in Monroe Co., Miss., Feb. 2, 1861, for he bought land in that County, on that date. All of Wyly Murff’s children were born in South Carolina—except Wyly Elmore (Ellie), whose birth date was probably in 1860, and the birth place was given as Miss. Records in Evans Memorial Library, Aberdeen, Miss., show Wyly Murff as being, Sgt. Co. K. 2nd State Troops, Miss. Inf., during the War between the States. Wyly’s wife, Frances, d. May 15, 1870, and Wyly d. Oct. 30, 1891. Both are buried in Prospect Cemetery, Monroe Co., Miss. Wyly’s half-sister, Helena Murff Smith (894), died the same day that Wyly did, then they were buried the same time—a double funeral. Wyly and Frances’ children: 78. Frances (Frank) Malinda Murff. 79. Martha Elizabeth Murff. 80. Nancy Catherine (Kate) Murff. 81. Randolph Smith Murff. 7 sas em ie \" | a, (i) Hsu 2 Aqiobash to mo: TeMe ia Me cts: BE vow ae Scat’ (yaieT) seidose. ee 68 vol.
