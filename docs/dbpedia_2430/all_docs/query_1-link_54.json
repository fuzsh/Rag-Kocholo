        "text": "We have a long slow delicious read full of treats for you this month. Child Okeford’s most famous resident celebrates his 75th birthday. He started life as a simple holiday purchase in Blackpool, but the little yellow hand puppet became a national treasure. Editor Laura has fulfilled a lifetime ambition interviewing renowned ethologist, passionate conservationist and inspiring activist Dr Jane Goodall – who answers this month's Random 19 questions. Spoiler alert - Lord of the Rings and a controversial biscuit-dunking policy lay in store. A retrospective at Sladers Yard gallery celebrates the remarkable career of Philip Sutton RA – an artist who has never followed fashion. Fanny Charles interviewed the 94-year-old painter who lives in Dorset and looked back at his life's work Sophie Giles swapped working on an industrial estate for life as an island girl – Tracie Beardsley met Brownsea Island’s youngest ranger, and hears how working on the land has entirely transformed her life."
