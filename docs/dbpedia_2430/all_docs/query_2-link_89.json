        "text": "‘To me he was always the embodiment of Cavalier romance.’ Thus Vita Sackville-West on her seventeenth-century ancestor, Edward Sackville, fourth earl of Dorset. Such labelling indicates the problems which still bedevil any study of Civil War royalism. Brian Wormald's Clarendon brilliantly revealed that the men who joined Charles I in 1642 represented a broad range of opinion. Above all, he made us aware of a coherent group of moderate (‘constitutional’) royalists who throughout sought accommodation. There was a palpable difference of strategy between these people, who favoured royal concessions in order to prevent further military initiatives, and others who favoured military initiatives in order to prevent further royal concessions. Within these two basic matrices, there were further subtle inflections of attitude between individuals and within the same individual over time. But many such inflections remain murky. Wormald's lead was never followed through. Charles's supporters have consistently received less attention than those who remained with parliament; and among the royalists, moderates have attracted fewer studies than ‘cavaliers’ and ‘swordsmen’. There is thus an urgent need to clarify different varieties of royalism and especially to bring the constitutional royalists into sharper focus. However, before we can assess their wider aims and impact, we must first identify them; and here the inappropriate labels bestowed on so many of Charles's supporters create real problems. Anne Sumner has recently ‘de-mythologized’ John Digby, first earl of Bristol, revealing him as more complex and less intemperate than the ‘hawk’ of legend.\n\n3 This bias is apparent in Gardiner, S. R., History of the Great Civil War, 1642–1649 (4 vols., London, 1893Google Scholar; reprinted, 1987), and has not been fully remedied since. On political developments at Westminster during the 1640s we now have major studies such as Underdown, D., Pride's purge: politics in the Puritan revolution (Oxford, 1971)Google Scholar; Worden, B., The Rump Parliament, 1648–53 (Cambridge, 1974)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Yule, G., Puritans in politics (Sutton Courtney, 1981)Google Scholar. The parliamentarian armies are closely analysed in Holmes, C., The Eastern Association in the English Civil War (Cambridge, 1974)Google Scholar; and Kishlansky, M. A., The rise of the new model army (Cambridge, 1979)Google Scholar. Similarly, many of the local studies focus more on parliamentarian than royalist areas: see, for example, Everitt, A., The community of Kent and the great rebellion (Leicester, 1966)Google Scholar; Morrill, J. S., Cheshire 1630–1660: county government and society during the English revolution (Oxford, 1974)Google Scholar; Morrill, J. S., The revolt of the provinces: conservatives and radicals in the English Civil War, 1630–1650 (Longman edn, London, 1980)Google Scholar; Hughes, A., Politics, society and Civil War in Warwickshire, 1620–1660 (Cambridge, 1987)CrossRefGoogle Scholar. The less substantial literature on royalism is briefly reviewed in the next note. This historiographical imbalance is also discussed in Hutton, R., The royalist war effort, 1642–1646 (Harlow, 1982), pp. xi–xviGoogle Scholar.\n\n4 Apart from Wormald's study, there is only one post-war biography of Clarendon: Harris, R. W., Clarendon and the English revolution (London, 1983)Google Scholar. This compares with four of Prince Rupert: Fergusson, B. E., Rupert of the Rhine (London, 1952)Google Scholar; Thomson, G. M., Warrior prince: Prince Rupert of the Rhine (London, 1976)Google Scholar; Morrah, P., Prince Rupert of the Rhine (London, 1976)Google Scholar; and Ashley, M., Rupert of the Rhine (London, 1976)Google Scholar; and with one of Hopton: Edgar, F. T. R., Sir Ralph Hopton: the king's man in the west, 1642–52 (Oxford, 1968)Google Scholar. Rupert's ubiquity owes much to the ready availability of Memoirs of Prince Rupert and the cavaliers, ed. Warburton, E. (3 vols., London, 1849)Google Scholar. In recent years, several works on the recruitment, membership and organization of royalist armies have appeared, notably Newman, P. R., Royalist officers in England and Wales, 1642–1660: a biographical dictionary (London, 1981)Google Scholar; Hutton, War effort; and Malcolm, J., Caesar's due: loyalty and King Charles, 1642–6 (London, 1983)Google Scholar. By contrast, there are no biographies of royalist moderates such as the duke of Richmond, the marquess of Hertford, the earls of Dorset, Southampton and Lindsey, Sir John Culpepper and Sir John Strangeways. Nor do we have any account of their collective involvement in peace negotiations. Mendle, M., Dangerous positions: mixed government, the estates of the realm, and the making of the answer to the XIX propositions (Alabama, 1985)Google Scholar, is valuable on the ideological context, but deals with political theory rather than practice; while our knowledge of the royalist party at Oxford in 1642–6 is limited to a tightly focused debate on its composition, examined below, p. 819. I am currently preparing a monograph on the nature and significance of constitutional royalism before and during the Civil Wars.\n\n114 That three of these four speeches are apocryphal may be demonstrated as follows. The first speech – The Earle of Dorset his Speech for Propositions of Peace, Delivered to His Majesty at Oxford on January 18 [1642/3] (London, 1643)Google Scholar, Wing, D 1951; B.L., T.T., E 85/44 – exactly reproduces a speech attributed to the duke of Richmond and Lennox in 1639. See P.R.O., SP 16/537/147–149 (copies of speech by Richmond and Lennox); Bod. Lib., MS Tanner 299 (Archbishop Sancroft's transcriptions), fols. 184r–185r. This last copy bears a later note that Richmond and Lennox disowned the speech. I am grateful to Professor Russell for alerting me to this fact, of which I was regrettably unaware when I completed my doctoral dissertation: see , Smith, ‘Dorset’, pp. 368–70Google Scholar. Further evidence against the authenticity of this speech is afforded by the fact that the privy council appears not to have met on 18 Jan. 1643: P.R.O., PC 2/53, pp. 209–15. The second and third speeches were printed as Two Speeches Spoken at Oxford by the Right Honourable Edward Earle of Dorset… The One at his receiving the office of Lord Privy Scale. The other at his being made President of His Majesties Councell (London, 1643)Google Scholar, Wing D 1952; B.L., T.T., E 83/45. This is clearly false because Dorset never held either of these offices. The fourth speech, printed in Two Speeches Spoken at the Councell Table at Oxford. The One, by the Right Honourable John, Earle of Bristoll… The Other, by the Right Honourable Edward, Earle of Dorsett (London, 1642), pp. 6–8Google Scholar (Wing, B 4798; B.L., T.T., E 83/19), was ‘reprinted at London for Iohn Hanson’, ostensibly from an original ‘printed at Oxford by Leonard Lichfield’. Madan, Falconer, Oxford books: a bibliography of printed books relating to the university and city of Oxford (3 vols., Oxford, 1895–1931), II, 197Google Scholar, states that ‘the original Oxford edition probably never existed’. The fact that neither of these speeches bears a date also casts doubt on their authenticity. Sheila Lambert's view (in a private communication to the author) is that ‘whether the speeches were actually genuine or not, the pamphlet may have been officially inspired from Oxford’. I have as yet seen no evidence which proves conclusively whether or not they are genuine. For an analysis of their contents, see , Smith, ‘Dorset’, pp. 370–3Google Scholar. I am most grateful to Sheila Lambert and to John Adamson for advice on this pamphlet. For a discussion of similar forgeries during the early 1640s, see Cromartie, A. D. T., ‘The printing of parliamentary speeches, November 1640–July 1642’, Historical Journal, XXXIII (1990), 23–44Google Scholar.\n\n124 P.R.O., C 231/3, p. 74. This commission represented a significant hardening of royalist war policy. Dorset and six others were required to find out which parliamentarians ‘have any landes, tenementes or other hereditamentes, goodes, money, plate, cattell or chattells, or any debtes owing unto them within… Ox[fordshire], Berk[shire] or Buck[inghamshire] or any of them, and to seize and sequester the same into the handes of fitt and able persons to be by them assigned and appointed… And the moneys and profittes arising hereby to be paid into the Receipt of the Exchequer’. The commission was renewed on 14 May, and given full authority to compound with delinquents on 9 Nov.: P.R.O., C 231/3, pp. 112, 114. Between 27 Apr. 1644 and 23 Feb. 1646, Dorset paid a total of £3,785 14s. 10d. into the exchequer under the terms of this commission: P.R.O., E 401/1928 (exchequer of receipt, Pells receipt book, 1643–5), unfol., 13, 20 Apr. 1644, 29 Mar., 25 Aug., 27 Sept. 1645, 23 Feb. 1645/6; E 401/1929 (exchequer of receipt, Pells issue book, 1644), pp. 1, 7, 17, 20, 25, 29, 36. For the role of this commission in the king's financial administration, see Engberg, J., ‘Royalist finances during the English Civil War, 1642–6’, Scandinavian Economic History Review, XIV (1966), 73–96CrossRefGoogle Scholar, especially 92–4."
