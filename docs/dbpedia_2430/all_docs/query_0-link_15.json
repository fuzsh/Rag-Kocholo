        "text": "§ The Prime Minister\n\nWell, I am giving the facts as I gathered them from the speech my right hon. Friend made yesterday. [HON. MEMBERS \"Answer.\"] Exports of coal, as I said, will be sharply 1494 —[HON. MEMBERS: \"You do not know?\"] I do not mind at all being interrupted. I think the habit of disorderliness which I have noticed on the benches opposite recently only shows what guilty consciences hon. Members have. The aim at the end of the year—[HON. MEMBERS: \"Answer.\"]—the aim at the end of this year—[HON. MEMBERS: \"Answer.\"] I will not answer a question if I do not choose. You distinguish yourselves by denying me a fair hearing. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Answer.\"] I could not have been making a simpler or plainer statement of what was said of our policy yesterday as announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nBy increased sales of military equipment we expect to earn another £10 million this year. All this was said yesterday, and then it was argued that no effective statement had been made. As a matter of fact—[Interruption.] I am not apparently allowed to adduce and define the statement to show that that assumption which has been so impatiently made by hon. Gentlemen opposite is as devoid of foundation as many of their other dogmas.\n\nThese measures to strengthen our reserves and to increase confidence in our resolve to maintain solvency must not be viewed by them selves alone. Apart from their beneficial effect upon the United Kingdom economy, they are the preliminary to the economic conference of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers which I announced to the House yesterday and which is to open here on 25th November. At this conference the whole position of the sterling area will be searchingly reviewed and we shall enter upon the discussions all the stronger for the action we are taking now.\n\nVarious questions were asked yesterday about the conference. It will be a meeting of Prime Ministers and, in accordance with custom, I shall preside. But I shall, of course, have the help of my colleagues who are directly concerned with the special matters under discussion. The preparations for this conference concern a number of Ministers, including particularly the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade. These preparations, which are already in hand, are being supervised on my behalf by the 1495 Foreign Secretary in his capacity as Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke yesterday mainly about the civil economy. It falls to me to speak more at length about defence. One of our greatest problems in the hard discussions which we have had has been that of finding means by which, despite our economic difficulties, we can still maintain a defence effort in accordance with our duties and our needs. We shall not weaken in our resolve to do our utmost in the defence of the free democracies. We reaffirm our determination to stand fast with the Commonwealth, with the United States and our other Allies, in resisting the encroachments of Communism. In particular, in the West, we are resolved to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States and our Allies in Europe in resisting any aggression.\n\nBut there can be no assurance of lasting military strength without a firm economic foundation, and no defence programme can stand without the economic resources to carry it through. The defence programmes must be kept within the limits of our economic strength. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Leeds, South (Mr. Gaitskell) seemed to suggest that no review or revision of our armament scheme could be undertaken by us except in conjunction with all the other Allied Powers.\n\nI trust indeed that we shall continue to set an example to the European States and no doubt when the meetings of N.A.T.O. take place in the autumn we shall all discuss together our common affairs and how we have got on. But to suggest, as the right hon. Gentleman did, that we have no right to make necessary or even beneficial changes in our own military organisation and expenditure without a general meeting of all the N.A.T.O. Powers would be an abrogation of our rights and an alteration of our ordinary practice such as I have not hitherto seen in peace or war.\n\nLet me now look back a little. Two years ago, after the outbreak of the war in Korea, the Socialist Government, with praiseworthy zeal but little study, announced a re-armament programme of £3,600 million to cover both new equipment and the maintenance of the Forces, spread over three years. Five months 1496 later, for reasons which were not made clear at the time, they raised this figure to £4,700 million. Now, by the decline in the purchasing power of the pound, it would be about £5,400 million.\n\nThe original £4,700 million at the old prices was divided by the late Government in their three-year plan as follows: 1951, £1,250 million; 1952, £1,531 million; 1953, £1,694 million, making a total for the three years of £4,475 million, to which they added £225 million for civil defence and stock-piling, thus making up the total of £4,700 million.\n\nI pointed out, however, in December that it would not be possible to complete so vast a scheme in the period prescribed. There are the inevitable time-lags which may be put, in the first two years, at between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. In the first year, 1951, actual expenditure amounted to only £1,132 million as compared with the programme figure of £1,250 million. In the current year, 1952, we expect, though this is nothing more than a very speculative estimate, to spend £1,462 million against the forecast of £1,531 million made by our predecessors. I thought that the House might like to have these figures in their minds.\n\nNevertheless, had we not made a considerable slowing down of the programme to which we had been committed, spreading it into the fourth year, the total bill for these three years would have been far above £4,700 million. Actually, on our present decisions and calculations, we and our predecessors, allowing for the price increase, which has been continuous, will have spent in the three years a sum not far short of the £4,700 million originally proposed.\n\nBut, through the time-lag and increased costs, there will be a short-fall in the results achieved in the first three years. Our resources are not expanding at the rate we need to enable us to recover in any period which can be foreseen the position which we held before the war. As a contribution to the immense new burden of the re-armament plan, we are receiving in this year, 1952, about £175 million from the United States; but this is quite different from the £400 million or £500 million a year enjoyed by the late Government before the arms programme was begun, in loans or gifts from the United States and, to a lesser extent, from Canada and the Commonwealth. It 1497 must never be forgotten that this foreign aid, on which the Socialist Government lived for its whole tenure of power, virtually made good the loss of foreign investments that we suffered at the beginning of the war. Now we are facing the increased burden without having either the one or the other. Now we are striving to repay the American loan with interest.\n\nAll these facts might well, I think, be taken into consideration by all fair-minded people friendly to Britain and her survival. If this cold war ordeal is to continue—and it certainly does not rest with us—we must organise our defences on lines which do not require a constantly expanding expenditure of money and materials over an indefinite period. Within those boundaries, very great improvements and economies, in the true sense of a higher fertility, will be possible, and it is to this that the Ministry of Defence, under Lord Alexander, whose knowledge in all these matters is of the greatest value to us, and the three great Service Departments, are now devoting their unremitting attention.\n\nThe original programme was conceived by the late Government in the mood of the crisis which came upon them when the Korean war began. Many of the resources and much of the equipment in hand at the end of the war had been improvidently dispersed or destroyed. Virtually no new equipment had been provided. For five years the Forces had lived on vanishing war stocks, and there was a heavy lee-way to make up.\n\nRe-armament was such a violent reversal of the policy previously pursued that many errors in the programme were inevitable. Since we assumed office nine months ago, we have made a comprehensive review of defence policy and strategy, and we are now engaged in reshaping the original programme so as to bring it into accord with the results of our new assessment of the position.\n\nThere are two requirements to be met. First, we have to take account of the ceaseless technical developments which affect our preparations for a world war, should such a disaster come upon us. In the two years that have passed since the original programme was launched, some weapons, on which immense sums were to be spent, have become obsolescent, and new types and devices of a greatly improved character have come into view. 1498 These technical advances have resulted in changes in military tactics, and, in turn, changes of emphasis as between the various sectors of the defence production programme.\n\nImmense strides have been made by the United States, not only in their stockpile of atomic weapons, but in the power of atomic weapons, and in the range and accuracy of their delivery. All this is reinforced by the advent of new aircraft which profoundly affect the tactics of air warfare, and anti-air defence. Remarkable progress has also been made in our own development of guided missiles, or guided rockets, as was mentioned by the Minister of Supply the other day. On the other hand, the development, such as it may be, of the atomic weapon by Russia is a factor which, though unknowable, we must increasingly bear in mind.\n\nAt sea, we have to be prepared to meet new and faster types of U-boat and novel methods of mining. All these developments change the picture of the likely course and character of a future war, and many consequential changes are enforced upon the scale and pattern of weapons and equipment required.\n\nWe must not think of a possible third world war in terms of the first, or even the second, of these vast human catastrophes. The days of prolonged artillery bombardment, of immense and almost stationary armies, had vanished before the Second World War came. The expenditure on ammunition in the future may be far less than in the Second World War, and merely to proceed on the previous conventional lines would be to squander our military treasure and our strength.\n\nThese developments have affected the views of our military experts on the character and course of any future struggle, and this process of change continues, and even accelerates, with the remorseless march of the science of human destruction.\n\nThe second requirement we may have to meet is the continuance of armed peace or cold war, as forecast by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison), for a prolonged period. The technical developments which I have just mentioned will not help us much in that. It is by more conventional armaments, mainly, in fact, by the infantry soldier 1499 serving in so many parts of the world, that we have to make our current contribution towards security against Communist encroachment.\n\nThe need to maintain this kind of military strength in peace must be balanced against the other need to ensure that, if war comes, we shall be able to meet the first intense phase with all its new inventions. I do not doubt that, if the party opposite had continued in power, they would also have been impelled by these developments to review and recast their original scheme, which we supported.\n\nTo sum up this part of the argument, I would say that, allowing for the time-lag on the one hand, and the increase of costs on the other, we shall in four years have spent more on re-equipment than was proposed by the late Government for three. But the improvements in types of weapons will have enabled many practical economies and reductions to be made in the original programme with a positive increase in war power. Had that original programme been allowed to continue in its expanding course after the third year, the expenditure would have risen enormously beyond our power to bear.\n\nI will repeat in a varied form what I have said before—that a period of rearmament follows the rule: first year, nothing; the second, not much; the third year, more than you can pay for. With the great complexity of modern weapons, and particularly of aircraft, this rule must now to be extended into the fourth and even the fifth year.\n\nIf we had followed up to its logical conclusion the defence programme which we found descending upon us when we took office, in 1954 or 1955 we should have been exposed to enormous increases in expenditure, unforeseen, so far as we know, at the time when the programme was originally launched, and utterly beyond our economic capacity to bear. Even if we had not been called upon at this time to make new efforts to stimulate exports and to reduce the investment programme and social expenditure at home, it would, in any event, have been necessary to grip the whole position in order to prevent the automatic growth of defence expenditure from rising in the third, fourth and fifth years far beyond the limits of our economic strength.\n\n1500 It must be remembered that the process of re-armament is a continuous one. Modern weapons take two or three years to make. Modern aircraft take four or even five years. It is wasteful to the highest degree to spend many months retooling factories for re-armament and moving labour for that purpose, and then, while the weapons are still good and current, to break them up and disperse the labour. Very good reasons must be shown in every case where contracts are modified or cancelled with heavy costs in compensation and ineffectual employment of skilled labour.\n\nIt is the continuity of what we were committed to that I am drawing to the attention of the House. Therefore, although we are varying the programme, for the reasons which I have explained, it is still essentially the programme shaped and put forward by the late Government at a time when the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) was one of its leading Members. Indeed, had he remained responsible, he, and others associated with him, would have had to make some of the changes which we are now making. But in view of the programme on which he helped to launch us, and the great mass of contracts already placed before he left office, he has every right to share the credit, as he shares the responsibility, for what was in the main a timely and patriotic decision.\n\nSo far I have been dwelling on finance. Money, however, is not the only limiting factor in re-armament. Steel and its companion products impose absolute limits, alike on our solvency and on our security. We are importing more than a million tons of steel and pig iron this year, and prospects of an improvement in our outlook next year are not unfavourable. Perhaps that is an under-statement. I hope so. If so, the under-statement may be set against any errors in the opposite direction which I may be considered to make.\n\nThe problem is how exactly the steel available after domestic needs are met should be allocated between defence services and exports, for without a sufficiency of exports, as the House knows and as I have so often said, a collapse of our economic and financial life would overwhelm us. It cannot be dogmatically stated that defence should have absolute priority over exports, or vice versa. Our 1501 supply of steel and various other metals is limited, and it would be equally foolish for the Government to lay it down that either armaments or exports should have an unlimited call on them at the expense of the other. Demands on these materials by those engaged in manufacturing goods for exports have to be carefully weighed one at a time—weighed carefully against our individual defence requirements—and we hope and believe that we can, with patience strike a balance which will build up our defences without endangering our solvency.\n\nWhat applies to steel applies also to the transfer of industrial capacity throughout the metal-using and engineering industries. This diversion of resources from defence to the export drive is just as necessary for our military strength as for our daily lives. Not to make it would be to plunge into bankruptcy. It seems, therefore, and it is true to say, that priority is given to exports over defence, but the sphere in which such transfers will be fruitful is a limited one, and there will still be left a very heavy quantity of steel for the defence programme.\n\nThis process is going on now. Every case is being considered on its merits. I am not going to publish exact figures on these matters; we have no parallel information from Soviet sources. But I may say that, broadly speaking, the decisions we have reached after months of intensive labour will alter the pattern of defence production in a way which will limit its demands on the engineering industry, and in the coming years set free a valuable part of its capacity for the expansion of our civil exports.\n\n§ Mr. Attlee\n\nI am glad that the Prime Minister will now know what the position is as well as the rest of us. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer had no long-term policy to announce, and his speech 1511 merely broadened down platitude to platitude. \"The Times\" summed up the position very well this morning when it said: All this is humdrum fare and it will be scanned in vain by those who are looking for something more inspiring than the spasmodic doses of restriction and prohibition … I am sorry for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was not allowed to say anything, but, also, apparently, he had no long-term proposal to put forward. All we got was that we are to have a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. We all welcome that, but I should like to know what has happened about the meeting of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers that was announced in January. Two committees were set up, one to deal with development and the other with convertibility. Six months is a considerable time, and one would have thought that there would be some results by now, even though one of them is presided over by the Minister of State far Economic Affairs and, naturally, it would walk rather slowly.\n\nWe have made no progress on this and yet these are the matters which are a concern to us all. There has been much discussion in the House on the subject of convertibility and on production and development. We should like to have heard something about that, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer had nothing to report. So we all waited with eagerness for the Prime Minister's statement. I must say I was surprised that we did not have from him any review of the world strategic situation. I should like to know what has become of the hideous gap in Europe, of which we have often heard. What has become of his insistence that we ought to have 80 divisions to hold the West? He even gave particulars of them. Ten were to come from the United States, there were to be 10 or eight from ourselves, two from Canada, and France, her old spirit revived, was to provide 20 or perhaps 15. There are not even 10.\n\nThe fact is that that hideous gap is there and nothing that the right hon. Gentleman has said has altered that fact. I should like to know what are the facts that enable him to come to the House today and put aside his pressing fear, the danger of aggression in Europe from the East. He has switched over to something entirely new, and the present dan- 1512 ger is the economic position. But we have always been face to face with both those dangers.\n\nI should like to know now what has happened since we had the discussions on the Estimates. The Prime Minister always makes a great deal of play by saying that the Labour Government were always changing their mind, that there was one estimate and then later on an expansion. But what has happened now since the Estimates were laid before this House for this year? The detailed programme for the Services was presented not very long ago. Judging by the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer things have become, if not exactly rosy, at least far less black. He gave us the picture that everything was steadily improving. Now we have this sudden change and reversal. I wonder if the Prime Minister agrees with the Chancellor of the Exchequer for their public statements seldom agree. The Prime Minister is full of trapdoors and all those kind of things, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has everlastingly to follow them up and try to cover them up by saying that things are not so bad after all.\n\nBut what is the evidence that relieves us of the dangers which the Prime Minister used to lay before this House with such great eloquence? The Prime Minister suggested that my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, South (Mr. Gaitskell) had said that we should not make any change unless we discussed that with our allies in N.A.T.O. He said nothing of the sort. It would be right, however, that there should be discussions with N.A.T.O. After all, what was the origin of our re-armament proposals? The origin was in collaboration with the other Powers of Western Europe, the United States and Canada to build up a certain force with a definite plan.\n\nIt is quite true that the plan has lagged behind. We have been very, very disappointed in the building up of continental Forces. It is very dangerous. I can glance for a moment at the debate that we are to have during the rest of the week because this is profoundly significant on the question of German rearmament. When we engage to provide a certain amount of armaments and other countries engage to provide certain armaments, obviously it is right that if there 1513 is to be a change that change should be discussed. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has thrown over that conception, on which he used to be so eloquent, of a great Atlantic West European Force.\n\nOur position in these matters has always been perfectly clear. We recognise the need for armed strength in the West. There has been no difference in our ranks on that. We also recognise the need for having regard to our economic stability, and no one has suggested that the position should not be reviewed from time to time. Indeed, it is quite obvious that we had to review it. It is quite obvious, too, that the amounts that can be spent at any given time depend upon the availability of machine tools and raw materials price levels and our general economic situation. Hence we accepted the delay when the defence Estimates were introduced.\n\nIt is obvious we had to review these things from time to time. That does not alter the principle that in considering these matters we have to consider both defence and economic security. But I entirely deny the suggestion of the Prime Minister that our plan was that after three years we should go on piling up armaments higher and higher. We never took that line at all. The line was that while we were making up the basic needs we were bound to have high expenditure, but that this would tail off after three years had elapsed. That has always been the position which we have taken up.\n\nI am rather interested by the Prime Minister's defence of selling arms abroad. It is surprising how difficult he finds it to shake off the old Adam, because in the same breath as he was imploring us to sell arms abroad he was saying how wasteful it was of us to get rid of arms after the last war. At the same time as he says we must not go on with obsolescent arms he deplores the fact that we sold off obsolescent arms at the end of the war.\n\nWhat amuses me is that he used precisely the same argument on the export of arms as I used. I said we had to get rid of obsolescent arms. I said that it was useful to arm our allies and useful to build up industrial potential for the production of arms. And how heartily I was denounced by the right hon. Gentleman. He said it is a shocking thing 1514 to think of selling arms, for base commercial considerations of payment, to people abroad.\n\n§ Mr. Bevan\n\nThis has been discussed so frequently that the knowledge is now elementary. We know very well that there was an absolute decline in the production of coal, because the Conservative policy had poisoned the pits. We could not get people into the pits. No one denies that.\n\nBut I do not want to be deflected from this point; this anxiety is universal, and if Great Britain is to pull herself out of this series of prolonged crises, accompanied by unwholesome debates of this 1530 sort, we can only do it by pursuing a sustained drive to correct the physical facts.\n\nIt is part of my case—and it is not because I have a King Charles' head about it—that that sustained drive must be provided by a Minister who is not necessarily occupied all the time with short-term money accounts. Therefore, I am pleading that there shall be established in Great Britain a Minister for economic expansion, and that that Minister should be made responsible for raw materials.\n\nWhen I was in the Government I implored my right hon. Friend who is now the Leader of the Opposition to pay attention to the increasing shortage of raw materials, and particularly of non-ferrous metals, particularly of sulphur. Once more people are becoming complacent because stocks are up. Why are they up? Because production is down. As soon as we start producing in greater quantities, stocks once more will be exhausted. We have just heard from the United States, following talks about the shortage of raw materials, a very interesting and impressive report about the effect on the American economy of raw materials outside, in which we are told that within a measurable distance, 20 years or so. America will have to import 50 per cent. of her needs in raw materials.\n\nHon. Members must realise that this is a most ominous situation for a manufacturing country like ourselves. My right hon. Friend, when Prime Minister, did recognise the seriousness of the issue sufficiently to appoint a Minister of raw materials. I thought that was a mistake—not because I disagreed with the calibre of the right hon. Gentleman who was put into that office; I have great admiration, affection and respect for him; but that was not the right way to do it, because all he could do would be to run around nervously probing other Departments. And although I know that he could easily make his voice heard, echoes do not reverberate very long in Whitehall.\n\nTherefore, what I am pleading for is that we should have a Minister for British economic expansion who would be responsible for keeping a vigilant eye upon the future—not only tomorrow, not only to talk about what we are to do with a balance of payments crisis in 1952–53, but how Great Britain is to face the 1531 economic crises of the next 25 years or more. And we can do that only by having the right machine.\n\nI made other suggestions. I suggested that the Ministry of Health should be divided, and it was. The Health Department was hived off, and the Ministry of Local Government and Planning was begun. I will make some further suggestions. The difficulty is that we are looking at the Governmental machine only from the point of view of dismissing a few civil servants. That is too shortsighted. We ought to see whether the governmental machine today has been adjusted to the changes that have taken place in governmental functions.\n\nObviously, very many important changes have taken place. Industries have been nationalised and transferred, as to their detailed day-to-day administration, to boards. I therefore suggest it is no use merely having the same Minister for Civil Aviation and Transport. There has been no amalgamation of the Departments. The departments are still there. They still have separate addresses. They still have the same permanent secretaries. There is no amalgamation. It is merely a change of nomenclature. It is not an organic change in the structure of the Departments. I suggest, therefore, that those two Departments be immediately organically amalgamated.\n\nFurthermore, I suggest that the Ministry of Pensions be divided; that the cash paying and appeals machinery be handed over to the Ministry of Labour, that Ministry having plenty of experience of this work and plenty of skilled officers. In the next place, the therapeutical side of the Ministry of Pensions, the hospitals, should be handed over to the Ministry of Health, where it belongs, because a sick soldier is merely a sick individual, and should be passed over to the civil Department until he has recovered and then, if it is required, pass him back to the military. This would save another Department by changes which are administratively desirable.\n\nThen I should hand over the Ministry of National Insurance. I am not suggesting that this will be universally popular. I am sure that my suggestions will not be popular in Whitehall. Nevertheless, let us have a look at them. It seems to 1532 me that we should look at the Ministry of National Insurance at once, because that Ministry has done its main job. It is now a collecting and paying-out concern, with machinery for appeal. There is not the slightest reason why that should not be handed over to the Ministry of Labour which has offices all over the country. Often economies of space could easily be found in the provinces by the use of the same premises. Why not?\n\nIn the next place, I suggest that steel should be handed over to the Ministry of Fuel and Power, because the Minister of Supply is too busy. He has been too mischievous as well as too busy recently. Nevertheless, here we have a huge Department with great administrative difficulties, whereas the Ministry of Fuel and Power have to administer only a Department whose main functions are discharged by statutory boards. Therefore, I would take that away from the Ministry of Supply and hand it over to the Ministry of Fuel and Power.\n\nThen I would take Works and put it into the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Do not let us be kidded, if I may use a colloquialism, by the speeches made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, who says that he has carried his palliasse into the Ministry of Health—sleeping night and day, getting up and working now and again, giving such vigilant attention to the housing drive.\n\nI know enough about the old Ministry of Health to know that the fact is that once one has assembled building materials and building labour the housing programme is an administrative job. The housing programme is a function of the capital investment programme. One can increase the number of houses or reduce the number of houses just as one declares them to be in priority with the rest of the capital investment programme. The fact is that they are both of them half-idle Ministers. Do not let us be kidded by the fact that this crusading spirit occupies no more than a few perorations.\n\nTherefore, I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman, because he has had great experience in many Departments, that he transfers Works to the Ministry of 1533 Housing and Local Government and that he reduces it to its old position with a First Commissioner for Works.\n\n§ Mr. A. C. M. Spearman (Scarborough and Whitby)\n\nI listened with enjoyment and interest to considerable portions of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan). I always enjoy listening to the right hon. Gentleman, but I thought that a considerable part of his speech today has been made in self-defence. His speech was eloquent, because he has a power of words which few possess, but I feel I must sympathise with him, as his effort was largely wasted, because the leader of his own party did not happen to be in the Chamber.\n\nNeither the right hon. Gentleman nor any other Member speaking on that side of the House chose to recognise the great change in the position during the last few months. In March, we were losing our reserves at an enormous rate, and, if that had continued, we should hardly have had any reserves left. If any hon. Member opposite doubts whether that matters, I would remind him of what the late Sir Stafford Cripps said, and let me here assure hon. Members opposite that 1537 Sir Stafford Cripps was held in great respect by many people on this side of the House. Sir Stafford Cripps said: All that stands between us and disaster is our gold reserve. If we allow this to be completely exhausted, we shall not be able to buy enough food to live on, enough raw material to keep our production going. But we must recognise that the position is still very unstable indeed. Our reserves today are less than they have ever been, except for the few weeks before devaluation, and they are only the equivalent of eight weeks' imports.\n\nOn E.P.U., we have a huge overdraft at the present time. The Chancellor told us yesterday that our exports during the second quarter of this year were considerably down in volume. I fear that there will be a great falling off in the orders for exports. We must always remember that we not only have to make goods for export, but we also have to sell them, and we now have to sell them against competitors who were not competing against us before. We have to recognise that, with reserves at this level, we are very dependent indeed upon opinion overseas. That is a very unhappy position for us to be in, but I do not think we improve it by shutting our eyes to it.\n\nThere has been a great deal of play on what the Prime Minister said in regard to the economic position. Those people who can sell sterling at the present time or who can delay paying their debts are not people who are ignorant of economic forces and unduly sensitive to optimistic or pessimistic speeches. They probably know just about as much as most of us about the present situation, and they are really not so interested in what we say as in what we do. On the whole, I should say that they are more encouraged by a frank recognition of the difficulties we are in than they are by optimistic speeches.\n\nThe Chancellor has said that he must make further cuts in imports, and I believe that may be necessary, but we have to remember that that can help only in the very short run. If we import less, and if we do not produce more at home and if we do not curtail demand, then it is quite clear that prices must rise heavily through the ordinary laws of supply and demand. Not only will prices rise heavily, but activity will be diverted away from the export industries to supplies for the home demand.\n\n1538 I believe the real cause of this persistent trouble with the balance of payments position is that for years we have been living beyond our means. I carefully choose the words \"beyond our means\" because I do not think that we have been living beyond what we are capable of producing, but living beyond what we actually have produced. During the six years of Socialist Government, for two years we had a credit balance of £250 million in our balance of payments, and for four years an adverse balance of £1,400 million. We were then living beyond our means and financing the deficit by huge gifts and loans from the United States, by running into debt with our Colonies up to the extent of £1,000 million and by running down our reserves.\n\nThese resources are not now available; what, then, can we do? I think that all hon. Members on this side of the House would agree that we can do nothing by further taxation. I think that would be endorsed very largely throughout the country. I am quite sure that we cannot cut re-armament below what is considered vital for defence, because if there is one thing that everyone in the country is agreed upon it is that even unemployment, even hunger, is better than another war. We must not starve industrial development, because there is no possible way of holding our own in this country unless we can produce the goods at competitive prices with other countries.\n\nTherefore, I believe that we have just got to cut Government expenditure drastically. I have never been one of those who thought that we could do that effectively just by cutting out waste. I am sure there is a lot of waste in Government Departments, but I have always thought the honest approach to it was that to make really drastic cuts meant a change of policy; meant stopping doing things, even though they were highly desirable because at that particular moment we could not afford them.\n\nI do not believe that we can afford to pay between £80 million and £90 million to subsidise house-building at the present time. A very distinguished Member of this House once said of the speech of another Member that some of what he said was true and some was trite; that what was true was trite and what was not trite was not true. If I said that the tremendous need to supply our people with more houses was agreed by every- 1539 one, I think I should be saying what was not only true but was trite, in the sense that it was obvious. It is particularly obvious to all of us who go to our constituencies and find the suffering, ill-health and family trouble that come from inadequate housing conditions. If I said that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government, by his vigour and his efficiency, had built far more houses than the previous Government with an economy of the use of materials. I think that is equally obvious and equally true.\n\n§ Mr. Davies\n\nIt should not be very difficult to estimate. It must have been present to the minds of the Government, otherwise they would not have made this change. What the exact amount will be, and whether their estimate will be proved right by the course of events, one does not know, but at least they must have had some information which they ought to have been able to give to the House. So what our position is, and what it is going to be, in regard to this very serious matter, I do not know.\n\nThe Prime Minister very rightly goes on emphasising the need we are in because of our lack of raw materials and food Time and again he has pointed out what others of us have time and again pointed out: that food for three out of every five persons has to be purchased, and it can be purchased only by increasing the quantity and sale of our exports. We should like to know what information the Government have had which would make them feel a little happier and industry in this country feel a little safer as a result of the new change of policy. 1544 So far we have not had one word on that from the President of the Board of Trade.\n\nAll that we get from everyone in turn is what we have heard in this House in every economic debate, quite rightly, that cuts in imports may have to be made, because they are rather like an operation which has to be conducted in order to save the life of the patient. These cuts have undoubtedly staunched the rapid flow of the blood of our reserves which has been flowing out of this country ever since last July. That cannot be the true remedy. Everyone says that the right remedy is to have more production. We cannot have more production if we are going to make cuts in our imports. The one and only way would be to extend our imports, if we possibly can.\n\nThere is another matter which has been mentioned time and again in relation to getting more production, and that is the removal of restrictions. Very little has been said about it in this debate, but I wish to refer to the continuance, without a doubt, of restrictions in trade associations and trade unions, which were brought in by such organisations at a time when they were, without doubt, passing through a very serious and difficult period but which ought not to have any place today in our economic system. If they cannot be removed, then it is time that the Government took some action about them.\n\nIt is very rightly suggested—it is apparently agreed on all sides—that all of us without exception should work harder, and it is apparently also agreed that there has to be a cut in expenditure. Very well. Such steps will lead to the greater preparation of goods for export if the goods can only be sold, but undoubtedly our difficulties in selling are on the increase. There is no longer a sellers' market.\n\nWhat is more, competition is getting keener. The backlog which grew up during the war when people had to go without has now been filled up to a very large extent, and there are also new competitors in the market. Germany and Japan are now coming in, and quite rightly so, for those people are entitled just as much as we are to produce as much as they can. We have to meet 1545 that new competition, but there is even greater competition to meet, and that is the competition coming from the overspill from the United States of America. That is far bigger than anything we have ever been able to do or are ever likely to be able to do.\n\nThat brings me to the main point of what I want to say tonight. Certainly since 1945 we have had crisis after crisis, and, as I have already said, the crisis always seems to come up in July. I have seen the Leader of the Opposition and his Chancellors of the Exchequer come to the Despatch Box July after July saying, \"Again we are in trouble. Again there has to be a cut in expenditure at home\"—which was never fully carried out—\"and there must be a cut in imports.\" That is not going to solve the situation.\n\nI cannot quite understand what the position is today. As I once pointed out to this House, we did not learn a lesson from the attack made upon our liberties by the Kaiser and his myrmidons. The most that we did was to form the League of Nations. We do not really seem to have learnt our full lesson from Hitler. But we are learning our lesson today from the attack that is being made from Moscow. There is a realisation throughout the world that freedom is threatened in every free country.\n\nThe result is that every free country—even the United States of America—has said, \"We are not strong enough to stand alone.\" We have therefore come to pooling our armies, and we have made arrangements to that end. We are to have one general staff and we are to have one generalissimo, at present General Ridgway. There will also be a pooling of the navies and the air forces. That is all to the good.\n\nThere was one thing in the Prime Minister's speech that I did not understand. In dealing with this very matter, he said that it was not right that those who were agreed with us in pooling resources for defence should be consulting with one another before any change was made. I should have thought that it was absolutely necessary that we should be completely frank with one another and say exactly what we could do and then carry out that agreement, unless some change made it impossible, and that before any such 1546 change was carried out we should consult our Allies and say, \"We cannot do this; it may throw a further burden upon you.\" There ought to be that consultation. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale was right about it.\n\nSo far, so good; but that is not all. There does not seem to have been any agreement whatsoever about a common foreign policy. That is bad enough, but what is much worse is that there is no agreement whatsoever about a common economic policy to uphold the common armaments. Therein has lain the danger throughout. We saw it immediately after Korea. We saw how each one went rushing about to grab as much raw materials and machinery as he possibly could in order to build himself safe but leaving his allies with less. Up went all the prices, making the economic position of every country in the world difficult.\n\nSurely we all realise now that we cannot have social security unless we also have military security and we cannot have military security unless it is based upon economic soundness, and at the moment every one of the free countries is in economic difficulties. Even America is not as well off or its position is not as strong economically as it was a little while ago.\n\nThe Prime Minister announced yesterday that we are now to have a new conference of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers. That is excellent in its way, but why limit it to them? The great potential Power is the United States of America. Why do we not ask for a full conference of the free nations who have joined together in saying, \"We must defend freedom,\" or the conference might be limited to those who have joined together and said, \"We must defend freedom in Korea.\"\n\n§ Mr. I. J. Pitman (Bath)\n\nI wish to raise three points, and the first is the question of the sterling balances and the vast load of debt under which this country has been left staggering as a result of the contribu- 1549 tion which we made to saving the freedom of the world. It will be remembered by hon. Members in all parts of the House that at the time of the American Loan there was an understanding that those debts should be scaled down. But it was not done. Now, it was a mistake to leave the onus on us to call such a conference to scale down our debts. Accordingly, one of the first jobs of our present Government ought to be to ask the Americans, when their new President takes office, to take the lead in this respect, and call a conference with a view to removing these appalling shackles upon our recovery. I would regard that as a major factor in the maintenance of the value of the £.\n\nThe next point I want to make is that foreign exchange control is, in practice, lowering the value of our £. Both those who disagree with me and those who agree with me will accept the assurance that we are all desirous that the value of the £ should remain and be maintained as high as possible. Where we differ is that whereas some people think that exchange control keeps up the £'s value, there are others, of whom I am one, who think it is dragging the value of the £ down. We all know only too well that at a time when our dollar balance is against us, any fall in the value of the £ must aggravate our plight and be disastrous, and it would be idiotic for me or anybody to suggest any proposal which would lead to a diminution in the value of the £. My point then is that foreign exchange control is not working, is not maintaining the £ as was intended but is slowly and silently undermining it.\n\nI have refreshed my memory on what I said in this House when the Foreign Exchange Control Act was under discussion. We in the Conservative Party approached the subject on the basis that foreign exchange should not be permanent, and secondly, we doubted whether it was going to work. The intervening years have shown clearly that foreign exchange control does not work in practice and acts as a one way valve. People from outside do not send their balances, which would help save the £, into the sterling area, because they know quite well that once they have placed their good money in the net they cannot ever take it out again. Similarly, since foreign exchange control has to operate on a subjective basis, it is fairly obvious 1550 that it is not stopping and can never wholly stop the leakage out of all that which seeks to find its way out of the sterling area. There is thus a steady leakage with no balancing income.\n\nWe have only to look at the answer to a Question which I put to Sir Stafford Cripps when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer to confirm that foreign exchange control cannot protect the £ as it was hoped that it might. His answer shows that the vast leakages at that time were not due to any fault in foreign exchange control, but were due to forces over which foreign exchange control had no powers, forces which were and are inherent in the situation.\n\nIt seems to me that foreign exchange control is moreover like a Leyden jar or a condenser. The value of the £ is slowly but constantly going down in reality, but that valve being artificially maintained by foreign exchange control until it reaches breaking point, there is inevitably in time a heavy shock and the goes down to a lower level in one big jump to a level even lower than it would otherwise have gone.\n\nNo one in man's history has yet been able to demonstrate that foreign exchange control itself supports the currency it is designed to support, but, on the contrary, we have only to ask those who are experienced in this field to be told that it has failed and that it is acting in the way the very opposite to that of its underlying purpose and is dragging down the £.\n\nMy third point is that I would urge the Government, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn, West (Mr. Assheton), to adopt a more correct and therefore better nomenclature about the \"balance of payments difficulties\" or \"crises,\" \"the dollar and gold shortage\" and the \"dollar gap.\" Such purely financial terms clearly disguise the reality and divert attention from the true facts, which are that this is a problem of a deficiency in national production.\n\nThere has been a tendency, in support of Socialist planning, to seek to denigrate finance and to talk as if difficulties of this kind were financial. This tendency is to be deprecated because it diverts attention from the fundamental point, which is that it is not finance which is dictating and causing the real situation but the real situation dictating to finance. Finance inevitably follows pro- 1551 duction and consumption which are the realities. Finance is thus only of secondary importance. Therefore, I urge the Chancellor to talk about our production deficiencies and not to talk about our balance of payments difficulties.\n\nI think that all this arises from a wrong attitude in this nation towards production. I have a friend just down from Oxford on his long vacation. He wants to obtain industrial experience. He goes into a factory and he is not allowed to do any productive work at all. He is not allowed to produce anything. He can stand and ask questions, but if it comes to production the whole place goes out on strike.\n\n§ Sir John Barlow (Middleton and Prestwich)\n\nI do not propose to follow the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. D. Griffiths) because he has spoken about a subject, coalmining, about which I know little or nothing. We have this in common, that we are both most anxious to see increased production in this country.\n\nYesterday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer laid great emphasis on the expansion of exports and the diminution of imports. One of the contributions to the reduction of imports undoubtedly can be increased agricultural production in this country. I do not propose to spend any appreciable time on this subject, but we all know that since the war the increase in the production of food in this country has been most disappointing. I believe that the present output is only about 7½ per cent. above that in the war and, when one considers the advances which have been made both technically and mechanically, and the labour available since the war, it is amazing that the increase has not been greater than about 7½ per cent. I urge the Government most strongly to follow that up because it can be a tremendous indirect producer of dollars.\n\nI wish to speak more particularly about the textile industry, for two reasons. One is because I represent a division which is vitally interested in textiles, but I should not dare to do it for that reason alone. The other reason is because textiles are of such vital interest 1563 to Lancashire as a whole and to the possible exports of this country. Before the First World War about 75 per cent. of the production of cotton textiles went for export and 25 per cent. for home use. In 1938, just before the last war, it was about 50–50. Recently, it has been about 75 per cent. for home use and 25 per cent. for export. That is a very serious change round for a country such as ours, dependent so largely on exports in order to buy food and raw materials.\n\nI emphasise that this is not a party question but a national question. It only hit the country vitally in the last few months. The first signs of a recession or a slump came last August—I am making no party point on that: it was bound to come at some time. One of the difficulties of the textile trade has been the tremendous changes in the last 12 years. It will be remembered that at the beginning of the war it was vital to increase exports as much as possible in order to pay for munitions of war. Suddenly, overnight, we had enormous financial help from America which immediately changed the position. After the war there was a sellers' market and practically anything that was made could be sold at a large profit, perhaps at too large a profit. Now, again, almost overnight, we are suddenly faced with a lack of orders which is most serious for Lancashire and for the country as a whole.\n\nIt is possible that because of these very rapid changes some manufacturers or merchants may have got out of touch with the particular requirements of their markets. The noble Lady the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) drew attention to that when she spoke about the wrong kind of advertising in Canada and other places. Not only are all the difficulties of production and price with which we were familiar in prewar days very much alive today, but there are many other questions over which the merchant or manufacturer has no control whatever. I refer, in particular, to exchange controls, to G.A.T.T. to quotas, subsidies of various sorts, bulk purchase and penal taxation. These are all matters which have arisen since the war over which the export merchant has no control.\n\nIt is suggested that we are going through a temporary slump and that orders will 1564 be coming forward normally in the autumn. I wish I could think that that were true. It may be true, but I doubt it. In any case, it is only prudent to take the pessimistic view and do everything we can to secure orders whether they ate coming along naturally or not. I should like to see the Government take a more active part in helping merchants to get orders from abroad. Owing to the difficulties, some of which I am trying to point out, I think that the Government could and should help more than they did in pre-war days.\n\nI should like to see a small commission appointed to consider the various foreign markets because though orders are difficult to get we know perfectly well that by help in some directions, may be price or may be by some sort of outside bargains, we can get more business. The state of the industry is so desperate that we must leave no stone unturned. We must do everything we can to get more business. I should like to see such a commission appointed, to work very quickly and to consider the different markets of the world.\n\nWe know that some South American markets, the Argentine, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile, all want textiles, but for certain reasons they cannot or do not take them. It may be possible, with closer Government co-operation and help, for us in some way to get our goods into those markets. Have inquiries been made? Do we know that it is impossible under all the circumstances? That may be known to the Government, but that knowledge is not known to us.\n\nThere are many other markets, and colonial markets in particular, which were comparatively small before the war but which are infinitely more important now. Colonial merchants, naturally, try to sell their produce in the best market and buy in the cheapest market. That is all very well up to a point, but we give very valuable help to the Colonies and make certain concessions to them. They want our help and capital for development, and we are anxious to do the right thing by them. In the same way, I think we have a right to assume that they will take a reasonable amount of their textile requirements from this country. That cannot be settled by merchants in London and Manchester, 1565 but only at a high level, by the Government. Are these things being investigated, because I am sure that is worth while?\n\nTo give another instance, Pakistan has more cotton than she can consume and in the past she has been subsidising her cotton textiles. Can we buy her cotton, which will be useful to Lancashire, at a reasonable price, and in return get some concession for our textiles? That is a suggestion in the trade that might be a possibility. That sort of thing should be investigated. I feel sure that some good would come somewhere.\n\nIt may well be that in the case of the more hopeful markets it would be advisable to send missions to investigate the matter on the spot. If and when that is done, I should like to see those missions composed of workpeople or trade unionists and other people interested in the cotton textile trade. But they must contain one man who is familiar with the market, probably a merchant who has been selling goods to that market; otherwise they will not really get to the bottom of the matter.\n\nI have promised to be brief, but I hope the House will have seen, from some of the questions I have put, that I have a feeling that owing to the sudden change from a sellers' market to a buyers' market, perhaps we—the Government and the merchants—have lost the grip on the situation which we used to have. I feel that in some ways we are drifting, and it is of vital importance that we should again get a grip of the matter.\n\nIf we wait and do nothing business will probably return in time, but we want it quickly. I would say, in conclusion, that world conditions are partially responsible for our difficulties in the textile trade, but I believe that those difficulties are capable of solution if the Government tackle them with the urgency which the situation demands. We have in Lancashire a greater accumulated knowledge and experience of textiles than any other nation; we have some of the finest textile workers in the world, and a vast amount of machinery and equipment.\n\nThese are great national assets which we cannot afford to fritter away. The industry is ready and indeed anxious to fight for its existence, but owing to the complication of world conditions it must have the energetic help and guidance of the Government. I believe that only 1566 along those lines can Lancashire find a solution to her difficulties and continue to provide her share of exports, which are so vital today.\n\n§ Mr. Ellis Smith (Stoke-on-Trent, South)\n\nI welcome the opportunity of speaking in favour of the Amendment, but I wish it had contained more constructive proposals. I propose to make some critical observations that need to be made in this House and which ought to have been made before now, and then make some constructive proposals on the lines on which I have been speaking for about six years.\n\nI welcome the increasing realisation in this country that we are now on the edge of an economic abyss. Because I am so pleased to belong to the class from which I come, knowing that it is they who in the main have made our country great, and that so much is at stake in that respect, I wish to make constructive proposals, and I hope that they will be carried into effect before I make my final contribution.\n\nWe are faced in this country with three wide gaps. The first is in our balance of payments; the second is in our output and productivity compared with the United States; and the third is between the rich and the ordinary people in this country. These wide gaps are due, first, to generations of neglect in the past and to 10 years of world war, a fact which is not appreciated by some other people in some parts of the world. It used to be said that the House of Commons is the graveyard of courage; if we are to deal with the problems which now face our fellow countrymen, that will not have to be said with truth in the future.\n\nI believe that we all ought to be big enough to admit that my right hon. Friends the Members for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) and Huyton (Mr. H. Wilson) and my hon. and real Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Mr. Edward Davies) and Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Dr. Stross) have been proved right in respect of the problems which we are considering.\n\nA lesson dearly bought should be a lesson well taught. We should have told the United States that we could not afford the economic strain of gigantic armaments. We should have reminded the United States that we lost 700,000 men 1567 before they came into the First World War. We should have reminded them that we strained ourselves and stood alone for 12 months before they came into the Second World War. We should have reminded them that we sold our assets to buy arms and that they made large profits as a result. We should have told the United States that we paid large compensation for British shares sold in the United States so that we could buy the arms urgently required to enable our men to hold their own during the 12 months when we stood alone. Well might Mr. Stettinius say that the United States bought time with British blood.\n\nWe should have reminded the United States of how they treated that great public-spirited man Lord Keynes, when he was negotiating on behalf of our country. We should have reminded them how soon they cut off lend-lease when the people of this country voted in the way they did after the termination of hostilities. The recent policy of the United States of ruthlessly grabbing scarce materials upset the economic equilibrium of the Western countries and resulted in the rocketing up of prices, which has had a serious effect upon our balance of payments, and upon the export trade, in which some of us have been brought up and about which we know what has gone on for so long.\n\nIn my view, we are trying to do too much with limited resources, and we shall pay a terrible price for the refusal of Conservatives in all walks of life and in all kinds of organisations to plan this country. We urgently need increased production, yet we cut down our capital expenditure on production equipment. Last week I put down two Questions in order to obtain replies to what I am about to mention, but up to now I have not received the replies.\n\nIf my analysis of Command Papers 8203 and 8486 is right, we are not only cutting down on capital expenditure, but also we are not meeting our current depreciation. If my analysis of the figures is correct, those responsible should be charged with criminality and with the ruining of this country in the way that they are.\n\nIn the United States they have three times our population, but ten times our national income, and that is increasing 1568 each year. I could quote the figures if I had more time. I want to plead that it is time that we in this country adopted a constructive economic policy which we could all support. I am pleading for a wealth production policy and a programme of action on condition—and let me emphasise this with all the strength I can—that there is a fair distribution of the fruits of industry; and that any increase in output is used in the national interest and not to benefit any small group of people.\n\nWe should fix targets and increase output for certain periods to be decided on by industry, so serious is the situation in which we find ourselves. Our people need increased horsepower per head in industry; modern productivity equipment; more manpower in productive industry. There are far too many in this country watching too few do the real production work. We need the modernisation of our organisation, less expenditure on nonessentials and more on world production equipment. We need double-shift working where required. We need incentives and priorities for those engaged in productive industry.\n\nWe realise the need for and will readily agree to a critical examination, provided action is taken, of all restrictions in our country, no matter who may be responsible for them. But in my view the most urgent need is for action to be taken against the trade associations which have obtained such a terrible grip upon the raw materials required in the productive industry of this country.\n\nWe also need a real shake-up in the Ministry of Education. It is well known among engineering students, whether they be management or workpeople, that we urgently need technological centres at Manchester, Glasgow and Newcastle especially.\n\n§ Mr. Ellis Smith\n\nI readily agree with my hon. Friend, and I do not blame him for making that point. If all hon. Members watched their constituency interests in the same way as he does, no one would be more pleased than I should be.\n\nAll overhead charges in industry need urgent examination. During the past 30 years overhead charges on productive industry have grown to a mountainous 1569 height. Productive industry in this country is carrying overheads, of a parasitical nature to a greater extent than any industry in any part of the world. In addition, we cannot afford the overheads caused by our over-heavy military commitments, and we also need the men in productive industry. I have so much confidence in my fellow countrymen that I believe there would be a great response to a programme and a policy of this kind, and that we should get the great drive which we require.\n\nCoal is now modern gold, and yet in some cases we are burning it unnecessarily and in others we could be burning inferior coal and exporting the better coal to enable us to improve our economic position. We urgently require a national fuel and power policy and the scientific utilisation of this modern gold. I give all credit to hon. Members on both sides of the House who a few weeks ago made their contributions to this subject. When will the Minister act? When will he be shaken out of his complacency? During the war this country was dynamic. Democracy was dynamic, and Ministers responded to it. The present serious situation demands the same kind of dynamic drive from Ministers.\n\nThe Chancellor gave credit to the coal industry, but he also might have given credit to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition who enjoys the enormous good will of the miners. When my right hon. Friend sent out that letter—which too many have forgotten—the response he received was due to the loyalty of the miners. They worked Saturday mornings and over-time, and have done so up to the present time.\n\nWe need an increased output of steel by the concentration and modernisation of our steel plant. Instead of an increased output of steel, the Government are now taking steps to discourage the men employed in the steel industry. Nationalisation receives our support not merely as a political issue, but because we need it for technical reasons if we are to keep pace with the output throughout the world, and especially in the United States. Millions and millions of pounds need to be spent on capital equipment to enable the steel workers to do justice to themselves. All our resources should be concentrated on securing the maximum output of those products which will serve 1570 the national interest best, with minimum delivery dates.\n\nWhen I heard the Prime Minister and the Chancellor say that we are to export arms, a shudder went down my back. This means that a section of the engineering industry will be risking their future markets and letting them go to some other country which will deal with us ruthlessly when the time arrives. Then, again, there will be talk about reducing our standard of living because of the neglect and the policy pursued now.\n\nIn addition, we need a drive for maximum efficiency and output in agriculture. There must be better use of our land. We need a land reclamation drive. It is admitted by all students of economic affairs that civil engineering has done a good job for opencast mining. We now need civil engineering on the job of reclaiming our land along the shores at places like Southport, and along the Wash. There are miles of derelict land alongside the railways running through Stoke-on-Trent, Wigan, Glasgow and other places, which could be utilised to increase our food supply. What the people of Holland and Israel can do, our people can do if they can have a Government which will provide them with the necessary tools. I plead for this type of policy to be applied.\n\nI welcome the proposed Commonwealth Conference to be held in London in November. I hope that we shall go there with concrete proposals. I hope that we shall be in a position to make proposals which will enable a plan to be prepared so that we can work with those countries which have proved to be such great friends of ours, namely, Australia, New Zealand, Canada. Australia can enormously increase its food production if only it can be mechanised on the same level as we have mechanised our own farming.\n\nAlso, we ought to be taking the initiative in asking the United Nations to call a world economic conference so that not only can we plan for the Commonwealth but the whole world can be called upon to save mankind by dealing with mankind's urgent economic problems instead of quibbling among ourselves and snarling at one another as so many are constantly doing.\n\nI started my speech by being critical of the United States in the belief that I 1571 speak for millions of my fellow countrymen. We do not want another war. If we are to avoid another war it is now that we must fight war so as to prevent it. We have to ask mankind throughout the world to prepare plans to deal with our economic problems rather than to prepare plans to slaughter mankind, as we have done twice in my lifetime.\n\nThe people of our country have nothing against other people. Whether their skins be black, white or yellow, our people think well of them. They want to take them by the hand and become their friends. They want to work with them. They want to trade with them. They want to live in one world together. I believe that millions of Americans have the same wish. It is time that our country took the initiative in adopting a policy to save ourselves and to make a greater contribution towards saving mankind at the same time.\n\n§ Mr. Amery\n\nOf a different kind. I do not propose to discuss the situation in 1945.\n\nI do not think that hon. Gentlemen opposite would grudge me my claim. I would also say that all of us ought to pay a special tribute to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for his achievement in halting the drain on our reserves. He has staved off the collapse—the break-up—of the sterling area which threatened us in the early part of the year. He has averted a catastrophe.\n\nFor all that, our position remains extremely precarious. Our reserves have shrunken to danger point. It may be, 1572 if all goes well, that the Chancellor's optimism will be justified, but any serious worsening in the economic weather might easily sink us altogether. But for American aid and some drawing on stocks in the early part of the year it is difficult to see how we could have avoided a devaluation in the last few months. We may not avoid it even now.\n\nWhat has been the policy of the Government for solving our payments crisis? It has been, on the one hand, to reduce consumption by cutting imports and raising the interest rate and, on the other, to encourage exports to the non-sterling area and the dollar world. Now the Chancellor has called for a further increase in those exports. How is it to be done? As consumer goods already face a shrinking market, the burden, as he said, will fall, on the engineering and metal using industries. They are to be helped by a change in the pattern of the re-armament programme. What does this amount to? We are really being asked to continue what I might call the Cripps-Gaitskell policy in another form. It is \"the mixture as before\" with a flavour of deflation and a dose of Bevanism thrown in.\n\nIs there any prospect, even with these new ingredients, that such a policy will enable us to attain, and what is still harder, to maintain the necessary increase in our exports? We were told at the end of the war that we had to increase exports by 75 per cent. over the pre-war volume. Despite a sellers' market and American aid that target has never been effectively maintained.\n\nCan we hope now for any further substantial increase in exports, now when we are confronted with a buyers' market, with reviving German and Japanese competition, not to speak of the heavy new burdens which we shall have to shoulder next year in Germany for the maintenance of our defence Forces over there? It is hard enough to believe that we could come in sight of the new export targets even in good times: with a recession in the United States it would be out of the question.\n\nThe Government have a short-term policy. It seems to be doubtful whether it will work. It is perfectly clear that they have not yet got a long-term policy of any kind. There is a danger, moreover, that, by over-emphasising the im- 1573 portance of dollar exports in the interest of maintaining the present import programme, they may sacrifice our only hope of getting back to an expanding economy.\n\nI must confess that I was somewhat alarmed yesterday to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer blaming the greater part of our difficulties on the last war. Of course, they were aggravated by the last war, but if we believe that they are only due to that war we still do not know what has hit us. Our difficulties result from a deep-rooted and continuing crisis which has been with us for close on half a century. It is a crisis caused by our failure to adapt ourselves to the changes which have transformed our trading position in the world.\n\nIn the old days—the days of Cobden and Bright—food and raw materials were cheap. That is why Cobden, with his friends, went all out for a policy of free imports. The wanted cheap raw materials in order to make cheap production possible. They wanted cheap food in order to be able to pay low wages. In those days, industry carried very small overheads. When the grandfather of the present hon. Member for Cheltenham, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, raised the Income Tax to 1s. 2d. in the £, the \"Daily Mail\" came out with a headline \"Is it the end of us?\" There was no Welfare State then; as for re-armament, we just thanked God that there was a British Navy, and left it at that.\n\nThose days have gone, and they are not coming back. Food and raw materials are dear, and they are likely to stay dear and may become even dearer. Nor is there any substantial hope of a reduction in our overheads for many years to come. We are - all, in both parties, determined to keep up the main structure of the Welfare State, and it is quite clear, in the world as we know it, that we have to devote a substantial part of our income to defence. These things are the political realities of the times. But the cost of them, if you add it up, means that we can never again be the cheapest producers in the world.\n\nThis fundamental change in our position has been aggravated by the dollar problem. The refusal of the Americans to import or invest as much as they export has brought about a complete and lasting breakdown in the 1574 machinery of world payments. We can no longer hope to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest. We have to buy in markets in which our currency will be accepted, and we have to sell to purchasers who have currency with which to pay us.\n\nEver since the war, we have been indulging in a romantic illusion—I mean the American attempt to recreate a system of multilateral world trade such as existed, not before the last war, but before the First World War. There is nothing more tragic in life than the murder of a beautiful theory by a gang of brutal facts. Twentieth century America is not and cannot be 19th century Britain. She does not need the imports, as we did; she has unparalleled opportunities for investment within her own boundaries or next door. Nor will she follow our example and ruin her agriculture in the interests of an economic theory.\n\nIn these conditions, the Bretton Woods Agreement, the Washington Loan Agreement, the Geneva Convention, the Havana Charter and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have all been milestones on the road not to recovery, but to disaster. We may as well recognise that the day of the Manchester school of economic theory, glorious as it may have been, has gone. Hon. Members will remember the old saying, \"What Lancashire says today, England will say tomorrow.\" As a representative of Lancashire in this House, I hope that that may come true again, but the first step towards making it come true is to make up our minds that what Manchester said yesterday England must never say again.\n\nThe alternative, as I see it, to a return to a multilateral system which the Americans have been urging upon us, is to make ourselves a great producing country and, as far as we can, a great producing Commonwealth; not self-sufficient, but more self reliant and better balanced both in regard to industrial and primary products than we are today.\n\nWhat does this policy imply? We must cut our dollar imports to the level of our dollar earnings. We must maintain a high level of export. These are already agreed aims between us. But, important as they are, there is one thing which is more important. That is to 1575 develop new supplies of food and raw materials, first and foremost in this country, and then throughout the sterling commonwealth. This should be our first aim, and we should seek our future economic expansion, not in what the economists call the neutral markets of the world, but in the new markets created by our own development policy for ourselves.\n\nThe opportunities for such development are very great. Here, at home, I believe we could produce 25 per cent. more food than we do now. I thought it discouraging to see from the Economic Survey that capital investment in agriculture last year was only 4.5 per cent. of the whole, and even this figure has been cut by 15 per cent. of that amount this year. We are all encouraged to know that coal production is improving, and we hope it will continue, and I agree with the Chancellor that much could be done to increase the production of building materials here in this country.\n\nBeyond this, there is the whole range of synthetic products. Should we really go on paying dollars for cotton from which to make shirts to sell in this country and in the sterling area but on which we never get back a single dollar? Ought we not rather to be encouraging the Lancashire mills to change over, not entirely, but as much as they can, to rayon or synthetic fibres which have a much lower dollar content?\n\nThere are even greater opportunities for development in the Commonwealth. There is very little that we need which cannot be produced in some quantities in the Commonwealth. In a comparatively short time, the Commonwealth countries could supply all our needs in copper, sugar, and tobacco, which are among the main items on our dollar import list today.\n\nUnconsciously, and in a typically British way, we have been moving towards the creation of a sterling trading area, under the impact of the war and also of the post-war difficulties. Our trade with the Commonwealth was formerly about 30 per cent. of our total trade. It now stands at nearly 50 per cent. Some of this has taken place through the Colonial Development Corporation. Some has been the result of Socialist policy.\n\n1576 However mistaken that policy was at home, it had at least one result. It literally drove capital and skill, through excessive taxation, to seek refuge in the Commonwealth. Every cloud has its silver lining. A good deal has actually been done in the last seven years. The trouble is that it has not been done as a deliberate policy of Commonwealth expansion, but as a makeshift policy intermittently imposed upon us by balance of payments difficulties. As a result, the investors have had no confidence that it would continue.\n\nLast summer, in Southern Rhodesia, I asked a tobacco farmer why he did not increase his production. I said that he would help us with our dollar problem. He replied, \"No doubt, you will buy my crop while balance of payments difficulties remain, but what assurance have I that you will not go back to dollar tobacco the moment that you are in balance with the dollar countries?\"\n\nTo develop new supplies of food and raw materials in the sterling area will call for relatively heavy investment. It is essential, therefore, to create the conditions which will attract that investment. Capital is naturally timid; it will not come forward unless there is an assurance that what it produces will find a market. To create this confidence, we shall have to discriminate in favour of the Commonwealth producer as a matter of deliberate, declared and permanent policy.\n\nThere are many ways in which this can be done. We, on this side of the House, have always been in favour of tariff preferences, which we regard as the most liberal, the most free trade way of regulating trade. Hon. Members opposite may prefer quotas or bulk purchase measures. There is no doubt that some of the primary producers in the Commonwealth have a deep-rooted preference for long-term contracts. But whether we go for preference or for quotas or for long-term contracts, we must first denounce those sections of the G.A.T.T. Agreement which limit our right to discriminate in favour of our partners in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Japanese have now applied to join G.A.T.T. If Japan is to become a normal and healthy member of the free world, I really do not see how we can 1577 refuse to let them in. On the other hand, if we do let them in, we commit ourselves to giving most favoured nation treatment to Japan, and we jettison our last hope of protecting the colonial market. It may be that this new danger will prove to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nIt may be that it will finally convince the Government that they must now denounce those sections of G.A.T.T. which seek to extend the most-favoured-nation clause to inter-Commonwealth trade. We on this side of the House were pledged at the Election to denounce those sections of G.A.T.T. Many of us have waited very patiently while Ministers are trying to make up their minds on this admittedly very difficult subject. I beg the Government not to mistake our patience for indifference, nor to underestimate the strength of feeling which exists on this question of G.A.T.T., at any rate on this side of the House.\n\nTrade measures must, of course, be backed by financial measures. A new investment programme for the sterling area will require new credit facilities. I wonder whether our present financial machinery is adequate for that task. How long can we continue holding the sterling area together with a bank which serves all its Governments and is controlled by only one of them? Has not the time come when steps should be taken to bring the management of sterling under joint Commonwealth control?\n\nSo much for the conditions which will attract investment from within the Commonwealth or from outside. What about the investment itself? Where are we to find the machinery, the capital equipment, which development requires? Others may help us in due course, but the main burden is bound to fall upon us. To shoulder it we shall have both to reduce consumption at home and to increase production.\n\nWhat room is there for cuts? There are to be changes in the defence programme. But these, we are told, are intended to facilitate exports rather than investment. I confess that I should be very loath to take any further steps in that direction. The dangers that confront us are still very grave. Our friendship with the United States and our influence in Western Europe depend more than anything else upon playing our full part in the North Atlantic Treaty Organi- 1578 sation. World confidence in sterling, moreover, depends, among other things, upon our ability to maintain ourselves as an imperial Power. Any further reduction in our present overseas commitments, any further Abadan, would damage our credit, perhaps irreparably. To that extent, any further cuts in the defence programme might easily prove to be false economy.\n\nOf course, cuts could no doubt be made in the social services, more particularly in the building programme. I know that there is a limit to what public opinion will endure; the British people have been through a lot in the last few years, and they will not stand for much more in the way of cuts or pin-pricks which lead nowhere; but that does not mean they have lost their sense of national discipline or self-control. On the contrary, if the British people are once convinced that a policy is right, if they are convinced that the Government believe in it and are resolved to carry it through, if they can be shown the light at the end of the tunnel, they will be ready to pay the price for recovery, whatever it may be.\n\nThere certainly is not much room left for cuts in general consumption, but something might still be done to guide resources and labour from less to more essential occupations. The Chancellor's disinflationary policy has had some success, although of a rather limited kind, in this direction. The trouble about this policy is that it is not sufficiently selective. I have often wondered whether we could not find a middle way between deflation and clumsy physical controls. Perhaps some form of differential interest rates might supply the answer.\n\nThere will have to be some cuts to achieve the necessary level of investments. But more important than cuts would be an increase in production. There are still several things that could be done in that direction. The elimination of restrictive practices, mentioned by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, is one of them; the working of more frequent shifts is another. Then there is the question of retirement. The Chancellor in the late Government urged the importance of postponing retirement. Certainly, an increase in the working life of the people of this country by two and a half to three years would make a very considerable contribution to increasing the national production.\n\n1579 No less important is the psychological factor. If the Government are to overcome the present crisis they must inspire all sections of the community with a sense of national and social purpose, with a vision of what they are working for—a vision of a free, expanding Commonwealth. They ought to try to make every employer and every worker in the country feel that he or she is a shareholder in a great concern; that he is saving money today so as to have more tomorrow.\n\n§ Mr. Amery\n\nI am urging the Government that they should move in that direction. If we produce, both in this country and in overseas countries, new supplies of food and raw materials which in a certain number of years will come back on to the markets here, we shall have the satisfaction which a shareholder gets when he gets a dividend. That was the point I was trying to make.\n\nWe have to go beyond self-interest, too. We must also make every man and woman in the country feel that they are doing something to consolidate Britain and the influence of the British Commonwealth as an independent factor in world politics. I am not one of those who believe that the task is beyond us. I believe we could solve this problem, if necessary, by ourselves alone. But, of course, it will be much easier if we can get others to come in and help us. The biggest source of capital investment today is the United States, and I will say a word about that in a moment. But there is another one on our doorstep, and it may prove even more important.\n\nWestern Europe—the great industrial complex of the Rhine Valley, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Ruhr, the Saar, Lorraine—has today idle factories and unemployed workers. These idle factories and unemployed workers are, in a certain sense, capital. It should not be beyond the wit of British statesmanship to devise means whereby they can be harnessed to the great development of the backward territories and more particularly of those in the sterling area.\n\nIt certainly would not be difficult to create the machinery. European currencies linked to sterling through a strength- 1580 ened E.P.U. would be one step. A European preferential area interlocking with our own might be another. All this would be in harmony with our often proclaimed policy of working in as closely as we can with Europe, short of federation. It would also be a guarantee against the not insignificant danger that the Schuman Plan countries might line up against us. Adding deficits together does not, of course, produce a surplus, but a combination of the resources of the sterling area with those of Europe should enable us in a comparatively short time to bring our trade with the dollar world into balance. Convertibility would then be in sight.\n\nBut the moment one speaks of an association between the Commonwealth and Europe, someone comes along and says, \"Oh, but you're ganging up against the United States.\" I yield to no one in my admiration of the great republic across the ocean. We all know that the cause of freedom depends upon an enduring partnership between us. But it must be a partnership between equals. We want to be America's allies, not her satellites, and we do a disservice to the cause of Anglo-American friendship if we hesitate to take the steps which would make us economically strong.\n\nThe United States, powerful and generous as they have been, and as they are, need a strong British Commonwealth, just as much as we need a strong United States. In the search for economic strength we have given more than a fair trial to their ideas of multilateral nondiscriminatory world free trade. The experiment has cost them billions of dollars in foreign aid. It has brought our reserves to danger point. The time has now come for a new deal, and I cannot believe the Americans would try to prevent it.\n\nOur partnership rests on much more solid foundations than the fads of economic theorists. We have got to build up a trading area of the sterling countries associated perhaps with Western Europe which will not be autarchic but sufficiently self-contained to enable us to face convertibility with the dollar. Once we get back to convertibility then, and only then, will the way be open for securing the American investment which the Commonwealth so badly needs. A return to that convertibility would be particularly helpful in our relations with Canada. Canada likes to buy from the United 1581 States and to sell to Britain. Nothing, therefore, could do more to promote cooperation between us than a return to convertibility.\n\nThe essential condition—and this is my last point in what I fear has been too long a speech—of any successful scheme of sterling area co-operation is to carry with us other sterling area Governments. We have to recognise that the primary producers are in a much stronger position today than they were at the time of the Ottawa Agreements. Preferences in the British market are attractive to them, but nothing like as attractive as they were back in 1932.\n\nOn the other hand, the sterling area countries are all vitally interested in securing a high level of investment and maintaining the strength of the sterling balances which they hold. How far will they co-operate with us in the policy I have sought to outline? We cannot generalise about the different countries of the Commonwealth. Some will move faster than others. We had an interesting indication, however, of Australian views when Mr. Menzies spoke in the Central Hall at Westminster recently.\n\nAs I understood that speech, its meaning was this. If Britain was prepared to take the lead in building up a strong sterling system, with all that this implies, Australia would co-operate to the full. If, on the other hand, Britain was undecided, then Australia would certainly do nothing which might involve her in any friction, however remote, with the United States. This view may well be shared by other Commonwealth Governments, and it points to the fact that responsibility for taking the lead rests here.\n\nIt is clear from the Chancellor's speech that the Government have not yet at any rate made up their minds which course they are going to take. Are they going to continue in the sterile paths of cutting consumption to push exports, a policy which seeks to 'redistribute a static limited volume of business? Or will they turn to the Empire and set out on a policy of economic development which will build up new markets for Britain and furnish her with new supplies of food and raw materials?\n\nThere is not much time left to make a decision. Before the year is up, Minis- 1582 ters are to meet the Governments of the Commonwealth, then the Governments of Western Europe and the new American Government. No good will come of these meetings unless we in Britain have a plan of our own to advocate. There must be a clear British point of view. In this, if we are to save ourselves as an independent unit in the world, Britain has not to follow but to lead.\n\n§ Mr. Roy Jenkins (Birmingham, Stechford)\n\nSome hon. Members opposite are very fond of pointing to differences within the Opposition, but having listened to most of the two days of this debate, I have been extremely impressed by differences not merely on immediate issues but of outlook and philosophy between hon. Members on the Government side. The hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. J. Amery) followed much the same line as the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Boothby) in his speech yesterday. Both of them believe that the world of the 19th Century is gone and finished, and something which we cannot put back.\n\nThe hon. Member for Preston, North is the biographer of Joseph Chamberlain, and in many respects he is true to the policy of the person about whom he wrote. He wants the sterling area, united with Western Europe, to move more and more into a self-contained position. If we contrast that with the speech of the right hon. Member for Blackburn, West (Mr. Assheton) yesterday, there is no point of agreement whatsoever. The right hon. Member for Blackburn, West believes that we have merely to cut 2s. off the Income Tax, get rid of Socialist inefficiency, and have a convertible pound and be back to the world of the 19th Century tomorrow.\n\nWe are not clear where the Chancellor of the Exchequer stands between these two schools of thought. He has not been kindly treated in this debate by either school of thought, and, although I am sorry to say it, because I have admired many of his speeches, he has not deserved very kind treatment. I think he has floated about rather uncertainly between the two schools of thought.\n\nWe all wish the Government well in the struggle against our economic difficulties, and we all recognise how intractable 1583 those difficulties are. But I think that, first of all, we must clear away a piece of self-righteousness with which the Government are surrounding themselves at the present time. More and more, Ministers are inclined to say that the fact that things have got a little better in the last six months is a great tribute to their measures and to themselves. They look at the fact that the drain on our gold reserves is not as heavy as it was some time ago. They look at the fact that our trading position is a little better in this half of the year, although I think that the Chancellor made his calculations there take into account dollar aid in a way not usually done in order to arrive at his favourable figures yesterday.\n\nMinisters are inclined to say, \"Look at all these improvements. How right it proves our monetary and fiscal policy to be, what a triumph it all is for the Budget.\" One cannot sustain that point of view at all. One is bound to say our recovery from the crisis of last autumn has been a good deal less sharp than our recovery from the crises either of 1947 or 1949.\n\nI am not going to argue that in all respects circumstances were similar, but I will say that at this point, after both those autumn crises, as regards both our basic trading position and as regards confidence in sterling, the position was much better than it is this year. Therefore, the Government certainly cannot say that it has been proved that its fiscal and monetary policy is right. This is no moment for the Government to be in any way arrogant in their approach to the problems. They can ask for good will but they cannot say, \"Look at the skill and the virtue that we have shown in clearing up the mess with which we were faced.\"\n\nI want to look back from the perspective of four months to the Chancellor's Budget. I must first admit that Budgets never look very good when regarded in perspective from the end of July, but this Budget looks particularly bad. It may be that in his overall estimate that consumption should be kept steady, neither decreasing nor being allowed to increase, the Chancellor was about right, but he has not been steadily giving effect to that policy. One sees this if one looks at the recent Exchequer returns.\n\n1584 The food subsidy cuts are not to come into effect to their full extent until the autumn, but the Income Tax concessions have already been given. Partly as a result of that and partly as a result of certain other factors, we see that during the first quarter of the financial year there has been the very big deficit of £355 million as opposed to one of £109 million in the same quarter last year and to a budgeted one of £80 million for the whole of this year. It may be that this deficit will be made up over the whole of the financial year, but that is not the complete answer to the position.\n\nIf it is necessary to have a Budget of a given degree of disinflation for the year as a whole, it is equally necessary to have that during the part of the year through which we are now passing. Perhaps it is more than ever necessary to have it in the summer months, which are very critical from a balance of payments point of view, and when in any case, owing to seasonal factors, unemployment is always lower than it is at any other time. What we are going to have this year is the disinflationary effect of the Budget, such as it is, coming along, not now but in the winter when unemployment may be going up in any case. If one needs to cut subsidies in the autumn, why should we not cut them in the summer months? What has happened makes nonsense of the whole policy.\n\nI am sure that at present the Chancellor of the Exchequer regrets his food subsidy cut almost as much as he regrets his Excess Profits Tax. It has brought him nothing but trouble. It has certainly had an absolutely disastrous effect on the wages situation. The Chancellor, in a speech at Exeter a few weeks ago, said that, provided that there were not too sharp wage increases, the general price level might be settling down at present. That may be so, but if so, it is a far more damning criticism of the Chancellor's food subsidy policy than has ever come from this side of the House.\n\nTo choose the moment when prices might otherwise have been settling down to cut the food subsidies was economic lunacy. At a time when prices were going up so fast that one would not notice another increase in the spiral, or at a time when prices were falling, there might have been sanity, if not justice, in cutting food subsidies, but to do it at the moment 1585 when things were showing a prospect of settling down and when we can afford a cost inflation from the point of view of our competitive position in export markets less than at any time in the last three years was nothing more nor less than economic lunacy.\n"
