        "text": "Monday, November 15, 2021\n\nFive musings from yesterday's walk into town...\n\nThis, I think, is the only road sign in the country to reference the A1, the A2, the A3 and the A4. It can be found on Whitechapel High Street heading west, just before you get to the inner ring road. It's probably significant that it's the last directional sign on the A11, a road which arrives from a direction very different to the other four. These A Roads are all at least a mile away (and if you go via the indicated route more like two), but all appear together on this single sign.\n\nI thought I'd risk tweeting a photo and stating that this was the only road sign in the country with all four, despite not knowing 100% if this was the case. Someone immediately called my bluff with a photo of a similar sign on the other side of the road, dammit, except their contradiction turned out to be an old sign removed years ago when the junction was rejigged. There was also debate about roads on the Isle of Man, but this generated nothing better than an A1/A2/A5 combo. So yes, I genuinely think this sign really is the only one to mention the first four A Roads, unless of course you know better.\n\nSaturday was the day of the Lord Mayor's Show, the annual float-ridden shebang returning to the City's streets after 2020's enforced absence. By Sunday morning all the detritus and horse poo had been cleared away and an underling was busy stacking all the gold plastic chairs on the temporary balcony in front of Mansion House. But much more interesting, just around the corner, was the rare sight of the Lord Mayor's Rolls Royce being given a polish by two flunkeys in advance of an official trip to a Remembrance service. And yes, its numberplate really is LM 0, i.e. the highly unusual combination of two letters and a zero. There's a bit of a story behind that...\n\nWhen Sir Rupert de la Bere became Lord Mayor of London in 1952 he acquired the numberplates LM 1 and LM 2 for his cars to commemorate the occasion. But whereas a more civic-minded grandee might have handed the plates on to his successor, Sir Rupert kept them for himself. Then in 1964 the new incumbent Sir James Miller decided that the Lord Mayor's car deserved a personalised plate and, because LM 1 was no longer available, persuaded the authorities to issue LM 0 instead. Other cities around the country have done similar for their dignitaries, especially in Scotland, where Edinburgh's Lord Provost has S 0, Glasgow's has G 0, Aberdeen has RG 0 and Inverclyde has VS 0.\n\nSeveral commemorative services take place in the City of London on Remembrance Sunday, which these days means the streets are crawling with police. My perambulations took me past several road blocks, a fair few vanfuls and a surprising number of armed officers with very prominent big black rifles. They were particularly in evidence around St Paul's Cathedral - the endpoint of LM 0's official journey - where a queue of unusually well-dressed ladies and gentlemen awaited their turn to pass through security and take their seats inside. My photo shows the outdoor assembly at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial on Holborn where an army band awaited the arrival of the massed procession lined up inside Holborn Bars, while across the road a unexplained group of at least thirty mods on scooters had gathered separately to pay their respects.\n\nAt eleven o'clock I found myself nowhere near a ceremony, nor even by a church, but in the heart of the Barbican estate. Initially I thought it wasn't the best place to be, but as I looked around me at the architectural aftermath of war I realised that loss and sacrifice were especially evident here, and the empty silence perhaps even more evocative.\n\nThe sugar content of these nine festive drinks\n\n• Quality Street the Purple One Latte with Light Dairy Swirl: 36g\n\n• After Eight Hot Chocolate with Light Dairy Swirl: 37g\n\n• Quality Street Toffee Penny Latte with Light Dairy Swirl: 41g\n\n• Terry's Chocolate Orange Hot Chocolate with Light Dairy Swirl: 45g\n\n• Toffee Nut Latte: 20g\n\n• Gingerbread Latte: 34g\n\n• Caramel Waffle Latte: 37g\n\n• Egg Nog Latte: 41g\n\n• Fudge Brownie Hot Chocolate: 51g\n\nn.b. all drinks are medium-sized with semi-skimmed milk\n\nn.b. a normal latte has 15g of sugar at Costa and 16g at Starbucks\n\nn.b. a normal hot chocolate has 35g of sugar at Costa and 28g at Starbucks\n\nn.b. a standard 51g Mars bar has 30g of sugar\n\nMeanwhile Christmas approaches unabated. Somerset House is already in full-on ice rink mode complete with giant tree, cocktail lounge and alpine restaurant. Plenty of families were queuing to sign in, having already missed the first 10 minutes of their designated slot, but buzzing with excitement nevertheless. Two adults can expect to pay £36.95 for a weekend spin, including mandatory transaction fee, whereas après-ski wine & fondue in Jimmy's chalet is somehow £68. Spectating remains free. I also note that the Courtauld Gallery is due to reopen next Sunday, having cunningly timed most of its three year refurbishment for a period when it would have had to be closed anyway.\n\nAll the usual Christmas lights are now blazing everywhere else, even in daytime, because it's not Christmas until the Northbank illuminations are lit. Over at Covent Garden Market exactly the same giant baubles and mistletoe are up that have been here every Christmas since 2015, and yet people are still stopping and snapping them excitedly with their phones because for some people they're new and because nobody else has seen them on their feed for ten months. Basically if all you want from a pre-Christmas jolly is pretty lights and Insta-friendly spectacle and somewhere nearby that sells drinks then central London is very much back to normal and waiting for you.\n\nposted 07:00 :\n\n<< click for Newer posts\n\nclick for Older Posts >>\n\nclick to return to the main page\n\nLife viewed from London E3\n\n» email me\n\n» follow me on twitter\n\n» follow the blog on Twitter\n\n» follow the blog on RSS\n\n» my flickr photostream\n\ntwenty blogs\n\nour bow\n\narseblog\n\nian visits\n\nlondonist\n\nbroken tv\n\nblue witch\n\non london\n\nthe great wen\n\nedith's streets\n\nspitalfields life\n\nlinkmachinego\n\nround the island\n\nwanstead meteo\n\nchristopher fowler\n\nthe greenwich wire\n\nbus and train user\n\nruth's coastal walk\n\nround the rails we go\n\nlondon reconnections\n\nfrom the murky depths\n\nquick reference features\n\nThings to do in Outer London\n\nThings to do outside London\n\nLondon's waymarked walks\n\nInner London toilet map\n\n20 years of blog series\n\nThe DG Tour of Britain\n\nLondon's most...\n\nread the archive\n\nAug24 Jul24 Jun24 May24\n\nApr24 Mar24 Feb24 Jan24\n\nDec23 Nov23 Oct23 Sep23\n\nAug23 Jul23 Jun23 May23\n\nApr23 Mar23 Feb23 Jan23\n\nDec22 Nov22 Oct22 Sep22\n\nAug22 Jul22 Jun22 May22\n\nApr22 Mar22 Feb22 Jan22\n\nDec21 Nov21 Oct21 Sep21\n\nAug21 Jul21 Jun21 May21\n\nApr21 Mar21 Feb21 Jan21\n\nDec20 Nov20 Oct20 Sep20\n\nAug20 Jul20 Jun20 May20\n\nApr20 Mar20 Feb20 Jan20\n\nDec19 Nov19 Oct19 Sep19\n\nAug19 Jul19 Jun19 May19\n\nApr19 Mar19 Feb19 Jan19\n\nDec18 Nov18 Oct18 Sep18\n\nAug18 Jul18 Jun18 May18\n\nApr18 Mar18 Feb18 Jan18\n\nDec17 Nov17 Oct17 Sep17\n\nAug17 Jul17 Jun17 May17\n\nApr17 Mar17 Feb17 Jan17\n\nDec16 Nov16 Oct16 Sep16\n\nAug16 Jul16 Jun16 May16\n\nApr16 Mar16 Feb16 Jan16\n\nDec15 Nov15 Oct15 Sep15\n\nAug15 Jul15 Jun15 May15\n\nApr15 Mar15 Feb15 Jan15\n\nDec14 Nov14 Oct14 Sep14\n\nAug14 Jul14 Jun14 May14\n\nApr14 Mar14 Feb14 Jan14\n\nDec13 Nov13 Oct13 Sep13\n\nAug13 Jul13 Jun13 May13\n\nApr13 Mar13 Feb13 Jan13\n\nDec12 Nov12 Oct12 Sep12\n\nAug12 Jul12 Jun12 May12\n\nApr12 Mar12 Feb12 Jan12\n\nDec11 Nov11 Oct11 Sep11\n\nAug11 Jul11 Jun11 May11\n\nApr11 Mar11 Feb11 Jan11\n\nDec10 Nov10 Oct10 Sep10\n\nAug10 Jul10 Jun10 May10\n\nApr10 Mar10 Feb10 Jan10\n\nDec09 Nov09 Oct09 Sep09\n\nAug09 Jul09 Jun09 May09\n\nApr09 Mar09 Feb09 Jan09\n\nDec08 Nov08 Oct08 Sep08\n\nAug08 Jul08 Jun08 May08\n\nApr08 Mar08 Feb08 Jan08\n\nDec07 Nov07 Oct07 Sep07\n\nAug07 Jul07 Jun07 May07\n\nApr07 Mar07 Feb07 Jan07\n\nDec06 Nov06 Oct06 Sep06\n\nAug06 Jul06 Jun06 May06\n\nApr06 Mar06 Feb06 Jan06\n\nDec05 Nov05 Oct05 Sep05\n\nAug05 Jul05 Jun05 May05\n\nApr05 Mar05 Feb05 Jan05\n\nDec04 Nov04 Oct04 Sep04\n\nAug04 Jul04 Jun04 May04\n\nApr04 Mar04 Feb04 Jan04\n\nDec03 Nov03 Oct03 Sep03\n\nAug03 Jul03 Jun03 May03\n\nApr03 Mar03 Feb03 Jan03\n\nDec02 Nov02 Oct02 Sep02\n\nback to main page\n\nthe diamond geezer index\n\n2023 2022\n\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\n\n2016 2015 2014 2013 2012\n\n2011 2010 2009 2008 2007\n\n2006 2005 2004 2003 2002\n\nmy special London features\n\na-z of london museums\n\nE3 -
