        "text": "The remains of an old church by the River Test, hidden from sight.\n\nLaverstoke and Freefolk are two pretty neighbouring villages on the fledgling River Test, in the north of Hampshire. Driving through, you could be forgiven in thinking they are the same village, linked by the Bombay Sapphire Distillery. Not far from the ancient ‘Harrow Way’ and on the main coaching road to the West Country, these premises were formally Portal’s paper mill supplying notes for the Bank of England. That’s quite a lot of history in itself to attribute to these small settlements.\n\nThese days Laverstoke Park is owned by ex Formula 1 champion Jody Scheckter, now an organic farmer and businessman. But hidden from view in the grounds are the remains of old St. Mary’s The Virgin Church,\n\nAlmost 150 years ago, it was made redundant as the parish church to become the Portal family mortuary. Sadly it was to be on borrowed time from that point.\n\nLaverstoke Park\n\n“The undulating park is thickly planted with specimen trees, both native and exotic, much of the surviving planting being from the C20. In the clump of yew trees to the east of the House are the remains of St Mary’s church. After the benefices of Freefolk Syfrewaste and Laverstoke were united the church was remodelled to become a mortuary chapel of the Portal family.\n\nThis work was completed by Melville Portal in 1876.”\n\nHistoric England,\n\nWhy the church was there\n\nThe old church is adjacent and now very much seen in the context of Laverstoke Park. Older sources referred to it as ‘Freefolk House’ which before that was a manor, and both were on land in possession of Hyde Abbey, Winchester.\n\nOriginally the old road went by the church through the grounds of Laverstoke Park. This is my speculation, but the church’s location may have also been due from where it’s parisher’s were drawn. Prior to the printing mill, and factory houses, the area south of the church (and now the B3400), has signs of medieval farming with ‘strip lynchets’ marked on maps today. It is here that there may have been an original settlement, and close proximity to the church.\n\nThe dating of the old church is unknown. We know from the ‘Diocesan Registry‘ held in Winchester, the list of rectors of the Parish of Laverstoke, commences with William de Cryche in 1289, but it looks there was some ‘irregularity’ to his credentials, as well as his age. But this same rector was still around there in 1348!\n\nHow Churches were administered is quite different to now. Between Overton and Whitchurch there was a string of churches and chapels that came under the of guidance of clergy and ‘locum tenens‘, which meant there were temporary and not always present. Historically a ‘Rector’ who would oversee, could be appointed and yet remain quite unconnected to their parish, and a landowner might typically have their say on parish matters.\n\nIn an article by the Hampshire Field Club & Archaeological Society from 1907, it noted The abbots and priors of Hyde Abbey, Winchester were appointed patrons up until 1539, the time of The Dissolution.\n\nThe bell in the turret dated from1624. There are records of furnishings which are detailed here. After the Dissolution, The manor was acquired by ‘The Crown‘, and then on to several landowners. In 1759, the manor was sold to Joseph Portal.\n\n” Previous to 1850 there was neither parsonage house nor school house in the parish. The rectors were generally incumbents of some other parish in the neighbourhood, and lived, for the most part, at some distance from Laverstoke. The only service in the church was matins on Sunday at 1.30 p.m.”\n\nHampshire Field Club & Archaeological Society\n\nSo this little church in the north of Hampshire made it’s way through history, with little fanfare… There was one notable exception:\n\nJane Austen’s brother James was married here…\n\nAs the norm, Parish records were kept and baptisms, marriages and funerals were conducted through the years. One wedding of note was that of Jane Austen’s older brother, James when married has first wife Anne at the Old St. Mary’s, in 1792. The marital service was overseen by their father Rev George Austen. It is curious that this venue was chosen, but the Austen family would have known the Portals, and most likely Jane would have attended.\n\nUp till this point the church and house quietly co-exisited. The old House was pulled down and rebuilt in a form we see today, by Melville Portal (MP) in 1852. But he didn’t stop there. Like Melville’s Grandfather Joseph, who had diverted the old road south of the river and around their estate, landowners loved to fashion their parks to their preference.\n\nAs I have written about with the case of the nearby Baring family, they would seem to prefer to fund a whole new church, in a more suitable location – if there was the choice of gaining more privacy for their estate in the process. As well as being a politician, Portal was later to become Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire in 1852 and later High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1863. He would have had a huge amount of influence. Portal, has been described as a ‘strong minded individual’ and would also later become a lay member of the Winchester Cathedral Committee…\n\nWhy was a new church built?\n\nIn August 1872, The Bishop of Winchester, petitioned to the Privy Council, at a special court at Osborne House. At the request of Portal, the case was made for the uniting of Freefolk and Laverstoke into one Benefice, and thus provision of a new church and school. The Old St. Mary’s would become the family mortuary. By 1876, the refurbishment had been completed. The new St Mary’s wasn’t completed until 1896, so It fell to the chapel at Freefolk to hold regular services in between this period. I wonder if the nature of the identified small congregation helped stifle any resistance there may have been?\n\n(Read the full report here...)\n\nWhat happened to Old St Mary’s?\n\nOld St. Marys became the Portal family mortuary. It was still consecrated\n\nand sat in the grounds of Laverstoke park visible from the house, maybe more obscured as trees were added.\n\nI finally found some reference to images of Old St Mary’s on Overton Pictures It was a joy to discover these, and a bit sad too. Until I saw these images, I could only imagine how the little church looked. It was never grand example, which may have eased the decision to make it redundant.\n\nHold this last image of the interior in mind for later…\n\nBorrowed time…\n\nThe Portal family graves and memorials were dutifully added, but it’s what happened next which caused the most concern. The church had survived Melville, but was in a state of dilapidation and by 1952 was raised to the ground.\n\nIt was still a consecrated building and a final service was held on 13th July, 1952- The old church was to be demolished – 80 years after the remnants of Freefolk Manor had too been destroyed.\n\nIt was in 1953, The Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act came into law which was intended to protect historic buildings.\n\n“An Act to provide for the preservation and acquisition of buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest and their contents and related property, and to amend the law relating to ancient monuments and other objects of archaeological interest”\n\n31st July 1953\n\nUK Parliament\n\nI’m sure the old St. Mary’s church was not a unique one to grapple with for landowners and the costs involved, if it was to be preserved. It might just be a co-incidence the year before this law came into effect that a decision was taken to level it, but you do wonder.\n\nWhat’s left?\n\nBasically a mound. With the help of ‘Google’ was and ‘Bing’ maps, this is the closest we can get to see what’s left of Old St Mary’s…\n\nAny Takers?\n\nThere have been a couple of occasions where by accident, I have discovered the old church furnishings elsewhere which had been saved. I’ve not been looking for them but it all adds to building up a picture.\n\nThere is a church at Hinton Ampner, who had family connections – see the images below.\n\nOne of my favourite chance discoveries was some finding some ‘church debris’ in a local chapel. It was at home I realised when looking at of the photo of the interior what it was, so I made a special trip back to view.\n\nI’m not claiming this small church was anything special, but to me, there looks a familiar theme of how a landowner’s could remove a church ‘in the wrong place’ legitimately from their land, providing they fully contributed to a new church for the parish. It looked a win, win.\n\nSome people say a church is the people not a building. and theologically I go along with that – but I’ve often wanted to raise awareness of this church and its fate – I would have loved to have seen it when it was still standing. It’s the final destruction more than the ‘utility change’ it went through that I find frustrating , especially when you know the importance of 1953 act. So grateful to see the images of what it was like and discover that parts of the fabric still exist."
