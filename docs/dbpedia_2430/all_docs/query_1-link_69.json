        "text": "Streetnames\n\nThis Gazetteer of street names was started by Clinton Davies. It was continued by Bill Dargue initially using information from Vivian Bird 1970 Portrait of Birmingham, Vivian Bird 1991 Streetwise, Joseph McKenna 1986 Birmingham Street Names, and anything by John Morris Jones. It formed part of rather long Word document, A History of Birmingham on your Doorstep, which is downloadable from A History of Birmingham Places & Placenames . . . from A to Y - https://billdargue.jimdo.com/willia...-birmingham-on-your-doorstep-and-other-texts/.\n\nWithin the main entries there are references to other street names - eg. Oak Tree Lane is listed under Selly Oak Road. So if the name you want to find does not appear alphabetically, start from here and run a search. Entries may also have fuller references elsewhere in the text. Run a search. (For easier searching, apostrophes are omitted in names eg. Kings Heath, except in church names eg. St Martin’s.)\n\nMany streets are named from the places they go to.\n\nA - Streetnames\n\nA B Row B4\n\nA-B = Aston-Birmingham; this 19th-century street stood on the boundary between the boroughs of Aston Manor and Birmingham as they were prior to the Greater Birmingham Act of 1911 when Aston amalgamated with Birmingham.\n\nAdderley Road B8\n\nThe name Adderley derives from local 17th-century landowners whose family name may be originally taken from a placename (or vice versa): possibly Anglo-Saxon Aldred's leage = clearing. A public park, Adderley Park was offered to Birmingham town council 1855 by Charles Bowyer Adderley, Lord Norton, but ignored. Norton opened it himself 1855, it was named Adderley Park 1862 and only in 1865 did the council take it over on a 999-year lease for 5 shillings a year. Edmund Road, Ralph Road, Reginald Road are taken from Adderley family forenames. Arden Road is named after the wife of Sir Charles Adderley, equerry to Charles I, who married Anne Arden of Park Hall 1636. A later Charles Adderley married Mary Bowyer 1703 hence Bowyer Road. Hartopp Road is named after Anna Maria Bowyer who married Charles Clement Adderley 1803 and was to be the mother of Lord Norton. Lord Norton married Julia Leigh 1842 hence Leigh Road. Hams Road is named after Hams Hall, a country house built near Lea Marston by the Adderleys 1780. The building was dismantled after World War 1 by shipping magnate Oswald Harrison and re-erected at Coates near Cirencester where as Bledisloe Lodge, it serves as a student residence of the Royal Agricultural College.\n\nAll Saints Street B18\n\nAll Saints Church was consecrated 1833; it was a Rickman & Hutchinson gothic-style church. Originally there were galleries on three sides which were later removed; small spires stood at each corner of the building; these were also later removed. The shallow chancel was added 1881. The church was demolished after 1966.\n\nAlbany Road B17\n\nQueen Victoria's 4th son, Leopold was Duke of Albany & Clarence; Clarence Road and Regent Road are nearby.\n\nAlbert Road B6 B14 B17 B21 B23 B33\n\nMany roads are named after Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert 1819-1901; they married 1840 and Albert was made Prince Consort 1857.\n\nAlbert Road Stechford B33 was originally a boundary road around the medieval Stichford Field.\n\nAlbert Street B5\n\nBirmingham Station in Curzon Street was built 1838 inconveniently away from the town centre. The planned road into town, Albert Street, named after Queen Victoria’s prince consort was so slow in the building that New Street Station was built first 1852 thus rendering the road unnecessary.\n\nAlcester Street Alcester Road B13/ B14 B47/ B48/ B98\n\nThe Alcester Turnpike to Spernal Ash 1767 was created as a through route where none had previously existed giving access from the countryside to the market of the booming town of Birmingham. As with all the former-turnpikes it tends still to be known as 'the' Alcester Road.\n\nAlexandra Road B5\n\nThis building development in the north-eastern corner of Edgbaston took its name from the Danish Princess Alexandra 1844-1925) who married the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII in 1863; also Princess Road.\n\nAlma Street B19\n\nCommemorates a Franco-British victory 1854 on the River Alma in the Crimean War against Russia; similarly Inkerman Street after the Battle of Inkerman 1854.\n\nAlwold Road B29\n\nThe large-scale municipal estate centred on Castle Square was laid out between World Wars 1 and 2. This street was named after the Anglo-Saxon lord of Northfield manor whose hall was Weoley Castle..\n\nArmoury Road B11\n\nSixteen separate gun firms amalgamated 1862 as the Birmingham Small Arms Company, the BSA, with a large mechanised steam-powered factory at Armoury Road The BSA soon diversified into cycle and motor cycle production. The factory closed 1980 and was demolished after 1983.\n\nAnderton Park Road B13\n\nThe Anderton family were important in the area during the 19th century: Rebecca Anderton had St Annes Church Moseley built 1874.\n\nAshleigh Grove B13\n\nThis is a 20th-century development on the site of Ashleigh Grange which was probably a 15th-century hall timbered in pad-and-panel style; it was demolished c1930.\n\nAshted Circus Ashted Row Ashted Walk B7\n\nThe district of Ashted, a late 18th-century development, was named after Dr John Ash founder of the General Hospital whose estate this was until 1788. His house later became the church of St James the Less 1791. The main road through the estate, Ashted Row, running parallel to and north of Great Brook Street, almost disappeared in the redevelopments of the 1960s, though a tiny stretch remains off Nechells Parkway south-west of Ashted Circus. Great Lister Street was named after Sir Lister Holte of Aston Hall who originally leased the land to Dr Ash; Great Brook Street is named after attorney John Brook who bought the lease from Ash; after the latter went bankrupt and the estate was sold and developed for good quality housing.\n\nAston Brook Street B6\n\nAston Brook, also known as Hockley Brook and, nearer its source as The Bourn or River Bourn, runs from Hockley east-west to join the Rea and Tame; it was culverted from the 19th century and is only visible in one or two places including its confluence near Spaghetti Junction. Aston Brook Mill was a fulling mill from at least 1532 until the late 18th century when it became a corn mill operating until c1914. The millpool was in the Pool Street/ Phillips Street area.\n\nAston Church Road B7/ B8\n\nThe route across the River Rea from the Saltley side to the parish church of Aston, Ss Peter & Paul. This was a churchway which had to be maintained by local parishioners. The ford across the River Rea was never an easy one. Also Church Lane B6.\n\nAston Expressway B6\n\nThe A38M Aston Expressway built 1972, the only British motorway to go right into a city centre. Spaghetti Junction is the nickname given shortly after its construction to Junction 6 of the M6 where the A38M joins it, at the time of construction the most complicated multi-level junction in the world.\n\nAston Hall Road B6\n\nAston Hall was built for Sir Thomas Holte probably replacing a moated medieval manor house nearer the river. Building started 1618, Holte moved in 1631 but the house was not completed until 1635. The road was renamed from Aston Lane c1930. Lister Street B7 is named after the last but one of the Holte baronets, also remembered in Holt Street, originally Holte Street. Heneage Legge inherited the Holte estates and is remembered in Heaneage Street B7 and Legge Street B4. Bagot Street B4 commemorates another Holte heir.\n\nAston Street B4\n\nThe road from Birmingham Steelhouse Lane via Gosta Green to Aston was developed with housing in the mid-18th century.\n\nB - Streetnames\n\nBaker Street B10\n\nFollowing Joseph Chamberlain’s election as an MP he was replaced as mayor by George Baker 1875, 1876.\n\nins Lane B28\n\nKnown from 1540 and named after the moated site known as yn east of Kedleston Road, now built over.\n\nBalsall Heath Road B12\n\nA street named from the placename, Balsall Heath Road was built from the Moseley Road to the Pershore Road 1829 as a speculative building investment with large plots of land laid out for Birmingham’s upper middle class.\n\nBarn Lane B13\n\nNamed after an 19th-century barn built in Italianate style by one of the ladies of the Taylor family.\n\nBarrows Lane B25\n\nwas recorded as Bate Lane 1575, possibly a family name. A field name east of the lane Bayt fields is recorded 1495.\n\nBartholomew Row Bartholomew Street B5\n\nWith Chapel Street, named after St Bartholomew's Church which stood between Masshouse Lane and Bartholomew Row. Building costs were subsidised by the Jennens family (See below: Jennens Road.) who were laying out their estate for sale as housing plots; a church increased the attraction to prospective residents. The church was closed 1937 and demolished by 1943.\n\nBath Passage B5 Bath Row B15\n\nBath Row and Bath Passage led to baths at the Lady Well. This was originally a natural spring used by water carriers to supply the town and became the site of Birmingham’s first swimming baths from c1720. The site of the baths is now beneath the Arcadian Centre.\n\nBath Street B4\n\nA street laid out c1760 where a spring ran to the Great Pool of the Colmore estate. Shadwell Street dates from about the same time; ‘shadwell’ signifies a shallow stream.\n\nBath Walk B12\n\nThe first Balsall Heath Baths off George Street/ Edward Road was operating by 1851 using fresh spring water; it had an 30m open-air pool as well as private baths and. This was a high-class establishment, but by 1878 the baths had been condemned and filled in by order of the local health board, wells and springs polluted by nearby cesspits being an increasing problem.\n\nBeak Street B1\n\nHinckley Street derives from Hinckley Field on this site in the Middle Ages; Hinckley in turn derives from Hink’s leage ie clearing. The Hinckley family were so-named by 1300. In the 19th century this became one of Birmingham’s worst slum areas and was known as The Inkleys. Later the Hinckley family home was The Beake at B17 Harborne/ Bearwood Willow Avenue/ Hickory Drive after which Beak Street is named. Beaks Farm/ The Beaks dates from after the enclosure of Rotton Park; it disappeared towards the end of the 19th century. Also B67 Beakes Road. A beak may have been a geographical feature, the particular shape of a hill, or possibly a family name.\n\nBell Lane B33\n\nThe Bell Inn is well over a hundred years old and has given its name to the lane which leads to Marston Green from Mackadown, the original settlement of Sheldon, and from Sheldon Hall known as East Hall (in contrast to Sheldon’s West Hall at Kents Moat). The bridge over Hatchford Brook is marked on the First Edition OS map as East Hall Bridge, presumably the responsibility of the lord of the manor.\n\nBell Lane/ Bell Hill/ Bell Holloway B31\n\nPredating the 1727 Bromsgrove Turnpike, the Bell & Bluebell at Bell Lane/ Bell Holloway was a coaching inn until a new Bell Inn was built on the Bristol Road 1803. This was rebuilt in the second half of the 20th century. There may be a connection with the de Belne family - see Bells Lane B14 below.\n\nBells Lane B14\n\nThe earliest reference to the de Belne family is found in the grant of the manor of Blackgrave to William de Belne by King Henry III. Bells Lane took its name from the family and the 16th-century timber-framed Bells Farm took its name from the lane.\n\nBennetts Hill B2\n\nThe street was laid out c1800 and named after the Hill so-called from the family who previously farmed the land. Edward Burne-Jones was born on the site of the buildings now numbered Nos.11-12.\n\nBerwood Lane B24\n\nBerwood was the name of the manor now covered by Castle Vale. It derives from Anglo-Saxon baer wudu = pigs’ pasture wood; the housing development on Castle Bromwich aerodrome was named Castle Vale with reference to Castle Bromwich in the late 1960s by a schoolgirl in a competition.\n\nBillesley Lane B13\n\nRenamed by association with its apparent destination ie. Billesley Common to the south, but originally this was Bulley Lane 1495 (including Belle Walk) named after the medieval settlement, now the site of Moseley golf club house, of Bulley = bull clearing. Bullan Wyllan ie. Bull’s Spring is mentioned at Billesley Lane/ Blenheim Road in the Yardley Charter of 972 AD.\n\nBiggin Croft B35\n\nCastle Vale was formerly the site of Castle Bromwich aerodrome developed as a housing estate in the late 1960s. Many roads are named after RAF bases: Biggin Hill is an RAF base, also Padgate Close, Tangmere Croft, Upavon Close. Dyce Croft is named after Aberdeen airport, Renfrew Croft after Glasgow airport, Stornaway Road after the Isle of Lewis airport, Sumburgh Croft after the airport of Shetland, Turnhouse Croft after Edinburgh airport. The original tower blocks bore the names of aircraft.\n\nBirchall Street B5/ B12\n\nDerives from Birch Hole Street, probably a medieval topographical name = birch(tree) + hole/ holm deriving from Anglo-Saxon holm = flood meadow.\n\nBlake Lane B9\n\nProbably derived from a medieval name meaning bleak; presumably after deforestation this heathy area degenerated to open scrubland.\n\nBirchfield Road B20\n\nDerived from birch trees or possibly a family name, the hamlet’s name was spelled Birchsfields until c1850. At the end of the 19th century Birchfield House stood at B20 Birchfield Road/ Trinity Road north-east corner. In 1831 Birchfield Road became part of New Walsall Road turnpike, the modern Walsall Road, being more direct than the Old Walsall Road turnpike of 1727. The new road not a highway as such but made into one a using a combination of local lanes.\n\nBlake Street B74\n\nMentioned as the Street though not so-named in the Charter of (Little) Aston and (Great) Barr in which King ?Eadred granted land to one of his ministers, Wulfhelm 957 AD. The Anglo-Saxon implication of street is that this was a Roman road. Blake Street is so-named by 1290 and may derive from Blaca, a personal name, or from black, the implication of this being that the lands had already been cultivated when the new owners came to farm them: Anglo-Saxon or medieval farmers reusing Roman fields?\n\nBlakesley Road B25\n\nBlakeley Lone is recorded 1427, named either after the area or after Blakesley Hall which itself was named after the area. Blakleistoles is recorded in 1316 and appears to mean bleak clearing of withy pollards; these were willows cut regularly at c2m in height to provide long slender branches for fencing or basket-making.\n\nBleak Hill Road B23\n\nDerives from the self-explanatory topographical name, Bleak Hills. The land here is a mixture of sand and pebbles (Bunter sandstone and Bunter pebble beds) formerly heathland.\n\nBlucher Street B1\n\nDating from c1823 this street commemorates the Prussian Marshal Gebhard von Blucher whose troops fought alongside Wellington in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo 1815. Nearby Marshall Street was also named after Blucher.\n\nBoldmere Road B73\n\nThis late 19th-century streetname derives from a lake between B23 Chester Road and Court Lane north end and known variously as Bowen Pool, Baldmoor, Baldmoor Lake, Bolemore Lake. Moor means boggy land. The area took its name from the road name.\n\nBond Drive B35\n\nWhile most street names on Castle Vale derive from aviation (this was an aerodrome until after World War 2), some commemorate members of the City Council during the 1970s when the estate was being built: Bond Drive from Alderman Ernest Bond chairman of the Housing Committee, Thomas Walk after Alderman Dennis Thomas chairman of the Public Works Committee, Watton Green named after the leader of the council, Alderman Harry Watton.\n\nBooths Lane B42\n\nBooths Farm was a c1700 farmhouse incorporating timber-framing from an earlier building. The farm was the centre of William Booth’s forgery industry in the early 19th century; Booth was hanged for his crimes at Stafford Jail 1812. By 1974 the house was in ruins and demolished.\n\nBordesley Green B9\n\nA medieval name, la Grene de Bordeslei, Bordesley’s demesne pasture ie. belonging to the lord of the manor. The road was extended as Bordesley Green East across the River Cole to enable trams to reach Stuarts Road 1928. It was further extended to Station Road and the Meadway built in the early 1960s to Tile Cross and via Bacons End on to Coleshill.\n\nBordesley Middleway B10\n\nPart of the Middle Ring Road opened c1990, formerly had the ancient topographical name Sandy Lane.\n\nBordesley Park Road B10\n\nA 19th-century street name after Bordesley Hall which was built c1750 by wealthy button magnate John Taylor I with c15ha of parkland. The hall was burned down in the 1791 Birmingham Riots, rebuilt but demolished 1840 when the estate was sold for housing development.\n\nBournville Lane B30\n\nBournville was originally part of Bournbrook but renamed in fashionable French style by Cadbury Brothers when they moved their factory 1879 to a greenfield site off Bournville Lane/ Linden Road. Bournville Village was developed from 1900 as a garden suburb initially for Cadbury employees by George Cadbury and centred on the village green Sycamore Road/ Linden Road. The names of these roads may take their inspiration from Camp Wood/ Stock Wood in Acacia Road/ Maple Road. Also part of the original village are Elm Road, Laburnum Road and Willow Road. Ironically Bournville Lane was known until at least 1878 as Oak Lane.\n\nBow Street B1\n\nC1760, Probably borrowed from the London name.\n\nBowcroft Grove B24\n\nThe Earl of Warwick, lord of Sutton manor provided a stone cottage, Bow Bearers Lodge for two retainers to escort travellers across Sutton Chase which was then a desolate and dangerous area renowned for robbers. The lodge survived until it was demolished 1828; Bowcroft Grove is a modern road on the site of a field called Bow Bearers Croft.\n\nBracebridge Road B74\n\nBracebridge Pool was made before 1419 specifically for bream and leased by Richard Earl of Warwick to Sir Ralph Bracebridge of Kingsbury as part of Sutton manor.\n\nBradford Road B36\n\nBuilt in the 1930s with Newport Road to bypass Mill Hill on the Old Chester Road at Castle Bromwich, it is named after the Bridgeman family, Earls of Bradford who bought the manor 1657. The title of Newport is that of the Bradford heir.\n\nBradford Street B5/ B12\n\nNamed c1760 after speculator Henry Bradford who offered plots here free of charge in order to encourage development on his estate. Nonetheless development was very slow. The street provided a new bridge over the River Rea in addition to the old crossing at Digbeth.\n\nBrandwood Road B14\n\nTakes its names from a hamlet at the south end of B14 Brandwood Road near the junction with Broad Lane. The name derives from Anglo-Saxon brende wudu = burnt wood, woodland cleared for farming. This is an old road from Kings Heath to Kings Norton running on higher ground between the valleys of the River Rea and the River Cole/ Chinn Brook from Grove Road, via Monyhull Hall Road and Parsons Hill. Also Brandwood Park Road. Brandwood Grove is a 20th-century development named after Brandwood House, first recorded 1638 but likely to be of older foundation. The house is now a Territorial Army barracks.\n\nBrasshouse Passage B1\n\nThe Brasshouse was built 1781 by the Birmingham Metal Company alongside the Birmingham Canal. The office building is now public house.\n\nBrays Road B26\n\nDr Thomas Bray, rector of Sheldon 1696 founded both the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge SPCK and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel; he was also instrumental in establishing the episcopalian church in Maryland USA.\n\nBridge Road B8\n\nA bridge over the 1838 London & Birmingham Railway across the Pretoria Road c1900.\n\nBridge Street B1\n\nThe Birmingham Canal reached what later became Gas Street Basin by 1771 and this road was built over it probably by 1778.\n\nBrindleyplace B1\n\nNamed 1999 after canal engineer James Brindley 1716-1772 by the property company who developed the project to revitalise this dilapidated area alongside the Birmingham Canal near the city centre.\n\nBristol Road B15/ B29/ B31\n\nIn 1727 the Bromsgrove Turnpike was set up from Birmingham went via B5 Smallbrook (Street) Queensway, B1 Holloway Head, B15 Wheeleys Lane, Wheeleys Road, Arthur Road, Church Road, Priory Road, then via a lost road skirting Edgbaston Park, across Lower Pool dam to cross Bourn Brook at the bridge on B15/ B29 Bristol Road near Bournbrook Road. The route is then B29/ B31 Bristol Road, and over Lickey following the Roman road. In the 1770s a straighter route was made from Smallbrook Queensway via the Horsefair, Bristol Street, and then Bristol Road to join the old road before Bournbrook Bridge.\n\nBristol Street B15\n\nIn the 18th century this was Bath Road, ie. the road to Bath.\n\nBroad Street B1\n\nThis was a field track until the development on St Martin’s glebe land of the high-class Islington estate around Islington Row, Bishopsgate Street, Tennant Street and William Street from c1790. The estate was given a London name to add to its prestige. At this time the street was widened from the town to the Birmingham Canal as Broad Street and as a planned development was much the widest in the town. Before the turn of the century the street was widened as far as Five Ways Edgbaston and known as Islington from the 1780s to the mid-19th century.\n\nBromford Drive B36\n\nBromford Drive and estate were built after 1965 on the site of Birmingham or Bromford (Bridge) Racecourse which had opened 1895. Some streets are named after famous racehorses: Hyperion Road after the 1933 Derby winner, Papyrus Way the 1923 Derby winner, Reynoldstown Road after the 1935 Grand National winner, Tipperary Close after Tipperary Tim the 100-to-1 1928 Grand National winner; Trigo Croft and Ayala Croft are also named after horses. Other roads are named after racecourses: e.g. Newmarket Way, Redcar Croft.\n\nBromford Lane B8\n\nA very old road name, Bromford derives from Anglo-Saxon brom ford = broom (ie. the shrub) ford; the ford across the River Tame was where Bromford Lane crosses the river just north of the junction with Bromford Road.\n\nBrompton Pool Road B28\n\nColebrook Priory Mill/ Bach Mill/ Bates Mill/ Bamptons Mill on Yardley wood Brook is first recorded 1495 and belonged to Colebrook Priory nearby. Priory Road was the dam of Bamptons Pool. The name of Brompton Pool Road is a map misreading of Bampton, the name of the one-time owners. 'Bach' means ' a small stream'.\n\nBromsgrove Street B5\n\nCertainly a medieval road which was the start of the road to Bromsgrove originally by way of Holloway Head, Wheeleys Lane and Church Road Edgbaston before following the Bristol Road.\n\nBrookhill Road B8\n\nThe hill here is recorded as Brokhill (Brookhill) on Tomlinson’s 1759 survey of Little Bromwich manor. The Brookhill estate, including this road, was laid out by the Sutton Trust 1919.\n\nBrook Piece Walk B35\n\nNamed after an old field name (piece = field) and one of few street names on Castle Vale not derived from aeronautical connections; Plants Brook original ran alongside this field. Also derived from field names are Long Close Walk, Orchard Meadow Walk, Round Moor Walk, Rough Coppice Walk.\n\nBrookvale Road B6/ B23\n\nAfter Brookvale Park which was so-named with no historical basis by Erdington Council when Lower Witton Lake and surroundings was bought as a public park c1904. Hawthorn Brook flows into the lake. Also Brookvale Park Road, and Park Road and North Park Road, late 20th-century developments.\n\nBroom Hall Crescent B27\n\nBroom Hall Crescent is a modern road which stands on the site of Broom Hall, a medieval building on a moated site, rebuilt in Georgian times, demolished 1951. The name derives from Anglo-Saxon brom halas = broom nook and is mentioned in 972 AD in the perambulation of the Anglo Saxon Charter of Yardley. Also Broom Hall Grove.\n\nBuckland End B34\n\nFrom Bokenholt, Anglo-Saxon bocen holt = beech wood.
