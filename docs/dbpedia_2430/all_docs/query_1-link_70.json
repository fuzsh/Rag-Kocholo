        "text": "Text in red is from previous blogs and is intended to give a fuller picture\n\nI hope this is OK, as despite being repetition, it brings together details on each ancestor and hopefully creates a more complete picture.\n\n19th August 2023\n\nI have spent some weeks struggling with the Catchesides - the branch related to Grampy's mother Louisa (and thus my great great grandmother), with the usual problems regarding the name. Over the years it has been mis-spelled many ways, but largely Cathersides or Cacherides. I suspect from records I have seen, that it is originally a name from Newcastle and there are many more in that city... (It was probably my 5xgreat grandfather William who married a girl from Suffolk and moved to London in 1760. I have a note to the effect that in 1780 he retained a vote in Newcastle but resided in London). The search engines nowadays do pick up the surname more often than they did, but there are always glaring gaps. So it is with relief, as ever, that I move on to the Cox branch - that of my Grandad's mother Eliza, which has no difficulties in that regard.\n\nStraight away I have made a discovery regarding Albert Charles Cox, one of Eliza's first cousins - the 1921 census shows he wasn't the Albert who died in France in WW1, as I had thought. He can be seen at home with Elizabeth, at 7 Parker Road, South Croydon, with 3 daughters. The death record which fits the fact that this was 1921 and by 1939 Elizabeth was a widow is that of Oct 1927 in Pancras, London, where he probably died in hospital.\n\nAs part of my re-investigation of him, I have seen a group photograph of his family at the occasion of daughter Alice's wedding. She (like me) confounded family genealogists by marrying a Mr Smith - and enough said about that! Unfortunately this means that I cannot find her in 1939, as she is not at home with husband and step-daughter and there are hundreds with her name in the appropriate area.\n\n30th July 2023\n\nI have spent today trying to untangle two ancestors with the same name, father and son, whose details I had mixed up and combined. When ancestors name their offspring after themselves they don't spare a thought for we genealogists who follow them, studying their lives 150 years later... I found an obituary in a local paper of Frederick Herbert Matthews, who died in 1942, and I realised I had both father and son by that name with exactly the same details. So I have deleted and backtracked and can now bring you the correct story - well, as far as it goes! In 2019 I said: I see now that he (Senior) married Ellen Kettlety on 18 Sep 1875 in Bradford-on-Avon, her birthplace. He is with the family in 1881 census, and by then they have 2 children. A third was born shortly afterwards; William Henry, aka Henry, and he can be seen in 1891 census with his grandparents, Ellen's parents, with his siblings, but the parents are nowhere to be seen. In 1901 Ellen resurfaces, calling herself married, but still no sign of Frederick, still in Bradford-on-Avon. She was listed as a woollen-weaver and son Henry a gardener, as in 1911 at 10 Kingston Road, Bradford, with Henry and a boarder. This was the address where she died in 1920, leaving her effects to Frederick junior and Florence, presumably her house to Henry. The only records I could find for Frederick senior, which may explain this, were criminal records for larceny on several occasions, each time with a term of imprisonment. The ones I found were too early to account for these gaps in the census, but he may have started young! (The records I was looking at ended in 1892). There was a death in Warminster, Wiltshire under his name in 1911, which may explain why she said \"married\" in censuses and \"widow\" at her death. Today I was looking at a newspaper article from Oct 1879, reporting on yet another court-case, this time involving what we would nowadays call Domestic Abuse. He would drink too much and then knock Ellen about and on this occasion was fined and \"bound over to keep the peace for 3 months\". She obviously put up with this for another 2 years as son William Henry (Harry) was born 31 Oct 1881 - see above. I think I have located Frederick Senior in 1911 census - predictably enough in a pub! As I said above, I suspect he died later that year. So, when the obituary for his son was written in 1942 he was long gone. It stated that \"Junior\" had died aged 64 after a brief illness, having returned home to Semington after visiting friends in Bradford-upon-Avon. It outlined his career, saying he had joined the Royal Navy in 1897 and fought at the battle of Jutland in 1916, then worked for some years at \"Mr Moulton's factory\" (they made bicycles) and was a Grand Master in the Freemasons but had never married or had children. He had been a Chief Petty Officer in the navy and was a keen angler. I can see him on the 1939 Register at 2 Southville Gardens, Bradford-on-Avon aged 61 and he died 3 years later.\n\n28th July 2023\n\nI seem to have a German theme running through today...\n\nWhen I finally found death details for Elizabeth Kate nee Matthews and her husband Albert Goodall, I found that they died on the same day in the same place, at home in Merseyside, on 12 Mar 1941. Looking it up, this was one of many night-time bombing raids in the area and this was presumably why.\n\nEllen Matthews in 2014 I said: she was born Jan 1843 in Northampton Street to Charles & Jemima nee Ingram. She can be seen in census of 1851 at 1 Arundel Court with parents & sibs. She is next seen at 14 St John Square, Clerkenwell with parents & sibs, working as a purse-maker, aged 18. On 15 Oct 1863 at St Mark's, Myddleton Square, Clerkenwell she married Phillip Carl Schirold, a pocket-book maker so they may have met at work. I am so pleased with the opening up of (some) German records in that I can actually follow her through... They had another marriage ceremony in his home-town of Frankfurt on 2 Dec 1863. As there are no more records for this couple in UK, I assume they stayed in Germany. However, I cannot find death records for them, so maybe they moved on. The rest of the Schirold family are there, always in Frankfurt, and have lovely names: he has one sister Eva, parents Johann Bernard & Anna Maria Ottilia nee Kurtz, grandparents Johan Aloysius & Johanne Eleanore nee Reges, aunts Catharina Elisabetha (married Thomas Hofman), Sabina Christina Johanne and Maria Magdalena Catharina (who unfortunately died aged 18 months in 1802). Sadly his father died when they had only been there a few years, in 1871. 2019 update: I can confirm they remained in Germany after their marriage, as daughter Anna was baptised there on 26 Sept 1864, and unfortunately died there before she was 5 years old, on 18 March 1869. As she was named after Phillipp's mother Anna Maria Ottilia n√©e Kurtz this must have been a great tragedy to all. I have scans of marriage and baptism/death of Anna. Philipp was born 17 Jul 1839 in Frankfurt to Johann Bernhard Schirold and Anna Maria Ottilia nee Kurtz, elder sister Eva born 1831 in Frankfurt and died there aged 48 in 1880. Philipp himself died there on 8 Nov 1882 aged 43. Ellen followed on 3 Jul 1919 aged 76 (can't have been easy to be a Brit in Germany then!) I have seen documents confirming Anna's birth, baptism and death in Frankfurt and also residence there of Philipp and Ellen. As they lost their only child, that branch of my tree died out.\n\n27th July 2023\n\nAnother intriguing detail I wouldn't have known without newspaper reports: regarding Doris Laura Matthews. All I had to say in 2014 was she was born 26 Mar 1903 in Bath to Robert & Florence nee Byfield. She can be seen on census return of 1911 at 36 Wells Road, Bath [one of 3 houses in this terrace bombed in WW2 & rebuilt into flats] with mother & sibs (father was elsewhere). As she never married the next we hear of her is her death in Jan 1977 in Bath, aged 73. In 1939 Register she was at 10 Westgate Street, Bath with her parents and 2 evacuees, Doris described as \"forewoman, finishing room at corset works\". And that was all I knew until her death. However, in Sep 1945 the Bath Chronicle reported on a Yorkshireman Richard Thomas Snell, who moved to 10 Westgate Street later in 1939, in order to work for the Royal Engineers, having joined them in WW1 and served in Egypt and N. Africa. He and Doris were engaged to be married, arranging a wedding for the end of 1945, but he was taken ill in the March and died 7 months later. Incidentally, her father had been with the Royal Engineers in WW1, although I don't know if this was directly related or if it was why they got on so well...\n\n26th July 2023\n\nDorcas Maria Matthews in 2014 I said: she was born 25 Feb 1867 in Clerkenwell to Charles & Maria nee Benson and christened on 17 Mar 1867 at St Thomas Charterhouse. I had such high hopes of an unusual name like Dorcas, but it seems it was an empty gesture, naming her after her grandmother, as after her childhood it was never used & she was called Maria. She can be seen on census returns of 1871 & 1881 with parents & sibs, first at 14 Greville Street, Holborn, then at no. 6 in the latter as Maria, Flower Maker. She was then trained to put her flowers on hats & can be seen in 1891 census at a draper's shop in Hoxton, employed as Assistant Milliner, living with her employer at 191 Hoxton Street [still a shopping street, but with modern buildings, nowadays 191 is a hair salon]. This is where this file gets confusing. On 8 Jun 1885 at St Thomas's church, Bethnal Green (just half a mile from the shop) she married James Pearceson. This surname is a problem - it may be a mis-spelling of the much more common Pearson, but either way comes up with nothing either for the couple after marriage, or for James before. There is also the question of why she was in the census taken 6 years later, single & under her maiden name. I hesitate to disregard either of these documents, as the census confirms her occupation as milliner (as does the marriage) and the marriage document names her father as Charles, fishmonger. I wonder if she lied to keep working, as in those days you had to leave most jobs once married. This doesn't, of course, explain why they both disappeared off the records, though...\n\nAfter this, I despaired of ever finding her as the combination of never using her unusual first name, and mis-spelling her married name led me nowhere. However, I think the newspapers have come to my rescue! I have come across a report of an inquest in June 1886 into a suicidal death at Royal Free Hospital in London. The deceased was one James Pearson, a 19-year-old pieman who took his life by consuming a \"bottle of phosphor paste... rat poison easily procured at an oilman's for a penny\" and died in hospital the next day. Apparently he had married Dorcas on 8 Jun 1885 at St Thomas, Bethnal Green, but the marriage only lasted 6 months, before he took to wandering the streets, homeless. He presented to the Kings Cross police station, declaring having taken the poison, was examined and taken to the Royal Free, where he subsequently died. His brother-in-law Charles Joseph Matthews gave evidence at the inquest, saying he considered him \"deranged in his mind\" and Dorcas testified that he \"had been long out of work, was strange in his manner and used to place a dagger under his pillow\" but they had lived apart for 6 months. This explained why she was in 1891 census under her maiden-name. There is a possible subsequent marriage later that year in nearby Haggerston under the name of Mary Matthews, father Charles, to a Benjamin Meek, but who knows... If this was her she died aged 86 (in 1954) and was buried in Chingford.\n\n21st July 2023\n\nHaving just spent a week in the area adjacent to Wyke Regis, Dorset, I had intended returning to Cliff's Auntie Beat's husband Ern Samways' tree, as they all hailed from this village. However, when I returned to my desk yesterday to research this, I found that there was a glaring error, namely that his great-grandfather Edward appeared to have been born 36 years after his nearest sibling when their mother was 59 (she died the following year - unsurprisingly!) I think I must have attached the wrong Edward, so will leave this for now... I covered this tree sufficiently in April - see below.\n\nBefore I left, I was intending moving on to my father's tree to continue the search for stories in the newspapers, so shall return to that.\n\n2nd July 2023\n\nCharles Robert James Parker (Amelia's brother) had a couple of brushes with fate, reported in the newspapers of the time. I did mention him in 2014, so if you are interested, please look at the 2014 tab above and seek 24th April. Suffice to say here that in 1890s he was living in Gilpin Grove, Edmonton, working as a cabinet-maker. He presumably travelled to work by train because on 14 Jun 1892 he was one of many victims of a train crash, treated at Barts Hospital, but was not one of the 4 deaths. His train (a \"workmen's train\") had just left Walthamstow at 6.30 am and was hit by one coming from Enfield, apparently due to a \"misunderstanding of signals\". Some were treated there, others at the London Hospital in Mile End (one of these was a neighbour of his). 7 years later he was mentioned again, as he was in court regarding his lodger, who on 23 Sep 1899 had been drunk and kicked him and stabbed him with a penknife. After an adjournment the case was dismissed as \"malicious intent was not proved\". This seems very like the crime shows I watch nowadays, as it hinged on the fact that forensics could not prove his wounds were caused by the knife wielded by the perp! Earlier that evening the accused had hit his own wife, but that was presumably ok.\n\nHis son and grandson, both Charles James Robert Parker, did not appear in newspapers.\n\n1st July 2023\n\nAmazing! I didn't know Post Mortem documents were available on Ancestry.co.uk, but have just found that of my Dad's great-aunt Amelia Prangnell nee Parker. She died aged 34, 3 years after marriage, so I had already come to the conclusion it was likely to be childbirth-related, a very dangerous situation for centuries.\n\nIn 2014 I said: she was born 26 Mar 1864 at 11 Aylesbury Place, Clerkenwell to James & Ann nee Lathan and christened there at St John's on 27 Sep 1868 aged 4, with sister Mary Ann & lots of others from the same road. She can be seen in census return of 1881 at 161 St John Street, Clerkenwell, one of four servants to a butcher & his family. Literally on the corner of her street, this was very close to the family home. By 1891 she had graduated to the post of Cook & was working at Deacons Tavern, Walbrook, City of London [a coffee house, until recently a \"modern\" sports bar but now demolished]. On 26 Jan 1895 at St James Pentonville she married Charles Thomas Prangnell (her nephew! Well, not really - he was the son of her brother-in-law of the same name, who married her older sister Eliza, from his first marriage). [building is now converted into apartments] Witnesses were Emily Prangnell & E. Parkinson (my great grandmother), sisters of groom & bride respectively. Unfortunately Amelia died aged 34 in Jul 1898 in the area known as St George Hanover Square - possibly in hospital, probably in childbirth and Charles 8 years later. I can see that she died from an ectopic pregnancy (foetus developing in fallopian tube etc not in the correct place), leading to them finding \"much blood in cavity of uterus\". Both fallopian tubes and ovaries were removed but \"patient never rallied from the shock and died early on Sept 5th\". She was subsequently buried in Islington Cemetery.\n\n21st June 2023\n\nSeeking Hennigs on my Dad's maternal tree in newspapers, I have been chasing probable red herrings. My grandmother Florence Augusta Hennig was ostensibly featured many times, arrested for increasingly violent attacks on pubs, people etc due to being drunk and disorderly. It turned out to not be her, but this woman spent more time in London prisons than out... Likewise I don't know if the Frank Hennig who worked for the BBC and was an author was my ancestor, as I can't find a valid link. He is most famous, I understand, for his autobiography of friend & colleague Fred Streeter, a famous gardener.\n\nThe search for Frederick Charles Edward Hennig was much more productive, as I said below, his marriage to May Bryant in Isleworth a social highlight. Apparently the church was packed, as both families were well-known in musical circles. May had 5 bridesmaids; her sister, Ethel and 3 of her cousins, best man was Arthur and groomsmen were his brothers. I see that May was registered and baptised as Mary, her mother's name, but it was clearly written as May on her marriage certificate and thus in the newspapers of that time. I see that her father ran a laundry locally, then retired to become a publican in Watford, and died there in 1927. Unfortunately Frederick and May/Mary disappear from the records on marriage, apart from tantalising glimpses of (possibly) her in 1930 escaping from Epsom Mental Hospital and a death in Ealing in 1951. But I can prove neither and have found no sign of Frederick.\n\n19th June 2023\n\nContinuing the study yesterday of my Dad's Hennig cousins:\n\nSpring 1907 was not a good time for his Uncle John and family, as the Middlesex Chronicle reported. On 29 Mar 1907, Good Friday, one of the sons was involved in an RTA. It could have been Arthur, discussed yesterday, or brother Frederick or Herbert, riding a motor-cycle between Sunningdale and Windlesham when he collided with a car coming in the opposite direction (driven by a Mrs Robinson from West London, taking 3 passengers to Bournemouth). He was seriously injured and was taken to the Nursing Home in South Acton and remained there for some time, recovering. During this time his brother Ernest was taken ill with appendicitis and on 3 May underwent an operation to remove it, but unfortunately did not survive. He was only 25 at the time and in the article I learned a lot more about him again. \"A young man of a high order of ability. He had already won prizes in the London Chamber of Commerce examinations and only a fortnight ago sat his final exam for London University. He was expected to attain a gold medal. He took a great interest in the Isleworth Chess & Draughts Club, of which he was Hon. Secretary and one of the founders.\" All the family had celebrated together 18 months previously at the marriage of eldest son Frederick to May Bryant - more probably here at a later date.\n\n18th June 2023\n\nAs today is Father's Day and it being time to \"go around again\" in studying the trees, I thought I'd launch the Matthews tree, my Dad's, and started with his mother's paternal branch, the Hennigs:\n\nArthur Henry Hennig - (Dad's 1st cousin) In 2013 I said: \"he was born 29 Sep 1877 at 1 Bloomsbury Street, Bloomsbury, London [now a bookshop] to John & Henrietta nee Purser and christened there at St George's on 28 Oct 1877. He can be seen on census return of 1881 aged 3 at 30 Dante Road, Newington [now a modern estate] with parents and brother Herbert. In 1891 I cannot find the family, although we do know they are still in Newington, as his brother Stanley was born there about 3 weeks after the census. By 1901 census they have moved to Isleworth and he can be seen at \"Ecclesfield\", Castle Road with parents & sibs, listed as a Tin & Metal Plate Worker. In 1911 census this house has been given the number 52 and he is still here with parents & brothers, working as a panel-beater. On 20 Jun 1914 at St Mary's, Osterley he married Minnie Biggs, school teacher. From electoral roll records I can see that they both lived at 60 Thornbury Road, Isleworth from at least 1921, and maybe from their marriage. Just a little way down this road was the school where Minnie may well have worked, as they had no children of their own [A modern Health Centre stands on the site now]. On 1 Feb 1951 Arthur died aged 73 and his death was registered in the Ealing district. He left effects worth ¬£4408 to Charles William Venning, barrister & legal editor. Minnie continued to live in the house until at least 1965, when electoral records cease at present. She died aged 93 in the Richmond area in Jan 1980.\" 2018 update: \"In 1939 Register he can be seen, as expected, at 60 Thornbury Road, Isleworth .He is shown as a 62-year-old panel-beater, working on cars, but the odd thing is that Minnie is still redacted, despite being born over 100 years ago and died nearly 40 years ago, outliving Arthur by 29 years - all reasons for unredacting her. I cannot find a scan etc for his death and burial. By the time Minnie died in 1980 aged 93 she was living in a nursing home called Oketon in Teddington\n\n1921 census finds them, as expected, at 60 Thornbury Road, Arthur a sheet metal worker on motor cars aged 43y9m. He was an employer himself, working at Mersey Street Arches, which is now Latimer Road tube station in Notting Hill. Minnie was on Home Duties, assisted by a 23-year-old domestic servant.\n\nThis was the account in 2022 but I have now found a newspaper report of his funeral and it fills in so much! Unfortunately when all you have are the bald facts from documents etc the \"person\" is often lacking. The Middlesex Chronicle said he was \"a well-known personality in Isleworth, where he had resided for over 50 years\" and Minnie was a Councillor, Member of Heston & Isleworth Borough Council. After leaving school, Arthur was apprenticed to a \"well-known firm of art-metal workers and he later took up sheet metal work as this gave him more scope for his ability and knowledge. He gained honours certificates in maths and metallurgy and was a great authority in alloys. For some years he was a lecturer at the Borough Polytechnic in South London and the City & Guilds Institute of the City of London appointed him as an examiner in metallurgy and sheet metal. He also collaborated with others in writing books on these subjects. He was extremely musical and possessed an excellent baritone voice. He was trained under Italian professors at the Guildhall School of Music and gained the gold medal at the completion of his studies. He was a soloist at St Anne's Church, Kew and for over 14 years was a member of the Royal Choral Society, then a member of the choir at St Mary's Church, Spring Grove, but had to give up singing when he became profoundly deaf. He was a member of the Whitton Lodge of Freemasons from the beginning, retired from business at the outbreak of war but took up work again as his contribution to the war effort and then retired for a second time.\" Minnie \"lived locally for the whole of her life. She was for many years headmistress of Ealing Road School, Brentford\" and retired Christmas 1950, just before Arthur's death. She still lived at 60 Thornbury Road until at least 1965, but by 1980 when she died, she was at Oketon Nursing Home in Teddington.\n\nupdating with 1921 census\n\n22nd May 2023\n\nGoing through the ancestors mentioned in local newspapers:\n\nAgar Lloyd Retallick - it helped a lot to see from 1921 census that he was (at least in his teens) known as Lloyd, so I was able to trace him in 2 newspaper references. In 1923 aged 14 he passed exams in Maths and English at school in Treverbyn and later in life 1940 he and his parents attended the funeral of Martha Minear and sent a floral tribute.\n\nUnfortunately all news records are too late for Albert Retallick, although he died aged 21 and I hoped he would be mentioned.\n\nAlfred Retallick won a prize at a fete in Oct 1914 in Ilsington, and performed in a show at the school in Jan 1915, then in Aug 1923 a report of his marriage to Alice French. He was in court in 1938 regarding a horse he bought from another farmer, lost and was fined ¬£15.\n\n21st May 2023\n\nPressing on with checking the new records, I have ventured into the next family, the Retallicks.\n\nUnfortunately I have straight away found just what we genealogists dread - reports of court cases involving our ancestors. (Mind you, there is a part of me that loves Crime drama!) But to me the worst part is the disproving of a record I had attached.\n\nAgar Alexander Retallick - see 21 Oct 2022 below.\n\nHe was the 3rd cousin once removed who was a Police Sergeant in Blackheath. I had thought his wife died in 1939 but realise she was still around in 1947 when a divorce was granted to her on the grounds of his cruelty. The newspaper article used their full names, so I am confident it was them. Apparently several times over the course of their 11-year marriage he threatened her with gun or knife, but she said she was tough. She finally brought him to court and a decree nisi was issued. She had left him in 1945 and now lived with her parents at the Princess of Wales pub Blackheath. After the divorce I'm not sure if she reverted to her maiden-name of Nichols, and if she moved on after her parents died in the early 1950s. Agar lived in Blackheath for some time, but left the police force (maybe was removed after the court case), working as a security officer for the Foreign Office. When he died aged 89 the event was registered at Bodmin, but 1997 is too recent for much detail.\n\n20th May 2023\n\nI have been checking the local newspapers for news of Wilson Manhire, one of the famous musical ancestors on this tree. I have studied 141 articles mentioning him and built up a picture of his life. He was Oliver's First Cousin.\n\nI think I can do no better than to bring you the article published in July 1942 after his death:\n\nDeath of Mr Wilson Manhire, Noted Cornish Composer\n\nThe passing of Mr Wilson Manhire of Bugle on 17 July 1942 came as a shock to musicians in mid-Cornwall, although to his immediate friends and relatives his death was not unexpected in view of the grave illness which began last August and the suffering which he has borne so patiently during the past few weeks. Musically, Cornwall is the poorer for his death and few have achieved such a reputation as he had gained for music in almost every branch of the divine art. He was born at Molinnis in 1884 and in his teens he entered the school profession. It was evident from the first, however, that music was his chief forte and it was not long before he became a teacher of music with Bugle as his centre and here hundreds of pupils passed through his hands in the course of a generation, some gaining advanced certificates of the R.C.M.,R.A.M., G.S.M and T.C.M. With regard to his own skill as a performer, he astonished his friends when at 12 years of age he played the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" with considerable skill. He underwent a course of training at the hands of Mr W.L.Twinning F.R.C.O, formerly of Bodmin but now organist of St Mary's Church, Torquay, and he has always spoken of him with great affection. For some years he was organist at the Primitive Methodist Church at Molinnis. In 1907, 23 years of age, he won the Licentiateship of the Royal Academy of Music for piano playing and in the same year he became a Fellow of Trinity College. In the next year he won the Associateship of the Royal College of Music and in 1909 aged 25 he became Fellow of the Guildhall School of Music. Of his many remarkable successes in examinations held by the best known musical institutions in our land, he looked upon his securing the Gold Medal of Associated Board of R.C.M. and R.A.M. - a test open to all England - as his finest achievements. As a pianist in his prime he had few equals in the West of England. He was a skilled violinist too, and played First Violin on several occasions at the Handel Festivals, held at the Crystal Palace, His services were in wide demand in operatic societies in the county and for a good many years he was the leader of the orchestra supporting Bugle Choral Society and his skilled leadership in this proved an invaluable aid to this mid-Cornwall venture. In leading musical circles, particularly in London, he will be known best of all for his numerous compositions for piano, violin and orchestra while his songs, part songs and carols have provided both interest and pleasure to many vocalists and choirs. His knowledge and experience in teaching anre reflected in his many and excellent text books in music, which have always received a good Press. His printed compositions exceed 750 and it is known that publishers have in recent years secured the rights of issuing upwards of 250 works of his which have not as yet appeared in print. Unlike many musicians who give music a rest when on holiday, Mr Manhire would travel the Continent for weeks at this time of year and there were few Continental orchestras of renown which he had not heard on several occasions when his so-called \"vacations\" came round year by year.\n\n18th May 2023\n\nRemaining lost 2017 notes:\n\nRichard Williams Manhire was born Feb 1825 at Colevreath, Roche to George & Mary nee Snell and christened there on 28 Mar 1825. He can be seen in 1841 census aged 15 at Pentivale, Roche with parents & sibs. On 5 Jan 1850 at the Ebenezer Chapel, Luxulyan, he married Martha Stephens. Richard was a Tin Miner, as so many others, and when their first baby was born, it was at the Union Workhouse in Bodmin. This usually meant a couple couldn't afford a doctor and there may have been complications. In 1851 census they can be seen at Burney, Roche (near Carbis) with baby son William aged 3 months. He was born at the turn of the year and registered Jan 1851 at the workhouse, but unfortunately died a year later in Roche. He was speedily followed a year later by another William, then 5 more children over the next 10 years. Five out of seven births survived and they can be seen in 1861 with them, at Brea, Illogan, 25 miles from Roche. Unfortunately Ann (b1860) and James (b1862) died in 1870. So in 1871 census they had 4 children and lived at Roskear Fields, Camborne, a little further west. See Mary below, who left home, married and went to Australia. By 1881 all the children were gone and Richard was trying his hand at Clay Labouring at Retew. By 1891 son David had died aged 30 and his daughter Ella was looking after her grandparents in Wesley Street, Camborne, where Martha died in 1893. There followed, according to a couple of articles in The Cornishman, a time of scandal and chaos. Richard married a young lady Katie Goodman, 50 years his juniorand then abandoned her when she was about to give birth. I can see that baby Florence was registered Jul 1894 and Richard died in 1900 in the Union Workhouse.\n\nRosalind Manhire was born 28 Sep 1901 in Carbis, eighth of Felix & Annie's twelve offspring. She can be seen there in 1911 census aged 9 with parents & sibs. In Dec 1925 in St Austell in St Austell area she married Archie Vercoe, a farmer and they lived at Goss Moor for many years, farming in an area called White Rose. They were in that area in 1939, although I cannot find any of this branch in 1939 or 1921. They had a daughter Miriam in Oct 1926 - I found this out from Rosalind's death records, but she too is missing in 1939. She married Alfred Brewer in 1949 and had 2 children, but that's all I know. Rosalind died 4 Apr 1982 in Camborne and Archie 1984 in the St Austell area. In 1982 Rosalind lived at 10 Trerice Terrace, St Dennis\n\n17th May 2023\n\nI have reached the point at which I commenced 1921 census last year, so may have little further to report to you. I shall continue to check for new records, but if you have any suggestions please don't hesitate to contact me on diane27@gmail.com - many thanks.\n\nIn the mean time, as I explained last week, I lost a chunk of copy on my 2017 page, so will enter it here, for completeness' sake (searches etc):\n\nMaria Manhire (Jessie's great-aunt) was born Jun 1845 in Roche to George and Jane nee Hewitt/Trethewey and christened 6 Aug 1845 at St Erme. She can be seen in census of 1851 aged 6 at Colevreath with parents & sibs, then with them in 1861 aged 15 at Gunbarrow, apparently working as a CCL. By 1871 they had settled at Molinnis and she can be seen with parents, grandfather & brothers. In Oct 1880 in St Austell she married James Hewett. They settled in Molinnis and in 1881 census can be seen there with daughter and her father George, next door to her brother Thomas and Hannah. Jane was followed only a few days after the census by William, registered as such but christened Willie and always called that. Unfortunately Maria had another baby in the July quarter of 1883 who died aged 4 weeks and she did not survive the birth either. He was buried at Treverbyn on 14 Sep 1883 but the record is incomplete, so may have had Maria on it too. James remarried in 1885 to Ann Hore and died in 1924.\n\nTwo babies died by the name of Mary Manhire, but one survived, so I can tell her story. She was born Jan 1856 in Roche to Richard & Martha nee Stephens, registered as \"Menear\". She can be seen in census of 1861 at Brea, Roche with parents & sibs, aged five, By 1871 they were living in Camborne and she was working as \"Girl at Mine\". They were a hard-working family: her brother William was \"Tin Miner Under Surface\", father and brothers David (17) and Andrew (13) worked \"at surface\". On 22 Dec 1877 at St Austell she married Thomas Henry Masters, farmer's son, and on 11 Sep 1878 he went out to Brisbane, Australia to investigate emigrating. Mary stayed behind to look after their young son, another Thomas Henry, until her husband called for her to join him, which she did with little Thomas on 24 May 1881 aboard the Zamora. Once settled in Brisbane, Thomas ran a grocer's shop and Mary gave birth to another 11 children. Unfortunately 4 of these died in infancy. Electoral roll records show them in 1903 at Kedron Park Road, Wooloowin, then in 1919 at Lutwyche Park Road, Windsor, both showing as a grocery, Thomas Junior worked as a carter, maybe doing deliveries for his father . Daughter Edith certainly worked as a shop assistant. By 1937 Thomas Senior had retired and lived at 27 Norman Street, East Brisbane and they both died in 1939 and were buried nearby in Lutwych Cemetery.\n\nMary Ann Manhire was born May 1817 at Carwallen, Roche to John & Philippa nee Knight and christened in St Austell 2 Jun 1817. She must have been around in 1841 and 1851 censuses but I cannot locate her. She died Jul 1855 in Charlestown, St Austell aged 38 and was buried there 15 Jul 1855.\n\nUPDATING THE ANCESTORS WITH 1921 CENSUS RECORDS\n\n16th May 2023\n\nLilian Tabitha Manhire was born 27 Nov 1914 in the St Austell area to Samuel & Hannah nee Ham, so can be seen aged 6 in 1921 census at Treviscoe, St Stephens with parents and sibs - see brother Lewis yesterday. In Jan 1935 she married neighbour John T Snell in St Austell and they had 2 daughters. In 1939 Register they can be seen at Hendra Downs, John a china clay millworker, Lilian UDD and a closed file, who must be daughter Sheila. He died aged 71 on 3 Aug 1985 and was buried in Churchtown Cemetery St Stephens, joined 3 years later by Lilian.\n\nLona Armenia Manhire was a spinster lady who worked as a nurse. She was born in Apr 1886 to Thomas and Hannah nee Yelland (she was sister of Jasper, Wilson etc), who did not go with the family to London, but stayed with her sister Verena in Cornwall, then went to work in Plymouth, as a nurse in the household of a Royal Navy Commander. She died on 4 Dec1956 her address given as 1 Armenia, Molinnis Crossing, Bugle. She left effects worth ¬£1970 to her niece & nephew. 2017 update: 1939 Register at Molinnis Crossing, Bugle with brother Wilson, at that time Teacher of Music. Lona UDD. 1921 census showed her living with John Warne & family, working as his housekeeper. This was her sister Elizabeth's family, and sister Ethel was at that time looking after Wilson at the Crossing.\n\nLouie Edith Manhire was born at 5 Adelaide Street, Camborne to William & Eliza nee Bennetts in Oct 1889, and can be seen on the censuses of 1891, 1901 & 1911 there with the family. In 1911 she is listed as factory hand at a fuse factory, no doubt the Bickford-Smith Company, whose building is still there, apparently (manufacturing fuses for use with explosives in mining, not electric fuses, as I first thought...) In Jul 1914 in Camborne she married James Henry Thomas, who appeared to be one of these Cornishmen constantly crossing the Atlantic, and this may well have been how they met. In 1919 they had a son Donald, born in Camborne, but they are next seen in 1922, living at 1 Martin Bowes Road, Woolwich, London, listed on the electoral roll there. Until 1948, listings name Louie and James, then at the same address from 1948 James and Donald until 1960, when the records stop (James died in 1962 anyway). His probate document shows James died at the same address and left effects worth ¬£892 to son Donald, a labourer. Louie died on 14 Jan 1948 and was buried at Eltham Cemetery on 20 Jan. James followed in 1962. 1921 census showed them at 1 Martin Bowes Road, Eltham, as expected, James a General Labourer employed by a builder, Louie UDD and Donald aged 2. 1939 Register the same, James then a Munitions Worker at Woolwich Arsenal, filling cartridges, Louie UDD, Donald 20 a Machinist/Lathe Hand.\n\nLucy Manhire was born Apr 1857, 8th of John's 11 with Elizabeth nee Johns and can be seen on 1861 census at Hillyvreath aged 4. In 1871 census I cannot find her but she would be 14, possibly in service somewhere. In Apr 1877 in the St Austell area she married John Cock, coachman from Parkwoon, Roche and they can be seen there in censuses of 1881-1901 with a selection of their 10 living children (one, Cuthbert, died in infancy). In 1911 they were at West End, Roche and John was now working as a clay miner with his 2 sons Frederick & Samuel. Lucy died there the following year then John in 1924. 2019 update: the stone in Roche Cemetery: Inscription reads: \"In loving memory of Lucy, the beloved wife of John Cock, wo died at West End, Roche Jan 14 1912 aged 54 years One of the truest, one of the best, God in his mercy called her to rest. Also Cuthbert Charles, their youngest son, who died Feb 7 1899 aged 4 months.\" 1921 census showed them at West End, Roche, John having remarried in 1914. So he was shown with wife Elizabeth and daughter Gladys both Home Duties, he a clay labourer at St Dennis.As he died in 1924, by 1939 Register Elizabeth was a 64-year-old widow with Private Means.\n\nLucy Ann Manhire was born 19 Mar 1883 in St Austell to Samuel and Elizabeth nee Williams, 9th of their 11, and can be seen in censuses of 1881 & 1891 at Goonbarrow, in the former with parents and sibs in the latter housekeeping alone with her father, her mother with sister Julia in Acton, presumably helping with her 3 little children. In Feb 1905 she married Francis Vosper in the Bible Christian Church and they had 3 sons. 1911 census showed them at 6 Lipson Hill Terrace, Plymouth, Francis a seaman in the Royal Navy - his list of trips is huge and lasted until 1919 at least. Having said that, I can't locate him in 1921 so he may still have been at sea then. Lucy can be seen then at 4 Dunbar Road, Portsmouth with her 3 sons and 17-year-old cousin Winifred, studying part-time. By 1939 Register, Francis was on a naval pension, aged 61, working as a hotel Hospitality Porter in Plymouth. Lucy was UDD. She died in Jul 1959 and he the following Feb, both in Plymouth.\n\n15th May 2023\n\nLeonard Manhire2 was born 23 Aug 1903 to Archibald & Rosina nee Barber - see 7th May below - at Shilton, Stenalees and can be seen there in censuses of 1911 & 1921, in the latter a 17-year-old labourer with mother and brothers. In Apr 1928 in st Austell he married Winnie Cornelius and they had a son the following year Leonard Gordon. 1939 Register showed them at Greensplat, St Austell, Leonard still a general labourer and the boy at school aged 11. By the time he died in Aug 1998 aged 95 they were living in Oswestry, Shropshire. Winnie followed in 2000 and he was moved to be buried with her at Oswestry Cemetery (I'm not sure where he had been prior to this). Two other things I know about Leonard were that he was a bandmaster of Greensplat Silver Band, and was featured in a newspaper article in 1930 when his dog fell down a disused mineshaft on the walk home from visiting Rosina, was feared dead, but on returning next morning Leonard organised a bunch of friends and colleagues to lower him down on a wire rope to rescue him none the worse for his adventure.\n\nLeonard Raymond Manhire was son of Leonard1, mentioned yesterday, born 26 Jan 1914 in Redruth. 1921 census showed him aged 7, although his father called him \"Raymon Menhere\" (and his sister \"Gwennie Menhere\") at Pendarves Street, Tuckingmill, Camborne, at school. On Christmas Eve 1938 in Plymouth he married Vera Jessmond Weight. I recognised this surname as it was that of the friend his father was arrested with in search of the stolen rabbits - evidently his partner in crime! 1939 #register showed Leonard and Vera living at 6a Lansdowne Place, Plymouth with Vera's parents. Leonard was by then a Steward in the Naval Barracks nearby, his father-in-law a typewriter mechanic. As usual the females were UDD. Daughter Maureen was born in 1940. By 1964 Leonard was living at East Tolgus House, Old Portreath Road, Redruth, which is very close to the old arsenic works, but this doesn't seem to have affected them, as he died in 1992 aged 76 and Vera in 1994 aged 74.\n\nLewis Cyril Manhire was born 1 Sep 1908 to Samuel & Hannah nee Ham, shown in 1911 census at South End, Treviscoe, St Stephens with parents and sibs, at the age of 2. In Jul 1933 at Hendra Methodist Chapel he married Freda Best (always seemingly spelled Freeda) but I can't see that they had any children. 2019 update: in 1939 Register, they were at 6 Virginia Terrace, St Stephen. At no. 2 Virginia Terrace was a Frederick & Elizabeth Best, but I can't see that they were related to Freeda. Lewis was a Clay Labourer, heavy worker, and Freeda UDD. There was a closed file too, but probably a lodger as I can't see that they had a child. This file is still closed. 1921 census showed Freeda aged 14 at Hendra Lane, St Dennis with parents & sibs. I eventually tracked down Lewis, he and his family transcribed as Manline and eluding all searches! They were at Central Treviscoe, St Stephens, his father a mason, eldest brother Edward 17 a labourer, the other children at school. When he died 28 Oct 1985 he was at home in 2 Pocohontas Crescent, Indian Queens, leaving ¬£40,333\n\nIn 2012 I said: Lilian Manhire was the lady who married her first cousin Jasper - oops, I didn't tell their story, so I may as well now. He was born Aug 1870 to Thomas Manhire & Hannah nee Yelland, and Lilian to Richard Manhire & Tahpenes Knight (Clive's great grandparents) in Dec 1880, both in Roche. Of course, Lilian moved to London with her family & grew up in Battersea, but in 1901 she was living with her grandparents in Bugle, St Austell, working as a housemaid. Thus, she was in close proximity to Family & in 1906 married her first cousin. They settled in Bugle & had 3 children, Kenneth, Edgar & Dorothy. In 1920 Jasper died and left ¬£783-worth of effects to Lilian & his brother Wilson (who was a fairly famous musician & author - more at a later date). She remained in Cornwall, as a widow, until she died on 7 Mar 1955 at a lovely-sounding address: Grendor, Tehidy Road, Tywardreath. She left ¬£1575 to her son Kenneth, schoolmaster. 2017 update: Jessie's uncle Jasper was brother of Elizabeth & Woodman, soon also of Verena, Ethel, Wilson & Lona. He can be seen in census of 1871 aged 8 months at Netley with parents & sibs, then in 1881 and 1891 at Molinnis, in the latter listed as CCL. On 24 Oct 1891 he sailed with his brother Woodman on board the SS Orotava to Adelaide, Australia to mine for gold. They remained in Australia for 4 years but gold had been (re)discovered in South Africa in 1886 and they joined the gold-rush to that country, sailing in 1903 aboard SS Wakool from Adelaide to Natal. Both Woodman & Jasper sailed \"home\" and in Apr 1906 in the St Austell area Jasper married his first cousin Lilian. This used to be frowned upon but Queen Victoria had made it acceptable some 65 years before. Lilian & Jasper had 3 children, despite him returning to Cape Town to work again with Woodman. He did leave him behind and returned to UK, so in 1911 census he can be seen with Lilian and 2 children at Bilberry. Jasper died 4 Mar 1920 aged 49, leaving ¬£784 to Lilian and their brother Wilson, at that time an assistant schoolmaster. Lilian joined Jasper in the grave in 1955. In 1939 Register Lilian can be found at Kengarthy, Bugle with son Edgar. 1921 census thus just missed Jasper, and Lilian can be seen at Bilberry, a 40-year-old widow with 3 school-age children. She worked from home as a dressmaker.\n\n14th May 2023\n\nJessie's 1st cousin Kenneth Croydon Manhire was born 11 Feb 1907 in Bodmin to Jasper & Lilian. He can be seen in 1911 census in Bilberry, Bugle aged 4 with parents & brother. On 21 Jul 1928 he graduated with a London University BA in English and worked as a School Teacher. On 10 Aug 1934 he set sail for Quebec on the liner SS Manchester Division. He worked on a 1-year exchange, teaching in Ontario, then returned24 Jun 1935 from Detroit to Plymouth via New York on the SS President Harding. He evidently returned to Bugle for a short while, as I have seen a newspaper clipping showing he was involved in a Sale of Work and a concert on 19 Apr 1938. The following year, however, 1939 Register showed him living at Dovegreagh, Garstang Road, Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, working as a school teacher and lodging witha wholesale fish merchant and family. In Apr 1940 in Fylde he married Ida Fielding from Oldham and they had 2 sons in Blackpool. However, they must have retired to Norfolk as when both Kenneth & Ida died in 1997 it was there, Kenneth in January and Ida in May. 1921 census showed him aged 14 at Bilberry with widowed mother and sibs, Lilian a dressmaker and all the children at school.\n\nLeonard Manhire was born 19 Sep 1886 to William & Eliza nee Bennetts at 5 Adelaide Street, Camborne, he can be seen on 1891 & 1901 censuses with the family there. In 1901 he is listed as a 14-year-old butcher, but that didn't last long (or may even be an error). He is next seen criss-crossing the Atlantic, like many of his family, listed on his journeys as a miner. In 1906 he travelled to USA on the SS St Paul and again in 1909 on SS St Louis, then I have also found him on a return journey in Apr 1911, which explains his absence from the 1911 census (the St Paul again, an American ship). On 4 Jan 1912 in Camborne he married Beatrice Lavinia House, who was the servant of his brother Edward, and they managed to have 3 children: Leonard Raymond, and 2 \"attempts\" at Gwendoline Mavis (one died aged less than a year). I am surprised, because he was forever off somewhere: I have found trips from Cape Town to Southampton in 1914 on the SS Grantully Castle, West Africa to Plymouth on the Farquah in 1915, West Africa to Liverpool on the Apapa in 1917 and in 1921 Tenerife to Liverpool on the Abinsi. And if I have found these, there must numerous others (including of course the return journeys). Beatrice died in 1955 in Camborne aged 66, and Leo followed in 1974 aged 88. 2017 update: updating this file I found a newspaper clipping from 1915 where he was being questioned (when attempting to obtain the licence for the Coach & Horses Inn, Breage) about his military service. As he was 29 years old they said he should be serving his country. He stated he had served for a year in Africa and contracted malaria. He did evidently obtain a licence in Camborne, but it may have been in Beatrice's name, as when a fire was reported there, he was said to be \"at work\" elsewhere. 1921 census showed him just returned from one of his trips (Tenerife), living at Pendarves Street, Tuckingmill, Camborne. Leonard was a 33-year-old \"Underground Gold Miner at Ashante Gold Fields, West Africa\" Out of Work, and Beatrice Home Duties. Both children at school. In 1939 Register they appear to have completely separate lives, he registered at Lower Tregantle Cottage, St Germans, a 53-year-old General Farm Labourer, with a family of labourers and another lodger. Beatrice was at 41 Wesley Street, Camborne, with several other married ladies and daughter Gwendolyn, who was 21 and a \"flower buncher\". Beatrice had been at this address a few years before, when she appeared in the newspaper having found her post-operative neighbour (who she had been looking after) had fallen out of bed and died. Leonard too appeared in the paper again, in 1942 when he was fined for \"trespassing in search of rabbits\" and had his nets confiscated. Beatrice died 28 Jun 1955 aged 66, Leonard 28 Sep 1974 aged 86, buried together in Camborne Cemetery with Gwendoline joining them on 4 Oct 2013 aged 96.\n\n13th May 2023\n\nI probably should explain that I reported in 2017 concerning what I termed the \"ladder of Johns\" i.e. the 7 generations of John Manhires. Today I have two problems with this: most of them do not appear in my update as they were not around in 1921, and I lost a lot of the 2017 information in an online \"accident\". I have tracked down a printed copy of my notes, and can bring you the relevant copy here.\n\nSo I shall move swiftly on to the chap I called \"John Manhire7\". He was one of John 6's eleven children, born 20 Sep 1845 in Roche to John and Elizabeth nee Johns and registered in Jan 1896 spelled Mennear. He can be seen in censuses of 1851 & 1861 as sister Hannah below with parents & sibs, in the latter aged 15 a china-clay labourer (CCL). On 26 May 1866 in St Austell Register Office (they were both underage) he married Harriet Best, daughter of fellow clay worker Edward Best. They established a dynasty of their own by having eleven children themselves, although 3 died young. In census of 1871 they can be seen at Higher Colevreath, Roche, John working as an Engine Driver at Clayworks, when they have 2 sons at home (Theodore and Archibald). Theophilus was born 4 months later, then died the following year and daughter Hannah was with her maternal grandparents in St Stephens. According to the dates in the Family Bible, they had a house built in 1872. By 1881 they had 5 children living at home, in Hensbarrow, St Austell (where they had moved in 1880). When they reached 1 Dec 1884 they had lost 2 of their 8 children, so all the survivors were baptised at Treverbyn en masse and all the surviving family can be seen at Bonney, St Austell in 1891, when John was described as \"engine fixer\", Theodore also a Stationary Engine Driver, Archibald and Theophilus CCLs. John and Theophilus worked together and, according to a newspaper article of Aug 1899, socialised together too - they were reported in court accused of being drunk after hours at the Carthew Inn and fined. Theophilus had just purchased his discharge from the Navy, so they may have been celebrating that, but we will never know... By 1901 they had moved to Stenalees and 5 children were at home (including Theophilus), all 3 boys CCLs. In 1911 John was at home , now Tresaize, Roche, 3 miles away, with Luther & Violet, Harriet away visiting her sister Hannah Liddicoat at Nanpean. John described himself as \"steam engine fitter & fixer, clay works\". Harriet died Jul 1919 and John retired to Townsend House, Chapel Road, Roche, where he died 19 Dec 1928 aged 83, leaving ¬£813 to daughter Violet now Postle,\n\nA quick summary of his children:\n\nHannah/Anna born 7 Oct 1866, married Jacob Grigg in 1889, had 5 daughters and died 1937 in the St Austell area.\n\nTheodore born 14 Jun 1868, married Lucinda Martyn at Treverbyn 6 Feb 1892 and had 2 daughters with her but then he buried all three within a year (Apr 1894-5) and as often happens in this kind of circumstances emigrated to America - he had travelled there on a visit, then rushed back when his wife was ill. In 1903 he went to Canada and married Jeanne Kieffer, had a son Jack before moving to Esmeralda, Nevada, where his wife died in Feb 1908. He and son Jack lived in Nevada until he died in 1928 after an illness of 7 years.\n\nArchibald - see below\n\nTheophilus & Theophila born 1871 & 1874 died aged 1 & 3 respectively, then another Theophilus was born 31 May 1877. He attested to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry in 1895 aged 18 then the following year was transferred to the Royal Navy. As I mentioned above (in father John's section) in 1899 he purchased his discharge and went home to Stenalees. On 7 Feb 1903 at Teverbyn he married Uneta Willcock and they had 3 children. No doubt hid brothers enthused about America and he went out to investigate on 25 Aug 1906. In 1911 Uneta and the children joined him and he was naturalized, giving home address of 25 Fort Washington Avenue, New York City. In 1914 he was drafted to New Jersey for the duration of war, giving occupation as \"Ordering Inspector for Evance Engineering Co.\"(?Evans). Uneta and the children must have returned to UK as in 1916 son Edwin John died there aged 6 and was buried on 16 Dec in Tywardreath. I cannot find anything more of Theophilus after WW1, although a fellow genealogist stated he died in USA.\n\nLuther Best Manhire born 2 Dec 1880 was at home until 1911 census but left a few weeks later for USA, joining his brothers in Duke of Cornwall Light Infantry in WW1 then he popped home in 1917 to marry Bessie Furze and took her back to the States with him. He went harvesting in Canada in 1923, directory in Casper, Wyoming lists him in 1937, and in WW2 attestation he gave nephew Jack in Goldfield as reference and his own employer as Richard Linstadt, Edgerton. I cannot find a death record for him or for Bessie. Oct 2022 update - see below: However, the story is not as simple as all that. Far from \"popping\" back to England to marry, he stayed for several years. He was discharged from the army on 19 Sep 1917 due to sickness and married Bessie Furse on 1 Dec that year. His mother Harriet was evidently unwell and died in 1919, buried on 24 Jul in the Roche churchyard. So the census taken on 19 Jun 1921 shows Luther and Bessie living at Tresaize with her (illegitimate) daughter Florence. Luther listed his employer as English China Clay Co.Ltd, for whom he mined. His father John can be seen boarding in Littlejohn, Roche with a probable ex-colleague, he a retired widower. As I said above, Luther was listed Harvesting in Canada in 1923, so was not in the area when John died on 19 Dec 1928 (at Townsend House, possibly a care home). Luther owned/rented land in Wyoming and appeared in the local directory in 1932 and 1937. He died on 15 Oct 1942 of peritonitis at the Memorial Hospital, Kaycee, Wyoming \"following a lengthy illness\" and was buried in the Highland Cemetery there. He was aged about 63 working as a shepherd for a local farmer. So when he signed up for WW2 6 months before he never saw any service. Although I found his death details, I still cannot locate Bessie, although there was a son of a Bessie Manhire who died in the same area in 1945 but under the surname Hopkins. So she may have remarried and died herself under this name. I have searched, but there are a great many and none fits perfectly.\n\nThis goes to show how a simple census can open up an entire section of somebody's life story and bring in other records to pad out their life, and a reasonably recent snapshot brings to life what may previously have been the bare bones of a tale.\n\nGarnet - see below.\n\nViolet Irene born 15 Oct 1887, baptised 20 Mar 1889 at Treverbyn, went on to marry in Jan 1914 George Owen Postle from Wales, in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry with her brothers 1914-9 giving occupation in \"civvie street\" as brickie.She died Dec 1972 aged 85,\n\nIanthe Best Manhire born 28 Jul 1889 married in Oct 1906 John Henry Hawke but only survived 9 months from the wedding (probably due to childbirth) as she died Jul 1907 aged 18.\n\nSo 1921 census showed John, widowed, at Littlejohns, Roche, boarding with daughter Violet and her little daughter Ianthe Postle, in he household of Thomas Hawkey, CCL. John was a retired engine fitter.\n\n12th May 2023\n\nResearching Gordon Richard Manhire was interesting, to say the least! Previously I had abandoned the search as all I had was towards the end of his life and a big void before, but today I made a discovery - a marriage announcement in a Scottish newspaper leading to much more detail! He was born 29 Jul 1918 in Croydon to Roderick and Edith nee Rhodes. 1921 census showed them at 57 Stratford Road, Thornton Heath, his father a Commercial Traveller, his mother Edith Home Duties, his sister Betty aged 4 and he aged 2. I still cannot find him in 1939 Register but now know that on 9 Aug 1943 in Peterculter, Scotland, he married May Whyte McKilligan Leith. Her excellent middle name was her mother's maiden-name and she was born in 1911 in Boston, Mass, USA to Scottish parents, her father working as a Janitor. They had moved back to Scotland with her when she was 2 (1921 census was no use as it didn't cover Scotland - and of course other records are similarly missing). So after the marriage Gordon and May/Gladys can be seen in the Norwood area, at several addresses. When she became too frail to live on her own, his mother Edith joined them and died there in 1971 at the age of 83. When Gordon retired, he and May moved to Worthing, Sussex and he died there in 1987 aged 69. May lived on there and died there in 2010, aged 99.\n\nHannah Manhire was born 1844 in St Stephens to John and Elizabeth nee Johns (see Felix and Eli) 2nd of their 11. She can be seen aged 7 in census of 1851 at Higher Colevreath with parents, sibs and 2 lodgers, next door to George & Mary Manhire, her grandparents. In 1861 census they can be seen at Hillyvreath, Roche. In Oct 1866 she married Thomas Dally, farm worker from Gorran and they had 7 children (although 2 of these were known by 2 names each - Hart/Arthur and Lot/Thomas - which confused me no end! In censuses of 1871 & 1881 they can be seen at Boswinger, Gorran. Thomas died aged 41 in Feb 1885 and was buried in St Michael's, Caerhayes on 7 Mar 1885. In 1891 census Hannah can be seen living at Caerhayes with 6 children, still there in 1901 but with just one son left at home - Hart, listed as Horseman, she living \"on her own means\" i.e. savings/insurance/pension. By 1911 she was 67 and can be seen in the census back at Tregoss, Roche, living with her \"sister\" Alma & family. She died on 9 Oct 1937 aged 94, living at Brynn, Roche and buried in the council cemetery on 13 Oct.\n\nHetty Manhire was born 23 Apr 1892 in Shaugh Prior to Joseph & Jane nee Brewer and baptised across the way in Lee Moor Methodist chapel (see Alma1 below) on 19 Jun 1892. She can be seen in census of 1901 aged 8 at 1 Blackalder Cottages with parents & sibs then in 1911 census aged 18, working as Housemaid in the household of a widowed Army Major at 26 Western College Road, Plymouth. In Jul 1939, the year after her mother died, she married Samuel Willcocks, 10 years her junior. There is a death record for Samuel in Plymouth in Jul 1991 aged 89. 2019 update: I have found a record dated 13 Apr 1950, stating she died at 5 Dartmoor Cottages, Wotter, Shaugh Prior, leaving effects worth ¬£150 to Samuel, who registered her death at Plympton. 1921 census showed her working at Bransgore, Hampshire as a servant in the household of a Lieutenant Colonel. Samuel was at home with his parents and sibs at Lee Moor, a 19-year-old clay labourer, as were his father and brothers.\n\nHilda May Manhire was born 26 Apr 1901 in Camborne to Edward & Adeline nee Nicholas - see Edward below. She missed the 1901 census by 3 weeks but I know her family were staying with her grandparents at Kieve Mill, Trewithian. On 8-15 Aug 1903 she travelled aged 2 with her mother on the SS St Paul to join her father in Michigan. Her brother Gordon was born in Kellogg, but by 1911they were back in UK, running the 3 Cornish Choughs pub in Treswithian, Hilda aged 10. He remained in charge of the Choughs for many years. As I have said, 1939 Register showed them there, Hilda an ATS Section Leader She was the daughter I mentioned who left her money to Edward, enabling him to retire (he was 72), her home address still the Choughs, in 1952. She died in St Thomas' Hospital, London, where I was born a mere 4 years later. 1921 census showed her boarding in Tiverton, a school teacher aged 20.\n\n11th May 2023\n\nFlorence Winifred Manhire was born 25 Aug 1899 in Bugle to Samuel and Maud nee Martin, i.e. sister of Cecil, see below. She was baptised on 11 Sep 1899 in Treverbyn and can be seen at Bugle in 1901 census aged 2 with parents & sibs, also at Carbis in 1911 at school. 1921 census showed her in Bugle, working as a servant in the household of a solicitor and his widowed father in Newquay. The following year she married Cuthbert Kitchener White, who had been living across the county at 6 Edgcumbe Terrace, St Blazey with his parents, and they can be seen there in 1939 Register, after his parents had died. There are 2 closed files, but I know of no children. Cuthbert was in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry in WW1 and received 2 medals, a builder/mason by profession. When Winifred died 1 Nov 1947, he married widow Elizabeth VA Trethewey nee Marshall. He died Jul 1976 aged 82 and she followed in 1997 aged 87.\n\nGarnet Manhire was born 1 May 1884 in St Stephens to John and Harriet nee Best and was baptised at Treverbyn on 3 Dec 1884. See Archibald below, Garnet was 8th child of 11, so can be seen in 1891 at Bonney with the family. By 1901 census Archibald had gone, so Garnet can be seen at Stenalees, a 16-year-old CCL with parents & sibs. He set off for Canada in Jul 1904 aged 21 as a labourer but returned in the December. In Jul 1909 he married Mabel Best, also from St Stephens and they can be seen in 1911 census at Tresaise, Garnet a \"stationary engineman\". 1921 census showed them there, he still the same, working in a china clay works, she with Home Duties. By 1939 Register, however, he described himself as \"incapacitated\" engine driver. I don't know what transpired but he wrote to the local newspaper in 1919 to say he would have no further responsibility for Mabel's debts, so maybe there was trouble and she had gambling problems. She replied in another newspaper a week later that she had no debts relating to her husband. 1930-31 he published 9 letters/ads regarding treatment for his ulcerated legs, so maybe lived on the proceeds but in 1935 the whole thing happened again and in Dec 1942 he had to sell his house contents & furniture due to \"declining housekeeping\" so there may have still been in difficulties. He died in hospital in Redruth aged 69 in Apr 1954 and she 1963.\n\nJessie's Auntie Gladys Manhire was born on 15 Nov 1888 in Battersea to Richard & Tahpenes nee Knight. She can be seen in 1891 census at 19 Anhalt Road aged 2 with parents, sibs & a boarder, then 1901 with just parents & sibs, then 1911 aged 22 with 3 brothers & a boarder. In Jan 1913 probably at St Mary's church nearby, she married Emile William Minty, solicitor's clerk. He lived at 11 Rosenau Crescent, quite close by and after marriage Gladys moved in with him and his parents. Emile was the product of a marriage between a joiner from Bath and a confectioner's assistant from Paris, working in Bond Street in London, hence the french name. They had 2 children then in 1918 can be seen in a place of their own at 15 Broxash Road, Battersea, near Clapham Common. However, Emile's mother died in 1921 and by 1929 evidently his father couldn't cope and they moved back to 11 Rosenau Crescent. Here they remained and can be seen in 1939 Register. Emile was listed as \"Solicitor's Managing Clerk\", Gladys UDD and daughter Evelyn a 25-year-old Shorthand Typist working for Lever Bros Margarine Manufactory, also \"ARP for the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea and Lever Bros Casualty Branch\". Son Frederick was not there, as he was in the Navy. Gladys died here on 15 Dec 1958, leaving effects worth ¬£432 to Emile and after this he moved in with Evelyn and her husband George in Kingston-upon-Thames and died there in Jul 1969. 1921 census came just after Emile was discharged from the services (he joined RAF in Mar 1917, discharged Apr 1920) and showed them at 15 Broxash Road. Emile was a law clerk employed by a firm in The Strand, Gladys Home Duties and the 2 children at school.\n\n10th May 2023\n\nElizabeth Mary Manhire An Elizabeth Mary was born in Apr 1874, to William & Eliza nee Bennetts, but died on 27 Jun 1875. So in Jan 1878 a new baby was given the name. She was born at 35 Wesley Street, Camborne, appeared in 1881 census with them there aged 3 and moved with the family to 5 Adelaide Street, where she can be seen in the 1891 census, aged 13 & listed as a Tin Miner (?). In 1897 she married local boy Walter John Stoddern (aka Jack). Jack went out to Kellogg, Idaho, to stay with his brother Eddie & work at the Bunker Hill mine. Elizabeth remained at home with their daughter, but by 1911 census Jack was back & working as a coal-carrier at the coal-works. Elizabeth died in 1956 & Jack in 1959, both in Camborne. 2019 update: 1939 Register, where they can be seen at 17 Adelaide Street, with her brother Charles next-door-but-one at number 13. There is a redacted line in their household, no doubt Doreen, who is still alive, as I understand it.\n\nLater: I have just discovered she died in 2014, aged 95. 1921 census showed them in Adelaide Street, Jack a tin miner currently Out of Work, Elizabeth Home Duties, daughter Lilian a 23-year-old factory hand employed by William Bennetts - probably her uncle. There were also in the household baby daughter Doreen and \"adopted daughter Roslin\" - they had taken on Jack's niece Rosalind when his brother Albert died. Incidentally, I can now see Doreen is the third person in 1939 Register, with the added information that she worked in an explosives factory and that she went on to marry an Ivor Albert Taylor. I see this was in 1944 and she died in 2014. I understand that they had 3 children.\n\nElsie Manhire was born 16 Dec 1880 at Meleador Downs to David & Ellen nee Lukes and christened 4 Jan 1881 at St Stephens. She can be seen on census of 1881 aged 3 months at Meleador with mother. stepfather & sibs. She started school at St Stephen-in-Brannel on 7 Jun 1886 and the next census found her still there with parents and brother in 1891, aged 11. I cannot find her in 1901 census but in 1911 she can be seen in Newquay, working as a general servant for a retired farmer & family. On 31 Oct 1914 in St Columb Minor she married John Herbert Milford, Newquay fisherman, son of deceased solicitor. In 1911 he can be seen at 2 Kimberley Terrace, Newquay, listed as a housepainter unemployed - evidently why he took up fishing - with his widowed mother. In 1939 he and Elsie can be seen a few streets away at 10 Capel Hill, Newquay, John describing himself as \"Caretaker seeking Work\" and they still lived there when John died on 7 May 1950 aged 75, leaving effects worth ¬£108 to Elsie. She must have moved the 20 miles back to St Austell area, where her family was, as this was where she died in 1969 aged 89. 1921 census showed Elsie and John at 7 Fore Street, Newquay, John \"house painter Out of Work\" and Elsie with Home Duties.\n\nEthel Annie Manhire was Oliver's first cousin, born 26 Jan 1881 at Molinnis, Bugle to Thomas and Hannah nee Yelland and christened on 26 May 1881 aged 4 months at St Austell Primitive Methodist Church at Bugle. She can be seen at Molinnis with parents and sibs in censuses of 1881-1911 but didn't quite make it to 1939. She never married and all I can find are 2 probate documents relating to her death. She died 17 Sep 1935 at Molinnis, leaving effects worth ¬£221 to brother Wilson and land to him and their sister Lona. Wilson had a headstone made for her in Treverbyn cemetery and then joined her there 7 years later. 1921 census showed them, he a music teacher, she Housekeeper, both working at home, Molinnis.\n\nFelix Manhire was born Jul 1864 to John and Elizabeth nee Johns and apparently registered as \"Felic Menhire\" at St Stephens and appeared on 1871 census as \"Felix Mankin\" aged 4 (really 6)The family were living at a claypit called America - one of many in the area. In 1881 census they were at a neighbouring pit Whitemoor with 2 lodgers both CCLs (china clay labourers), presumably working with John and now Felix too. In Jul 1889 in the St Austell area he married Annie Bullock and they sailed straight out to New York on the SS Arizona. Son Lot was born in Montana in 1890 and Felix can be seen in the local directory listed as Anaconda Power House Worker, living at 11 Kempland Avenue, Carroll, Butte, Montana. This was the time when the Rothschild family bought up most of the copper mines and the life went out of the area. In 1891 census Annie and Lot can be seen living with her widowed mother Jane at Hill Head, St Stephens. She must have been pregnant as she lost a newborn daughter in the summer of that year. Felix returned in Jul 1893 and next son was born Apr 1864 in Nanpean. So by 1901 census they had 3 sons and can be seen with them at Carbis, Roche, where they remained. In 1911 they had 7 children, Felix working as a Stationary Engine Driver at the Clay Works, as did Lot. Ambrose and Eli were labourers. Electoral roll records show Felix at Carbis until his death aged 65. He apparently died at Goss Moor, although home address was Goonleigh, Carbis (not far away). HE was buried 8 #jul 1930 in Roche cemetery, leaving effects worth ¬£140 to Annie. She then went to live with her daughter in Newquay and died there in Feb 1959 aged 82. NB they had 12 children in all, 5 passing in infancy. 1921 census showed Felix and Annie in Carbis - see Eli yesterday.\n\n9th May 2023\n\nEdward Manhire was Charles' brother - see yesterday -born on 4 Sep 1880 to William & Eliza nee Bennetts at 35 Wesley Street, Camborne, and can be seen in the 1881 census there at the age of 6 months. By 1891, they had moved round to 5 Adelaide Street and he is seen there aged 10. In Oct 1900 he married Adeline nee Nicholas, who had married his elder brother William in 1896 at the age of 17, but he had died in 1899 after losing a son William Lambert Manhire aged 6 months, and she turned to his brother. In 1901 they can be seen living with her parents & 4 siblings - on the family homestead, Kieve Mill, Edward listed as a tin-miner. This must have been a temporary arrangement, though, as he was the brother referred to as E Manhire, who first went out to USA. In 1902 Adeline had a son & named him Edward, only for him to die the next day, and in 1903 Edward is calling for her to join him in Michigan and she travelled with 2-year-old daughter Hilda in Aug 1903. A further child, Gordon, was born in Kellogg in 1908, so they must have joined the others in the mining community. It must have been very bleak and tough, and by 1911 they are back in England, happily settled in Treswithian, Camborne, running the Three Cornish Choughs Pub. He ran this establishment for the next 40 years, until retiring in 1952, possibly funded by a legacy from their unmarried daughter who died in St Thomas' Hospital, London on 28 May 1952, leaving ¬£1674 12s 2d to her father. He died himself in Dec 1968 aged 88 and is buried in Penponds Cemetery. 2017 update: he left on board SS Philadelphia on 27 Sep 1902 (they lost baby Edward in the June). 1939 Register finds them at The Cornish Choughs, Trewithian, Camborne, as expected, Edward Licensed Victualler, Adeline UDD and daughter Hilda ATS Section Leader (she went to USA with them as a child but returned with them too and was the daughter who died in London in 1952, leaving money to her father). Adeline died 11 Oct 1949, at the pub, leaving ¬£435 of her own money and was buried in Penponds Churchyard with the rest of her family (she was one of 12 children). My favourite detail was the wreath \"To my dear little wife from Eddie\". He died on Christmas Day 1968 and joined his \"little Wife\" and her family in the plot mentioned above. 2019 update: he left ¬£10,604 on his death (worth ¬£184k in 2019). 1921 census showed him at the pub, \"hotel proprietor\" with Adeline and 13-year-old son Gordon\n\nAnother I have missed was Eli Manhire, Oliver's second cousin (their grandfathers were brothers), son of Felix, brother of Ambrose - see below. He was born on Christmas Day 1896 in Carbis and can be seen there in 1901 and 1911 with parents and sibs, in the latter 14-year-old labourer. On 11 Feb 1916 he enlisted in Royal Marines and served for 3 years. Then in Apr 1921 he married Ella Chapman, so can be seen newly-married in the census, staying with his parents and sibs at Carbis. He was, as were his father and brothers, employed by the Carbis China Clay Brick & Tile Co. Eli & Ella lived in Charles Street to 1925, then Rosevear Road to 1928, then 20 Polkyth Road to 1931 at least. 1939 Register showed them at 63 Tremaine Place, Eli a wood machinist, Ella UDD and Francis Eddy, 22-year-old bricklayer. (All of these addresses are in the St Austell area). Unfortunately they had no children and the next we hear in 1946 when Eli died aged 49. Ella remarried in 1958 and died 1983 aged 83.\n\nElizabeth Jane Manhire1 was born Apr 1866 in St Austell to Thomas & Hannah n√©e Yelland and christened at home at Goonbarrow, St Austell by the St Columb Bible Christian Circuit. She can be seen aged 4 at Netley with parents & brothers in 1871 census. By 1881 the family had moved around to Molinnis (just half a mile away, beyond Bugle station).When in Sep 1890 she married John Warne, they lived next door to her parents and had their 6 children there. They gave them lovely imaginative names; Claudia Olive, Hedley Ewart, Llewellyn Vernon, Gladys, Evelyn Hyacinth & Silvanus! in 1939 Register both she and John were living on Clann Farm, Lanivet, where John helped with the horses belonging to his son-in-law William Allen & daughter Gladys (4 miles from Molinnis). I have found a death for John, 8 Oct 1952 in the Bodmin area. He left effects worth ¬£381 to Gladys and was living at Little Trehudreth, Blisland. 1921 census showed them at Little Rosemellyn, Roche, John a quarryman, Gladys and Elizabeth Household Duties. One of the boarders was the aforementioned William Allen, who later married Gladys, oddly described as a \"Regreater\". As he became a farmer, I have no idea what this was supposed to be!\n\nThere was another by this name, Elizabeth Jane Manhire2, I suppose. She was born 8 Jul 1911 in Lanner, Gwennap, Redruth to William John and Boadicea nee Martin and can be seen there in 1921 census aged 10 with parents, brother and sister. On 7 Aug 1939 she married William Henry Chapman at Lanner. As 1939 Register was taken in September that year it caught them just after marriage and they can be seen at 44 Tortellins Road, Devonport, he a sailmaker employed at the Royal Naval Dockyard, she UDD of course. She died in Mar 1984 in Plymouth, he 1992.\n\n8th May 2023\n\nI don't seem to have featured Cecil Redvers Manhire, Oliver's second-cousin-once-removed (they had great grandfather George b1786 in common) but he is interesting, so will now. He was born 24 Feb 1900 in St Austell to Samuel and Maud nee Newton, 2nd of 5. He can be seen in census of 1901 in Bugle with parents & sibs, then 1911 at Carbis, aged 11 and at school. On 7 Apr 1919 in Devonport he joined the Navy and served 22 years. In Oct 1926 he took some leave to get married - to Euneta Richards (also from Roche, known as Neta), but they had no children. 1921 census showed him one of very many naval servicemen aboard the battleship HMS Warspite (1915-1945), stationed at Devonport Dockyard. Euneta was at that time working in Canada as a housemaid. By 1939 Register she can be seen in Roche, with a Frances Burridge, who the following year married her brother Austen. I can't find Cecil in the Register, as he was on HMS Dolphin, which was sunk that year, but he seems to have survived. I have seen reports of a motorcycle accident he had in 1928, involving a stay in hospital, but he retired in 1943 with several medals and in 1958 was elected onto the local council. When he died aged 71 on 28 Nov 1971 he was cremated at Penmount. Euneta followed in 1998 aged 95\n\nCharles Manhire was born 18 Dec 1890 and died Jan 1964, both in Camborne. He can be seen at home with his parents William & Eliza & sibs in census returns of 1891 (aged 3 months), 1901 & 1911, all at 5 Adelaide Street. In the latter he is aged 20 & working as a sawyer in a saw-mill. I have no idea why he didn't go to The States with his brothers. 2017 update: I can now add the 1939 Register to his records; he can be seen at 13 Adelaide Street, 4 houses from where he grew up, he was alone and listed as \"Under Steward British Legion Club\", which sounds like fun! He may well have remained here until his death, as he died locally, in Camborne Jan 1964 aged 73. 1921 census showed him as expected at Adelaide Street with parents & siblings (also an adopted brother I knew nothing about- obviously 13 wasn't enough children!) Charles was again described as a sawyer. When he died on 17 Feb 1964 he was buried in St Martin & St Meriadoc churchyard.\n\nJessie's uncle Claude Manhire was born 12 Aug 1879 in Bugle, St Austell, to Richard & Tahpenes Knight and was on the census return of 1881 with the family there aged 1. By 1891 they have upped sticks & moved to London (which is why Clive's family come from there). He is aged 11 in 1891 living in Battersea with parents & sibs, but by 1901 he is found in Hong Kong in the Royal Navy. A couple of years ago, I sent for his service records and have a long list of ships he served on between 1897 and 1919. When he was 18 he signed up for 12 years service and 21 sailings are listed, totally consecutive, so he must have been at sea for 14 years! His character was described as Very Good always, although he was always an Able Seaman, never getting \"promotion\". On 14 August 1909 he joined the RFR (Royal Fleet Reserve) in Chatham, and was working as a labourer in a flour-mill, living at home, as can be seen on the 1911 census. At the outbreak of war he was called up again & served on 6 more ships until Feb 1919, when he was paid off and left. He was awarded 3 medals: Star, Victory & British War Medal. There is a marriage under this name, in Hackney, to a Grace Jones then nothing until his death in Jan 1941 aged 61 in Surrey. 2017 update: in 1939 he was listed as Postman, she UDD and she had a daughter from her first marriage, also Grace Jones, a 30-year-old Sweet Packer. They lived at 6 Denmark Grove, Islington. I can see from Electoral Roll records that he had lived there from 1919, when demobbed from the Navy. However, when he died just 2 years later in Jan 1941, his death was registered in Surrey Mid-Eastern region, which is the area including Sutton, so maybe he was staying with family or in a hospital etc. I still cannot track down Grace's death, although I can see her at the Islington address above until 1950, with daughter Grace, and then Grace junior was married from Islington in 1957. 2019 update: he did in fact marry Grace Jones nee Underwood on 2 Jan 1916, despite it being wartime and he was serving aboard SS Campania as AB2. He was no doubt given leave as the ship was undergoing modifications in dock between Nov 1915 and Apr 1916 for service as an aircraft carrier. He died in St Ebbas Hospital, Epsom, which was at that time a specialist unit for epilepsy patients (later became a mental hospital under the NHS) and was buried at the Finchley Burial Ground (Islington Borough Council) on 26 Mar 1941. On 1 Oct 1964 Grace was cremated in Islington and her ashes buried with Claude. 1921 census showed them at 6 Denmark Grove, as expected, he a 41-year-old Postman employed by the Post Office. They had 3 children; 2 from her previous marriage at school, one Reginald aged 1y9m. Also his father-in-law George Underwood, a 70-year-old retired stoker.\n\nDorothy Manhire (Jessie's 1st cousin) was born 20 Aug 1912 in St Austell, probably in Bugle, to Jasper & Lilian. In Jul 1938 she was married to the wonderfully-named Grenville Joseph Bunney, son of a Police Constable in Penryn. They can be seen the following year on the 1939 Register at Tehidy Road, Tywardreath. Grenville was a Mason and Dorothy UDD. I am pretty sure they had no children, Dorothy died in Jan 1983 aged 70 and Grenville in Apr 1997. 1921 census showed her aged 8 at Bilberry, Bugle with mother and 2 brothers, at school. Her mother Lilian was a dressmaker working from Home, her father had died the year before.\n\nEdgar Manhire, one of Dorothy's brothers, was born Oct 1910 at Bilberry, Bugle. He can be seen there in census of 1911 aged 6 months, with parents & brother Kenneth. Then in 1939 with mother (father died 1920), at the cottage called Kengarthy, working as a builder's labourer. In Jan 1970 at St Austell he married Alice Baudet and they disappear from the records. 2019 update: Searching for his wife Alice, I found an Alice Jeanne Baudet nee Derrien from St Helier, Jersey. She was married before, to Louis Joseph Baudet, and had a son with him by the name of Ronald. Both Louis & Ronald are buried in St Peter, Jersey. Also I have found a burial record for her there, under the name of Manhire, the problem being that I had a year of birth for her as 1901 and it seems to be a typo for 1911. This makes more sense, as she was a similar age to Edgar. Edgar was also buried there, he died on 9 Aug 1988. Alice died in 2004, Ronald in 2015. So 1921 census was as Dorothy above.\n\n7th May 2023\n\nAlma Manhire1 (Jessie's second-cousin - their grandparents were siblings) was born 14 Jul 1897 at Shaugh Prior, Devon (registered Plympton) to Joseph & Jane n√©e Brewer and christened at the Methodist Chapel on 14 Nov 1897. She can be seen at Shaugh Prior with her parents & sibs in 1901 census, then mother & brother Joseph in 1911 as her father died a few weeks before that census was taken. These cottages were miners' houses and had been known as Hillside Cottages as they were on the side of the only hill in a wide flat plain, but by 1900 the two terraces had been renamed Blackalder & Saltram Terraces. In Jan 1923 at the Methodist Chapel - which was just across the field in front of the cottages - she married Harold Samuel Nicholson. Harold worked with China Clay, in the Brick Works. In 1939 Register they can be seen at 5 Blackalder Cottages with son Stewart aged 10 and Alma's sister Hetty and her husband Harold Willcock (also a China Clay Labourer). Harold Nicholson had served in the navy in WW1 at the Vivid II (shore-based barracks at Devonport) & then HMS Ajax 1915-19 as Stoker 2nd Class, then 1st Class and he died aged 94 in Oct 1990. As far as I can see they only had one son Stewart and Alma died in Oct 1991 also aged 94. 1921 census showed her a couple of years before marriage, at Shaugh Prior with her widowed mother and 5 boarders. Jane called herself Postmistress and ran the cottages as post office and presumably boarding-house too. All the boarders were in 20s and 30s and were employed by clay works in various ways. Alma looked after the house. Jane died just before the Register, but I have examined the cottages and cannot see that anyone took over the post-office duties. Nowadays of course there are much fewer about, so I wasn't surprised to find the post goes to another village - in fact there seems to be only one postbox, set in a wall.\n\nAlma Manhire 2 was born Jan 1859 in Roche to John & Elizabeth nee Johns. I can see her in censuses of 1861 with parents & sibs at Hillyvreath, Roche and St Stephen-in-Brannel respectively. On 5 Sep 1880 oddly in Kensal Green, London she married Thomas Richards from Madron. They gave an address in Southam Street, but they soon returned to Cornwall. In 1881 census they were just married and shown living with her parents in St Stephens. Tom was a china-clay labourer and may well have worked with her brother Felix (he had worked as a bricklayer in London, an end-product of clay-production). They were not in UK for 1891 census because they travelled across to USA that year and can be seen in Michigan in 1900 census there. Both her parents died in 1897 & 1899 and they went home in 1900, returning to USA with her sister Ellen to work with them as a servant. It may have been the deaths of her brothers Samuel and George which brought them back to England in 1902, and they can be seen back in Roche in 1911 census, Tom back to mining clay (he had mined iron in Michigan). He died aged 56 in 1916 and Alma 1924 aged 65. Tom was buried in an unconsecrated plot in Nanpean Cemetery, Alma in Roche, giving home address as Enniscaven, St Dennis. 1921 census showed them there, and as Tom was still alive, albeit retired, I had to discount the death record I had. I think the burial in 1948 aged 88 may be the one, in which case he was widowed for 26 years, some of which may have been spent in Bodmin Mental Hospital (including 1939 Register).\n\nAmbrose Manhire was born 23 May 1894 in Nanpean to Felix and Annie nee Bullock, 4th of 12 births, although 4 died in infancy. He can be seen in 1901 & 1911 censuses at Carbis, Roche with parents and sibs, in the latter a 16-year-old labourer. In WW1 he was in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and earned 2 medals. He was obviously a forthright character as he appeared in a newspaper in 1912 when he was 18, summoning a neighbour Frederick Wilton for assault when he had been accusing local children of fighting and Frederick attacked him. Frederick was found guilty and fined, but this may have been why Ambrose moved to Swindon after returning from the war, rather than Cornwall. It was here that in 1920 he married Dorothy Wakefield and 1921 census showed them there at 16 Turner Street, with Dorothy's parents and baby Roderick. Ambrose and his father-in-law Albert both worked for a builder in Swindon, Albert as a carpenter, Ambrose as bricklayer. Both wives had Home Duties. They had another son Ashley 10 years later and 1939 Register has a closed line between these two, so suggests another child, Brian fits the bill, born 1924 in Swindon and he may be still alive.\n\nAnnie Jane Manhire There had been a baby called Annie born to William and Eliza nee Bennetts in Jul 1883 but unfortunately she died aged 6 months and, as was the custom at this time, the name was recycled and used again in 1888, this time with the addition of a middle name. She was born 28 Aug 1888 at 5 Adelaide Street, Camborne, Cornwall, but she left these shores for USA to marry fellow cornishman Ernest William Cecil White, who paid her passage from Southampton on the \"Majestic\" 4-10 Jul 1923, to settle in Michigan. They were soon married, but after 10 years she returned to these shores, and Ernest died 4 years later in Utah. She lived in Camborne for the rest of her life and died there in 1978. 2017 update: They settled in Michigan, but looks like they had no luck with children. Only one birth is registered, Janett born Jul 1928 but died 6 months later of a heart condition. The 1930 census showed they had moved to Detroit and Ernest was working as an inspector in the car factory. Evidently Annie was unhappy and returned to England in 1933, then Ernest died 1937, so she can be seen in 1939 Register as a widow, living at 3 Carclew View, Truro, working as Housekeeper to a Marine Engineer. She died 12 Mar 1978 in Camborne aged 89. I know she didn't come home until 1923 so wasn't on the 1921 census, but have studied her again as her story is interesting. And also very similar to that of our next chap:\n\nArchibald Manhire was born 6 Oct 1869 in St Stephen to John and Harriet nee Best, 3rd of their 10 (although 3 died in infancy). He can be seen in 1871 at Higher Colevreath, 1881 Hensbarrow, then Bonney all in the St Austell area, with parents & siblings, in the latter aged 21 a clay labourer. In 1897 in St Austell he married Rosina Barber and 3 years later they emigrated to USA with 3 little children. But although they were away for 1901 census, they soon returned and had 3 more children in Cornwall. In 1911 they were at Shilton, Stenalees, Ambrose an \"engine man\". 1921 census showed them at the same address with the 5 boys, Archibald an engine driver at a clay works, 4 sons labourers for clay companies and the youngest at school. Unfortunately Archibald met a dramatic end the following year, in a mine accident; a classic collapse of the area he was working on, breaking his spine. He was rescued and transported to hospital but died several days later, aged 52. So in 1939 Register, Rose was alone, a widow with one son remaining Joseph John. She died in 1959 aged 85\n\n6th May 2023\n\nWilliam James Leslie Bevill Knight (known generally as Leslie) was born 6 Feb 1896 in Lanlivery to Woodman & Elizabeth n√©e Ashton. He can be seen in 1901 census at Penpell, Lanlivery with parents, sibs & a servant, then moved with them to Kent, as he is next seen in Hadlow, Tonbridge with parents & sibs in 1911. In 1929 in Eastbourne, Sussex he married Marjorie Grace Bullock, born in the Croydon area, living in Staplehurst. As far as I can see they had just one daughter Shirley, born in 1931. The 1939 Register shows the three of them at a house called Allegheny, Common Lane, Ditchling, nr Chailey, Sussex. In 1939 Leslie was working as a \"Miller's Representative\". Marjorie was UDD, and Shirley's file is closed, as she may still be alive. I suspect she married John Gillam in Tonbridge, but can't tell without sight of the certificate. I suspect Leslie and Marjorie retired some 30 miles to the east as Leslie died in Hailsham in 1971 (aged 75) and Marjorie in Lewes in 1978 (aged 80). 1921 census showed him at Roughway, Plaxtol with mother and siblings - see Reginald, Hilda, Kate below - assisting mother on the farm.\n\nYvonne Eugenie Marjorie Knight was born 18 Sep 1900 at Penpell to Woodman & Elizabeth n√©e Ashton. The final child, she appeared to have received all the names left over from the previous 10! She can be seen in census of 1901 (as Marjorie) at Penpell with parents, sibs & a farm labourer/servant then in 1911 (also as Marjorie) in Hadlow, Tonbridge with parents & sibs. On 20 Apr 1921 at St Dunstan's she married Frank Sidney Pritchard, local boy, who can be seen in 1911 census living with his uncle in High Street, Hadlow. Both were clerks at Kenwood & Court's Close Brewery located in this road. Yvonne & Frank settled in Sevenoaks for a few years and had 2 sons there, although the second, Philip, only lived for one day (at the Foye Nursing Home, Pembroke Road) and by the time the third child Christopher was born in 1929 they had moved to Tonbridge. Frank was by then Manager of an Insurance Brokers. Yvonne was UDD, son Guy at school and one closed record - probably Christopher as he died in 2007 and this information has probably not filtered through yet. On 1 Aug 1977 Yvonne died in the Westminster area of London, giving home address of 22 Stack House, Ebury Street. When Frank died 4 years later aged 87 he gave the same home address but his death was registered in Canterbury (just to confuse matters!) 1921 census showed them a few weeks after marriage, Frank an insurance broker & employer, Yvonne school teacher in Sevenoaks. Their address is interesting - called \"Wilderness Farm, Seal\" I knew of the Wildernesse, as I grew up in Kent, but it requires a little explanation: It is a large estate dating from at least 1327, when this part of the Wealden forest was cleared. It changed hands many times over the centuries and was developed in living memory into a country club, golf club and residential estate.\n\nZerua Rosina Knight was so mis-spelled! born 18 Nov 1854 at Molinnis, St Austell. She can be seen on the census of 1861 staying with her grandparents & uncles (as Arusena/Frusena), then in 1871 at Molinnis with parents & 4 of her 9 sibs (as Vernah - but then her baby sister Oretta is recorded as Horatio!). She married John Bennetts 31st Jan 1877 at the local church in Treverbyn & they had 12 children in the next 22 years. They can be seen in censuses 1881 at Ruddle Moor (as Serniah) with 4 children, 1891 at Higher Blowing House, St Austell (as Zerwiah - nearly!) with 8 children & her brother Alec, then 1901 & 1911 at Bojea Cottage, St Austell, where she remained for some years. John died in 1925 and Zerua in Oct 1930 (as Zerniah R). Her gravestone reads: \"In Loving Memory of John beloved husband of Zeruah Bennetts who died at Bojea on December 25th 1925 (!) aged 71 years... Also Zeruah Roseina wife of the above who died November 2nd 1930 aged 75\". 1921 census showed them at Bojea with 3 \"children\", John a 66-year-old clay labourer and Zerua (as Zeruiah) Home Duties. Son Frank 32 and Roger 27 were also clay labourers (all employed by different companies) and daughter Amelia 21 helping mother At Home.\n\n5th May 2023\n\nRobert Knight4, Oliver's uncle, was born in Apr 1856 to Robert & Lavinia (3rd of 11) and as he never married, he was with his parents all his life, except 1871 census, when he was 15 and possibly in service somewhere (but I can't find him) and in 1911, when he was boarding in Springfield with Charles & Eva Simcock after his parents' deaths. He died aged 75 at Rosevear Road, Bugle and was buried in Treverbyn churchyard 31 Jan 1932. 1921 census showed him still there with the Sincocks, aged 65 and retired.\n\nSarah Ann Knight was born Jul 1863 at Tresibble, Roche to James & Rose n√©e Common and christened at Roche church on 8 Nov 1863. She can be seen in censuses of 1871 aged 7 at Hallew with parents & brother, then 1881 aged 17 with parents at Rosemelling. On 28 Feb 1885 in Roche she married Woodman Pascoe and they had 8 children. In 1891 census they can be seen at Higher Woon, Roche with 3 children & her parents, then in 1901 & 1911 at Paradise Farm, Bugle. They both died there, Woodman in 1932 and Sarah in 1938, leaving effects worth ¬£55 to Woodman junior, clay labourer. 2019 update: Sarah Ann died 23 Jan 1938 and joined her husband in the grave at Roche, where he had been for 6 years. 1921 census showed them at Woon, Bugle, Roche with 4 children, Woodman a clay miner working in Bunny, one son Harry \"unable to work\", two Woodman 21 & Silas 19, clay labourers Out of Work.\n\nSusan Knight b Jul 1871 to Christopher & Jane nee Roberts. She married Charles Hancock in Jan 1898 in Roche & they lived next door to her parents. They can be seen there in 1891, then 1901 census returns, at Criggan, Roche, before moving to Parkwoon by 1911. She died in Jan 1934, aged 62, after which he remarried - in Oct 1938 to Victoria Maud Tregaskis. 2017 update: Charles can be seen in 1939 Register with Victoria, her mother and possibly her sister, at Central Corner, Roche. He ran the shop, now a Co-op. After his death there in 1955, effects worth ¬£2114 went to his wife Victoria, who was 30 years younger than him, and she remarried. 1921 census showed them alone at Reeshill, Colevreath, Roche, Charles a farmer, Susan Home Duties. This suggests he only took on the shop at his second marriage (she was a sweet packer aged 16 with her parents in Plymouth in 1921)\n\nVery many twigs on this tree died before 1921, or had emigrated, so were not included.\n\nWilliam Knight 10 was born Jul 1861 at St Stephen-in-Brannel to John & Amy n√©e Rowe and can be seen in census of 1871 aged 9 at Bloomdale, St Stephens. After this I lose him, although it may be him at Housey Farm in 1881, a \"Farm Servant Indoor\" aged 20. 2019 update: 11 Feb 1811 he married Ann Elizabeth Wass nee Boyce, born in Suffolk,12 years older than William. She was only married to John Wass for 4 years before he died aged 25 of smallpox, then 4 months later Ann lost her little daughter Kezia before she was even 2 years old, probably of the same condition. She married William 9 years later in her home town of Staveleys, Derbyshire and can be seen with him in 1881 census as a farm labourer in Chesterfield, Eckington 1891 & 1901 as horsekeeper at a colliery, along with 2 lodgers. In 1911 he was working for the railway as platelayer and they had moved to Whittington Moor (about 6 miles southwest). They may have remained there for the rest of his life, as his death was registered there in Newbold in 1923, then Ann's death was registered back in Chesterfield. 1921 census showed them at the same address as 1911; 14 Albert Street, Whittington Moor, Chesterfield, William a \"ganger platelayer\" employed by Sheepbridge Coal & Iron Co., Ann Home Duties.\n\nWilliam James Knight was born Oct 1899 in Lanivet to Ernest & Gertrude n√©e Rowse. He can be seen in 1901 & 1911 censuses at Rosewarrick with parents, brother & grandmother in the former. In Dec 1924 he married Annie Wills, whose sister Amy was to marry his brother Ernest in Apr 1926. They had one daughter Maud and can be seen with her in 1939 Register at Woodley, Wadebridge, where William was farmer, and Maud was at school. Annie died in 1976 and William 29 Jul 1978, both aged 78. Maud married Cecil Harris in 1952 & died in 1964 aged 36. 2019 update: I see from his probate that he died at Higher Woodley, Lanivet, where he had been in 1939 Register. He left ¬£19,365 but it is too recent to state to whom, but was probably his daughter Maud. 1921 census showed him 3 years before marriage in Lanivet with parents and brother - see Ernest Alfred 30th Apr below - aged 21, a general farm worker assisting his father.\n\n4th May 2023\n\nMuriel Ellen Knight was born Jan 1904 in Dulwich, Surrey to Alexander Adolphus & Ellen n√©e Blackwell and christened there on 7 Feb 1904. She can be seen in census of 1911 at 6 Milestone Road, Upper Norwood with parents and cousin Eva Jarrett. [Right by Crystal Palace Park] In Jul 1940 she married a man called Paine. 2019 update: she married Leslie Leeds Paine in Jul 1940 in Surrey, where I have found him living with his mother in 1939 electoral roll in Wracclesham, Farnham, Surrey. Likewise they (Muriel & Leslie) can be seen in 1953 & 1955 at Barry Cottage, Bat & Ball Lane, Farnham. When he died in 1986 he was buried in St Peter's Cemetery, Wracclesham and Muriel moved 60 miles, across to West Oxfordshire, and died 3 years later. 1921 census showed her aged 7 at 6 Milestone Road with her parents - see Alexander on 26th Apr below.\n\nPaul Knight born October quarter in Lanivet to James & Emmeline nee Cook can be seen in the census returns of 1861, 1871 & 1881 with his parents & sibs on the farm at Higher Rosewarrick, Lanivet. He married local girl Fanny Jane Allen in October 1883 at Lanivet. They settled at Tretoil Farm, having a total of five children and can be seen there in 1901 and 1911. When Paul died here in 1923 he left ¬£100 to his widow Fanny and son George (3rd son inherited as eldest son John had emigrated to USA and 2nd son had died 3 years previously). 1921 census showed him not long before his death, at Bilberry, Bugle with Fanny and George, also daughter Olive. George was a Clay Labourer Out of Work and Olive Home Duties. (Daughter Prudence was at this time in service in Hampstead, London but came home when Paul died in early 1923).\n\nPercy Kingdon Knight - was born 4 Feb 1907 in Roche to John & Louisa n√©e Kingdon, an only child. He can be seen in 1911 census aged 4 at South Moor, Whitstone, North Cornwall with parents & Kingdon grandparents. He never married and 1939 Register shows him aged 32 at the same farm (so he evidently inherited it from his grandparents) with his widowed mother and housekeeper Mary Hatch. I was very pleased to see he was known by his unusual middle name. He still lived there when he died on 25 Nov 1989 and left ¬£141,835. 1921 census showed him aged 14 at West Moor, Whitstone with parents, paternal grandmother (aged 80) and 2 servants. See John Roberts Knight below.\n\nRegi"
