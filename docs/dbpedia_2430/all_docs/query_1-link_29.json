        "text": "§ Mr. Crookshank\n\nHon. and Socialist Members—is that it? It is quite clear to whom I refer. They then appeared to constitute the Opposition and were bent on prolonging proceedings to a very late hour, or perhaps I should say a very early hour, on the Isle of Man (Customs) Bill, a Measure which has been regarded as uncontentious—if not, indeed, formal. The result of the Division was 105 to 20. The remainder of that Bill—we got only Clause 1—as well as other necessary Government business, is, therefore down for today, in addition—\n\n§ Mr. Crookshank\n\n—of some hon. Members opposite to delay Government business and to keep a necessarily large number of Government supporters sitting up until the small hours. Hon. Members have their duties to perform, but undue debate on matters which are usually treated as formal or uncontentious must lead, particularly at this very late period of the Session, to a situation which affects every hon. Member of this House.\n\nHer Majesty's Government have been examining means by which the business can be completed and the House rise before August Bank Holiday; which, I am sure, is desired by the great majority of the House and could be done without the Opposition sacrificing any of their undoubted rights of debate. We shall this evening get as far as we can with the business before us, but what we have not completed by a reasonable hour will have to be postponed to another day, with the inevitable result that the House may have to sit on August Bank Holiday—[HON. MEMBERS: \"Oh.\"]—and perhaps beyond.\n\nThis is simply a plain statement of cause and effect. The discussions which are taking place between my right hon. Friend, the Government Chief Whip, and the right hon. Gentleman, the Opposition Chief Whip, could mean a very satisfactory arrangement. Unfortunately, the actions of some hon. Members opposite do not seem to bear any relation to the intentions and labours of the usual channels, whose co-operation is essential to the dignity and smooth working of the House.\n\n§ Mr. Attlee\n\nIs the right hon. Gentleman aware that from an inquiry I have made I gather that the whole matter could have been settled had it been properly handled by those in charge on the Treasury Bench? Is he also aware that a business statement has seldom, in my recollection, been used for making a partisan attack of this kind in entirely unbecoming terms? May I also ask him whether he recalls the numerous occasions during the last six and a half years 536 on which five or six Members on the other side kept the House night after night?\n\n§ Mr. Bing\n\nWould the right hon. Gentleman give an undertaking to attend tonight's debate on the Isle of Man (Customs) Bill? In which case he will have an opportunity of knowing that the difficulty which arose last night was due to his hon. Friend failing to have entered the accounts of the Isle of Man upon which the Bill was based, and failing to have available the Resolutions of the Tynwald upon which, it was said, the matter was based? Will he, therefore, see that before we consider the matter tonight there will be available in the Library the statement of the funds of the Isle of Man upon which the Bill is based—the accounts upon which these taxes are said to be based—and the Resolutions of the Tynwald by which, it is said, the Government are bound?\n\n§ Sir H. Williams\n\nIs my right hon. Friend aware that the Leader of the Opposition is totally unfamiliar with what happened last night? [HON. MEMBERS: \"So are you.\"] No. In regard to the 538 allegation about prolonging proceedings in the last Parliament on Prayers, that happened on only one occasion. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Oh.\"] It happened on only one occasion, and on that occasion the proceedings were prolonged entirely due to the fact that no hon. Member on our side was permitted to make a speech unobstructed for more than two minutes at a time because of the opposition created by disorderly hon. Members opposite.\n\n§ Mr. Ede\n\nAs the right hon. Gentleman alluded to me I hope the House will allow me to make a personal statement. I sat, as is my custom, in the Chamber during the greater part of the evening—I think continuously from 10 o'clock onwards. I took no part in the discussion until the right hon. Gentleman came in and moved to report Progress and in the course of his remarks alluded to me. I do not know what he means by the allusion he has made to me today.\n\n§ Mr. Crookshank\n\nI am sorry if I have offended the right hon. Gentleman, but, of course, he was here, and, he being the most senior Member of the Opposition then present, I naturally assumed that he was in charge of the Opposition's affairs. If I ascribed to him an honour which he was not then enjoying, I am sorry. I again repeat that there is no relationship whatsoever between the flow of the debate yesterday and what may have happened in the previous Parliament. I again say that Prayers were then initiated by Private Members. I admit that there was an occasion on which there was extended debate on the Finance Bill. It resulted in extra time being given by the Government. This year the official Opposition had no need to do anything of that sort, because we conceded the time before it ever started.\n\n§ Lieut.-Colonel Lipton\n\nThe statement that we heard a few moment ago from the Leader of the House seemed to indicate that there is not now quite the same urgency in getting Government business disposed of that we had thought. It now appears that, after all, the House will have to sit on August Bank Holiday, a decision with which I have no quarrel and with which most of my hon. Friends on this side of the House have no quarrel This decision does help, however, to destroy the validity of the argument of urgency that has been advanced on more than one occasion by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite.\n\nI am not going to attempt the impossible task of teaching the Leader of the House manners or of how to conduct himself as the Leader of the House, but I urge upon the House that there is now no case for taking the Third Reading of the Civil List Bill immediately after the Report stage, as is now proposed. The Committee stage of the Civil List Bill was concluded only at 12.30 or one o'clock this morning, and it is surely an abuse of the procedure of the House to ask us to agree to this Motion.\n\nI am not going to traverse the arguments which have been advanced both for and against this Bill. What I want to make quite clear at the present moment is that there is no case now for this Motion, that we on this side of the House, or, at any rate, some of us, are prepared to give whatever further time is necessary 544 for the dignified and decorous discussion of this Bill and other legislation which the Government have in mind. For this reason, I want to register my objection to this Motion, and I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer may, in the new circumstances that have arisen since he put down this Motion, be prepared to withdraw it.\n\n§ Mr. Emrys Hughes\n\nMay I, who took part in the debate on the Civil List Bill and sat into the early hours of the morning, say a few words in opposing this Motion? Why is there urgency to rush the Civil List Bill through without due consideration of every aspect of it, especially in view of the circumstances of the Bill and the fact that we are likely to get the opportunity only once in a generation to discuss the principles outlined in it?\n\nI submit that a large number of hon. Members were unable to hear the very cogent, elaborate and complicated arguments of the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton), who went into detail about whether or not the Civil List should he subject to taxation, and that if they were aware of these arguments it would greatly influence their decision on the Bill.\n\nThe difficulty is that hon. Members who were not here will have no opportunity of reading the very elaborate arguments of the hon. Member for Sowerby until the OFFICIAL REPORT appears tomorrow morning. I think that the House should give consideration to those very important and elaborate arguments, and as there is no great urgency for the Civil List Bill this week, it should be discussed on Friday, with 545 decorum and dignity, and should not be rushed through in this way which prevents proper discussion."
