The injury healed perfectly, but a few days later a pimple appeared on tho same thumb, luhinh developed Into a bad case of blood poisoning, giving him much trouble.

A disease among horses that is new to this part of the country has recently appeared In several counties of western Pennsylvania, and is engaging tbe atten tion of veterinarians and members of the state live Btock sanitary board. The latter give to the disease the name of \"epizootic lymphangitis,\" thongh some call it African farcy. It Is a dangerous disease, and like glanders, is highly contagious and la usually fatal. It resembles farcy in its visible manifestations, is usually characterized by nodules about tbe size of a marble, following tbe course of tbe lymphatics, Inside the bind leg, and In some cases extending to tbe crural mus cles on the outer aspect of the thigh.

The Forest Barge Co. encountered a good deal of bad luck in tbe running of their barges last week. Some distance below Franklin, where considerable blasting has been going on during tbe summer in the coustructlon of a new railroad, a large boulder bad been blown into tbe channel, and on this rock two barges were badly damaged, one of tbe big craft being almost ruined, and anoth- so badly stove In at the bottom that it sank in about five feet of water. It will require considerable time and expense to raise and float this barge, and this, with the damage to others, will run up the ex pense account to pretty noarly the price of one of tbe barges which is in the neigh borhood of fl, 700. Wind interferes ma terially in the running of these big boats during the daytime, so that much of the running has to be done after night when the weather is calm. Ethel A.

Tbe remains were brought to Tionesta Saturday afternoon and given burial In Riverside cemetery, the services at tbe grave being conducted by Rev. W. O. Calhoun. At last the new state road above Tubbs run Is completed, and it is expect ed the job will formally be accepted by the Stale authorities this week and taken off the contractor's hands. He will how ever, be required to keep tbe ditches cleaned out and the bed In proper order until next May. The Job has been a te dious one, freighted as it was with many discouraging elements, bad weather, be lated transportation, etc., but Mr. Bigley, the contractor, has stuck to It assiduously, and the result is a very fine piece of Macadam road, which will last for ages If given proper attention by tbe township road supervisors at the right time. But If neglected it will not last three years. This does not mean that a great amount of money or time must be expended In keeping up tbe road, but it does mean that the ditches must be kept cleaned out, and no water allowed to stand In them, and this will be a comparatively easy and inexpensive job if promptly attended to. Tbe TI6nesta Reading Club baa adopted a program and course of reading for a portion of the ensuing year and is now meeting regnlar.y each Wednesday afternoon.

Tionesta has a strictly first class bak eryone that Is not surpassed In the ex cellency of Its output in any city In the state. Mr. Myers, a thoroughly accom plished artist in his line, gives bis per sonal aupervislon to the work, and we believe all wbo have \"tasted bis wares\" will acknowledge their superiority over any goods that are shipped into town. He has established a fairly good trade by giving customers tbe very finest that can be bad in the lino of bread stuffs, but his facilities are such that be could turn out many times as much work as he now has customers for, and that would afford bim a living profit. Tbe margin of profit on a barrel of flour at present prices of that commodity Is very small, but if be bad the exclusive trade of tbe town and sur roundings it would aflord him a nice and fair Income. Mr. Myers came to our town hoping there would be sufficient business to keep bim here. He would like to stay here with bis family, bnt that will be out of the question if our citizens persist In patronizing outside institutions in his line. He attends closely to his business, being up late at nigbt and early in the morning, and Is doing his share towards giving tbe people a Btric.tly first class article of fresh bread, and pas try of all kinds. It Is up to them to say whether they want to drive him out of town, or to keep bim here by extending their patronage on a \"live and let live\" basis. We do not believe be is asking too much.

Angelina Woods, tbe beloved wife of W. W. Walford, of this borough, died at ber borne on Oct. t)tb, 11107, at tbe age of 56 years, 2 months and 11 days.

The funeral was held from the late home of the deceased on Friday after noon, and was largely attended by rela tives and friends. Rev. H. A. Bailey conducted the services, and the remains were laid to rest In Riverside cemetery. (iraml Opening.
