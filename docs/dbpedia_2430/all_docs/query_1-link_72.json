In the vanished days Of pirate capitalism, work- men toiled day and night for starvation pay under conditions that would shame a Red slave labor ramp. Factory laws and minimum wage laws, which most employers fought savagely every inch of the way, helped to change things for the better. But the real credit for giving the worker a fair deal and a fair shan* of the goods he produces must go to the trade unioas formed by the workers themselves under severe handicaps. Karly trade unionists were beaten up by thugs and jailed on conspiracy charges. The law long held that the employer's property — his money and plant — were sacred — but the worker's property — his labor — was a thing of no importance. If it were not for trade unions, most workers would still be toiling long hours for scanty pay. * * * Today unioas are accepted and employers are en- lightened. If unions could be destroyed by a wave of a wand, many employers would nevertheless beat wages down os fast and as far as the law allowed The opponents of unions say that unions ace greedy and drunk with power. Some unions may be, and the reason is simple. Their long history of oppression left many workers with a bitter feeling which is taking more than a generation to disappear Because em- ployers were greedy long ago, some uniorts are greedy now. It Is a natural reaction. Sooner or later they will strike a middle course. Many union members see the employer as an ogre bent on cheating and starving them. This Is no longer true. The employer could not do so. even if he wished to. Unions are also accused of fostering laziness. In some cases the charge Is justified, in most cases not. Where it is justified, the same causes can be cited. Men whose grandfathers were worked to death are teaching their sons to take it easy. Sooner or later they will learn that they have to produce fair work for fair pay. But is pay always fair? Not by any means. The unions are there to see that it is. Intelligent unionists will 'ask that their union act In a responsible way. They will not permit the affairs of their union to be run by a minority through indiffer- ence of the rank and file in attending meetings. In some cases, this very thing ha« happened. They should weigh the fairness of their demands, ask a little more than they expect to get. for bargain- ing’s sake, and try to cast out the old inherited suspicion of an employer as a stock villain. Unions are not to blame for inflation. The thing is far more complex than that. They simply serve as a convenient scapegoat. Employers often use a small wage increase as an excuse for a large price increase. If employers claim they are losing money and can not meet wage demands, let them prove It with figures. If the figures are honestly presented, reasonable men will take heed of them. Uty Homans Poem Published A Victoria poet, Mrs. F. F.

INDUSTRIAL wages in British Columbia already are far above the Canadian aver- age. and one sometime# wonders if the unions and labor leaders in their demands for larger and larger increases ever slop to reflect on what is happening to the indus- tries of this province in relation to Ihe rest of the Dominion. By the latest available returns British Columbia's $60.07 average weekly wage in industry is $4.43 a week higher than the average in Ontario, and whatever settlements are made of current dispute*, the disparity is bound to be widened. A high average wage is supposed to re- flect a state of prosperity, but the painful fact is that British Columbia is rapidly pric- ing itself out of domestic and foreign markets. Anyone disposed to doubt that has only to read the statement made in Vancouver this week by Mr F. W More a director of the department of defense pro- duction. \"Higher labor rates more than any- thing else.\" he said, \"put British Columbia at a fatal disadvantage with eastern Cana- dian plants.\" Nor wax Mr. Hore speaking in vague generalities. Discussing the allocation of future defense contracts, he made a state- ment which should shake the confidence of those who seem to think that this province can go on elevating its wage rates and still hold a place in competitive industry. With the exception of shipbuilding contracts, placed on the West Coast because needed facilities already exist therp, no major de- fense production orders will lie placed in B.C. this year. In 1951-52 B.C. recelv<*d defense con- tracts totaling S60.0<X),(XX). At first Rian. e that may seem a large amount, but actually It represents only a little more than 4 per cent or the total allocation of defease orders in that year. This year, with more money than ever l>eing spent on productiqn for de- fense. British Columbia's share of contracts will he down to $29.000, (XX); and Mr. Hore made it plain that if shipyard accommoda- tion were available elsewhere, the West Coast prolwihly would not get even that. It is all very well to maintain that British Columbia, whose taxpayers provide a sub- stantial proportion of the funds for defense, should receive a large share of the work; hut as Mr. Hore has pointed out, it is against govrrnmppt |>oHey to encourage non-eco- nomie production. It certainly is against the interests of the Dominion taxpayers as a whole. So the labor leaders of this province must reconcile themselves to the truism l hat they can’t eat their cake and have it. A gain In wage rqtes will be hollow indeed if it kills industries and the jobs they make. A Recurrent Dilemma A FACTOR that should be significant in assessing national preferences for peace rather than war is the distaste for military .service shown by male citizens of the western allies. Left to themselves comparatively few men would join the armed forces. Practi- cally all of thp N.A.T.O. nations have found It necessary to introduce some kind of draft system in order to meet the threat of armed aggression posed by the Communist world. No better denial of the charge of war- mongering. in so far as the west is concerned, could be found than this. This creditable personal attitude is nevertheless one that gives deep concern to the nations concerned, since it is a paramount need to have in being strong and efficient forces for the sake of self-nreservation. The problem has been sharply emphasized this week in Canada, alone except tiny In- land among N.A.T.O. nations in having no form of compulsory selective service. The unexpected length of the Korean campaign has run out the time of many men enlisted irt the special force, and Ottawa is experi- encing difficulty in retaining them in uni- form. Of the original recruitment of 10.000 approximately one quarter have taken their discharge. A continuation of this trend could cause this country’s Korean fori-e to fade away, or at least be severely truncated, heme the new inducement planned by federal author- ities. This is reported to take the form of granting discharge gratuities without the discharge, the hope being that such a finan- cial lure will persuade men to stay in the army. Whether it will or not remains to be seen. What the situation does make clear lieyond doubt, however, is that so long ns the federal government shrinks frqm facing facts so long will it lie in a dilemma over recruitment. One doubts that this oeuntry can ever play its full part in the western alliance until it emulate* its allies and intro- duces ‘jome method of selective service. Hoodlumism Is Curable -THERE have been hoodlums In all ages The fact ihnt a press of them seem to gravitate downtown, hang around street corners ami in doorways, scrawl their names on buildings, make objectionable remarks in the presence of strangers and generally act their mental age is no general charge against youth — far to the contrary. Adoles- cence is a difficult age, but the vast majority of young Canadians have far too much to do with their time than to loiter like a com- mon nuisance in public traffieways. It is the moronic few w'hn make this exhibition of themselves, and likely there always will he some residue of feebleminded, immature, maladjusted individuals in an urban society. Also, there is a cure for it. Even the corner sloueher comes from some home is subject to some parental authority, There is a lapse first In family control before human time can be put to such an obvious waste. Next, the sane, orderly and progres- «lve ranks of youth, not only through ex- ample, hut also directly by their reception of such antics, can help a lot to cure the silly practice. Then there is the street patrol. No town can do without it* night watch and, even though understaffed, Vic- toria will yet have to pay a good deal more attention to this ordinary, run of the mill, police work. Finally, hoodltims found in the act of creating public mischief by damaging property or other witless acts can be. and should be. dealt with severely in the courts A few- examples set in a disciplinary way would go far to discourage repetition The unpardonable part of the currently protested display on a few of Victoria’s down- town streets is the molestation of citizens. There is no reason whatever why the com- munity should tolerate that. The cure seems to be a co-operative one. Homes, police, court* and all agencies coming into contact with this objectionable practice can unite to stamp it out. In the long run that Is in the irJ crest of the drifters themselves, who never will grow up if permitted to persist in such childishness. Hoodlumism isn’t smart. It is merely feebleminded, Readers’ Forum letlan In Uw '4IIM m *n« ««o»r *1 «*n*tn» 1nwr»»l tn »*m<v m« it in r» iri *rl*f arrant* tail T»l*. s* WH-r Mill *♦ m »h«1* nr In *»r» • •mpt «»* r ih* ngnatur* an* i04tm .1 .«« arltrr TThmiIIcIImI i_crt*»ponfJ»n' • eannut Ur r*i-irnr4 , WO« I A I.

It is an infectious disease. And a dangerous one. For to aim at leadership is to excite jealousy and suspicion of ihe Kremlin. There are already rumors that Rakosl is sus- pect. The turn of the others will come. * * ★ For there is another aspect of the matter. Stalin has rnnsolidaied, for the time being, hi* grip on the .Soviet I'nion Itself. And it L* overlooked that in doing su he “liquidated” not only every potential rival at the centre, but every local or national lender of any standing or any Independence, There Is not one uf the \"free republics\" which con-ilitute Ihe Soviet I’nion in which the government and the Com- munist Party has not been remorse- lessly \"purged.\" eu that there should be no shred of Independence left.
