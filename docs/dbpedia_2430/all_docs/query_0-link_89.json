It is then necessary to apply the active substance (layer (iv) ) to the laminate (to the combination of layers (i) to (iii) ) and then to secure the active substance in place by providing the backing layer (layer (v) ) .\n\nthe materials are fed horizontally and a discrete amount of the active substance is deposited at a fixed interval, or station, along the laminate, with the backing material then being brought into position in order to cover the active substance prior to the backing material being secured, for example by sealing, to the laminate in regions around the discrete amounts of active substance.\n\nthe process is non- continuous and known as 'form, fill, seal 1 such as is demonstrated by a blister packer. It requires substantial re-tooling if volumetric changes to the reservoir are desired.\n\na first layer of material is caused to travel vertically downwards close to, and parallel to, a second layer of material.\n\none layer is transparent and the other is opaque and contains instructions and other information.\n\nthe two layers of material are brought together and are sealed to each other by opposing pairs of sealing devices, e.g. heated wheels, which act on the opposing longitudinal edges of the two strips of material being brought together.\n\nan intermittent sealing mechanism acts transversely across the juxtaposed layers already joined at their opposing longitudinal edge regions, so that a pouch results.\n\na telephone card, or the like is fed into the pouch which still remains open along its upper (fourth) edge.\n\nthe fourth open edge of the pouch is closed, typically by the same horizontal sealing mechanism.\n\nthe most efficient way of achieving this is for the upper edge of a lower pouch to be sealed at the same time as the lower edge of the immediately upper pouch is being sealed. Both sealing operations can be carried out simultaneously by the same sealing arrangement.\n\nthe pouches can be separated from each other by cutting, or else a line of weakness can be formed in the region between the upper seal of the lower pouch and the lower seal of the upper pouch so that the -4 - pouches are still joined in end to end relationship but with a line of weakness which can readily be ruptured.\n\nSomewhat similar equipment can also be used for creating pouches containing other products, such as sugar or sauces (for use in restaurants) .\n\na method of forming a transdermal patch which comprises the steps of: feeding at a first linear speed a strip of materials comprising a disposable layer, a layer of adhesive and a layer of a permeable membrane; feeding into close proximity and in face-to- face relationship with the first strip at least one second strip formed of impermeable backing material (s), at the same first linear speed; passing the first and second strips together through a first sealing station at which at least the opposed longitudinal edge regions of the strips are secured together, optionally with intermediate regions of the strips being secured along their Lengths, so as to form at least one elongate chamber; passing the first and second strips joined at least at their longitudinal edges, through a second sealing station at which the strips are sealed to each other transversely at intervals along the strips, whereby the or each chamber becomes an open-topped pouch; introducing a liquid containing an active substance into the pouch or pouches, once formed; and sealing the pouches along their previously open edges so as to form\n\nthe process is continuous as a result of the dosing and patch formation happening in a synchronised/simultaneous manner.\n\nThis is distinct from the blister technique which is a station-by-station function and non-continuous .\n\nthe upper previously open region of a pouch or pouches is sealed and the sealing simultaneously closes the bottom of the pouch or pouches immediately above the first mentioned pouch or pouches.\n\nthe method can also include a separation cutting step, in which a transverse cutting exercise takes place so as to separate one sealed pouch containing the active substance from the adjacent pouches upstream and downstream. If a tear-tab at one corner of the patch is required, a suitable \"kiss-cut\" function can be provided at this stage.\n\nother functions such as registration, embossing and de-bossing, can be performed at, or immediately after, this stage.\n\na gas flushing system is employed, which can be achieved by placing a small bore tube adjacent the liquid (gel) delivery tube, which ensures that the pouch will, when sealed, effectively only contain the gel itself and the flushing gas, for example nitrogen.\n\nthe filling and sealing can be effected in a \"vacuum\" .\n\nthe sealing of the adjacent strips can be effected by opposing pairs of sealing devices (e.g. heated rollers) , and the means by which the liquid (gel) containing the active substance is introduced can take the form of a tube the lower, open end of which can be at a level considerably below the axes of rotation of those sealing devices, and can be positioned at a level just above where the transverse sealers are employed which come together intermittently to provide the transverse seals across the strips at the desired spaced intervals. It will be appreciated that careful synchronisation of the different pieces of equipment which carry out the sealing and cutting steps is required, but existing technology is readily available for this .\n\nthe pouch needs to be larger and this can be achieved in one or more ways. If, for instance, during pouch production three pouches are being produced side by side, it is possible to reduce the number of pouches to two which will increase the available width of each pouch. This is done by removing one of the pairs of sealing devices (e.g. heating rollers) and adjusting the location of the remaining intermediate pair of sealing devices; moreover, one of the dosing nozzles is removed.\n\nthe pairs of sealing devices e.g. heating rollers\n\nthe timing of the transverse sealing is adjusted to take place at longer intervals with the result that longer pouches are formed.\n\ntransverse sealing is less frequent during the formation of the longer pouches, it is also necessary that there is corresponding adjustment to the transverse cutting equipment so that the cutting remains along the seal which separates one sealed pouch or row of pouches from the adjacent pouch or row of pouches .\n\nthe tube or tubes, or like, responsible for injecting the gel containing the active substance into the pouches remains in the same position and injects the appropriate volume of gel into the pouch as the transverse seal is being formed or immediately after it has been formed.\n\nAccurate dosing equipment is available to ensure that precisely the desired amount of gel is deposited into each pouch and can be adjusted to compensate for an increase, or decrease, in the volumetric requirements of the pouch in a similar way to the timing adjustment of the sealing devices.\n\nthe materials are fed through the stations in a substantially vertical direction and the liquid containing an active ingredient is introduced into the pouch or pouches in a substantially vertical direction.\n\nthe materials may be fed through the stations in a substantially horizontal direction whilst the liquid is still introduced in a substantially vertical direction.\n\na roll 1 of backing material in the form of a strip 2 which is drawn off from the roll 1 and passed around a tensioning roller 3 , then over a guide roller 4 and another guide roller 5 and passed further downstream.\n\na roll 6 of multi-layer material (of the type mentioned above) with the strip 7 of that material\n\ntransverse intermittent sealing system which comprises two heated bars 21 and 22 which are generally separated from each other but intermittently are brought together to form a horizontal seal across the downwardly travelling strips 2 and 7 whereby the pouches 19 and 20 are then sealed along their lower edges, as well as their vertical \" edges.\n\ntwo tubes which project into the pouches\n\npouches 23 and 24 Shown below the pouches 23 and 24 are two further pouches 25 and 26 produced immediately before the production of the pouches 23 and 24. As shown in the drawing, the lower edge of the pouches 25 and 26 is being acted on by cutting devices 27 and 28 which cut - 11 - transversely across the combined strips 2 and 7 to separate the pair of pouches 25 and 26 from the pair 29 shown below as pouches 30 and 31.\n\nthe sealing system 21, 22 If longer pouches are required, it is merely necessary to cause the sealing system 21, 22 to .operate for the same duration but at greater intervals and for the cutting system 27, 28 also to operate at correspondingly greater intervals. It will also readily be appreciated that the provision of the three pairs 13, 14 and 15 of heated rollers of the sealing system causes the production of two pouches 19 and 20, and that by increasing or decreasing the number of pairs of heated rollers or other sealing devices there is a corresponding increase or decrease in the number of pouches generated in side-by-side relationship.\n\nthe dosing through the tubes (not shown) of the gel containing the active substance can be effected by sophisticated dosing equipment which is available on the market, for example from the company Hibar Systems Limited.\n\nthe dosing of the gel through the tube or tubes into the pouch or pouches is effected as intermittent deposits, the supply of the inert gas through the adjacent tube or tubes to create an inert atmosphere in the pouch or pouches being formed can be effected continuously.\n\nsuitable control equipment it will be possible, at the touch of a button, to alter the - 12 - location of the heated rollers 13, 14 and 15 thereby varying the width of the pouches and also to alter the frequency of the sealing operation of the heating components 21, 22 and cutting components 27, 28 so as to vary the length of the pouches. No re-tooling is necessary.\n\nvariation in the magnitude of the pouches can be effected without having to replace any of the components of the equipment by replacement components.\n\nthe backing material can be flesh-coloured or clear on that side which is to face outwards when the patch is applied to a person.\n\nthe individual pouches can be cropped to provide a 'kiss-cut' 'tear-tab' and be separately packed in their own individual wrappers and batches of the wrappers collected together in packets or other suitable containers.\n\nLandscapes\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nBioinformatics & Cheminformatics (AREA)\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nMedicinal Chemistry (AREA)\n\nPharmacology & Pharmacy (AREA)\n\nEpidemiology (AREA)\n\nVeterinary Medicine (AREA)\n\nAnimal Behavior & Ethology (AREA)\n\nChemical & Material Sciences (AREA)\n\nPublic Health (AREA)\n\nDermatology (AREA)\n\nContainers And Plastic Fillers For Packaging (AREA)\n\nMedicinal Preparation (AREA)\n\nMedicines That Contain Protein Lipid Enzymes And Other Medicines (AREA)\n\nSteroid Compounds (AREA)\n\nAdhesives Or Adhesive Processes (AREA)\n\nEP99915940A 1998-04-14 1999-04-14 Method of manufacturing transdermal patches Expired - Lifetime EP1087758B1 (en)\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (3)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title GB9807917 1998-04-14 GB9807917A GB2336310B (en) 1998-04-14 1998-04-14 Method of manufacturing transdermal patches PCT/GB1999/001138 WO1999052513A1 (en) 1998-04-14 1999-04-14 Method of manufacturing transdermal patches\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date EP1087758A1 true EP1087758A1 (en) 2001-04-04 EP1087758B1 EP1087758B1 (en) 2004-09-15\n\nFamily\n\nID=10830317\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date EP99915940A Expired - Lifetime EP1087758B1 (en) 1998-04-14 1999-04-14 Method of manufacturing transdermal patches\n\nCountry Status (17)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US6871477B1 (tr) EP (1) EP1087758B1 (tr) JP (1) JP2002527353A (tr) KR (1) KR100581472B1 (tr) CN (1) CN1163377C (tr) AT (1) ATE275946T1 (tr) AU (1) AU748493B2 (tr) BR (1) BR9909687A (tr) CA (1) CA2339928A1 (tr) DE (1) DE69920220T2 (tr) DK (1) DK1087758T3 (tr) ES (1) ES2229695T3 (tr) GB (1) GB2336310B (tr) MX (1) MXPA00010130A (tr) PT (1) PT1087758E (tr) RU (1) RU2218135C2 (tr) WO (1) WO1999052513A1 (tr)\n\nFamilies Citing this family (34)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title GB0102725D0 (en) * 2001-02-02 2001-03-21 Stowic Resources Ltd Medical delivery system US20070031477A1 (en) * 2003-03-26 2007-02-08 Lavipharm S.A.
