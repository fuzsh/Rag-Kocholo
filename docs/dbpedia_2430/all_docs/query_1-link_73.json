An Appreciation\n\nn 28 March 2005, Ludo Milis celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday. At this age professors at Belgian universities are required to retire. Whereas reaching emeritus status may be a difficult or at least an emo­ tional moment for many academics, Ludo Milis rounded that cape with the greatest of ease. Two years earlier, in 2003, he surprised many a friend or foe by choosing early retirement from his alma mater, Ghent Univer­ sity. In view of the profound reforms in European higher education her­ alded by the so-called Bologna Declaration of 1999, he preferred to make room for younger academics. In his opinion, it could not be he — who would never experience the final implementation of these reforms anyway — but rather his younger colleagues who should be called to help shape the academic future. Ludo Milis could look back upon a very successful and varied career. The sometimes confusing mix of intellectual boldness and social restraint, of honesty and irony, of kindness and subde provoca­ tion, of critical rigor and aversion to intellectual snobbery, which so thor­ oughly marks his personality and his work, has left none of his students and colleagues untouched. Ludovicus J. R. Milis was born in Antwerp on 28 March 1940, shordy before the outbreak of the Second World War in Western Europe. Al­ though as a small child he did not consciously experience this dark page in history, the lethal bombings of Antwerp by German V-l and V-2 rock­ ets at the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945 are part of his earliest memories. Ludo grew up as the youngest of two children in a family of modest means. His father was an employee in a cannery, his mother a\n\nhousewife. It was she who aroused his curiosity in history and the world of culture, as well as an awareness of social change in post-War Europe. Setting a pattern for the rest of his life, Ludo started his secondary education a year early, at the age of eleven. He enrolled in the Latin and Greek programme of the Royal Athenaeum of Hoboken, where the foun­ dations of some of his future interests were laid. His Dutch teacher there was Paul Lebeau (1908-1982), a committed Flemish militant and then a famous writer of novels and essays. Ludo also struck up lasting friend­ ships, for example with the future sociologist Cornelis (Kees) Kruithof. Upon finishing his secondary education in 1957, he was unsure which direction his further studies would take; he was fascinated by mathemat­ ics, but in the end history won out. His interests in mathematics, however, may explain why, in his historical research and in guiding students, he always placed much emphasis on precise terminology, clearly explained methodology, and the value of quantification; he was also one of the first medievalists to fully embrace computer technology to enrich historical research. The years of Ludo Milis’s academic formation at the so-called His­ torical School of Ghent University witnessed the gradual substitution of the ‘old masters’ by a new generation of medievalists. The former, bom at the end of the nineteenth century, had been trained in medieval history by Henri Pirenne (1862-1935), the ‘godfather’ of the Ghent medieval school1. During his ‘candidate’ and ‘licence’ studies (1957-1961), Ludo Milis worked closely with François-Louis Ganshof (1895-1980), Egied Strubbe (1897-1970), and Hans Van Werveke (1898-1974). Ganshof and Strubbe, both scholars of history as well as law, exerted perhaps the most influence on Milis’s early research. Ganshof was primarily a specialist of institu­ tional history — he gained international renown with his monograph Qu’est-ce que la féodalité?(1941) — and of land exploitation in the Early Middle Ages. Strubbe, an expert in the history of law, was best known for his many editions of primary sources in legal history and his concomitant work in palaeography, diplomatics and other auxiliary disciplines. 1\n\nOn Pirenne’s role as the founder of the ‘École de Gand’ see the Liminaire in F. L. Ganshof, E. Sabbe, and F. Vercauteren (eds.), Études d ’histoire dédiées à la mémoire de H enriPirenneparses anciens élèves (Brussels, 1937), p. v. See also R. C. Van Caenegem, ‘Reflecties bij “Een eeuw Gentse Historische School”’, in Een eeuw Gentse Historische School 1891-1992, ed. by L. François (Ghent, 1993), pp. 7-15.\n\n10\n\nL U D O M IL IS . A N A P P R E C IA T IO N\n\nLike his future colleagues at Ghent, Raoul C. Van Cáenegem and Adriaan Verhulst (1929-2002), Ludo Milis wrote his ‘licence’ thesis under the direction of François-Louis Ganshof. The thesis, completed in 1961, was a solid, traditional study of the demesne of St Salvator’s abbey at Ename during the High Middle Ages2. Ludo was Ganshof’s last thesis student. The work he did with this giant figure of the Ghent school’s sec­ ond generation was also virtually his last to follow closely in the positivist tradition that dominated historical research at Ghent University between Henri Pirenne’s retirement in 1930 and the early 1960s. But even though in his further career he rarely returned to this kind of research, the his­ tory of Ename continued to hold a special place in his work. As a student, Ludo Milis not only impressed his professors and fel­ low students as a promising historian but also threw himself fully into the extracurricular aspects of university life. In 1959-1960, he became the dynamic president of the Vlaamse Geschiedkundige Kring, the organiza­ tion of history students at Ghent founded in 1931 by the future Antwerp city archivist Frans Blockmans. Ludo was also an active member of the regional club Antwerpen Boven, led in the years 1960-1961 by the future journalist and Antwerp alderman Tuur Van Wallendael. Several lifelong friendships were bom at this time, for example with the future Byzantinist Edmond (Mon) Voordeckers, co-author of one of the essays included in this volume3. The most important new development in his life was un­ questionably his love for Greta Proost, a spirited history student two years ahead of him in the history programme; as his wife she would form the cornerstone of his existence until today. One year after his graduation, Ludo Milis became the assistant of Egied Strubbe, who had directed Greta Proost’s ‘licence’ thesis and remained close to her. As Strubbe’s assistant, Milis began his doctoral dissertation on the history of the regular canons of Arrouaise, a religious order formed during the Gregorian reform of the late eleventh century. Until then, re­\n\n2 3\n\nL. Milis, Het domein der Sint-Salvatorabdij te Ename gedurende de Middeleeuwen. 1063-1250 (Unpublished ‘licence’ thesis, Ghent University, 1961). See e.g. : L.

Perhaps for that reason Milis often ventured abroad for research and additional course work. As early as 1961, in the first months after his graduation, he took part in the summer programme of the Centre d’études supérieures de civilisation médiévale of the University of Poitiers. There, he met two famous medievalists who played stimulating roles in his later research: the late Dorn Jean Becquet (1917-2003), monk of the nearby abbey of Ligugé and a respected specialist of the history of medieval mo­ nastic and canonical orders (nine years later, Milis and Dom Bequet co­ edited the Constitutiones of the order of Arrouaise for the Corpus Christianorum4); and the British medievalist Giles Constable, the expert of monastic history in the High Middle Ages, with whom he remained in touch for the rest of his career. In 1962, Milis studied at the University of Cambridge with Christopher Cheney and David Knowles, then among the leading scholars of medieval Church history. Ludo Milis did not finish his dissertation under the auspices of Egied Strubbe. In a new generational shift at Ghent University, Raoul Van Caenegem became a full professor in 1964, and Milis joined him as his assistant. Like Ganshof and to a great extent also Strubbe, Van Caenegem was trained in both history and law; his main interests were institutional and legal history. In the course of his assistantship with Van Caenegem, Milis gained expertise in this area of research and in the editorial scholar­ ship it required. With Van Caenegem, he later edited and commented upon a number of famous Flemish city charters as the output of research seminars conducted with upper level students5. In the mean time, he was able to continue his own doctoral research. On 10 May 1967, he received his PhD as the first of Van Caenegem’s doctoral students. The dissertation was a far more innovative work of church history than its title — The Order of Regular Canons of Arrouaise: History, Institu­ tions and Constitutions from the Foundation of the Mother House (ca. 1090)\n\n4\n\n5\n\nConstitutiones canonicorum regularium Ordinis Arroasiensis, ed. by L.

Two of the authors of this Appreciation remember those seminars with great awe — they inspired more than the occasional nightmare.\n\n12\n\nLU D O M IL IS .

It did not quite fit into the traditions of the Ghent school up to the 1960s, but soon re­ ceived international recognition. The book was not only concerned with narrating the history of Arrouaise in the Middle Ages: rather it subjected that history to comparative analysis within a larger framework, that of the Gregorian reform and the new monastic trends of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries. It also implicidy applied Max W eber’s sociological ob­ servations on the transition, in new religious movements, from charis­ matic origins to institutionalized observance by later followers through the elaboration of all kinds of legal instruments. In subsequent years, and even up to very recendy, Milis returned to different aspects of his disserta­ tion research for several publications, erudite source editions as well as synthetic essays characterized by a wealth of ideas and methodological rigour. These essays caught the attention of his old friend Cornelis Kruithof, who made them the subject of an inspiring sociological analy­ sis7. Thus Ludo Milis had started his university studies guided by the ‘old masters’ at Ghent but finished his dissertation as a new cohort of historians took over, all born around 1930. Soon after Van Caenegem, Adriaan Verhulst and Walter Prevenier also received appointments as full professors. As had been the case with the former generation, the new group of Ghent medievalists presented the Ghent school of medieval his­ tory with a seemingly homogenous and immediately recognizable face to the outside world, while internally working rather independently from each other. The traditional emphasis on the concept of a ‘Ghent School’ tends to obscure the many innovations it generated and the many different ways in which it evolved after Pirenne. Unlike today, when all medieval historians at Ghent are members of the same department, these medieval -\n\n6\n\n7\n\nL. Milis, De orde der reguliere kanunniken van Arrouaise.

They became the breeding ground for the exploration of new historical fields. Immediately after the Second World War, the medievalists Charles Verlinden (1907-1996) and Jan Dhondt (1915-1972) were the founding fathers of the seminars of, respec­ tively, Early M odern and M odern History, with their very own distin­ guished futures; in the 1970s, Adriaan Verhulst laid the basis for a thriving school of agrarian history that was quite different from Ganshof’s institu­ tional approach, while Raoul Van Caenegem became a leading scholar of English legal history and Walter Prevenier generated new approaches to both the auxiliary sciences and the social history of the Late Middle Ages8. Milis thus was trained in an ambiance that paid tribute to long-standing tradition but showed all signs of exploration of the new. While Ludo Milis remained a member of the ‘Seminar of General and Institutional History of the Middle Ages’ directed by Raoul Van Caenegem until its dissolution into the larger department of Medieval History in 1992, he — like his colleagues Hilde De Ridder-Symoens and Monique Vleeschouwers-Van Melkebeek — enjoyed considerable free­ dom to pursue his own research interests. Influenced by historians of the third generation of the French Annales such as Jacques Le Goff or Georges Duby (1919-1996), though always with distinctively personal in­ sight, Ludo Milis became more and more interested in the history of ‘mentalities’. In doing so, he was following in the footsteps of Jan Dhondt, who had pioneered the field in several important publications of the 1950s9,\n\n8\n\n9\n\nSee: R.

A N A P P R E C IA T IO N\n\nbut the two had relatively little personal contact, nor did Milis ever har­ bour the ambition to emulate Dhondt. W hat he and Dhondt held in com­ mon, however, was not only an interest in mental attitudes as an important part of human agency in history, but also the conviction that innovative research had to prickle, even to provoke, in order to be successful, and that erudition for erudition’s sake did not deserve much admiration10. Shortly after receiving his doctoral degree, Ludo Milis was made ‘eerstaanwezend assistent’ at Ghent University. After the sudden death of Jan Dhondt in 1972, he was put in charge of a regular course ‘The His­ tory of the Romance-Language W orld’. Two years later, he became an associate ‘docent’, teaching courses on the ecclesiastical, cultural and reli­ gious history of the Middle Ages as well as the heuristics of research in medieval history and the methodology of cultural history. H e was made an associate professor of history in 1980 and a full professor in 1991. Fol­ lowing Van Caenegem’s retirement in 1992, Milis took charge of the ‘big course’, the ‘Introduction to Medieval History’, required for all beginning students of history. H e became ‘gewoon hoogleraar in 1996. Ludo Milis’s early academic career was closely connected to the protest movement of the late 1960s and the academic reforms of these years. Stu­ dents who took his classes at that time immediately thought of him as the ‘other’, more ‘progressive’ professor, mainly because of his innovative choice of research subjects, but perhaps — students being what they are — also because of his rather revolutionary dress code: tie and suit were replaced by brown corduroy trousers and a turtleneck sweater that has now achieved legendary status among alumni. He was also an innovator in the use of computer-assisted research11. In the late 1970s, Milis started to guide students (and colleagues!) into the personal computer era, firstly with a primitive Commodore 64 machine that all of his thesis students came to know well. Sometimes these classes had little to do with medieval\n\n10 See also W.

In the course of his academic career at Ghent University, Ludo Milis directed fifty-nine ‘licence’ theses and seven doctoral dissertations: his first ‘licence’ student graduated in 1976, and in 1985 his first PhD student completed his dissertation. Most of his students pursued research in the religious history of the Southern Low Countries, in the history of mentalities and daily life in medieval Europe, and in medieval historiog­ raphy12. As a thesis adviser, Milis was not interested in gaining large num­ bers of students. H e liked to stimulate his students by provocation, which charmed some (including the editors of this volume) but disturbed others, not because the latter were more conservative, but rather because, once established truth was demolished, they often found themselves at sea and alone: he was notorious for giving his students a great deal of freedom, starting with the choice of their thesis topic. Ludo Milis always wanted his students to think and to work inde­ pendently from the very beginning, and to come to terms with the fact that scholarship may be a profoundly unsettling enterprise, demanding independence of judgment based on methodologically sound research. But those who worked with him found their initial apprehension gradu­ ally replaced by pride and possibly elation at the discovery that they were scholars in their own right. They knew that in Ludo they could count on an ever accessible and generous sounding board for their questions. Above all, Milis wanted to make sure talented young researchers were not held back in their natural growth as scholars because of too narrow a subject matter or too rigid his guidance. H e may now find satisfaction in observ­ ing how many of his former students successfully found their way into teaching and research positions not only at Ghent University but also at other colleges and universities, even abroad; as curators of manuscripts and archives; as leaders in the booming sector of cultural heritage manage­ ment; or as editors of specialized publishing houses.

AN A P P R E C IA T IO N\n\nmore pleased by the fact that their achievements were made without any lobbying effort on his part, an activity which he always loathed and for which, as a man of principle, he lacked all inclination. O n the political and ideological issues that divided Belgium after the Second World War, Ludo Milis took an early stand in favour of Flem­ ish emancipation, without espousing a narrowly separatist vision. His pro­ foundly democratic convictions put him at odds both with the Belgian monarchy — a medieval anomaly in the modern world — and with certain fascist trends in the Flemish movement. In addition to his interest in reli­ gious and cultural history, he became intrigued by the history of French Flanders and the historical shifts in the boundaries between French and Dutch (Flemish) languages in the region. His first publications on this topic date as far as 1969. In several of these essays, he examined why Ro­ mance (French) languages displaced Germanic languages (Dutch in Northern France and German in Alsace). Taking into account this his­ torical phenomenon, he supported the legal establishment of a linguistic boundary in Belgium from 1963 onwards. Meanwhile, Milis also had the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with Dutch students at the Nutsacademie voorpedagogische en maatschappelijke vorming of Rotterdam, where from 1971 until 1983 he taught several courses in medieval history. The experience may have increased his interest in the old ideal of a culturally united Low Countries, of the old Grootnederlands-perspective, within a newly emerging European con­ text. These ideas never led to a firm political commitment. Milis was (and is) too much of an individualist to move to the frontlines of social debate, let alone to fight on the barricades for a cause. Moreover, his convictions were too strong and too much guided by principle for him to join any political movement, which sooner or later might imply making pragmatic choices. Nevertheless, he actively promoted Dutch-language culture as a member of the Orde van den Prince, a pluralistic society aimed at the pro­ motion of the Dutch language and culture; and as a regular contributor to both Ons Erfdeel, the journal of Dutch culture founded by Jozef Deleu, and its off-shoot, De Pranse Nederlanden—Les Pays-Bas Français, a journal focused on French Flanders. H e also serves on the board of several his­ torical or academic organizations in Northern France, some of which are especially concerned with the study and support of Dutch-language cul­ ture in the region. The growth of the European Union, within which he\n\nLU D O M IL IS . A N A P P R E C IA T IO N\n\n17\n\nprefers to see the cultural emancipation of Dutch and Flemish culture, also affected his academic activities. H e firmly supported the mobility of students within Europe as promoted by Erasmus programmes and edited a textbook on Europe’s medieval religious history, published as one of the first results of the international project Manuels universitaires sur l’histoire de l’Europe13. As a historian, Ludo Milis continued to direct his attention to medieval monks, canons, and hermits. But as indicated above, his interests from about 1980 onward shifted towards religious ‘mentalities’ and to the rela­ tion between powerful religious elites and ordinary people during the Middle Ages. In this new direction, he was drawn into closer contact with several foreign colleagues: Frederik (Frits) W. N. Hugenholtz (1922-1999), Rudi Künzel and Hendrik Teunis, of the Netherlands; Miri Rubin in the U.K.; and, as we will see, several French historians. At Ghent, his new orientation toward the history of mental attitudes and his qualified criti­ cism of the positivist tradition caused clashes with a few colleagues, al­ though they never became disruptive and relations with even the most ‘positivist’ colleagues, such as Adriaan Verhulst (whom Milis always great­ ly respected), remained cordial. It should indeed be noted that despite all of his innovative drive, Milis never renounced his Ghent roots in the sense that he continued to privilege the thorough study of primary sources as the basis of research. In his approach of the primary sources, Ludo Milis always started from two principles: first, the sources used should be ‘representative’; second, they should be studied preferably to answer questions unrelated to the original intentions of their authors (since these naturally determined the explicit content). In his publications, Milis allotted relatively little space to debate with other scholars in medieval studies. That made his approach rather different from that of cultural historians working in the Annales tradition, or from most historians of medieval culture and religion in the English-speaking world. Until today, Milis likes to declare with pride: “I don’t read secondary sources because I can think for myself”,\n\n13 L. Milis (ed.), La chrétienté des origines à la fin du Moyen Âge, Série Europe et histoire (Paris and Brussels, 1998).\n\n18\n\nLU D O M IL IS . AN A P PR E C IA T IO N\n\na provocative motto with which he was and still is able to needle many colleagues. At the same time, however, he displayed a remarkable ability to write historical syntheses that asked probing questions for specialists but were also accessible to a wider audience, such as in his contributions to the Algemene Geschiedenis der Nederlanden, translated in this volume. Although he supposedly (this was of course not really true) did not read the works of others, he did intend to be read. An important turning point occurred in 1989, when Ludo Milis was a member of the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Ad­ vanced Study in Princeton, where Giles Constable was a resident profes­ sor. After many years of gruelling pressure as a teacher, Milis converted for the occasion into the role of a true hermit — one of his favourite re­ search subjects — in a splendid isolation that lasted a good three months. As many reliable but somewhat mystified witnesses report, his social con­ tacts and daily comfort were reduced to the absolute minimum in order to write his most successful and most controversial monograph, Angelic Monks and Earthly Men (1992). This book brought to a close but also questioned years of research and writing on monastic and canonical life. Analysing with Ockhamian rigour the relationship between medieval monasticism and the world outside the monastic enclosure, the book at first met with confused reactions from historians and other critics, who did not always understand the author’s intentions: to define the core values of medieval monastic life and to clearly outline their implications for the society in which monasticism ‘flourished’ but from which, by definition, it must withdraw. Few historians of the Middle Ages before him had re­ flected on the conflict so brilliantly and honestly, as many readers across the globe soon understood: the book was translated into Dutch, Japanese, Italian, and Polish. The following years were among the most prolific in Ludo Milis’s career. In addition to his Angelic Monks, he also edited in 1991 the suc­ cessful De heidense Middeleeuwen (The Pagan Middle Ages). This collec­ tion of essays by form er students and others (with an im portant contribution by himself), completed a series of questions Milis started to ask in the 1980s in his ‘La conversion en profondeur, un processus sans fin’, translated in this volume. The Pagan Middle Ages convincingly coun­ tered the nineteenth-century ideal of the ‘Christian Middle Ages’ and argued for the essential syncretism of medieval religious culture in which,\n\nLU D O M IL IS . AN A P PR E C IA T IO N\n\n19\n\ndespite centuries of Christian evangelization, pagan and Christian ele­ ments were often seamlessly combined. This highly productive period in Milis’s career intensified his international contacts. In 1992, he was a Vis­ iting Fellow at Clare Hall College in Cambridge. Five years later, JeanLoup Lemaitre invited him to the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris for a series of lectures that resulted in a thoroughly revised French version of his Angelic Monks — a version that received much scholarly attention and that became the occasion for a radio broadcast in September 2002, in which Milis was joined by Jacques Le Goff and Michel Parisse in a fascinating discussion of his book14. In the mean time, in 1994, he had published De indiscrete charme van ]an Schuermans, pastoor van Ename (1645-1655) [The Indiscrete Charm of Jan Schuermans, Curate o f Ename, 1645-1655], arguably the book that best illustrates his lifelong interest in the history of mentalities. De indiscrete charme carefully reconstructs, analyses and interprets the true story of a village priest who impregnated a young woman at the time of the Treaty of Münster (1648), as well as the act’s consequences. The book was of course not devoted to the Middle Ages as they are tradition­ ally defined, but for Milis, medieval history did not end in the late fifteenth century. He shared with a few historians of the Annales school a belief in a ‘Long Middle Ages’, lasting until the late eighteenth century15. It was no accident that Schuermans’ story brought Milis back to Ename, the subject of his ‘licence’ thesis. Throughout his career he remained interested in the village with its rich medieval history; he enthusiastically supported the archaeological excavations at the site of St Salvator’s abbey. About Ludo Milis’s newest book, we are still more or less in the dark. During his final year as a professor at Ghent University, he took a sabbatical leave to write a monograph synthesizing several lines of enquiry that had remained un­ published. The editors of the present volume have gathered that the man­ uscript nears completion, but note that they do not know its true subject.\n\n14 ‘Les moines et le peuple’, broadcasted on ‘France Culture’ (Les lundis de l'histoire) on 9 September 2002. 15 The last article in the present volume — ‘State Boundaries and Ethnie Alienation: Perspectives on Research into the Alienation Processes of French Flemings’ — testifies again to his interests in the early seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\n20\n\nLU D O M IL IS . AN A P PR E C IA T IO N\n\nIn the 1990s, Ludo Milis left an important legacy with the Internet database Narrative Sources16. This annually updated online catalogue of all narrative sources from the medieval Southern Low Countries was the main result of different joint projects directed since 1987 by Milis and his colleagues Jean (Jan) Goossens and W erner Verbeke of the Catholic University of Leuven. While the catalogue was largely based on prepara­ tory research by Werner Verbeke and the work of several collaborators, Narrative Sources undeniably bears the stamp of Milis’s inspiring guidance. Firmly centred on the study of primary sources, more specifically on nar­ rative texts (which are so crucial for the study of medieval culture and mentalities), the online catalogue was upon its release in 1996 one of the first of its kind worldwide. Since the catalogue was funded by governmen­ tal grants, Milis insisted that it should be freely accessible — in contrast to many other historical databases. Its technical realization owed much to the collaboration with the Ghent University Library and its pioneering experience in computerized cataloguing techniques developed in the 1990s, under the direction of H erbert Van de Sompel. Narrative Sources proved to be a success: not only is it still consulted daily by dozens of re­ searchers from all over the world, it also inspired a whole range of new doctoral dissertations until today. In 2002, the scope of the database was even enlarged to the Low Countries as a whole, through a Dutch research project coordinated by Renée Nip at the University of Groningen. For many years, Ludo Milis preferred to concentrate his energies on teach­ ing and research; he had initially little interest in serving on the many in­ fluential and prestigious boards that control public grants for research in Belgium. This attitude changed in the mid-1980s. The first important func­ tion he assumed was that of the presidency of the Belgian Historical In­ stitute in Rome, which he held from 1986 until 2001. The position fitted him well: his great love of Italy, its history and culture, its people and lan­ guage, its cuisine and wines, made him take up the task with great enthu­ siasm as well as empathy for the country that hosted Belgian scholars in\n\n16 The Narrative Sources from the Medieval Low Countries— De verhalende hronnen uit de middeleeuwse Nederlanden— Les sources narratives des Pays-Bas médiévaux (Ghent, Louvain, and Groningen: Ovid-database, 1996-2005,10 editions), http://www.narrative-sources.be.\n\nLU D O M IL IS . AN A P P R E C IA T IO N\n\n21\n\nRome; he worked also very hard to improve the quality and distribution of the Institute’s publications. In 1991, he became a member of the Belgian Royal Commission for History, surely the most important of all historical societies in the country but in the 1970s and 1980s sometimes perceived as rather antiquated. Milis had criticized this venerable’ institution in his younger days; as happens so often with former rebels, in 2005 he became the Commission’s President. From 1995 until 2003 he also served on var­ ious committees of the Fund for Scientific Research - Flanders, where he gained a reputation for his discretion, his thorough knowledge of the is­ sues, and his aversion to all lobbying by outsiders. Even before Ludo Milis left academic life, he often indicated to his col­ laborators that he did not want to be honoured with a Liber Amicorum. Although his wish certainly grew from his natural reserve, his experience serving on committees of the Fund for Scientific Research helps to explain his reticence; all too often he noted that contributions to this kind of Fest­ schriften — though very common in the arts and humanities — barely had any scientific impact in most other disciplines. And he also recalled that Henri Pirenne’s Liber Amicorum, published shortly after Pirenne’s death in 1935, caused some tension17. However, he happily welcomed the idea of collecting some of his essays in an English translation that would make available to a larger audience part of his most important work. This volume contains eleven essays published between 1969 and 1990, offering insight in Ludo Milis’s varied research interests. A close examination of his bibliography will reveal that in the period before his Angelic Monks, Milis only rarely published in English. Nine essays in­ cluded here appeared in Dutch or French and have now been translated into English; two essays previously published in English but not widely distributed are also included and newly edited. The first part of this col­ lection is devoted to the religious history of the Low Countries during the Early and High Middle Ages, and to issues of religious conversion and persuasion. These essays, which may serve as the historical framework for many others in the volume, demonstrate Milis’s unusual talent for his-\n\n17 Seenöte 1.\n\n22\n\nLU D O M IL IS . AN A P PR E C IA T IO N\n\ntorical synthesis. The second part contains two fundamental contribu­ tions, inspired by his 1967 dissertation, to the history of the twelfth-century regular canons and their eremitical origins. We next in­ clude three very different case studies in which Milis examines the ways in which ideology and power shape society and its cultural expressions. The volume concludes with a few lesser known, but highly original essays on the social and cultural history of French Flanders, a theme dear to Milis’s heart. Bibliographical references in this volume have been harmonized and in a few cases corrected, but no attempt was made to update them. His emeritus status allows Ludo Milis to choose now more freely among his commitments and activities — scholarly, social, and cultural — and to devote more time to his biggest passion, his family. His famiglia, in its Ital­ ian sense, always played a very important role in his life. His wife Greta, famous for her congeniality and her talents as a hostess, was, and still is, his main pillar of strength and his greatest supporter. Their three children, Huib, Geertje, and Daan left the parental home at Sint-Martens-Latem quite a while ago now, but their visits are naturally always cherished, es­ pecially when they bring along the grandchildren Timo, Illy, and Cosmo. Ludo and Greta continue to visit their Tuscan pied-a-terre in Guardistallo and to travel widely; most recently to Thailand, the ‘motherland’ of their youngest grandson. It is our most profound wish that Ludo and Greta will continue their new path in life in the happiest of circumstanc­ es and for a very long time.

This is a fundamental question, which can only be answered on the basis of a thorough understanding of the extent of conversion in that period. According to their importance, the Roman administration centres had played a more or less early, and a more or less important, role in promoting Christianity. The civitates had become the centres of a number of bishoprics, which meant that secular and spiritual power was exercised from the same centre. ‘Church and State’ in fact went hand in hand from the fourth century onwards. The name of the first bishop to be known with certainty is Servatius (actually the oriental name Zapßcmoc; [Sarbatios]) in Tongres, mentioned in 343. A certain Superior was bishop in Cambrai (or Bavay) in 346. In Tournai there is no reference to a bishop before the sixth century, nor is there such a reference in Thérouanne before the seventh.\n\nD\n\nThe chronology and distribution show how political and geo­ graphic orientation played a role. In the south there were a few towns in the middle of the old tribal areas connected by a network of roads. In the east there was the south to north direction of the rivers — Meuse, Moselle and Rhine — along which Romanization penetrated faster and more in­ tensively than elsewhere in the Low Countries. So the essential problem is whether this first phase of conversion, which progressed in parallel with Romanization, was still so superficial that under the influence of the Ger­ manic invasions the disappearance of Roman control also resulted in the\n\ndisappearance of Christianity. The answer to this question is not simple. On the one hand there are interruptions in the lists of bishops (of about a century for Tongres-Maastricht)1, giving the impression that Christian­ ity, too, disappeared temporarily; on the other hand the question should actually be posed much more widely. Was it in fact the case that the ‘Ro­ man structures’ were completely suppressed, and therefore the Church was, too ? Opinions on this are now undoubtedly more balanced than they used to be. After all, the Merovingians in their exercise of control made use of what remained of the Roman infrastructure (the fortified nature of Tournai explains why the Merovingians chose it as their capital). So the possibility that the ecclesiastical element had not wholly disappeared ei­ ther cannot be ruled out. How otherwise can the continued topographical existence of the late-Roman civitates in the early-medieval urban centres be explained ? Only in the case of Tongres is there a shift — which can be ex­ plained on other grounds — with first Maastricht and then Liège becom­ ing the seat of the bishop. The more we become convinced of a degree of survival of the Roman structures, the more we are inclined to attach full credence to the indications of a continuing Christianity ; recent research into patrocinia or church dedication names allows many churches of St Stephen to go back to late-classical times, and the same goes for some churches of O ur Lady. O f course this only applies to regions that were heavily Romanized (such as the valley of the Scheldt, where Cambrai and Tournai were situated). The flight of a number of Christians from Tournai to the neighbouring Blandain, as told in the Vita Sancti Eleutherii, should be regarded in the light of a surviving colony of Christians in the time of the first Merovingians. But more than the texts (and certainly the hagio­ graphie texts), archaeology has recendy produced new evidence. For in­ stance, there is no longer any doubt that from late-classical times burials went on without interruption in the church yard round St Servaas in Maas­ tricht — the tombstones of a certain Amabilis and Aluvefa have sur­ vived— and moreover that they were Christian burials. A wooden chapel above the grave of Servatius was replaced by a larger structure around 560. 1\n\nP. C.

W hat was going on in the countryside ? Could Christianity survive in these areas, when there is even doubt whether it had penetrated there to any significant extent in the late Empire ? The answer is a qualified positive. As evidence, objects with Christian motifs can be cited, found in fifth-century burial grounds (among others at Haillot and Pry in the prov­ ince of Namur), which belonged to the Mediterranean tradition, but were made at Châtel-Chéléry in the Ardennes. They differ from the sixth- and seventh-century cross motifs which have survived as amulets or on the bottom of vases (as at Haine-Saint-Paul, in the province of Hainault). Here a moribund Gallo-Roman Christianity, which to some extent survived the barbarian invasions, was faced with the infiltration of the beliefs of the invading peoples2. In the Merovingian period, which witnessed a ‘second conversion’, society had clearly become rural. O f course, the ethnic make-up of the population had changed. More generally, the political situations which determined the possibilities and the orientation of conversion had altered. The diocesan bishop, the central figure in the late-Roman church, surrounded by his clergy, only played a limited role in conversion. None­ theless it was in this early-medieval stage that in these old frontier regions of the Roman Empire the diocesan organization originated which would continue to exist until the reforms by Philip II in 1559. The old Roman organization with a Belgica secunda, divided into a number of civitates, became the framework of the diocesan organization without a great deal of adjustment. This does not mean that the boundaries of these episcopal civitates were precisely the same as those of the Roman administrative organization. We have, after all, insufficient information on the precise demarcations of the diocesan boundaries in the early Middle Ages. More­ over, there are also indications that the Frankish fifth-century realms may have been a factor in setting those boundaries. At the end of the fourth century there was only the bishopric of Tongres in what would later be the Low Countries. The region came under the Roman province of 2 G. Faider-Feytmans, La Belgique à IIépoque mérovingienne (Brussels, 1964), pp. 123— 32.\n\nT H E C O N V E R S IO N O F T H E LO W C O U N T R IE S\n\n55\n\nGermania secunda, which meant that Cologne became the seat of the arch­ bishop. The other regions belonged to Belgica secunda, so they came under Rheims. The fifth century has left remarkably few traces : the list of bishops of Tongres, for example, which gives seven names between Servatius and Falco, is not to be trusted. Falco who was bishop when Remigius was enthroned in Rheims, had colleagues at Arras (perhaps dating back to a late-imperial organization)3and Tournai : Vedastus (d. 540 ?) and Eleutherius (d. 531 ?). Flagiographic sources attach stories to them for which it is difficult to recover the historical core. The diocesan organization was completed in the late sixth and seventh century: Gaugericus (584-590) appeared in Cambrai in that period. That see became joined with the diocese of Arras, and this link lasted until the very end of the eleventh century. A similar situation occurred in Tournai (577) which was joined to Noyon until 1146. The last bishopric in these old frontier regions, the territories of the Morini, the extremi homines of the Roman texts, was Thérouanne. Audomarus, a missionary from what later became Norman­ dy, was the first holder of the office here (before 639). We do not know much about the bishops themselves. Only their cult as saints and an oc­ casional mention in documents give us hints. Peripatetic missionar­ ies — sometimes with an episcopal consecration or later promoted to bishops — are the leading figures of the conversion process. On the whole missionaries were sent from two directions : there was a Southern-French group and an Irish-Scottish one. St Amand is the best example of the first. H e came from Aquitaine, and after a period in Tours and Bourges he travelled to Rome, where he had a vision telling him to go and convert the Gauls. H e was active in various regions, but particularly in the valley of the Scheldt. Here he did missionary work in the old settlement of Ganda (the original Ghent), in the area of Chanelaus (the former Calóes in the south of the present-day Antwerp municipal area) — where Eligius was also working about that time — and in the diocese of Tongres, of which the seat was moved to Maastricht in the sixth century. H e spent several years here, probably holding the office of bishop. The information about\n\n3\n\nF.

The missionaries dealt with this in two ways : by the ostentatious destruction of ‘idols’ and shrines and by the deliberate organization of Christian cults in pagan sanctuaries. Elst — although this has nothing to do with Amand — appears to be an example of a pagan cult centre which was changed into a Christian church, though there is no absolute certainty of this. Eligius (St Eloi) can be put on an equal footing with Amand ; he came to the Low Countries from the South of France under King Dagobert I, and was bishop of Noyon-Tournai from 641. Traces of paganism nevertheless continued to exist in the regions covered by Tongres-Maastricht, and of course throughout the north. In Maastricht, which had been the seat of the bishopric since the second half of the sixth century, Lambert was appointed bishop in the late seventh century. H e was engaged principally in the conversion of Texandria. His violent death at Liège (c. 700) led to a cult of him as a saint and to the relocation of the seat of the civitas Tungrorum to Liège under his successor H ubert (c. 717). He, too, took on Texandria and the Ardennes — thinly populated regions, difficult of access, and so difficult to convert. A men­ tion of Brabant, where according to his vita he was also active, probably refers to the region around Dijle and Zenne, the territory on the bound­ ary between his diocese and that of Cambrai. As has been said, there were also the Irish-Scottish missionaries. They came straight from Ireland or from the north of England (Northum­ bria), preceded by Columbanus, who in the late sixth century had found­ ed the monastery of Luxeuil (Eastern France). They maintained close links with Rome (the consequence of the Synod of Whitby, 664, when the iso­ lationist-oriented Irish Church and the English Church inspired by Rome came to an agreement), which brought them to the Low Countries. When we take into account that exile for the purpose of preaching (the peregrinatio of the texts) was one of the missions in life of these monks, their actions become comprehensible. This will be fully illustrated by the career of Willibrord. Missionary activities depended on monks. They lived by one of the rules which had penetrated into the west from the east and south of Europe, or by one of the strict Irish rules like that of Columbanus. But that they belonged to the monastic world implied that their missions started from the centres they developed, their abbeys, outposts in an at the time still pagan environment. These missionaries are\n\nT H E C O N V E R S IO N O F T H E LO W C O U N T R IE S\n\n57\n\nwithout exception known for having founded abbeys and their success was guaranteed by the stability (and soon the wealth and power) of their monasteries. Moreover their Nachleben was cultivated and promoted by the abbeys who looked on them as their founders. Here, too, vitae provide the essential, not always reliable, information, while the study of patroc­ inia also appears promising. After a first batch of country churches, built by the first missionaries themselves and dedicated to universal saints, a new batch followed from the seventh century onwards, founded by their successors, and dedicated to themselves. This conversion to Christianity within the Merovingian territory had a political dimension which should not be underestimated. The fa­ mous conversion of King Chlodowich (Clovis) (496) is indeed a milestone, but it gives no date for the conversion of the Franks as a whole. Nor does it say anything about the depth of their conversion, certainly not in the northern frontier areas of the kingdom where the indigenous population was thin on the ground and the number of Frankish immigrants therefore carried more weight. In addition to the abbeys, the royal land holdings (in part old Roman state property) played a role in the dissemination of the faith and in developing a network of village churches. This so-called Reichsmission (royalty led mission) became an important element in the spread of churches dedicated to St Martin. The northern frontier re­ gion — the southern part of the later Low Countries — was thus witness to the founding of a dense network of abbeys. The earliest was Elnone (later St Amand’s, nowadays Département du Nord) which was founded by Amand before 6394. Later historiography and hagiography assigned a role to this missionary in the founding of many other monasteries. It is certain that he played this role in the cases of St Bavo’s in Ghent and the abbey of Nivelles. In a first phase, until about 730, forty-five houses, for men and women, were founded in the south. The largest group was situ­ ated in the area between the Scheldt and the Sambre. These were outposts from which the conversion towards the north would have to be organized. Elnone, the two abbeys at Ghent (St Bavo’s and St Peter’s), Lobbes, Foss­ es, St Bertin’s at Saint-Omer, and St Trond should be mentioned here.\n\n4\n\nH.

Jonas of Bobbio, one of Amand’s helpers, had been a student of Columbanus at Luxeuil. The abbeys were founded by members of the top social classes : great nobles, mayors of the palace, and kings, who endowed them richly (St Amand’s received a foundation donation of about 10,000 hectares) and granted them exemption rights3*5. After the death of the first group of mis­ sionaries, the abbots and abbesses of these institutions — who would later become the new local saints — were recruited from these same cir­ cles. Gertrude of Nivelles is a typical example. In contrast to what would become the tendency under the Carolingians, the typical abbey complex consisted of various smaller churches, each of which had a specific function. In St Vaast’s at Arras there were five, at Andenne as many as seven6. We have very little information about the actual spirituality of these monasteries, since the sources — the vitae — are mostly of a later date. It is also difficult to see how any osmosis was achieved between the strict, very ascetic rule of Columbanus and the hu­ mane, balanced rule of Benedict. The influence of the diocesan bishops on the abbeys and hence on conversion was limited. In the Irish tradition there were suffragan bishops who led missions from and for the monaster­ ies, but who had no individual see. The existence of abbot-bishops (in any case of Remaclus) at Stavelot-Malmédy must be explained in this way. The churches were very often built on Merovingian cemeteries, which in the late sixth and seventh centuries showed traces of Christian­ ity. This is supported by the excavations carried out, among other places, at Arlon and Rosmeer, where bullae, small boxes with Christian motifs which were used as amulets, were found. The fact that some objects\n\n3\n\nR. R. Post, ‘Die Christianisierung des Limburgischen Raumes’, A rchief voor de gescbiedenis van de Katholieke Kerk in Nederland, 3 (1961), pp. 234—46 ; K. F.

The northern part of the Low Countries only finds its way into religious history when King Dagobert (632-639) decided to conquer the Delta area. A letter of a hundred years later tells us that the king had donated the castellum Utrecht to Bishop Cunibert of Cologne, together with the small church built there for the Frankish garrison, on condition that it would be used for the conversion of the Frisians. That Cunibert did nothing about it, and Willibrord later found the little church destroyed, explains the difficulties between Utrecht and Cologne under Boniface. The expulsion of the Franks from Utrecht in the mid-seventh cen­ tury postponed a new attempt at conversion to the years 678-679, when Wilfrid, the bishop of York, preached as an exile among the Frisians. He did not have much success, though he did prepare the way for the effective mission led by Willibrord. This monk from northern England carried out his mission in close cooperation with the Carolingian mayors of the palace. W hether he first operated out of Antwerp, as an outpost on the edge of what was then Frisia, is far from certain. The conversion of the north fits completely into the Frankish rulers’ policy of annexation of the Frisians and a little later of the Saxons. Pepin n, mayor of the palace, conquered Fresia citerior in the last years of the seventh century, and Willibrord and his companions took part in the conversion from 695. H e was directed to do so by the pope, who granted him the title of ‘archbishop among the people of the Frisians’. At Utrecht, St M artin’s church was rebuilt and that of St Salvator founded ; there missionaries were trained. As material support for its activities the church of Utrecht was granted a tithe on all royal properties and revenues. Spiritual and material support was ensured by the establishment of the abbey of Echternach, in the region converted earlier"
