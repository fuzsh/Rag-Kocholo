Biography

British musician who organized "The Kinks" in late '63 with his brother Ray, playing a sizzling corkscrewing guitar. In early 1964 they made a debut record of two numbers, released also in the U.S. with no big success, but later in the year they made a major hit that was a top seller on two continents, "You Really Got Me." The Kinks entered the Rock'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

The son of a London suburbs gardener and a housewife, he began performing rhythm and blues in local pubs at 13 along with Ray, 16. Three years later they formed a bank called the "Bo Weevils," then the "Ravens," singing Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters classics. They became a hot act at society parties with their wild raging sound and long hair. Someone called Ray a "kink" as a put-down and the name stuck. In 1964 they recorded their first album and began to stage their truly raucous international concert tours, an onstage rowdiness that often incited the audience to riot. They were barred from Scandinavia, and from the U.S. 1966-'68.

The spats between the two brothers were much publicized. Dave periodically rebelled against Ray's domination of the Kinks and there has been fistfights, angry stage exits and furious trashings of expensive equipment.
