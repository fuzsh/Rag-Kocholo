        "text": "Name: Tudor Davies\n\nDate of birth: 1892\n\nDate of death: 1958\n\nSpouse: Ruth Davies (née Packer)\n\nParent: Sarah Davies\n\nParent: David Davies\n\nGender: Male\n\nOccupation: singer\n\nArea of activity: Music; Performing Arts\n\nAuthor: Huw Williams\n\nBorn 12 November 1892 in Cymer, Porth, Rhondda, fifth son of David and Sarah Davies. Before taking up a musical career he worked in the mines and during World War I as an engineer in the navy. He was educated in the University College at Cardiff. He won a scholarship at the Royal College of Music in London, and sang in opera and held concerts in the U.S.A., Canada and Australia. In 1922 he joined the British National Opera Co. and remained with that company for the rest of his career. He portrayed Rudolfo in London in 1922, and in 1924 he sang the leading role in the first public performance of Hugh the Drover (Vaughan Williams) in His Majesty's Theatre. He was principal tenor in Sadler's Wells, 1931-41, and with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, 1941-46; and as a resident member of the company in Sadler's Wells he portrayed the leading role in the first English performance of Don Carlos (Verdi) in 1938. He was invited to sing in every one of the leading music festivals in Great Britain and America. He had a warm and virile voice, and always sang with dignity and sincerity. His voice was recorded between 1925 and 1930, and the part of The Dream of Gerontius (Elgar) which was recorded in Hereford cathedral in 1927 with the composer conducting is a notable example of his style. He married the soprano Ruth Packer; and died 2 April 1958.\n\nAuthor\n\nHuw Williams, (1922 - 2002)\n\nSources\n\nWho was who?, 1951-60\n\nWelsh Music, the journal of the Guild for the Promotion of Welsh Music, 3 (1970), 34-5\n\nY Ford Gron: Papur Cymru'r byd, December 1934\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDean Powell, Celebrating WNO’s founder tenor on their 75th Anniversary (accessed May 2021)\n\nWikipedia Article: Tudor Davies\n\nAdditional Links\n\nVIAF: 7573643\n\nWikidata: Q7851276\n\nPublished date: 2001"
