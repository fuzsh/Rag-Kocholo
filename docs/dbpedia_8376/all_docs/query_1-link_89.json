        "text": "Happy belated birthday to Ray Davies, the frontman of The Kinks! He turned 79 years old yesterday, June 21st.\n\nThe Kinks are one of my all-time favorite bands and one that I will always include in my top five no matter the circumstances – and that is saying a lot because my top five bands continuously change depending on my musical mood at that very moment!\n\nRay is such an incredible songwriter, in my opinion, one of the best to ever do it, and Dave Davies is easily one of the most underrated lead guitar players in the world. Together, with some others, they form a legendary band.\n\nThey may not be as popular as bands such as The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, but The Kinks are undoubtedly one of the most influential British bands to ever grace a microphone or stage.\n\nThey have not been together as a band as of late, but hopefully, they will reunite one more time for the world to enjoy, please!\n\nIf not, I will always have some great moments involving the band to look back on, such as the few times I got to meet Ray, including one time back in 1990, which is when the main photo from this article was taken!\n\nThe photo is from a night back in 1990 at Hofstra University backstage with my college buddy, Lou.\n\nWe used to absolutely blast some of The Kinks’ LPs in the dorms at Kent Hall at SUNY Plattsburgh, so it was a thrill to snag a picture that night with Ray.\n\nIt honestly feels like just yesterday, to be honest!\n\nIt is crazy to think that many of our classic rock icons are almost pushing 80 years old these days.\n\nHopefully, Ray enjoyed his birthday yesterday and maybe I will spin a Kinks record or two when I get home in honor of his day yesterday!\n\nMore from Matt Cord…\n\nVisiting the C&D Canal Bike Trail is a Must Do This Summer\n\nMatt Cord is the host of the Matt Cord Show. He is a lover of all Philly Sports and has been the voice of the Sixers for 27 years and NBA2K for the past 4 years. As a cyclist enthusiast, Matt writes about his adventures all throughout the city."
