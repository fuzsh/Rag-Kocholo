        "text": "Dave Davies has covered local politics and government in Philadelphia for more than 30 years.\n\nHe loves the speed, reach, and versatility of the ‘net but believes journalists should still check their facts, give folks in the hot seat their say, and think before they hit Send. He’ll write about local and national topics.\n\nDave is currently senior reporter for WHYY, and a contributor and fill-in host for Fresh Air with Terry Gross. He was a reporter and columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News for 19 years, and before that was city hall bureau chief for KYW News Radio and city hall correspondent for WHYY.\n\nHe’s a Texas native who’s spent his working life in Philadelphia. Before getting into journalism, he worked as a teacher, cab driver, and welder."
