        "text": "The younger of the Kinks brothers, guitarist Dave Davies, was born on this day in 1947 in North London. With six other siblings under the roof of their childhood home, Ray and Dave needed to vie for attention. The sibling rivalry that developed between the two of them continued for decades and was largely the undoing of the Kinks. Dave and Pete Quaife started the band in 1963. Ray, who was more outgoing and diplomatic, soon joined and became recognized as the leader of the band and a referee in the frequent fights his brother and drummer Mick Avory got into, one of which resulted in Dave needing to get a gash in his head stitched-up after an on stage fracas the two got into during a 1965 concert in Wales.\n\nThe Kinks broke-up in the mid 90's. Sporadic attempts by one or the other brother to sort things out so they could work together again only led to one collaboration, a one song performance at the end of 2015 in London, but Ray says he and Dave have had recent success writing together for a potential album and that Avory might get brought in on it, too.\n\nOther Noteworthy Classic Rock events on February 3 include...\n\n1942 Early Hollies bassist Eric Haydock born.\n\n1949 New York Dolls bass player Arthur Kane born.\n\n1966 Beach Boy Carl Wilson marries Annie Hinsche.\n\n1967 Jimi Hendrix records Purple Haze in London.\n\n1976 David Bowie opens US tour in Seattle.\n\n1968 The Beatles record early takes of Lady Madonna.\n\n1976 David Bowie opens a US tour in Seattle.\n\n1977 Elton John ends announced retirement from playing live after 15 months with a concert in Sweden.\n\n1985 Firm, the group Paul Rodgers and Jimmy Page formed, release Mean Business.\n\n1992 Pearl Jam makes UK live debut in Southern, England.\n\n1996 The Ramones announce the end of the road for them as a band.\n\n1997 David Bowie releases Earthlings.\n\n1998 Pearl Jam releases Yield.\n\n2003 Producer Phil Spector arrested and charged in the murder of actress Lana Clarkson.\n\n2004 Cornelius Bumpus of the Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan dies of a heart attack at 58 before plane he's a passenger on is able to make an emergency landing in Sioux City, Iowa."
