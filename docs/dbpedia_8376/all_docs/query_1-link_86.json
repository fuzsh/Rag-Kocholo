        "text": "Senior Reporter and Host, \"The Source,\" \"Texas Matters\"\n\ndmdavies@tpr.org\n\nTwitter: @DavidMartinDavi\n\nDavid Martin Davies is a veteran journalist with more than 30 years of experience covering Texas, the border and Mexico.\n\nDavies is the host of \"The Source,\" an hour-long live call-in news program that airs on KSTX at noon Monday through Thursday. Since 1999 he was been the host and producer of \"Texas Matters,\" a weekly radio news magazine and podcast that looks at the issues, events and people in the Lone Star State.\n\nDavies' reporting has been featured on National Public Radio, American Public Media's \"Marketplace\" and the BBC. He has written for The San Antonio Light, The San Antonio Express-News, The Texas Observer and other publications.\n\nHis reporting has been recognized with numerous awards. In 2022,2021 and 2020 Davies was recognized with first place awards for News/Public Affairs by the Public Media Journalists Association.\n\nIn 2019 Davies was honored with a National Edward R. Murrow Award for his radio documentary exposing human sex trafficking. Davies was also awarded in 2019 by the Public Radio News Directors Inc. for best talk show. Davies was named the 2008 Texas Radio Journalist of the Year by the Houston Press Club. In 2019 he was recognized with a First Amendment Awards by the Fort Worth Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. The Association for Women in Communications San Antonio Professional Chapter honored Davies with the 2015 Edna McGaffey Media Excellence Headliner Award.\n\nDavies is the author and creator of the comic \"San Antonio Secret History.\" He is the co-author of the book \"San Antonio 365\"\n\nToday on Texas Matters. How Texas public school curriculum could be teaching Christianity. In Texas It will be harder to vote in this presidential election than it was four years ago. And how Arkansans are fighting to put abortion on their ballot.\n\nWhen was the last time you topped off that backyard bird feeder? San Antonio’s climate and its growing urban footprint can mean bird feeding is a needed benefit for the local avian population. What are the best practices for bird feeding? What bird do you see chowing down at your feeder?\n\nHow crazy has this presidential election become? With dramatic ups and downs. It's become a thrill ride that won't end until Nov 5. We get analysis with Matthew Dowd, an American political pundit and consultant.\n\nAnti-government protests continue in Venezuela in the aftermath of the nation’s July 28 sham presidential election. There is a call for a global protest against President Nicolás Maduro for this Saturday August 17.\n\nThere are six finalized proposed city charter amendments on the ballot this November.\n\nAs San Antonio's City Council is preparing to decide if downtown horse carriages should be banned, it's worth noting the horse's long journey with mankind. Timothy C. Winegard is the author of \"The Horse: A galloping history of humanity.\"The horse's evolutionary history, its indispensable role in human development, and its enduring cultural significance make it a subject worthy of study and appreciation.\n\nHow secret is the ballot in Texas? A voter fraud conspiracy advocate says she's cracked the code of the Texas secret ballot. And as the school year starts, will an uncertified teacher be assigned to your child's classroom? A new study shows it could mean a four-month loss of academic progress.\n\nForty-six percent of households in Bexar County earn less than what is required to make ends meet in the current economy. This means that 345,000 households in Bexar County earn wages below the cost of living. That’s according to a report by The United Way of San Antonio. Why are so many families living with financial hardship? How are they getting by? What can be done to improve their situations?\n\nHow do we understand the utilization—and weaponization—of charm in contemporary global politics? Leaders gifted with natural charm and magnetism often hold an undeniable allure that can significantly impact diplomatic efforts. If we do not understand charm’s political power, we cannot grasp today’s fragile political moment.\n\nThere are about 17,000 Border Patrol agents stationed along the U.S. Mexico border. Each has a gun and a badge but there are some who fail in their task to protect their communities."
