He was knighted in 2017.\n\nIn 2023, The Kinks began a celebration of their 60-year career with two box sets The Journey – Part 1 and The Journey – Part 2, featuring songs handpicked by members of the band, including singles, B-sides, album tracks and live performances.\n\nHappy 80th birthday Ray!\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.
