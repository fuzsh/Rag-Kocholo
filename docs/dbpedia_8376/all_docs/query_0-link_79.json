A magical evening that has stayed with me to this day. Highlight of the gig was 'Halcyon On and On'.\n\nWhich British subculture means the most to you?\n\nFor me, it was the underground electronic music scene in London in the 90s.\n\nAn era of musical influence that still plays a large part in my life.\n\nWhat music did you listen to growing up?\n\nAs a young teen it was the hip-hop/rap of the times like Snoop and Dre, and also heavy guitar bands like Metallica, Guns and Roses and Nirvana. This was all before getting into electronic music.\n\nRuss Davies is well known in the global electronic dance music scene, having produced over 15 albums and toured worldwide as his alter-ego's Abakus and Cinnamon Chasers.\n\nRuss's latest album 'Open Road' was released in March 2017 and was a collaboration with his father and guitarist for The Kinks, Dave Davies.\n\nWhat was the first song you played on repeat?\n\nProbably Billy Idol 'White Wedding'...
