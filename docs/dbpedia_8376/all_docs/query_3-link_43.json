From 1982 to 1986, Davies was a reporter for WHYY covering local issues and filing reports for NPR. He also edited a community newspaper in Philadelphia and has worked as a teacher, a cab driver and a welder.\n\nDavies is a graduate of the University of Texas.\n\nOver the course of his decades-long career in public health, Fauci vowed he would never shy away from speaking the truth with the U.S. president— even when it was inconvenient. Fauci's memoir is On Call.\n\nTime correspondent Simon Shuster says Zelenskyy is \"almost unrecognizable\" from the happy-go-lucky, optimistic comedian he first met in 2019. Shuster's new book is The Showman.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor is seeking out the next generation of filmmakers because, he says, many established directors have \"already made up their minds about me.\" Cage's new movie is Dream Scenario.\n\nIn his film The League, Sam Pollard tells the story of the Negro National League: \"They brought a different kind of style ... a kind of baseball which Major League Baseball is trying to bring back.\"\n\nConstitutional lawyer Michael Waldman says there's a growing divide between the electorate and the Court: \"the country is moving in one direction ... the Court is moving fast in another direction.\"\n\nFrom excessive hygiene to low-fiber diets, author Theresa MacPhail explores the deep-rooted causes of rising allergy rates in her new book Allergic.\n\nShe was about 3 years old and had stuck raisins up her nose — but she made her mom laugh so she calls it a win. The Veep star plays a writer whose husband hates her new novel in You Hurt My Feelings.\n\nPsychologist James Jackson says people with long COVID experience impaired brain function and mental health issues. He offers some practical advice and support in his new book, Clearing the Fog.\n\nPublic health professor Arline Geronimus explains how marginalized people suffer nearly constant stress, which damages their bodies at the cellular level. Her new book is Weathering.\n\nPoverty, by America author Matthew Desmond says if the top 1% of Americans paid the taxes they owed, it would raise $175 billion each year: \"That is just about enough to pull everyone out of poverty.\""
