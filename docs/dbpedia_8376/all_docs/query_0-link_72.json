        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n26 Jul 2022, 15:40\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nFans of The Kinks are hopeful that the band will reunite, after Dave Davies said he is \"optimistic\" about getting the band back together.\n\nDavies has just released a book called 'Living on a Thin Line'.\n\nWhile interviewing to promote the book, Dave said he hopes he and his brother, Sir Ray Davies, can put the past behind them to reform.\n\nHe told The Independent: “I hope so! I do. Ray and I have spoken about it – it’s possible!”\n\n“We get on okay,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked what they talk about, he replied: “We talk about football! We’re born-and-bred Arsenal fans … So, yeah, I’m optimistic about the future.”\n\nHe continued: “I grew up in the music business, and it’s insane. We have to touch madness to draw from it, and it stimulates us as well as driving us mad. Maybe real truth is inside that madness somewhere.”\n\nDave admitted to catching up with his brother over a drink back in December 2020, and Ray previously said on TV that the band had been back in the studio for the first time in 25 years.\n\nDave disputed it, saying they had only talked about it.\n\nDave spilled: \"I thought, 'What is Ray bulls****** about now?'\"\n\nHowever, he added: \"We've been talking about maybe trying to work on new Kinks material.\n\n\"I said, 'We shouldn't go public yet because we've got to iron out a few things.'\n\n\"He said, 'Yeah.' Of course, he left, and the next thing he's on TV saying we're doing it. Typical Ray.\""
