He was the youngest brother of Ray Davies and would be the lead guitarist in The Kinks alongside his brother. Growing up, he and his siblings (he was 1 of 8 children, with he and Ray being the only boys) there would be large parties in the Davies household with the boy’s parents singing and playing piano to entertain guests. Dave would start out playing skiffle, but soon moved into rock. While still enjoying success as a member of The Kinks, Dave released the single ‘Death Of A Clown’ which he saw go to number 3 in the UK. A second solo single, ‘Suzannah’s Still Alive’ would give him a number 20 hit. Both of these were in 1967 and, despite releasing further solo material, he would not see any make the UK charts. He would not have any solo chart success in the US.\n\nHits as a member of The Kinks:\n\nTotal chart involvement:"
