        "text": "Welcome to the home of British music producer and composer Russ Davies and his electronica alter-egos Cinnamon Chasers, Abakus & Aiiso. Russ brings together a diverse range of methodologies and genres into his modern compositions, from experimental electronica, songwriting through to modern film composition. His music has been commissioned for numerous tv, film and game placements for clients BBC, Amazon, Sony Playstation, Calvin Klein, Spotify, Castrol Oil, Vanity Fair, Avon and many more.\n\nRuss grew up in north London and is the son of Dave Davies of England rock band The Kinks. He started creating electronic music at 13 years old using an Amiga500 computer and 8-bit tracking software and Akai samplers, and his influences during this period was 90s electronic rave music, indie-rock and horror-action movies of the era.\n\nIn 2003 his debut album as Abakus was signed to producer Youth's (Killing Joke, The Verve, The Orb) LSD records, in partnership with Jazz Summers Biglife management. The album That Much Closer To The Sun garnered popularity within the psychedelic electronic music scene, taking him touring worldwide, and remixing acts including The Orb, Perishers and Roxy Music. His music as Abakus has appeared on Virgin Records, Cocoon Records, Ministry Of Sound, Juno Records, and Bhudda Bar.\n\nIn 2009 Russ saw an opportunity for a new sound and expression in the melodic genres of nu-disco and nostalgic-electro and created a new alias Cinnamon Chasers as an outlet for his love of melody, classic synthesisers and drum machines. Under this alias Russ released the album A Million Miles From Home which featured the hit Luv Deluxe - which went on to win an award at SXSW for best music video after garnering millions of plays on youtube and vimeo. Both his projects, Abakus & Cinnamon Chasers, kept him busy in the studio and on the road, continuing to release numerous successful albums and EPs.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017 Russ co-wrote and produced the critically acclaimed album Open Road, together with his father Dave Davies. In this period Russ also signed his new electronica alter-ego Aiiso to Anjunadeep Records, and as Aiiso subsequently had tracks featured on two iTunes #1 albums.\n\nRuss’ work as a film composer began with the short film Controller, directed by Saman Kesh, which featured a hybrid electronic-orchestral score. From here he went on to score the BBC1 series The War Of The Worlds, which was aired 2019, directed by Craig Viveiros, and in 2020/2021 composed the score for BBC-America’s The Watch.\n\nPress Quotes\n\n-------------------------\n\n\"Magic carpet ride\" – Earmilk.com\n\n\"One of my favourites of all time\" - Indie Shuffle\n\n\"Diversity and passion for electronic music are oozing out of the seems of this immensely prolific and gifted writer.\" - The Untz\n\n\"Possess' that unique quality only a few producers can replicate...for a late night drive when your contemplating what to do with your entire life\" - Beatific\n\n\"fusion of Aeroplane, Friendly Fires, Kris Menace and Alan Braxe, with a dash of Vangelis and Jean Michel Jarre thrown in\" – juno.co.uk\n\n\"Perfect Dreamy Summer Soundscape\" - BBC Radio\n\n\"Themes and sounds so epic that it nearly defies all definition.
