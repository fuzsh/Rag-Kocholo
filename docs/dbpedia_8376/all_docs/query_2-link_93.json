In early 1964 they made a debut record of two numbers, released also in the U.S. with no big success, but later in the year they made a major hit that was a top seller on two continents, \"You Really Got Me.\" The Kinks entered the Rock'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nThe son of a London suburbs gardener and a housewife, he began performing rhythm and blues in local pubs at 13 along with Ray, 16. Three years later they formed a bank called the \"Bo Weevils,\" then the \"Ravens,\" singing Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters classics. They became a hot act at society parties with their wild raging sound and long hair. Someone called Ray a \"kink\" as a put-down and the name stuck. In 1964 they recorded their first album and began to stage their truly raucous international concert tours, an onstage rowdiness that often incited the audience to riot. They were barred from Scandinavia, and from the U.S. 1966-'68.\n\nThe spats between the two brothers were much publicized. Dave periodically rebelled against Ray's domination of the Kinks and there has been fistfights, angry stage exits and furious trashings of expensive equipment.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nbusiness associate/partner relationship with Avory, Mick (born 15 February 1944)\n\nbusiness associate/partner relationship with Davies, Ray (born 21 June 1944)\n\nbusiness associate/partner relationship with Rodford, Jim (born 7 July 1941)\n\nSource Notes\n\nDebbi Kempton-Smith quotes his mom\n\nCategories\n\nFamily : Childhood : Sibling circumstances (Spats with brother Ray)\n\nVocation : Entertainment : Child performer (Pro at 13)\n\nVocation : Entertain/Music : Group/ Duo (Kinks)\n\nVocation : Entertain/Music : Instrumentalist (Guitar)"
