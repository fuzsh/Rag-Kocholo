        "text": "Dave Davies was seventeen when he recorded \"You Really Got Me.\" With the British Invasion in full swing, the precocious teenager was thrown into the storm. In an instant, he had it allâ€”hit records, fame, adoring fans, even an older brother in his band. But all was not well. Living a Bacchus-like life in Swinging London, Dave Davies was haunted by ghosts from his past and an unshakeable longing. When he had his own hit single at age twenty-one, a solo career appeared on the horizon. Two years later, the Kinks had become a commercial disaster and the guitarist's own solo career fizzled. In the 1960s and '70s, Dave Davies recorded an arsenal of songs both with the Kinks and on his own, yet they remained unreleased for decades. This is the story of Dave Davies's life and music. It is a story of great excess, great loss, and a spiritual journey."
