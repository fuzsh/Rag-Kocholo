        "text": "Dave Davies recalls the making of 1970's \"Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One\" as a period of transition for the Kinks, who were \"forging ahead\" into a future whose trajectory they couldn't quite make out on the horizon.\n\n\"We didn’t know where we were going,\" the guitarist says. \"But it seemed like it might be a good place.\"\n\nAs it turns out, \"Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One\" took the Kinks to a very good place in the U.S., where it managed to become the band's highest-charting studio release since 1964's \"You Really Got Me,\" a debut whose U.S. pressing shared a title with their breakthrough single.\n\nThe album, whose 50th anniversary is being celebrated with a series of deluxe reissues, including a box set packed with outtakes, remixes and other special features, peaked at No. 35.\n\nIt didn't hurt that by the time of the album's release the Kinks had done some reconnecting with their U.S. fans after the lifting of a touring ban that kept them from performing in the States from 1966 until a string of dates in 1969 in support of a concept album called \"Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire).\"\n\nThe ban was the result of a dispute with the American Federation of Musicians, who refused the Kinks' permit requests for what was widely attributed at the time to their rowdy behavior onstage.\n\nAs Davies recalls their return to the States, \"It was a very special time.\"\n\n'Lola,' the single, was a big hit for the Kinks\n\nAn even bigger factor in the album's impact on their U.S. comeback was undoubtedly the inclusion of \"Lola,\" a playful account of a night spent dancing with a cross-dresser in London's Soho district.\n\n\"Lola\" peaked at No. 9, their highest U.S. entry on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1965, when \"Tired of Waiting for You\" became their third consecutive release to crack the Top 10 at the height of the British Invasion. It followed \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night.\"\n\nDavies says of the song, \"I thought people might like it, because Ray wrote this really catchy hook.\"\n\nRay Davies is the lead guitarist's older brother whose narrative gifts and sense of humor were both used to brilliant effect in the writing of \"Lola,\" whose simple chorus hook was custom-made for singalongs.\n\nIn the final verse, the singer brings the story to a playfully ambiguous conclusion with \"Well I'm not the world's most masculine man / But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man/ And so is Lola.\"\n\n\"The humor is kind of a little bit hidden in the story,\" Davies says. \"A lot of people missed the point of it. The thinking part of the audience knew what it was about but the singing-along part, it went over — or under — people’s heads.\"\n\nHe met a guy a few years back, he says, who used to cover \"Lola\" in the type of bands you might find in the lounge at a Holiday Inn.\n\n\"And he used to do 'Lola' every night for years,\" Davies recalls, with a laugh. \"Until he found out what it was about. Then, he stopped playing it. But how can you not know what it’s about if you’re singing it?!\"\n\nHow the group used humor to deal with the music business\n\nThere's no shortage of humor on \"Lola Versus Powerman,\" but that's to be expected when you're dealing with the Kinks.\n\nAs Davies says, \"A prevalent energy in the Kinks has been humor. And it's served us well, I think.\"\n\nOn this album, that humor is frequently used to balance out the disillusionment that underscores their songs about the music business, fueled by problems with their management and publishers.\n\n\"The Kinks historically had problems with the music business,\" Davies says. \"It’s almost like we didn’t want to be in it but we just loved music so much. There’s some really lovely people in music but also some really dodgy characters.\"\n\nWith its chorus of \"Let's all sit and watch the money-go-round/ And everyone take a little bit here and a little bit there,\" the song \"Moneygoround\" exemplifies a lot of what the Kinks were dealing with at the point.\n\nAs Davies says of the song, \"It’s done in kind of an amusing way with its jingly piano but it's also quite bitter, quite angry. Sometimes humor helps cover over the cracks.\"\n\nThe Davies brothers grew up in north London\n\nThat's something he and Ray learned growing up in the London suburb, Muswell Hill, the youngest of eight children born to working-class parents.\n\n\"When things are bad, Ray and I have always had this kind of telepathy,\" he says.\n\n\"And humor was a great way for us to share experiences and comment on our world. It’s a frightening world, especially now. I feel so sorry for young people growing up. Hopefully, they’re a lot brighter than we were. But humor always helped me and Ray.\"\n\nThe \"Lola\" album also features several of the Davies brothers' more reflective moments, from Ray's \"This Time Tomorrow\" to Dave's \"Strangers.\"\n\n\"I think we were all going through, asking ourselves questions about where we are, what are we doing,\" Davies says. \"So that was very much reflected in 'Strangers,' that we kind of have to help each other, really.\"\n\nDave Davies came of age while the Kinks were taking off\n\nThe guitarist, who turned 17 the year the Kinks released \"You Really Got Me,\" says the writing of \"Strangers\" was the product of a heavy emotional time in his life.\n\n\"I had to grow up in the music business, which is a bit bizarre, really, because you grow up in such a different way,\" he says.\n\n\"So I was going through a lot of inner turmoil. Why am I here? What am I doing? What are any of us doing? It seemed a way to answer those questions was maybe we need to pull together more and galvanize what we’ve got to move on as a band, as a team. \"\n\nThat's what \"Strangers\" is really about, he says, \"connecting in a deeper way with the people around us and the new people we meet. I felt I showed a bit of myself I hadn’t shown before in that song.\"\n\nDave Davies' other contributions to the album, \"Rats,\" is based on how he feels about the music business\n\n\"Do another single, another album, people climbing over each other to find success,\" he says. \"It’s a nightmarish scenario, really, being in the music business. I’ve never really felt at home. But once you get on stage and connect, you’re home.\"\n\n\"Rats\" is one of several tracks that make the \"Lola\" album rock a good deal more than the efforts leading up to it: \"Something Else By the Kinks,\" \"The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society\" and \"Arthur.\"\n\n\"I think what helped was going back to America, touring again and being live,\" Davies says of the overall feel of the album.\n\n\"Getting back on stage in a real rock ‘n’ roll environment helped with that more rocking element. But Kinks music is about so many different types of music, from Hank Williams-influenced country to Eddie Cochran and Chuck Berry to music hall, like ‘South Pacific and Oklahoma,' stuff like that.\"\n\nAnother key ingredient in the sound of \"Lola Versus Powerman\" was the elder Davies' use of a National resonator guitar, or dobro. The instrument's distinctive character can be heard on \"Lola\" and a second charting single from the album, \"Apeman.\"\n\nDavies is a big fan of the album's more electrifying, guitar-heavy rockers, from \"Rats\" to \"Powerman.\"\n\nThe Kinks against the world\n\n\"It's an us against the world thing,\" Davies says of the \"Powerman\" lyrics. \"'Strangers' is like that, too. Let’s pull together and keep fighting.\"\n\nThat \"us against the world thing\" has played a huge role in establishing the Kinks as the beloved underdogs who refuse to join any club that would have them as a member.\n\n\"There’s always that kind of back story to the Kinks,\" Davies says.\n\n\"We never really joined the ‘club’ in the music business. We were always outsiders, with one foot in and one foot out. We never really fit in with the trends.\"\n\nThe younger Davies often brings the conversation back around to the importance of connection, whether in the context of his oft-strained but seemingly strong at the moment relations with his brother or the uncommonly powerful connection they've built with their audience.\n\n\"They become immediate close friends in a way,\" Davies says of their fans.\n\n\"That's always been a special little thing about the Kinks and their relationship with the audience. When a person gets it, it’s different — when they really get what the Kinks mean, emotionally.\"\n\nAre they looking to release new music any time soon?\n\nAs for his own relationship with Ray, the brothers have been working on new music fans are hoping will become the Kinks' first studio release since 1993.\n\nFans also know it would be wrong to hold one's breath waiting for that.\n\nAs Davies sums up the progress they've managed to make, \"We've worked on a couple ideas for songs, and there’s old demos that need fixing up, but it’s nothing that we feel is right to present just yet. It might still happen, but &mldr; we’ll see.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the brothers did work closely on the 50th anniversary edition of \"Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Vol. One,\" recording a series of conversations about the writing of the album in Ray's kitchen.\n\n\"It was nice,\" Davies says. \"It reminded me of when we were kids because in that funny little house in Muswell Hill, we used to do everything in the kitchen — love, cry, get married, eat, drink. So it seemed quite appropriate.\"\n\nNot every conversation made the album.\n\n\"There’s so much stuff we cut out,\" Davies says, \"shouting ‘Oh no, that didn’t happen.’ ‘Yeah, it did.’ And you cry. When you revisit all these emotions after all these years, there’s a lot to deal with emotionally.\"\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.
