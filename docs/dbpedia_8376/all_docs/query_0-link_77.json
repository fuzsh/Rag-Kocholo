        "text": "Sometime in early 1963 Ray Davies met London blues impresario and musician, Alexis Korner. The nature of the meeting was probably Davies looking for work, but a result was that he became involved in London's R&B scene. Ray had been playing both with brother Dave's band, the Ravens, and with a blues group, Dave Hunt Band. When Quaife and Avory joined, the Kinks were born. Robert Wace, a Cliff Richard wannabe, promoted himself to the band as a singer with connections and, for a brief period, functioned as the band's lead singer. However, he found it easier getting them gigs than surviving them and, thus, became their manager. Wace convinced a London entertainment fixture, Larry Page, to record a 5-song demo of the band. The demo landed them a contract with Pye Records through American producer Shel Talmy in this year of beat hysteria. Talmy (a school chum of Phil Spector) was originally from Los Angeles, but had moved to London in the early sixties where American producers were rare, partially reviled and also much sought after as masters of pop magic."
