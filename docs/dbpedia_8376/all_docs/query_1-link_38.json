        "text": "David Russell Gordon Davies (born February 3, 1947) is a singer and guitarist with the British rock band The Kinks, which he founded with his brother Ray in 1963. Although he has never attained the fame and reputation of his older brother, who wrote most of the Kinks' songs, he wrote and had some solo hits (notably Death of a Clown) and continues to have a steady musical career as a performer and songwriter."
