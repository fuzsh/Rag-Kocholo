        "text": "Latest version: 4.70\n\nVirtual Audio Cable (VAC) is an audio bridge between applications that transmits sounds (audio streams) from app to app, from device to device.\n\nVAC creates a set of virtual audio devices. Each device simulates an audio adapter (usually named a \"card\") whose output is internally connected to the input, making an audio loopback. If an application plays audio to the output of such device, the sound will not be audible because the signal is looped back to the input. But if another application records from the input, it receives the sound produced by the first app.\n\nSuch virtual devices are named Virtual Cables. The term \"Virtual Cable\" is used only in the description of VAC product, as a placeholder. Actual names of virtual audio devices/endpoints that you will see in applications' menus, are different (for example, \"Line 1\", \"Line 2\" etc.).\n\nEach side of any Virtual Cable can be used by several audio apps at the same time. If two or more apps play sounds to the same playback endpoint, these sounds are mixed, and the result is transmitted to the recording side. It two or more apps record from the same endpoint, each app gets a copy of the sound.\n\nTherefore, each Virtual Cable acts as a \"meeting point\" or a \"logistics hub\" for the applications.\n\nVAC delivers audio signals completely inside the computer. No audio hardware is required (VAC can be used on a virtual server with no audio adapter).\n\nThere is no quality loss (if no format conversion and/or volume control are involved). If all these conditions are met, audio transfer is bitperfect, suitable for audiophile applications. In well-tuned systems, signal latency is very low.\n\nTo transfer/route audio signals from an endpoint (device) to another, VAC offers Audio Repeater application:\n\nWarning: in the Internet, there are several other products using the name \"Virtual Audio Cable\". Some of them use this name just for promotional purposes, but some others are completely fake and contain malware. If you decide to try them, don't forget to check their sites/binaries with anti-malware software/services.\n\nApplicability\n\nUse VAC with the following audio applications and application classes:\n\nInternet Telephony/VoIP/SIP/voice messengers (Skype, Discord, Ventrilo, MicroSIP).\n\nLive mixing/DJ (vMix, Mixxx, VirtualDJ, VoiceMeeter Banana/Potato).\n\nLive broadcasting (Open Broadcaster/OBS Studio, WireCast, VidBlasterX. SAM Broadcaster).\n\nSpeech synthesis/recognition (Google Text-to-Speech/Speech-to-Text, Dragon Naturally Speaking).\n\nSoftware synthesizers and studio/DAW (Ableton, Acid, AudioMulch, Band-in-a-Box, Bidule, Cakewalk/Sonar, Cubase, FL Studio, GarageBand, Logic, MiniMoog, n-Track, Nuendo, Reaktor, REAPER, Reason, Samplitude, Traktor, Vegas).\n\nAudio editors/recorders (Audacity, Adobe Audition, GoldWave, WaveLab, Sound Forge).\n\nVirtual Machines (VMware Player/Workstation, VirtualBox, Hyper-V).\n\nAmateur and software-defined radio (Flex Radio, PowerSDR, HAM Radio Deluxe, HamSphere, HDSDR, Fldigi, SDR-Radio, WSJT-X, JTDX).\n\nAudio application development - watch the application's audio operations, check audio data played, supply with specific data to be recorded etc.\n\nCompatibility\n\nVAC works in Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 11.\n\nNo obsessive activity\n\nVAC just performs things what it is intended for: passes audio streams between applications, converting audio formats if necessary. It never guides you to advertising pages, nor pops up busily on the screen, nor installs hidden activities in your system. VAC does only actions that you explicitly demand for.\n\nData policy\n\nVAC driver and the supplied applications can only collect and use information directly related to their functionality. For example, VAC driver can query processor functions to optimize performance, request process/thread information to display it in a log, Audio Repeater applications request audio device/endpoint properties, etc. Since they do not work with personal, business, geographical, economic or political data, they do not access such data sources at all.\n\nVAC driver and the supplied applications do not access network functions at all. Thus, it is technically impossible for them to send or receive data over a network, whether local or global.\n\nCustom versions and source code\n\nCustom versions and source code options are available for application developers.\n\nOlder versions"
