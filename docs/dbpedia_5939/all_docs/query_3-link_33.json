        "text": "PrivadoVPN is a solid free VPN for casual users who want to stream movies and TV shows, browse the web with basic privacy or travel. It might not be a household name like NordVPN -- which you’ve likely seen banner ads for -- or our best overall ExpressVPN, but Privado’s free plan especially is a compelling choice for streaming or general web browsing. While I appreciated its wallet-friendly monthly, annual and two-year plans, Privado’s free tier proved an exceptional alternative to Proton’s no-cost option. To assess PrivadoVPN, I ran over 250 internet speed tests, tried it on dozens of devices and streamed hours of videos. In my testing, I found Privado adept at streaming and easy enough to use.\n\nThe no-frills VPN doesn’t get you blazing-fast speeds, an exhaustive server network or advanced privacy features. The apps work fine but could use some refinement. Because of its shortcomings -- Privado has a strict no-logs policy but hasn’t been audited -- I wouldn’t recommend Privado for folks with serious privacy needs, like political activists, investigative journalists or paranoid torrent users. Nonetheless, it’s one of the best free VPNs on the market, and a paid plan could make sense as an upgrade path if you need more servers or additional bandwidth per month but don’t want to go through the hassle of switching VPN providers. Let’s look at Privado’s speeds, streaming service unblocking, privacy and more so you can see if this is the right virtual private network for your needs.\n\nPrivadoVPN speed: Spotty speeds for everyday use depending on the protocol and device\n\nAverage speed loss: 48%\n\nNumber of servers: Hundreds\n\nNumber of countries: 49\n\nAll VPNs slow down your internet speeds somewhat because your data takes an indirect route, bouncing off of at least one virtual private network server before reaching its destination. In my testing, the fastest VPNs -- including NordVPN, Mullvad and Surfshark -- drop your internet download speeds by an average of just 25% or less. PrivadoVPN’s average 48% internet download speed loss was underwhelming, clocking in the same ballpark as PIA and IPVanish.\n\nIn real-world applications, like watching 4K movies on Netflix or streaming music on Spotify, I didn’t notice much difference thanks to my snappy Google Fiber speeds (300Mbps on Wi-Fi, 1Gbps over Ethernet). For reference, Netflix recommends a minimum 15Mbps internet download speed to stream 4K ultra high-definition videos. Most folks with a fast connection -- think fiber, cable or even a reliable 5G signal -- should be fine, but if you’re using satellite internet or fixed wireless, I’d suggest a faster VPN like Nord or Surfshark.\n\nSpeed tests varied wildly based on operating system and VPN protocol\n\nAlthough its overall internet download speed performance was lackluster, connectivity varied drastically by VPN protocol -- in some cases perplexingly so. Typically, OpenVPN is marginally more secure but slower than WireGuard, and I’ve noticed minor differences in speed based on the operating system while benchmarking. Privado proved unreliable in some cases.\n\nI was blown away by its excellent 9.6% average download speed loss with OpenVPN on Windows, and its 38.8% average speed reduction on MacOS with WireGuard was fine. The 52.3% speed loss in Windows with WireGuard was the opposite of what I expected because it was meaningfully slower than its OpenVPN counterpart. Even stranger, the 91.5% internet speed loss on MacOS with OpenVPN was alarmingly high.\n\nIn fairness, I got noticeably faster, albeit still disappointing, speeds on US servers with WireGuard on Windows, which makes sense. Normally, you’ll get faster speeds when tunneling through geographically closer servers. Nevertheless, the 41.3% average speed loss on WireGuard US New York servers was slower than I predicted. I don’t have an explanation for its astronomical MacOS OpenVPN speed loss. It could be overloaded servers or any number of issues.\n\nI contacted Privado for further insight, and they emailed me that “Speed tests involve many variables, making consistent insights challenging. Generally, Wireguard is fast because it's lightweight, but real-world experiences can vary.” Privado recommended that users try different server locations and VPN protocols to determine the best performance -- a sentiment I generally agree with, even though I’d still like to see its baseline speeds on certain protocols improve in the future.\n\nI didn’t notice any buffering, stuttering or slow-loading web pages, but that’s likely because of my already fast internet speeds. PrivadoVPN’s paid plan is tough to recommend over other budget picks like Surfshark considering its high internet speed loss.\n\nPrivadoVPN has a modest server network\n\nPrivadoVPN provides hundreds of servers in 49 countries on its paid plans. By contrast, our top-recommended VPNs -- including ExpressVPN, NordVPN, ProtonVPN and Surfshark -- offer thousands of servers across 100-plus countries. IPVanish is more in line with Privado, with a presence in 56 countries, although IPVanish’s overall server count is much higher at more than 2,400. Considering its slim server network, Privado might not be ideal for travel, although it covers a modest number of international locations.\n\nThe free PrivadoVPN tier is a neat option that lets you access 13 different international servers, including locations in the US, UK, Canada, France, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. That’s more countries than Proton’s free plan, which features only five. Additionally, Privado’s no-cost service lets you pick the server you’re using, whereas Proton’s free plan doesn’t. Although the paid PrivadoVPN server network isn’t the largest, its free server roster is pretty beefy.\n\nKey takeaway: PrivadoVPN isn’t the fastest VPN and doesn’t deliver the largest web of servers on its paid plan; the free tier gives you a great lineup of international servers to choose from.\n\nValue: PrivadoVPN is easy on the pocketbook, and its free plan is one of the best in the game\n\nPrice: $11 per month, $45 for the first year or $54 total for the first two years (the one-year plan renews at $60 while the two-year plan renews at $96 total for two years of service)\n\nMoney-back guarantee: 30-day money-back guarantee\n\nPayment options: Credit card/debit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin), UnionPay, Mint and dozens of other options\n\nAvailable apps: Windows, MacOS, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Amazon Fire TV, Linux, routers\n\nPrivadoVPN’s promotional pricing makes it a decent value. Although its monthly plan sets you back about the same price as most of its competitors, the annual and two-year tiers undercut most rivals. Express costs $100 annually, Nord is $60 for the first year or $82 for the first two years and Proton is $60 for the first year or $108 for the first two years.\n\nComparing Privado to other cheap VPNs, like Surfshark and PIA is a different story. PIA costs less for its one- and three-year plans ($40 and $79 respectively) than Privado’s while offering a much larger server network. Surfshark’s confusingly expensive $15.45 monthly plan aside, its promotional $44 annual price is slightly lower than PrivadoVPN and its $60 two-year package is marginally more costly. Like Privado, Surfshark has price hikes, renewing at $60 per 12-months for its one- and two-year plans. Both Surfshark and PIA cost around the same price as Privado but offer more extensive server networks. As paid plans go, PrivadoVPN is attractively priced, making it an acceptable option for casual VPN users who want essential privacy while web browsing or need to unblock region-restricted streaming services. PIA is even cheaper, while Surfshark gives you significantly better value for slightly more money, so most folks are better off with one of those options.\n\nPrivadoVPN boasts a compelling free plan\n\nMost free VPN plans should be avoided like the plague. ProtonVPN is one of the few no-cost VPNs that proves the exception to that rule. Likewise, I was impressed with Privado’s zero-dollar tier. Granted, Privado’s free plan limits you to servers in 13 cities and you can only use it on one device at a time. Whereas Proton’s zero-cost plan offers unlimited usage but doesn’t let you manually pick what server you connect to, Privado provides a 10GB monthly data limit while letting you choose any of its 13 servers.\n\nIt’s a trade-off: Proton touts unrestricted use, but you can’t select a server, while Privado lets you hop on whatever server you like with a data cap. I find the ability to choose a server more useful, but this boils down to personal preference. Go with Proton if you want a higher data cap, or stick with Privado for more server flexibility.\n\nThe PrivadoVPN app is fairly simple to use, with one puzzling exception\n\nThe PrivadoVPN app is mostly easy to use. It worked well on my Android phone and iPad as on my Windows and MacOS machines. For streaming, I enjoyed kicking back on the sofa to unblock foreign Netflix libraries on my Amazon Fire TV Stick and Android TV-based Chromecast with Google TV. Unfortunately, there’s no Apple TV app yet, although Privado told me via email that it’s working on one.\n\nIn my experience, the PrivadoVPN app is fairly universal across most devices. It’s pretty intuitive, with a streamlined interface that features a prominent \"on\" button similar to ExpressVPN -- although not quite as slick. While the Privado app is fairly barebones, it features the basics, including a kill switch, split tunneling and even some basic threat protection options. There are some nice touches, like clear explanations of the pros and cons of each VPN protocol helpfully listed in the app. When navigating into the settings menu to change protocols, you’ll see concise descriptions of the different protocols -- like “protect your privacy with the highest level of encryption” for OpenVPN. Because VPN apps can be pretty cumbersome for newcomers, I like how this thoughtful design lowers the learning curve.\n\nSplit tunneling worked well -- I installed Spider-Man Remastered in Steam without using a VPN for the fastest possible download speeds while streaming Abbott Elementary on Disney Plus with a VPN. Likewise, the kill switch mainly functioned as expected, preventing my IP address from leaking during an unexpected internet outage. Bewilderingly, the kill switch functions across your entire device, meaning that even manually disconnecting from a server or exiting out of the PrivadoVPN app altogether with the kill switch toggled on prevents you from accessing the internet at all. The only workarounds are toggling the kill switch off when you’re done using a VPN or leaving it permanently disabled.\n\nPrivadoVPN’s apps are pretty user-friendly, making everything from hopping on a server to picking a VPN protocol simple enough. The overly protective kill switch could be overhauled to be less intrusive and more practical.\n\nPrivado does a solid job with streaming service geo-unblocking\n\nPrivadoVPN is great for streaming. I was able to unblock a handful of Netflix libraries, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Romania and South Africa. Disney Plus US and UK streaming worked well -- I watched Moana and Abbott Elementary. BBC iPlayer streamed The Fall buttery smooth with Privado. I had difficulty circumventing regional content blocks and could only access Amazon Prime Video US servers with Privado, but I still enjoyed streaming The Beekeeper in 4K. Many US-only streaming services worked flawlessly using a PrivadoVPN US server: I watched Buffy The Vampire Slayer on Hulu, Parks and Recreation on Peacock, Evil on Paramount Plus and My Hero Academia on Crunchyroll all buffer-free.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t get CBC to play -- by contrast, NordVPN easily unblocked the CBC Gem website, so I was able to get my Murdoch Mysteries fix. Similarly, Privado didn’t allow access to Max using a US server, which would be an issue for folks from the States traveling abroad but still wanting to binge-watch House of the Dragon or other content on Max. Ultimately I can’t complain about Privado’s geo-unblocking performance, which can be a great way to save money on streaming subscriptions.\n\nCustomer service and knowledge base: Pretty good, but may not be ideal for absolute beginners\n\nUnlike many other VPN providers, PrivadoVPN doesn’t offer live chat. Instead, you’ll need to rely on the knowledge base, installation guides, or contacting support. According to the website, the support team is available 365 days a year. I contacted support asking about whether there was an Apple TV app and got a reasonably quick reply that one was being developed with no estimated launch date.\n\nYou’ll find setup guides for several platforms, including Android/Android TV, Fire TV, iOS, MacOS and Windows. Privado also offers manual setup instructions for routers, Linux operating systems and other devices. Its knowledge base contains fundamental troubleshooting information, like diagnosing internet connectivity issues, but isn’t the most robust. For instance, Surfshark and PIA -- both in the same price range as Privado -- provide more detailed guides for troubleshooting. Surfshark, for example, has a helpful guide to diagnosing Netflix streaming issues, while Privado sticks to the basics. I’d like to see a fleshed-out help center and even some limited live chat hours, but the responsive email support should be fine for most folks.\n\nKey takeaway: Privado is great for streaming and features intuitive enough apps, but its befuddling kill-switch behavior and lack of live chat for support may deter some absolute VPN beginners.\n\nPrivacy and transparency: A reader-friendly privacy policy and privacy-focused jurisdiction, but no third-party audits\n\nJurisdiction: Switzerland.\n\nEncryption: AES-256 (OpenVPN and IKEv2) or ChaCha20 (WireGuard)\n\nNo DNS leaks detected\n\nNot audited\n\nProtocols available: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec\n\nVPNs are privacy tools -- although many folks rely on them for entertainment purposes, like streaming movies and gaming. PrivadoVPN’s privacy is a mixed bag. I appreciated its privacy-friendly jurisdiction in Switzerland, which isn’t part of the Five, Nine or 14 Eyes data-sharing alliances. There’s industry-standard AES-256-bit encryption for the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols, with ChaCha20 for Wireguard. I didn’t detect any DNS leaks in my benchmarking. If you’re concerned, you can always test whether your VPN is working.\n\nThe kill switch is confusing and switching servers without it enabled reveals your IP address\n\nPrivado, like most other VPN providers, has a kill switch, which protects your IP address from leaking in the event of an unexpected internet disruption (like your Wi-Fi going out). The kill switch works globally, so even if you disconnect from a server manually to stop your VPN from running or completely close out of Privado, your internet remains off. It’s a strange behavior and one that I’ve yet to encounter in a VPN before. I’d rather have the kill switch only operate while the VPN connection is active so that I can manually disconnect or close entirely out of the app without having to toggle the kill switch on and off each time.\n\nAdditionally -- like many VPN apps -- the encrypted tunnel breaks when you switch servers, meaning your IP address is exposed, even if briefly. Only a handful of VPN companies have encrypted tunnels that don’t break when hopping between servers, notably NordVPN. To Privado’s credit, they’ve made this as obvious as possible, with a lock symbol that’s secured while you’re on a VPN server and unlocked when you’re not. When switching servers, it unlocks and shows your public IP address.\n\nSince you have to disable your kill switch when you manually disconnect or close out of the PrivadoVPN app, you’ll need to remember to re-enable it when you get back on. Thankfully, the kill switch is on the home screen, so it’s fairly easy to remember. Nevertheless, I’d like to see Privado update their kill switch to disengage when you disconnect from a server and close out of the app altogether, which would be a more user-friendly experience.\n\nPrivadoVPN has a reader-friendly privacy policy\n\nVPN privacy policies can be Dickensian, filled with obtuse, nearly indecipherable jargon. Privado keeps its privacy policy concise and well-plotted out. I didn’t notice any red flags. The company is upfront about the information that they do -- and don’t -- collect. The privacy policy explains: “We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries associated with a PrivadoVPN connection. We are not able to connect activity originating from an IP address from our VPN servers to activity conducted by a user of PrivadoVPN. We will never sell your data to any third parties.”\n\nLike most VPN companies, Privado does need to collect some information about you, such as your name and email address -- but payment information is processed by third parties. There are some anonymous device usage statistics gathered, but you can opt-out from within the app. On the free plan, bandwidth usage is measured, but there’s no identifiable information along with that data.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with Privado’s privacy policy. It’s simple to follow and straightforward.\n\nPrivado makes no-logging claims but hasn’t been audited\n\nThird-party audits are important trust signals that VPN providers can send to their users. Almost every VPN company boasts a zero-logging policy, but you can and arguably should be skeptical. Audits back up VPN service braggadocio, verifying that your information truly isn’t being collected. Our favorite VPNs, like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark and Proton VPN, undergo annual audits.\n\nPrivado said over email, “Conducting an audit diverts development resources and requires a code freeze during the review, which is problematic given our busy pipeline… An audit is only valid at the time it’s conducted, so we haven't prioritized it over other initiatives.” Additionally, Privado expressed its opinion that audits are difficult to justify outside of marketing benefits.\n\nI hear where Privado is coming from -- audits certainly aren’t cheap and don’t paint a full picture of privacy. In all fairness, most people who want to stream Netflix, Disney Plus or other apps with a VPN may be unconcerned with strict privacy. Folks with critical privacy needs -- from torrenting enthusiasts and political activists to investigative journalists and asylum seekers -- need to know that their web traffic is actually private. Moreover, I don’t entirely agree with Privado’s statement, as audits are reliable trust signals for would-be-paying customers who probably pass up on Privado in favor of the countless VPN services that have been audited. Considering its lack of no-logging audits, it’s tough for me to recommend PrivadoVPN to anyone with moderate to crucial privacy requirements. In the future, I’d like to see Privado undergo annual audits. The exception to this is for the free plan -- it’s hard to complain about a lack of audits when you’re not paying a dime.\n\nKey takeaway: PrivadoVPN provides privacy fundamentals like modern encryption, an easy-to-read privacy policy and even has privacy-friendly jurisdiction. Its lack of third-party audits holds it back, meaning it’s only suitable for casual VPN situations like streaming or gaming rather than situations where privacy is paramount.\n\nPrivadoVPN’s free plan is an excellent choice for casual VPN users\n\nUsually, free VPNs should be sidestepped, with ProtonVPN as one of the few notable exceptions. PrivadoVPN offers a strong no-cost VPN plan that doesn’t throttle your internet speeds or sell your data and allows for streaming service unblocking so you can access foreign Netflix libraries. Despite its unreliable internet download speed performance and privacy issues, it’s hard to complain about free service. You’re limited to 10GB of data usage per 30-day cycle, and you can pick from servers in 13 different cities -- by contrast, ProtonVPN’s free package doesn’t let you choose which VPN server you use, instead shuffling you through one automatically.\n\nBecause of its slow speeds on some protocols, below-average privacy (it hasn’t been audited) and small server network, it’s tough to recommend PrivadoVPN’s paid plans. For around the same price, you can get PIA, which isn’t the fastest but boasts a much larger web of servers alongside significantly better privacy. Alternatively, Surfshark starts at nearly the same price as Privado, sporting blazing-fast internet download speeds, excellent streaming service unblocking and loads of privacy features. Still, I could see some edge cases where a Privado paid plan makes sense, such as an upgrade path from the free tier to avoid switching VPN providers and creating another account elsewhere."
