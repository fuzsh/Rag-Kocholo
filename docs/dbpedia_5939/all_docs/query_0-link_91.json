The only way I'm able to mitigate the killed connection is by forcing all torrent traffic through UDP on my Windscribe VPN, however this particular protocol negatively impacts both my download/upload speeds for torrents.\n\nDetails:\n\nI have a Ubiquiti UDM Pro as my firewall and it is hardwired to my PC over a 2.5 gig Cat 6 connection supplied by a Rogers 1.5 Gig (1.5 Gig down, 50 MB up) service. On this particular PC I run a Windscribe VPN client with port forwarding set up to ensure connectivity.\n\nWhen I have the Windscribe VPN set to the Wireguard protocol, I can get torrents downloaded at a rate of approx 100 MiB/s and 5 MiB/s up.... however, within minutes this rate steadily falls to zero, and then I lose all internet/WAN connectivity on my network. The only way to restore internet access is to reboot/powercycle my Rogers modem.\n\nI've found a workaround that seems to allow me to download/upload torrents, but at a significant speed reduction... If I switch my Windscribe VPN to UDP protocol, my download speeds top out at about 20 MiB/s and uploads are in the the range of 500 KiB/s to 1MiB/s (often lower).\n\nI have no idea why UDP seems to resolve the connectivity issue, but I would like to take advantage of the speed I know is available without killing my entire network, every time I download.\n\nIs this something Rogers is doing on their end to throttle my connection for torrents? Needless to say its really annoying having to powercycle my modem. So much so, I've invested in a smart plug device that constantly pings google.com and automatically resets the plug for my rogers modem anytime it detects lost internet connectivity.\n\nIs this a QOS issue i need to set up in my UDM Pro? Or do I need to limit the maximum download speed in my torrent client (qBittorrent)?\n\nAny ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated. Mind you, I'm not an IT expert and barely a novice most my network learning come from YT videos and DIY tutorials (so please go easy on me).\n\nTHANKS!!!\n\n21 replies\n\nmiddleofnowhere\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1731 posts\n\n2187 upvotes\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by Windscribe UDP. UDP is a transport layer protocol that can carry VPN traffic (along with a lot of other things--including Wireguard), but it's not a VPN protocol.\n\nDo you have your Rogers modem in bridge mode?\n\nIf you're not using bridge mode, then my suspicion is that the Rogers modem can't cope with 100 MB/s of UDP traffic and is overheating/crashing under the load. \"UDP\" (likely OpenVPN over UDP) is slow enough that the modem can cope with it. Putting the modem in bridge mode may fix this.\n\nYou could also try progressively lower speed caps for torrent traffic. Try using Wireguard but cap speeds at 20 MB/s. If that works, increase the speed cap until things break then back off to the last known-good limit.\n\nelgros4\n\nDeal Addict\n\n2025 posts\n\n1819 upvotes\n\nQuébec\n\nRepooc wrote: ↑ *this thread is NOT about downloading illegal torrents (torrents can also be used for legitimate purposes), but rather trying to troubleshoot a network connectivity issue*\n\nSummary:\n\nI have a complete Ubiquiti Unifi home network that seems to suffer during heavy torrent downloads and results in a required hard reboot/powercycle of my Rogers modem in order to restore internet connectivity.

When your torrents suck up all of the upload bandwidth, it doesn't leave any for other devices and uses. This can easily affect your ability to do a simple DNS request....which in effect is an upload/request and crimples that network usage. You need to do QOS on your upload and reserve at least 1-2mbps or 10% of your upload bandwidth for everything but torrents. I experienced this issue when I had rogers and that was my solution. Having moved to bell fiber where I get 1GB up and 1.5 down....the problem went away.\n\nmiddleofnowhere\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1731 posts\n\n2187 upvotes\n\nfordmaple wrote: ↑ Your issue is that your torrents are saturating your Rogers upload ability which is often very small in comparison to your download.\n\nUpload saturation would resolve just by stopping the torrent.

If your test direct is successful with no issues to the modem then maybe try setting up a new network as a test with OOB setting with nothing configured and test again and see what happens.\n\nSometimes you could be over thinking the situation and not applying the KISS methodology. I know I’ve been a victim lf my own experience over thinking and over analyzing without going back to the basics.\n\n__\n\nWant to know the latest Costco Clearance items and prices in Ontario.. check out my thread here.\n\nmiddleofnowhere\n\nDeal Addict\n\n1731 posts\n\n2187 upvotes\n\nNickL645 wrote: ↑ Torrents (if you're not limiting the number connections) will open a large number of connections potentially if there are lots of peers.\n\nThis could potentially be saturating the number of connections that the rogers modem can handle, due to the number of open connections possible.\n\nSince OP is using a VPN, all connections used by the torrent are hidden inside the VPN tunnel.

That is how I'm able to use my UDM Pro as my firewall/router for my home network.\n\n2) To those of you unfamiliar with WIndscribe VPN's GUI, they allow you to choose between several protocols; I've inserted a snip below:\n\n. .\n\nAdmittedly, \"Wireguard\" offers the best speed/performance, but \"UDP\" ensures that I don;'t crash out my connection.\n\nI saw a comment about limiting my total amount of connections to 300 as well? Perhaps I'll give that a shot. Below is snip of my current config in qBittorrent:\n\n. .\n\nAny other setting recommendation would greatly be appreciated!\n\nThanks again for all your input, everyone!\n\nI think I'll start with placing a cap on the download speed in qBittorrent first to see if I can work back to a speed that doesn't kill my connection.\n\nFormerSlacker\n\nSr. Member\n\n507 posts\n\n542 upvotes\n\nWhich modem do you have? I've noticed that my XB7 got a firmware update in the last couple of weeks which seems unstable; after about 7-8 days uptime it sometimes will just lose connectivity with heavy traffic... has issues bonding the upstream... but in my case eventually the modem will just reboot on its own after about 5 minutes.\n\nHad no such issues with the previous firmware, stats are fine haven't changed.\n\nYou also need to understand that these modems don't give you a real bridge mode so often you'll see issues like this.\n\nAre you losing sync or is the modem just refusing to pass packets? Can you login to the modem when it's not working?\n\nSickBeast\n\nDeal Expert\n\n17675 posts\n\n9238 upvotes\n\nOP you should limit your upload speed to 80% or less of your total upload bandwidth. Lower the connection count as others have said.\n\nI hope you're aware of the complete mess of a situation that many RFD'ers are in due to torrenting.

I wouldn't call them access points, though, but rather combo modems. The access point term is reserved for WiFi devices that just provide WiFi without routing functionality."
