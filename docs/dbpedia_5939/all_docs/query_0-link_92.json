        "text": "UPDATED: Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics, has filed a second complaint on Aug. 3, along with two organizers of the event, Alexandre Billard and Thierry Reboul, alleging death threats, swiftly prompting the crime unit (BRDP) to launch a new investigation, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office.\n\nAccording to national newspaper Le Parisien, some of the death threats cited verses of the Quran, saying that the “Allah’s punishment will fall down on the organizers in Saint Denis.” The closing ceremony will take place at the Stade de France, located in Saint Denis, on the outskirts of Paris. Billard is the joint managing director of the event planner agency Ubi Bene, while Reboul is the executive director of the Olympic ceremonies.\n\nJolly previously filed a complaint on July 30, the same day that the DJ of the ceremony, known as Barbara Butch, also filed a complaint for cyber harassment.\n\nWhile the opening ceremony has been widely praised for its originality and innovation — and is the first in modern history to be hosted outdoors — it has also been the subject of backlash from the Catholic Church as well as from prominent conservative figures like Rob Schneider and Candace Cameron Bure, who objected to a scene which seemed to riff on Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting “The Last Supper.”\n\nJolly told French outlet BFMTV last weekend that the segment was in fact not inspired by “The Last Supper,” and was instead a tribute to Greek mythology, but it has continued to stoke controversy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron spoke out in support of Jolly, while visiting an Olympic site at the Invalides. Macron was quoted by news outlet AFP saying “nothing justifies that an artist be threatened. The French were very proud of this ceremony. France gave the face of what it is — it showed its audacity and it did so with the freedom it needed.”\n\nIn his complaint, Jolly said he was the “target of online threats and slurs criticizing his sexual orientation and his wrongly-assumed Israeli origins,” according to the prosecutors office.\n\nButch, who took part in the scene that appeared to be inspired by “The Last Supper,” announced earlier this week on Instagram that she had been “the target of an extremely violent campaign of cyber-harassment and defamation.” Butch also told Le Parisien that she has received antisemistic slurs and swastikas, as well as homophobic, sexist, fat-phobic insults, and even heinous messages urging her to commit suicide.\n\nReacting to the controversy over the apparent parody of “The Last Supper,” Jolly told French news channel BFM TV that the scene which unleashed a torrent of hate speech was meant to raise awareness “of the absurdity of violence between human beings,” and denied he had been inspired by the Da Vinci’s religious painting.\n\nInstead, Jolly said the idea was to “have a grand pagan festival connected to the gods of Olympus.”\n\n“It was pretty clear, it is Dionysus who arrives at the table. Why is he there? Because Dionysus is the Greek god of festivities (…) and wine, and is the father of Sequana, the goddess of the Seine river,” he said."
