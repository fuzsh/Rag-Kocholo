        "text": "From Taskbar\n\nYou can change theÂ network setting of your Wi-Fi connectionÂ right from the Windows taskbar. Choosing the network, youâre planning to use when you switch network types is essential. If you use multiple networks, you might want to go through these steps more than once to ensure each is set as you prefer.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Click theÂ Wi-Fi symbolÂ on the right side of your taskbar. A list of networks should appear, including the network to which youâre currently connected.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Properties. It will appear in the faint text under the network connection status.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â ChooseÂ Public or PrivateÂ by clicking the appropriate option on the new windows.\n\nWindows displays a basic explanation of private and public network types in this area, explaining that your computer is hidden from other devices on the network if you select public. You canât use it to share printers or files.\n\nThough itâs easy to change the network connection this way, it must be a network youâre actively connected to. If you need to change it on multiple Wi-Fi networks, connect to each and repeat the steps.Â\n\nUsing Settings\n\nYou can also change the network connection type in Settings. Many people choose this option if theyâre using anÂ Ethernet cableÂ to connect to the Internet.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â PressÂ Windows key + X.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â ChooseÂ Settings.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Network and Internet.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â On the left-side pane, ChooseÂ Ethernet.\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Click on the name of your connection. You may have multiple connections listed, so choose the one youâre actively using.\n\n6.Â Â Â Â ChooseÂ Private.\n\n7.Â Â Â Â Close the window.\n\nNow you should find other computers on your network and use networked printers. You can always return to the page and change the network back to the public setting in the same way later if you prefer.\n\nFrom PowerShell\n\nIf you prefer to use commands to change the network type, you can do it in PowerShell. Itâs crucial to run PowerShell as an administrator because making these kinds of changes requires that level of access.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â PressÂ Windows key + X.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Windows PowerShell (Admin).\n\n3.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ YesÂ to confirm that the program can run as an administrator.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Type âget-netconnectionprofileâ without quotes and then press Enter. Youâll see detailed information about your current network connection, including the interface, category, and which IP protocol itâs using.\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Make a note of theÂ network nameÂ youâre trying to adjust, because you have to use the exact name in the following command.Â\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Type âset-netconnectionprofile -name ânetwork nameâ -network category privateâ without external quotes. Replace the word network name with the exact name of your network.Â\n\noÂ Â Â It should end up looking like this: âset-netconnectionprofile -name âMy Wi-Fi Networkâ -network category private.\n\n7.Â Â Â Â PressÂ Enter.Â Â\n\n8.Â Â Â Â Type âget-netconnectionprofileâ without quotes and pressÂ Enter. You can confirm that the type of network connection has changed this way.\n\nYou donât have to copy the exact capitalization of your network name. Just make sure you do include the spaces, and the name must be in quotes.\n\nUsing Local Group Policy Editor\n\nThe group policy editor is a Windows utility that lets users adjust their PC settings. With this program, you can switch the type of network from public to private.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â PressÂ Windows key + R.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Type âgpedit.mscâ without quotes and then press Enter.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Expand the following categories:\n\nComputer ConfigurationÂ >Â Windows SettingsÂ >Â Security Settings\n\n4.Â Â Â Â HighlightÂ Network List Manager Policies. A list of options will appear in the pane to the right of the categories.\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Double-click the name of your network. If you donât see it, then double-clickÂ Unidentified Networks.\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Click theÂ Network LocationÂ tab. Some types of networks may not have multiple tabs available.\n\n7.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Private.\n\n8.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Apply.\n\n9.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ OKÂ and then close the Local Policy Group Editor.\n\n10.Â Â Â RestartÂ your computer.\n\nUnless youâre the admin on a network orÂ configuring a computer for multiple users, there are more straightforward ways to change the network type. However, this can be useful to people setting up computers for specific purposes.Â\n\nMaking Registry Changes\n\nYou can also change the network type by editing the registry. However, this is probably overkill and unnecessary for most users.Â\n\nIf you have difficulty changing network types of the other way, try this as a last resort. Remember to always back up your PC before making changes to the registry since doing so can create problems for your system.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â PressÂ Windows key + R.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Type âregeditâ without quotes. PressÂ Enter.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Yes.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Expand the following categories:\n\nComputerÂ >Â HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEÂ >Â SoftwareÂ >Â MicrosoftÂ >Â Windows NTÂ >Â CurrentVersionÂ >Â Network ListÂ >Â Profiles\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Under profiles, youâll see a list of folders that display information in the right-side pane when highlighted. Each of these represents a connection your computer has made to the Internet. The numbers and letters are called aÂ globally unique identifier, and each one will be different.Â\n\n6.Â Â Â Â HighlightÂ a GUID and look at theÂ Profile NameÂ listing.Â ContinueÂ highlighting them until you find one with a network name that matches the network you want to adjust.\n\n7.Â Â Â Â Double-click theÂ CategoryÂ entry in the same pane.Â\n\n8.Â Â Â Â Change the Value Data entry to 1 to set the network to private.\n\n9.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ OK.\n\n10.Â Â Â Close the registry.\n\n11.Â Â Â Â RestartÂ your computer.\n\nOne of the benefits of changing the network type through the registry is that you can quickly change the network type for multiple networks.Â\n\nIf you need to use the Domain setting instead of public or private, you can do that through the registry as well. The Value Data should beÂ set to 0 for publicÂ andÂ 1 for private.\n\nChanging Network Settings\n\nYour network settings arenât set in stone. You can change what each network type actually means in your Windows settings.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â PressÂ Windows key + X.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â ChooseÂ Settings.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Network and Internet.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Network and Sharing Center.\n\n5.Â Â Â Â ClickÂ Change Advanced Sharing Settings.\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Expand the network type you want to change. You can choose between three.\n\noÂ Â Â Private\n\noÂ Â Â Guest or Public\n\noÂ Â Â All Networks\n\n7.Â Â Â Â Decide what you want to share and how you want to share it.\n\n8.Â Â Â Â CloseÂ the window.\n\nYou can opt-in or out of network discovery or printer sharing on both private and public options.\n\nIn the All-Networks option, you can adjust what kind of encryption you use and choose whether sharing should beÂ password protected.\n\nStick with 128-bit encryption as long as your system supports it. There shouldnât be much need to change this particular setting.\n\nThere are only specific circumstances where this will be necessary, and most users are unlikely to encounter them unless they already have the specialized knowledge to know they need to switch.Â\n\nYou can choose to use password-protected sharing or not, as you prefer. Remember that using a password is always more secure than not doing so.\n\nIf you require a password, remember that youâll have to share it with other people on your network if you want to connect with other usersâ computers and not just network your own devices.Â\n\nÂ"
