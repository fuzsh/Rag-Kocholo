I know there's not much of a difference between it & the Torrent, other than space & fans.\n\nBut there's a dual cable that I need to know what it's for so that I can continue my build.\n\nThere's 2 sets of plugs on one wire. One comes with a protective cap on it that is a small 3 prong while the secondary is a 3 prong female. Are these to daisy chain compatible fans with the front 2? If they are, I can tuck those out of the way.\n\nI wasn't able to get the same brand of fans as the front. (Prism)\n\nThis case has 14 connectors and none are labelled in any way other than the HD Audio & the front headers."
