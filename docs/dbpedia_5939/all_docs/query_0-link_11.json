        "text": "THE BRIEF\n\nTCL Cables is a subsidiary of Torrent Power, one of the leading brands in the Indian power sector. They noticed that visitors were not paying attention during the safety induction and hired us to make a 3D animation safety video. They also wanted to integrate the safety instructions for visitors and contractors in one video.\n\nOUR STRATEGY\n\nPeople were getting distracted because of the outdated low-quality graphics. We wanted to remedy this drawback in the new video by creating life-like 3D animation in a custom-made 3D environment of TCL Cable’s plant.\n\nTo get started with the project first, we needed to photograph the plant premises and a couple of staff members. It was important to capture details of the uniforms, the codes of the helmet, the PPEs and the signages since we would use this as references for the environment and characters. While the 3D team worked on building the models, the writers researched and drafted a script for the video. For this project, the main challenge was to get the script right. It was a challenge to blend instructions for visitors and contractors together, but we accomplished it, nonetheless. Once that department was sorted, we could easily do our magic with the graphics and animation.\n\nTHE RESULT\n\nWe created a safety animation video that was an upgrade for the company in every sense of the word. Now, TCL Cables didn’t need to worry about viewers getting distracted and not being aware of the safety guidelines. Plus, creating a video version in Hindi for contractors and for visitors in English too helped aptly communicate with the target audience."
