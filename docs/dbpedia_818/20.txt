David Thwaites, who has worked in property management and agency at FI Real Estate Management, Lambert Smith Hampton and Avison Young, has set up his own consultancy, Thwaites Real Estate.

Altrincham-based TRE will offer property management services, specialising in maximising value for both landlord and tenant clients across the various sectors of commercial property.

During his 20-year career, Thwaites worked at consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton for 13 years, latterly as head of office agency, and as associate head of office agency at Avison Young for three years until 2016.

He then moved client-side, working for FI Real Estate Management as senior asset manager in Chorley.

For the past four years, he has been responsible for asset managing several nationwide portfolios totalling around 2.4m sq ft, let to a mixture of blue-chip and regional occupiers.

Thwaites said: “With the unprecedented changes and disruption brought to the industry by Covid-19 and the need for greater engagement and collaboration between landlord and tenants, there has never been a greater need for both parties to be able to call upon trusted and informed strategic advice.”

His new consultancy is “all about maximising value with a proactive forensic approach that delivers results for our clients in a thoughtful engaging manner” Thwaites added – “to ensure that we become their trusted advisor of choice when dealing with any matters relating to commercial property.”

TRE will work across all areas of commercial property in the North West and beyond.
