        "text": "Dove Olivia Cameron was born Chloe Celeste Hosterman on January 15, 1996 in Bainbridge Island, Washington to Bonnie J. Wallace, an acting coach & Philip Alan Hosterman, a chief executive officer/founder of Kandahar Trading Company. She's known for playing a dual role as the eponymous characters in the Disney Channel teen sitcom, Liv und Maddie (2013) and playing Mal, daughter of Maleficent in Descendants (2015) and the sequel Descendants 2 (2017). Subsequently, she had a recurring role as Ruby in the ABC television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2018). She is set to voice Spider-Woman in Marvel's upcoming animated superhero feature film Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors (2018).\n\nWhen she was a child, she attended Sakai Intermediate School. At the age of 8, she began acting in community theater at Bainbridge Performing Arts.\n\nWhen she was 14, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, where she sang in Burbank High School's National Championship Show Choir. Cameron is of French descent, and is a fluent speaker of French, having spent many years of her life growing up in France. She has stated she was bullied through her entire school experience, starting in fifth grade, through the end of high school. Regardless of the pressure at school and fitting in, she stayed focused on her dreams of becoming successful in entertainment: \"I became very passionate about [becoming an actress and singer]. I fully immersed myself\". Her father died in 2011 when she was 15 years old.\n\nIn 2007, Cameron played the role of a young Cosette in the Bainbridge Performings Arts stage production of Les Miserables, and in 2008, she had the lead role of Mary in The Secret Garden, again with BPA.\n\nIn 2012, Cameron was cast in a new Disney Channel Original Series entitled Bits and Pieces as Alanna. Shortly after filming the pilot, Bits and Pieces was retooled into Liv and Maddie and saw Cameron starring in the dual lead role of Liv and Maddie Rooney. The preview of the series debuted on July 19, 2013, and the show premiered on September 15, 2013. The pilot episode gained 5.8 million viewers, which was the most-watched in total viewers in 2.5 years since the series Shake It Up! Disney Channel renewed Liv and Maddie for a 13-episode second season slated to premiere in Fall 2014, which was later expanded to 24 episodes.\n\nOn August 27, 2013, Cameron released a cover of \"On Top of the World\" by Imagine Dragons as a promotional single. Her cover peaked on the Billboard Kid Digital Songs chart at seventeen and spent three weeks on the chart. On October 15, 2013, \"Better In Stereo\" was released as a single under Walt Disney Records. \"Better In Stereo\" made its debut on the Billboard Kid Digital Songs chart at No. 21 before peaking at No. 1, becoming Cameron's first No. 1 hit. In February 2014, Cameron confirmed reports that recording had begun for her debut studio album. Her next single, \"Count Me In\", was released on June 3, 2014. The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Kids Digital Songs chart. Cameron played Liz Larson in her first non-Disney film, Barely Lethal, which was theatrically released by A24 Films in 2015.\n\nCameron starred in the television film Descendants which premiered on July 31, 2015. The film was viewed by 6.6 million people and spawned Cameron's two first Billboard Hot 100 songs, \"Rotten to the Core\" at No. 38 and a solo song, \"If Only\", at No. 94. Other songs from the film featuring Cameron such as \"Set It Off\" and \"Evil Like Me\" charted at No. 6 and 12 respectively on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The soundtrack for the movie peaked atop the Billboard 200 chart becoming the first soundtrack from a Disney Channel Original Movie since High School Musical 2 to do so. As part of the Descendants franchise, Cameron released a cover of Christina Aguilera's hit song, \"Genie in a Bottle\". The music video premiered on Disney Channel on March 18, 2016. The single received 22 million views in less than a month.\n\nOn December 22, 2015, Liv and Maddie was officially renewed for a fourth season, becoming the 9th live-action Disney Channel show in history to achieve this. Cameron began filming the season of Liv and Maddie in early 2016. It was later announced that this would be the final season of the show. The series finale of Liv and Maddie later aired on March 24, 2017.\n\nCameron played the role of Amber Von Tussle in the NBC live television presentation of Hairspray Live!, which aired on December 7, 2016. Reception was generally positive, and Cameron's performance was praised.\n\nCameron reprized her role as Mal in Descendants 2, the sequel to Descendants, in 2017. The film premiered on July 21, 2017. The Descendants 2 soundtrack debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200, with \"It's Goin' Down\" from the soundtrack debuting at #81. This became Cameron's third Hot 100 entry, following \"Rotten to the Core\" and \"If Only\".\n\nCameron played the role of Sophie in the Hollywood Bowl live production of Mamma Mia!. The show took place from July 28, 2017 to July 30, 2017. On August 21, 2017, Cameron was cast in the film Dumplin, starring Jennifer Aniston. Cameron is set to play Bekah Cotter in the comedy. In late 2017 Cameron signed on to appear in a recurring role in Season 5 of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. This role was later revealed to be Ruby, the daughter of General Hale (Catherine Dent).\n\nWith her expressive blue eyes, soft, Southern-tinged voice and an acting range that can carry her from hysterically funny to terrifying in seconds, Patricia Arquette is one of the most underrated and talented actresses of her generation. Though she has been working for years, she's always stayed just under the radar of true stardom, despite a 1995 marriage to Nicolas Cage.\n\nPatricia was born in Chicago, though the family soon moved to a commune near Arlington, Virginia. Her parents, Lewis Arquette, an actor, and Brenda Denaut (née Nowak), an acting teacher and therapist, had 4 other children: Rosanna Arquette, Richmond Arquette, Alexis Arquette, and David Arquette, all actors. Her paternal grandfather, Cliff Arquette, was also an entertainer. Patricia's mother was from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Poland and Russia), while Patricia's father had French-Canadian, Swiss-German, and English ancestry.\n\nAt 15, Patricia ran away from home to live with her sister Rosanna and, after initial insecurity, got her start in Die Bikinifalle (1987). A year later, she gained attention for her starring role in Nightmare 3 - Freddy lebt (1987), considered by many to be the best film of the Nightmare series. In 1989, Patricia's son, Enzo (father is Paul Rossi), was born. Soon after, her career took off, and she has since appeared in such critically acclaimed movies as True Romance (1993), Rangoon (1995), Ethan Frome (1992), Lost Highway (1997) and Flirting with Disaster - Ein Unheil kommt selten allein (1996). She won a CableACE award in 1991 for her portrayal of a deaf epileptic in Wilde Alice (1991). In 1997, after her mother died of breast cancer, Patricia took the lead in the fight against the disease. She has run in the annual Race for the Cure and in 1999 was the Lee National Denim Day spokesperson.\n\nCardi B was born Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar on October 11, 1992 in Manhattan, New York City, New York & raised in The Bronx, New York City, New York. She became an Internet celebrity after several of her posts and videos became popular on Vine and Instagram. From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series, Love & Hip Hop (2010), which depicted her pursuit of her music aspirations. She released two mixtapes: Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1 & Vol. 2, before signing with label Atlantic Records on early 2017. Her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, broke several streaming records, was certified triple platinum by the RIAA and named by Billboard the top female rap album of the 2010s. Critically acclaimed, it won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, making Cardi the only woman to win the award as a solo artist, as well as the first female rap artist in 15 years to be nominated for Album of the Year. It spawned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100; Bodak Yellow, which made her the second female rapper to top the chart with a solo output-following Lauryn Hill on 1998-and I Like It, which made her the first female rapper to attain multiple number-one songs on the chart. Her Maroon 5 collaboration, Girls Like You made her the only female rapper to top the Hot 100 three times. WAP, the lead single of her second album, expanded her record as the female rapper with the most Hot 100 number-one singles as her fourth leader, and made her the only female rap artist to achieve chart-topping singles in 2 decades (2010s and 2020s).\n\nRecognized by Forbes as one of the most influential female rappers of all time, Cardi's known for her aggressive flow and candid lyrics, which have received widespread media coverage. She's the highest-certified female rapper of all time on the RIAA's Top Artists (Digital Singles) ranking, also appearing among the ten highest-certified female artists and having the top certified song by a female rap artist. She's the only female rapper with multiple billion-streamers on Spotify. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, 8 Billboard Music Awards, 5 Guinness World Records, 4 American Music Awards, 11 BET Hip Hop Awards & 2 ASCAP Songwriter of the Year awards. In 2018, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nAnita was born January 26, 1958 in Toledo, Ohio and grew up in Detroit, Michigan. She began singing in church choir when she was 12 and at 16 sang in a local group along with high school friends. In 1975 she successfully auditioned for the group Chapter 8, having been approached by bass player David Washington, and spent the next few years playing in and around Detroit, eventually signing with Ariola, releasing an album in 1979. However, when Ariola was bought out by Arista, the group's contract was not renewed.\n\nAnita returned to Detroit, finally working with a law firm as a receptionist. In 1981, Otis Smith, who was the man behind Chapter 8's contract, formed his own label, Beverly Glenn. He contacted her in 1982 and offered her a deal which at first she refused, but when Smith increased the amount of his original offer, and the contract was approved legally, she accepted, releasing the album \"Songstress\" in 1983. In 1986 she signed with Elektra, and at the same time was an executive producer on \"Rapture\", her debut album for the label, which sold over 6 million records worldwide. She won two Grammy awards: Best R&B Female Performance for the album \"Rapture\" and Best R&B Song for \"Sweet Love\".\n\nIn 1987, Anita began work on her follow-up album \"Giving You The Best That I Got\" in between a busy performance schedule. This album was also awarded three Grammies: one in1989 for Best R&B Female Performance, one in 1990 for Best R&B Song (\"Giving You The Best That I Got\") and one for Best R&B Song (\"Just Because\"). She took a more involved role in the song-writing for her third album, Compositions, also moving towards experimenting with jazz. The album contained 7 self-penned songs and was mostly cut live.; the album won her a 7th Grammy award for Best R&B Female Performance.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1988, she married Walter Bridgforth, Jr, whom she had met two years earlier in her home of Detroit and in January 1993, gave birth to a son, Walter Baker Bridgforth. Five months later Anita started working on her next project, \"Rhythm of Love\" and produced most of the album, which was mainly recorded in her home due to another pregnancy, writing 5 out of the 12 songs. In September 1994 (after the birth of her second son, Edward Carlton Bridgforth earlier that year) the album was released and attracted an 8th Grammy for Best R&B Song (\"I Apologize\") in 1995.\n\nSadly, her parents died within two years of each other; her mother in 1996 and her father 2 years later, and during this time, attempted to record and release a new CD. Unfortunately, the tracks recorded for the new CD were damaged in the recording process and could not be salvaged. Anita sued and won the case against Elektra, later signing with Atlantic Records.\n\nDuring her career, she has appeared with other artists such as The Winans, Howard Hewitt, and James Ingram, and since December 2002 has began to tour again on a limited basis.\n\n\"Fairuza!\" (\"Turquoise\" in Farsi), her father exclaimed as he saw her blue eyes: Fairuza Alejandra Balk had just been born on May 21, 1974 in Point Reyes, California. Her father, Solomon Ben Feldthouse, was a traveling musician originally from Idaho, and her mother, Cathryn Balk, was a belly dancer. Her parents split up soon after. Fairuza grew up just north of San Francisco, California on a commune-type ranch. Her mother later found work in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was there that Fairuza began her career at age 9 on the ABC special The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (1983). Two years later, she went to the United Kingdom where she attended the Royal Academy of Ballet, the Ramona Beauchamp Agency, and the Bush Davies Performing Arts School. Fairuza worked for the Walt Disney Company for a while; at 11, she was chosen from 1,200 girls to star as Dorothy in Oz - eine fantastische Welt (1985). The next year she starred, prophetically enough, as The Worst Witch (1986) a harbinger of her breakout role in Der Hexenclub (1996) 10 years later.\n\nFairuza and her mother remained in London until 1988, then went to Paris where the 15-year-old starred in Valmont (1989). The next year they returned to Vancouver and Fairuza enrolled in high school, but ended up doing correspondence courses after proving shy in class. Back in Hollywood she starred in a string of movies, including Verlorene Herzen (1992), for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress. Following further television and film work, she achieved cult status with her starring role as a teenage witch in her breakout film, Der Hexenclub (1996). That year she also appeared in D.N.A. - Experiment des Wahnsinns (1996), in which she did some belly-dancing and attracted the attention of Lancashire, England-born co-star David Thewlis. They did another movie together, American Perfect (1997).\n\nFairuza was also the love interest in the wildly-popular Waterboy - Der Typ mit dem Wasserschaden (1998) and had a major role in American History X (1998). With a half-dozen movies for 2000, Fairuza is much in demand. Her interests are writing poetry and stories, playing the guitar, singing (her main enjoyment), and dancing. She lives in Venice, California and has an apartment in New York City."
