        "text": "Back, L. J. R.\n\nLeslie Joseph Ronald Back, 121432, born in 1916, was the \"dearly loved youngest son\" of William James and Ethel Back, from 113 Priory Hill, Dover, youngest brother to Harold, Cecil, and Ivy, and brother-in-law to Edith. In 1911 the family had been living at 38 Tower Hamlets Road.\n\nLeslie was a member of the Dover Cycling Club, and had worked at Messrs T. Francis as a signwriter and engraver\n\nHe served as a Pilot Officer (Wireless Operator/Air Gunner) in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and a member of 223 Squadron. He received his commission in January 1942\n\nOn 23 May 1942 he was on a raid to Derna, Libya. He took off from Landing Ground LG167 (Bir el Baheira No.2) near Bardia, Libya at 10.32 in Martin Baltimore AG708, to attack an enemy main landing ground at Derna near the northernmost coastline of Libya. At around midday near Ras el Tin the formation was attacked by Luftwaffe Messerschmitts. Three Baltimores were shot down including AG708, which was possibly the victim of the famed 'Star of Africa' Oberleutnant Hans-Joachim Marseille from Jagdgeschwader 27, the top German air 'ace' of the North Africa conflict. (He himself died on 30th September 1942, bailing out over Sidi from his smoke-filled plane)\n\nNone of the crew of AG708 survived, but Pilot Officer Back is buried in Tobruk War Cemetery, Libya, 1 B 11. On his gravestone are the words, \"In loving memory of our dear son. Earth's \"Last Post\" is Heaven's \"Reveille\"\". the other members of the crew are commemorated on Special Memorial C at Tobruk\n\nThe crew were:\n\nFlying Officer Leonard William Bangley Captain (Pilot) aged 24 Flight Sergeant Reginald Earnest Richard Cotton Observer aged 22 Pilot Officer Leslie Joseph Ronald Back Wireless operator/Air gunner aged 26 Pilot Officer David Laird Muir Air gunner aged 27\n\n\"He has made the supreme sacrifice. In death a hero\"\n\nMemorial (announcements)\n\nMrs Ethel Back was the sister of George Frederick Robus. She died on 19 March 1951, her address then being 113 Priory Hill, Dover.\n\nRAF and incident information with thanks to Dean Sumner\n\nBeal. J.\n\nJohn Beal, listed as Henry John Thomas Beal, 14398586, on the CWGC. He was the \"beloved elder son\" of Henry George Beal and his wife Louisa Olive Beal, who had married on 28 August 1922 at Holy Trinity. In 1939 the family were living at 96 Markland Road, and at home were Mr Beal, born 16 November 1898, a railway dock porter, and Mrs Beal, born 11 March 1899. They had four children; John, born 1923, Olive M J, born 1925, Reginald M G, born 1928, and Marion G L born 1930. Also there were Elizabeth Wright, Mrs Beal's mother, and Grace Wright, Mrs Beal's aunt. Mr and Mrs Beal would be at 8 Winchester Street, Whitchurch, Hampshire in 1944.\n\nJohn Beal was killed whilst serving in the 8th battaliion, Durham Light Infantry, in Normandy, France. He and his battalion landed at midday on 6 June 1944, acting as reserve battalion of 151 (Durham) Brigade, which was the divisional reserve. The landing was made on Gold Beach at La Rivière and within an hour the battalion had passed through Ver Sur Mer and were re-organising in the assembly area some two miles inland. The battalion had a fairly uneventful landing with only a few wounded as they moved inland and that would be the case up until 8 June. However, things changed drastically for the battalion after it assaulted and captured the village of Saint Pierre on 9 June (to the west of Tilly Sur Seulles). Unfortunately for the Durham Light Infantry they had run into a well-equipped and highly motivated enemy formation (one of the best in Normandy - the Panzer Lehr). It seems certain that John Beal and many of his comrades died repelling a fierce counterattack from Panzer Grenadier units of the Panzer Lehr Division on 10 and 11 June; at one stage the battalion was being fired on from three directions and one company position was overrun. However, the situation was stabilised and the village held.\n\nJohn was 21 when he died in Normandy on 11 June 1944. He is buried at Tilly Sur Seulles War Cemetery, France. II E 9. At the foot of his headstone are the words, \"In proud loving memory of our very dear son. We oft recall memories of love & tenderness\".\n\n1949 - \"In proud and ever loving memory of our dear son and brother\", from Mum, Dad, Joan, Reg and Marion, Grandma and Grandpa.\n\ndetails of action by courtesy Chris Tomlinson\n\nBenbow, C. A.\n\nCecil Anthony (\"Tony\") Benbow was born on 14 October 1922, and was 18 when he lost his life in the sinking of SS Tahoma Star on 1 February 1942. He was a cadet in the Merchant Navy and is commemorated on the Tower Hill memorial, panel 105.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1933, he was a pupil in the junior school of Dover College. He was the son of John Norman Benbow OBE and his wife, Joan H, née Stokes, who were married in Plymouth in 1914. His siblings were John, born 1915, Shelagh, born 1930, and probably Biddy. The family lived at 11 Laureston Place, Dover, from where Shelagh enjoyed breeding and showing dogs.\n\nCommander Benbow was Master in Charge of the Junior School at the College between 1924 and 1933, and at prize day 1933 he received grateful thanks and high praise for his work. He was himself an old boy of the College. Born on 2 August 1883 and christened at Meerut, Bengal, India, on 13 November 1883, he was the son of Lieut-Colonel John Edward and Mabel Christina Benbow and brother to Charles Tytler Benbow. In 1891 he was at Rathaspeck House, Park Road, Uxbridge, Hillingdon, with his grandparents John, a mealman born in Maidenhead, and Adela, born in London. Also there was their son, Arthur, a civil engineer.\n\nJohn Benbow came to Dover College as a pupil in 1895 and entered the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1898. There he played in the first teams for rugby, cricket, and hockey. He is recorded as a midshipman in 1901. He went on to the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, in 1903, again playing for the first teams in cricket and rubgy. Following was a spell at the Royal United Services Institution, where he played cricket and rugby, again in the first teams. He also played county cricket, for Devon. In 1911 he was a Lieutenant for HMS Albemarle at Portland, Dorset. He saw action at the Battle of Jutland, and commanded destroyers HMS Thorn and HMS Laverock in the North Sea fleet, including when HMS Laverock was in collision with HMS Medusa on 25 March 1916 while under attack from enemy aircraft. Commander Benbow commanded also 3rd and 7th minesweeping flotillas in 1919, retiring in 1920. During WWII he was in command of a naval depot in North Shields. He died on 18 November 1961 aged 78, at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Dover. His effects were given to Kathleen Mary Jones. His wife died five years later, aged 71.\n\nOn 31 January 1947, this notice was placed in the Dover Express. \"In proud and ever loving memory of Cadet Cecil Anthony (Tony) Benbow, presumed to have lost his life by enemy action when s.s. Tacoma Star was torpedoed off the American coast on Ist Feb., 1942: also to the memory of all his shipmates who lost their lives on on that occasion - Daddy, Mummy, John, Biddy, Shelagh.\"\n\nwith thanks for Dover College information to Philip Barry, Bursar\n\nBingham, L. C.\n\nLeslie Charles Bingham was born in Dover in 1913. His parents were probably Arthur William Bingham and Esmeralda Frances, née Pilcher, who married in Dover in 1907i. Mr Bingham in 1911 was a marine porter for the SECR, and the family were living at 35 Albany Place, Dover. Then present were elder brother Arthur Francis, 3, and elder sister Winifred Ellen, 1. There may have been a further brother, Wilfred, born in 1911. Mrs Bingham probably died in May 1932.\n\nLeslie Bingham was a former Merchant Navy Chief Engineer, and he stayed with his relatives in Dover while on leave. He had served on the oil tanker Cordelia, which was torpedoed in 1943. He and some 20 of the crew got onto a raft. When the attacking u-boat surfaced they discovered that the captain was missing, but they took Bingham on board and he became a POW in Germany (Poland?). There had been no further news of the other men on the raft.\n\nAt the end of the war Mr Bingham was released, half-starved and very nervous. He found it impossible to settle and his landlord, John Francis Bernard, said that he spent much of the time in his room with the door locked. He was found dead on 30 July 1946, the result of an eight-inch dagger wound in his chest. The death announcement in the local paper gave Mr Bingham's address as 25 Prioress Walk, Dover. The coroner gave a verdict of suicide while the balance of Mr Bingham's mind was disturbed, and added, \"These were the men that protected us, and it is tragic that the only man saved from a whole ship has carried such mental wounds that he could not settle down to civilian life again in comfort.\"\n\nHe was buried at Charlton, from Melita, Valley Road, River, the home of his brother Arthur, his body having lain overnight in Charlton Church. Mourners included his brothers and sisters-in-law, his sister Winifred and her husband Sydney Kelly, and aunts Mrs Pilcher, Mrs Dunsford, and Mrs Marsh, and friends Mr Cozen and Mrs Claw. Amongst the floral tributes was one from Lloyd's colleagues in Birmingham.\n\nwith thanks to Joyce Banks\n\nBliss, H.\n\nHarry Bliss, 650927, was the son of Mr and Mrs H Bliss, from Dover, and may have been brother to Raymond.. He was in 218 (\"Gold Coast\") Squadron of the RAF. On 28 April 1943 at 21.05 he took off from Downham Market, Norfolk, in Short Stirling EF356 HA- O. They were on mine-laying operations in the 'Sweet Peas' area ( Rostock, Germany). It was a large operation, carried out by 207 aircraft. Low cloud over the German and Danish coasts forced the minelayers to fly low to establish their positions. Around Helogiland, the approaches to the River Elbe, and other sea areas, 593 mines were laid . This was the highest number of mines laid in one night, but the mission was also the most costly mine-laying mission of the war, as 22 RAF bombers were lost\n\nOne was Stirling EF356, which, at around 00:35 hours on 29 April, was shot down by a Luftwaffe night-fighter. It crashed at Oddum, to the north of Esbjerg in Denmark. All of the crew were killed except Sergeant Bliss, who survived to become PoW 1119. He went to Camp 357. otherwise known as Stalag 'Kopernikus' at Thorn (Torun) in Poland, about 80 miles northwest of Warsaw\n\nIn late 1944 Russian forces advanced into Poland, and Camp 357 was relocated near to the existing Stalag XIB camp at Fallingbostal, about 50 miles north of Hanover. Conditions in the camp were bad; reprisals had removed from all British prisoners much of their furniture, their palliasses, and many of their blankets, and recreation was forbidden. Many prisoners suffered from bronchitis and chilblains\n\nIt was in that camp that Harry Bliss died on 30 March 1945, just six weeks before the enemy surrender on 7 May. It was fewer than four weeks before repatriation of prisoners had begun. He was 25\n\nHarry Bliss is buried at Becklingen War Cemetery southeast of Soltau, Germany. 16 D 11\n\nThe crew were:\n\nSergeant Kenneth Sidney HAILEY Captain (Pilot) aged 21 Sergeant Andrew George SURTEES Flight engineer aged 21 Sergeant Arthur George Percival SINDREY Navigator aged 21 Flying Officer Sidney Michael HOLLIMAN Bomb aimer aged 21 Sergeant Ronald James BARTON Wireless operator/Air gunner aged 22 Sergeant Harry BLISS Air gunner PoW Sergeant James Alfred HEAD Air gunner aged 20\n\nwith thanks to Dean Sumner\n\nThere is a report from the Dover Express, dated 18 May 1945, entitled \"Dover Prisoner of War Death\"\n\n\"[the conditions are] shown to be responsible for the death at a prisoner of war camp of W.O. Harry Bliss, RAF. Son of Mr and Mrs R. Bliss, 46, Maison Dieu Road, Dover, which reported in the Express of May 4\n\nIn a letter to his parents, a comrade E. Hunnable describes how W.O. Bliss was made to travel for 36 hours in a cattle truck so tightly packed that he, an ill man, could not lie down, and was kept without water\n\nAt the destination he was taken to hospital and operated upon, but never recovered. The origin of his illness was when changing camps they had to move two miles, and the German guards made them run all the way carrying full kit. The Germans prodded the men with bayonets to make them hurry, and set dogs on them with the same objective. W.O. Bliss received three bayonet wounds in the thigh. He had to be admitted to hospital, and was never the same[...]\"\n\nThe transcription is with thanks to Joyce Banks\n\nEdits by Maggie S-K\n\nBocutt, A. A.\n\nAlfred Arthur (\"Artie\") Bocutt, PO/21632, joined the Royal Marines on 7 June 1920 and had served on the battle cruiser HMS Hood for four years; he was one of the 1,415 who went down with Hood in the Denmark Strait on 24 May 1941. The Hood and the battleship HMS Prince of Wales were attempting to intercept the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, which were en route to the Atlantic to attack Allied convoys. HMS Hood was struck by several German shells, her magazines exploded and she sank.\n\nMarine Bocutt is commemorated on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial. Panel 58, Column 3\n\nBorn in 1903, he was the son of Alfred Arthur and the late Jessie Bocutt (of 30 Longfield Road), and the husband of Dorothy Ada Emily Bocutt, née McMillan, born 19 August 1904, of Southsea, Hampshire, who had married in 1934. In 1939 Mrs Bocutt was at Underhill, Hambridge, Langport, Somerset; she was living in Taunton when her husband died and later at Southsea in Hampshire. They had a daughter, Heather J M, born in 1937 in the Portsmouth area.\n\nThe grave right is in St Mary's. The headstone reads, \"In loving memory of a dear wife and mother Jessie Bocutt who fell asleep 6th January 1941 aged 64 years. Also her eldest son on Empire Day 24th May 1941 PO 21632 Marine Alfred Arthur Bocutt aged 38 years lost when HMS Hood was sunk off Greenland. Peace perfect peace. Also Alfred Arthur husband of the above died 28th April 1958 aged 83 years\".\n\nHis brother, Alexander Herbert Bocutt also died, as a civilian away from home\n\ndetails of action by Chris Tomlinson\n\n*\n\nRegarding Taunton and evacuation, a letter in the Dover Express in 1941 from a \"Dover Reader in Somerset\" read, \"I am a Dover resident, now evacuated to Taunton, Somerset, with my two children. Whilst I am here with the kiddies in comparative safety, my husband is living on his own in our house at Dover. Realising this must be very miserable for him after being out all day to come home to an empty house I was sorely tempted to come home but as I have one daughter of school age I think it would be very unfair to bring my children back to Dover, and, besides exposing them to the danger of bombs or shells, make the girl lose her schooling. I know I have been called different names for leaving my husband on his own and, in fact, I feel selfish at times, but he realises the same as I do, the children have to be studied. The general feeling amongst the mothers who have been evacuated once, but have since returned, is \"If one goes, we might just as well all go together\", which to my idea is more selfish than staying away with the children. It is not all honey being evacuated, especially when one gets billeted with difficult people, and with the extra expense, etc, but I consider by my being evacuated with my children I am doing my bit, as I would give anything to return to Dover, my home town. There is one thing, though, I do think would help - that is if there were some sort of club for the men who are on their own where they could go to for company. I know that this would mean expense, which, under the present circumstances, would have to be considered, but do you not think that this would be well worth it, if it were the means of keeping the wives and children evacuated to the safe area? I am not just speaking for myself, as I feel sure if there were only something got up for the men who have had to stay behind to carry on, the wives would be able to settle down a bit more. I miss Dover very much and will be glad when the war is over, so that I can return.\n\nBradbury, H. T.\n\nHorace Thomas Bradbury, born in 1915 in the West Bromwich area, was the son of Thomas Augustus Bradbury and his wife Annie Elizabeth, née Smith. The couple had married in 1897. In 1911 they were living at 44 Foley Street, Wednesbury, Staffordshire, with Mr Bradbury working as a bricklayer. They had then two children, George, born 1899, and Annie May, born 1907. A third child had died young.\n\nIn 1941 in Staffordshire Horace married Elsie Smith. He became 2665175, a Guardsman in the Coldstream Guards, 1st battalion. He was killed in action on 1 April 1945 when he was 29; he was reburied after concentrationede at Enschede Eastern General Cemetery, The Netherlands, grave 199A. The words at the foot of his headstone read, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith\".\n\n1949\n\n*\n\nOn 3 Jan 1936 a Horace Thomas Bradbury and four others from Adisham were charged with disorderly conduct at Wingham quarter sessions. They had tied the inner and outer doors of the church, thus preventing the choir from exiting after their practice. They had also placed a 15 foot scaffolding or flag pole against a door of the school; Rev Jackman was conducting the women's Bible class, and on hearing a knock on the door opened it. The pole fell although it did not strike him. The lads also accidentally broke a small pane of glass in the church. Rev Jackman saw these things as a joke but which had gone too far and could have had serious consequences. The magistrates agreed to treat all five leniently as a warning; they had to pay four shillings each as the costs of prosecution and were bound over for two years. On 1 December 1932 this Horace had also been fined half a crown for letting off fireworks in the street.\n\ngravestone by Wendy Lensink\n\nBradish, B.\n\nBarrington (\"Barry\") Bradish was a Greaser, Merchant Navy serving aboard the SS Maid of Kent (below), then a hospital ship. He was 57 when he died on 21 May 1940, and is commemorated at Tower Hill, London. Panel 66.\n\nHe was the son of Stephen, a fireman on the mail boats, and Caroline Bradish. In 1891 the family were at Castle Place, St James, Eastry, and at home were Mary, 19, a housemaid, born in Eastbourne, Henry, 17, a potman, born in Shoeburyness, Priscilla, 13, and John, 11, both born in Gibraltar, Barrington, 9, and Caroline, 7, both born in Ireland, and Stephen, 3, born in Dover. John died at the age of 13 in 1893.\n\nBy 1901 the family were at 1 Bowling Green Hill, and had been joined by Sarah Rose, born on 6 June 1891. Sarah, known as Rose, became in 1916 the wife of James Clift. Barrington in 1901 and 1911 was away, working as a stoker. Mrs Caroline Bradish, meanwhile had been widowed in 1902, and, still at Bowling Green Hill, was living with her son Henry, with Rose, and with Priscilla's daughter Florence, or Florrie, Spink. Priscilla had married in 1899 and was widowed shortly afterwards. Mrs Caroline Bradish died in 1915 at the age of 69.\n\nOn 23 July 1914 at Christchurch, Hougham, and living at 140 Clarendon Place, Barrington married Matilda Crepin, daughter of George Town Crepin, from 113 Clarendon Street. Matilda's brother George Henry was the father of Frederick George Thomas Crepin. Mr Bradish, with his wife and eldest daughter Winifred are above, left. The couple had six children; Winifred M, born in 1915, Barrington, 1916, George W, 1919, Mary E, 1922, Henry E, 1925, and Gladys A, 10 July 1927. Sadly little Henry died on 18 March 1926 at 113 Clarendon Street at the age of one year and two months.\n\nIn 1939 Mrs Bradish, born 19 July 1891, and with Gladys, was at 121 Clarendon Street, close to her parents at 113 and probably her brother William at 125. On 27 May 1940 Mrs Bradish was sent a letter from the Divisional Marine Manager, Mr H C Wood, of the Marine Department of the Southern Railway, stating:\n\n\"It is with great regret that I have to inform you that owing to the very inhuman bombing by enemy aircraft on the SS \"Maid of Kent\" whilst this vessel was lying in Dieppe Harbour on the 21st May, it is presumed that your husband has lost his life. His name is amongst those reported missing, and it is feared there is very little hope that he has survived.\n\n\"It is difficult on such occasions adequately to express sympathy, but in your sorrow you have the satisfaction of knowing that your dear lost one has given his life in the Country's service, and it will be for those who are left to carry on to see that he did not die in vain.\n\n\"In the loss which you have sustained, I would also say that the Company has lost a very loyal and devoted servant.\"\n\nMay 1941 In ever loving memory of a dear husband and father, Barrington (Barry) Bradish, who was lost in the sinking of the hospital ship \"Maid of Kent\" in Dieppe Harbour, May 21 1940.\n\nQuickly and sudden was the call,\n\nHis sudden death surprised us all;\n\nOnly those who have lost are able to tell\n\nThe pain of a parting without a farewell.\n\nFrom his loving Wife, Sons, and Daughters\n\nMrs Matilda Bradish died in 1985.\n\nillustrations by courtesy of Margaret Fagg\n\nNote: George Town Crepin suffered an accident on 9 December 1910 which fractured one finger and necessitated two others being amputated.

W.\n\nRaymond William Brett, 1807476, was born on 22 November 1923 in Hull, the son of William James and Lillian Louisa Brett, formerly Harding. From 24 Buckland Avenue, he was a former pupil of Barton Road and then the County, now Grammar, Schools, and had worked at the Westminster bank in Dover for nearly two years.\n\nIn 1939 Mr Brett, born 4 August 1895, and Mrs Brett, born 17 October 1900, were living at 24 Buckland Avenue, with Mr Brett working as a Master Builder. Mr Brett had in 1913 been working as a shop boy for Igglesden and Graves, the bakers in the Market Square. During the Great War he served in the RAMC, and amongst his duties helped dispatch the ambulance trains for returning wounded from the Admiralty Pier.\n\nRaymond became a Sergeant Air Gunner, in the RAFVR, 44 Squadron. He flew on a number of different operations, sometimes at an intensity of one a day. On 21 May 1944 he was part of a minelaying operation over Kiel, the following day an operation over Brunswick during which they engaged in combat with a night flyer, claiming its destruction. In June he flew on 4, 5, twice on 6, then on 8, 9, 12, 14, and on 16, which took him to Beauvoirs.\n\nOn 21 June 1944 he took off at 22.58 hours from Dunholme Lodge, Lincolnshire, as part of a force of 133 Lancasters detailed to attack a synthetic oil plant at Wesseling, south of Cologne, Germany. Six de Havilland Mosquitos also took part in the raid.\n\nThe target was obscured by 10/10ths cloud, so bombing was carried out using the H2S radar equipment. The Luftwaffe night-fighter force inflicted heavy casualties on the bombers and contributed to the loss of 37 Lancasters, with six of the losses coming from 44 Squadron. They included Sergeant Brett's Avro Lancaster BIII ND552, coded KM-X, which crashed in the early hours of 22 June into the grounds of a coalmine between the villages of Eisden (Limburg) and Lanklaar in Belgium.\n\nAll the crew were killed, and are buried in the local Communal Cemetery, Collective Grave 1-7.

Casualties on the ground amounted to 20 workers\n\nRaymond Brett is named on his father's headstone at St Peter, Whitfield. The words on the headstone read:\n\nIn loving memory of William James Brett, died 8th Sept 1953 aged 58 years\n\nAlso his son Flt/Sgt Raymond William Brett RAF\n\nKilled in Action 22.6.44 (Buried in Belgium)\n\nNote: William Brett was born at Walmer in 1895 and died in 1953.
