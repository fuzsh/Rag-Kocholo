She built the first ever Marketing and Communication strategy which helped it become the top female participation sport in England, second team participation sport (to men’s football) and even shifted cultural norms for women. It was mission led, put the athletes at the centre and made transformative change.\n\nFor the last 10 years she has been a Director at Intelligent Health, founded by Dr William Bird MBE, where the focus is on tackling inequalities, ill health and climate change through building active communities. Katherine has guided the growth of a mass participation game called Beat the Street that encourages people to improve their health through small changes to daily behaviour – through walking, wheeling and cycling. Typically 10% of a place takes part, with the largest game in Sheffield attracting 60,000 participants – adults and children. Using social marketing and trusted behaviour change techniques it’s become one of the most effective mass behaviour change programmes in public health.\n\nKatherine has led Beat the Street’s national work with Sport England since 2017, building it into a programme that has been taken across England and is now recognised as a transformational tool for places. The programme combines community engagement, behavioural science, data insight, project management and marketing expertise. It all sits on digital platform that allows delivery at scale and leverages innovative technology and gamification.\n\nBeat the Street works like a high-profile mass sports event hosted in a place, but for residents themselves to take part, turning where they live and work into a playground and allowing them to enjoy spending time together whatever their age or ability. It works because it’s easy, accessible simple and timely but most of all it’s fun. For places and partners, it provides access to valuable data that can drive insight for health and the wider system to deliver population level change.\n\nBeat the Street has worked in over 170 places and with 1.8 million participants. Typically, 87% register and of these, 53% are adults and 47% children. With Sport England there have been 57 places and over 730,000 participants. Tackling inequality sits at the heart and data shows a third have joined from IMD 1-2 populations, 71% of adult participants are women, 19% have a disability or long-term condition, and there is over-representation or mirrored Black, Asian and other ethnically diverse groups compared to local data sets. There is an on average an 8% decrease in inactivity for adults following the game phase.\n\nIn her spare time, Katherine is Chair of Rounders England and although she has retired from playing football she still loves heading out for walks with her family and friends.\n\nIntelligent Health\n\nDavid Martin\n\nSenior Vice President\n\nBritish Esports\n\nCurrently serving as the Senior Vice President of British Esports, Dave brings extensive experience and expertise to the national federation.\n\nIn addition to his role at British Esports, Dave holds the position of CEO at Esports Global, an investment and consultancy firm specialising in esports, and served as a Strategic Advisor to FINTECH Circle.\n\nHe also supports operations at Resolve Esports and was formerly co-owner of the London Royal Ravens Call of Duty franchise, further showcasing his multifaceted involvement in the esports industry.\n\nWith over two decades of experience advising the esports and education sectors, Dave has worked closely with government bodies, professional institutions, and employers both in the UK and internationally.\n\nAt British Esports, Dave serves as the Senior Vice President, leveraging his extensive expertise to cultivate relationships with key strategic partners, policymakers, esports organisations, and athletes.
