British real estate investment firm UK Commercial Property REIT (UKCM) agreed the deal with Tri7, a real estate investment and asset management firm. UK Commercial Property REIT Ltd announced that it has sold its 67,000 sq ft office building in Temple Quay to Tri7, a value-add real estate investment and asset management firm.

This marks the fifth project where our seasoned developer has requested funding from our loyal & dedicated investors. One of their most recent & notable successes was the iconic \"22 St John Street\", which was fully renovated to offer 13 ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù private office suites for the bustling business community in the city, and was finished ahead of schedule. This latest project involves the renovation of a 9-story office block in the heart of the city. This 30,000 sq/ft property will be transformed into high-quality serviced offices, complete with hot desks, phone booths, conference rooms, and private workspaces. The refurbished property will boast the most modern ‚Äústate of art‚Äù amenities to satisfy the most demanding of tenants with the added advantage of underground parking which is a rarity in central Manchester. This excellent development is one not to be missed. The developer seeks an equity investment of ¬£2.6m with a minimum ¬£100k investment into the project, in return for an equity spilt of 50% of profit. The investor shares will be secured in a SPV over an 24 month period, 12 months for the refurbishment & 12 months to fill with tenants - exit strategy is to either develop & hold or develop & sell once fully let.
