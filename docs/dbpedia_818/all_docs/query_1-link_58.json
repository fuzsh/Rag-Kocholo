        "text": "TSX (TerraSAR-X) Mission\n\nSpacecraft Launch Mission Status Sensor Complement Secondary Payloads Ground Segment References\n\nTerraSAR-X1 (also referred to as TSX or TSX-1) is a German SAR satellite mission for scientific and commercial applications (national project). The project is supported by BMBF (German Ministry of Education and Science) and managed by DLR (German Aerospace Center). In 2002, EADS Astrium GmbH was awarded a contract to implement the X-band TerraSAR satellite (TerraSAR-X) on the basis of a public-private partnership agreement (PPP). In this arrangement, EADS Astrium funded part of the implementation cost of the TerraSAR-X system.\n\nIn exchange, EADS Astrium/Infoterra received exclusive commercial exploitation rights for the TerraSAR-X data. The satellite is owned and operated by DLR, and the scientific data rights remain with DLR. The satellite has a design life of at least five years. TerraSAR-X is of SIR-C/X-SAR (1994) and SRTM (2000) heritage - DLR SAR instruments flown on Shuttle missions.\n\nThe science objectives are to make multi-mode and high-resolution X-band data available for a wide spectrum of scientific applications in such fields as:\n\nhydrology,\n\ngeology,\n\nclimatology,\n\noceanography,\n\nenvironmental and disaster monitoring,\n\ncartography (DEM generation) making use of interferometry and stereometry.\n\nThe science potential of the mission is given by:\n\nThe high geometric and radiometric resolution (experimental 300 MHz Mode for very high range resolution)\n\nThe single, dual and quad polarization mode capability\n\nThe capability of multi-temporal imaging\n\nThe capability of repeat-pass interferometry\n\nThe capability of ATI (Along-Track Interferometry)\n\nThe business goal in this venture is to establish a commercial EO (Earth Observation) market by Infoterra on a sustainable service concept to its customer base. Infoterra, a subsidiary of EADS Astrium, is comprised of Infoterra Ltd. in Farnborough, UK, and Infoterra GmbH in Friedrichshafen, Germany (a subsidiary of EADS Astrium GmbH). Infoterra has established a global distribution network with a range of service options for its customers.\n\nA commercial goal is also to provide monitoring services for the European initiative GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security).\n\nSpacecraft\n\nThe TerraSAR X-band satellite, built by Airbus Defence and Space Geo-Intelligence/Infoterra GmbH (formerly EADS Astrium GmbH, Friedrichshafen, Germany) employs a mission-tailored AstroSat-1000 bus (successor of Flexbus and LEOSTAR due to industrial merger - initially AstroSat-1000 was referred to as AstroBus) concept with a heritage of CHAMP and GRACE missions.\n\nThe hexagonal outer shape of the spacecraft, with a total height of about 5 m and a diameter of about 2.4 m, is mainly driven by the accommodation of the SAR instrument, the body-mounted solar array, and the geometrical limitations given by the Dnepr-1 launcher fairing.\n\nThe S/C bus design features a central hexagonal CFRP structure as the main load-carrying element. The cross-sectional view of Figure 6 illustrates the mounting concept of the radiator, solar array, and SAR antenna elements. Three sides of the hexagon are populated with electronic equipment, while the sun-facing side is additionally carrying the solar array.\n\nThe SAR antenna is mounted on one of the hexagon sides, which in flight attitude points 33.8º off the nadir. The other nadir-looking side is reserved for the accommodation of an S-band TT&C antenna, a SAR data downlink antenna - carried by a deployable boom of 3.3 m length in order to avoid RF interferences during simultaneous radar imaging and data transmission to the ground - and a Laser Retro Reflector to support precise orbit determination. The deep-space-looking surface is used for the LCT (Laser Communication Terminal) and as a thermal radiator. The total wet mass of the satellite is about 1230 kg.\n\nThe solar array is of size 5.25 m2, and triple-junction GaAs type solar cells provide an average orbital power of 800 W EOL. The attitude control system is based on reaction wheels for fine-pointing, with magnetorquers for desaturation, and a propulsion system also capable of attitude control in order to achieve rapid rate damping during initial acquisition.\n\nAttitude measurement is performed with a GPS/Star Tracker system (MosaicGNSS) during nominal operation and a CESS (Coarse Earth and Sun Sensor) in safe mode situations, initial acquisition respectively (CESS is of CHAMP and GRACE heritage). A combination of an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and a magnetometer serve to support rate measurements in all mission phases. In fine pointing mode, a pointing accuracy of 65 arcsecs is achieved (3 σ). Nominal attitude control follows a novel “total zero Doppler steering” law developed by DLR.\n\nPrecise orbit determination is performed with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and raw data post-processing on ground, permitting orbit restitution accuracies in the cm range. A set of high torque reaction wheels enables rapid rotation into the so-called SSL (Sun Side Looking) orientation which is used to acquire high-priority imaging targets. To point the SAR antenna in the SSL direction, a roll movement of 67.6º is required which is achieved in < 180 s.\n\nThe MosaicGNSS receiver of EADS Astrium represents a fully space-qualified receiver that is specifically designed for high robustness and long-term use in a space environment. The receiver comprises a main electronic unit, a single L1 GPS patch antenna and an external low-noise amplifier. The signal correlation is performed in software and up to eight satellites can be tracked simultaneously with the current hardware configuration. A navigation filter ensures a smooth and continuous navigation solution even under restricted GPS visibility.\n\nIn the upcoming TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X missions, the MosaicGNSS receiver supports the onboard timing and provides the basic orbital information for aligning the spacecraft with the ground track and nadir direction. MosaicGNSS navigation solutions will also be transmitted via an inter-satellite link between both spacecraft to support autonomous formation flying and collision avoidance. For precise orbit determination and baseline reconstruction, both spacecraft are equipped with dedicated dual-frequency GPS receivers IGOR (Integrated Geodetic and Occultation Receiver).\n\nFurthermore, the MosaicGNSS receiver serves as an alternative for precise orbit determination in case the IGOR receiver would fail to work. To support this task, a full set of raw measurements is made available in the housekeeping telemetry in addition to the real-time navigation solution. The comprehensive measurement set and the availability of a geodetic grade reference receiver offer a unique opportunity to characterize the in-flight performance of the MosaicGNSS receiver.\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a monopropellant hydrazine blow-down mode propulsion system for orbit maintenance and safe mode attitude control. A propellant mass of 78 kg is considered sufficient for almost 10 years of orbit maintenance support.\n\nOnboard data handling: The newly developed ICDE (Integrated Control and Data System Electronics) system is being used as the central component for all avionics services. The ICDE core consists of two redundant 32-bit processor modules, implementing the ATMEL ERC32SC (Embedded Real‐time computing Core ‐ 32-bit Single Chip) processor, giving it a processing performance of more than 18 MIPS and enough memory capacity to handle full AOCS and data handling software tasks, leaving sufficient margins in performance and memory capacity for future extensions and redundancy concepts. A dedicated, hot-redundant reconfiguration module provides all necessary surveillance, reconfiguration, command and telemetry functions. The ICDE modules are cross-coupled, providing a fully redundant unit.\n\nThe ICDE provides the spacecraft and payload interfaces with the following standard link protocols: MIL-1553 bus, HDLC and SpaceWire. An optional GPS receiver module with optional star sensor processing fits seamlessly into the architecture. It is capable of acquiring and independently tracking up to eight GPS satellites and provides position, velocity and time.\n\nThe ICDE uses full duplex UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interfaces to all ”intelligent” onboard equipment, except for the LCT experiment, where a MIL-STD-1553B bus is being used. The ICDE has a mass budget of 12-18 kg and a power demand of 15-30 W, depending on the configuration selected.\n\nThe spacecraft design life is 5 years for operations with a goal of 6.5 years (de-orbiting is planned at the end of the useful lifetime).\n\nOrbit: Sun-synchronous circular dawn-dusk orbit with a local time of ascending node at 18:00 hours (± 0.25 h) equatorial crossing, average altitude = 514.8 km (505-533 km), inclination = 97.44º, nominal revisit period of 11 days (167 orbits within revisit period, 15 2/11 orbits per day). The ground track repeatability is within ± 500 m per revisit period (repeat cycle). Due to its flexibility, TerraSAR-X can cover any point on Earth within a maximum of 4.5 days, and 90% of the surface within 2 days.\n\nSpacecraft reentry (ESA requirement): At the end of its operational life the spacecraft orbit will be lowered to about 300 km (perigee) resulting eventually in enough air drag for a reentry (and a complete fragmentation and destruction of the S/C in the atmosphere).\n\nRF communications: A standard S-band TT&C system with 360º coverage in uplink and downlink is used for satellite command reception and telemetry transmission. The uplink path is encrypted. Generated payload (SAR) data are stored onboard in an SSMM (Solid State Mass Memory) unit of 256 Gbit EOL capacity prior to transmission via the XDA (X-band Downlink Assembly) at a data rate of 300 Mbit/s. The X-band downlink is encrypted. The onboard SAR raw data are compressed using the BAQ (Block Adaptive Quantization) algorithm, a standard SAR procedure. The compression factor is selectable between 8/6, 8/4, 8/3 or 8/2 (more efficient techniques can only be applied to processed SAR imagery).\n\nBoth communication links are designed according to the ESA CCSDS Packet Telemetry Standard.\n\n- The X-band antenna is mounted on a deployable boom 3.3 m in length (the only deployable item on the S/C) to prevent interference with the X-band SAR instrument. This arrangement enables simultaneous SAR observations and X-band downlink.\n\nIn preparation for the TanDEM-X mission, where the TerraSAR-X satellite will fly in close constellation with TanDEM-X (an identical S/C) for interferometric observations, the TerraSAR-X instrument is furnished with all necessary features for PRF and synchronization between the two spacecraft. In particular, there are 6 sync horns for the omnidirectional emission and reception of radar sync pulses.\n\nTable 1: Overview of the TerraSAR-X1 spacecraft characteristics\n\nLaunch: The successful launch of TerraSAR-X took place on June 15, 2007, from the Russian Cosmodrome, Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on a Russian/Ukrainian Dnepr-1 launch vehicle with a 1.5 m long fairing extension. Launch provider: ISC Kosmotras, Moscow.\n\n- The launch, originally planned for Oct. 31, 2006, had to be shifted several times after an unsuccessful launch of a rocket of the same type in the summer of 2006. The single cause of this launch mishap was discovered and properly corrected.\n\nA Data Repository and Research Subject\n\n- Over its lifetime, TerraSAR-X has acquired more than 400,000 radar images, collecting 1.34 petabytes (1.34 x 1015 bytes) of data in the process. This is equivalent to 1,340,000 gigabytes or the streaming of around 270,000 high-definition feature films, which would take around 60 years to run through.\n\nThe satellite’s legacy is becoming more comprehensive, more valuable and more widely used every day. More than 1100 leading researchers from 64 countries are now drawing upon and processing its data as part of 1875 ongoing research projects. Not only does the range of applications encompass the full spectrum of geosciences, including geology, glaciology, oceanography, meteorology and hydrology, but the radar data are also essential for environmental research, land use mapping, vegetation monitoring, and urban and infrastructure planning. Cartography, navigation, logistics, crisis management and defence and security also rely on TerraSAR-X data.\n\n- The satellite itself is the subject of research and development as well, particularly in the field of radar technology. With its flexible design, the radar system enables experiments to be conducted using new imaging modes such as a 'super wide angle' and 'super zoom', similar to a camera being fitted with different lenses. Officially referred to as 'WideScanSAR' and 'Staring Spotlight Mode', these were introduced during the course of the mission and then made available to users. The satellite continues to conduct radar experiments to test new techniques that might be used on future radar missions.\n\nA Third Dimension with TanDEM-X\n\n- Since 21 June 2010, TerraSAR-X has been accompanied by the TanDEM-X satellite, which is almost identical in design. TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X form the first reconfigurable Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometer in space, recording precise height information for creating digital elevation models.\n\nThis means that TerraSAR-X is now being used for two missions – the original TerraSAR-X mission and the TanDEM-X mission for three-dimensional mapping of Earth’s surface.\n\n- Despite its unprecedented longevity, the day will eventually come when TerraSAR-X is no longer able to fulfil its tasks. Resources such as propellant and battery capacity are steadily being depleted. However, if there are no major incidents, TerraSAR-X could remain in operation until the end of the 2020s.\n\nEnvironmental Observation in Future – Tandem-L\n\n- With the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellite missions, DLR has set new standards in radar remote sensing. Its experts are already working on the next generation of radar satellites for climate research and environmental monitoring, in the form of Tandem-L, a highly innovative radar satellite mission. This could see Germany provide a system for the objective recording of the environment and the observation of environmental changes all over the world.\n\nThe goal is to provide critical information to tackle highly relevant issues. For example, the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for the development of climate protection measures and the review of measures taken on a global scale, as a matter of urgency.\n\n- With Tandem-L, it would be possible to record a large number of dynamic processes in the biosphere, geosphere, cryosphere and hydrosphere with unprecedented quality and resolution. The new satellite constellation could provide up-to-date 3D imaging of Earth's entire landmass on a weekly basis and measure seven essential climate variables simultaneously.\n\nIn doing so, Tandem-L would make a significant contribution towards a better understanding of processes that are now seen as drivers of local and global climate change.\n\nBig Data for Earth Observation\n\n- The satellite has already delivered 303,714 images. The data is received via a global network of ground stations and processed and evaluated by experts at the DLR Earth Observation Center (EOC). Even the first analyses document indisputable details of climate change, including the retreat of glaciers across the globe. Approximately 1000 scientists from more than 50 countries are now using the data for their research – and demand is on the rise.\n\nGlobal radar images are of particular value to environmental and climate research. DLR ensures access to the images in the long term in the German Satellite Data Archive in Oberpfaffenhofen.\n\n- During this time, GSOC (German Space Operations Center) sent more than 1.85 million commands to TerraSAR-X, and an additional 1.4 million commands to control the orbiting TanDEM-X satellite. A particular challenge, both during the development and in operation, was and is the 'double-helix dance' of the two radar satellites.\n\nThe tightest flight formation between TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X was at a distance of 120 m distance perpendicular to the direction of flight – at an average speed of 7.6 km/s. The exceptional performance and success of the mission are not least down to the close interdisciplinary collaboration within DLR. In Oberpfaffenhofen, almost 100 staff from four DLR institutes have combined their expertise such that they have mastered the entire process chain of the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X mission for 10 years now.\n\nThe future\n\n- The exceptional life of the satellite has been possible thanks to careful operation and robust construction. Only about half of the fuel supply has been consumed and the performance level of the batteries is approximately 72 per cent, so the experts expect TerraSAR-X will continue to operate for another five years.\n\nThe twin satellite TanDEM-X also shows no signs of fatigue, meaning that more high-resolution elevation images will be generated and the global data set will be enhanced by autumn 2017. The focus is on areas undergoing strong processes of change, and are therefore of particular scientific interest. These include the coastal regions of the Antarctic, Greenland and the permafrost regions, and the Amazon rainforest.\n\nWith regard to the extent and effect of climate change, Tandem-L could provide important information that is still lacking – for improved scientific forecasts and the social and political recommendations for action that are based on this. The concept builds on the experience and exceptional success of the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X missions. If the mission proposal gets the 'green light', Tandem-L will take radar remote sensing into the next era of technology and applications in 2022.\n\n- With the X-band SAR family, Germany has developed a globally recognized expertise and a unique selling point for decades. In order to ensure this leadership role in the future, the continuation of the X-Band family is being carried out at the DLR Space Administration. The future lies in an even higher resolution with wider observation swaths. This is intended to continuously provide the scientific, governmental and commercial stakeholders with data.\n\nMission Status\n\n• June 14, 2022: The German radar satellite TerraSAR-X celebrates its 15th anniversary in space on 15 June 2022. TerraSAR-X allows researchers worldwide to document and better understand the changes on our planet. TerraSAR-X serves two missions — the TerraSAR-X mission and the TanDEM-X mission for three-dimensional mapping of Earth's surface. Experts are already working on the next generation of radar satellites for climate research and environmental observation — Tandem-L. After 15 years in operation, TerraSAR-X has completed 83,050 orbits of Earth, having travelled approximately 3.59 billion kilometres.\n\n• The TerraSAR-X spacecraft and its payload were operating nominally in 2013.\n\n• November 2012: Since January 2011, the Earth under the Santorini volcano has been stirring. Most of the time, it is barely noticeable, but every now and then the inhabitants notice small tremors jolting the volcanic archipelago. Nearly circular, and seemingly carved from stone, the submerged caldera is located in the Aegean Sea (Mediterranean, Greece). Funded by the UK National Environment Research Council, radar specialist Juliet Biggs, Parks and volcanologist David Pyle (University of Oxford) began to study the Santorini volcano closely. Using GPS receivers, they determined precise locations with millimetric accuracy on a daily basis. The TerraSAR-X radar satellite also observed the archipelago from orbit, at an altitude of 514 km, recording its uplift and expansion from one orbit to the next. The results showed that the Kameni islands had risen 8 to 14 cm in many places. The breadth of the caldera as a whole has increased by about 14 cm since early 2011.\n\n- In the analysis of the radar data, the red and yellow shading shows the areas where the ground has risen the most. The main island of Thira is unaffected by the deformation, thus appearing blue. The researchers believe that a magma chamber has formed at a depth of 4 km. They must now combine the information on the volcano's present behaviour with the knowledge of previous eruptions. The TerraSAR-X radar satellite has provided important information in this regard.\n\n• October 2012: Figure 29 is the TerraSAR-X image of the month. The image was acquired on June 23, 2009. The scene measures 50 km x 30 km. TerraSAR-X also cast a penetrating eye on the around 2000 m high mountains and the salt lake, which lies at an altitude of some 1270 m. The image shows rough surfaces in orange and smooth ones in grey/black. - The large, black surface bordering the industrial area in the middle of the image is the Wendover Facility. The large-scale industrial extraction of brine takes place here, which is needed for manufacturing potash.\n\n• June 15, 2012, the TerraSAR-X mission completed its 5th year on orbit. Designed to operate for five years, the satellite had now completed its nominal service life but it remains in excellent condition; it is expected to continue functioning for several more years. The TerraSAR-X satellite mission has successfully supported or enabled a wide range of relief efforts and projects. Since June 2010, the satellite has been in good company; TerraSAR-X has been orbiting the Earth in close formation with its almost identical twin, TanDEM-X. Together, they are creating a highly accurate digital elevation model of Earth. With its own unchanged mission targets still in focus, TerraSAR-X has been meeting all expectations here as well (Ref. 55).\n\n• January 2012: The TerraSAR-X satellite was fully operational and continuous its close formation flight with the TanDEM-X spacecraft. After a year of formation flight of TerraSAR-X, with TanDEM-X, the twin satellites had completely mapped the entire land surface of Earth for the first time. The data is being used to create the world's first single-source, high-precision, 3D digital elevation model of Earth. DLR controls both radar satellites, generates the elevation model, and is responsible for the scientific use of TanDEM-X data.\n\n- Ice and snow can be colourful - when observed by TerraSAR-X. The radar signals are able to penetrate the snow cover to a depth of one ~ 1 meter – and the subsurface reflects the pulse in different ways. This makes the frozen delta of the Mackenzie River in Canada appear multi-coloured in an image revealing the various structures in the landscape underneath the snow. The colourful winter landscape serves a particular purpose for researchers, as they can use various images of the same region to track movement – when the river landscape freezes, when the ice sheet begins to break up again and when the thaw begins. The duration and intensity of this icy period are important indicators for climate research.\n\n• January 2011, TerraSAR-X is fully operational and in close formation flight with the TanDEM-X spacecraft. The two spacecraft provide a single-pass interferometric configuration, which was declared operational in December 2010. The collection of data for a global homogeneous DEM started - as planned - in early 2011.Figure 31 is the image of the month of July 2011 of TerraSAR-X. The Puyehue volcano erupted on June 4, 2011, in the southern Andes mountains. A field of lava, appearing as a uniform, light blue surface, is currently forming there. Radar images acquired by TerraSAR-X have been providing valuable information to the staff of the Chilean Volcano Risk Program since the eruption began, helping them to assess the situation and predict its future development.\n\n• The TerraSAR-X spacecraft and its payload were operating nominally as of 2010.\n\n• January 2010: Imagery of the TerraSAR-X spacecraft as well as optical imagery from other spacecraft was being used by a DLR/DFD analysis team to support the disaster relief activities of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on Jan. 12, 2010. Satellite-based maps were generated of the stricken region and provided to the relief organisations via the internet. In the absence of any or very little information, the current state of the infrastructure in the capital city of Port-au-Prince was of great service to the relief workers. The quickly generated reference maps were giving an overview of the road network as well as of important buildings and facilities such as the airport as they were before and after the earthquake.\n\n• October/November 2009: high-resolution TerraSAR-X data were acquired in Antarctica in the left-looking observation mode. The areas of scientific interest were located within glacier basins and ice streams that flow through the Transantarctic Mountains and into the Ross Ice Shelf. Detailed ice velocity patterns on the Nimrod glacier basin and Starshot glacier were studied.\n\n• Summer 2009: two years after launch, two dedicated calibration campaigns were performed, one for the re-calibration of TerraSAR-X, and one for the experimental DRA (Dual Receive Antenna) mode. The effective and exact calibration techniques already successfully applied for the commissioning of TerraSAR-X in 2007 have shown once again how accurately the complex TerraSAR-X system can be adjusted. Moreover, by deriving the stability of the whole SAR system by real measurements two years after launch, the accuracy could be improved further on. - In total, 40 campaigns against reference targets and about 150 acquisitions across the Amazon rainforest were successfully executed and evaluated. The stability and the accuracy of the whole TerraSAR-X system and especially the radar instrument itself is still of unprecedented quality.\n\n• 2009: the measurement of ground object motions with the SAR ATI (Along-Track Interferometry) data acquisition capability was demonstrated from a spaceborne SAR instrument in different contexts, two typical applications are traffic flows and water surface currents.\n\n- With regard to traffic flow, the focus lies on detecting a number of small (compared to the image resolution) separate moving objects to derive traffic information for a whole area or larger sections of a road network from it. With its large-area data acquisition and weather and daylight independence, SAR offers great potential to augment existing networks of traffic sensors or sometimes to be the only source of traffic data. This TTP (TerraSAR-X Traffic Processor) includes SAR focusing, vehicle detection and measurement for public roads as well as the generation of an easily distributable traffic data product. Road data are extracted from a database for the processed scene and enable to restrict processing to only relevant image areas, to enhance moving object signatures by adaptive filtering of the SAR data and to provide velocity measurements for detected objects based on azimuth displacement.\n\n•Spring 2009: The TerraSAR-X spacecraft and its payload are operating nominally in 2009. Spacecraft and ground segment are fully operational. Image products (Spotlight, Stripmap, ScanSAR) are calibrated and released. The product quality is within initial specification or better. Operation of the SAR instrument proved to be very stable. Demonstrations accomplished: Repeat pass interferometry, along-track interferometry, persistent scatterer evaluation, TOPSAR (while TOPSAR was demonstrated, implementation is pending), total zero Doppler steering, and demonstration of quadpol mode. Demonstration of quadpol mode. The use of TerraSAR-X data was demonstrated for geoscientific applications, oceanography and disaster monitoring during the commissioning phase.\n\n• February 16, 2009: TOR (Tracking, Occultation and Ranging) payload radio occultation measurements were activated permanently onboard TerraSAR-X. The IGOR receiver of TOR was powered up shortly shortly after deployment of the TerraSAR-X mission delivering continuous tracking data for POD (Precise Orbit Determination) support. The radio occultation measurements (TOR-RO) were enabled for a test period of 4 weeks from January 15 through February 15, 2008. This campaign yielded a daily total of about 250 neutral atmospheric profiles for temperature and humidity as well as additional ionospheric data of the vertical electron density distribution. SLR measurements tracking the TerraSAR-X spacecraft are being regularly performed by the global SLR community. The ranging campaign yielded a total of 735 laser passes for a period between June 16, 2007, and Oct. 1, 2007. Single shot accuracies of 3-4 cm are being reported from the specially equipped ground station at Graz, Austria.\n\n• January/February 2008: LCTSX (LCT on TerraSAR-X) FSO (Free Space Optics) communication demonstrations: In a series of ISL (Intersatellite Link) tests, the LCT (Laser Communication Terminal) on TerraSAR-X as well as the one flown on the DoD NFIRE (Near Field Infrared Experiment) spacecraft, have exchanged data simultaneously at rates of 5.625 Gbit/s ((equivalent to ~200,000 A4-pages per second). According to Tesat-Spacecom GmbH, it has taken < 25 seconds, on average, for the terminals to lock onto each other and begin transmissions. A key feature of the system is its ability to establish and maintain a link, even when the sun is directly behind the target spacecraft.\n\n- The first LEO-LEO inter-satellite link was performed above the Pacific Ocean near Central America. Continuous free-space optical transmissions were maintained for as long as the two spacecraft were within the line-of-sight position of each other (both spacecraft in LEO) amounting to about 20 minutes on an average pass. On these free-space transmissions, the measured BER (Bit Error Rate) was < 10-9. Since the NFIRE spacecraft is not producing its own imagery, a closed-loop link was configured where the data from TerraSAR-X was directly re-transmitted from NFIRE to establish “duplex operations” at 5.625 Gbit/s. - Further tests are planned with transmissions to ground stations in Germany and in Spain.\n\n- The orbits of the two LEO satellites (TerraSAR-X and NFIRE) propagated in opposite directions to each other. This required the LCT to track its counter terminal across an azimuth range of about 80º. The elevation range was about 10º. The link distance varied between 3,700 km and 4,700 km, with a maximum range rate of 8,500 m/s. As was verified in later experiments the pointing accuracy of the LCT allows closing spatial acquisition between NFIRE and TerraSAR-X significantly faster than 10 s. Frequency acquisition has been optimized to lock the phases within 20 s. The bit error rate was always better than 10-9\n\n.• December 13, 2007: A successful ORR (Operational Readiness Review) of TerraSAR-X took place with all systems tested and validated - and with nominal operations of the spacecraft. The mission was officially declared operational on January 7, 2008. Scientists and engineers from DLR and EADS Astrium had spent the past few months calibrating and commissioning the satellite. The results of calibrating TerraSAR-X approve the accuracy calculated before launch and put the described strategy to calibrate efficiently a multiple mode SAR system like TerraSAR-X on a solid base. All requirements and/or goals had been achieved for the project. The SAR products were operationally released 5.5 months after launch. This was possible due to an intensive combined test program of the ground segment and the space segment. The CP (Commissioning Phase) planning tool allowed flexible planning and re-planning throughout the CP. Over 12000 DTs (Data Takes), i.e. scenes, were acquired and processed.\n\n- The main objectives of the CP were the calibration and verification of the entire SAR system chain in order to achieve the specified SAR image and product quality as well as the operationalization and validation of the ground segment functions. This involved in particular the tuning and adjustment of the TMSP (TerraSAR-X Multi-Mode SAR Processor) to meet the in-orbit data characteristics and to optimize the SAR focusing results. The TMSP consistently generates phase-preserving SSC (Single-look Slant-range Complex) data sets from the imaging modes Stripmap, ScanSAR and Spotlight for all specified polarization modes. Derivation of multi-look detected products (MGD, GEC and EEC) is based on SSCs as an interim production stage\n\n• November 2007: A bistatic X-band experiment was successfully performed. TerraSAR-X (TSX) was used as the transmitter and DLR's new airborne radar system F-SAR, was programmed to acquire data in a quasi-continuous mode to avoid echo window synchronization issues. The F-SAR system was used as a bistatic receiver in this configuration. Precise phase and time referencing between both system was derived during the bistatic processing. The experiment was considered a success after data analysis. For the first time, a spaceborne-airborne X-band acquisition had been successfully conducted, including high-resolution SAR processing. The bistatic image shows an improved resolution, SNR and no range ambiguities, as well as a different perspective of the imaged scene.\n\n• October/November 2007: Demonstration of the novel TOPSAR (Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan) SAR operations support mode concept on TerraSAR-X (on behalf of ESA). The TOPSAR technique employs a very simple counter-rotation of the radar beam in the opposite direction to a “spot observation”; hence, the name TOPS (Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan). The first TOPSAR images and interferometric results were demonstrated on the TerraSAR-X spacecraft during the commissioning phase in the fall of 2007. TerraSAR-X was able to provide this demonstration because its TSX-SAR instrument because it was able to electronically steer the antenna azimuth pattern. This capability, together with the high flexibility of the satellite commanding, provided the opportunity to implement on the satellite the TOPSAR acquisition mode.\n\n- TOPSAR is an ESA-proposed acquisition mode for wide swath imaging which aims at reducing the drawbacks of the ScanSAR mode. The basic principle of TOPSAR is the shrinking of the azimuth antenna pattern (along-track direction) as seen by a target on ground. This is obtained by steering the antenna in the opposite direction as for Spotlight. The TOPSAR mode is intended to replace the conventional ScanSAR mode. The technique aims at achieving the same coverage and resolution as ScanSAR, but with a nearly uniform SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and DTAR (Distributed Target Ambiguity Ratio).\n\n• June 19, 2007: Contact with the spacecraft was established shortly after launch. All systems were functioning nominally. All standard imaging modes (strip, spot & scan) were exercised in this early phase. Hence, LEOP (Launch and Early Orbit Phase) was successfully completed on June 21, 2007. Thereafter, TerraSAR-X was put into its commissioning phase; it was expected to remain in this status until the end of 2007. During this survey, a thick cloud cover prevailed. Nevertheless, radar satellites such as TerraSAR-X offer imaging capability even in the case of cloudy skies and at night. However, exceptional strong precipitation events like heavy thunderstorms may influence even radar imaging. Such an event can be seen at the upper left part of the radar image as a bright ”veil”.\n\nSensor Complement\n\nTSX-SAR (TerraSAR-X SAR instrument). TSX-SAR is an active phased array X-band antenna system providing high-resolution and multi-polarization SAR imagery (H and V), permitting the operational modes of “stripmap,” “spotlight,” and “scanSAR.” The beam-forming capability and quality of the active phased array technology introduce a range of flexibility, permitting the acquisition of high-resolution imagery as well as wide-swath imagery. The active phased array front-end is structured in azimuth direction (along-track) into three antenna leafs, each comprised of four antenna panels. One antenna panel is made up of 32 active sub-arrays in elevation, each comprising an HP (Horizontal Polarization) and a VP (Vertical Polarization) slotted waveguide radiator. Each of the 384 sub-arrays (32 x 12) is equipped with a T/R (Transmit/Receive) module - also referred to as TRM. The dual-polarized waveguide radiator allows polarization selection via a polarization switch in the T/R module (TRM). In toggle mode, it can switch the polarization from pulse to pulse. This allows for the simultaneous acquisition of two image polarizations.\n\nThe front end is controlled by ACE (Antenna Control Electronics), providing programmable real-time control of the antenna beam shape, pointing and polarization in transmission, and reception. For each commanded antenna beam, one of 256 stored elevation beam configurations is combined with one of 256 azimuth beam configurations; the resulting excitation coefficients are transferred to the T/R modules. Beam steering in azimuth (± 0,75º) and elevation (± 20º) is performed by ACE, which provides programmable real-time control of antenna beam shape, pointing and polarization in transmission and reception. The switching of an antenna beam can take place at a maximum rate of 275 Hz. ACE is controlled by CE (Control Electronics), consisting of DCE (Data & Control Electronics), ICU (Instrument Control Unit) and RFE (Radio Frequency Electronics). RFE contains the USO (Ultra Stable Oscillator), the up- and down-conversion and preamplifying stages and provides programmable signals for internal calibration.\n\nCE provides the following functions:\n\n• Generation and transmission of the Tx signal\n\n• Reception and A/D conversion of the Rx signal\n\n• SAR data buffering, compression and formatting\n\n• Instrument timing and control.\n\nThe transmit signal is produced in a digital chirp generator. An AWG (Arrayed Waveguide Grating) writes up to 8 different waveforms of commanded length and a bandwidth of up to 300 MHz in a waveform memory. One of these 8 waveforms is selected for each pulse and can be switched from pulse to pulse. In the receive path, one of three anti-aliasing filters which are matching to the ADC sampling rates of 110, 165 or 330 MHz, can be selected. The data are compressed online with a BAQ algorithm after the time extension buffering. The BAQ processing works on blocks of 128 consecutive samples with a selectable compression rate of 8 to 4, 3, or 2 bits per sample. A transparent mode also allows bypassing of data compression.\n\nThe TSX-SAR instrument elements are fully redundant, i.e. a main and a redundant functional chain exists. This feature makes it possible to activate both functional chains at the same time, one being the master for timing purposes, thus permitting operations in an experimental DRA (Dual Receive Antenna) mode where the echoes from the azimuth antenna halves can be received and then separated during ground processing, e.g. to serve the application of ATI (Along Track Interferometry). For ATI support the SAR antenna can be grouped into two segments, each of 2.4 m.\n\nDue to the bistatic configuration (one transmitting antenna, two receiving antenna elements), the effective ATI baseline is half antenna separation, i.e. 1.2 m, which corresponds to a time lag of 0.17 ms. Ideal ATI time lags for oceanic current measurements at X-band should be on the order of a few milliseconds, i.e. about 20 times longer than this; thus, the sensitivity of TSX-SAR to small current variations will be quite low. The ATI feature permits the measurement of surface currents with a spatial resolution of about 1 to 2 km.\n\nTable 6: TSX-SAR instrument parameters\n\nTSX-SAR provides a variety of Spotlight, Stripmap and ScanSAR image products. The full operator access to the active phased array antenna together with the 300 MHz modes allows for a large number of custom-designed high-performance image products.\n\nThe spotlight mode is realized on a “sliding spotlight operation” concept. Compared to the starring spotlight operation, the sliding spotlight has the advantage of more uniform NESZ (Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero) performance achieved in the along-track direction due to the averaging of the gain variation of the main beam in azimuth. The signal bandwidth is maintained constant for the whole incidence angle range in order to provide a constant slant range resolution.\n\nParameter/Operational mode\n\nSpotlight\n\nHS mode\n\nSpotlight\n\nSL mode\n\nExperimental Spotlight\n\nStripmap mode (SM)\n\nScanSAR mode (SC)\n\nResolution, cross-track\n\nResolution, along-track\n\n2 m\n\n1 m\n\n2 m\n\n1 m\n\n1 m\n\n1 m\n\n3 m\n\n3 m\n\n16 m\n\n16 m\n\nProduct coverage, (km)\n\nalong-track x cross-track\n\n5 x 10\n\n10 x 10\n\n5 x 10\n\n≤ 1500x 30\n\n≤ 1500x 100\n\nAccess range of incidence angles (full performance)\n\n20-55º\n\n2 x 463 km\n\n20-55º\n\n2 x 463 km\n\n20-55º\n\n2 x 463 km\n\n20-45º\n\n2 x 287 km\n\n20-45º\n\n2 x 287 km\n\nAccess range of incidence angles (data collection)\n\n15-60º\n\n2 x 622 km\n\n15-60º\n\n2 x 622 km\n\n15-60º\n\n2 x 622 km\n\n15-60º\n\n2 x 622 km\n\n20-60º\n\n2 x 577 km\n\nSensitivity NESZ\n\n- typical\n\n- worst case\n\n-23 dB\n\n-19 dB\n\n-23 dB\n\n-19 dB\n\n-20 dB\n\n-16 dB\n\n-22 dB\n\n-19 dB\n\n-21 dB\n\n-19 dB\n\nDTAR ambiguity ratio\n\n< -17 dB\n\n< -17 dB\n\n< -17 dB\n\n< -17 dB\n\n< -17 dB\n\nSource data rate, (8/4 BAQ)\n\n340 Mbit/s\n\n340 Mbit/s\n\n680 Mbit/s\n\n580 Mbit/s\n\n580 Mbit/s\n\nTable 7: Performance overview of the TSX-SAR instrument products\n\nThe primary image performance parameters, provided in Table 7, are NESZ (Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero) and DTAR (Distributed Target Signal to Ambiguity Ratio). They show performance variations within the image as well as over the incidence angle range. NESZ is that value of sigma nought (σo) of a uniform scene that produces a processor output signal to noise of unity. The “access range” is the cross-track accessible (viewable) range on the ground provided by electronic beam steering. The instantaneous range of TSX-SAR is e.g. 30 km (max) in stripmap mode and 100 km for ScanSAR mode. In Stripmap operation, the synthetic aperture is typically given by the -3dB beamwidth of the antenna azimuth pattern defining the processed Doppler bandwidth. In order to provide sufficient performance swath width near the nadir, a broadening of the elevation beamwidth is needed. This is achieved by amplitude/phase tapering of the active antenna.\n\nTSX-SAR Operations and Support Modes\n\n• TSX-SAR is capable to image on either side of the subsatellite track, this is accomplished by a roll maneuver of the spacecraft. The S/C roll feature extends the FOR (Field of Regard) of the instrument for possible event coverage. However, observations to the right side of the subsatellite track are considered to be the preferred (and default) operations mode, due to power constraints in the left-side configuration (the solar array isn't pointing into the sun anymore; also, the communications link to the ground is obstructed).\n\n• There are also experimental dual-receive modes for wide bandwidth (300 MHz), providing even higher resolution, as well as for full polarization and along-track interferometry (ATI), the latter two being achieved by splitting the receive antenna into two azimuth halves (split-antenna stripmap mode). The dual-receive mode provides the potential for ATI velocity measurements of ocean currents, and a full polarimetric mode, by receiving simultaneously the H and V components with the two apertures (the dual-receive mode is also being used to demonstrate traffic velocity measurements on highways). The redundancy concept in the TerraSAR-X receiving chain and the front-end design offers the possibility to use the second spare receiving channel in parallel to the main receiving channel.\n\n• Capability of repeat-pass as well as Along Track Interferometry (ATI)\n\n• Support of four imaging modes: Stripmap, ScanSAR, High-resolution Spotlight, and Spotlight\n\n- SM (Stripmap Mode). The ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses while the antenna beam is fixed in elevation and azimuth. This results in an image strip with continuous image quality in azimuth.\n\n- SC (ScanSAR Mode). SC mode provides a large area coverage. The wider swath is achieved by scanning several adjacent ground sub-swaths with simultaneous beams, each with a different incidence angle. Due to the reduced azimuth bandwidth, the azimuth resolution of a ScanSAR product is lower than in StripMap mode.\n\n- HS (High-resolution Spotlight Mode). HS provides the highest geometrical resolution. Therefore the size of the observed area on the ground is smaller than the one in all other modes. During the observation of a particular ground scene, the radar beam is steered like a spotlight so that the area of interest is illuminated longer and hence the synthetic aperture becomes larger. The Maximum azimuth steering angle range is ± 0.75º.\n\n- SL (Spotlight Mode). The HS and SL modes are very similar. In SL mode the geometric azimuth resolution is reduced in order to increase the azimuth scene coverage.\n\n• The instrument features selectable or dual polarization (support of single, dual and full polarization modes). Further flexibility is provided by a large number of possible antenna beam configurations. The number of beams in elevation for SM or SC support is about 12. The number of beams in elevation for HS or SL support is about 95.\n\n- Single polarization:\n\nThe radar transmits either H or V-polarized pulses and receives in H or V polarization. The resulting product will consist of one polarimetric channel in one of the combinations of HH, HV, VH or VV. It can be operated in all different modes HS, SL, SM and SC.\n\n- Dual polarization:\n\nIn this mode, the radar toggles the transmit and/or receive polarization on a pulse-to-pulse basis. The effective PRF in each polarimetric channel is half of the total PRF, which means that the azimuth resolution is slightly reduced. The polarimetric phase between both channels can be exploited, e.g. for interferometry or classification purposes. The product consists of two layers that can be selected out of the possible combinations. Dual polarization is possible for all image modes as well.\n\n- Quad polarization:\n\nQuad polarization is possible in the experimental dual receive antenna mode as the signal can be received simultaneously in H and V polarization. By sending alternating H and V pulses, the full polarimetric matrix can be obtained. Currently, quad-polarization is not operationally foreseen (only research support).\n\n• Left or right side observation capability. The slew capability of the TerraSAR-X spacecraft allows observations to be conducted on either side of the sub-satellite track. This feature is of great value for event monitoring - doubling in effect the FOR (Field of Regard).\n\nTSX-SAR Instrument Calibration\n\nThe calibration process transforms the image magnitude or power into the required physical units, which are assumed to be those of radar cross section (RCS) or back-scattering coefficient σo (sigma-zero, radar cross section per unit illuminated area). Three major tasks are being performed by the calibration:\n\n- Internal calibration:\n\nThe compensation of instrument fluctuations. This is performed by in-orbit verification of the instrument against pre-flight results. This internal calibration yields a stabilized radar instrument and defines the radiometric stability.\n\n- Antenna pattern calibration:\n\nThe compensation of the antenna pattern within the SAR scene in order to obtain a constant gain across the whole SAR image. This is performed by a determination/estimation of the actual antenna pattern. We thus obtain relatively calibrated SAR data products and the relative radiometric accuracy.\n\n- External calibration:\n\nThe correction of the radiometric bias. This is performed by measuring the radar system against standard ground targets with known radar cross-section (RCS). This external calibration yields an absolutely calibrated radar system and defines the absolute radiometric accuracy.\n\nThe internal calibration facility of TSX-SAR monitors the critical elements of the XFE (X-band Front-end), consisting of the 384 T/R modules (TRMs) of the active phased array. Each module is feeding a radiating sub-array for horizontal and vertical polarization - controlling the beam steering in azimuth and elevation direction. Three different types of calibration pulses are applied, whereby sets of these pulses are needed at the start and end of each data take. All calibration pulses have the same length and bandwidth (chirp) as is commanded for the mode.\n\nPrecise modelling of the antenna is only possible if the actual characteristics of each individual transmit/receive module (TRM) are known. A calibration network (CAL N/W) records the internal instrument behaviour characterizing the instrument stability over time. The antenna performance can be monitored with an innovative characterization mode based on the so-called PN-gating method.\n\nThe essential TSX-SAR calibration facilities/references are:\n\n• Standard ground target monitoring for the bias correction\n\n• Ground receivers for in-flight measurements\n\n• Different analysis and evaluation tools\n\n- The antenna pattern model provides an estimation of the actual antenna pattern\n\n- SARCON (SAR Product Control Software), for the point target and distributed target analysis of different calibration targets.\n\nIntroduction of new SAR calibration technology:\n\nDue to the multitude of operational modes based on the active phased antenna array with hundreds of T/R modules, a large number of different antenna beams are obtained (some 10,000 for TSX-SAR). For this situation, a conventional calibration approach is not feasible. Hence, DLR/HR developed innovative and efficient calibration methods for the TSX-SAR instrument.\n\nThe two most important innovations are:\n\n- PN-gating (Pseudo Noise-gating), a new method for internal calibration. PN-gating is a technique of monitoring the gain and phase variations in the transmit and receive paths of individual T/R modules while all 384 modules are operating - representing a characterization under the most realistic conditions with the advantage that all modules can be characterized simultaneously. For this purpose, the instrument is operated in a special module characterization mode. The simulated results of the PN-gating method are very promising (confirmed by ground tests).\n\n- A precise antenna model, based on a new antenna pattern optimization. The modular nature of an active phased array antenna provides the capability of mathematical modelling. Such an antenna model is in fact a software tool that accurately determines the antenna beam patterns based on detailed characterization of the antenna hardware and the knowledge of the antenna control parameters. To achieve the required radiometric quality, highly accurate pre-launch characterization data was needed.\n\nAfter pre-launch validation against the near-field pattern measurements and in-flight verification, the antenna model is used to generate the in-orbit calibrated beam patterns required for radiometric corrections in the SAR processing throughout the satellite lifetime. The antenna model is capable of accurately determining not only the individual beam patterns but also the relative gain variations from beam to beam. Determination of the absolute gain from measurements over external calibration targets can then be reduced to a few beams.\n\nIn order to maintain the SAR antenna performance, the following steps are implemented into the TSX-SAR calibration system:\n\n• Compensation of radar instrument drift with the help of internal calibration\n\n• Individual TRM (T/R Module) characterization by using the novel PN-gating method.\n\nThe internal calibration facility features a coupling into an additional port of each TRM. Calibration pulses are routed through the XFE to characterize critical elements of the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) path. The acquired signals can only be measured at the composite ports of the distribution networks. Three different types of calibration pulses are applied, whereby sets of these pulses are needed at the start and end of each data acquisition. All calibration pulses have the same length and bandwidth as the transmit pulse commanded for the mode.\n\nIn orbit, absolute power level degradation is calibrated via external targets like transponders or corner reflectors. Thus, only relative characterization results are of interest.\n\nThe calibration pulses are applied to the XFE to characterize the instrument's influence on the radar signal. The three types of calibration pulses account for the transmit path, the receive path, and for differences in the routing of the first two pulse types. The acquired signals can be measured at the receiving ports of the distribution networks. Evaluating the amplitude and phase of the calibration signals provides information on how to model the instrument drift during data acquisition. This drift is corrected during SAR image processing to obtain high-quality SAR products.\n\nThe spaceborne results from repeated measurements of the same instrument and antenna conditions prove the high measurement accuracy of the PN-gating technique. The repeated measurements were in a time frame of weeks. Still, the accordance of the estimation results to each other is almost perfect.\n\nCalibration results:\n\nDuring the commissioning phase, the baseline calibration procedure approach of TSX was subdivided into six major tasks. The successive baseline calibration procedures were:\n\n• Geometric calibration, to assign the SAR data to the geographic location on the Earth's surface.\n\n• Antenna pointing determination, to obtain a correct beam pointing of the antenna.\n\n• Antenna model verification, to ensure the provision of the antenna patterns of all operation modes and the gain offset between different beams.\n\n• Relative radiometric calibration, for radiometric correction of SAR data within an illuminated scene.\n\n• Absolute radiometric calibration, for measuring the SAR system against standard targets with well-known radar cross section (RCS).\n\nThe results of calibrating TerraSAR-X approve the accuracy calculated before launch and put the new strategy to calibrate efficiently a multiple mode SAR system like TerraSAR-X on a solid base. The key element of this strategy was an antenna model approach. TerraSAR-X is the first SAR satellite calibrated with this innovative method.\n\nAll requirements and/or goals have been achieved even better than predicted. Through this successful demonstration of an effective and exact calibration technique, a new benchmark has been reached not only for calibrating complex SAR systems but in principle for future highly accurate spaceborne SAR sensors like TanDEM-X or Sentinel-1 (Ref. 117).\n\nSAR Interferometry\n\nTerraSAR-X offers a number of new perspectives to SAR interferometry when compared to ERS and also to Envisat:\n\n• High resolution of 3 m or better in stripmap and spotlight mode\n\n• The option for a burst synchronized scanSAR mode\n\n• The high range bandwidth will allow large baselines and the option for highly precise DEM generation\n\n• X-band will show new scattering properties\n\n• High observation frequency due to the short repeat cycle and variable incidence\n\n• An ATI (Along Track Interferometric) mode.\n\nThe rather short orbit repeat cycle of 11 days and the electronically steerable antenna allows fast and frequent imaging of a certain site. At average latitudes, an interferometric pair can be acquired within only 12 days. And within 22 days 12 interferometric pairs with different observation geometries can theoretically be acquired. Note that the nominal antenna look direction is to the right. The left-looking mode is possible but has some operational deficiencies so it will only be used in high-priority situations.\n\nSecondary Payloads\n\nTOR (Tracking, Occultation and Ranging)\n\nThe TOR experiment is furnished by GFZ Potsdam, Germany. and CSR (Center of Space Research) at UTA (the University of Texas at Austin), USA. The TOR payload consists of the dual-frequency GPS receiver IGOR (Integrated GPS Occultation Receiver), developed and built by Broad Reach Engineering Company of Tempe, AZ, and LRR (Laser Retro Reflector) for evaluation of GPS-based orbit data as an independent tracking technique. The IGOR design is of BlackJack heritage of NASA/JPL, flown on such missions as CHAMP, SAC-C, Jason-1, and GRACE.\n\n- The overall objectives are\n\n1) To collect atmospheric and ionospheric radio occultation (RO) data using IGOR and to augment the global RO data sets obtained from other LEO satellites (namely CHAMP and GRACE) to be used for improvements of numerical weather forecasts, climate change studies and space weather monitoring. Derived fundamental atmospheric and ionospheric quantities (e.g. temperature, water vapour) are being used as complementary information for SAR data error correction.\n\n2) Use of the resulting high-quality orbit and atmospheric correction products in conjunction with DLR-provided TSX-SAR data for improved analysis.\n\nSpecific objectives for the TSX-SAR science studies are:\n\n- Landslide, rock fall and urban land subsidence\n\n- Ice sheet applications\n\n- TSX-SAR digital terrain model for surface water availability modelling\n\n- Seismic loading cycle studies\n\n3) The IGOR GPS tracking capabilities are being used for ground-based POD (Precise Orbit Determination) algorithm processing with accuracies of < 5 cm in position (IGOR is a 48-channel space-qualified GPS receiver). The orbits can be made available within less than 3 hours after data reception and are being used for SAR science analysis and eventually for NWP analysis.\n\nThe IGOR payload suite consists of a dual-redundant dual-frequency (L1/L2) GPS receiver unit, a built-in SSR(Solid-State Recorder), a built-in PC, and an antenna set comprised of:\n\n• Two POD (Precision Orbit Determination) L1/L2 patch antennas\n\n• Two RO (Radio Occultation) antennas 1x4 L1/L2 patch arrays\n\nThe IGOR instrument [GPS, SSR, antennas, PC] consists of a box of size 200 mm x 240 mm x 100 mm with a mass of about 4.2 kg.\n\nThe main components of the infrastructure for TerraSAR-X GPS occultations are the GPS receiver onboard the satellite and the ground segment. It consists of the Polar receiving station at Ny-Ålesund (Spitzbergen), the fiducial GPS ground network, the ultra-rapid precise orbit determination facility, the operational occultation processing system and, for archiving and distribution: the TerraSAR-X data Center.\n\nThe generation of the TerraSAR-X GPS occultation data products will be performed by an automatic data processing system, which will be based on the CHAMP/GRACE processing system. This system is designed to be extendable for the processing of additional GPS occultation missions, as of TerraSAR-X.\n\nTable 8: Data products of the TOR experiment\n\nTwo independent GPS receiver units are used on TerraSAR-X for increased redundancy. For each receiver, an independent passive GPS antenna (Seavey SPA-16C/S) and low noise amplifier (Delta Microwave L5690) are employed, which enable representative signal-to-noise ratios (C/N0) of 45 dB-Hz near the boresight direction. To provide adequate sky coverage during right- and left-looking SAR operations, the MosaicGNSS GPS antennas are oriented opposite to the SAR antenna. In the nominal flight configuration (right-looking SAR), the boresight points to the left of the flight direction with a 33.8º offset from the vertical. The IGOR choke ring antennas, in contrast, are exactly zenith pointing (Ref. 17).\n\nLRR (Laser Retro Reflector)\n\nLRR is of CHAMP and GRACE heritage developed at GFZ. A passive optical device for accurate satellite tracking from ground laser ranging stations of the SLR network. SLR tracking to spaceborne laser retro-reflectors is performed by a global network of about 40 ground stations of the ILRS (International Laser Ranging Service). The SLR data provide an independent observation type at a comparable accuracy level to the onboard GPS tracking data for the quality assurance of the TerraSAR-X POD (Precise Orbit Determination).\n\nLCT (Laser Communication Terminal)\n\nTSX-LCT is an experimental secondary payload, developed and built by Tesat-Spacecom GmbH of Backnang as the prime contractor (formerly Bosch SatCom GmbH; Tesat Spacecom is owned by EADS Astrium), Germany. LCT development contributions come also from EADS Astrium and Zeiss Optronik. LCT funding comes from DLR and from BMBF. The LCT (optical communication) technology and implementation were chosen due to its potential of providing higher data rates, lower mass and lower power than required by conventional RF communications.\n\nThe LCT objective is to provide either a bidirectional communications link for binary digital data transfer between two satellites, (like LEO-MEO) or between one satellite and an optical ground station.\n\nLCT on TerraSAR-X, also referred to as LCTSX, is designed as a COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) product and is already being made available to other missions. Tesat-Spacecom provides the full ground test equipment especially the so-called STB (System Test Bed) to verify the complete sequence of LCT operational states from start-up over acquisition and tracking to communication under space environment, i.e. link distance, satellite's in-orbit vibrations, sun light.\n\n- The intent is to use LCT on future high data rate missions, in Earth observation as well as in commercial communications.\n\nBackground: The on-orbit verification of the first coherent optical communication system on a satellite builds on more than 15 years of European efforts under programs and studies like SOLACOS (Solid State Laser Communications in Space), DLR-LCT, MEDIS (Multimedia Experiment and Demonstration System), and SILEX (Semiconductor Intersatellite Link Experiment). SILEX, an ESA design, was the only project that was realized, with an LEO terminal on SPOT-4 (launch March 24, 1998) and a GEO terminal on ARTEMIS (launch July 12, 2001).\n\nIn 1998, Tesat-Spacecom was selected for the Celestri and Teledesic programs by Motorola to build all laser crosslinks for a LEO constellation (in the meantime Teledesic program was cancelled). The laser oscillators, qualified for Teledesic, are now foreseen for many scientific missions like DWL, GIFTS and ALADIN.\n\nNote: LCT is considered the first laser communication system in space that operates on a coherent basis (homodyne digital receiver and BPSK modulation). In a coherent system, the receiver operates by optically adding a locally generated field to the receiver field prior to photodetection. The prime objective is to use the added local field to improve the detection of the weaker received field in the presence of the receiver thermal noise. - In contrast, the SILEX concept employs a direct-detection system in which the desired information is intensity modulated onto an optical source and transmitted to the receiver terminal. In this concept, the photodetector at the receiver side provides basically the function of a power detection device. - While coherent detection is the most advanced technology, which enables the maximum data rate at minimum power, it requires relatively complicated hardware and it cannot be used through atmospheric turbulence.\n\nHomodyne BPSK optical modulation scheme (Ref. 72)\n\nHomodyne BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) is superior to all other optical modulation schemes since it is the most sensitive for both, tracking and communication. More important, however, is its immunity against sunlight. Homodyne BPSK allows to the maintenance of the communication link, and as a precondition also tracking, even if the sun is in the receiver's field of view.\n\nHomodyne BPSK is based on phase modulation and coherent detection. The signal to be detected is superposed to the beam of a local oscillator laser running on the same frequency as the signal's carrier. With the optical phases of both, the signal carrier and local oscillator, being locked to each other one have a sensitive detection and demodulation scheme for the phase signal.\n\nThe same LCT system of Tesat-Spacecom is also flown on the NFIRE (Near Field Infrared Experiment) spacecraft of the US MDA (Missile Defense Agency) of DoD with a launch on April 24, 2007, from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, VA (Minotaur vehicle of OSC). The NFIRE spacecraft has been built by General Dynamics C4 Systems of Gilbert, Arizona (formerly SpectrumAstro). LCT is installed on NFIRE as a secondary payload to evaluate laser communication technology. The primary mission of the NFIRE satellite is to collect images of a boosting rocket to improve understanding of exhaust plume phenomenology and plume-to-rocket body discrimination. In addition, forest fires, volcanoes and ground-based rocket engine tests are on NFIRE's observation list for the two-year mission as well.\n\nIn a further verification step, an ISL (InterSatellite Link) between LCT on TerraSAR-X and LCT on the NFIRE satellite is planned to be established.\n\nTable 9: Performance overview of LCT (Laser Communication Terminal)\n\nInstrument: LCT is accommodated on the anti-sun side of TerraSAR-X to guarantee a free hemispherical FOV which includes the Earth's surface. The terminal consists of one physical unit with a mass of about 33 kg and an average power consumption of 136 W. For thermal control reasons, LCT is equipped with a heat pipe radiator having a radiator area of 0.57 m2 and a mass of about 10 kg. Due to the generous energy margin of the spacecraft, LCT can be operated in parallel with the TSX-SAR instrument for most of the year.\n\nThe instrument is functionally divided into Optics Unit (OU) which includes the coarse pointing mechanism, telescope, fine pointer and receiver and a Frame Unit. The OU consists of the beam-handling elements of the terminal. The CPU (Coarse Pointing Unit) is designed as a stiff lightweight construction to guide incoming and outgoing laser beams from/to its free aperture to the telescope (124 mm aperture diameter). The aperture of the CPU is steered by two independent motors with full pointing, tracking and communications performance over the entire hemisphere. Within the CPU, the beam is guided by two high-precision mirrors keeping track of the optical path onto the line-of-sight to the counter terminal. The leaving and received beams have a common path through the telescope (athermal, lightweight) for magnification/demagnification and through the Fine Pointing Unit (FPU).\n\nThe FPU employs a high-bandwidth pointing mechanism which provides the necessary tracking gain at frequencies up to 1 kHz in order to cancel satellite vibrations. The receiving beam is then separated from the leaving beam path by a polarization beam splitter and sent to the receiver. The receiver contains the 90º hybrid replacing the optical bench. There the received beam is superposed with a local oscillator laser in order to extract maximum sensitivity for a given received power level. The 90º hybrid has the added functionality of generating four separate beams with 0º, 90º, 180º and 270º relative phase shifts. The acquisition, tracking and communications information contained within the four outputs of the 90º hybrid is detected in the photodiode arrays of the electrical front end, where they are immediately preprocessed. Further processing of this information (phase locking, data extraction, tracking servo) is performed by the electronics located in the Frame Unit.\n\nThe Frame Unit contains the EPC (Electrical Power Conditioner) for the terminal, the Terminal and PAT (Pointing, Acquisition and Tracking) Controller (TAPCO), data electronics and the Laser Subsystem. The Laser Subsystem contains two highly reliable diode pump modules for pumping two solid-state lasers in NPRO [(Non-Planar Ring Oscillator) after Kane, Byer] configuration. One laser serves as transmit laser. The second laser serves as a local oscillator and is fed directly to the receiver optical bench. The laser pump modules were developed to a large extent by researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology (ILT) in Aachen, Germany, on behalf of Tesat.\n\nThe LCT equipment employs a high-performance PowerPC processor (505 MIPS) which allows running both tasks, real-time control loops and TM/TC data processing, at the same time on a single computer. It exhibits small dimensions (180 mm x 160 mm x 60 mm) and low mass (1 kg). The power consumption is in the range of 15 W, depending on the processor load. The onboard computer provides a variety of hardware interfaces, especially high-resolution A/D and D/A interfaces as well as a MIL-STD-1553B interface. Due to its modular software architecture, the functionality can be easily adapted to application-specific requirements.\n\nGround Segment\n\nThe TerraSAR-X ground segment is composed of the following elements:\n\n• DLR/GSOC is providing the functions of spacecraft operations (commanding, monitoring, planning & scheduling, orbit and attitude determination, etc.) and data acquisition with ground stations in Weilheim and Neustrelitz. Weilheim is used as TT&C station, while Neustrelitz serves as the central receiving station of payload data at 300 Mbit/s.\n\n• DLR/HR (DLR/Institut für Hochfrequenztechnik und Radar) is providing the IOCS (Instrument Operation and Calibration Segment) function\n\n• PGS (Payload Ground Segment) function. The DLR research functions of data processing, analysis and simulation are provided by DFD (Deutsches Fernerkundungsdatenzentrum) and IMF (Institut für Methodik der Fernerkundung). The DLR Ground Segment provides the main functions Space and Ground Segment planning, orbit control and analysis, spacecraft telemetry reception and command, data reception and archiving, calibration and performance analysis, product generation, delivery and provision of user services.\n\n• To comply with increased requirements on data latency, especially from the Maritime and Emergency Response Services, the TerraSAR’s ground station network access has constantly been upgraded especially through additional polar station access.\n\nAirbus Defence and Space (formerly EADS Astrium/Infoterra) is providing the service infrastructure for commercial data exploitation and customer interfaces. Additional direct payload access stations - commercial partners of Infoterra - are foreseen to extend the baseline receiving station concept.\n\nReferences\n\nA. Roth, R.
