        "text": "I am extremely impressed with the IXEG 737.\n\nFuture is going to be very interesting indeed..\n\nIf Xplane take this oppurtunity to really develop the visuals, and user interface, it has all the hallmarkings to take over the P3d dominance and we can finally forget talking about licences\n\nPMDG JS41\n\nPMDG MD11\n\nPMDG B744\n\nLeonardo MD80\n\nFeelthere E135 / Feelthere E145\n\nWilco E170 / Wilco E190\n\nQualitywings RJ1H\n\nAlready in the FSX hangar and running fine\n\nA2A P28A\n\nA2A C182\n\nA2A PA24\n\nRealair LEG2\n\nRealair BE60\n\nRazbam SW4\n\nMajestic DH8D\n\nPMDG B737NG\n\nPMDG B777\n\nAerosoft A320\n\nAlready in the FSX-SE / P3D hanger and operating well\n\nMajestic DH8C\n\niTG B717\n\nFSlabs A320\n\nAerosoft A330\n\nQualitywings B787\n\nPMDG B744v2\n\nAwaiting release.\n\nXplane has a fair way to go. Especially in the \"Fully functioning FMS/autoflight\" department.\n\nI'd list aircraft that fit that bill as:\n\nIXEG B733\n\nSpecifically I'd put the Rotatesim MD80 in a \"Still has plenty of room for improvement\" category still well short of the 2008 Leonardo Maddog MD80.\n\nAnd from \"Best to worst\",\n\nIXEG B733\n\nRotatesim MD80\n\nEverything else Xplane has to offer.\n\nIt's good Xplane finally has 1 plane in the \"Good enough to list here\" category. all my opinion of course!\n\n(disclaimer: PMDG B744x, Level-D B763 and Aerosoft A320 are in my \"Almost aren't good enough to list here\" category, along with the RotateSim MD80)\n\nThe Wilco/Feelthere products have missing details, but I find the experience of flying them close to on par with Aerosoft's A320, so if Aerosoft gets a mention, so should they.\n\nRealityXP GNS430/GNS540 and Flight1 GTN650 push the GA products well into the \"very interesting indeed\" category.\n\nRotatesim MD80\n\nIf you're going to mention the rotate MD-80 then you would have to mention the Flight Factor 767-300. It's pretty close to the same class as the IXEG 737. Every sim has its' strengths and weaknesses. I've never quite understood the mindset that it had to be one or the other.\n\nXplane has a fair way to go. Especially in the \"Fully functioning FMS/autoflight\" department.\n\nI'd list aircraft that fit that bill as:\n\nIXEG B733\n\nSpecifically I'd put the Rotatesim MD80 in a \"Still has plenty of room for improvement\" category still well short of the 2008 Leonardo Maddog MD80.\n\nYou should do a bit more research as ALL of the Flight Factor aircraft have a more functional autoflight and FMC than the IXEG and most assuredly the MD-80. As someone who owns basically all the high end XP addons I can assure you the IXEG has only something approaching a \"Fully functioning FMS/autoflight\" but it's missing several key features. Maybe in a month or 2 will it be feature complete.\n\nBefore I used to compare to PMDG, Level-D Simulations etc and ask, is \"insert any product for comparison\" better than the PMDG?\n\nNow I've learnt that is not the correct approach. The question to ask is, citing Jeremy Clarkson, \"Is it any good?\"\n\nThe IXEG 737 is a great airplane on its own right, in absolute terms. Sure there's things that need polishing here and there, but the truth is that as of now it's a solid product. As are many other products developed for X-Plane 10.\n\nI don't think that immediately rejecting anything because \"it's far from PMDG level\" is a healthy idea for this hobby. We need an open mind people! Otherwise developers won't bother.\n\nWell,actually Tony, I do have P3D and FSX, but when you see what X-Plane has to offer - what's an OOM again? Sure, there are learning curves, like any application.\n\nI have Xplane as well as P3D. I've had more Xplane CTD's than P3D OOM's (I've only ever OOM'd once with P3D V3). As far as I can see all Xplane has to offer is a 64 bit platform but for me P3D looks way better with the likes of Orbx etc installed. And now IXEG have released their 737, which isn't really a finished product, apart from PMDG's DC6 what else high fidelity is on the horizon? Time and time again people talk about Xplane being the future but after three years I just don't see that."
