A second parent reported her children had witnessed the event as well. The bus driver was contacted and they indicated the man had not been seen on the bus before and that they would keep an eye out for him during the next day. At 8 a.m. today, Elk Valley RCMP received a phone call from the BC Transit bus driver, stating the man was on the bus again and was travelling toward the Sparwood hospital. The information received was that the man had actually grabbed the arm of a five-year-old girl the previous day, so police formed grounds to believe an offence had taken place. Police proceeded to the bus stop, where the transit bus was met and the driver identified the man involved. RCMP officers entered the bus, located the man and arrested him for assault. The man complied with police direction, was safely handcuffed and led outside where the arrest procedure was completed. Other than his phone, no other items were located on his person, reported S/Sgt. Svend Nielsen, Elk Valley RCMP Detachment commander. “As an aside, Elk Valley RCMP wish to set the record straight after noting the release of misinformation on social media that multiple weapons were found on the arrested suspect. No weapons were located and/or used during the alleged commission of this offence(s). Elk Valley RCMP caution anyone from manufacturing false information on an active police investigation, which may hinder the fact-finding efforts being completed by the investigators,” S/Sgt. Nielsen said. The suspect was brought to RCMP cells in Sparwood and provided access to legal counsel.

Bush, in an interview with BBC 6 Music, was unequivocal that she would not be playing live, saying,”I haven’t got any plans to do any live shows whatsoever. I’m very much engrossed in trying to making new material.” She recently released her latest album, The Director’s Cut, a collection of re-recorded songs from her 1989 album The Sensual World and her 1993 album The Red Shoes. “I’m extremely flattered that people are interested,” she added. A notorious recluse, Bush toured for the one and only time in 1979. She said of that time, “People always presume I didn’t enjoy that tour. I did enjoy it.” She had hinted at a possible live return by saying that she wanted to experience the thrill of performing again before she became too old to do so, but it seems any chance of that happening in the coming years has been quashed. Fans can console themselves with the fact she has done most of the writing for a new album – this time one of new material.

From that year back in 1973 all the way until 2000, I was at camp for the entire eight weeks.\" \"We got involved because of tradition,\" Goldstein says. \"I don't think it was ever questioned that we would go to camp; it was just what we did. We signed up and went.\" The family agrees that staff and friends are what make Laurelwood special. \"Many of us have lifelong friends that were made at camp,\" Lori says. \"Hillary has a group of girls that have been together since the day they started at camp. They have had the same counselors for much of that time. There are not many staff members that, as parents, we would all trust to take a group of 30 teenagers to Costa Rica for three weeks, but after the years together, these staff members have become family to everyone. My daughters even refer to one as their 'summer mom.'\" \"It's a great all-around camp and there's a comfort level being with other Jewish kids,\" Friedman says. \"My daughters describe the experience as, 'It feels like you're with family as soon as you walk through the entrance.' From my experience and David's, we knew we would have lifelong friendships and we do still maintain them. We knew that would continue for our kids because the bonds that we form there aren't like any other connections.\" \"As an adult, I stayed involved with camp because it is a truly special place where I made great friends and where we had great experiences,\" Dan Papermaster says. \"I realized that there are a lot of great and unique things about camp; two things stand out: As the only Jewish overnight camp in Connecticut, it is a true statewide community asset. And, it is a not-for-profit camp that allows any Jewish kid to attend, regardless of means. This is a true strength of the camp, as kids from varied backgrounds come together to experience camp and no one knows who is there on scholarship and who is not. There are so many success stories of scholarship kids finding a 'home' at Laurelwood, achieving success in later life, and looking back on their time at Laurelwood as having made a real difference in their lives.\" Dan Papermaster and his wife Beth considered other overnight camps for their own kids, Nathan and Molly, \"but the family history of a connection to Laurelwood was a priority,\" Beth explains. \"Laurelwood isn't far from home [in West Hartford] and most of their friends would be in Connecticut, so going to bar- and bat-mitzvahs and visiting would be easier than if their friends were spread out and farther away.\" Nathan Papermaster, now 20 and a junior at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, was a camper for three summers and then a counselor for the next three summers. \"I had enjoyed my previous summers at day camps and was really excited to enjoy an overnight experience,\" he says. \"I was really interested in going to Laurelwood because I wanted similar experiences as my father, who attended the camp as a camper and spent many summers working there as well. He always had great stories and I could tell I would love the camp the second I first visited the camp.\" Molly Papermaster, an 18-year-old freshman at Boston University, spent three summers as a camper before working as a junior counselor and, this year, head counselor. \"I went to Laurelwood because my parents 'forced me to go' and I loved it and then I just had to keep going back,\" she says. \"I wanted to be a counselor because I loved my counselors and loved camp and I wanted to give other kids the same great experience I had.\" \"I would say the lasting friendships were a primary reason I continued to attend camp,\" Nathan Papermaster says. \"The friendships and dynamic experiences that helped me grow were not only fun but also changed and grew up with me. The level of dedication of the staff is incredible. The range of interests and backgrounds of the campers and staff is diverse but everyone is equal at camp. It really is a bubble of fun where all that matters are the shared experiences of that summer.\" \"I found that the staff created an experience that was unique,\" says Molly Papermaster. \"Because they loved their jobs, they made me love my experience. What I think is extra-special about Laurelwood is the people – it is not a glitzy camp but the people are so special. I built amazing relationships with people from camp, lifelong relationships with both other campers as well as staff.\" \"What's nice about Laurelwood is that the activities are so basic and no-frills,\" says Leslie Kramer. \"It's not about the physical beauty of the camp, which really doesn't matter – it's about the activities the kids participate in and the bonds they form. There are rowboats and canoes; it's not about the stuff and the technology. The kids put their phones away and do basic activities that they can really enjoy and tune into.\" The religious and cultural aspects of camp also make lasting impressions. \"Although I did grow up in a Jewish household and attended religious school, I would say that most of what I learned about keeping kosher, enjoying Shabbat services, etc. comes from camp,\" says Lori Goldstein. \"My daughters and friends all look forward to Shabbat and Havdalah services at camp and carry on these songs and traditions together at bar- and bat-mitzvahs, BBYO events, etc. Without camp, I'm not sure that they would have ever experienced a Havdalah service.\" Molly Papermaster echoes the sentiment. \"I loved Shabbat on Friday nights, seeing everyone in white, coming together,\" she says. \"It was very positive and upbeat.\" Dan Papermaster points to Laurelwood's robust 75-year history as ample proof that the camp is a pillar of the statewide Jewish community. \"Laurelwood is a place where young Jewish kids can develop a positive Jewish identity and find relationships to last a lifetime,\" he says. \"It serves as a place that connects kids and families from across Connecticut. This helps attract young families to our communities because we have places like Laurelwood and strong JCCs.\"\n\nen\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before, an Aisling is not just the Irish word for ‘dream’, but also a definitive approach to poetry in Ireland, that first surfaced in the late 17th century. For the history of how it came to be, and how it flourished within Irish culture over the years you can find its story in this month’s gazette, where we examine the conflict, redemption and determination that so define this particular branch of poetry. For now, we are simply going to appreciate how the Aisling has acted as a mouthpiece for Ireland’s writers over the years; as each sculpted their words to fit her form – pouring their own dreams into the traditional structure, to create a new vision for the future. We’ll start with one of the most well-known poems from 18th century Ireland, and a renowned example of Aisling poetry from the original master of the form – Aodhgan O'Rathaille. Our eyes are said to be the window into our souls, making the description of a sparkle of blue amongst green a very fitting for the Aisling’s – as a metaphor for the land and sea of the emerald isle herself. As well as revering the work of the Aislingí before him, Seamus Heaney was also known to dabble with the form himself – each time moulding the traditional Irish style into a new form to carry his creative vision. His poem, simply entitled ‘Aisling’ is a brief yet powerful warning against unwelcome prying into Ireland’s matters; while the inspiration of form dates back to the 17th century, his content stretches even further into antiquity – as he calls upon the stories of the Greek gods. The stag’s exhausted belling?\" The mortal hunter Actaeon was said to have peered at Artemis (or Diana) while bathing, and in her fury at his disrespect, the mighty goddess turned her unwelcome spectator into a stag. Her spell transformed the hunter into the hunted, resulting in his eventual demise at the jaws of his own dogs. I think the message here is clear… despite her beautiful and gentle nature – Ireland is not to be messed with. This state of solitude is often the moment in which the Aisling reveals herself to the narrator, in this instance it appears almost as though he was guided to their meeting by enchantments – bringing a layer of mythology to the piece. I always find this loneliness at the beginning so striking; it gives the poet a chance to reflect on the beauty that surrounds him, and contemplate his inner mind. Dreams don’t come to us when we are surrounded by people, but instead we are most susceptible to Aislingí when we are alone with our thoughts. The loneliness ceases to have sad connotations, as it manifests as an opportunity for an extraordinarily spiritual experience. Undercurrents of Irish mythology and the presence of the Tuatha de Danán was a pretty regular occurrence in the original Aislingí, so much so that Brian Merriman has absolutely no trouble twisting it to suit his own comic needs within his satirical “Cúirt An Mheán Oíche” or “Midnight Court”. The poem jests at the expense of Ireland, poetic form, and current affairs – but even the most obvious satire can’t completely dissolve the wonderful imagery in which it resides – “My heart would brighten Loch Graney to spy,/And the country around it, to the edge of the sky./The serried mountains were a delight to the beholder/ Thrusting their heads over each other’s shoulder. Of course, we wouldn’t get very far in a collection of poems without mentioning the great William Butler Yeats. You might already have come across “The Song of the Wandering Aengus”, but did you know that it too draws its inspiration from Aisling poetry? In this recounting of an adventure in an old man’s past, the aisling is but a brief glimpse – before disappearing before the poets eyes, yet he holds on to the thought of her, pursuing he through the rest of his life. This perhaps is semi-autobiographical in Yeats’ well documented unrequited love for Maude Gonne – an Irish nationalist who he held up on a pedestal above all other women. This notion of the aisling representing Maud Gonne is reversed in his play Cathleen ni Houlihan – his one act play which was based the poetic form, in which Maud Gonne physically played the role of the Aisling. The poem itself is an exquisite exploration of the beauties of nature, with Yeats’ words pouring the promise of folklore into every crack of Ireland’s breath-taking scenery, a task which is crowned by the inclusion of Aengus – a character of Irish mythology – within his title. Which of the above examples of Aisling poetry resonates with you the most? Why not delve deeper into this dreamy pool of verse for yourself, and see if you can uncover more visions of Ireland concealed within the stanzas of our writers?\n\nen\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nin both the public and private sector; 9.

It’s easy to let disagreements become fights or tear relationships apart. Disagreements can lead to social media rants or angry actions. This is where it becomes wrong. Disagreements can be handled respectfully and politely without anger or judgement. Sometimes you agree to disagree or even agree that a relationship shouldn’t progress but it should be done gently and lovingly. It is vital that a dad shows his son the importance of work – both in a vocation and in not being lazy in everyday life. Sometimes dads don’t have a vocation and they can still instill a wonderful work ethic in their sons. While they teach the importance of work, though, they also need to be teaching the importance of play. There is a time for both and going to crazy on either sides is wrong.

Lleva el apodo de La Bomba, debido a su fuerte tiro para realizar los tiros libres y a la vez, en alusión al baloncestista español Juan Carlos Navarro, quien también es apodado de esa manera. Su debut profesional en San Lorenzo lo hizo el 12 de noviembre de 2011 cuando ingresó por Sebastián González, en una derrota 0-1 frente al Club Atlético All Boys. En esa temporada disputaría un solo partido más por lo que solo jugó dos encuentros de los 38 respectivos. En la temporada 2012/2013, disputaría 10 partidos en los cuales marcaría dos goles, el primero sería frente a Velez Sarsfield desde casi más de 40 metros el 6 de abril de 2013, ante una mala salida de Sebastian Sosa y el segundo lo convertiría enfrentando a Arsenal de Sarandí 15 días más tarde, el 21 de abril de 2013, que se metió en el ángulo izquierdo de Cristian Campestrini. Ambos goles fueron mediante pelota parada. El 26 de julio del 2014, durante los entrenamientos de pre-temporada sufrió una grave lesión, por esto fue operado. La recuperación de la lesión requirió de 6 meses por lo que no pudo disputar ningún partido en lo que quedaba del 2014. El 13 de agosto del 2014, San Lorenzo de Almagro disputó la vuelta de la final de la copa Copa Libertadores 2014 contra Club Nacional (Paraguay) y tras ganar San Lorenzo 1 - Nacional 0 se consagró nuevamente campeón. A lo largo de este campeonato, y antes de su lesión, disputó cuatro partidos; en todos los casos ingresó desde el banco de los suplentes. El 17 de julio de 2015, tras no tener lugar en el equipo de Edgardo Bauza, se oficializa el préstamo por seis meses a la entidad de La Paternal. Su debut fue el 23 de julio por la Copa Argentina, en la derrota 1-0 frente a Guaraní Antonio Franco.

This week held on Moorhen and Heron pools This venue normally fishes well in the winter and there are always plenty of fish to be caught after a good breakfast from the fishery cafe.Rob, Stu, Robin, Doug and Mark drew on Moorhen while Phil and Andy drew Heron. Being on different pools wasn’t a problem as the battle for the pounds was very close with several 70lb+ weights recorded by the Nomads in a total weight of 468lb.Rob continued his good form from winning a 100 pegger at Woodland View the previous week, this time taking all the Nomads pounds (again) but also picked up in the mainframe winning his open section win with 75lb Well done RobAll the Nomads caught well during the match with both Andy Mitchell (72lb) and Phil Seedhouse (71lb) just missing out on their sections, both being 2nd in section.Other Nomads Stu Thomson, Robin Ballard, Doug Smith and Mark Birbeck still caught well and that’s why we fish these types of venue. The Overall match was won with 96lb so we weren’t far of the pace against the venue experts. We will be back. gene. a one-time get rid of for CF lung disease from the causative mutation regardless. Within this review, we explore main challenges and latest improvement toward this ambitious objective. The ideal healing cell would: (1) end up being autologous in order to avoid the problems of rejection and immune-suppression; (2) end up being safely modified expressing useful CFTR; (3) end up being expandable to create sufficient cell amounts to revive CFTR function; and (4) possess the capability to engraft, proliferate and persist long-term in receiver airways without problems. Herein, we BMY 7378 explore individual bronchial epithelial cells (HBEcandidate cell therapies for CF and explore the issues facing their delivery towards the individual airway. gene leading to deficient and/or faulty CFTR protein (Reducing, 2014; Ratjen et al., 2015). CFTR can be an anion route present across a genuine variety of epithelia like the lungs, intestine, sinuses, pancreas, biliary tree, and vas deferens. The results of CFTR dysfunction are pronounced in the lungs where inadequate chloride and bicarbonate ion transportation results within BMY 7378 an abnormally viscous and acidic apical surface area level (ASL). This unusual environment is certainly colonized by bacterias in early lifestyle and a routine of infections and inflammation leads to bronchiectasis and end-stage lung disease (Ratjen et al., 2015). Disease intensity is set to a big extent with the causative mutation(s). More than 2,000 variations in have already been described, which around 300 have already been determined to become pathogenic (cftr2.org). These variants or combinations of variants possess differing results in the function and amount of CFTR protein. Some variations are connected with milder disease or particular organ participation while others might be connected with extremely serious disease. For classification reasons, these mutations are grouped into six classes (I-VI) predicated on their influence on CFTR including: no protein synthesis (course I), protein misfolding (course II), dysfunctional route gating (course III), decreased conductance (course IV), insufficient CFTR protein because of unusual RNA splicing (course V), BMY 7378 or elevated protein turnover (course VI). Mucus clearance methods, antibiotics, and BMY 7378 lung transplantation enhance the life span of CF individuals significantly. The recent breakthrough of CFTR modulators provides ushered in a fresh era of accuracy medication for CF sufferers with mutations that bring about some residual druggable CFTR protein. For instance, the main defect in sufferers with the course III mutation G551D is certainly diminished route activity on the apical surface area. Ivacaftor can be an FDA accepted CFTR potentiator that boosts CFTR activity and leads to scientific improvement in sufferers with at least one duplicate from the G551D CFD1 mutation (Ramsey et al., 2011). F508dun is the many common CFTR mutation impacting around 90% of CF sufferers (Reducing, 2014). This mutation leads to defective trafficking and folding from the CFTR protein. Corrector molecules such as for example lumacaftor and tezacaftor together with ivacaftor bring about elevated CFTR activity plus some scientific improvement though much less solid as the response of gating and residual function mutations to ivacaftor therapy (Rowe et al., 2017; Taylor-Cousar et al., 2018). Latest improvement with triple mixture regimens including two correctors in addition to the potentiator ivacaftor signifies increased efficacy for all those harboring the course II F508dun mutation (Davies et al., 2018; Keating et al., 2018). Course I mutations are BMY 7378 nonsense, splice or frame-shift variations that bring about premature termination from the CFTR transcript no CFTR protein. These patients now have no targeted remedies available and there are various obstacles to a pharmacological method of treatment. The task is clear, just how do we recognize and develop effective therapies for everyone CF individuals? Theoretically, changing the mutant series with the standard series could restore CFTR function irrespective of mutation. Generally, this may be performed by among three strategies: (1) delivery of regular series, e.g., via viral vectors, (2) editing and enhancing from the mutant series or, (3) delivery of cells having the normal series to displace cells having the mutant series.

Google uses over 200 factors to rank a website, but one of the key influencing factors in backlinks When Google see, it counts as a ‘vote’. In this FREE online course, I explain the basics and provide some tips on what you can do to increase your domain authority (DA) of your website. Don’t know what domain authority is? Then you definitely need this course! In this video, I talk about backlinks so we can understand what is a link and why we need them. So a ‘link’ is short for a hyperlink. As an example, anywhere that there is some text that says something like ‘check out my website‘ and that Web site is a clickable link or a clickable word that when you click it it takes you to to the intended page. The other Web site sees in this example that that is a link. Not all links are created equal but we will cover the different types of links and the different types of the link profile and the value of each one of them in the next several videos. So the thing about a link is it’s how people navigate the Internet. It’s how people get from point A to Point B. Not only are links part of going from other websites there’s also going to different pages so you can have on the home page of your website links that says ‘contact‘ and you click it and goes to your contact and you didn’t leave your website, so that is still considered a link. So you have internal links, external links and you’re basically going from one page to another. Also, search engines use links to navigate or to. So when a search engine is looking through their website everything’s automated it’s not a person behind the search engine. And what they do is they look at websites, look at every single page on the Internet and they look at the links. So that’s how they get from one page to the next to the next. So if you have a page on your Web site it doesn’t have a link to it anywhere. Then Google or any other search engine will not be able to find it.

My own humble entry, “The Great California Grow Rush,” placed fourth in the “Which story was the sexiest?” category. Folks also appreciated the bit of humor which was very gratifying. I worried that the joke might fall flat and I would be a stand-up comic “bombing” in front of a silently disapproving audience with sweat beading on my forehead while I pause to audibly gulp in awkward fashion. So, I was happy that my jocular addition was not without merit. Typically, for these quarterly contests, my entries are posted to the blog once final results are announced. However, our family dog recently hurt himself and we were in a minor panic trying to get him seen by a local veterinarian. It was late in the evening and our veterinarian’s after-hours phone number was frustratingly useless. Eventually, we were able to make an appointment and he was treated. It was determined that he suffered some form of minor spinal injury. Suffice to say, the last few days have not been great, but at least he appears to be getting better. BLOSSOMING BOSOMS AND LENGTHENING LEGS belonging to lovely ladies changed history forever. The promise of enhancing one’s physical attributes drew attention from across the world. Simple minds considered only the carnal pleasures to be found with such transformations. Those with more imagination saw that transformations also foreshadowed a shift in society. After all, if the fairer sex could achieve physical endurance and strength far beyond men, then traditional justifications for restricting women’s rights might prove hollow. The argument that women were weak and needed to be protected could no longer be used to justify their lack of suffrage. The newly discovered Grow Gold altered not only women, but also American democracy when those newly empowered ladies sought an equal voice. Indeed, Grow Gold changed the entire nation. The unprecedented wealth it generated resulted in the area becoming a state years before its neighboring territories. A railroad spanning the entire continent was built to enable travel for the multitudes wanting to acquire some of the miraculous metal and avail themselves of its magical properties. But first, Grow Gold had to be found and raven haired Susan McAllister was the very first to do so. The year was 1848 and the day was cool and cloudy. The town was Coloma in northern California, along the banks surrounding the South Fork of the American River. A spot north of Sutter’s Mill was the location. Susan saw the metallic chips resting on a stream bed near the mill. She had recently been hired to work there as a cook. The previous cook, Jenny, had fallen ill a few days ago. Mr. James Marshall, one of the mill operators, had also taken sick. The small metallic flakes were tucked into the side of Susan’s bonnet. “So shiny and bright!” she thought. Susan had not seen much gold. At least, not in its raw form when it comes out of the Earth. It could be said that Susan’s breasts were roughly comparable in size to an ordinary, that is to say garden-variety, apple. At least, that was the situation beforehand. It was a different story altogether after tucking the metallic chips into her bonnet. The radioactivity thrust in and out in a rhythmic fashion, penetrating with otherworldly energy, impregnating her cells with superhuman potential. Her perky and respectable bosoms increased in size and reached more than merely respectable proportions as honeydew melons would more accurately describe their current dimensions. Susan was oblivious, as her now oversized bosom was completely concealed. She was also five foot six inches when she returned to town, compared to a few hours earlier when she was only five foot five. I cannot recall my bodice ever feeling so tight. Susan thought. Must be all the excitement, I can’t wait to show this to Paul! Susan and her husband Paul had been working hard to build a new life for themselves. They met and married in Missouri and had only recently moved. Susan’s discovery engendered hope that the couple would have a means to greatly enhance their lives in this new home. Susan wanted nothing more than to tell her husband, but she was overdue for a meeting. The subject was a community effort to fund the construction of a new Episcopalian church, the Emmanuel Church. She finally arrived at the meeting, only a few minutes late. Her more than just respectable curves were still magnifying. Underneath her demure attire the curves of Susan’s body were accentuating. Yet, Susan was initially oblivious, even as her body strained against the whalebone reinforced dress. “Susan.” A gray-haired lady said. The gaunt widow was Blanche Beauregard, originally from a rich family in New Orleans. “Good morning Ms. Beauregard.” Susan said while making her way to an empty spot in the back of the room. As Susan sat there, the tightness increased and became near unbearable. Heavens, this is quite uncomfortable! she thought. I must talk to a tailor about letting my dress out. Unbeknownst to the formerly petite beauty, a spot on the side of her dress had pulled apart, exposing pale skin underneath. The noise of its destruction was overheard by Ms. Beauregard. The widow gestured toward the widening gap. “Goodness! This is my best dress, I’m afraid I must retire ladies. Please assure the Bishop that I will do my part to erect the new house of worship.” Susan said then rapidly left the room before anyone could respond. As her body jiggled and shook with her movements, the extra bounce did not go unnoticed. “Good heavens, I never realized that her silhouette was so … robust.” A blonde named Karen noted. “It’s unseemly for a lady to expose herself, particularly in front of a man of God.” Ms. Beauregard stood up and moved to follow Susan. “Ms. Beauregard, surely you recognize that the poor woman never intended that to happen. What’s more, Bishop Morgan did not notice anything.” Karen remarked. The spinster said nothing, but had a stern countenance when she left. Suddenly, a sharp pain halted the mad dash home. Susan stopped abruptly outside the town saloon. A horse was tied to a hitching post nearby. Susan bent over as the pain racked her body. She moaned and arched her back as the top finally yielded to the shapely form underneath. Buttons flung off her chest and one struck the nearby stallion in his nose. He reared back and whinnied in surprise. “Sorry Beaufort!” Susan said. Susan’s face turned red when she imagined strangers investigating the commotion and then gawking at her nudity. Susan also heard Ms. Beauregard calling her name. Tarnation, what does that old bitty want? Can’t she see I got enough problems? Susan looked around in a panic and quickly darted across the way to the blacksmith’s barn. Thankfully, no horses were present and Susan would not have to fret about startling another beast of burden. Susan dashed behind a makeshift wall of hay bales sectioning off part of the space. She heard men running outside to check on old Beaufort. I can hide here. She thought. Susan threw the torn shreds of what used to be a dress into the corner, as well as the bonnet which had become uncomfortably constricting. Why is this happening? Then Susan noticed that the shiny metal had fallen to the ground when she tossed the bonnet. The metal still shone, but not as much as it was earlier. Susan squinted, wondering if it was the catalyst. Perhaps that’s not gold after all? She heard those voices from the saloon coming closer. Susan stayed motionless behind the hay. Those folks should just leave things be. Beaufort is fine, why are they looking for me? Then she recognized one of the voices. Paul? Is that you? Were you in the saloon? She thought, but said nothing. Susan pressed her face against the hay, digging slender fingers between two bales to spread them apart and enable a clear view. She saw not only the diminutive brown-haired man that was her husband, but also that their neighbor’s adult son Taylor was with them. Great, Taylor is here too. Then she noticed that her perspective was shifting ever higher. No, no, NO! Taylor’s eyes shifted around the room and then he stared at the hay bales for a moment. Christ Almighty, please don’t let him look up. Susan thought. But her prayer went unanswered. Taylor’s eyes raised. Damn it Taylor. The inexperienced fellow stammered and pointed. “Boo-, Boo-, BOOBIES! Giant boobies! Great giant gorgeous boobies!” shouted Taylor. Susan admired her figure. Well, he’s not wrong. My chest is fabulous, and they’re bigger than watermelons! She chuckled to herself thinking that she had unwittingly made Taylor’s first peek at a woman a rather impressive event. Susan’s head pressed against the roof, she placed her palms against the roof and shoved. Weathered, untreated wooden boards snapped and flew off the roof. Susan’s body expanded out of the resulting hole, until her generous bosom rested comfortably on the top. Susan looked around a bit. Ms. Beauregard harrumphed, but left the area forthwith. Paul heard the words “Giant boobies!” still being shouted by Taylor, but those cries were now joined by shouts of “She’s the devil!” by Ms. Beauregard. “I think so. At least it feels that way.” Susan looked down, searching for the magical metal. She finally spotted it, its luster had vanished and it shone no longer. Back inside the saloon, blacksmith Jeb had helped himself to a free beer when everyone else ran out. Eventually, Jeb decided to mosey on out and see what all the hubbub was about. Once outside, his jaw dropped. “What in the name of the Good Lord above!?” He stood there slack-jawed. She nodded and Jeb took off like the fires of damnation were nipping at his heels. Thus, Betsy would be the second to join Susan as the world’s very first giantesses. In time, as more Grow Gold was discovered, Susan and Betsy were joined by women from every corner of the globe. The country, and humanity, would never be the same again.\n\nen\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nAmerica has one heck of a sweet tooth. We consume more sweeteners per capita than any other country, and close to ten million tons of sugar every year. But . When it’s blended with gasoline, it reduces greenhouse-gas emissions. Unlike fossil fuels, it doesn’t get depleted over time, since it’s made from biomass. And sources of ethanol can be found all over the world, unlike those of oil, which are mostly in unstable or autocratic countries that are unfriendly to the U.S. So Congress has mandated that four billion gallons of ethanol annually be blended with gasoline, and it also subsidizes ethanol production with a fifty-one-cent-per-gallon tax credit. These policies have stimulated an ethanol boom; the number of ethanol plants is set to rise by nearly fifty per cent in the next few years. does. . We could, of course, simply import sugar ethanol. But here, too, politics has intervened: Congress has imposed a tariff of fifty-four cents per gallon on sugar-based ethanol in order to protect corn producers from competition.

At the heart of the novel is the plight of Josiah Crawley, a proud, impoverished clergyman who faces difficult legal circumstances. Caught amidst poverty, Josiah appears to have stolen a cheque and is forced to stand trial – despite the fact that he cannot remember the cheque’s origins. To make matters worse, his daughter Grace desperately seeks the approval of Archdeacon Grantly, whose son she intends to marry. The Last Chronicle of Barset is a joyful end to Trollope’s series of Barsetshire novels. Here Trollope skillfully weaves together plot threads and characters from earlier novels in the series and provides a fond farewell tour of his cherished diocese. David Shaw-Parker has recorded extensively for BBC Radio; his recordings for Naxos AudioBooks include The Great Poets: John Clare, The Pilgrim’s Progress and The Chronicles of Barsetshire.

The new feature promises to help reduce the time spent by staff walking to investigate calls from residents in continuing and elderly care facilities. Ascom teleCARE IP has always had hardwired speech functionality. But by making it wireless, residents can simply use their normal mobile phones to communicate directly with caregivers via Ascom teleCARE IP. Caregivers can communicate with residents while on the go, and can deal with residents’ calls before walking to investigate. The newly released (Ascom teleCARE IP 12) is available globally.

What’s the most unusual thing you’ve seen while out for a ride? Probably the top of a steep hill appearing magically, without much puffing and blowing and strain. There are moments biking when you and the bike seem to be still and road is moving beneath you. I remember that from rowing, too. It is always a joy and a surprise when it happens.

Don'u're after in life, you'll make the grade when you're sporting this fine specimenI'm th impressed with the look of the Dark Grey Herringbone Tweed 3 Piece Suit and received multiple compliments on the style and particularly the buttons and the vest. Although, I will say that the buttons were more orange than brown as I expected. Nonetheless, it looked sharp. I ordered the suit just over a month before my daughter's wedding and it arrived with plenty of time to try it on and consider the fit. The help at Tweedmaker confirmed the measurements and I was able to tweak ones based on their suggestion, which turned out spot on. I'd recommend this suit and company to any fine gentlemen, and for the rest of us as well. Suit fits much nicer than my lighter wool suits. For tweed, it is not bulky and gives me a much better form than most of my other dress clothes. I like having options of a complete suit as well wearing the pieces separately. Doing the measurements myself, I had great customer service as some of the measurements needed adjustments and it all worked out in the end. I ended up ordering another suit as it is rare to get a custom suit with all the details for a decent price. It took a while to come and there were some posting issues. But when it got here it is amazing!! Just what I needed!'t n'tSeeing the suit first time on a hanger I wasn't sure! However as soon as I tried on the suit I was very happy ! Top cut and fit feels really good quality for a really great price ! I was actually pretty surprised by how comfortable the suit was! I couldn't be happier with how it turned out!\n\nen\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nFuture Little Loved Ones An inflatable pool makes a great safe play area for babies and toddlers. | 33 Genius Hacks Guaranteed To Make A Parent’s Job Easier cute way to remember what you almost named your baby in a scrapbook or photo shoot! :) the Turquoise frame [from the treetop...] dallas/ft worth newborn photographer Organization@Veronica Sartori Sartori Kilpatrick this seems easy and cute!

Thanks GnG – I did make copies for my sisiters and we have them stored somewhere safe.\n\nen\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nI got given this synth a while ago (thats right for free!) in a non working state...when I turned it on it proclaimed on its little LCD \"cng ram bat\"..so thats what I did. I've had to do this on a couple of old bits of kit in my arsenal now and invariably when you find the ram backup battery it is soldered to the pcb via solder tags that are spot welded to the battery..no exception in this case (see pic below). It's sometimes hard to find the required battery with the solder tags welded on so most of the time a better option is to wire a small battery holder to the original pcb points that can hold a comparable battery. So this battery is a cr2032 which is pretty common but I've still soldered in a battery holder so that in ten years time when I need to do this again I can just clip a battery in without breaking out the soldering iron. For those who may need to do this job in the future and stumble here...it's not immediately apparent where the ram battery is once you get the back off of this synth...this picture shows the board (big green tick) and the corner (green spot) where it is..you need to remove the six screws holding this board to the frame and I found I didn't have to undo all the connectors to the board just the one labelled \"cnd1\"..that allowed me to lift the board to a workable angle That last pic shows how I attached a couple of short leads to the points where I'd removed the old battery and connected the new battery holder (actually one I'de scavenged from an old computer motherboard.. most of these use cr2032 to backup the bios ram in battery holders) I taped this into a little space I found so it wouldn't rattle and then put it all back together. Then I've got nothing else done apart from playing around with it all afternoon! It's a great synth..people overlook them as they are interested in the DX7 which has 6 operators instead of the DX11's 4 but then the DX11 has 6 different waveforms available for each operator (the DX7 only has sin waves) so it's a pretty even match in my humble opinion and can with experimentation create some glorious digital fm goodness. Native GBA tracking.... M4Gtracker As yet unreleased in alpha stages...I've been playing with the alphas of this new tracker, M4Gtracker. It's being built by an absolute hero called Smiker...the work this guy is putting in is amazing with new alpha's peppering the last few days. Check the video above where he shows off the fm synth (stick with it sound begins around the 1 minute marker) and read more about it here. It's definitely worth following the progress and if you have a gba and a flashcart or an emulator give the alpha's a whirl. Posted by concretedog at 10:55 No comments: My good friend Lungwah regularly uses in ear binaural mics and I've always dug the sound he achieves in his field recordings. Having recently got a boss micro br portable 4track recorder I wanted to not only use it as a 4track but, as it can record straight to wav or mp3, as a field recorder too. So I've made my own binaural mics...its a really simple job. I found a couple of electret mic elements (I had a pair in one of my many scraps boxes but you could buy them here for example) and an old pair of earbuds that are large enough to house the mic elements. Simply crack the earbud cases open, desolder the headphone elements, work out which wire is signal and which is ground and then solder in your mic elements. Most electret mic elements have 2 solder blobs on the back, one for ground and one for signal, the way to tell which is which is that the ground contact will have a trace going out to the case of the element. If you click the link above these are visible on the picture. The earbuds I used had a small vent from inside to the exterior of the case anyway but I made it bigger to expose more of the mic element, you can see this in the picture just above the classy gold bands! I then used a spot of hot glue to hold the elements in place and reaassembled the earbud cases. I was done in about 10 minutes. I'm pleased with the sound results from these and enjoy the fact that you can be doing a field recording and yet not draw any attention as you are only wearing earbuds....which happily had a L and R on them so I even manage to get them in the right ear! I was asked in comments to upload a sample recording...here we are DIY Binaural Mics...walking in lunch hour by concretedog It's not the wildest thing I've ever uploaded, it's me just walking for a couple of minutes from my office door into town..highlights include, a pram wheeling beside me, cars passing, a phone ringing in a garage and some seagulls! It's recorded on the hifi (compressed setting) on the micro br, then exported on the unit as a mp3 transferred to computer for trimming and converting into wav (for bandcamp). I think you get a good idea of the soundscape if you listen to this through headphones.\n\nen\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nInvestigations on the Hyperfine and Superhyperfine Interaction Parameters for CsGeF:Mn Theoretical Studies on the Gyromagnetic Factors and the Hyperfine Structure Constants for the Tetragonal Copper Center in KTaO FT-IR Spectroscopic Study on Some Hofmann-T Type Complexes: Ni(4-Phenylpyridine)M(CN)\n\nen\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nNew Delhi [India], June 29 : Minutes after Supreme Court gave its go ahead to floor test in the Maharashtra assembly on Wednesday, ...

Recent end-to-end modeling techniques promise a principled way of overcoming these issues by allowing joint training of all model components and removing the need for explicit intermediate representations. However, a closer look reveals that many end-to-end models fall short of solving these issues, due to compromises made to address data scarcity. This paper provides a unifying categorization and nomenclature that covers both traditional and recent approaches and that may help researchers by highlighting both trade-offs and open research questions.. </s> Abu Dis, Container (Wadi Nar), Sheikh Saed, Thu 25.3.10, Morning Shosh, Rita M-P., Michaela R.

As coronavirus developments continue, there will be substantial capital flows, especially with funds facing pressure to raise cash. Global coronavirus developments will continue to be the principal market focus in the short term. There will be some data releases which will start to show the impact of coronavirus on European and US economies. The number of cases in Italy and spread across Spain will be an important focus during the week. US developments may prove to be pivotal for market sentiment during the week. Central bank action will be important Actions by global central banks will remain important, although there is little fresh action that can be taken on interest rates given that they have been cut to near zero in all major economies. Government actions even more crucial The actions of governments are likely to be even more important for sentiment with pressure for further measures to support demand and supply conditions. In particular, markets will be monitoring fiscal developments in The US and Euro-zone. The latest jobless claims release will be watched very closely on Thursday. Layoffs in the economy will increase sharply and the jobless claims figure is liable to show a big jump with consensus forecasts for a figure of around 750,000 from 281,000 last week. The flash reports for March business confidence are due for release on Tuesday and will provide some evidence on the early impact of coronavirus disruption to the domestic economy. Inflation data is due for release on Wednesday, but is unlikely to have a significant impact with retail sales data due on Thursday.

The cost savings from international emissions trading could produce nearly double the climate ambition at the same overall cost as complying with Paris Agreement targets without international markets. The results indicated that global emissions trading could reduce the total mitigation cost of meeting current Paris pledges by 59 percent to 79 percent. This translates to about $300 to $400 billion in current value terms over 2020-2035, with the high end of the range assuming that Reductions in Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), over and beyond what is needed to meet NDCs, are included in markets. Figure 1: Emissions reductions under various scenarios for market coverage, holding total cost constant. Estimated emissions reductions achievable under the base case (current policies) and four scenarios for increased international market coverage, holding total cost constant. Ambition increases even with limited global markets Carbon pricing policies that encourage international cooperation —such as carbon markets—may be able to capture significantly more cost savings, and thus increased ambition, than carbon pricing policies that are less prone to linkage REDD+ increases ambition significantly Figure 2: Emissions reductions from market scenarios relative to current policies, with and without forests.
