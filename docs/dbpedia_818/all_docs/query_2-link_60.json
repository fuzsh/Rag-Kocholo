Williamson, and played in shows including Robinson Crusoe, Love Lies and So This Is Love, and then toured Australasia, the United Kingdom and South Africa, doing shows under various arrangements, and moving from performers to promoters. In 1951 they moved to Perth, Western Australia to manage His Majesty's Theatre, taking a lease on the venue in 1954. Clem Dawe died the following year. In 1958 the company purchased His Majesty's Theatre and undertook extensive renovation work. From the early 1960s Eric Edgley arranged tours to Australasia from Russian performing troupes including the Bolshoi Ballet, the Georgian State Dance Company and the Moscow Variety Theatre.
