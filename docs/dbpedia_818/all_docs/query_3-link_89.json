        "text": "Thwaites family\n\nHistorical information about the Thwaite. surname.Recorded in a number of spellings as shown below, this is an English surname but one of pre 7th century Norse-Viking origins. It may be either topographical or locational, and is derived from the word “thveit”, meaning a clearing or farm. As a topographical surname, Thwaite(s) denotes residence in or by such a place whiilst as a locational surname it originates from any one of the various places called “Thwaite”, found in several parts of Northern England and East Anglia to the south. The surname development from ancient times includes examples such as Alan del Twayt of Yorkshire in 1301, Robert del Twaytes of the same county in 1379, William Twaytes of Suffolk in 1492, and Matthew Thwayts of Oxfordshire in 1618. The various ‘modern’ spelling forms include Thwaite, Thwaites, Thwaytes, Thoytes, Twaite, Twatt, Twaites, Tweats and Twite. The plural forms denote “of Thwaite” and are similar to the French ‘de’. An example of a recordings taken from surviving church registers is that of the christening of Thomas Thwaite, the son of John Thwaite, on January 22nd 1461, at Lofthouse with Carlton, in Yorkshire. An early coat of arms granted to the Thwaites family of Marston in Yorkshire, depicts a gold fess between three gold estoiles on an blue shield. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Ralph del Thweit. This was dated 1206, in the Pipe Rolls of Norfolk, during the reign of King John of England, 1199 – 1216. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to “develop” often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. ‘ Copyright: Name Orgin Research www.surnamedb.com 1980 – 2010.\n\nLast update Nov 2021.\n\nThanks to Jim Humphrey in Australia for information about Marmaduke Thwaites. {June 2020]\n\nHe would welcome help with his research into this family. Marmaduke was living in Grewelthorpe in 1741, and had as far as I can see 7 children John 1737-1817, William Thwaites 1739; Mary 1741; Thomas 1744-1811; Jane 1748; Marmaduke 1750-1811; Edward 1753-1836. I am trying to follow up in these children. But I believe Marmaduke moved to London as he is listed at the Tower, and also served on a Coroners Court in LOndon. He had a son Edward who was baptised at St Dunstans in the West 16 October 1785. If you have any additional information please could you advise me. Thank you. Jim Humphrey\n\nJim’s email address is jimhumphrey@bigpond.com\n\nDetails of Thwaites family from the Grewelthorpe area.Mark Andrew & Joy Hatchett has sent the following information.\n\nMAGGIE THWAITES. Born 2 June 1883 Grewelthorpe. Died 26.6.1952. Married 21 April 1900 to Robert Henry Prest. of Kirkby Malzeard. They had a son Bertram Prest. Grewelthorpe school records show that Maggie was the daughter of Arthur. She started Grewelthorpe school in June 1888 and left to go to work in 1897. In 1911 living Kirkby Malzeard.\n\nMaggie Prest.\n\nGrave of Robert & Maggie in Kirkby Malzeard churchyard.\n\nRobert & Maggie [nee Thwaites] Prest.\n\nThanks to Joy Hatchett for photo.\n\nAdrial Walton has sent the following request for information.I am interested in the Thwaites family which I am researching on behalf of a friend. On the Grewelthorpe genealogy website is listed a John Thwaites, born 1880. I know that he married Hannah Maria Jones in June 1913. On the marriage certificate his occupation is given as woodman, hers as domestic servant, the 1901 census has him entered as a stocksman. It therefore seems possible that both John and Hannah Maria were employed by a large house or estate at the time of their marriage.The witnesses of the marriage were Robert Henry and Maggie Prest. This would appear to be the Maggie Thwaites mentioned by Mark Andrew in his post to your site dated 7 Jan 2009. She was John’s sister.Hannah Maria’s father is given as David Jones, a collier, and I understand from my friend that she came from Wales, though exactly where is not known. The combination of names and occupation is by no means unique so that I have been unable to identify her family unambiguously from census returns. I therefore wonder if records survive from any houses or estates (Hackfall?, Bramley Grange?) in the area which might give more information about employees. I would be very grateful if you have any suggestions or if you could put me in touch with anyone else who might know.\n\nMany thanks for any help you can give on this.\n\nThanks to Stewart Hall for information about the Thwaites & Hall families.\n\nAlso from school, census & Parish records.\n\nALEXANDER THWAITES.
