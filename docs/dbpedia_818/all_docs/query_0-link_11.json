Ilfrey scored a total of 7.5 aerial victories, but is not listed with the 20th FG top aces because those kills were scored whilst flying with the 94th FS, 1st FG, which is where his kills are listed.\n\nA complete list of all aerial kills scored within each Fighter Group will be presented within that Fighter Group's biography in the United States Army Air Corps section of the Mustang pages.\n\nPlease feel free to contact us via e-mail or through the contact form on our website\n\nPlease like and follow us on Facebook!"
