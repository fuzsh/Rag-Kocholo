        "text": "AVO Analysis of a Shallow Gas Accumulation in the Marmara Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEr, M.; Dondurur, D.; ÃifÃ§i, G.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn recent years, Amplitude versus Offset-AVO analysis is widely used in determination and classification of gas anomalies from wide-offset seismic data. Bright spots which are among the significant factors in determining the hydrocarbon accumulations, can also be determined sucessfully using AVO analysis. A bright spot anomaly were identified on the multi-channel seismic data collected by R/V K. Piri Reis research vessel in the Marmara Sea in 2008. On prestack seismic data, the associated AVO anomalies are clearly identified on the supergathers. Near- and far-offset stack sections are plotted to show the amplitudes changes at different offsets and the bright amplitudes were observed on the far-offset stack. AVO analysis was applied to the observed bright spot anomaly following the standart data processing steps. The analysis includes the preparation of Intercept, Gradient and Fluid Factor sections of AVO attribues. Top and base boundaries of gas bearing sediment were shown by intercept - gradient crossplot method. 1D modelling was also performed to show AVO classes and models were compared with the analysis results. It is interpreted that the bright spot anomaly arises from a shallow gas accumulation. In addition, the gas saturation from P-wave velocity was also estimated by the analysis. AVO analysis indicated Class 3 and Class 4 AVO anomalies observed on the bright spot anomaly.\n\nThree-parameter AVO crossplotting in anisotropic media\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHao, Chen; Castagna, J.P.; Brown, R.L.; Ramos, A.C.B.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nAmplitude versus offset (AVO) interpretation can be facilitated by crossplotting AVO intercept (A), gradient (B), and curvature (C) terms. However, anisotropy, which exists in the real world, usually complicates AVO analysis. Recognizing anisotropic behavior on AVO crossplots can help avoid AVO interpretation errors. Using a modification to a three-term (A, B, and C) approximation to the exact anisotropic reflection coefficients for transversely isotropic media, we find that anisotropy has a nonlinear effect on an A versus C crossplot yet causes slope changes and differing intercepts on A versus B or C crossplots. Empirical corrections that result in more accurate crossplot interpretation are introduced for specific circumstances.\n\nDirect hydrocarbon identification using AVO analysis in the Malay Basin\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLye, Y.C.; Yaacob, M.R.; Birkett, N.E.\n\n1994-07-01\n\nEsso Production Malaysia Inc. and Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. have been conducting AVO (amplitude versus offset) processing and interpretation since April 1991 in an attempt to identify hydrocarbon fluids predrill. The major part of this effort was in the PM-5, PM-8, and PM-9 contract areas where an extensive exploration program is underway. To date, more than 1000 km of seismic data have been analyzed using the AVO technique, and the results were used to support the drilling of more than 50 exploration and delineation wells. Gather modeling of well data was used to calibrate and predict the presence of hydrocarbonmoreÂ Â» in proposed well locations. In order to generate accurate gather models, a geophysical properties and AVO database was needed, and great effort was spent in producing an accurate and complete database. This database is continuously being updated so that an experience file can be built to further improve the reliability of the AVO prediction.Â«Â less\n\nNew discovered Izmir and Busan Mud Volcanoes and Application of Seismic Attributes and AVO Analysis in the Easternmost Black Sea.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOkay, S.; Cifci, G.; Ozel, S.; Atgin, O.; Ozel, O.; Barin, B.; Er, M.; Dondurur, D.; Kucuk, M.; Gurcay, S.; Choul Kim, D.; Sung-Ho, B.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nRecently, the continental margins of Black Sea became important for its gas content. There are no scientific researches offshore Trabzon-Giresun area except the explorations of oil companies. This is the first survey that performed in that area. 1700 km high resolution multichannel seismic and chirp data simultaneously were collected onboard R/V K.Piri Reis . The seismic data reveal BSRs, bright spots and acoustic maskings especially on the eastern part of the survey area. The survey area in the Eastern Black Sea includes continental slope, apron and deep basin. Two mud volcanoes are discovered and named as Busan and Izmir. The observed fold belt is believed to be the main driving force for the growth of mud volcanoes.Faults are developed at the flanks of diapiric uplift. Seismic attributes and AVO analysis are applied to 9 seismic sections which have probable gassy sediments and BSR zones. In the seismic attribute analysis high amplitude horzions with reverse polarity are observed in instantaneous frequency, envelope and apparent polarity sections also with low frequency at instantaneous frequency sections. These analysis verify existence of gas accumulations in the sediments. AVO analysis and cross section drawing and Gradient analysis show Class 1 AVO anomaly and indicate gas in sediments.

Amplitude variation with offset (AVO) in three dimensions is the key exploration tool in deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. But application of the tool requires special care. Three-dimensional AVO helps the interpreter understand stratigraphy and the meaning of amplitude anomalies. Used in conjunction with well log data, it can help the interpreter distinguish amplitudes related to the presence of hydrocarbons from those that result from, for example, rock-property changes within a non-hydrocarbon-bearing layer, such as a shale, ormoreÂ Â» residual gas (fizz water) in high-porosity sands. The paper discusses examples from the Gulf of Mexico, will control application, improving detail, and frequency-dependent analysis.Â«Â less\n\nAVO analysis of BSR to assess free gas within fine-grained sediments in the Shenhu area, South China Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQian, Jin; Wang, Xiu-Juan; Wu, Shi-Guo; Wang, Zhen-zhen; Yang, Sheng-Xiong\n\n2014-06-01\n\nGas hydrates have been identified from two-dimensional (2D) seismic data and logging data above bottom simulating reflector (BSR) during China's first gas hydrate drilling expedition in 2007. The multichannel reflection seismic data were processed to be preserved amplitudes for quantitatively analyzing amplitude variation with offset (AVO) at BSRs. Low P-wave velocity anomaly below BSR, coinciding with high amplitude reflections in 2D seismic data, indicates the presence of free gas. The absolute values of reflection coefficient versus incidence angles for BSR range from 0 to 0.12 at different CMPs near Site SH2. According to logging data and gas hydrate saturations estimated from resistivity of Site SH2, P-wave velocities calculated from effective media theory (EMT) fit the measured sonic velocities well and we choose EMT to calculate elastic velocities for AVO. The rock-physics modeling and AVO analysis were combined to quantitatively assess free gas saturations and distribution by the reflection coefficients variation of the BSRs in Shenhu area, South China Sea. AVO estimation indicates that free gas saturations immediately beneath BSRs may be about 0.2 % (uniform distribution) and up to about 10 % (patchy distribution) at Site SH2.\n\nTime lapse (4D) and AVO analysis: A case study of Gullfaks field, Northern North Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUmoren, Emmanuel Bassey; George, Nyakno Jimmy\n\n2018-06-01\n\nA 4D seismic or time lapse survey has been used to investigate the amplitude versus offset (AVO) effects on seismic data in order to identify anomalies in the Gullfaks field for three different reservoir intervals namely the Tarbert, Cook and Statfjord reservoirs. Repeatability analysis has shown that the earlier seismic vintages are the most unreliable for amplitude anomaly analysis as normalised root-mean square (NRMS) values are greater than 50%. This is above the threshold of good and medium repeatability. Fluid substitution models show increases in both P-wave velocity and density for increasing water saturations with a maximum change of 7.33% in the P-wave velocity, and this is in line with predictions from previous work using the Biot - Gassman equations. AVO modelling for the top Tarbert Formation interface produced scenarios of increasing amplitudes with offset for the presence of hydrocarbons, which dim out with 100% brine saturation. This correlates to class III gas sands for different situations of varying Poisson's ratio across an interface, which has been previously modelled. Two anomalies were identified with one being related to increasing pressure due to water injection correlating to poor permeability around injector well 34/10-B-33. The second anomaly is a case of potential unswept hydrocarbons that displayed a consistent bright spot throughout all of the seismic vintages (in-inlines and crosslines). AVO attribute analysis of this event produced a class II anomaly. However, when comparing near and far offset seismic data, dimming effect was observed producing contrasting evidence. The dimming offset is viewed to have been as a result of poor repeatability values at far offsets. The modelling of the fluid contents in the studied formations to conform to existing literatures justifies the efficacy of the method.\n\nSeismic AVO response character of coal bed methane content in the Zhaozhuang coalmine of Qinshui Basin,China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZou, G.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCoal bed methane content (CBMC) is a measure of the quantity of methane stored in coals, and is important for many applications, including the quantitative assessment of methane resources and methane extraction and control. The coal bed methane content (CBMC) in the Zhaozhuang coalmine of Jincheng coalfield, northwestern Qinshui Basin, is studied based on seismic data and well-logs together with laboratory measurements. The amplitude versus offset (AVO) response from the log characteristics was analyzed and the seismic amplitude, after relative preserved amplitude processing, was corrected to maintain the relative amplitude characteristics. The AVO attributes were calculated based on AVO theory and the statistical relationship between AVO attributes and CBMC was established and used to predict the CBMC. The results show that the Shuey approximation has better adaptability according to the Zoeppritz equation result; the designed fold number for an ordinary seismic data is insufficient for pre-stack data regarding the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Therefore a larger grid analysis was created in order to improve the SNR. The velocity field created by logging is better than that created by stack velocity in both accuracy and effectiveness. A reasonable distribution of the amplitude versus offset (AVO) attributes can be facilitated by taking the AVO response from logging as a standard for calibrating the amplitude distribution. Some AVO attributes have a close relationship with CBMC. The worst attribute is weighted polarization product, for which the correlation coefficient is 0.23; and the best attribute is the intercept, of which the correlation coefficient is -0.79. CBMC predicted by AVO attributes is better overall than that predicted by direct interpolation of CBMC; the validation error of the former is 12.5%, which is lower than that of the latter. CBMC of this area ranges from 7.1 m3/t to 21.4 m3/t.\n\nNonlinear Classification of AVO Attributes Using SVM\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, B.; Zhou, H.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nA key research topic in reservoir characterization is the detection of the presence of fluids using seismic and well-log data. In particular, partial gas discrimination is very challenging because low and high gas saturation can result in similar anomalies in terms of Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO), bright spot, and velocity sag. Hence, a successful fluid detection will require a good understanding of the seismic signatures of the fluids, high-quality data, and good detection methodology. Traditional attempts of partial gas discrimination employ the Neural Network algorithm. A new approach is to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995; Liu and Sacchi, 2003). While the potential of the SVM has not been fully explored for reservoir fluid detection, the current nonlinear methods classify seismic attributes without the use of rock physics constraints. The objective of this study is to improve the capability of distinguishing a fizz-water reservoir from a commercial gas reservoir by developing a new detection method using AVO attributes and rock physics constraints. This study will first test the SVM classification with synthetic data, and then apply the algorithm to field data from the King-Kong and Lisa-Anne fields in Gulf of Mexico. While both field areas have high amplitude seismic anomalies, King-Kong field produces commercial gas but Lisa-Anne field does not. We expect that the new SVM-based nonlinear classification of AVO attributes may be able to separate commercial gas from fizz-water in these two fields.\n\nAVO in North of Paria, Venezuela: Gas methane versus condensate reservoirs\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRegueiro, J.; Pena, A.\n\n1996-07-01\n\nThe gas fields of North of Paria, offshore eastern Venezuela, present a unique opportunity for amplitude variations with offset (AVO) characterization of reservoirs containing different fluids: gas-condensate, gas (methane) and water (brine). AVO studies for two of the wells in the area, one with gas-condensate and the other with gas (methane) saturated reservoirs, show interesting results. Water sands and a fluid contact (condensate-water) are present in one of these wells, thus providing a control point on brine-saturated properties. The reservoirs in the second well consist of sands highly saturated with methane. Clear differences in AVO response exist between hydrocarbon-saturated reservoirsmoreÂ Â» and those containing brine. However, it is also interesting that subtle but noticeable differences can be interpreted between condensate-and methane-saturated sands. These differences are attributed to differences in both in-situ fluid density and compressibility, and rock frame properties.Â«Â less\n\nReconnaissance Data Recording Study\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1996-02-15\n\nSources The data sources listed are those sources that are currently being used for the Advanced Tactical Air Reconnaissance System ( ATARS ).

They are spanning the time from 1938 until the end of the war and even beyond. Photo reconnaissance provided intelligence information for the Allied headquarters and accompanied the bombing offensive against the German homeland and the occupied territories. One of the initial principal targets in Bohemia were the synthetized fuel works STW AG (SudetenlÃ¤ndische Treibstoffwerke AG) in Zaluzi (formerly Maltheuren) near Most (formerly BrÃ¼ck), Czech Republic. The STW AG synthetized fuel plant was not only subject to bombing raids, but a subject to quite intensive photo reconnaissance, too - long before the start of the bombing campaign. With a multi-temporal analysis of the available imagery from international archives we will demonstrate the factory build-up during 1942 and 1943, the effects of the bombing raids in 1944 and the struggle to keep the plant working in the last year of the war. Furthermore we would like to show the impact the bombings have today, in form of potential unexploded ordnance in the adjacent area of the open cast mines.\n\nProbabilistic Thermal Analysis During Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Aerobraking\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDec, John A.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nA method for performing a probabilistic thermal analysis during aerobraking has been developed. The analysis is performed on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter solar array during aerobraking. The methodology makes use of a response surface model derived from a more complex finite element thermal model of the solar array. The response surface is a quadratic equation which calculates the peak temperature for a given orbit drag pass at a specific location on the solar panel. Five different response surface equations are used, one of which predicts the overall maximum solar panel temperature, and the remaining four predict the temperatures of the solar panel thermal sensors. The variables used to define the response surface can be characterized as either environmental, material property, or modeling variables. Response surface variables are statistically varied in a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation produces mean temperatures and 3 sigma bounds as well as the probability of exceeding the designated flight allowable temperature for a given orbit. Response surface temperature predictions are compared with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter flight temperature data.\n\nTarget of rapamycin complex 2 signals to downstream effector yeast protein kinase 2 (Ypk2) through adheres-voraciously-to-target-of-rapamycin-2 protein 1 (Avo1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiao, Hsien-Ching; Chen, Mei-Yu\n\n2012-02-24\n\nThe conserved Ser/Thr kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) serves as a central regulator in controlling cell growth-related functions. There exist two distinct TOR complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, each coupling to specific downstream effectors and signaling pathways. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC2 is involved in regulating actin organization and maintaining cell wall integrity. Ypk2 (yeast protein kinase 2), a member of the cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent, and PKC (AGC) kinase family, is a TORC2 substrate known to participate in actin and cell wall regulation. Employing avo3(ts) mutants with defects in TORC2 functions that are suppressible by active Ypk2, we investigated the molecular interactions involved in mediating TORC2 signaling to Ypk2. GST pulldown assays in yeast lysates demonstrated physical interactions between Ypk2 and components of TORC2. In vitro binding assays revealed that Avo1 directly binds to Ypk2. In avo3(ts) mutants, the TORC2-Ypk2 interaction was reduced and could be restored by AVO1 overexpression, highlighting the important role of Avo1 in coupling TORC2 to Ypk2. The interaction was mapped to an internal region (amino acids 600-840) of Avo1 and a C-terminal region of Ypk2. Ypk2(334-677), a truncated form of Ypk2 containing the Avo1-interacting region, was able to interfere with Avo1-Ypk2 interaction in vitro. Overexpressing Ypk2(334-677) in yeast cells resulted in a perturbation of TORC2 functions, causing defective cell wall integrity, aberrant actin organization, and diminished TORC2-dependent Ypk2 phosphorylation evidenced by the loss of an electrophoretic mobility shift. Together, our data support the conclusion that the direct Avo1-Ypk2 interaction is crucial for TORC2 signaling to the downstream Ypk2 pathway.\n\nThe AVO Website - a Comprehensive Tool for Information Management and Dissemination\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSnedigar, S.; Cameron, C.; Nye, C. J.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) website serves as a primary information management, browsing, and dissemination tool. It is database-driven, thus easy to maintain and update. There are two different, yet fully integrated parts of the website. An external site (www.avo.alaska.edu) allows the general public to track eruptive activity by viewing the latest photographs, webcam images, seismic data, and official information releases about the volcano, as well as maps, previous eruption information, and bibliographies. This website is also the single most comprehensive source of Alaska volcano information available. The database now contains 14,000 images, 3,300 of which are publicly viewable, and 4,300 bibliographic citations - many linked to full-text downloadable files.. The internal portion of the website is essential to routine observatory operations, and hosts browse images of diverse geophysical and geological data in a format accessible by AVO staff regardless of location. An observation log allows users to enter information about anything from satellite passes to seismic activity to ash fall reports into a searchable database, and has become the permanent record of observatory function. The individual(s) on duty at home, at the watch office, or elsewhere use forms on the internal website to log information about volcano activity. These data are then automatically parsed into a number of primary activity notices which are the formal communication to appropriate agencies and interested individuals. Geochemistry, geochronology, and geospatial data modules are currently being developed. The website receives over 100 million hits, and serves 1,300 GB of data annually. It is dynamically generated from a MySQL database with over 300 tables and several thousand lines of php code which write the actual web display. The primary webserver is housed at (but not owned by) the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and currently holds 200 GB of data.

Though the approximate expression is concise and convenient to use, it has certain limitations. For example, its application condition is that the difference of elastic parameters between the upper medium and lower medium is little and the incident angle is small. In addition, the inversion of density is not stable. Therefore, we develop the method of time-lapse joint AVO inversion based on exact Zoeppritz equations. In this method, we apply exact Zoeppritz equations to calculate the reflection coefficient of PP wave. And in the construction of objective function for inversion, we use Taylor series expansion to linearize the inversion problem. Through the joint AVO inversion of seismic data in baseline survey and monitor survey, we can obtain the P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, density in baseline survey and their time-lapse changes simultaneously. We can also estimate the oil saturation change according to inversion results. Compared with the time-lapse difference inversion, the joint inversion doesn't need certain assumptions and can estimate more parameters simultaneously. It has a better applicability. Meanwhile, by using the generalized linear method, the inversion is easily implemented and its calculation cost is small. We use the theoretical model to generate synthetic seismic records to test and analyze the influence of random noise. The results can prove the availability and anti-noise-interference ability of our method. We also apply the inversion to actual field data and prove the feasibility of our method in actual situation.\n\nTime-lapse joint AVO inversion using generalized linear method based on exact Zoeppritz equations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhi, L.; Gu, H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe conventional method of time-lapse AVO (Amplitude Versus Offset) inversion is mainly based on the approximate expression of Zoeppritz equations.

With the increase of noise, P-wave velocity change and oil saturation change are stable and less affected by noise. S-wave velocity change is most affected by noise. Finally we use the actual field data of time-lapse seismic prospecting to process and the results can prove the availability and feasibility of our method in actual situation.\n\nHigh area rate reconnaissance (HARR) and mine reconnaissance/hunter (MR/H) exploratory development programs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLathrop, John D.\n\n1995-06-01\n\nThis paper describes the sea mine countermeasures developmental context, technology goals, and progress to date of the two principal Office of Naval Research exploratory development programs addressing sea mine reconnaissance and minehunting technology development. The first of these programs, High Area Rate Reconnaissance, is developing toroidal volume search sonar technology, sidelooking sonar technology, and associated signal processing technologies (motion compensation, beamforming, and computer-aided detection and classification) for reconnaissance and hunting against volume mines and proud bottom mines from 21-inch diameter vehicles operating in deeper waters. The second of these programs, Amphibious Operation Area Mine Reconnaissance/Hunter, is developing a suite of sensor technologies (synthetic aperture sonar, ahead-looking sonar, superconducting magnetic field gradiometer, and electro-optic sensor) and associated signal processing technologies for reconnaissance and hunting against all mine types (including buried mines) in shallow water and very shallow water from 21-inch diameter vehicles. The technologies under development by these two programs must provide excellent capabilities for mine detection, mine classification, and discrimination against false targets.\n\nGeologic data management at AVO: building authoritative coverage with radical availability (Invited)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCameron, C.; Snedigar, S. F.; Nye, C. J.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nIn 2002, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) began creating the Geologic Database of Information on Volcanoes in Alaska (GeoDIVA) to create a system that contains complete, flexible, timely, and accurate geologic and geographic information on Pleistocene and younger volcanoes in Alaska. This system was primarily intended to be a tool for scientific investigation, crisis response, and public information - delivered in a dynamic, digital format to both internal and external users. It is now the back-end of the AVO public website. GeoDIVA does not interface with our daily monitoring activities, however -- seismic and satellite data are handled by different database efforts. GeoDIVA also doesnât store volcanic unrest data, although we hope WOVOdat will. GeoDIVA does include modules for the following datasets: bibliography (every subsequent piece of data in GeoDIVA is tied to a reference), basic volcano information (~137 edifices), historical eruption history information (~550 events), images (~17,000), sample information (~4400), geochemistry (~1500; population in progress), petrography (very early stages of data creation), sample storage (~14,000), and Quaternary vent information (~1200 vents). Modules in progress include GIS data, tephra data, and geochronologic data. In recent years, we have been doing maintenance work on older modules (for example, adding new references to the bibliography, and creating new queries and data fields in response to user feedback) as well as developing, designing, and populating new modules. Population can be quite time consuming, as there are no pre-compiled comprehensive existing sources for most information on Alaskan volcanoes, and we carefully reference each item. Newer modules also require more complex data arrangements than older modules. To meet the needs of a diverse group of users on widely varying computer platforms, GeoDIVA data is primarily stored in a MySQL DBMS; PostGIS/PostgreSQL are currently used to store and\n\nMultivariate Formation Pressure Prediction with Seismic-derived Petrophysical Properties from Prestack AVO inversion and Poststack Seismic Motion Inversion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYu, H.; Gu, H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA novel multivariate seismic formation pressure prediction methodology is presented, which incorporates high-resolution seismic velocity data from prestack AVO inversion, and petrophysical data (porosity and shale volume) derived from poststack seismic motion inversion. In contrast to traditional seismic formation prediction methods, the proposed methodology is based on a multivariate pressure prediction model and utilizes a trace-by-trace multivariate regression analysis on seismic-derived petrophysical properties to calibrate model parameters in order to make accurate predictions with higher resolution in both vertical and lateral directions. With prestack time migration velocity as initial velocity model, an AVO inversion was first applied to prestack dataset to obtain high-resolution seismic velocity with higher frequency that is to be used as the velocity input for seismic pressure prediction, and the density dataset to calculate accurate Overburden Pressure (OBP). Seismic Motion Inversion (SMI) is an inversion technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Both structural variability and similarity of seismic waveform are used to incorporate well log data to characterize the variability of the property to be obtained. In this research, porosity and shale volume are first interpreted on well logs, and then combined with poststack seismic data using SMI to build porosity and shale volume datasets for seismic pressure prediction. A multivariate effective stress model is used to convert velocity, porosity and shale volume datasets to effective stress. After a thorough study of the regional stratigraphic and sedimentary characteristics, a regional normally compacted interval model is built, and then the coefficients in the multivariate prediction model are determined in a trace-by-trace multivariate regression analysis on the petrophysical data. The coefficients are used to convert velocity, porosity and shale volume datasets to effective stress and then\n\nReconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars CRISM Data Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrink, K.; Hayden, D.; Lecompte, D.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThe Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars CRISM (CRISM) carried aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), is the first visible-infrared spectrometer to fly on a NASA Mars mission. CRISM scientists are using the instrument to look for the residue of minerals that form in the presence of water: the 'fingerprints' left by evaporated hot springs, thermal vents, lakes or ponds. With unprecedented clarity, CRISM is mapping regions on the Martian surface at scales as small as 60 feet (about 18 meters) across, when the spacecraft is 186 miles (300 kilometers) above the planet. CRISM is reading 544 'colors' in reflected sunlight to detect certain minerals on the surface, including signature traces of past water. CRISM alone will generate more than 10 terabytes of data, enough to fill more than 15,000 compact discs. Given that quantity of data being returned by MRO-CRISM, this project partners with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) scientists of the CRISM team to assist in the data analysis process. The CRISM operations team has prototyped and will provide the necessary software analysis tools. In addition, the CRISM operations team will provide reduced data volume representations of the data as PNG files, accessible via a web interface without recourse to specialized user tools. The web interface allows me to recommend repeating certain of the CRISM observations as survey results indicate, and to enter notes on the features present in the images. After analysis of a small percentage of CRISM observations, APL scientists concluded that their efforts would be greatly facilitated by adding a preliminary survey to evaluate the overall characteristics and quality of the CRISM data. The first-look should increase the efficiency and speed of their data analysis efforts. This project provides first-look assessments of the data quality while noting features of interest likely to need further study or additional CRISM observations. The\n\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter Uplink Analysis Tool\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKhanampompan, Teerapat; Gladden, Roy; Fisher, Forest; Hwang, Pauline\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis software analyzes Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) orbital geometry with respect to Mars Exploration Rover (MER) contact windows, and is the first tool of its kind designed specifically to support MRO-MER interface coordination. Prior to this automated tool, this analysis was done manually with Excel and the UNIX command line. In total, the process would take approximately 30 minutes for each analysis. The current automated analysis takes less than 30 seconds. This tool resides on the flight machine and uses a PHP interface that does the entire analysis of the input files and takes into account one-way light time from another input file. Input flies are copied over to the proper directories and are dynamically read into the tool s interface. The user can then choose the corresponding input files based on the time frame desired for analysis. After submission of the Web form, the tool merges the two files into a single, time-ordered listing of events for both spacecraft. The times are converted to the same reference time (Earth Transmit Time) by reading in a light time file and performing the calculations necessary to shift the time formats. The program also has the ability to vary the size of the keep-out window on the main page of the analysis tool by inputting a custom time for padding each MRO event time. The parameters on the form are read in and passed to the second page for analysis. Everything is fully coded in PHP and can be accessed by anyone with access to the machine via Web page. This uplink tool will continue to be used for the duration of the MER mission's needs for X-band uplinks. Future missions also can use the tools to check overflight times as well as potential site observation times. Adaptation of the input files to the proper format, and the window keep-out times, would allow for other analyses. Any operations task that uses the idea of keep-out windows will have a use for this program.\n\nEstimation of the state of solar activity type stars by virtual observations of CrAVO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDolgov, A.

M.\n\n1981-12-01\n\nThe reconnaissance systems of the year 2000 and beyond may be merely an extension of current technology or may utilize bold new technology and concepts still in the embryonic stages. The five basic reconnaissance mission stages: collection, processing, interpretation, reporting, and dissemination, are reviewed in terms of the potential application of new and emerging technology such as high density multispectral focal plane arrays, new radar techniques, VLSI/VHSIC computational resources, artificial intelligence, multisensor integration, pattern and target recognition, image compression, advanced display and targeting techniques, and even new fields not thought of as exact sciences today. The application of these technologies is viewed in the context of the reconnaissance missions: targeting, damage assessment, order of battle assessment, terrain evaluation and planning. The traditional neeos for varying levels of detail and timeliness of reconnaissance data are shown to be largely removed by the use of the most advanced and highest development risk systems. Lower development risk systems show excellent capabilities with the potential for high capability at low cost. New fields may totally change or even eliminate reconnaissance as we know it today.\n\nCamouflage target reconnaissance based on hyperspectral imaging technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHua, Wenshen; Guo, Tong; Liu, Xun\n\n2015-08-01\n\nEfficient camouflaged target reconnaissance technology makes great influence on modern warfare. Hyperspectral images can provide large spectral range and high spectral resolution, which are invaluable in discriminating between camouflaged targets and backgrounds. Hyperspectral target detection and classification technology are utilized to achieve single class and multi-class camouflaged targets reconnaissance respectively. Constrained energy minimization (CEM), a widely used algorithm in hyperspectral target detection, is employed to achieve one class camouflage target reconnaissance. Then, support vector machine (SVM), a classification method, is proposed to achieve multi-class camouflage target reconnaissance. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.\n\nObjective Analysis of Tropical Cyclone Intensity, Strength, and Size Using Routine Aircraft Reconnaissance Data.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1986-05-01\n\n8217..\".. .4.-,: -, 4’.-. -I I\" \" \" . \" \"\" .. -\"\" \" \" \" +,’\" ŗŖ. -II O CHART -JON SECIJRITY CLASSIFICATION OF THIS PAGE (When DateEntered) REPORT ...DOCUMENTATION PAGE BEFORE COMPLETING FORM I.

In all of those positions, I've been challenged many times over with what appeared, at first, to be insurmountable problems that upon closer examination weren't irresolvable after all. All of these problems pale, however, when viewed side-by-side with the one challenge that has faced me since I began my military career and, in fact, faces all of us as I talk with you today. That one challenge is the problem of timeliness. Better put: \"Getting information to our customers firstest with the mostest.\" Together we must develop better platforms and sensors to cure this age-old \"Achilles heel\" in the reconnaissance cycle. Despite all of our best intentions, despite all of the emerging technologies that will be available, and despite all of the dollars that we've thrown at research and development, we in the reconnaissance business still haven't done a good job in this area. We must do better.\n\nKeeping Our Eyes Open: Conducting Aerial Reconnaissance Without Space\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-05-01\n\nworldwide went haywire.

Weighted stacking is often used to improve the performance of conventional equal-weight stacking in further attenuating random noise and handling the amplitude variations in real seismic data. In this study, we propose to use a hybrid framework of combining AB semblance and a local-similarity-weighted stacking scheme. The objective is to achieve an optimal stacking of the CMP gathers with class II amplitude-variation-with-offset (AVO) polarity-reversal anomaly. The selection of high-quality near-offset reference trace is another innovation of this work because of its better preservation of useful energy. Applications to synthetic and field seismic data demonstrate a great improvement using our method to capture the true locations of weak reflections, distinguish thin-bed tuning artifacts, and effectively attenuate random noise.\n\nDeployable reconnaissance from a VTOL UAS in urban environments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarnett, Shane; Bird, John; Culhane, Andrew; Sharkasi, Adam; Reinholtz, Charles\n\n2007-04-01\n\nReconnaissance collection in unknown or hostile environments can be a dangerous and life threatening task. To reduce this risk, the Unmanned Systems Group at Virginia Tech has produced a fully autonomous reconnaissance system able to provide live video reconnaissance from outside and inside unknown structures. This system consists of an autonomous helicopter which launches a small reconnaissance pod inside a building and an operator control unit (OCU) on a ground station. The helicopter is a modified Bergen Industrial Twin using a Rotomotion flight controller and can fly missions of up to one half hour. The mission planning OCU can control the helicopter remotely through teleoperation or fully autonomously by GPS waypoints. A forward facing camera and template matching aid in navigation by identifying the target building. Once the target structure is identified, vision algorithms will center the UAS adjacent to open windows or doorways. Tunable parameters in the vision algorithm account for varying launch distances and opening sizes. Launch of the reconnaissance pod may be initiated remotely through a human in the loop or autonomously. Compressed air propels the half pound stationary pod or the larger mobile pod into the open portals. Once inside the building, the reconnaissance pod will then transmit live video back to the helicopter. The helicopter acts as a repeater node for increased video range and simplification of communication back to the ground station.\n\nStandoff reconnaissance imagery - Applications and interpreter training\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGustafson, G. C.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe capabilities, advantages and applications of Long Range Oblique Photography (LOROP) standoff air reconnaissance cameras are reviewed, with emphasis on the problems likely to be encountered in photo interpreter training. Results of student exercises in descriptive image analysis and mensuration are presented and discussed, and current work on the computer programming of oblique and panoramic mensuration tasks is summarized. Numerous examples of this class of photographs and their interpretation at various magnifications are also presented.\n\nThe time-lapse AVO difference inversion for changes in reservoir parameters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLongxiao, Zhi; Hanming, Gu; Yan, Li\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe result of conventional time-lapse seismic processing is the difference between the amplitude and the post-stack seismic data. Although stack processing can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of seismic data, it also causes a considerable loss of important information about the amplitude changes and only gives the qualitative interpretation. To predict the changes in reservoir fluid more precisely and accurately, we also need the quantitative information of the reservoir. To achieve this aim, we develop the method of time-lapse AVO (amplitude versus offset) difference inversion. For the inversion of reservoir changes in elastic parameters, we apply the Gardner equation as the constraint and convert the three-parameter inversion of elastic parameter changes into a two-parameter inversion to make the inversion more stable. For the inversion of variations in the reservoir parameters, we infer the relation between the difference of the reflection coefficient and variations in the reservoir parameters, and then invert reservoir parameter changes directly. The results of the theoretical modeling computation and practical application show that our method can estimate the relative variations in reservoir density, P-wave and S-wave velocity, calculate reservoir changes in water saturation and effective pressure accurately, and then provide reference for the rational exploitation of the reservoir.\n\nStudy on the shipboard radar reconnaissance equipment azimuth benchmark method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Zhenxing; Jiang, Ning; Ma, Qian; Liu, Songtao; Wang, Longtao\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe future naval battle will take place in a complex electromagnetic environment. Therefore, seizing the electromagnetic superiority has become the major actions of the navy. Radar reconnaissance equipment is an important part of the system to obtain and master battlefield electromagnetic radiation source information. Azimuth measurement function is one of the main function radar reconnaissance equipments. Whether the accuracy of direction finding meets the requirements, determines the vessels successful or not active jamming, passive jamming, guided missile attack and other combat missions, having a direct bearing on the vessels combat capabilities . How to test the performance of radar reconnaissance equipment, while affecting the task as little as possible is a problem. This paper, based on radar signal simulator and GPS positioning equipment, researches and experiments on one new method, which povides the azimuth benchmark required by the direction-finding precision test anytime anywhere, for the ships at jetty to test radar reconnaissance equipment performance in direction-finding. It provides a powerful means for the naval radar reconnaissance equipments daily maintenance and repair work[1].\n\nSensor Control And Film Annotation For Long Range, Standoff Reconnaissance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchmidt, Thomas G.; Peters, Owen L.; Post, Lawrence H.\n\n1984-12-01\n\nThis paper describes a Reconnaissance Data Annotation System that incorporates off-the-shelf technology and system designs providing a high degree of adaptability and interoperability to satisfy future reconnaissance data requirements. The history of data annotation for reconnaissance is reviewed in order to provide the base from which future developments can be assessed and technical risks minimized. The system described will accommodate new developments in recording head assemblies and the incorporation of advanced cameras of both the film and electro-optical type. Use of microprocessor control and digital bus inter-face form the central design philosophy. For long range, high altitude, standoff missions, the Data Annotation System computes the projected latitude and longitude of central target position from aircraft position and attitude. This complements the use of longer ranges and high altitudes for reconnaissance missions.\n\nLaser diode arrays for naval reconnaissance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolloway, John H., Jr.; Crosby, Frank J.; Petee, Danny A.; Suiter, Harold R.; Witherspoon, Ned H.\n\n2003-09-01\n\nThe Airborne Littoral Reconnaissance Technologies (ALRT) Project has demonstrated a nighttime operational minefield detection capability using commercial off-the-shelf high-power Laser Diode Arrays (LDAs). Historically, optical aerial detection of minefields has primarily been limited to daytime operations but LDAs promise compact and efficient lighting to allow for enhanced reconnaissance operations for future mine detection systems. When combined with high-resolution intensified imaging systems, LDAs can illuminate otherwise unseen areas. Future wavelength options will open the way for active multispectral imaging with LDAs. The Coastal Systems Station working for the Office of Naval Research on the ALRT project has designed, developed, integrated, and tested both prototype and commercial arrays from a Cessna airborne platform. Detailed test results show the ability to detect several targets of interest in a variety of background conditions. Initial testing of the prototype arrays, reported on last year, was completed and further investigations of the commercial versions were performed. Polarization-state detection studies were performed, and advantageous properties of the source-target-sensor geometry noted. Current project plans are to expand the field-of-view coverage for Naval exercises in the summer of 2003. This paper describes the test collection, data library products, array information, on-going test analysis results, and future planned testing of the LDAs.\n\nInflight Calibration of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Wide Angle Camera\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahanti, P.; Humm, D. C.; Robinson, M. S.; Boyd, A. K.; Stelling, R.; Sato, H.; Denevi, B. W.; Braden, S. E.; Bowman-Cisneros, E.; Brylow, S. M.; Tschimmel, M.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) has acquired more than 250,000 images of the illuminated lunar surface and over 190,000 observations of space and non-illuminated Moon since 1 January 2010. These images, along with images from the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) and other Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter instrument datasets are enabling new discoveries about the morphology, composition, and geologic/geochemical evolution of the Moon. Characterizing the inflight WAC system performance is crucial to scientific and exploration results. Pre-launch calibration of the WAC provided a baseline characterization that was critical for early targeting and analysis. Here we present an analysis of WAC performance from the inflight data. In the course of our analysis we compare and contrast with the pre-launch performance wherever possible and quantify the uncertainty related to various components of the calibration process. We document the absolute and relative radiometric calibration, point spread function, and scattered light sources and provide estimates of sources of uncertainty for spectral reflectance measurements of the Moon across a range of imaging conditions.\n\nAudio-magnetotelluric methods in reconnaissance geothermal exploration\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHoover, D.B.; Long, C.L.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nand 18 600 Hz where artificial VLF sources are available. As a reconnaissance technique we use AMT surveys in conjunction with regional gravity, magnetic, and telluric surveys. The exploration depth is a function of the resistivities of the lithologic section, but typically ranges from the surface to 0.2 km in low-resistivity areas and to greater than 2 km in high-resistivity regions. Results of the initial reconnaissance AMT surveys provide a rational basis for deciding on the extent of costlier follow-up surveys. As part of the U.S. Geological Survey geothermal program, surveys were conducted in Long Valley and Surprise Valley, California; the Vale, Ore-Weiser, Idaho region; and Bruneau-Grand View, Raft River, and Island Park regions of Idaho. AMT surveys in five additional known geothermal resource areas (KGRA's) have been scheduled for completion by May 1975. In the Raft River and Bruneau-Grand View regions and Long Valley, follow-up electrical surveys substantiated the effectiveness of the AMT technique for reconnaissance surveying.\n\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter Taking Shape\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2004-08-09\n\nLockheed Martin Space Systems engineer Terry Kampmann left and lead technician Jack Farmerie work on assembly and test of NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft bus in a cleanroom at the company Denver facility.\n\nMultiple Autonomous Vehicles for Minefield Reconnaissance and Mapping\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1997-12-01\n\nNPS-ME-97-008 NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL Monterey, California ItC A D- 19980421 131 =C QUALTY Ui Ji.CTEJ) THESIS MULTIPLE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES FOR...MULTIPLE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES FOR MINEFIELD 5.

A simple approach to collection and field analysis consists of a small-diameter probe pounded into the ground to a depth of at least 0.75 m. Analysis is by an alpha-scintillometer. Soil-gas samples collected along a traverse in Prince Georges County, Maryland, demonstrates the utility of the technique. The reconnaissance sampling revealed Rn soil-gas concentrations of up to 2500 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) indicating that the potential exists for indoor accumulations in excess of 4 pCi/L. -from Author\n\nAmplitude versus offset analysis to marine seismic data acquired in Nankai Trough, offshore Japan where methane hydrate exists\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHato, M.; Inamori, T.; Matsuoka, T.; Shimizu, S.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nOccurrence of methane hydrates in the Nankai Trough, located off the south-eastern coast of Japan, was confirmed by the exploratory test well drilling conducted by Japanâs Ministry of International Trade and Industry in 1999. Confirmation of methane hydrate has given so big impact to the Japan's future energy strategy and scientific and technological interest was derived from the information of the coring and logging results at the well. Following the above results, Japan National Oil Corporation (JNOC) launched the national project, named as MH21, for establishing the technology of methane hydrate exploration and related technologies such as production and development. As one of the research project for evaluating the total amount of the methane hydrate, Amplitude versus Offset (AVO) was applied to the seismic data acquired in the Nankai Trough area. The main purpose of the AVO application is to evaluate the validity of delineation of methane hydrate-bearing zones. Since methane hydrate is thought to accompany with free-gas in general just below the methane hydrate-bearing zones, the AVO has a possibility of describing the presence of free-gas. The free-gas is thought to be located just below the base of methane hydrate stability zone which is characterized by the Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs) on the seismic section. In this sense, AVO technology, which was developed as gas delineation tools, can be utilized for methane hydrate exploration. The result of AVO analysis clearly shows gas-related anomaly below the BSRs. Appearance of the AVO anomaly has so wide variety. Some of the anomalies might not correspond to the free-gas existence, however, some of them may show free-gas. We are now going to develop methodology to clearly discriminate free-gas from non-gas zone by integrating various types of seismic methods such as seismic inversion and seismic attribute analysis.\n\nInformation Management For Tactical Reconnaissance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWhite, James P.\n\n1984-12-01\n\nThe expected battlefield tactics of the 1980's and 1990's will be fluid and dynamic. If tactical reconnaissance is to meet this challenge, it must explore all ways of accelerating the flow of information through the reconnaissance cycle, from the moment a tasking request is received to the time the mission results are delivered to the requestor. In addition to near real-time dissemination of reconnaissance information, the mission planning phase needs to be more responsive to the rapidly changing battlefield scenario. By introducing Artificial Intelligence (AI) via an expert system to the mission planning phase, repetitive and computational tasks can be more readily performed by the ground-based mission planning system, thereby permitting the aircrew to devote more of their time to target study. Transporting the flight plan, plus other mission data, to the aircraft is simple with the Fairchild Data Transfer Equipment (DTE). Aircrews are relieved of the tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming task of manually keying-in avionics initialization data. Post-flight retrieval of mission data via the DTE will permit follow-on aircrews, just starting their mission planning phase, to capitalize on current threat data collected by the returning aircrew. Maintenance data retrieved from the recently flown mission will speed-up the aircraft turn-around by providing near-real time fault detection/isolation. As future avionics systems demand more information, a need for a computer-controlled, smart data base or expert system on-board the aircraft will emerge.\n\nTactical reconnaissance recorder alternatives\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKlang, Mark R.\n\n1997-11-01\n\nThe actual collection of data, such as digital imagery, using the multitude of sensors available today and in the near future, requires a high data rate digital recorder. The amount of memory, data rates, environmental factors and affordability are important issues when selecting the type of recording system. This paper will discuss two types of systems, tape and solid state. Emphasis will be placed on operational factors and specific mission profiles that are associated with a tactical reconnaissance mission. The current and projected costs of the digital tape recorder and soli state recorder will be examined. The logistics of moving the data from the aircraft to a Ground Exploitation System will be discussed. Once the data is collected it needs to be stored in non-volatile memory with easy access. One of the major problems encountered during Desert Storm was the inability to locate and retrieve reconnaissance images. A data base that can store terabytes of data and have the ability to recall this information from off-site locations should be a requirement for a Desert Storm scenario.\n\nReconnaissance invariante d'objets 3-D et correlation SONG\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoy, Sebastien\n\nCette these propose des solutions a deux problemes de la reconnaissance automatique de formes: la reconnaissance invariante d'objets tridimensionnels a partir d'images d'intensite et la reconnaissance robuste a la presence de bruit disjoint. Un systeme utilisant le balayage angulaire des images et un classificateur par trajectoires d'espace des caracteristiques permet d'obtenir la reconnaissance invariante d'objets tridimensionnels. La reconnaissance robuste a la presence de bruit disjoint est realisee au moyen de la correlation SONG. Nous avons realise la reconnaissance invariante aux translations, rotations et changements d'echelle d'objets tridimensionnels a partir d'images d'intensite segmentees. Nous utilisons le balayage angulaire et un classificateur a trajectoires d'espace des caracteris tiques. Afin d'obtenir l'invariance aux translations, le centre de balayage angulaire coincide avec le centre geometrique de l'image. Le balayage angulaire produit un vecteur de caracteristiques invariant aux changements d'echelle de l'image et il transforme en translations du signal les rotations autour d'un axe parallele a la ligne de visee. Le classificateur par trajectoires d'espace des caracteristiques represente une rotation autour d'un axe perpendiculaire a la ligne de visee par une courbe dans l'espace. La classification se fait par la mesure de la distance du vecteur de caracteristiques de l'image a reconnaitre aux trajectoires stockees dans l'espace.

Airborne multispectral scanning (MSS) data were obtained in May, 1972, over a region between Spearfish and Rapid City, South Dakota. With major effort directed toward the analysis of these data, the following geologic features were discriminated: (1) exposed rock areas, (2) five separate rock groups, (3) large-scale structures. This discrimination was accomplished by ratioing multispectral channels.\n\nImproving Air Force Imagery Reconnaissance Support to Ground Commanders.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1983-06-03\n\nreconnaissance support in Southeast Asia due to the long response times of film recovery and 26 processing capabilities and inadequate command and control...reconnaissance is an integral part of the C31 information explosion.

SET protein was analyzed in 372 HNSCC tissue samples by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray and HNSCC cell lineages. Oxidative stress was induced with the pro-oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (50 and 250Î¼M) in the HNSCC HN13 cell lineage either with (siSET) or without (siNC) SET knockdown. Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion and annexin V/propidium iodide assays. It was assessed caspase-3 and -9, PARP-1, DNA fragmentation, NM23-H1, SET, Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) status. Acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) were assessed by the acridine orange assay. Glutathione levels and transcripts of antioxidant genes were assayed by fluorometry and real time PCR, respectively. SET levels were up-regulated in 97% tumor tissue samples and in HNSCC cell lineages. SiSET in HN13 cells (i) promoted cell death but did not induced caspases, PARP-1 cleavage or DNA fragmentation, and (ii) decreased resistance to death induced by oxidative stress, indicating SET involvement through caspase-independent mechanism. The red fluorescence induced by siSET in HN13 cells in the acridine orange assay suggests SET-dependent prevention of AVOs acidification. NM23-H1 protein was restricted to the cytoplasm of siSET/siNC HN13 cells under oxidative stress, in association with decrease of cleaved SET levels. In the presence of oxidative stress, siNC HN13 cells showed lower GSH antioxidant defense (GSH/GSSG ratio) but higher expression of the antioxidant genes PRDX6, SOD2 and TXN compared to siSET HN13 cells. Still under oxidative stress, p-Akt levels were increased in siNC HN13 cells but not in siSET HN13, indicating its involvement in HN13 cell survival. Similar results for the main SET effects were observed in HN12 and CAL 27 cell lineages, except that HN13 cells were more\n\nMission Life Thermal Analysis and Environment Correlation for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGarrison, Matthew B.; Peabody, Hume\n\n2012-01-01\n\nStandard thermal analysis practices include stacking worst-case conditions including environmental heat loads, thermo-optical properties and orbital beta angles. This results in the design being driven by a few bounding thermal cases, although those cases may only represent a very small portion of the actual mission life. The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Thermal Branch developed a procedure to predict the flight temperatures over the entire mission life, assuming a known beta angle progression, variation in the thermal environment, and a degradation rate in the coatings. This was applied to the Global Precipitation Measurement core spacecraft. In order to assess the validity of this process, this work applies the similar process to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. A flight-correlated thermal model was exercised to give predictions of the thermal performance over the mission life. These results were then compared against flight data from the first two years of the spacecraft s use. This is used to validate the process and to suggest possible improvements for future analyses.\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) instrument overview\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRobinson, M.S.; Brylow, S.M.; Tschimmel, M.; Humm, D.; Lawrence, S.J.; Thomas, P.C.; Denevi, B.W.; Bowman-Cisneros, E.; Zerr, J.; Ravine, M.A.; Caplinger, M.A.; Ghaemi, F.T.; Schaffner, J.A.; Malin, M.C.; Mahanti, P.; Bartels, A.; Anderson, J.; Tran, T.N.; Eliason, E.M.; McEwen, A.S.; Turtle, E.; Jolliff, B.L.; Hiesinger, H.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and Narrow Angle Cameras (NACs) are on the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).

Examination of copper, silver, and molybdenum occurrences and of a reported nickel prospect in the Slana-Nabesna and Chisana districts in the eastern Alaska Range revealed a maximum radioactivity of about 0.003 percent equivalent uranium. No appreciable radioactivity anomolies were indicated by aerial and foot traverses in the area. Reconnaissance for possible lode concentrations of uranium minerals in the vicinity of reported fluoride occurrences in the Hope Creek and Miller House-Circle Hot Springs areas of the Circle quadrangle and in the Fortymile district found a maximum of 0.055 percent equivalent uranium in a float fragment of ferruginous breccia in the Hope Creek area; analysis of samples obtained in the vicinity of the other fluoride occurrences showed a maximum of only 0.005 percent equivalent uranium. No uraniferous loads were discovered in the Koyukuk-Chandalar region, nor was the source of the monazite, previously reported in the placer concentrates from the Chandalar mining district, located. The source of the uranotheorianite in the placers at Gold Bench on the South Fork of the Koyukuk River was not found during a brief reconaissance, but a placer concentrate was obtained that contains 0.18 percent equivalent uranium. This concentrate is about ten times more radioactive than concentrates previously available from the area.\n\nMilitary Transformation: Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2003-01-17\n\nhttp:// ww2 .pstripes.osd.mil/01/research1.html].

The results of these analyses were used to develop an aeroheating database to be used for the pre-flight planning and the in-flight operations support for the aerobraking phase of the MRO mission. The aeroheating predictions calculated for the MRO include the heat transfer coefficient (C(H)) over a range of angles-of-attack, side-slip angles, and number densities. The effects of flow chemistry were also investigated. Flight heat flux data deduced from surface temperature sensors have been compared to pre-flight predictions and agree favorably.\n\nSolid state recorders for airborne reconnaissance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKlang, Mark R.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nSolid state recorders have become the recorder of choice for meeting airborne ruggedized requirements for reconnaissance and flight test. The cost of solid state recorders have decreased over the past few years that they are now less expense than the traditional high speed tape recorders. CALCULEX, Inc manufactures solid state recorders called MONSSTR (Modular Non-volatile Solid State Recorder). MONSSTR is being used on many different platforms such as F/A-22, Global Hawk, F-14, F-15, F-16, U-2, RF-4, and Tornado. This paper will discuss the advantages of using solid state recorders to meet the airborne reconnaissance requirement and the ability to record instrumentation data. The CALCULEX recorder has the ability to record sensor data and flight test data in the same chassis. This is an important feature because it eliminates additional boxes on the aircraft. The major advantages to using a solid state recorder include; reliability, small size, light weight, and power. Solid state recorders also have a larger storage capacity and higher bandwidth capability than other recording devices.\n\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter: Aerobraking Science Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBougher, Stephen W.; Keating, G. M.\n\n2006-09-01\n\nThe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on August 12, 2005, and arrived at Mars on March 10, 2006. Aerobraking in the martian thermosphere was conducted for nearly 5-months after arrival, enabling the desired MRO mapping orbit to be achieved. The MRO aerobraking phase began in early martian northern Spring (Ls = 36) and continued through early northern Summer (Ls 110), spanning approximately 500 orbits. The MRO periapsis latitude migrated slowly poleward/southward from 70ÂºS latitude upon aerobraking initiation, passed over the South pole (near Ls = 77), and moved rapidly northward to equatorial latitudes at aerobraking conclusion. Upper atmosphere sampling ( 100-200 km) was achieved on the dayside (LT 1900-2000) before polar crossing, and on the nightside (LT = 0200-0300) thereafter. These seasonal and latitude conditions are similar to a subset of those experienced by MGS during its post hiatus aerobraking Phase 2. Derived mass densities, scale heights, and estimated temperatures are the primary data products generated from each aeropass. The most important discovery of MRO aerobraking concerns the sampling of the thermosphere up to 200 km, far higher than previous MGS and Odyssey Accelerometers have achieved. This sampling contributes to the characterization of the Mars exobase region, which is required to predict and interpret atmospheric escape rates. In addition, thermospheric densities at a constant altitude were observed to decrease toward the southern (winter) pole, as expected from previous MGS experience. No winter polar warming was typically observed near the South pole. Thereafter, densities were measured to increase on the nightside as periapsis moved toward the equator. In general, thermospheric variability was observed to increase in the vicinity of the polar vortex boundary ( 70-80ÂºS), and decreased again inside the vortex (high southern latitudes). Finally, longitude wave features\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Contamination Sensitivity Training\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRivera, Rachel\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe following packet is a contamination control training intended for personnel handling or coming to contact with Lunar Reconnaissance Or biter (LRO) flight hardware.

CRISM consists of three subassemblies, a gimbaled Optical Sensor Unit (OSU), a Data Processing Unit (DPU), and the Gimbal Motor Electronics (GME). CRISM's objectives are (1) to map the entire surface using a subset of bands to characterize crustal mineralogy, (2) to map the mineralogy of key areas at high spectral and spatial resolution, and (3) to measure spatial and seasonal variations in the atmosphere. These objectives are addressed using three major types of observations. In multispectral mapping mode, with the OSU pointed at planet nadir, data are collected at a subset of 72 wavelengths covering key mineralogic absorptions and binned to pixel footprints of 100 or 200 m/pixel. Nearly the entire planet can be mapped in this fashion. In targeted mode the OSU is scanned to remove most along-track motion, and a region of interest is mapped at full spatial and spectral resolution (15-19 m/pixel, 362-3920 nm at 6.55 nm/channel). Ten additional abbreviated, spatially binned images are taken before and after the main image, providing an emission phase function (EPF) of the site for atmospheric study and correction of surface spectra for atmospheric effects. In atmospheric mode, only the EPF is acquired. Global grids of the resulting lower data volume observations are taken repeatedly throughout the Martian year to measure seasonal variations in atmospheric properties. Raw, calibrated, and map-projected data are delivered to the community with a spectral library to aid in interpretation.\n\nModeling and performance assessment in QinetiQ of EO and IR airborne reconnaissance systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, John W.; Potter, Gary E.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nQinetiQ are the technical authority responsible for specifying the performance requirements for the procurement of airborne reconnaissance systems, on behalf of the UK MoD. They are also responsible for acceptance of delivered systems, overseeing and verifying the installed system performance as predicted and then assessed by the contractor. Measures of functional capability are central to these activities. The conduct of these activities utilises the broad technical insight and wide range of analysis tools and models available within QinetiQ. This paper focuses on the tools, methods and models that are applicable to systems based on EO and IR sensors. The tools, methods and models are described, and representative output for systems that QinetiQ has been responsible for is presented. The principle capability applicable to EO and IR airborne reconnaissance systems is the STAR (Simulation Tools for Airborne Reconnaissance) suite of models. STAR generates predictions of performance measures such as GRD (Ground Resolved Distance) and GIQE (General Image Quality) NIIRS (National Imagery Interpretation Rating Scales). It also generates images representing sensor output, using the scene generation software CAMEO-SIM and the imaging sensor model EMERALD. The simulated image 'quality' is fully correlated with the predicted non-imaging performance measures. STAR also generates image and table data that is compliant with STANAG 7023, which may be used to test ground station functionality.\n\nWhite Paper - A Study of the Maneuver Battalion Reconnaissance or Scout Platoon\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1989-09-18\n\nof buzzwords may have sufficed, but battalions, compan -s, arid platoons in the field suffered.

The information gathered is important for coordinated development in the area. Such development has been spurred by oil and gas discoveries on the North Slope, most notably at Prudhoe Bay. Little water resources information is currently available. The study area extended from the Colville River to the vicinity of Kotzebue. It included the western Arctic Slope and the western foothills of the Brooks Range. Nine springs, nine lakes and eleven rivers were sampled during the April 1976 reconnaissance trip. Its purpose was to locate winter flow and describe its quantity and quality. Field water-quality measurements made at these sites were: ice thickness, water depth, discharge (spring and streams), specific conductance, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity (bicarbonate, HOC3), and pH. A followup summer trip was made in August 1977 to determine flood characteristics of twenty selected streams. Bankfull and maximum evident flood-peak discharges were determined by measuring channel geometry and estimating channel roughness. Aquatic invertebrate samples were collected at springs and flood survey sites visited during both reconnaissance trips.

D.; Heckman, D.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nLower frequency telemetry bands are becoming more limited in bandwidth due to increased competition between flight projects and other entities. Higher frequency bands offer significantly more bandwidth and hence the prospect of much higher data rates. Future or prospective flight projects considering higher frequency bands such as Ka-band (32 GHz) for deep-space and K-band (26 GHz) for near-Earth telemetry links are interested in past flight experience with available received data at these frequencies. Given that there is increased degradation due to the atmosphere at these higher frequencies, there is an effort to retrieve flight data of received signal strength to analyze performance under a variety of factors. Such factors include elevation angle, season, and atmospheric conditions. This article reports on the analysis findings of over 10 million observations of received signal strength of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft collected between 2014 and 2017. We analyzed these data to characterize link performance over a wide range of weather conditions, season, and as a function of elevation angle. Based on this analysis, we have confirmed the safety of using a 3-dB margin for preflight planning purposes. These results suggest that a 3-dB margin with respect to adverse conditions will ensure a 98 to 99 percent data return under 95 percent weather conditions at 26 GHz (K-band), thus confirming expectations from link budget predictions. The results suggest that this margin should be applicable for all elevation angles above 10 deg. Thus, missions that have sufficient power for their desired data rates may opt to use 10 deg as their minimum elevation angle. Limitations of this study include climate variability and the fact that the observations require removal of hotbody noise in order to perform an adequate cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis, which is planned for a future comprehensive study. Flight projects may use other link margins\n\nAeroheating Analysis for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter with Comparison to Flight Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLiechty, Derek S.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe aeroheating environment of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has been analyzed using the direct simulation Monte Carlo and free-molecular techniques.

The measurements to implement this investigation include over 9500 targeted observations of surface features taken at spatial resolutions of better than 40 m/pixel, monitoring of seasonal variations in atmospheric aerosols and trace gases, and acquisition of a 200 m/pixel map covering over 55% of Mars in 72 selected wavelengths under conditions of relatively low atmospheric opacity. Key results from these data include recognition of a diversity of aqueous mineral-containing deposits, discovery of a widespread distribution of phyllosilicates in early to middle Noachian units, the first definitive detection of carbonates in bedrock, new constraints on the sequence of events that formed Hesperian-aged, sulfate-rich layered deposits, characterization of seasonal polar processes, and monitoring of the 2007 global dust event.
