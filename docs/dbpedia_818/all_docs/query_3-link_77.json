        "text": "The fifth instalment to the Pirates of the Caribbean series is at once familiar and comfortable, even if it’s all been done before.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean movies have long since crossed over into James Bond territory; they’re no longer about their heroes. What’s more important are the villains – who are usually dead, undead, or about to die – and the central MacGuffins. This time the villain is played by Javier Bardem and the MacGuffin is the legendary trident of Poseidon, and it’s a real doozy because unlike all the other MacGuffins, this one promises to undo the curses of the seven seas and restore life to normality, which, we are hoping, also includes scraping the barnacles off poor Orlando Bloom’s face.\n\nAs you may or may not recall, Will Turner (Bloom) suffered the dreaded barnacle curse at the hands of Davy Jones more than ten years ago, and as Dead Men Tell No Tales opens, his son Henry (Brenton Thwaites) vows to relieve him of it. To do that, of course, he will need the trident, which also means, by tradition of a Pirates of the Caribbean plot, he will have to team up with Jack Sparrow.\n\nSparrow is once again played by Johnny Depp and is once again a figure most intrusive. Depp plays him with so much flavour that the less we see of him, the better. But in Dead Men Sparrow is everywhere, usually severely unfunny and always in danger of derailing the film’s joys, of which there are surprisingly plenty.\n\nThis is a proper swashbuckling action adventure, with the kind of scale to make David Lean proud and the sort of thunderous, full-blooded musical score that elevated Star Wars (1977) to an art form. Sparrow and Depp aside, directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg have crafted here a movie about the seas that plays like a chapter from a children’s novel pumped full of adrenaline. Yes, the plot is essentially a beeline to the MacGuffin, the film borrows almost every joke and narrative element from its predecessors, and the bad guys are once again shot in front of a green screen and digitally animated to look like half-eaten zombies, but I was relieved to discover a story behind all the action; an honest attempt to make us care for the characters for once.\n\nHenry wants to return his dad to his former self, which brings out all the awws from the audience. Hector Barbossa (Rush) is back and despairs of ever finding true meaning in his life. Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), another new addition, dreams of finding the trident because it’s the quest her dad started and never got to finish, and Scodelario has some fun running about in her corseted dress as she makes all the men look like fools.\n\nDead Men is more entertaining than a fifth movie in an insufferable series has any right to be. There are visually splendid moments, such as when a mysterious island lights up with crystals to reflect the night sky. And there is a majesty about the film’s climactic showdown in which the ocean waters part like the Red Sea and the Black Pearl teeters precariously on the edge above.\n\nI cannot recommend you see this film for the plot or the jokes, but I suspect you will have a good time feeling its cheerful energy. I, for one, walked out humming the theme music with a smile. That’s gotta count for something.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is available in Australian cinemas from May 25\n\nImage courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\nAncient Egypt is once again delivered to screen by Hollywood, except this time no one will want to take credit.\n\n⭐ ½\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nGods of Egypt is surely a movie nobody really wanted to make. The result is a movie nobody will ever really want to see. This is a production, I am sure, that spent no time at all on a real film set, and thought it could get away with hammering in a stupid plot, driven by young actors who seem totally unsure of themselves. The movie stars Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Geoffrey Rush as the seniors, and Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton as juniors.\n\nCoster-Waldau plays the almighty Horus, one of the most worshipped and beloved of all Ancient Egyptian deities. At his coronation ceremony, his father Osiris (Bryan Brown) is betrayed and murdered by Set (Butler), Osiris’ brother, who is upset that he’s had to endure countless eons decorating sand dunes while Osiris decorates opulent temple walls in the adoration of thousands. Horus, of course, vows vengeance for his father, but is beaten by Set and cast out into the vast wilderness where, if the right person comes along, he may just be persuaded to return to Egypt to save the day and restore balance. That old, insufferable chestnut.\n\nYou’d think, since the Ancient Egyptian deities were all animals (or at least half man half animal), that it’d be odd to see them in complete human form, slightly oversized so that they tower over all the mortals, but you’d be wrong. It’s not odd. It’s comical. Especially when they look like King Leonidas and Jaime Lannister on a Greek vacation out in the desert sands.\n\nThis movie looks bad from just about every angle, and is written worse. It is coated in a thick, ungainly layer of CGI, so that some of the characters’ costumes seem to exist purely in an intangible, digital dimension. We are not even treated to consistent high quality stuff; the CGI drops in and out of acceptable visual standards. Some effects look amazing (as when a giant wormlike creature threatens to devour the Earth whole). Some look like leftovers from an After Effects tutorial.\n\nGods of Egypt is directed by Alex Proyas, whose masterful Dark City (1998) and sufficient I, Robot (2004) seem like timeless classics by comparison. Where is the attention to detail here? Where is the intellectual innovation and bravery that made I, Robot entertaining and Dark City such a threatening noir thriller? I fear Proyas filmed this movie with a horde of studio executives shovelling up behind him, inching him closer to the edge of a cliff. Only such hurry could explain this mess.\n\nI grew up reading about Ancient Egypt, and have in my adulthood come to fully appreciate their heritage and culture. I know my fair share about Horus and Set, and Osiris and Anubis, and can admit to holding their stories close to my heart. So you can imagine how tragic Gods of Egypt is, since it completely washes away all the charm and mystery of the civilisation, and replaces them with witless action that becomes very tiring to follow. Add to that the weak performance of Brenton Thwaites as the human Bek, and the absolutely befuddling Chadwick Boseman as the god Thoth, and you’ve got yourself a prime candidate for the year’s worst movie.\n\nGods of Egypt is available in Australian cinemas from February 25th\n\nImage (c) Entertainment One Films 2016\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nThere is no question that Australia is home to an army of talented actors and filmmakers, many of whom have enjoyed rousing success on local TV, and are slowly nudging their elbows into an ever-growing Australian film industry. But this country is hardly the place to be world-famous right now. At least not yet. The crowd isn’t big enough. The demand not cannibalistic enough. The creative and financial girths not flexible enough.\n\nThis might be why many of our local heroes find themselves shining instead in strange, exotic lands like the USA, where the film industry is so over-stuffed with Americans its solution is to build more blocks to accommodate foreigners. We’re not complaining. I personally think it’s wonderful to have exciting Australian talent wowing a global audience. The only problem is, most of this global audience have no idea they’re being wowed by Australians.\n\nSure, many of them have become household names – Hugh Jackman, Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, the Hemsworth boys, to name but a small portion – but more and more unknowns seem to be emigrating across the Pacific. My only concern is that to make it big over there, you have to be able to speak like one of them.\n\nThere is hardly any room abroad for Australians to break out their natural-born accents; I can’t bring to mind a single Jackman or Hemsworth performance that doesn’t have them barking about like untamed cowboys.\n\nSo, on this Australia Day, I’m turning my attention to five relatively small-time Aussie performers who’ve not only mastered the American accent, but are also exploiting its benefits to quietly climb out of the Australian manhole onto the doorstep of Hollywood. They know how to play the game.\n\nJason Clarke\n\n(Blue Heelers, The Great Gatsby, Zero Dark Thirty)\n\nAs with most Australian actors, Jason Clarke’s career developed from the meek success he found in sporadic television roles, including his multiple appearances as different characters in Blue Heelers, his role as Eddie Furlong in the medical drama All Saints, and his successful turn in the popular, innocuous soap opera, Home and Away.\n\nIn 2008, his face appeared before a wide American audience in the motor-killer bonanza, Death Race, which was so popular, in fact, it spawned two direct-to-video prequels. But no one knew who he was. At that point he was as famous as an apple in a supermarket.\n\nIn the last seven years he’s gone on to appear in several high-profile dramas, including Public Enemies (2009), Lawless (2012), Zero Dark Thirty (2012), The Great Gatsby (2013), and White House Down (2013), before achieving a more familiar fame with his respectable turn as Malcolm in 2014’s masterful political primate parable Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nHe had a busy 2015, starring in Terrence Malick’s disappointing Knight of Cups, the even more disappointing Child 44, the abysmal Terminator Genisys, and the spectacularly mediocre Everest. But quality does not rely on quantity, and with his effervescent charm, he can look forward to another stocked year, filled, one can hope, with movies better suited to his manner.\n\nEssie Davis\n\n(The Matrix, Girl With A Pearl Earring, Cloudstreet)\n\nSometimes all it takes to step out of the darkness is one role, and Essie Davis secured her claim to the light with her chilly exploration of a single mum battling not only the thankless task of raising an imaginative young boy, but also the deep domestic threat of a malicious spirit in 2014’s sleeper horror hit, The Babadook. It was a rather special performance, internalising a lot of the strife that came with the territory of such a peculiar situation.\n\nNow, she’s slated to appear in the latest season of the HBO fantasy series, Game of Thrones. Whether her fate in the show will carry her past a single episode remains to be seen, considering the show’s infamous propensity for stabbing, beheading, and otherwise inconveniencing its cast in ways unimaginable, usually at moments unexpected. No matter. It’s a well-earned step up for a much underappreciated actress.\n\nBen Mendelsohn\n\n(Animal Kingdom, The Place Beyond The Pines, Black Sea)\n\nIn much the same way that Jason Clarke achieved recognisable fame late in his acting career, so too does Ben Mendelsohn find himself settling in to Hollywood’s Champs-Élysées, aged 46.\n\nRemembered predominantly for his role as the venal John Daggett in Christopher Nolan’s epic Batman conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Mendelsohn has recently branched out in more creative directions, playing an inept criminal in Killing Them Softly (2012), a cunning effete landowner in Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014), and a furred up gang leader in the melancholy western, Slow West (2015), which I personally considered one of the best films of last year, and boasted Mendelsohn’s most subdued, nuanced performance to date.\n\nWhat’s coming up for him then? Nothing fancy. Just a modest role in a low-budget independent drama called Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which isn’t expected to draw in any kind of audience at all, except a small, clandestine bunch of renegades known affectionately as Star Wars fans. It’s hard to gain exposure with films like that, but my fingers are hopefully crossed.\n\nKodi Smit-McPhee\n\n(Romulus My Father, Let Me In, X-Men: Apocalypse)\n\nNothing does wonders for your acting career like starring as a down-trodden homeless boy in a threatening dystopian future, scavenging for food and protecting a life that has lost all meaning. 2009’s The Road put Adelaide-born Kodi Smit-McPhee on the map of up-and-coming stars and swung open all kinds of opportunistic doorways.\n\nThe role of his I admire the most came five years later with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, where he played Jason Clarke’s son and participated in the movie’s best moment: a quiet companionship with Maurice, the intellectual orangutan, poring over a novel that seemed to interest the ape more than the human.\n\nIt wasn’t till last year’s Slow West (alongside Ben Mendelsohn, another compatriot featured in this article) that he was cast out of the shadows and thrust into a semi-lead position, playing opposite Michael Fassbender as a love-stricken pilgrim, confident that the girl he met once and travelled the globe for will accept his marriage proposal. Now, with Hollywood firmly in his grasp, he’s about to enter the ubiquitous universe of superhero movies, playing the agile teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler in the upcoming X-Men: Apocalypse.\n\nRachael Taylor\n\n(Grey’s Anatomy, Red Dog, Jessica Jones)\n\nThe Tasmanian Rachael Taylor has yet to erupt. Like an eager volcano stifled with a giant plug, her career has simmered on medium-heat for a number of years, forcing her to take on roles both here and in America to keep the wheels turning and the fires burning.\n\nHer most memorable role, perhaps, was as Maggie in Michael Bay’s robot-fest, Transformers (2007), which was a decent enough movie on its own before its inevitable sequel afterbirth completely drove its merits into the ground. Now I’m afraid we’ll get more movies about Optimus Prime than we will about James Bond. Sadly, Taylor’s not scheduled to appear in any of them.\n\nJust last year, however, Taylor impressed with her stellar performance as Trish in Marvel’s somewhat unsurprisingly brilliant psychological superhero thriller series, Jessica Jones, which showcased her feminine tenacity and underlined her warmer, more affable nature. It was a great performance in a great television drama. She is sure to return for future seasons, and might even make the transition to Marvel’s cinematic universe. If that materialises, she’d certainly be dormant no longer.\n\nOther Australian actors gradually making waves overseas: Joel Edgerton, Melissa George, Ryan Kwanten, Isla Fisher, Abbie Cornish, Travis Fimmel, Emily Browning, Teresa Palmer, Brenton Thwaites… men and women of all ages – the list goes on!\n\nImages courtesy of Roadshow Films, Twentieth Century Fox, Transmission Films, Umbrella Entertainment, Anchor Bay Entertainment Australia and Nine Network Australia\n\nSon Of A Gun is a refreshing Australian film devoid of kangaroos, heightened accents and sweeping shots of the outback. On account of its killer performances and awesome action sequences, I would easily call it the best Australian film of 2014 so far.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\nIn the action/thriller Son of A Gun, 19-year-old JR (Brenton Thwaites) is forced to strike a deal with notorious criminal Brendan Lynch (Ewan McGregor) whilst serving a short term sentence at a maximum security prison in Western Australia. In exchange for protection from some unsavoury cellmates, JR must play a key role in a daring plan that will see Brendan and his comrades escape from the jail. Upon the successful execution of the break out, JR is inducted into Brendan’s crew, and an uncanny father/son relationship develops between the pair. Despite being in hiding, Brendan insists on attempting a dangerous, multimillion dollar heist at a gold mine in Kalgoorlie. When it all goes terribly wrong, JR quickly realises that it is every man for himself, and that absolutely no one can be trusted.\n\nAustralian films generally operate on fairly modest budgets, therefore we very rarely see an attempt on genres that rely heavily on special effects or epic action sequences. In the 1980s George Miller proved through his Mad Max franchise that Australia is more than capable of producing high quality action films for a fraction of the cost of the average Hollywood blockbuster, and now for the first time since then, writer/director Julius Avery has once again demonstrated this with Son Of A Gun.\n\nAt a question and answer session at Luna Cinemas in Leederville, Western Australia, Avery referenced the works of Michael Mann, in particular his 1995 film Heat, as his inspiration for the visual style of Son Of A Gun. These films are very similar in the sense that they both stay true to the conventions of the action/thriller genre, but they also include well developed characters, as well as an emotive storyline that underpins all of the action. Avery humbly admitted that he did not think his action sequences were quite as good as those in Heat, and as a fellow worshipper of this film I would have to agree with his admission, but nevertheless, Avery’s direction throughout Son Of A Gun is still pretty damn good. Particularly noteworthy is an insane car chase that takes place in the dusty plains of the mines in Kalgoorlie. The harsh sound design, coupled with the fast, brutal editing throughout this scene causes you to feel every bump in the road, and every violent collision between vehicles, as if you are right there with the characters. Avery said that whilst audiences are accustomed to the typical car chase sequence that manages to find its way into almost every action film, it was unlikely that they would have ever seen one against a background that is so unique to Western Australia; and he is 100% right. His exploitation of this location during this scene provides a truly original viewing experience.\n\nThe Queensland-born lead actor Brenton Thwaites has been popping up all over the place of late in films such as Oculus (2013), Maleficent (2014), and most recently The Giver (2014). You may remember him as the cocky, rebellious high school kid on Home And Away a few years back, but he has certainly come a long way since then. Kudos to Avery for casting Thwaites as JR as although the young actor is able to exude the tough and surly exterior of a teenage criminal, the moment he starts talking you realise he is just a naive and innocent kid, which perfectly sums up the character.\n\nEwan McGregor is scintillating on screen; he has this presence that demands your attention, to the point where he is almost a little too convincing. All of the performances from the supporting cast are top notch, especially that of Matt Nable, Jacek Koman, and a brief, but bizarre appearance from Damon Herriman. The only weak link is in JR’s love interest played by Alicia Vikander. She certainly gives it her all during an intense action sequence where she fights for her life, and for the most part she delivers a solid performance, however, in one scene where she helplessly witnesses JR attempt to fight his way out of a dangerous situation, her emotional reaction is incredibly superficial and very distracting.\n\nI am a huge fan of minimal dialogue, or at least only using dialogue when absolutely necessary, so in this respect I am in admiration of Avery’s screenplay. On the other hand, I felt as though there were a few clunky elements in the script, such as the overuse of chess references, and the collage of a perfect life that Thwaites’ character constantly carries around. There is also a not-so-subtle inclusion of a shot of regular teenage boys hanging out and riding their bikes when JR is in the middle of a crisis. Although I understand the reasoning behind the inclusion of each of these elements, I think they could have been handled with a little more grace, but these are only minor problems that I had with the film.\n\nWhat really sold the film to me was the unexpected, dark humour; the whole audience was cracking up during certain parts. I’m not sure how much of it was intentional, but this comedic relief was really effective. I’ve already said this on Twitter, but I will say it again; Son Of A Gun is definitely the best Australian film of 2014 so far, and consequently I am giving it 4 stars.\n\nImages courtesy of EntertainmentOne"
