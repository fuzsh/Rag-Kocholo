In the attack on PASSCHENDAELE RIDGE 30th Oct: 1917, Gnr AINGER was one of the two signallers who went forward with Lieut. Oliver, and stayed all night in the open to be ready for the action at dawn.

Altho the obstacles were apparently insurmountable he by his magnificent example and untiring energy kept all the men working at such a pitch that all six guns were in position for operation on Nov. 6th. In order to do this he had to remove the piece from oe of the carriages which was bogged to the axle cups under a heavy and continuous barrage and haul it into position.

A report on his commendation stated that during the heavy shelling, gunner Anderson understood the importance of restoring radio communication for a battlefield observation post. He returned to the (troop) carrier and listened to the wireless set which was passing on firing orders. Anderson received these orders and relayed them to the guns on his set to be filled out. This gave supporting fire and enabled the allied advance. Anderson’s presence of mind and bravery while under enemy fire was exemplary and directly contributed to the important success of this attack.\n\nCorporal Arthur Anderson MM\n\nFor gallant conduct near Thiepval on 3rd, Sept, 1916.

JULIEN their battery was under heavy shell fire during the time allotted for registration.

This N.C.O. was employed as a battery fitter. The Battery has had many guns knocked out by shell fire and put out of action on account of excessive firing. It is through the untiring attention paid day and night to these guns by this N.C.O. that the maximum number have been kept serviceable.

His services to the battery have been invaluable.\n\nSergeant James Ardern MM\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nSergeant Gerald Sarsfield Arkison MM\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nBombardier Leslie Armitage MM\n\nCircumstances for this award are yet to be discovered.\n\nSergeant William Frederick Armstrong MM\n\nAt about 10 a.m. on the morning of 6-5-17 one of our R.E. aeroplanes (No. 4586) photographic machines, was seen to land behind our gun position in FARBUS, evidently in distress. The enemy immediately started ranging on the plane, as it was in a very exposed position. Regardless of great personal safety Sgt. Armitage hastened to the spot where the plane had fallen, and found the pilot lying on the ground wounded and the observer badly shaken up. He dressed the former’s wounds and got them both clear of the plane and the shelling. Sgt. Armstrong then returned to the plane, which was still under shell fire, and succeeded in detaching the camera, which the observer afterwards stated contained valuable photographs of the enemy front line, and would have been destroyed but for Sgt. Armitage’s prompt action, as the enemy immediately succeeded in getting two direct hits on the plane.\n\nGunner Thomas (Tom) Armstrong MM\n\nFor gallantry and devotion to duty near Courcelette during the operations of October 21st, 1916. Owing to the number of casualties to linesman, this man maintained the line to the F.O.O. from the Battery unassisted.

Atkin had previously prepared the position for removal of these guns. When about half a mile from the position on the night in question Lieut. Cooper was killed by shell fire. Sgt. Atkin immediately took charge of the party, made disposition for the return of Lieut. Cooper’s body to D.A.C lines and proceeded with his detail to get out the guns. One gun was removed a short distance when the collapse of a wheel made further progress impossible. Sgt. Atkin then went back although intermittent shelling was going on all the time, and attempted to remove another gun and only after two sets of harness were broken trying to get it out of the gun pit was the attempt given up. Sgt. Atkin is one of the most efficient N.C.O’s in this Unit and the great courage and coolness displayed by him, set a splendid example to the men of his Sub-section.\n\nGunner Richard Roy Atkins MM\n\nOn the 14th April when on a gun crew in an isolated position, the enemy (during a bombardment) made a direct hit on the position, killing the N.C.O. in charge, and one other man, and fatally wounding a third.

During the attack by 25 Canadian Infantry Brigade on 3 October, 1951, LanceBombardier Dorman was charged with the responsibility of maintaining line communications between the forward observation officer with “B” Company, The Royal Canadian Regiment, and the battery commander at Battalion Tactical Headquarters. While “B” Company was advancing, Lance-Bombardier Dorman followed closely behind laying line as he went, in order that line communications could be established at the “B” Company objective before nightfall. When “B” Company encountered heavy opposition and the forward observation officer was wounded, Lance-Bombardier Dorman pressed forward and reached the “B” Company locality before the forward observation officer was evacuated. He crashed the artillery situation at once, and until relieved later by another forward observation officer, continued to act as liaison between the infantry company and his battery commander, correcting artillery fire and thus neutralizing the enemy.
