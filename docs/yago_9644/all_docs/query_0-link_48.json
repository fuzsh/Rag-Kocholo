        "text": "Welcome back horror-loving citizens of City of Geek!\n\nWe can’t believe it’s been 265 (266? 264? Freakin’ leap years) since Halloween 2019 and the end of last year’s 100 Days of Horror Challenge! Is it really time to do it all again?\n\nIT SURE IS! Buckle up, boneheads – it’s time to go for a ride.\n\nA ride of 100 new horror films for each participant! That includes YOU if you want!\n\nThis project is our own Kim Douthit’s long running challenge and the rest of us are joining her as we’ve done the last few years! The gist: watch 100 new-to-you Horror films between July 23rd and October 30th (leaving Halloween open for your favorites!) Parameters are loose – you want to include TV, go for it (Bob does, counting a season as one), watch a few favorites as Amy did last year, hop in as you can like Tony (he’s still in 2016 on this end!). Hell, Evan Peterson counts books! He’s a published author (buy his books!)\n\nThis page is the repository of what people post on the Facebook group for 100 Days of Horror. Whatever participants post over there, I’ll copy/paste here (unless you don’t want me to, let me know if you don’t). As posts can shift based upon comments and all that, this page creates a direct record. It goes newest to oldest, so many of the writer’s comments may reference something further below.\n\nI apologize for any weird formatting, the copy/pasting from Facebook doesn’t always translate to this awful block format WordPress moved to. I try to fix it as I can, but doesn’t always go. Thus, each entry may look different.\n\nCheck out last year here.\n\n**NOTE FROM SEPT 12TH until this note is gone.**- I, Bob have become very behind on updating from the Facebook to here. Working on it now! Might take a day or two to get fully there.\n\nSept 19 – Dasy 59 – 42 Days to Halloween\n\nBOB: PORNO (2020, Hoopla)\n\nYes, Hoopla. So you can watch porno through your library card! But I’m going to recommend you don’t. Our story: In 1992, 5 theatre employees find a hidden auditorium and storage room in the basement of their small theatre (2 working screens) after a naked vagrant breaks in. They find, among the ashes of the burned out storage room, a reel with some weird symbols on it. In a visual version of reading the Latin, they spool up the film. No surprise, it’s cursed, unleashing a busty succubus into the building.\n\nIt’s almost good, or even decent. Cursed film fucking with reality – good stuff; I like that stuff. Characters are alright, a little lightly written but could have been worse – while they are overly Christian, they were realistically so; not a Bible-thumping we see in many other films. Only the straight-edge projectionist is made for easily laughs.\n\nBut it DRAGS. At 98 minutes it’s very stretched. This is one where they characters KNOW they are in danger, but continually go off on side-quests, go into different rooms alone because they argued over something, or the like. There is SOME gore but not much – the blurbs I saw befor watching kept saying “gooey and gory horror-comedy!” I might have a different definition over gory. There is a bunch at the END but saying “grossly gory” to me indicates a higher amount.\n\nA rewrite and 25 minutes shorter, and we’d have something. This probably would b ea good short, but at 98 minutes I kept pausing to see how much longer we had. It was a LONG 98 minutes.\n\nSept 18 – Day 58 – 43 Days to Halloween\n\nBOB: HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS (2011, Tubi)\n\nFinally caught the 2011 “we gotta make this in 3 weeks to keep the rights” Hellraiser sequel. Now, I’ll admit – I mostly like the other DTV sequels. Not perfect, but there is something about them that land. This… this…. I’m convinced this is what Pinhead would show Clive Barker if he actually opened the box. Cheap cheap cheap. Filmed in what is likely a producer’s McMansion and what must be a set of shipping crates in his backyard he uses for less nefarious purposes than a crap Hellraiser sequel. Our story finds two asshole rich kids heading to Stereotype Mexico to be douches to everyone they meet. The get the box and open it, to meet really committed Pinhead cosplayer. Holy shit, this dude has no screen presence, no menace (I’m not a “not Doug Bradley so therefore sucks” guy, while no one will beat Bradley, but in a few days I’ll be talking about Judgement and that guy did a good job). He looks very uncomfortable, and his Pinhead make is just awful. (In a positive note, the special effects make up is pretty alright. Nothing wowing but at least they tried there). Douche bros go missing and we cut to their families trying to get over the missing boys. They bicker over secrets and blame and it turns out the mom of one of them has a tape of what happened and the Box. One of them opens it and Pinhead, and the boys show up – one as a cenobite that looks like a halfassed version of Pinhead (or a quarter assed as pinhead here is a half assed pinhead) and one whole but fucked up. The homeless guy who keeps the box in the real-world appears to do some murdering too as well. Sure why not?\n\nHellraiser Revelation is a cheap facsimile of a Hellrasier sequel, coming off as a slipshod amateur take on the franchise.\n\nJAMES: Driven 2020 (prime)\n\nI wanted to watch this because it had Richard Speight, Jr. in it as he was hunting down demons because of a family curse as he is being driven around by a cab driver who teams up with him. Most of the movie is in the car as they exchange banter back and forth throughout the movie and little demon action as it’s more of a comedy than horror. It’s still entertaining to watch the action in the cab than outside.\n\nSept 17 – Day 57 – 44 days to Halloween\n\nKIM: FROGS\n\nAnother one I have never seen all the way through. Thoughts upon finishing this.\n\n1. For a film called #Frogs there sure were a lot of other reptiles and amphibians.\n\n2. I fully support all of the action taken by all the animals in this film.\n\n3. Damn, Sam Elliott looks good at all ages.\n\nBOB:\n\nHat man: Documented Cases of Pure Evil (2020, Prime)\n\nGave this documentary a go as June and Wendy talk to the director in an episode of Mystic Moon Cafe podcast about a year ago – I know you’re both on here. I’m very behind! I promise to get caught up one day!\n\nAnyway, Hat Man is a documentary featuring stories of people giving their reports of the shadow entity many people see: a very tall mass of black, shaped like a person and wearing a hat with an obvious brim.\n\nAs an episode of a supernatural TV show, it would be almost solid stuff. It’s alright, but nothing all that special. I think I would have liked it more if it were shorter, but gotta make it feature length right?\n\nIt was well made with care put into the methods and recreations. I particularly loved the design of the ghost itself in those recreations, a good job was done to create an unearthly darkness and it didn’t come off cheesy.\n\nBut there are a variety of issues that keep Hat Man from working. First is in repetition. Not in the familiarity of the stories – that helps to show the same thing happening to various people to possibly give some sort of credence (though as is the case for documentaries like this, we’re speaking to the choir).But in the same people saying the same things. If I had to hear that same woman say “I think he’s Lucifer in the flesh” again… First two times it was repeated I thought I had clicked back to earlier by accident. But no, the same audio clip is used again.\n\nAnd many of the stories, while connecting to one other, and match my own read about/experienced by myself or trusted others encounters (I’ll put my story below), can be explained away with a few more questions. I honestly believe many of them were simple sleep paralysis – which is lampshaded a few times. Several others could be just tricks of the light (the photos presented for sure). And in sticking to a small selection of storytellers, we get an issue I’ve seen in investigations I’ve done and read of, reddit stories, podcasts (MMC and others) and similar documentaries – the longer you have attention on someone telling a story, the wilder it’ll get. I don’t believe anyone is activity trying to pull wool over another’s eyes (those people are usually pretty easy to spot) but “oh the light is still on.. Maybe this stretches to the topic..” and embellishment occurs. Especially notable when a few subjects say “between our last conversion and today I remembered [x] or [big thing] happened.” Giving that time allows practically begs “I need something bigger next time” in what should be a single day interview.\n\nFinal note: the font size on the on screen text was miniscule. Hard as hell to read.\n\nPS for a great, and freakin’ terrifying, documentary on sleep paralysis, check out The Nightmare.\n\nPPS My hat man story. Not my house, but an ex from 2004. The first time I walked into her house, major heebie-jeebies. Not knowing if she had interest in the supernatural, I didn’t say anything but it had that feel. We’re hanging out watching a movie, and I see clearly on the 2nd level a tall jetblack shadow with a top hat appearing and walk down the hall (is it a hall if one side is open to the first floor via balcony?). She noticed I reacted to something. Before I can say anything she said “tall figure in a top hat?” Yup. She’d see him often day and night, and would wake her up once a month or so (though I take most “I woke up to a ghost” stories with salt as could be sleep mixing with reality). There was also a room of the house I received VERY negative feelings from, she did as well. No reason, but then again I never went in there, but I couldn’t help but keep looking at it.\n\nROBIN: PUPPET MASTER 5 (1994) Ok, I actually really enjoyed this one. I loved how the protagonist interacts with the puppets and I still really like when they’re the good guys. So far I think this one is right up there at my second favorite after the original.\n\nJAMES: Infection 2019/2020 (prime)\n\nA father has to fight a hundreds of infected people across Venezuela and find his son in this fast running zombie movie. Nothing original, but it’s a good watch with decent looking infected people.\n\nSept 16 – Day 56 – 45 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: Honeymoon From Hell (The Legend of Alice Flagg)\n\nI don’t know why I keep watching Lifetime movies expecting them to be good. It’s my own fault really.\n\nBOB: DEMONS 2 (1986, Prime)\n\nYou know how hugely crazy-go-nuts the first Demons was when the sequel is half as crazy-go-nuts and it’s still wilder than most similar movies. I’m not throwing shade at Demons 2. I loved it. Just know it’s more restrained than a helicopter crashing through he roof of a theater filled with zombie-demons (be honest, the creates are zombies with a demon make up). Now set in a 10 story apartment building, the demon invasion is started when – because who needs Italian gonzo gore flicks to make sense- a demon from a movie pushes its way through a television set (someone saw Videodrome didn’t they?) and infects a young woman on her birthday. Chaos and bloodshed ensue as the demons try to kill a pregnant woman and her husband, a gym filled with oiled up strong men in banana-hammocks (led by the guy playing the Pimp in Demons!), a kid left alone, and a whole bunch of bloodbags ready for tearing into. It’s a crazy trip through anything goes filmmaking.\n\nROBIN: Mountaintop Motel Massacre (1983). This VHS cover is synonymous with browsing the video store for me. I can remember it sitting on the shelf in almost every horror section. The movie sadly isn’t that great, but I’m glad I finally watched it.\n\nJAMES:\n\nCircle 2015 (Netflix) I watched this with my sister today and it’s amazing how this movie reflects certain situations today. Messed up movie about how humans pick others to die. That’s all I’m going to say about that other than it’s a good movie but the ending was kinda now what.\n\nSept 15- Day 55- 46 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: The Bridge Curse\n\nWhere I did enjoy the mixture of found footage and traditional footage, this is a movie I have seen many many times before.\n\nBOB: GRIZZLY II: THE REVENGE (1983/2020; Screener)\n\nHow to property rate this? So Grizzly II was mostly shot in 1983 until Hungary took all the camera equipment for failure TO pay bills so much of the connective tissue and Grizzly parts of Grizzly II are missing – the animatronic didn’t quite work so barely (heh) shot before it shut down. In 1988 Cannon bought the rights to finish it but nothing went anywhere it was lost. A work print showed up in 2007, and this year a filmmaker said he “finished” the film. Maybe he did and added back in more, but the version I saw was the screener sent to Crypticon Filmfestival and it’s 1h13 min. A look around the internet shows a longer cut with a few more Louise Fletcher scenes is around with about 1h37. Maybe that’ll fix some of the connection issues – characters, especially the bear at the end, make big jumps of where they are and what has happened. Especially at the climax (sorry, spoilers I guess though we all know the bear attacking the giant concert in a national park will be the climax. BTW the basic plot is Fletcher wants to hold a massive concert in a US National Park but a 20 foot bear is killing people. Like the Mayor in jaws she won’t listen to the ranger and cares more for her upward mobility in hoping a Senator will like it). Bear attacks John Ryhs-Davies and others backstage, hero sees a “high voltage sign” and next shot is the bear all mixed into the backdrop bloody and dead. Someone asks Fletcher is it part of the show and she says “yes it is”. The end. How the bear moved 50 yards and got tangled in… we do’t see it.\n\nCan’t say it’s just 1983 footage, for like John Russo’s infamous 1998 cut of Night of the Living Dead, incongruous modern shots are mixed into the film. Oh boy do they not match. Clear drone HD shots of the forest, bad CG of a hunter shooting a confused bear, and weirdest of all – modern concert footage Strangely, editing cochella into Grizzly II KINDA matches, as the original footage seems to be several concerts edited together already. It’s both a hard rock (filmed a Nazatheth concert), new wave, and some random Hungarian rock bands. And one modern Hungarian band that really doesn’t fit. Weird to cut from an excited real rock concert crowd, to a for-the-movie confused Hungarian extras concert to Cochella.\n\nAnd yes I did say Louise Fletcher and John Ryhs-Davis further up there. THis is a nice cast for a cheapie filmed in the woods of Hungary in 1983. Can’t write it off as a vacation – I mean who chooses to go to Hungary during the Cold war? But those stars are there! Charlie Cyphers from Halloween I and II is on hand a s grizzled drunk hunter.More interesting is the just about to bloom stars: Debbie Forman gets the most amount of time as the daughter of our hero but George Clooney, Laura Dern, and Charlie Sheen are the opening (off-screen) kills! So strange to have the three of them around for 4 minutes!\n\nThat is a lot more words than I expected to write about Grizzly II. Even if completed and released in 1983, it wouldn’t be all that good. The bear when we do see it, is obviously standing in place with the same sound effects, the characters are annoying, and it’s just structurally unwell and badly filmed.Maybe seeing the full version will fix it, but I doubt it.\n\nROBIN: Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991). I swore I’d finished the series off last year, but a recent trivia question made me realize I’d missed this one. This is going to be a random thoughts posting:\n\n– Cameos galore! (Rosanne & Tom Arnold! Johnny Depp! Alice Cooper!)\n\n– Aww! Baby Breckin Meyer!\n\n– So. Many. References.\n\n– Ugh, the video game sequence.\n\n– This is like the Looney Toons of NOES movies.\n\n– The second half of the movie is MUCH better than the first half.\n\nI remember as a kid (I would have been 10), my sister went to see this in the theater and kept the pair of 3D glasses on her shelf until she moved out. I made her tell me how they killed Freddy.\n\nJAMES: LOST BAYOU (2019, Rental)\n\nMore drama than anything, a struggling addict visits her estranged faith healing father on his houseboat on the bayous of Louisiana to reconnect. There she agrees to help bury a woman, who he thinks is his dead wife in a wonderful, gloomy tale of love and grief.\n\nSept 14- Day 54 – 47 days to Halloween\n\nKIM: THE ISLAND OF LOST SOUL\n\nI spent the whole movie waiting for Marlon Brando to show up.\n\nBOB: THE HUNT (2020, Netflix Disc)\n\nThe third version of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME I’ve watched this year! (it was the first of them to come out though).\n\nSolid entry into the year – though honestly I wanted more of hunting in The Hunt. Even with unexpected (and welcome) diversions, it’s pretty straightforward in much of it. Not much of the cat-and-mouse I like in these flicks.\n\nI don’t know why the right was so upset about the movie – sure the liberal elite are hunting MAGAs, but the film is far kinder to the MAGAs. Kneejerk in their distain. Heck, the way the left is treated is just about parody with not much that rips on the right, to be honest.\n\nBetty Gilpin continues her awesome run of roles, killing it as our nearly silent, pragmatic and pissed-off lead.\n\nAnd fuck yes, that final fight (no details other than that!) is one of my recent favorites.\n\nLots of humor, lots of blood, and a killer go from Gilpin, The Hunt is good stuff.\n\nROBIN: TERROR TRAIN (1980) Another classic slasher that I’ve missed up until this point. Very effective! Man, that poor conductor. I will say that I completely missed that the magician is David Copperfield. I blame it on the lack of 80s mullet. Glad I finally caught this one!\n\nJOHN: Gates of Darkness 2019 (prime)\n\nI wanted to like this because of the cast but didn’t quite get there. Seemed to be missing something/plot and supposedly based on true events as a sister thinks her twin brother is possessed and asks the church for help only to unlock secrets from the past.\n\nSept 13 – Day 53 – 48 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: THE CRAZIES (1973)\n\nThis has been on my list forever. Enjoyable enough but I actually felt like it was a bit of a wasted opportunity. Given the current climate though, it still packed a punch.\n\nBOB: BEHIND YOU (2020, Hulu)\n\nA standard haunted mirror/Bloody Mary story. Two girls move into their aunt’s house after their mom dies; their dad is overseas and can’t be found. Another aunt died there as a kid, or vanished? The backstory is really muddled, along with the characters themselves. Actions, feelings, and reasons shift a good deal, along with the whys and hows.There is a knowledge shift to explain some of this but doesn’t feel right. Bad performances don’t help. Not really worth your time.\n\nJAMES: FANGED UP (2020, Prime)\n\nI wanted to watch this British horror/comedy because some of the actors in it and the premise of the prisoners in jail as food for vampire guards. It was stupidly funny at times and definitely had WTF moments. It’s not the best but it was entertaining and I’ve seen a lot worse.\n\nROBIN: CURTAINS (1983). I surprisingly liked this despite the mack truck sized plot holes. Was happy to see it streaming on Amazon even though the transfer isn’t good. I’m with every review I’ve ever seen for this… The mask is amazing!\n\nSept 12 – Day 52 – 49 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: NIGHTMARE CASTLE\n\nI was convinced I’d seen this, but apparently I had not. Solid watch. Worth it for Barbara Steele alone.\n\nBOB: C.H.U.D II: BUD THE CHUD (1989, Tubi)\n\nChud II is less a sequel to CHUD than it is a bad remake of Night of the Creeps.\n\nWhile I didn’t give the highest praise to CHUD, it is far and away better than CHUD II. Holy shit, is this a different movie. In tone, quality, make-up, and everything. Don’t expect to see anything resembling CHUD in CHUD II – like Troll to Troll 2. At least Gerrit Graham (BEEF! From Phantom of he Paradise and a zillion other things… character actors!) gets to mug it up as the titular character. He’s a soldier part of the CHUD project, an attempt to create zombie soldier as part of an inane poorly thought government plan headed up by a mortgage-payment-needed Robert Vaughn.\n\nIt’s infuriating how little care went into making this work. It’s just inane. Like take this: sometime late at night our “heroes” steal the frozen Bud from a “secret” government facility (very easily, to replace a body they lost from their high school science lab). They hide him in a bathrooms at one’s parents home. In the course of a minute, a pre-teen is told to go back to bed, the mom says she is ready to get in her bath and then the parents say it’s time for dinner. Three separate moments to create three separate moments of a joke not landing. No joke really lands at all. The humor, direction and performances are all lacking in energy. Just listlessly moves through\n\nIf perhaps the gore or make-up was bigger and better I could see past the bad everything else. But the make-up is merely a layer of community theatre sick make up with bad teeth. Only a few drops blood to be seen. Just go nuts- bring on the goo and bloodspray!\n\nBud the Chud is a bad hororor comedy that thinks it’s funnier than it is with low-energy everything and massively annoying inconsistencies (that I shouldn’t be mad about, they didn’t care, why should I).\n\nPS Okay the pool full of frozen zombies and the results are pretty cool, but too little too late\n\nPPS – there are no CHUDs like the one in first movie or in the poster. Very annoying. Nothing in the sewer either.\n\nJAMES: Alive (2020, Netflix)\n\nI don’t mind reading subtitles or you can change the language under settings but Alive is a fast paced Korean zombie movie. Some of the choices the main guy makes seem dumb but I still was rooting for him along with the girl across the way. Still an intense and entertaining movie.\n\nROBIN: WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE (2019)\n\nI’ve never read the book, but feel like I need to now. I enjoyed this one a lot. First thing I’ve seen with Crispin Glover in quite some time. Also, I can’t get over how much Taissa Farmiga looks like her sister. Solid group of actors playing the main roles.\n\nSept 11 – Day 51 – 50 Days to Halloween — HALFWAY THERE!\n\nKim: You Can’t Kill Stephen King\n\nI really wanted to like this. I tried. And it has some…moments…but overall just a disappointing. Felt too long even though it was only 82 minutes. Would have been better served as a short.\n\nBOB: JU-ON: ORIGINS (2020, 6 episode TV on Netflix)\n\nEh. It’s Ju-on, a series i’m meh on anyway (and I’ve seen them ALL). Some moments that work, but a whole lot of annoyingly inconsistent filler and scares. Somehow at 3 hours it’s the most amount of Ju-On but also does the absolute least. Expect the standard Ju-On stuff, except dont’ expect the scares and kill sequences – our familiar ghosts dont’ show up (outside maybe a moment).\n\nAll and all, I don’t really see the point in this entry. Weird to think the lackluster American one from January would be far better than a new Japanese one.\n\nROBIN: Amsterdamned (1988). Solid light slasher/detective story. I needed something simple & good and this fit the bill perfectly. I love that it even has a theme song over the closing credits.\n\nJAMES: Open 24 Hours 2018 (rental)\n\nA young woman recently released from prison gets a job at a 24 hour gas station on the advise of her parole officer. There she has hallucinations dealing with her past when she set her serial killer ex boyfriend on fire. As she deals with what’s real and not real, the suspense builds to a bloody, entertaining fight. Though the ending, I think could have been better.\n\nSept 10 -Day 50 – 51 Days to Halloween\n\nKim: Witch-Hunt (2017)\n\nI watched this on the recommendation of Jennifer Lovely and I very much enjoyed it! Very pleasant surprise! Also made me really want to play the card game they’re playing…\n\nBOB: AFTER MIDNIGHT (2020, Hoopa/Kanopy)\n\nA let down, bearing who is behind this flick. Early last decade Jeremy Gardner made the excellent THE BATTERY for $7000 and a hell of a lot of ingenuity. Now working with Aaron Moorehead & Justin Benson, the guys behind SPRING, and THE ENDLESS – who also get a hell of a lot out of a little, Gardner gives an often dull, overly talky and meandering look at depression and being stuck in a rut by way of an occasional monster. Monster movies are often metaphor, and I don’t mind long explorations of personal demons, but this didn’t click. I think Gardner had a couple ideas of where to take it and what is about but really couldn’t hone down before it came time to roll. It was time to go, and the nut wasn’t cracked, giving an uneven but well acted film. I didn’t dislike it, but didn’t really like either. Frustating as it feels there is a better movie just out of reach.\n\nBut holy shit, go watch THE BATTERY. it’s on Prime and Tubi and it’s astounding. (Thanks Jennifer Lovely for the many recs to see it). SPRING is on Shudder and Tubi and THE ENDLESS is on Netflix and Hoopla. See those.\n\nROBIN: BABYSITTER KILLER QUEEN (2020, NETFLIX)\n\nNot in the same league as the first one, sadly. One good thing… 110% more Chris Wylde. (I think I’m one of like 10 people who loved his show back in 2001). Sequels are hard to get right.\n\nJames: The Babysitter Killer Queen 2020 (Netflix)\n\nEverybody’s saying if you liked the first one, you’ll like the sequel. It did not disappoint. Two years later every one thinks Cole is crazy after the events of the first movie and he’s dealing with them and seeing a therapist. He’s goes to the lake with friends and then all hell breaks loose when the demon, blood cult comes back to life and back for his blood. Killer Queen is crazier, bloody, fun entertainment that will rock to the end with all the movie references and killer soundtrack. Hope you enjoy it like I did.\n\nSept 9 – Day 49 – 52 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: BLOOD CULT (1985)\n\nSo, weirdly the title of this movie also seems to be “Slasher” but most of what I found was under “Blood Cult.” It’s not good. It’s…remarkably bad…buuuuut it’s so bad it’s also kind of amazing? I sort of wish I had been live tweeting it.\n\nBOB: GRIZZLY (1976, Tubi)\n\nJaws. But with a bear. And stupid. Not completely a copy/paste plot points but pretty damned close. Close enough it’s obvious JAWS was the influence. JAWS rip-offs can be damned entertaining, but ORCA this ain’t. Our leads are interchangeable mountain dudes, the thing is filmed so damned ugly, and the the mixture of real bear (which exudes zero menace due to the filming angles they had to use for safety) and costume bits do not match at all. Holy shit, that last bit gets some decent entertainment with how awkward it looks.\n\nAnimal death CW: one bear cub off screen and one horse decapitation (which is so badly shot I laughed too hard at) on screen.\n\nROBIN: HELLMASTER (1992)\n\nI didn’t know this movie existed. I think that there’s good reason for that. Ugh. This was terrible. Wow\n\nJames: Forgotten\n\nSept 8 – Day 48 – 53 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: AMERICAN HAUNTING\n\nThis movie is an utter waste of some truly talented actors.\n\nBOB: I’M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS (2020, Netflix)\n\nI want to rave over how much I love this film, but I will not want to spoil a damned thing. I came in knowing zero and all the better for it. My letterboxd for 2020 releases currently has 120 titles, and this sits comfortably at 5. That’s how much I loved it. I’ll just say right now- a disturbing Lynchian nightmare with amazing performances including a career maker from Jesse Buckley. I loved her in Beast and Chernobyl (she was the pregnant wife of one of the first victims). Toni Collette and David Thewlis are on board too. That should be enough for anyone.\n\nWant more details (with minor set-up general idea spoilers)? Read on!\n\nJesse Buckley and Jesse Plemons (Breaking Bad, Game Night) are on the way to meet her parents. They’ve been dating seven weeks and she’s thinking of ending things. Thus begins a nightmare of meeting odd-parents and the sheer uncomfortably of a long road trip with someone you barely know, and jumping into a house and family with a long fractured history you know nothing about. It’s a weird situation to start with, but this is a Charlie Kauffmann movie – so there is FAR MORE going on that basic uncomfortably.\n\nWe have a film that also touches into emotional intertia and the sickness of memory.\n\nThere is a lot to discuss and unpack. It’s so well done that early thoughts of what things mean and reflect upon are not invalidated by later understandings. I’m getting dangerously close to spoilers so stopping myself right now.\n\nWatch it.\n\nROBIN: VFW (2019). If you like the old-school, gloomy siege movies, you’ll love this one. Super simple sets, great soundtrack, and some fun actors. My only complaint is the lighting. There are parts of this that are practically blurry with how low the light is.\n\nJames: Bone Breaker\n\nSept 7 – Day 47 – 54 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: Dark Light\n\nAnother meh in a sea of meh movies. I actually had to double check a few times that I hadn’t watched this already since it felt like so many other movies I had seen before…\n\nBOB: BUTT BOY (202, Prime)\n\nMeh It seemed like the filmmakers wanted to make a Greasy Strangler like flick, but somewhere along the way pulled back. Pulling back a bit is alright – I love GS but it’s a lot and not for everyone – but they pulled back too far, leaving a film with the potential for interesting incandescent oddness.\n\nAn alcoholic detective’s new AA sponsor might be the man responsible for a series of disappearances. Ok, he is. No surprise there. The vanishings are due to the sponsor’s need to shove items and people up his ass, which magically is an endless cavern.\n\nThe dialog, performances, and look are all highly stylized, well on the side of weird but not WEIRD. There are script issues in who we are supposed to identify with and root for, we start with following Butt Boy, but shift to the detective. There is a difference in telling this from a few POVs and both of them being protagonists against the other.\n\nBut it all comes down to a slightly bent police procedural where we know the culprit with the option of going wild but not doing so, landing in an odd place. No one is going to watch this without begging for the oddity of the situation so might as well just toss the normal away and commit. COMMIT TO YOUR WEIRDNESS. LET THE FREAK FLAG FLY. Half mast is worse than going too far.\n\nRobin: Porno (2019). Bleh. The first 3rd is all (bordering on parody) “Hey guys! This takes place in the 90s!”. The second 3rd is weirdly shame-y. And the last 3rd is a nonsensical mess (that is still pretty shame-y).\n\nJames: Dreamkatcher\n\nSept 6 – Day 46 – 55 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: Lyle\n\nI really enjoyed this. The acting across the board was strong but Gaby Hoffmann really carries it as Leah. Definitely has a modern Rosemary’s Baby vibe going on.\n\nBOB: WARRIOR NUN season 1 (2020, Netflix)\n\nA little stretch as Warrior Nun is more of an action drama than I expected, but there are demons, bloody deaths, and all of that.\n\nI love the premise – a sect of nuns trained in butt kicking protect the world from demons using parts of an angel’s armour; including the halo literally shoved in one’s back. The new bearer of the halo is a recently deceased 19 year old, who has been quadriplegic for 10 years and stuck in an orphanage bed so she’s not really experienced life: so she is torn between enjoying her new found freedom and the responsibilities thrust upon her.\n\nIt’s fine. Some good characters, a charming lead and impressive choreography go a long way.\n\nThe issue comes in the length. Like many other 8 to 10-episode series (such as the ones I watched last year Slasher, Chambers; or earlier this year Ares), the story gets overly stretched. Lots of narrative cul-de-sacs, my favorite characters get left behind early on, and way too much petty infighting and secret keeping for dramatic reveals.\n\nThis would have been a really solid 4 to 5 parter, maybe even a movie (though I think I’d feel there was more to explore if this was a flick). Another season is coming, and it has the feel of Under the Dome – chugging along well,, until word comes on high it’s not a limited series but a multi-season so gotta change gears and slow down to keep the plot moving.\n\nROBIN: Satanic Panic (2019, Shudder)\n\nThis is like the grown-up version of The Babysitter. Not in a bad way. This takes some of those themes and cranks them up another notch. I found it enjoyable. Extra kudos for taking what would have been a gross out scene and turning it into a super emotional one.\n\nJames: Cannibal Corpse Killers\n\nSept 5 – Day 45- 56 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: Girl on the Third Floor\n\nI kind of loathed this. The main guy was so unlikable that I just didn’t care.\n\nBOB: IN SEARCH OF DARKNESS (2020, Shudder)\n\nThis 4.5 documentary on 80s horror is both exhaustive but slight. Yeah, in this length that’s weird. So, like many documentaries of this sort – the filmmakers are preaching to the choir. Anyone watching this is going to be incredibly familiar with the myriads of movies and topics being talked about. But you know, we can’t get enough and it’s always nice to revisit thoughts on classics (that word is used lightly in a few cases) and occasional get some new insights. Many of these insights come surprisingly from Alex Winter of The Lost Boys and Bill and Ted! (Still need to see the 3rd one) There are a great many talking heads from all over the creators/stars of 80s horror and from the web. Most give good off-hand commentary, with the MAJOR exception of the James A. Janisse from Dead Meat. He’s reading from a rehearsed script and in such an annoying way, that feels often condescending and telling us exactly what we know already.\n\nI liked the set up – two types of segments: one picks out about a dozen features of the year and folks talking about and between those have direct topics: final girls, blood, sex, etc. Yeah, stuff we’ve read and seen before (likely with the same interviewees).\n\nSo it’s a mixed bag on that end. It wont’ be of interest to those who don’t care for 80s horror. The filmmakers obviously have a great love and appreciation but it also won’t be anything new.\n\nCompare to Horror Noire, which takes a particular aspect of the genre and really brings new views to it.\n\nJames: Don’t let them in (2020)\n\nRobin: LUZ(2018). I really liked the style of this one and the way the story was told. The whole second half in the conference room was just brilliant stylistically. However, the story itself left me wanting just a bit more. So close, but lacking a little bit.\n\nSept 4 – Day 44 – 57 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: THE SHED (2020, Shudder)\n\nI was fairly meh on this. I feel like it would have been a cool short but I got kind of bored with it.\n\nBOB: Into the Dark: Culture Shock (2019, Hulu)\n\nThat was a doozy! Whoo Barbara Crampton! A young pregnant woman in Mexico tries to make a second attempt to cross to USA and somehow ends up in a bright, cheery utopic America. We all know something is wrong. Fascinating look at the falseness of Americana with many great performances.\n\nJames: Light from light (2017)\n\nROBIN: The Cured (2017). I thought this one was excellent. What would happen if they found a cure for a zombie-like outbreak and those people needed to be reincorporated into society? I felt like it tackled the human element of it while also taking a slightly different angle on the infected themselves.\n\nSept 3 – Day 43 – 58 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: WHEN A STRANGER CALLS BACK\n\nI really enjoyed this! Actually better paced that the original (I love the original, but that middle section…) A little silly at times (the camouflage) but very entertaining!\n\nBOB: CHUD (1984, Prime)\n\nSurprising, a first time watch for me. This is not the Last Drive In version as Shudder doesn’t have access currently. CHUD isn’t a great movie, but it’s not a bad one either. I look forward to picking up and working through the Arrow Blu-Ray. CHUD’s cult film reputation is earned. But it is different than I expected from the cult rep. It’s a far more serious film than I thought it would be. I’m reminded of the late great Larry Cohen’s films – what sound like cheesy plots are presented with a true grit to them of real people with an odd situation. But not so odd it’s a mind-blower but odd enough that it’s a shrug and “oh, this again.” (Kim and I joked when we watched It’s Alive to open 2018’s 100 Days of Horror it seemed LA had a “mutant baby squad” on hand) Maybe too much talk and not enough blood,but good enough. Nice to see Daniel Stern in a serious role. And hey, early John Goodman for a scene as a pervy cop! I liked the monster design, and looking at the life of “mole people.”\n\nPS: Fantastic non-fiction book on the underground homeless of NYC: The Mole People by Jennifer Toth. I read it earlier this year and recommend it.\n\nROBIN: Death House (2017). I’m going to be pretty harsh on this movie. I remember all of the “Expendables of Horror” talk when this was in production. I knew it was going to be bad, but my god. I really wish, with the cast they had, that there had been a good script to work with. Sadly, it was a really, really terrible one. I’d love to see some behind the scenes footage on this to find out how the director got such lackluster performances from the actors. Barbara Crampton was one bright light in the dreck.\n\nP.s. I love how the quote from John Squires on the poster is, “Dubbed by fans as being ‘The Expendables of Horror'” Not even a direct quote of someone stating it. 🤣\n\nSept 2 – Day 42 – 59 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: All Light Will End\n\nI wanted to like this. I really did. But that acting was distractingly bad.\n\nBOB: Disney’s Z-O-M-B-I-E-S (2017, Disney+)\n\nThe spelled out title is on purpose, as replicates a cheerleader. Disney’s Zombies (originally on DisneyChannel as an original movie) is a mix of zombie movies (‘natch), Hairspray, and Bright (and a heavy dose of Romeo/Juliet). We have the plot of Hairspray, opposed minority is allowed access to be on an entertainment (football team) (with the addition of integrating schools allegory), becomes well loved, earns the love and respect of the popular person (here a cheerleader), and the dislike of pig-headed conservatives. Bright by way of the so incredibly obvious social messaging. I don’t need to explain the parallels. Like Bright, it comes off a bit cringe reducing still big issue (as we see in the news everyday) for fantasy like this; doubly so it also makes the message\n\nAs a movie, its’ alright. Charming enough DisneyChannel original. I don’t know if any of these kids are regular disneychannel stars (as often are in their movies), but they come off pretty well by avoiding the standard “setting up for a punchline” delivery. The songs are all the same peppy fun, enjoyable in the moment but not memorable. Oh yeah, this is a musical.\n\nPS The film has this green/pink color palette that made me wanna throw up. it’s ugly.\n\nRandom Acts of Violence (2019). Jay Baruchel has potential as a horror director, but he’s not quite there yet. I liked this heading in and for most of the runtime. However, it lost me as the climax began. I feel like there’s a pretty big casting misstep that takes the wind out of it’s sails.\n\nSept 1 – Day 41 – 60 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: GUNS AKIMBO (2020)\n\nAnother that’s a little bit of a stretch to count but I don’t care. Lots of flash and style. Not a lot of depth but Daniel Radcliffe is just so charming and watchable.\n\nBob: GRETEL & HANSEL (2020, Netflix disc)\n\nThis new version of the classic fairy tale starring Sophia Lillis (IT, Sharp Objects) and Alice Krige (Ghost Story, First Contact, so many other awesome things) has had many detractors from those who have seen it ( maybe even some of you). But I loved every last minute of its beautifully shot slow burn.\n\nBeautifully shot slow burn that angers most viewers can also be said of the previous films of director Ozgood Perkins (son of Anthony): I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House and BlackCoat’s Daughter (aka February). And I loved both of those too. Maybe I’m weird. (spoiler alert: yes I am).\n\nIt’s moody and brooding, having the feel of Terrance Mallick, David Lynch, a tad of Ken Russell, and heavy doses of Herzog – espcially is version of NOSFERATU. (still my favorite version of the tale)\n\nWonderful design and giallo-esque color use give a continually uneasy feel. The script is both obvious and subtle with it’s witchy womanhood.\n\nI’m sure everyone here has seen the similar THE WITCH, but if you like this sort of flick – I recommend HAGAZUSSA. Similar in tone, pace, and text.\n\nROBIN: The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue/Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (1974). I like the secondary title better as I don’t believe the movie ever actually makes it to Manchester. I enjoyed the different take on the zombies and how they came about & spread. That final climax was well done. Some great shots (elevator scene) in the hospital.\n\nAug 31 – Day 40 – 61 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: SEVEN IN HEAVEN\n\nAll I kept thinking while watching this was, ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer did it better with The Wish.’\n\nBOB: INTO THE DARK: THEY COME KNOCKING (2019, Hulu). Pretty okay entry into the series (Father’s Day is our holiday this time). A grieving dad and his two daughters travel to an isolated spot – where the dad and mom got engaged – to scatter her ashes. Unfortunately the area is home a set of Black Eyed Kids. The BEKs fuck with the heads, cause injuries and everyone fights.\n\nI don’t know really what else to say. I’ts competent? It has it’s moments. Not a bad watch but 3 days later, I’m struggling to recall details of the back half (I usually write these right after watching even if not posting yet)\n\nROBIN: GOD TOLD ME TO (1976)\n\nI officially need to work my way through Larry Cohen’s catalog now. I’ve enjoyed everything of his that I’ve seen so far! This went in a direction I was not quite expecting, but I was on board for it. Completely missed Andy Kaufman until I was reading IMDb afterwards.\n\nEVAN: TESIS (Spain, Alejandro Amenábar, 1996, Scarecrow Video): I love this. Has a distinct Giallo feel while significantly better than latter-day Argento or much of de Palma. Also, the director was a film student when he made it, and it’s way better than any student film I’ve ever seen. It’s a student film about film students (hey-o!) investigating violence in media. Of course, they stumble upon a snuff film which may or may not have been made by someone at their university. This student film is way, way better than many big budget, widely released American or Italian horror films. TW: women tortured, some on-screen gore, mostly left up to the imagination.\n\nAug 30 – Day 39 – 62 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: THE LIFECHANGER (2019)\n\nThis movie was a surprise. I had no expectations going in and am not usually huge on body horror but I really enjoyed it. Worth a watch.\n\nBob: GET DUKED, OR DIE TRYING! (2020, AMAZON PRIME)\n\nCome for the Eddie Izzard, stay for the hilarious comedy take on Most Dangerous Game, now over the Scottish Highlands with large doses of have-and-have-nots, youth expectations (literally and metaphorically of pushing kids into the world without any prep and getting upset when they can’t hack it), lots of humor, and a wild adventure. Three ne’er-do-well estate teens and one nerdy overachiever must spend two days hiking across the Highlands to earn an “award” -a laminated certificate on a route planned by Prince Phillip (the Duke of Edinburgh) in the 50s. Too bad this puts them into the sigtes of the Duke (Izzard) and Duchess, two upper class twits of the year with a large gun, a sword, and human skin masks. Thus begins a madcap adventure to survive, with the help of drugged up on rabbit poop farmers (led by James Cosmos of everything British ever) and accidentally hindered by two inept police officers who think they’ve stumbled upon a completely different plot. Continually funny and surprising, Get Duked is a movie new to prime I hadn’t even heard of until Tony’s review made me want to see it immediately. Glad I did.\n\nPS. The more serious Most Dangerous Game adaption that was on Quibi this year is very good too.\n\nROBIN: MADHOUSE (1974). The finale is definitely the best part of this one. The monologues and the dramatic revelations. Getting to that point the movie is fairly repetitive. I want to be Faye for Halloween.\n\nEVAN: BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (Russ Meyer, 1970, Scarecrow Video): Roger Ebert wrote this turkey. How dare he criticize anything, ever. This is not a sequel to VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, which was a failure to be serious. This is a spoof of the original and 60’s hippie/swingin culture in general. It’s a comedy most of the way through, with some dramatic scenes in which bad men beat the shit out of decent men. I include it as horror because the final act is based on the Manson Family murders of the Tate group, which had JUST HAPPENED when filming began, and Sharon Tate was in the original film. The final minutes are gory and suspenseful, but they also look like they were shot by Kenneth Anger trying to do Dario Argento. Oh, and the killer is trans. Eye roll.\n\nJAY: WINTER BEAST (1992, Youtube)\n\nOh my god.\n\nDo you love ultra low-budget creature features?\n\nAre you a fan of zany claymation FX and gore?\n\nCan you deal with sometimes excessively long dialogue stretches to get to utterly insane, hilarious, and impressively bad monsters?\n\nNever seen a movie with haunted, killer totem poles?\n\nBoy, have I got the film for you!\n\nThis is an absolutely wild one. If you’re at all a fan of low-budget, bad horror, I can’t recommend this enough.\n\nI was (pleasantly) blown away by how chees-ily bad the FX are and just how off-the-rails this whole film was. I want to own this film now lol…\n\nA really fun watch! Great stuff.\n\nAug 29 – Day 38 – 63 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: PHASE IV\n\nWhere the plot is a little lacking, I really dug all the shots from the ants perspective.\n\nBOB: THE POOL (2019, Shudder)\n\nWhen the Thailand-import to Shudder began, I as worried. In the first interaction we see of Day with the crocodile he’s stuck with at the bottom of a pool, the crocodile looks just awful and the compositing is cringe. (I’ll be honest, the croc never looks good, if that’s something that will bother you, this might not be for you). Then, we flash back six days. I was worried we’d now have a very long set up and minimal crocodile/survival action. Luckily I was wrong. This short interlude before Day is trapped a mere 7 minutes later in screen time does well to quickly set up the tools, traps, and handful of other persons to meet (along with setting him up as well of course).\n\nThe Pool is a fantastic example of its subgenre – a small amount of people stuck in an isolated area (the drained pool is in the blighted area and only filled for a music video Day was working as a PA on) against the elements and an animal with very sharp teeth. The expected things happen, progress is made along with mistakes and injuries as the resourceful hero tries to get out of his situation. I’m being coy on those details as it’s best to experience and figure out how they pieces will move by watching it. If you dig this subgenre, the pool comes with the highest recommendation.\n\nThe astounding 75 on metacritic (which I as unaware of going in, I clicked it because “new on Shudder” as the only qualification) is well-earned. You not find it listed on 2019’s full list as it’s only on 3 reviews but when ALL THREE give the same high go, that’s something.There is a very high volume of 1 and 2s on iMDB if you read those, most shit on it immediately for the CG or “why did he make [x] bad decision. I would have done [y]. STUPID!”\n\nPS There is animal trauma if that’s a trigger for you. (not just of the croc, but a dog is in peril too)\n\nRobin: GET DUKED (2020, Prime)\n\nThis movie was so much fun! Likeable characters and I laughed out loud at several moments. It is super light on the horror elements, but if you have Prime this one is a definite watch.\n\nEVAN: “NOVEL OF THE BLACK SEAL” & “NOVEL OF THE WHITE POWDER” (Arthur Machen, 1895, from THE THREE IMPOSTORS anthology): I need to read Machen’s THREE IMPOSTORS in its entirety. Both of these stories involve body horror, though they make us wait for the squish and slime and degradation of the human form. These two short stories are often anthologized with THE GREAT GOD PAN, which is of course Machen’s masterpiece. Reading the two “NOVEL OF” stories, it’s clear where Lovecraft got a lot of his inspiration for stories like “THE DUNWICH HORROR” and “COOL AIR.” Machen, in turn, clearly stole unapologetically from Stephenson, as both of these stories involve memorable tropes (including an atavistic drug and an epilogue in the form of confessions) that Stephenson had used in THE STRANGE CASE OF DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MISTER HYDE only a few years earlier. I love finding that chain of inspiration (and outright theft) as we put these movies and stories in close proximity.\n\nJAY:\n\nUncle Sam (1996, Tubi)\n\nThis looked like it would be one of those horribly bad, but hilarious movies in the same vein as Jack Frost.\n\nIt was not.\n\nNothing happens for the first 42 minutes. Literally just a kid obsessing over the military.\n\nPretty lifeless plot, dialogue, and film overall.\n\nThere’s a good chunk of kills crammed into the last portion of the film that were fairly creative, so there’s that.\n\nAug 28 – Day 37 – 64 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: INVISIBLE GHOST\n\nOther than the fact “Invisible Ghost” is sort of a silly name, this was a solid film. Bella Lugosi gives a strong performance.\n\nBOB SHE DIES TOMORROW (2020, Amazon)\n\nDull, pretentious claptrap. A young woman has a vision she’s going to die and this starts a contagious feeling of the same, leading to long conversations about mortality and such that feel like they are torn from a script from a Philosophy-FilmStudies-Stoner triple major instead of underappreciated actress Amy Siemitz (she writes and directs but does not appear). I get it’s a metaphor for suicidal depression and how it affects those around you but yeah… drones on into nothing. I will admit, perhaps the first person we follow is played by Kate Lyn Sheil was also in the overy pretentius Kate Plays Christine and I hated her peformance in both of these. is it weird to say her acting is both overfly forceful in underdoing it? Like aiming at no emotion and the deadest eyes. Anyway, this didn’t catch me at all.\n\nROBIN: Beast No More (2019).\n\nI was drawn in by the poster and let down terribly by the movie. Don’t bother.\n\nEVAN: Phantom of the Paradise (De Palma, 1974, Scarecrow Video):\n\nI stand corrected. I saw this one fifteen years ago, and I think I expected something very different. I wasn’t ready at the time for the zaniness, even though I was a die hard ROCKY HORROR fanatic. Anyway: this is great. High camp, but with definite Gothic and Satanic tropes. It throws glam rock, Phantom of the Opera, The Picture of Dorian Gray, and lots of FAUST into a blender with a bunch of other shit (birds everywhere, birds birds birds), and out comes this absolute gem of a camp musical spectacle.\n\nJAY:\n\nBody Melt (1993, Youtube)\n\nSo melt movies are my absolute favorite horror subgenre. Unfortunately, there just aren’t many of them (2, 3? I’m open to recommendations if you know any). Street Trash is obviously king.\n\nBody Melt was cool, though. A notable “Science gone wrong” horror entry that’s definitely worth a watch. There were a few glorious melts, but it also felt like a creature affair at the same time, which was weird. Does the drug make people melt, or creature? I dunno.\n\nSome of the story seemed irrelevant or misplaced, and it seems to be approached from a comedic angle, which was also kind of weird. If you watch it, you’ll see what I mean.\n\nPretty decent movie overall. I enjoyed it.\n\nAug 27 – Day 36 – 65 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: VAMPS\n\nWhen I first saw the full cast I was like, how was this never on my radar?\n\nThen I watched it. It had its moments. Very silly and campy. Ultimately forgettable.\n\nBOB: SCOOBY-DOO THE MYSTERY BEGINS (2009)\n\nIt may be unfair to hardly judge a cheap made for dvd Scooby movie after the underwhelming but budget-backed pair from 2002 and 2004. But I am anyway. Scooby-Doo The Mystery Begins in costume, character, and presentation feels like it’s just about to break out in the porn version. These are bad imitations of the previous movie’s voices and characterizations. Except Fred. He’s just some rando jock. He’s not even blonde with no ascot! Okay fine Velma is pretty good – less annoying than the higher voice Linda Cardellini did, but the annoying Lillard-Shaggy impersonation for Shaggy is grating. The mystery is lacking and energy-less, and a mess. Scooby is obviously less of a CG creation without the budget, but he’s barely in it. (but IS voiced by Frank Welker so that’s great). The whole thing is just… awkward. ON the plus side, there are actual ghosts. Always welcome for Scooby-Doo to bring in the supernatural and not just a white guy in a mask (we have that too)\n\nJAMES: Deep Blue Seas 3 (2020)\n\nROBIN: THE SHED (2019)\n\nThis one was fun. There’s not a whole lot new here but I enjoyed what they did with it except for one moment. Also, Frank Whaley still looks pretty good for almost 60.\n\nJAY: Galaxy of Terror (1981, I think I watched this on Dailymotion?)\n\nAfter Evan’s review, I had to check this one out. It is every bit as crazy as I was hoping, and then some!\n\nI feel like this easily could’ve been a precursor to Event Horizon, and equally gory (for its time), but with more creature madness going on.\n\nThis movie is hella fun if you’re into goofy 80’s sci-fi and creature features with tons of gore and mindf**ks. Which, I am, so this was right up my alley. I liked their light up backpacks too; pretty neat.\n\nAug 26 – Day 35 – 66 days to Halloween\n\nKim: INCARNATE\n\nIt takes a lot of talent to make a movie with this much plot be so very dull.\n\nBOB: DEAD BY DAWN (2020, Prime)\n\nUgh. No. Fuck this. Utter trash. This is a film that hates women. Our lead is Lulu, She’s a weak woman who does everything her abusive boyfriend demands. When he punches her on Halloween, she cries a minute then leaves to go her Uncle’s party. (later, the boyfriend shows up to help her and she just about runs back to him without hesitation). The rideshare driver is a skuzzy man dressed as a clown who leers and hits on her while pulling his dick. With a cut to later, she shows up, beaten and bloody, to a man’s cabin asking for protection from three people outside. These people are her uncle, who didn’t have a party – he kidnapped and raped her – and his friends – the driver and his girlfriend, who gets off on being beaten and abused. Her name is literally Snack, as in “she’s a snack”.\n\nThus starts the bulk of the movie. A horrendous home-invasion film. Even without the awful characters- there is difference in writing someone who needs to find strength and the way Lulu is written, its all very alpha male-ish writing (at one point the guy helping her rags on her for being a vegetarian and the writing sounds like author’s mouthpiece)- everything is just poorly constructed. The blocking, the camera shots, the make up. It’s all just amateur as hell. Cut with a chainsaw. That make up – looks like what and 8th grader would do in his dad’s basement haunted house with make up he bought cheap from spirit’s clearance sale the year before. Like results from a cut is a horizon line from obviously pushing fake blood from a gel tube.\n\nPS – yes, all the men are awful in this too, but the treatment of the women is a sorer notion. … I’m sure the bad performances make it all worse.\n\nPPS – this is also the type of film that thinks the audience is going to cheer a bad guy getting anally raped by a gun.\n\nJAMES: Cellar Dweller (1988)\n\nROBIN: PUPPET MASTER 4 (1993)\n\nThe series watch continues! I have to say, this one gets a giant yawn from me. I feel like nothing really happened. It was nice seeing the puppets being the good guys, but other than that… Hey, at least they retconned Puppet Master II!\n\nEVAN: GALAXY OF TERROR (1981, Bruce Clark + Roger Corman, Prime):\n\nOh, 80’s sci fi horror. Putting rectums in all the alien architecture (see also LIFEFORCE and ALIEN). The prologue for this one is insane–think ZARDOZ spliced with THE VISITOR. From there, we get a fun and squicky knock off of ALIEN, with a cast that boasts Sid Haig, Ray Walston, and Robert Englund (who, when playing a good guy, is quite a looker! Those eyes!). Anyway, a bunch of white people go to a stress planet and get stressed out and chopped up and pulped and raped by giant maggots. And maybe God makes a few cameos, but I’m not sure. And the ending absolutely got ripped off for ANNIHILATION.\n\nJAY: Disgusting Spaceworms Eat Everyone! (1988, Youtube)\n\nJesus christ, this is the most silly goose thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I totally agree with the description; it’s like some college friends got wasted and tried to make the silliest movie possible.\n\nAnd I mean that in the best way…\n\nSpaceworms is absolutely wild; from the (cheaply executed) “Slugs”-ish flesh-eating kills, to cocaine loving spaceworms, to the Michael Jackson outfitted Detective and his corny noire dialogues, to action packed shootouts, the worm zombie meltdown, ass-less pants, toy model spaceships, and the most ridiculously hilarious 15 minute finale that had me just about dying from laughter.\n\nThis is just insane all around, and a supremely low-budget shitshow.\n\nIf you ever wanted to get inebriated and watch the silliest movie of all time, this is the one!\n\nOr if you just need a palate cleanser that’s uniquely as bad as it is entertaining – don’t sleep on Spaceworms.\n\nIt doesn’t even have release art for me to post, if that’s any indication of what kind of cheap hijinks you’re in for here.\n\nAug 25 – Day 34 – 67 Days to Halloween\n\nKim PREY /Prooi/Uncaged\n\nThe film of many names. Predictable but solid killer lion film. I always root for the animals in these so the endings often leave me disappointed.\n\nBOB: WE SUMMON THE DARKNESS (2020, Netflix)\n\nI’d be willing to bet We Summon The Darkness is written around the story shift/twist/revelation. Got the idea, now write how we get there and figure out what happens from it. The getting to is better than the way down.\n\nSo the first 45 minutes are great, with character, interest and potential. Unfortunately the back half, while entertaining, is filled with many stumbles. None make the movie fall on its face but threatens to do so.\n\nBut at least it’s very bloody, has grievous bodily harm presented upon every cast member (an aspect I tend to enjoy), and deliriously demented over the top performances by Alexandria Daddario and Maddie Hasson really drive the film. (Nice to see Johnny Knoxville too, strange he’s the least energetic person in the film)\n\nA very uneven film, but still positive on the whole.\n\nPS it takes place in 1988 but boy does it not feel or look like it. A few props are made to look like the time, but when a modern vacuum is in the background for a good 10 minutes of the film it takes ya out.\n\nCODY: WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOUR DAUGHTERS (1974)\n\nSolid flick with a good plot. Nothing truly spectacular or mesmerizing like some Giallo but definitely worth a watch if in the mood for a mystery mixed with some good ol fashioned 70’s exploration\n\nJAMES: Catacombs (1988)\n\nROBIN: DEMON SEED (1977)\n\nAh, super computing and the Google Home of the 1970s! There were some interesting concepts, but overall it fell flat for me. My general dislike made a lot more sense when I found out it was based on a Dean Koontz story (not a fan of his style).\n\nJAY: DEVIL’S CANDY (2015, Youtube, Hulu)\n\nIntense!!! That is the best adjective I can think of to describe this movie. Just… INTENSE.\n\nJesus.\n\nThis film was incredibly well done; the acting, the cinematography, the development, the whole thing. Full throttle all the way through, and really had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It’s suspenseful, terrifying, and brooding all at the same time.\n\nStrongly recommend adding this one to your lists if you haven’t seen it already. This is a really good one!\n\nEVAN: Phantasm: OblIVion and Phantasm: Ravager (Shudder, Coscarelli): I love that these are a single storyline with the same actors. That is brilliant. Otherwise, oh well. I adore part 1, part two left me cold, part three reinvigorated my interest in the series. Four and Five disappointed me again. There are some fun moments: his eyes are sentinel spheres! Her breasts are–sentinel spheres! I turned off Ravager after a half hour. Anyone want to talk me into finishing it?\n\nAug 24 – Day 33 – 68 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: Random Acts of Violence\n\nI have to say I was thoroughly entertained my this. Fast moving, bloody and (though a bit heavy handed) I appreciated the commentary on the glamorization of serial killers. There was also some pretty heavy giallo style being rocked in the lighting.\n\nBOB: MADMAN (1981, Shudder)\n\nBog standard camp slasher. Nothing really makes it stand out besides one of the few screen appearances of Gaylen Ross. That’s not say I didn’t like it, but as I noted in the Hell Night (also 1981, big year for the subgenre with this, F13p2, Hell Night, Halloween II, My Bloody Valentine, The Burning etc) I automatically like slashers. It’s gotta be especially bad to turn for me.\n\nWhile the make up is pretty bad, the kills have a certain meanness to them, among the many decapitations. Perhaps it’s the look of the killer, but I had a proto-Hatchet feel to them. Of course far less bloody than that series.\n\nEric, was that you playing Max? His cadence and voice reminded me of you, and his face looked like he could be your cousin.\n\nBut that Vingegar Syndrome print they used looked beautiful (there were some pink lines at points but one thing I love about VS is how much love they give to their transfers of forgotten and crap films)\n\nCody: BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR (1989)\n\nNot as good as the original but still a fun watch and relatively good follow up to the original. Combs, Abbott and Gale all return to their iconic rolls and while this one leans much more into comedy it still manages to get a solid creep factor.\n\nJAMES: The Thing from Another World (1951)\n\nROBIN: Crawl (2019). I had fun with this one, but way too many of the good scenes were given away in the trailer. The initial appearance of the gators got me though! It’s nice having a creature movie where it’s not just a single badass beastie or a pair.\n\nJAY: The Urge to Kill / Attack of the Killer Computer (1989, YouTube)\n\nThis sounds a lot more fun than it is. Since I wouldn’t recommend watching it, I’ll just give y’all the layout:\n\nWealthy record producer engages in soft core 80s Cinemax porn for 45 mins. Oh, and he has a home security (?) and automation system on a computer (I guess, you never see it) that makes 50s sci-fi boops & beeps, then gains sentience as a topless, green body painted lady Gaga.\n\nSounds wild, right?\n\nUnfortunately it’s 45 min of soft core. There are 3-4 uniquely bad and amusing kills. Then a 10 min flashback to all the softcore porn scenes again.\n\nThen, for some reason, lingerie cat girls wrestling.\n\nThen finale.\n\nOh, and it’s 80 minutes.\n\nSo the bulk of it is 80s softcore porn.\n\nWhich sucks cause the bad kills and awful acting are hilarious and this plot was promising for what could’ve been an epically entertaining bad movie.\n\nEVAN: TAMMY AND THE T-REX (1994, Shudder): this is a very Troma kind of film. Rather astounding that Denise Richards and Paul Walker both went on to big careers after they made this one. Also, her name is clearly Tammy, but it’s spelled Tanny in all the credits, beginning and end. So there’s that. Also she fucks the Trex but not on camera, and Paul Walker looks like he’s all of 16.\n\nAug 23 – Day 32 – 69 Day to Halloween\n\nKim: THE DARK (2005)\n\nI have seen some variation on this movie a dozen times. There is nothing new or original in it. Buuuut. It has Sean Bean. So. It’s cool.\n\nBob: 1BR (2020, Netlfix)\n\nThat was not the movie I expected! Not a bad thing at all. A tight flick that kept me guessing of where we were going.\n\nAs much as I really liked 1BR, there is some element missing, there is a slightness or a just too quickness about it that doesn’t make it stick.\n\nStill good stuff and not pushing anyone away.\n\nThe Basics: a young woman fresh in LA rents an apartment in a complex and everyone is just a little… off putting.Then it gets weird.\n\nCODY: Martin(1977)\n\nA truly unique Vampire flick with a true sense of grittiness to it. Martin is definitely one of the most interesting flicks I’ve watched so far and definitely worth a watch. John Amplas provides an incredible performance in the lead role that deserves applause.\n\nJAMES: Raw Courage (1984)\n\nROBIN: Dave Made a Maze (2017). This has been on my to-watch list since it came out. So freakin’ creative. I loved the set designs and the concepts they came up with. Now I want to build the minotaur mask to hang on my wall.\n\nJay: BAG BOY LOVER BOY (2014, Prime)\n\nThank you to whoever recommended this (I’m sorry, I forgot). This movie was amazing!\n\nVery unsettling, uncomfortable, and then it just goes completely off the rails. Hilarious, disturbing, and repulsive all at once. The main character comes off incredibly daft and slow, yet seemingly calculated and perverse at the same time.\n\nDefinitely an example of morbid and disturbing bizarr-ity in the same vein as Greasy Strangler, but a little more focused on the plot instead of just nonstop weirdness (although, there is plenty of that).\n\nAug 22nd – Day 31 – 70 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: Puen Tee Raluek (The Promise, 2017)\n\nThere were some things about this I really enjoyed but also, the whole revenge motivation just felt wrong. I had a hard time believing the ghost was that big of a dick. But acting was top notch and though the plot wasn’t original l still enjoyed the film.\n\nBOB: THE WRETCHED (2020, Hulu)\n\nThanks to no wide releases and drive-ins, The Wretched was the #1 movie for 5 weeks this year! Quite a feat for a solid little indie horror film.\n\nOne of my favorite episodes of The Twilight Zone is the one where the returning pilots from a flight start to vanish with no one remembering them. Take that, Rear Window, Disturbia, a witch movie, a possession movie and push together you get The Wretched. Despite all those tossed into one flick, it’s rather good. A good build of figuring what’s going on, characters well played, and some good doses of practical effects, and often effective for the horror!\n\nA little retooling -up the goo, and a little sleeze- and it could have been a 1987 darling.\n\nOur basic run down: angsty teen goes to live with his dad during the summer of his parents separation. Kids start to vanish with only the teen seemingly to remember and his suspicion falls on the neighbor woman as she’s had a sudden shift of personality. He’s already on edge so no one believes him (and why should they?). It’s good stuff, it’s on Hulu and it’s worth your time.\n\nCODY: WHAT THE PEEPER SAW (1972)\n\nWant to watch an evil Kid movie where he wants to fuck his Step Mom? Then boy do I have the movie for you! A slow and plodding movie that wastes a ton of time and has to cram 2/3rds of a movie into 1/3rd at the end. Unless you really like “Shock” flicks this is not worth a watch.\n\nRobin: Among the Living (2014).\n\nI’ve got a streak of good ones going, I’m a little scared. This one is French. The plot is super simple but the movie as a whole is effective. The way the shots are framed and the beats the plot hits, this reminds me of a graphic novel.\n\nJAMES: Body Cam (2020)\n\nEVAN: BLOOD DINER (1987, Jackie Kong, Hulu):\n\nI want to like this one. But I only really enjoyed the first and final ten minutes. Bonus points for female director, especially when she’s out-grossing many of the gross-out boys of the genre. I enjoyed the mythos created with Lumeria/Lemuria and the resurrection of the goddess. Apparently this was conceived as a sequel to BLOOD FEAST, but it ended up more of a parody of it. The prologue captured me, with creativity and wry humor and occultism that went deeper than an upturned contact lens. Then there’s an hour or so of steamin hot trash, and it finally climaxes with a zombie-rocknroll-Lovecraftian clusterfuck. You’ll either love it or despise it. Or both?\n\nJAY: CARDS OF DEATH (1986, You Tube)\n\nARE YOU READY TO GAMBLE… *dunn dun dunnnnnn* …WITH YOUR LIFE?! 😂\n\nI expected very little from this film, and was pleasantly surprised. It’s not very action packed until the end, but it is surprisingly clever and unique for what it is.\n\nI’m not sure how buyable the premise of being forced into gambling for your life is, but it gets pretty crazy in moments.\n\nAside from some pretty ear-gratingly bad sound FX that get thrown on repeat waaay too many times, this is (overall) a decent horror flick.\n\nAug 21st – Day 30 – 71 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: The Brides of Dracula (1960)\n\nEntertaining enough if not somewhat formulaic. Where I enjoyed the cast it didn’t have some of the energy of previous Hammer Films I’ve enjoyed.\n\nbob:\n\nHP Lovecraft Film Festival; 130th Birthday online festival. Presented as an alternative to the not-happening this year for obvious reasons Providence festival, this 4 hour streaming version is also a preview for the 3 day festival in October (the one that would normally be in Portland).\n\nThe selection was, I think, about 13 titles (some based on Lovecraft, some from other horror authors like Poe, and some just in tone). I wrote down notes at the start and stopped after a while. Some were new, and some were culled from old titles including two from the first festival 20 years ago.\n\nOne, The Summoning, had our own Eric all over the credits (along with Kelly Young) woo hoo!\n\nAs the shorts go, I was honestly a thumb mostly up for them all. None wowed me but none were bad either. There was a focus on more serious titles (mostly, Faust was fun and silly – and stop motion) and the first few were dour!\n\nLooking forward to the festival in October (followed by Bone Bat the next weekend, my poor wife is going to lose me to a few hundred short films for two weekends in a row!)\n\nCODY: The Case of the Scorpion’s Tail(1971)\n\nFucking masterpiece, legitimately one of my favorite Giallo films I have ever seen. George Hilton provides a performance for the ages in this. I am going to leave with a hot take, Sergio Martino is seriously one of the best Giallo filmmakers ever and I would personally place him above even Argento.\n\nROBIN: MONSTER PARTY (2019, Shudder)\n\nI know a lot of people watched this one last year for the 100 Days. It was pretty enjoyable. I thought the concept was original and played out in an interesting way.\n\nJAMES: Lodgers (2017)\n\nEVAN:\n\nTHE SECT/ La Setta aka The Devil’s Daughter aka Demons 4 (1991, Michele Soavi, Scarecrow Video)\n\nThis is one of the best art-horror films I’ve ever seen. It’s slick, imaginative, and very, very weird. Images repeat in smart, calculated ways. Cowritten by Argento, It starts with a Satanic biker gang (led by a Charles Manson Jesus lookalike) murdering a family of hippies, then flash forward to present day. Then we get a filthy old mystery man with a filthy old mysterious parcel, a bug-cam up someone’s nostril, and one of the best dream sequences I’ve ever seen. That’s the first half hour. If you wondered where Ari Aster got some of the ideas for HEREDITARY, he clearly stole shamelessly from this film. There are also Easter eggs for fans of Lovecraft, Cronenberg, HELLRAISER, and THE SHINING. Plus: Evil rabbits! Evil pelicans! Evil water! Evil shroud of Turin! Evil feathers! Evil clocks! Evil blue! Fun trivia: star Kelly Curtis is the daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, which means she’s also Jamie Lee Curtis’s sister, which you can totally see in her face at times. Also, if you can get a version with spoken English plus English subtitles, there are some very interesting discrepancies between the two. Highly, highly recommended.\n\nJAY: Dial Code Santa Claus / Deadly Games / 3615 code Père Noël (1989, YT, Prime)\n\nSo like… if Rambo and MacGyver had a genius kid, and that kid starred in Home Alone, but with an older santa from Silent Night Deadly Night…\n\nThat’d be this movie.\n\nThat’s pretty much it.\n\nIt’s neat. Some hilarity, some action-packed moments. Not really gory or anything. It’s a decent cat-and-mouse flick.\n\nFull warning: **SPOILER** – they kill the dog, and it does NOT cut away. Didn’t like that.\n\nAug 20th – Day 29 – 72 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: COLD PURSUIT (2019)\n\nThis is maybe a stretch to count but whatever, we’re watching 100 movies. It’s fine.\n\nI enjoyed the sense of humor. It was sort of exactly what it promised to be from the previews.\n\nBOB SEA FEVER (2020, Hulu)\n\nIn Ireland, a marine biology doctorate student has to go to sea on a fishing trawler. It doesn’t go well, starting with the mere fact she’s a redhead (in Ireland, a stretch I know) An omen for the women and men of the boat (the most known of the cast are the captains/owners Dougray Scott and Connie Neilson). They soon run across a tentacled creature straight out of Lovecraft.\n\nBut don’t think you know where this is going, this isn’t Deep Rising. Instead we have a story of how a crew of people approach something they can’t quite understand that slowly threatens their safety, sanity, and lives. Yes, there are shades of other movies – Alien, the Thing, other parasite based films – but Sea Fever never feels like a copy. It’s a story where the characters often make the wrong decision, but we understand why. Essentially, they act like real people – their reactions to things as they unfold felt genuine.\n\nAnother good flick (I am working down metacritic of the horror titles free to me so no surprise keep getting good ones, I’m in that section!)\n\nCODY: The Corpse Grinders (1971)\n\nA movie that I had seen a good portion on years ago from a godawful DVD print. Counting this one since I’ve now seen it in its entirety and on a beautifully remastered cut by Vinegar Syndrome. Corpse Grinders is a terrible film but the passion for it that oozes through the movie gives it an odd charm. Gory, gross and gaudy, it’s carried by it’s ridiculous premise and the actors who are giving their all to make their mark on film history.\n\nJAMES: LIKE ME (2018)\n\nROBIN: Rigor Mortis (2013).\n\nI have Anthony James Kay to thank for this one. I freakin’ loved it. The imagery is bleak but beautiful. Great characters. Doesn’t pull punches. I need to permanently add this one to my library.\n\nEVAN: DELIRIA aka Stagefright (1987, Michele Soavi, Scarecrow Video): Surprisingly entertaining! Fast paced, creative, and it opens with a campy as fuck sequence. Seems like after giallo influenced American slashers, this is an example of the American tropes giving back (masked killer, single night plot, etc). All giallo should be this good.\n\nBRIEN: Thirty Miles from Nowhere (Shudder) – I guess it’s a horror version of The Big Chill (which they namedrop in the first ten minutes). A strong cast makes this movie work sometimes, though I think I enjoyed the comedy-drama moments far more than the “scares” or the “big twist.” Carrie Preston (unsurprisingly) steals the show with extra quirk. The ending is a bit of a head scratcher (not in a good way), but it has some good moments in it.\n\nJAY: Blood Frenzy (1987, Youtube)\n\nMore of a ‘who-dun-it’ than a blood frenzy of any kind. Some pretty extreme personality types in this one; but I guess it goes with the plot.\n\nNot super gory or anything, just a mediocre foray into a “who’s the killer” trope. Nothing remarkable.\n\nIt’s meh.\n\nAug 19th – Day 28 – 73 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: Spellcaster (1988)\n\nThere was a weird music number at the beginning and I was disappointed that it was really the only one. If there were more, it would have been a more entertaining movie.\n\nBob: UNCLE PECKERHEAD (2020)\n\nUncle Peckerhead is a hard film to truly rate. It feels amateur and cheap, the script is lacking, the lead character is very unlikable and no one’s acting is anything to write home about. BUT… its’ also very entertaining with an easy charm that makes it a very palatable and very funny film to those who are willing to go through.\n\nAs I was texting with Eric, it’s a movie you will either completely go along with or completely reject. A nearly failed rock band has set up a last ditch tour. Their van is repo’d and an older guy who looks like a cross between Sid Haig and Tom Towles agrees to let them use his van as long as he can drive and roadie. He’s weird, crass, a ltitle-too nice… and has the unfortunate issue that he turns to limb ripping, throat tearing demon every night between midnight and 12:13. (oh yes, there are geysers of blood!). David Littleton as the title character embodies the movie – he’s both a pretty flat performance but effortlessly likeable (for a character that could easily be offputting).\n\nSo for those who will dig something to this matter – a really pared down Deathgasm type flick-, Uncle Peckerhead is for you.\n\nPS. I really liked the music\n\nCODY: HOST (2020, Shudder)\n\nBasically what would happen if Unfriended was good. This tight, tense and unnerving found footage/Zoom hybrid definitely lives up to the hype. Worth a watch on Shudder!\n\nJAMES: HALLOWED BE THY NAME (2020)\n\nROBIN: Crawlers (2020).\n\nThis is part of the Into the Dark series on Hulu. This could have been a lot better. I feel like there were some MAJOR post production/test audience issues because there’s a wraparound where the lead actress looks completely different (so probably shot well after the fact) and a record-scratch voiceover every couple minutes for the first 2/3 of the movie. Show don’t tell, filmmakers!\n\nBRIEN: THE EVIL (Shudder)\n\nFairly standard haunted house film from the 70’s – A psychology professor and his team attempt to renovate an old house into a drug rehabilitation center and in the process disturb a menacing presence. Practical effects mixed with some bad video effects create an uneven delivery, but it has a pretty strong atmosphere throughout. Then it takes a crazy turn in the third act – fans of the Adam West Batman series are in for a treat.\n\nEVAN: SORORITY BABES IN THE SLIMEBALL BOWL-O-RAMA (1988, DeCoteau, SHUDDER): This is 100% as stupid as the title implies. David DeCoteau makes a non-gay horror movie (he was young and needed the money) released by Full Moon, and Linnea Quigley gets top billing. This film is 79 minutes long, including two minutes of blank-screen opening credits. Kills don’t begin until 45 minutes in. These minor details should tell you everything. Quigley does steal the show, but I turned it off before she showed her breasts. Maybe she’s the only woman in this film who doesn’t.\n\nJAY: IT FOLLOWS (2014)\n\nI know this is one everybody absolutely adores. It was pretty good – buyable characters, interesting and novel plot.\n\nI just have so many questions. I feel like a ton was left unresolved, or up to metaphorical interpretation from the viewer.\n\nAnd a killer STD ghost totally seems like something that a high school abstinence group would put together to scare people away from sex.\n\nERIC: SPOOKIES (1983)\n\nThis is a bad movie. It is also an entertaining movie. Filled with strange creatures, decent to bad make-up effects, ok to painfully bad acting, and an ending that is a crazy change in style.\n\nIt also has farting monsters and critters that look like big Boglins. What is the movie about?\n\nThe movie is lovingly remasted by the crazy people of Vinegar Syndrome.\n\nAug 18th – Day 27 – 74 Days of Halloween\n\nKIM: Assassination Nation (2018)\n\nI have a lot of thoughts about this and a lot to say. The aesthetic was really interesting and flashy, but despite only being a few years old the film felt incredibly dated to me. It’s also very obviously directed and written by a man and tries a little too hard to be feminist while managing to objectify every female character.\n\nBOB: VIVARIUM (2020, Prime)\n\nVivarium is a delightful delicious twisted tale of a metaphor in the mundanity of the scariness of suburbia. It has the feeling of somewhere between The Twilight Zone and Black Mirror, Vivarium is as subtle as a brick but it works so well. This is a new favorite of the year (when I update my letterboxd tomorrow we’ll see what number it lands on – I keep running diary and 2020 list). Like another TZ-ish (but very different end the spectrum) Vast of Night – also on prime and also amazing), it is less of the answers to what the hell weird shit is going on but how the characters react and watching it unfold. (Like the Platform, the fabric its woven from is metaphor so don’t expect the logic to be sound. Just roll with it)\n\nJesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots worked together really well in 2019’s underseen jet black comedy of toxic masculinity The Art of Self Defense (not horror but on Hulu, I highly recommend) and they pair well as the troubled but loving couple here, who are stuck in a never ending identical neighborhood (see, not subtle at all). They have a natural chemistry that plays very well (no “oh Jesse Eisenburg is a one trick pony” comments, he’s truly better than that rep). The whole thing keeps the viewer very off kilter. Not quite disturbed but ill at ease.\n\nCODY: SCARE PACKAGE (2020, Shudder)\n\nFinding a Horror Comedy that’s actually funny is rare. Scare Package delivers a hilarious and wonderfully meta take on Horror and Anthologies. Definitely worth a watch and on Shudder!\n\nRobin: Open Grave (2013).\n\nI really dug this. I’ve liked Sharlto Copley in everything that I’ve seen him in so far. This involves memory loss, so of course some of the story is told in snippets of flashback. That kind of plotline can go horribly bad, but I think the director did a great job with it here.\n\nJAMES: HANUKKAH (2019)\n\nBrien: Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1973, Prime)\n\nThere’s not enough swashbuckling horror in the world. Thankfully we have Captain Kronos. I wish they’d continued the adventures of Kronos and Grost. It’s fun and weird and I’m pretty sure he kills more ignorant villagers than vampires, but that’s why this movie is a party.\n\nEVAN: EXTREME GHOSTBUSTERS\n\ni worshipped the Real Ghostbusters cartoon as a kid. Most of my monster obsession is rooted there and the original film. In the 90s, the cartoon got a reboot/sequel with four new young ghostbusters led by Egon and assisted by Janine and Slimer. Going back to watch through it, there’s some intense shit in this one season. My favorite episode is of course “Deadliners,” which unapologetically recreates HELLRAISER for children, with body modified cenobites and everything (it also tips the hat to IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS). Other highlights include killer plants, an insect god, and a demon that steals eyes. Fun for the whole family!\n\nERIC: Babysitter Killer Queen. A fun film. Tried a little too hard to be clever but then again it is a McG film. If you liked the first one this is worth a watch.\n\nJAY: CANDYMAN (1992, Hulu)\n\nI am stoked for the new one, so I decided to revisit the original, which I haven’t seen in a good 20+ years.\n\nThis movie is so good! Candyman is a superbly crafted slasher that fires hard on all levels. It’s gory, it’s incredibly chilling, it’s tense, the whole vibe of this film is just eerie and dangerous. The characters are gripping and it really drew me in and kept me on the edge of my seat. Plus that ending is an emotional rollercoaster. Holy shit.\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite slashers, and I hope the new one does it justice (whenever it comes out).\n\nAug 17th – Day 26 – 75 Days to Halloween\n\nKIM: ICE CREAM MAN (1995)\n\nWhat nice things can I say about Ice Cream Man? It is a movie.\n\nAlso. Olivia Hussey. Let’s talk. I’m concerned.\n\nBob – BLOOD QUANTUM (2020, Shudder) Blood Quantum is a hell of a zombie movie, reminding me of nihilistic sadness present of the Romero films. And a good slice of the gore too – the wholly practical gut rippings (and many others) harken to Savini’s work. Although reflecting back to the best of the gerne, Blood Quantum also feels fresh with the angle of how it affects a Quebecois Indian reservation. Thus, there is a lens of colonialism and First Nation/white relationship. Also nice is we see both the start of the apocalypse and the new society. There is an affecting look and color palette to the film as well. The down side is the characters are little underwritten and stiffy acted, but it is great to have a cast made up mostly of First Nation people.\n\nCody: The Night of the Werewolf (1981)\n\nA great Reluctant Werewolf flick. Love Naschy’s performance in this as the conflicted Hero Waldemar Dalinsky. Honestly one of the better Werewolf interpretations I have seen.\n\nROBIN: ICE CREAM MAN (1995)\n\nI had to experience this one for myself. On the tamer side, but definitely still right there in that 90’s Dr Giggles type vein. Couple of quick points… 1) Oh my god, that fat suit! 2) Olivia Hussey is gorgeous even when she’s 40-something pretending to be an elderly woman. 3) Half melted ice cream is just disgusting.\n\nJAMES: PORTAL (2019)\n\nEVAN: WOLF GUY (Urufu-gai) (1975, Yamaguchi, kanopy): the description says this wasn’t available outside Japan until recently. Having been on a blaxploitation horror kick last month or so, this reminds me a lot of that style of 70s film. A werewolf detective investigates an invisible tiger that’s been ripping apart yakuzas. He traces it to a psychic woman and the rest is, well, fuckin bonkers, including vivisection. Interestingly, the protagonist is continually saved by women. Like three different women at least come to his rescue. Hot. Trigger warning: some ugly violence against women, frequently sexual.\n\nBRIEN: THE UNCANNY (Prime)\n\nAn anthology about killer cats. Produced by one of the founders of Amicus. Peter Cushing in an amazing wrap-around. Donald Pleasance. Do I need to keep going? And yes – you will root for the cats in every story.\n\nJAY: Crawl (2019, Hulu)\n\nBeen wanting to see this one for a while now.\n\nSo I fully tempered my expectations for “Alligator” level insanity, and went into this with an open mind.\n\nIt’s pretty good for a modern horror flick. Simple plot, good acting, and a fair chunk of action and gore. I don’t really have anything to dislike about this movie. It’s what you’d expect from a huge budget/big studio horror film.\n\nWould I have liked more gore, “WTF” or “OH SHIT” factors, or more batshit crazy insanity moments? Sure.\n\nDid it have a cute heart-to-heart moment mid-way through? Sure.\n\nCould I do without frequent jump-scares? Sure.\n\nCrawl was a fun enough watch. If we’re comparing, it’s not as insane as “Alligator”, so if you’re really itching for a crazy movie of this sort, start there. Otherwise, it’s pretty good overall for what it is.\n\nERIC: It’s Alive 3: Island of the Alive I liked this one more than the 2nd. It was more insane and over the top, just the way I like a Cohen movie. Larry film regular Micheal Moriarty takes over in the leading role and is joined by Karen Black. It is a strange conclusion to the trilogy and worth checking out.\n\nAug 16th – Day 25- 76 Days of Halloween\n\nKIM: Darkroom (1989)\n\nThis movie is a masterclass in bad acting.\n\nBOB: SCREAM, QUEEN! MY NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (2020, Shudder)\n\nA fascinating documentary at the once-reviled Nightmare sequel and the life of its once missing for 20 years star Mark Patton. I’ll admit when I was in high school I didn’t care for Elm Street 2. It was weird, different than the others and didn’t feature into series continuity it all. Maybe the very gay nature of the film had something to do with that on my end, I dunno. Perhaps. Like many, I eventually came around to like it. (I have always thought part 5 is the worst, and still hold to this)\n\nWhen I started to really get into horror, I did wonder where Mark went, a bunch of credits on imdb and then… nothing. As it turns, he fled Hollywood as the film essentially outted him and as AIDS loomed. The movie itself gets into the details, so I’ll not repeat those here. There is much sadness and heartbreak, as there is anytime we get into the AIDS epidemic.\n\nAs we see anytime we have documentaries looking at the impact – even if delayed- of a film or (sub)genre, there is a certain amount of preaching to the choir over many o the details and interviews (and many quips are repeated). But as a film major (on the talking about side rather than the making), I personally enjoyed seeing how the film has been contextualized in academica and culture in events like Evan’s SLASH.\n\nCODY: Human Beasts (1980)\n\nAnother entry from my Paul Naschy Blu Ray collection. Think a splash of Texas Chainsaw on top of a Giallo and an action adventure revenge flick. Definitely an interesting watch for sure.\n\nROBIN: The Wicker Man (2006). It wasn’t as bad as I was expecting, but it definitely wasn’t good either. So many weird choices by his character. At least the blowhard nature of the policeman in the original was due to religion and by-the-book-ness. Cage’s just seemed to be a general superiority complex. Also, I hated the added ‘s’ in Summersisle.\n\nJAMES: THE WOLF HOUR (2019)\n\nEVAN: SPLINTER (2008, Hoopla, Toby Wilkins): This one is AWESOME. Short (80 mins), tight, and it had me in suspense constantly. What starts with some tweakers taking a couple hostage quickly becomes a monster movie that convincingly reinvents the zombie genre. Body horror a-go-go (my thing, you may have noticed). The contagion is never explained (there’s one shot of an “experimental” oil drilling facility), it just infects people with an organism that makes splintery growths emerge from the skin (and everywhere else). Bonus points for zombies that can merge into megazombies and for reinventing the severed zombie hand trope. The final girl is BADASS and her nebbish boyfriend eventually rises to the occasion. I’m not sure why I love movies like this and want to rub them all over my face, while I’m deeply disturbed by non-supernatural torture porn. It’s okay when zombies or werewolves rip out your guts but other people? Too scary for me. It’s not flawless, but hot damn was this everything I look for in a horror movie.\n\nBRIEN: Dolls (Amazon Prime) A Charles Band produced movie directed by Stuart Gordon. There are worse ways to spend an hour and change than watching terrible people get their comeuppance from vengeful dolls. Also interesting that two years later Band would write the story for the very similar Puppet Master… I’m sure there’s a story there…\n\nJAY VIVARIUM (2020, Prime)\n\nIn my humble opinion, this was a terribly bland, inconsistent, nonsensical, annoying, and inconsistent movie.\n\nVery unlikable characters (also did they only cast people with blue eyes for this?) especially the boy. Pretty much all dialogue until the end is a real cringe fest.\n\nSorta spoilers:\n\nI couldn’t keep up with the inconsistency here. I mean, that’s fine in a film if it’s so wild there’s a ton going on, but Vivarium is the antithesis of that.\n\nIt’s deliberately bland and repetitive with really not a lot going on.\n\nSo why? That was my repeated question throughout. Why only one time lapse that wasn’t particularly relevant? Then back to regular time?\n\nWhy in the world would any rational person choose to proceed with such an initially unsettling person? What was the point of keeping them? What was the point of the whole thing, really?\n\nJust very nonsensical with seemingly no rhyme or reason.\n\nAlso some missed opportunities to turn into a crazy stalker slasher or creature feature.\n\nInstead, the filmmakers choose to drive home the minimalist blah for, who knows what reason.\n\nDid not love this.\n\nAug 15th -Day 24- 77 Days of Halloween\n\nKIM: VICTOR CROWLEY\n\nWatched with last nights Last Drive In. Couldn’t count Slumber Party Massacre II since I’d seen it, but this was first viewing of #VictorCrowley for me. I thought it was a lot of fun and very entertaining.\n\nBOB: THE OTHER LAMB (2020, HULU)\n\nThe Other Lamb is a quietly disturbing, beautifully shot film. Selah (Raffey Cassidy in a mesmerizing performance) is a young woman on he edge of puberty when the cult she has grown up within – all women (wives) and girls (daughters, with the implication of becoming wives) with one man Shepherd (Michiel Huisman of Haunting of Hill House, Invitation) is forced to move. As she starts to get his attention, she reflects on her understanding of her life.\n\nI appreciate the detail in setting up this commune and insular world. The hierarchy and lives of the women (and man) are allowed to be presented without obvious exposition and my wife and I enjoyed trying to suss out the whos and the hows.\n\nThe Other Lamb is a quiet, insular film anchored by understated and engaging leads.\n\nCODY: The Fog(1980)\n\nA solid Carpenter flick that ticks a lot of boxes. I’m left underwhelmed especially with the pacing of the flick, it takes so long to get out of first gear that it makes the latter half incredibly rushed. Great performances by Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau and Hal Holbrook however elevate the film above the above issues.\n\nBRIEN: Terror Train (Amazon Prime)\n\nA college frat plans a party on a private train. A serial killer joins the fun. Of course it all starts with a prank gone bad. There’s a magician on the train and I’m thinking, “Wow, they got a magician who looks like David Copperfield…” because it’s David Frickin’ Copperfield doing close up magic for the kiddos. And – Jamie Lee Curtis! There are a couple of good swerves and misdirects with the identity of the killer and the typical bumbling cops have been replaced with bumbling train conductors, so that was nice.\n\nEVAN: BODY BAGS (1992, Carpenter and Hooper, Shudder): John Carpenter does his best Cryptkeeper as the wraparound narrator in this silly anthology. He also directs the first two segments: first, what is unquestionably a rehash of HALLOWEEN, complete with recreated iconic shots. Maybe he’s paying homage to himself? The second segment is a bonkers surreal horror sci fi spoof. Very creative though. And then the third segment, directed by Tobe Hooper. I could’ve definitely lived without seeing Mark Hamill rape Twiggy while imagining fucking a corpse. It was just tacky tacky tacky. Bad taste from start to finish. Nonetheless, the film is packed with cameos: Wes Craven, David Naughton, Sam Raimi, Roger Corman, and on and on and on. For fans of CREEPSHOW, TALES FROM THE CRYPT, and people who don’t mind watching Luke Skywalker brutalize a supermodel.\n\nROBIN: Color Out of Space (2019).\n\nPretty good. I’m very glad that Richard Stanley got a chance to direct again, all these years later. I hope the plans for a Lovecraft trilogy come to fruition. I liked the asthetics of this and the fact that they don’t feel like they need to show too much.\n\nJAMES: THE AMARANTH (2018)\n\nERIC: SURVIVAL QUEST (1984)\n\nOk this really isn’t horror but it is Don Coscarelli directing Lance Hendrickson and Dermot Mulroney in 1988’s Survival Quest. It’s a touch above a made for TV movie but still fun to watch.\n\nJay: Guinea Pig: Devil’s Experiment (1985, Youtube)\n\nStarting to work through some of the rough ones in the queue. Admittedly, I love the Guinea Pig series, but oddly I’ve never seen the first one.\n\nI had some “Flowers of Flesh & Blood” expectations going in, and while there are certainly some parallels, this isn’t the ‘straight-to-dismemberment’ fiasco FOF&B is.\n\nIt is torture porn. So… if that’s not your bag, you will not want to bother with this film. However, Devil’s Experiment plays out far more like a psychological, completely-break-the-spirit type of torture. There is nothing done that would actually kill the victim, although it is pretty grueling and unnerving to watch. Some of the torture seems a bit bizarre, honestly.\n\nBarring the notorious cover scene, it’s really not gory at all… more of an experiment in brutality and completely breaking someone mentally.\n\nIt fits well into the series; but the initial 10 minute assault is excessive and a tough watch. It also lacks the creativity, or artistic merit to many of the others in the series.\n\nDidn’t love it or hate it. Wouldn’t recommend starting the series with this one. Start with Mermaid in a Manhole or FOF&B if you’re more of a gorehound.\n\nJOULE: What We Do in the Shadows (Hulu). Does this count? I’ve been trying to finish a project and can’t concentrate on anything longer than 20 minutes so these scrumptious little episodes are perfect right now. Current favorite line: “If I want you I’ll call you. But not through the ether. Just by regular yelling.”\n\nAug 14th – Day 23 – 78 Days of Halloween\n\nKIM: TRICK (2019)\n\nSometimes, I watch a movie and I get actively angry at the time I gave up to watch it. Yeah.\n\nBOB: THE BEACH HOUSE (2020, Shudder)\n\nA young couple get away to his parent’s beach house to try to fix a rift in their relationship. When they get there, they find another couple inside. But the film also starts with an underwater rift opening, and there are some Colour Out of Space bio-luminescence and a John Carpenter-like Fog at night. A lot of different set-ups. Where shall the movie go?\n\nI’m not going to tell! But I dug this tight little flick. Four people (and two voices), two locations – I’m always in for that. It’s a pretty small film, and that might turn away some, but I appreciated not getting stupid big or not getting a lot of answers.But there is a nice sense of dread and some good shocks and that goes a long way.\n\nNot a great film, but darn good enough.\n\nCODY: DRAG ME TO HELL (2009)\n\nThis did not click at all for me. An over reliance on jumpscares combined with a weak story and predictable ending leaves this one as just kinda lame. Justin Long is good in it at least.\n\nBrien: EMPIRE OF THE ANTS\n\nBased on an HG Wells story, this is a giant ant movie with a pretty crazy twist in the last half hour. Put the horrendous attempts at 70’s compositing aside and there’s a pretty interesting story here. There are little glimpses of closeup practical effects and I wish they’d done more with that. But it stars Joan Collins, so it feels like a win to me.\n\nEVAN: TRICK OR TREAT aka RAGMAN (1986, Charles Martin Smith, YouTube): Well then. Here’s an 80s horror film if there ever was one. A popular heavy metal singer uses demonic magic to come back from death through a cursed album. A humiliated, bullied teen uses the album to get revenge, but quickly loses his desire for vengeance when things get too deadly. There is a demonic sexual assault and then a near-rape between all too ordinary teens. Utterly gratuitous. Also Includes cameos from Ozzy Osbourne as an anti-rock preacher and Gene Simmons as a radio dj. Side note, just because I love telling people: Simmons was born in Israel, and his birth name is Chaim Witz. Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley are geeky gangly Jewish kids who somehow became rock stars and had sex with thousands of women. But I digress. This film never quite reaches its zenith–the special effects aren’t too bad, but the momentum fizzles in the end. If you like SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE 2, THE GATE, or PAGANINI HORROR, try this one out.\n\nROBIN: Vampire’s Kiss (1988). Jesus Christ this was a tough watch. Did this actually play as comedy once upon a time? Nic Cage’s character spends the entire movie grinding women under his heels, especially his secretary Alva, whom he straight up terrorizes. I can allow a lot for the sake of character, but holy crap, they really went too far overboard with this one. Ugh.\n\nJAMES: THE SONATA (2020)\n\nJAY:\n\nThe Burning Moon (1992, I think this is on Prime & Shudder; watched on YT)\n\nDon’t let the cartoony cover fool you – this is an absolutely excessive, boundary-pushing, blood-soaked, splatterfest.\n\nThis movie is incredibly violent from beginning to end.\n\n*Not really spoilers* Two stories; one is a date that goes about as ba"
