        "text": "NEWS\n\nAMERICAN RELEASE DATES ANNOUNCED\n\nINBRED VOTED TOP HORROR FILM 2012\n\nINBRED WINS GORIEST FILM AND BEST KILL AT TORONTO AFTER DARK\n\nWe are so pleased to finally announce that INBRED is coming out in the USA and CANADA in August! It will be available as a download from August 22nd and then available to buy and own and touch and feel in beautiful DVD and glorious Bluray on September 24th!!!\n\n2013 means that we at INBRED central can wind down our duties somewhat as INBRED's World Domination is almost complete! We hope to become available in every country but the fickle nature of film distribution in these desperate days means that it is difficult to secure a legitimate release in many smaller territories.\n\nWe are more than aware that people unable to see INBRED from a legitimate source will watch it from the many torrent sites which we can do nothing about. We just hope that given the opportunity you will pay to watch INBRED in some form or donate to our next production... we hope to enable people to watch our next film on the same day everywhere in the world for one dollar a view. That is our dream.\n\nJANUARY 2013\n\nHappy New Year! We wish everyone who reads this a Big Dirty Happy New Year from all of us Inbreds! We hope INBRED gets as great a welcome in 2013 as we recieved in 2012. We have lots of releases to look forward to and lots more people to terrify! Long Live The New Flesh.\n\nDECEMBER 2012\n\nINBRED is voted BEST HORROR FILM OF 2012 by our new best friends at www.horror-movies.ca. This is a really nice way to end the most amazing year. INBRED is well on its way to doing everything we wanted it to do and so much more. We'd like to thank everyone involved in the journey that has got INBRED seen and enjoyed around the world by thousands.\n\nNOVEMBER 2012\n\nINBRED wins BEST FILM at the prestigious Ravenna Nightmare Filmfest in Ravenna, Italy. The translated press release reads: \"The Jury of the International Competition for Feature Films unanimously decided to award the Golden Ring Award for Best Film in competition to INBRED by British director Alex Chandon.\" Cool!\n\nINBRED tours Australia! Director Alex Chandon was kindly invited by our Australian distributor Monster Pictures to introduce INBRED at MONSTER FEST in Melbourne and then at the Brisbane International Film Festival but a schedule issue meant that Alex missed the Brisbane screening.. but thoroughly enjoyed his extended visit. We can happily report that Australians love INBRED and they laughed solidly all through the gore. Monster Pictures report that INBRED pre-sales are rocketing and so we look forward to the Australian release early next year. For those on FACEBOOK you can see part one of Alex's photos of his visit HERE.\n\nExcellent start to November as Variety announces INBRED's USA distributor XLrator with an exclusive PRESS RELEASE, to coincide with the start of AFM, the American Film Market.\n\nWe are all very excited to be working with XLrator and hope that our US release happens really soon! watch this space for more details!\n\nOCTOBER 2012\n\nOctober ends with INBRED winning awards at film festivals around the world!\n\nWe are really happy to be part of Toronto After Dark this year, in such great company of films. And we are thrilled to recieve TWO Fan Awards! GORIEST FILM and BEST KILL. That suits us fine! Thank you Canada!\n\nINBRED wins BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS at the Bram Stoker Film Festival in glorious Whitby, UK. The award is accepted on behalf of the FX team by Graham Taylor at GT FX.\n\nINBRED has its USA Premiere! Finally!\n\nWe screened at Telluride Horror Show in Colorado and Phoenix FearCon in Arizona and the audiences loved us!\n\nINBRED is unleashed on DVD and BLURAY in the UK! The response is wonderful.\n\nWe hit #3 in Morrisons in Cardiff and #9 in HMV in Oxford Street and #122 on IMDB!\n\nGreat reviews popping up, see the REVIEWS page, and a great buzz on Facebook and Twitter and sales doing really well we hear! Thanks all in the UK! Please spread the word further and further... it's with the help of all our fans that we've been able to be noticed and it's great horror fans are loving INBRED.\n\nINBRED had its Irish premiere in Cork’s Triskel Arts cinema on October 10th and producer Margaret Milner Schmueck who went over to her home town for the screening. Despite it being the wettest Wednesday night the city had seen in quite some time, and the screening being sandwiched between the Folk Festival and International Guinness Jazz festival, Margaret was both surprised and very pleased to see quite a turn out on the night. She said “It felt like a real milestone to be able to bring INBRED home to Cork and my only regret was that I didn’t bring along a bag of T-shirts to sell as the enquiries were fast on that front. It was the first time I heard the final soundtrack with the screening from the Bluray and generally thought the whole deal rocked”.\n\nG'day! Australian News to kick off October. We are very pleased to announce that Monster Pictures will be releasing INBRED in Australia and New Zealand, kicking off with a screening in Melbourne as part of Monster Fest in November!\n\nAnd INBRED has been invited to screen as the prestigious Brisbane International Film Festival also in November.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2012\n\nEe by Gum! It's the Inbred Song by The Inbred Band! By popular demand we created a video for the 'Ee By Gum' song from the film that everyone keeps clapping along too. Written by Neil Keenan, who plays Vern in the film, this is Yorkshire's very unofficial bid for the Christmas No.1 spot!\n\nYou can watch the music video on YOUTUBE HERE.\n\nThe song is available to download for 79p from iTunes... you know you have to download it!\n\nDOWNLOAD iTunes LINK HERE\n\nINBRED gets a UK cinema release! A limited release made sure we generated a whole lot of press and promotion leading up to the DVD and Bluray release. The film went through the review gauntlet of the UK press and came out relatively unscathed. INBRED got better reviews than Oliver Stones SAVAGES that opened on the same day.\n\nSeptember is a busy month for film festivals and INBRED goes down a storm at premieres in Portugal (MOTEL X) and Germany (Fantasy Film Festival) and Austria (Slash Film Fest) and Denmark (Bloody Weekend)and a return to Spain at the XIII Costa del Sol Fantasy Film Festival scoops INBRED two festival awards! BEST SPECIAL FX and BEST SOUNDTRACK!\n\nWEBSITE CHANGES: Anchor Bay are going to be re-styling the website gearing up for the UK release, so expect to see their brilliant new poster up here soon, retail links, more videos soon and lots of cool announcements! We will still include news on Foreign releases and Festival screenings, so no matter where you live this is still your port of call for INBRED news and updates.\n\nINBRED goes Japanese! We are thrilled to hear that INBRED will get a theatrical release in Japan on 29th September, and we love the JAPANESE INBRED WEBSITE.\n\nAUGUST 2012\n\nAugust ends in triumphant style as INBRED returns to FRIGHTFEST for a very experiMENTAL screening. A live commentary event where director Alex Chandon spoke over the film with anecdotes about the making of. The screening ended with Alex joined by Neil Keenan and his banjo for a rousing rendition of 'Ee By Gum - The Inbred Song', during which they got the whole cinema audience singing along and then proceeded to walk into the foyer of the Empire Leicester Square en masse singing away and creating some Inbred mayhem! You can see a funny video of the event on YOUTUBE HERE.\n\nAnchor Bay UK announce the INBRED release date! October 15th on DVD and Bluray, with, we hope, a small theatrical release preceeding that! We are all very excited.\n\nINBRED returns to Thirsk, North Yorksire to where it all began. We organised a special screening for all the locals who helped the production that took place in Thirsk's own small cinema, The Ritz, which is celebrating its 100th year this year. The event was a great success with a packet cinema and delighted punters afterwards. Thirsk approves of INBRED!\n\nJULY 2012\n\nINBRED's last port of call in July was PIFAN, The Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival in Bucheon, South Korea. Director Alex was kindly invited to represent INBRED and missed the London Olympic Opening Ceremony in his home town to fly the flag for INBRED in very sunny Korea!\n\nINBRED played at three sold out screenings and Alex's Q & A session after one screening lasted a record 55 minutes.\n\nThe audience loved the film and laughed loads. The Korean subtitles must have worked!\n\nWe never expected INBRED to be appreciated by such a world wide audience and so it was a complete pleasure to have such a great response. We thank you PIFAN and Korea!\n\nFor those on FACEBOOK, you can see Alex's photo diary of his visit HERE, and part 2 HERE\n\nINBRED wins BEST FILM at the 8th Grossmann Film & Wine Festival in Ljutomer, Slovenia!\n\nThis is INBRED's best award to date and it came from such a lovely festival. The organisers were amazing and the three screenings, one in the main square at night (atmospheric!) were packed and a real success.\n\nINBRED shared first prize with Jaume Balagueró's SLEEP TIGHT. Alex is a big fan of Jaume's work, especially REC so he was incredibly chuffed when Juame said that as an 18 year old he purchased Alex's first VHS gore films BAD KARMA and DRILLBIT from the famous cult movie shop 'Psychotronic' in Camden Town. And those films inspired him! The festival was also screening films by Julian Richards and Lee Hardcastle, two fellow Brit directors whose work Alex admires. Alex ranks this as one of his best festival experiences of the year.\n\nFilm & Wine Festivals Rock! if you are on FACEBOOK you can see photos of Alex's adventures in Slovenia HERE.\n\nAlex and INBRED have been invited to Slovenia for the Grossman Festival and then to Pifan Film Festival in Korea, which will be our Asian Premiere. You can find full details and links to where INBRED is playing on the FESTIVALS page.\n\nAlex and INBRED producers Margaret Milner-Schmueck and Yazid Benfeghoul attend the Neuchatel International Fantastic Film Festival is the beautiful town of Neuchatel in Switzerland. INBRED plays at two sold out midnight screenings to a great response. The audience clapped along spontaneously to the Inbred's 'Eee By Gum' song. We would like to thank the festival organisers for a wonderful time.\n\nMore great distribution news has filtered through to us which should please our friends across the North Atlantic... but our lips are sealed.\n\nINBRED has a succesful screening at the SHOCK & GORE FESTIVAL at Birmingham's Electric Cinema. Alex did a Q & A with the cinema's owner Thomas Lawes, who also did the sound mixing on INBRED. A great time was had by all.\n\nJUNE 2012\n\nINBRED distribution deals confirmed! We are very happy to be able to announce that INBRED has been sold to the following territories: UK, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND, SCANDINAVIA and TURKEY. We expect to be able to announce more great news soon.\n\nWe've added more stills from the movie to the PHOTOS page.\n\nThe INBRED deliverables are finally sorted and we can all focus on a promotional push and try and get INBRED sold to as many territories as possible and so it is available to all!\n\nMAY 2012\n\nWe can finally announce that ANCHOR BAY UK are the UK Distributors for INBRED and we are all really happy to be working with them. They have plans for a great INBRED release later this year, in the Autumn, when the nights grow longer. We hope this is just the first of many territory releases of INBRED this year!\n\nINBRED scores in Brazil! INBRED and director Alex attend the FANTASPOA FILM FESTIVAL in Porto Alegre in Brazil. INBRED goes down a storm at two sold out screenings and scoops the BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS award. We'd like to thank the organisers Joao and Nicolas who did an amazing job running this wonderful festival. If you are on FACEBOOK you can see Alex's photos of his trip to Brazil HERE.\n\nINBRED screens at a special showing at THE HORSE HOSPITAL to launch THE HORROR CLUB event run by THE HORROR CHANNEL. Competition winners enjoyed the film in the company of director Alex and stars Dominic Brunt and Emily Booth and also the FRIGHTFEST crew: Paul, Alan, Ian and Greg. The event was hosted by the wonderfully excellent Billy 'Chainsaw' Houlston and was a complete success. The audience loved INBRED. AIN'T IT COOL rates INBRED! Cool!\n\nAPRIL 2012\n\nWork continues on the numerous deliverables and the film festival season kicks off again. INBRED is chosen for 3 festivals which all overlap each other. Alex and producer Yazid Bengeghoul attend the IMAGINE FILM FESTIVAL in Amsterdam, Holland and had a wonderful time thanks to the wonderful festival hosts and the many delights Amsterdam has to offer! A few hours before the INBRED screening whilst sight seeing Alex and Yazid happened across a group of chaps playing folk songs on guitars and fiddles next to a canal. The music reminded Alex of the 'The Inbred Song' in the film and he asked the group if they wanted to help introduce the INBRED screening, in the style of the INBRED song. They agreed and after a very brief rehersal the band arrived at the cinema and helped Alex introduce the film! You can watch film of this on Youtube HERE. The film went down a storm, the band and their famiklies came and watched and enjoyed it too! Thanks to Lawrence and the Band!\n\nWhile that was happening INBRED also screened at HAAPSALU HORROR & FANTASY FILM FESTIVAL in Estonia and also at THE CALGARY UNDERGROUND FILM FESTIVAL in Canada. Both screenings suffered technical difficulties but the organisers were real troopers and heroes and managed to screen the film to very relieved audiences who loved it.\n\nMARCH 2012\n\nLots of hard work still to do as we deliver the INBRED deliverables to Darclight. Alex is busy editing the making of footage into Bonus Featurettes for the DVD and BluRay release of INBRED. We have over 20 hours of behind the scenes materials so the job is very time consuming, but the end results are proving very funny and insightful. Expect some great extras.\n\nWe hear very good news about UK distribution but our lips are sealed until everything is finalised and in the can. The future is bright... the future is INBRED.\n\nFEBRUARY 2012\n\nINBRED is officially 'on the market' for the first time, and screens at EFM, the European Film Market in Berlin to a good reception. Our sales agent, Darclight Films report back that interest was good and it was a positive result.\n\nWe've been told that the film industry is feeling the recession big-time, but despite that INBRED had some very good distribution offers at EFM and deals and negotiations are under way! Great! We can't wait for INBRED to finally be available and seen by people worldwide, and this marks the first early steps... and they are good steps.\n\nThe full INBRED trailer is put online and gets 100,000 hits in two weeks, which is awesome. People really seem to be intrigued by INBRED and we hope and pray they can be patient for a bit longer and help make INBRED the success we all think it deserves.\n\nJANUARY 2012\n\nWe are really pleased to announce that DARCLIGHT FILMS are the International Sales Agent for INBRED. Darclight Films are the horror-arm of Arclight Films. They totally share our ambitions for INBRED and they are going to make sure that it gets seen by as many people in as many countries as is possible!\n\nDarclight's excellent catalogue includes WOLF CREEK (one of Alex Chandon's fave modern horrors), WOLF CREEK 2, BAIT 3D, GRAVE ENCOUNTERS, STORM WARNING, LAKE MUNGO, THE HILLSIDE STRANGLER and many others that can be found on their website HERE\n\nEFM (the European Film Market) is the first big film sales event this year, in Berlin in February, and INBRED is screening and will be heavily promoted. We hope that major distribution deals happen soon after.\n\nThe official, 'proper' INBRED trailer is coming very soon and it will rock!\n\nDECEMBER 2011\n\nThe Festival circuit dies down and serious negotiations about sales agents and distribution for INBRED take hold. The film has caught the eye of quite a few decent world sales agents each with different terms and ideas which need to be mulled over and with INBRED producers in three different time zones the process takes time! INBRED wishes you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2012.\n\nNOVEMBER 2011\n\nThe INBRED producers are deep in talks with world sales agents as INBRED seeks a World Sales agent who shares our belief and ambition with INBRED.\n\nMeanwhile, INBRED continues to have brilliant Festival screenings. The Leeds International Film Festival screening on November 8th was INBRED's Northern premiere, deep in the Yorkshire country we pastiche in the film. If INBRED works it needs to work where it was made... and it did, stupendously. The show was sold out (which led to a 2nd screening a week later!) and the crowd loved it. It had one of the best reactions so far, with every subtle (are not-too subtle) Yorkshire reference getting a hearty laugh. Alex and many cast and crew were there, and the show began with one of the cast (Damien Lloyd Davies) fire breathing outside the cinema!\n\nLeeds was quickly followed by a Friday Night prime-time slot at the up 'n' coming Abetoir Film Festival in lovely and sunny (yes!) Aberystwyth in Wales. INBRED played really well to a small but wonderfully friendly crowd. The guest of honour at the festival was the lovely Victoria Price, daughter of our hero Vincent Price, who gave a wonderful talk about her dad. Vincent rules! Abertoir rocked. Alex has put photographs of his brilliant weekend in 'Aber' on Facebook, HERE.\n\nOCTOBER 2011\n\nBusy week! On Friday 21st INBRED was the Opening Film at Sheffield's CELLULOID SCREAMS FESTIVAL to a sold out crowd and went down a storm, with a great Q and A by the cast. A lovely review by one of the audience can be found HERE. And on the 22nd Alex and Yazid screened the film to 200 horror fans at Yazid's own festival, SPLATTERDAY NIGHT FEVER in Saarbruken, Germany, to a great response. This was followed by Alex's first time in a German nightclub... which he survived with minimal damage! Alex returned to London on the 24th leaving Yazid to travel to Finland to show INBRED at the Night Visions Festival on the 26th. INBRED's tour of duty continues...\n\nOctober 8th. INBRED screens at the wonderful Sitges Film Festival to an amazing audience response. Renowned genre writer Alan Jones wrote in his blog, \"The line to see INBRED snaked all through downtown Sitges and the reception it got was nothing short of phenomenal. The packed audience cheered all the way through, then clapped along with the end theme song while dancing in the aisles.\" Alex and producer Yazid thoroughly enjoyed the festival... and the heat-wave weather. Sitges was a great opportunity to meet fellow filmmakers and 'network' without even trying. We made some great contacts and some great friends. It was a festival to remember. You can see Alex's photos from the festival HERE.\n\nFollowing our test screenings at some film festivals we've remixed and remastered and finalised INBRED and we are very happy with the results. This finished version will premiere at the Sitges Film Festival in sunny Spain which we hear is awesome. INBRED is in the Melies competition and also the Midnight Extreme competition and we've got a good screening date, first film on Saturday midnight.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2011\n\nINBRED screened in sunny Sweden at the Lund Fantastic Film Festival and recieced an honourable mention from the Melies Jury. (We lost out to 'Attack The Block'!) They said \"Alex Chandon and his Inbred is the most violent movie we’ve seen, still it’s one of the most hilarious and unrealistic stupid comedies we’ve seen coming out of Britain in years. And thank you Alex for helping us build up the stereotype of British men and their dental problems. We love you.\" Many thanks to the organisers and guest hosts for looking after us. You can see Alex's photos from the festival HERE.\n\nINBRED had a great screening at the Strasbourg Film Festival. The French loved it. George Romero was there but unfortunately didn't see the film. We would have loved a quote!\n\nFollowing the succesful FRIGHTFEST screenings we have recieved lots of interest from sales agents and distributors and we are in current negotiations to secure ourselves some great people to work with and help bring INBRED to the world. We want to make INBRED available to see, buy and watch as soon as possible, but these deals take a while so in the meantime we will be taking INBRED on a world tour of film festivals and events! Please check out our new FESTIVALS page for details of screenings coming up in the UK, Europe and beyond. The first online reviews are now appearing and we're relieved and happy to see they are looking good. We have links and snippets of these at another new page, REVIEWS .\n\nAUGUST 2011\n\nAll hands were on deck as we worked night and day to get a version of INBRED ready to screen at FRIGHTFEST. We literally finished the day before the festival, so it's been quite a stressful month and that's why we haven't updated the web-site in a while. The grading and the sound were the last things to do and the people we used were all amazing. The wonderful Dado Valentic at Soho post production facility Mytherapy did our grading and mastering. And our brilliant sound mix was orchestrated by Thomas Lawes at The Electric Studios in Birmingham with sound design by Michael Nowacki. Together these three worked absoulte miracles and we are incredibly pleased with the end result. The screening at Frightfest at the 1,200 seater Empire cinema was an epic experience. The film got a brilliant reaction from a packed house of horror fans, with all the cast and crew in attendance. This was the first time anyone, including director Alex Chandon had seen the film play through in its entirety, so there were many first night nerves, but thankfully everything went well and everyone had a chance to relax and rejoice afterwards. A massive thank you must go to FRIGHTFEST (check out their website HERE ) and its wonderful organisers Paul McEvoy, Ian Rattray, Alan Jones and Greg Day. Thank you for making the whole INBRED possee have a great day.\n\nJULY 2011\n\nGreat news! INBRED has been accepted into the prestigious Film 4 FRIGHTFEST FILM FESTIVAL, to be held at the incredible Empire Cinema in Leicester Square, London which seats 1,300 people. Wow. The festival organisers really enjoyed the screener and have given us a great spot as the penultimate film. INBRED screens at 6.30pm on Bank Holiday Monday 29th August 2011. For details of the full FRIGHTFEST line up go to their OFFICIAL WEBSITE. Tickets for individual films go on sale on August 1st. Expect the INBRED cast and crew to turn up in their masses. Everyone is very excited about this.\n\nINBRED has some lovely poster designs which we include in the photo gallery. The striking main promotional artwork is by Daniel Schlüter from Stylewalker Design Media Artworks. We also have had some beautiful teaser posters designed by the talented Silverferox, whose website is HERE.\n\nJUNE 2011\n\nThe INBRED opening scene is finally filmed! This sequence features a cameo from the lovely Emily Booth who has appeared in Alex's last two feature films. Alex says Emily is a good luck charm and he might well be right as the scene went off amazingly well and promises to deliver a knock out opening to INBRED. \"They should have given him the lemonade.\" Indeed.\n\nMARCH 2011\n\nThe massive job of INBRED's visual FX has begun. Having gone through the film we have about 170 shots that require some sort of digital FX work, varying from simple removal of street signs or sky replacement... all the way up to complex 3d motion tracking. These FX shots are digital composite shots, blending real elements to create a seamless end result and avoiding CGI. Our aim is that you won't notice the ammount of clever digital shots in the final film.\n\nFEB 2011\n\nThe INBRED edit stage is finally over. The mammoth job proved harder than anyone envisaged but the end result was worth the effort and the first cut is getting a great response from those who have viewed it. This is just a work print with no sound design or music or digital fx but even so it rocks apparently!\n\nThe INBRED teaser trailer has had a brilliant response, there are now a few versions up on YOUTUBE with total viewings of 50,000, which is very cool and the comments are all encouraging. People are guessing as to what the film is about... and are mostly way off the mark! This will shock and surprise in equal measure we hope.\n\nNOV 2010\n\nINBRED is currently in the initial post production stage. The film is being edited by Olie Griffin and Alex Chandon and word has it that things are coming together nicely. Alex hopes to have a rough cut in December and so then the Digital FX and sound work can begin. The official press release announcing the project is released and a first teaser trailer is made public. This synchronised with a funky update of this site, so you can now watch the trailer here and find out more about the film.\n\nWe are still looking for the right experienced sound designer and a colour grader to help us make INBRED a truly cinematic experience. Use the CONTACT page if you are that person and want to be part of something special.\n\nSEPT 2010\n\nTONS OF THANKS TO ALL WHO HELPED ON THE SHOOT! INBRED looks amazing and that is thanks to the brilliant crew but also the great Yorkshire folks who helped. The film wouldn't have been possible without all the amazing help from the people in Thirsk, Skipton on Swale, Rainton, Thornton-Le-Beans, Northallerton, Rippon, Felixkirk, Huddersfield, Bradford, Leeds, Sheffield, York and more. We all fell in love with Yorkshire and the beautiful countryside and warm, genuine and lovely people there.\n\nThere are too many people to name and thank personally here but you'll all be in the film's credits, but a special mention must go to Michael Sanderson whose incredible generosity and love of horror films was a major factor in the shoots success. His farm was home to Alex Chandon and his assistant director Matt Russell, and he made sure they had fresh eggs every day, and he also built the best car rig and a whole cellar for us, his farm was also one of the main locations. We must also thank the wonderful Irene, landlady extraordinare at the wonderful Ye Olde Three Tuns pub in Thirsk for letting us do dreadfully wonderful things in her pub and letting us have the best Saturday nights most of us can remember (or not in some peoples cases)...\n\nOur open casting day was a great success and we found amazing extras who all performed above and beyond our expectations. Never have so many been so splattered and remained so happy.\n\nPlease join our Facebook page if you haven't already and please spread the word about INBRED and help make this one of the most eagerly anticipated UK horror movies for some time.\n\nLONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH."
