        "text": "The stars: Owen Wilson, Leslie Mann, Troy Gentle, Nate Hartley, David Dorfman.\n\nThe story: Youngsters Ryan (Gentle), Wade (Hartley) and Emmit (Dorfman) are harassed at their first day of High School by bullies and as the days draw on find no escape.\n\nSeeking protection they place an advert in Soldier of Fortune magazine, and end up recruiting seemingly the best (and certainly the cheapest) applicant for the role of bodyguard - Drillbit Taylor (Wilson).\n\nHe sets about training the kids and also poses as a teacher at their school, where he takes a shine to teacher Lisa (Mann).\n\nBut is Taylor all that he seems - and can he help the kids?\n\nThe verdict: Owen Wilson - who hit headlines last year more due to his depression than his bigscreen roles - is back and in terrific form as the good-natured bodyguard in Drillbit Taylor, a choice piece of comedy entertainment that will make you laugh...and possibly even make you cheer!\n\nIt is a classic comedy format - nerdy kids get their revenge on the high school bullies - but delivered with real verve and fun, nicely blending old-fashioned slapstick laughs with bouts of coarser humour.\n\nBut then as Drillbit Taylor originates from the safe-hands team of producer Judd Aptow (who directed Knocked Up) and Seth Rogan (star of Knocked Up and scripter of Superbad) it should all come as no real surprise.\n\nIn fact in some ways the film is similar to Superbad (youngsters win out against the odds) except the age group is somewhat younger.\n\nOwen Wilson is engagingly crazy as the homeless guy who finds himself recruited to help the three kids, and his sweetnatured charm perfectly fits the role of a drifter who despite himself finds himself drawn to the kids and the regularity of school life.\n\nThe fact that he also falls for equally crazed-but-cool teacher Lisa (delightfully played by Leslie Mann - who also happens to be Aptow's real-life wife and starred in Knocked Up) also helps matters.\n\nThe three kids are charmingly played by Troy Gentle, Nate Hartley and David Dorfman, and it says a lot for their own comedy skills that they are not overshadowed by the laid-back laughs that Owen Wilson provides.\n\nScripter Rogan is brilliant at providing the kids with some choice comedy dialogue, and let's face it, the premise is perfect - when you were at school wouldn't you have loved to have been able to hire a soldier of fortune to deal with the school bullies? Of course you would.\n\nFINAL CUT\n\nAn hilarious comedy... Owen Wilson is back on top form."
