        "text": "I'm pleased to announce that we have a new reviewer to CRITICAL CONDITION. His name is Mario Dominick and he wrote all the reviews that you will read below. He emailed asking me to review the following films. I told him that I try to stay away from these films since most of them are shot on video (SOV) and I usually avoid these type of films since they give me headaches or a longing to put a bullet in my brain. I emailed him back and asked if he would like to review the films and put a much-needed new perspective on them since I would probably trash the flicks (at least the ones I have viewed). Surprise of surprises if he didn't take me up on the offer. What you will read below are his takes on the films. Welcome Mario! (All reviews written by Mario will have an \"MD\" after the review.)\n\nAND THEN THEY WERE DEAD (2004)/GUILTY PLEASURES (1997) - Cinema Image Productions brings us a double feature of two fun low budgeters featuring murder, mayhem, madness, blood, sex, and more. AND THEN THEY WERE DEAD is the story of seven strangers who get invited to a dinner party. The characters are your traditional \"Clue\" types (businessman, butler, maid, horny guy, bitchy wife). An unseen assailant begins picking off the sleazy characters one by one quickly turning this into a slasher/who dunit/mystery. Ray Schwetz directs and Joe Zaso, Tina Krause, Darian Caine (who gets murdered while naked in the shower), and Schwetz himself all star. Marcus Koch handled the make-up effects. GUILTY PLEASURES brings us a macabre pair of stories, one directed by Joseph F. Parda and the other directed by Joe Zaso. Two women living in an apartment building are both facing dilemmas that lead to unspeakable horrors. In \"Nocturnal Emissions,\" Silvia Resino (Alexandra Paulhiac) breaks up with her boyfriend. Around the same time, a psycho targeting nude models kills one of her friends. She then begins to receive threatening phone calls, her ex-boyfriend immediately becomes a suspect and a detective (played by Zaso) tries to get her to help him out. Naively thinking the detective is somebody she can trust and will do what's best for her, it leads to a conclusion that makes her sorry she ever got involved with him. \"Method to the Madness\" tells the story of Rosemarie Curtis (Sasha Graham), a pretty young actress in New York City trying to get work. Looking for help with \"method acting,\" she finds an acting coach who she believes will be helpful. Problem is, her friend Monica fears a horrible secret from the past that Rosemarie can't seem to suppress any longer will reveal itself. This makes for a horrifying ordeal involving death and more as it eventually causes Rosemarie's downfall. AND THEN THEY WERE DEAD and GUILTY PLEASURES are both enjoyable B-movie horrors that deliver in gore and nudity and are entertaining in cheesy kind of way. AND THEN, in my opinion, is the better movie of the two, obviously since it was made much later than PLEASURES and it has the better quality and effects. Fans of Joe Zaso, Tina Krause, Darian Caine, and Sasha Graham should definitely add this DVD to their collection. The special features on the AND THEN side of the disc include a commentary with Ray Schwetz and Joe Zaso, a behind-the-scenes documentary, photo gallery, and trailer and the PLEASURES side includes a commentary with Zaso, photo gallery, and trailer.

AT DAWN THEY SLEEP tells the story of two drug lords named Stephen and Ian (Brian Paulin and Rich George) who run into some trouble with one of their rivals and find themselves in the middle of an all-out gang war involving drugs, guns and violence. The two go out looking for adventure one night and bring home a couple of girls who seem normal at first. After sleeping with them, the two wake up in the morning to find the girls gone and they both feel nauseated and can't figure out what happened to them. It so turns out that the girls were angels from the other side and they infected them with a virus that turns them into vampires with a thirst for blood by biting them on the neck. Stephen and Ian both become immortal, join a gang of vampires and are directed to kill and drink the blood of the living so the angels can reclaim the world that they believe belonged to them. Eventually a demon from hell intervenes to stop the angels from having everything all to themselves which results in an action-packed showdown with a supernatural battle between good and evil. AT DAWN THEY SLEEP is a very enjoyable video gore effort. Brian Paulin directed, wrote, stars, co-produced, composed, photographed, edited, did makeup effects and basically handled the whole project single-handedly. The film is loaded with everything you could ask for: gun battles, car crashing, violence, naked females, profanity, cheesy monster outfits and devil makeup, and outrageous and over-the-top gore scenes including beheadings, disembowelments, dismemberments, throats ripped out, brains blown out with guns, heads split with axes, flesh ripping, melting bodies and knives through skulls. In other words, perfect for a Friday night when you have a six pack and get together with your buddies. The Video Outlaw DVD contains many extras such as director's commentary, behind-the-scenes documentary, outtakes, still galleries, a 12-minute short film called DAMNATION and trailers for other Video Outlaw releases. Other movies by Paulin and Morbid Vision include DEAD GIRL ON FILM (2001), MUMMY RAIDER (2002) and BONE SICKNESS (2004). A Video Outlaw DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nTHE ATROCITY CIRCLE (2005) - Ohio's Andrew Copp, creator of THE MUTILATION MAN (1998) and BLACK SUN (2003), brings us this brutal revenge story involving a young man named Brandon (Chris Workman) who's plagued by memories of old high school friends raping a young girl who he had a crush on in a basement while they were getting drunk and playing drinking games. Now married and studying to become a doctor, Brandon does his best to let go of the horrible memories, but they keep getting worse and worse. Eventually Brandon takes it upon himself to track down the now grown-up high school kids who had raped the girl near and dear to him and drove her to suicide and proceeds to bump them off in a variety of extremely brutal and gory ways. Andrew Copp has done a splendid job creating a disturbing and nihilistic film with THE ATROCITY CIRCLE. The acting (especially from Workman) is very good for the most part, the guys playing the rapists do a fine job making the characters come as the sleaziest scum on the planet, and the film doesn't shy away from the red stuff at all as people are tortured, slashed, stabbed in the head, castrated, dismembered, gutted, have their rectums carved out, etc. If you enjoyed AUGUST UNDERGROUND (2001) and MURDER-SET-PIECES (2004), this one should be up your alley. The Apparition Films DVD contains a director's commentary, an outtake and bloopers reel, the original trailer, and trailers for THE MUTILATION MAN and BLACK SUN. With Michelle McLaughlin, Greg Nichols, Thomas Nealeigh, Joe Mackenzie, and Geoff Burkman. Copp and Matt Brassfield appear as rapists. An Apparition Films DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nATTACK OF THE KILLER REFRIGERATOR (1990) - Here's a video that's a true oddity. It's two short films on one tape along with a documentary. First up we have ATTACK OF THE KILLER REFRIGERATOR, a 15 minute short about a group of college kids who get drunk at a party and decide to defrost a refrigerator. The fridge doesn't take too kindly to this and it comes to life and starts killing and eating the kids. One character loses their arm in the door and another is impaled on the handle. The only way to stop this rampaging machine: pull the plug. Next we have THE HOOK OF WOODLAND HEIGHTS, a 40 minute short concerning an escaped psycho who lost one of his hands. He finds his way into the woods near Woodland Heights, gets a hold of a barbeque fork, sticks it on his stump and goes on a gory rampage. Finally, we have a \"making of\" documentary that takes us behind the scenes of WOODLAND HEIGHTS. It also has interviews with the cast and crew, promotional footage, and footage from the movie's screening at a local theater. This video is definitely fun to watch. Both short films from Michael Savino and Mark Veau are humorous, gory, and cheesy as hell. The documentary is very interesting too. If you happen to stumble upon a copy, check it out. A Donna Michelle Productions Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nAUGUST UNDERGROUND (2001)  Looking for something different in the world of low budget filmmaking? Well, look no further than the films of Pittsburghs Fred Vogel and Toe Tag Pictures. This home video classic follows two sick and deranged psychopaths and their adventures torturing and killing people in Southwestern Pennsylvania while one of them films it all with a camcorder. The movie was shot to look like a home movie intentionally. Vogel wanted to portray the world what the world looks like through the eyes of a serial killer. He wanted to give it the look of a snuff film. The film is definitely not for all tastes. Its loaded with extremely graphic sex, rape, torture, gore and full frontally nude women strapped to chairs covered in blood with contusions on their faces and sitting in a pile of their own feces. We are treated to a scene where the killers go into a convenient store, stab the clerk and force a couple of customers to sniff each others assholes. People have their heads hammered in with waffle-nosed claw hammers and we get plenty of graphic scenes with every bodily fluid imaginable. If you want blood, shit, piss, vomit and cum, this certainly delivers it all. Its an incredibly disturbing and offensive movie that I found myself enjoying. AUGUST UNDERGROUND has gained some cult status since it first hit the independent film scene in 2001 and has spawned two sequels, AUGUST UNDERGROUNDS MORDUM (2003) and AUGUST UNDERGROUNDS PENANCE (2007). Vogel also directed REDSIN TOWER (2006) and handled gore effects for Nick Palumbos MURDER-SET-PIECES (2004). Vogel stars along with Allen Peters, Aaron LaBonte, Ben LaBonte, AnneMarie Reveruzzi, Alexa Iris, Victoria Jones, Dan Friedman, Stephen Vogel and Casey Eganey. The Toe Tag Pictures 2-disc DVD has lots of extras including two audio commentaries, a 67-minute documentary called Hammer to the Head: A Closer Look at A.U., a 102-minute Outsiders Perspective called August Underground: Too Real for Comfort, still gallery and more. A Toe Tag Pictures DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nAUGUST UNDERGROUNDS MORDUM (2003)  More gore, rape and torture from Fred Vogels Toe Tag Pictures of the Pittsburgh underground. This sequel follows Vogel again as our main psychopath and a sicko girl who likes to have sex with her brother. Her brother acting as their cameraman follows them on their murder, rape and torture rampage across Pittsburgh. People have their heads bashed in with hammers, throats are slit, our main psycho killers scream and swear at each other a lot throughout most of the film, and in one scene they torture a couple of girls by sticking their fingers down their throats and vomiting on them. This sequel has a little bit more gore than the first one and has the same sickening rape and torture scenes with graphic shots of every bodily fluid imaginable. You dont know what pornographic and disturbing is until you watch this. Vogel co-directed and co-wrote with Jerami Cruise, Killjoy, Mike Schneider and Christie Whiles who all have acting roles. The Toe Tag DVD contains the Necrophagia Rue Morgue Disciple music video, deleted scenes, trailers and a still gallery. A Toe Tag Pictures DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nAUGUST UNDERGROUNDS PENANCE (2007)  The conclusion to the AUGUST UNDERGROUND trilogy once again follows the psychopathic couple from the last film and their adventures with a camcorder as they murder and torture people in Pittsburgh. This is probably the sickest of the series. We get the usual graphic rape, skulls hammered in, slit throats, some disembowelments and dismemberments, masturbation scenes, vomit, girls strapped naked to chairs and having semen smeared on their breasts, our two psychos screaming and swearing at each other, and a family murdered on Christmas. You got to give to Fred Vogel and Toe Tag for making the most outrageous, vile and offensive movies to come out of Pittsburgh. Their true horror fans that know how to keep fans entertained. The Toe Tag DVD of PENANCE contains an audio commentary with the Toe Tag crew, a documentary called Disemboweled: Behind the Bile, extended and deleted scenes, a still gallery slide show, trailers and a couple music videos. Vogel directed and co-wrote with Christie Whiles. They both star together. With Shelby Vogel, Jerami Cruise, Anthony Matthews, Renee Bell, Sara McGill, and Mikol Bell. A Toe Tag Pictures DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nBACK FROM HELL (1993) - Black priest Father Aaron (Shawn Scarbrough) goes to visit his friend Jack (Larry DuBois) who sold his soul to the Devil in hopes of finding fame and fortune in Hollywood. Instead Jack finds himself cursed. Anybody who looks into his eyes becomes possessed into wanting to kill him and he somehow conjures up the spirit of Satan. Aaron tries to help save Jack's soul and the two try to stop the Kingdom of Hell from reigning over the world. In the process they have to go up against a possessed cop, zombies, and hooded satanic cult members with axes. This low budget 16mm effort from director Matt Jaissle is actually better than one might expect. Jaissle keeps up the pace throughout and the movie is never boring. There are some very funny parts (like when a hand comes out of a book and grabs the priest by his nuts) and some extreme gore too. We get an arm stabbed with forks, limbs hacked off, throat slitting, eyes popped out, spilled intestines, bodies cut to pieces, etc. The film is definitely worth checking out. Jaissle and company later made LEGION OF THE NIGHT (1995) and THE NECRO FILES (1997). An HV Films Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nBEAUTY QUEEN BUTCHER (1991) - Deep from the bowels of early '90s shot-on-video mayhem and from the vault of Camp Motion Pictures comes this never-before-released-in-any-format-until-now SOV cheese fest that makes one wonder why a company like Cinema Home Video never picked it up for release back in the day. Phyllis Loden is an overweight, unattractive nerdy high school girl looking to become beautiful like the other girls and win a beauty pageant. Constantly picked on, ridiculed, and teased by a group of snobbish beauty pageant queens, Phyllis desperately looks for a way to change her looks, enter the contest and become the next beauty queen extraordinaire. When one of the nasty beauty pageant bitches decides to get even with Phyllis by doing away with her cat after it caused her to have an allergic reaction, Phyllis decides enough is enough and proceeds to slaughter her pageant tormentors one by one. While BEAUTY QUEEN BUTCHER is a welcome release from Camp and it's nice they came across a lost SOV slasher from 1991, by no means is it a good movie by any stretch of the imagination. One of its biggest problems is that it's too long and could've used better editing. They're really isn't a whole lot of gore on hand either, but one of the few bloody deaths where a girl is stabbed with her beauty pageant crown is kind of amusing. If you're a really big SOV/backyard horror enthusiast, this may be of some interest to you. Just don't expect anything truly memorable or a gorefest that's worth getting up in arms about. This appears to be the only movie director Jill Zurborg ever made. The Camp DVD contains a behind-the-scenes documentary and trailers for other Camp releases. A Camp Motion Pictures DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nBEFORE I DIE (2003)  From Phil Herman and Falcon Video comes the perfect companion piece to HORRORTALES.666 (2003). This time we are presented with three short stories from Joel D. Wynkoop, Sharkey Video and Falcon. The wraparound segment stars Herman as a writer whos suffering from writers block and is basically beating his head against the wall to come up with some new ideas. He comes up with the following three stories. Time for Dessert from Wynkoop Productions stars M. Catherine Holseybrook as a lady with an appetite for men. It so appears that something very sinister lies behind her seductive ways. The men she seduces and takes to a hotel all end up disappearing. An average, bored and horny bachelor looking for adventure hopes he can get lucky and get into bed with Ms. Holseybrook. Unfortunately for him, her dark secret shows itself and he finds himself wishing he would have took his business elsewhere. Last Resort from Sharkey Video stars Dawn Murphy and David Lee as a couple who go to an old resort in the middle of nowhere for a honeymoon. It appears they havent seen THE SHINING (1980) enough to know to stay away from resorts that have a bad history and have been abandoned for good reason. The spirits or whatever it is that inhabit the place send them messages that they want them out. After getting out of there, Lee learns something about the resorts past that may change his life forever. Someone Is Sleeping In My Bed from Herman and Falcon starts off with a couple mischievous trick-or-treaters being bumped off by a masked psychopath. We are then introduced to a woman played by the lovely Nancy Feliciano who is stalked by the psycho in her home. The ending to this story (which I wont give away) comes as a surprise that somehow ties it to the wraparound and kind of reprises the first segment of HORRORTALES.666. Youll have to see it for yourself. BEFORE I DIE is another nice collection of short films from three of the hottest independent producers on the underground scene. While it doesnt seem to rely as much on the T&A as others of its ilk, it does have enough steamy moments to keep the perverts entertained. As for graphic violence and bloodletting, gorehounds may find it kind of dry. But its still something bad movie fans and connoisseurs of zero budget horror should eat up nonetheless. For fans of Nancy Feliciano and Dawn Murphy, this is definitely the perfect treat for you. Written and directed by Dave Castiglione, Dawn Murphy, Phil Herman and Joel D. Wynkoop. Wynkoop has a part as one of Holseybrooks victims in the first segment. With Gusto Perez, Kevin Bangos, Chris Hurban, and Brock Richards. A Falcon Video Release. Available on DVD as a part of the Pendulum Pictures DECREPIT PIT OF NIGHTMARES 50-Movie Set from Brain Damage Films. Unrated -MD\n\nBITS AND PIECES (1985) - A psychopath named Arthur (S.E. Zygmont) is stalking women and slaughtering them with various tools. It turns out that his mother abused him when he was a child and now he hates women. That's usually the case with these movies. A police lieutenant (Brian Burt) tries to stop him while developing a relationship with one of the victim's friends (Susanna Smith). There's not that much to recommend about this one, though it is a very corny movie and has some occasional funny moments (like when Arthur bumps into a guy and the guy says, \"Watch where you're going apple ass!\"). There is some nudity and a fair amount of bloodshed but not a whole lot of graphic gore. This is director Leland Thomas's only movie. The cinematography is by Thomas Callaway who went on to photograph many genre movies including ones by Charles Band and David DeCoteau. If you like MANIAC (1980) or THE LOVE BUTCHER (1975) you may find some enjoyment in this. With Sheila Lussier, Tally Chanel, Elaine Bartolone, and Sandy Brooke. A Trans World Entertainment Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nBLACK DEVIL DOLL FROM HELL (1984) - This early shot on video effort is definitely one of the weirdest films I've ever seen for sure. Directed by Chester Novell Turner on a budget of about 32 cents. It stars Shirley L. Jones as a religious black woman who goes into a magic shop and buys a strange black voodoo doll puppet. It seems that the doll somehow always finds its way back to store the day after somebody buys it. She starts hallucinating about the doll having sexual encounters with her. Eventually the doll comes to life, knocks her unconscious, ties her to a bed, and begins to sexually molest her. She then begins to enjoy it and the doll says things like \"I'm going to pop your cherry bitch!\" and \"Beg for it bitch!\" The next day the doll mysteriously disappears. Jones then tries relationships with other men, but they can't seem to fulfill her desires like the doll did. She then goes back to the store to buy it again but soon finds out the doll has something evil in mind. Mere words cannot describe this movie. I'd say it's in a class of its own. There's lots of nudity and obscene language and the movie is guaranteed to offend. The acting is pretty bad and the photography is washed out and has the look of a poorly shot porn movie. The Casio keyboard music score, however, is very good. I really liked the rock song that plays over the opening and end credits. I'd have a hard time recommending this to anybody who doesn't watch anything beyond the mainstream movies, but if you're adventurous, a bad movie fan and a shot on video enthusiast, this should be right up your alley. Mr. Turner also wrote and produced. He composed the score too. He later made a movie called TALES FROM THE QUADEAD ZONE (1987), another shot on video feature. A Hollywood Home Theatre Release. Unrated - MD\n\nBLOOD FOR THE MUSE (2001) - Terry M. West brings us one of his best efforts with this black and white film noire- esque gore film about a video store clerk named Josh (Josh Robinson) and his obsession with the \"Muse of Tragedy,\" a mythic figure and apparent goddess long believed to appear when tragedies strike. He decides to keep this goddess alive by going out and finding call girls and brutally hacking them to death. He meets up with college student Sara (Tina Krause) whom he falls in love with. His mission to keep killing to keep the Muse alive soon interferes with his ability to form a romantic relationship with Sara leaving him torn between which is more important, the Muse or Sara? BLOOD FOR THE MUSE is a beautifully shot, disturbing feature with plenty of graphic murders, nudity and sex. With a cast featuring Tina Krause, Pamela Sutch, Ruby LaRocca, Deana Enoches, and adult film actress Tammy Parks, some stylish scenery, and a beautiful music score, there's certainly much to enjoy. Terry M. West wrote, directed, executive produced, edited and makes an appearance in the film himself. Currently available on DVD as a bonus feature on the Shock-O-Rama release of SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR LUST (2002), BLOOD FOR THE MUSE is soon to be available on DVD as an \"Omega Edition\" from West's Pleasant Storm Entertainment label. A Dark Muse Films VHS Release. Unrated - MD\n\nBLOOD LAKE (1987) - Best known as one of the shittiest of the '80s SOV slashers, BLOOD LAKE features a group of teens who travel out to a lakeside house for a summer vacation and are soon being picked off one by one by a fat, country bumpkin-looking knife-wielding psychopath. It features hilarious overacting, some really crappy gore effects, a shot of a spider crawling on a ceiling (thrown in for no apparent reason), and an ending that makes no sense whatsoever. As bad as it is, it's still very entertaining in a weird sort of way. It's an absolute must-see for all bad movie fanatics. Directed by Tim Boggs from a script by producer Doug Barry who also stars. With Angela Darter, Mike Kaufman, Andrea Adams, Travis Krasser, Christie Willoughby, and Tiny Frazier. A United Entertainment VHS Release. Not yet available on legitimate DVD. Not Rated - MD\n\nTHE BLOOD SHED (2007) - Indie genius Alan Rowe Kelly brings us this tale about an inbred New Jersey backwoods cannibalistic redneck family named the Bullions. Papa Elvis Bullion (Terry M. West) looks after his kids led by Beefteena (played by Kelly) along with Butternut (Joshua Nelson) and Hubcap (Mike Lane) and their friend Sno Cakes (Susan Adriensen) as they capture and kill folks who become a nuisance to them. Among those unfortunate are an obnoxious kid who gets pulled in half, the local police officer who has his nuts squashed with pliers, and people from a fashion photo studio who end up as guests at the most hellish dinner party ever filmed. Watch as the wacky Bullion family argues and bickers, spies on their neighbors, and strike at their enemies in gruesome fashion. THE BLOOD SHED is a movie well worthy of cult status and the current following it has in the underground horror scene. Alan Rowe Kelly in drag makes Beefteena Bullion one of the most twisted horror characters ever conceived. I look forward to Kelly's upcoming anthology GALLERY OF FEAR (2009). Be sure to check out his first feature I'LL BURY YOU TOMORROW (2002) as well. Extras on the Heretic Films DVD of THE BLOOD SHED include a commentary with Kelly, a behind-the-scenes montage, trailer, and cast bios. With Jerry Murdock, Zoe Daelman Chlanda, Katherine O'Sullivan, and Michael Gingold. A Heretic Films DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nTHE BLOODY VIDEO HORROR THAT MADE ME PUKE ON MY AUNT GERTRUDE (1989) - Micro budget horror guru Zachary Winston Snygg started off his career with this incredibly cheesy, low quality, backyard camcorder affair with a 12-word title concerning a gangster who shoots himself a snuff film for a racketeering enterprise, but to his dismay, accidentally returns the video camera he rented to the video store with the tape of the murder still in it. Murder, mayhem, deceit, and double crosses ensue as he tries to retrieve his tape. Shot with very little money and it certainly shows. There are lots of laughable gore effects on display, overacting, corny humor, credits printed on typewriter paper, and more. If really cheesy home movies are your cup of tea, you can't go wrong with this. A Video Outlaw Release. Unrated - MD\n\nBONE SICKNESS (2004)  This shot on video gore classic from Brian Paulin and Morbid Vision Films tells the story of a guy with a degenerative bone diseases whos being cared for by his wife whos desperately trying to find a cure. She enlists the help of his friend who thinks he has a cure. Having a lot of experience in the medical field, this friend robs the graves of a cemetery taking bones and other parts. He grinds up the body parts to form a medication that can cure the bone disease. Only problem is, the dead buried in the cemetery dont take to kindly to being robbed by grave robbers and they come back as flesh hungry zombies that cause chaos on a level unseen since Peter Jacksons DEAD ALIVE (a.k.a. BRAINDEAD  1992). Brian Paulin has created an indie horror masterpiece with BONE SICKNESS. It could quite possibly be the goriest American-made independent zombie movie in over a century! We get people barfing and shitting worms and maggots, beheadings, dismemberments, exploding heads, guts pulled out through asses, spinal cords ripped out, people sawed in half, heads squashed with tombstones, heads ripped in half, brain spilling, innards spilling, intestine and throat munching, people melting and exploding, brains squashed out of heads, etc. To sum up BONE SICKNESS in a word: Outfuckingstanding! Ive become a loyal Morbid Vision fan after seeing this one. I cant wait to see their new movie FETUS (2007). The Unearthed Films DVD contains some cool extras including audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes, bloopers, an interview with Paulin, still gallery and more. Paulin wrote, produced, directed, edited, composed, acts, and handled the make-up effects. With Darya Zabinski, Ruby LaRocca, Rich George, Kevin Barbare, and Ernest Hutcherson. An Unearthed Films DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nTHE BRIDE OF FRANK (1996)  Very low quality and totally whacked out horror comedy borrowing elements from John Waters and Troma movies. A wrinkled old bum named Frank is hired to work in a New Jersey warehouse. Frank is hard to understand at times and we are provided with subtitles on occasion. His co-workers give him everything he wants. They take him to a strip club one nigh t and he decides he wants a woman. His friends promise to get him one. He says he wants tits which turns out to be the only thing hes interested in. The movie consists of Frank calling phone sex lines and getting his friends to send him hookers until he finds the perfect woman. When people get on Franks bad side, he threatens them with Ill bite your dick off! or Ill cut off your head and shit down your throat! or Ill rip out your eye and skull fuck you to death! Frank keeps all his promises as he bites off a drug dealers dick, knocks a nerds head off and shits down his neck, rips a cross dressers face off, shoves a knife up underneath a fat girls chin and through her mouth, smacks an 8-year-old girl on the head with a pipe and runs over her head with a trailer truck, and yanks out a whores eye and screws her brains out through the eye socket. The movie goes out of its way to offend everybody. Its loaded with gratuitous sex, T&A, vulgarity, fart and booger jokes, and cheap gore. The only other thing director Steve Ballot (using the name Escalp Don Blade) has done to date is a small part in Howard Sterns PRIVATE PARTS (1997). THE BRIDE OF FRANK appears to have been shot on Super 8. It never had an official distributor for a good many years. The only way you could obtain a copy of the film was through bootlegging outlets. Sub Rosa Studios recently released it on DVD. This is the first time its ever been officially available in the US. The DVD contains many extras including audio commentary, deleted scenes, alternate ending, promotional materials, trailers, hidden bonuses and more. With Morgan Tara, Frank Meyer, Johnny Horizon, Victor Delvalle, Bruce Frankel, Jim Moresca, Rena Ballot, Arnell Dowret, Steve Ballot, Eric Kaplan, Eddie Regan, Sal Mogavero, Bernard Briley, and Sergio Lopez.

Kunkle is having problems with seeing the ghosts of the people who he murdered in the first film. He gets depressed and slowly becomes suicidal. He then meets up with a teenage girl nerd named Thelma Crump (Heidi Lohr). Thelma is being harassed in high school by her classmates and wants to be with somebody who likes her for what she is. She then begins a relationship with Harold. Thelma's classmates who picked on her tell her they want to make it up to her by inviting her to a party. They invite Harold as well. After the two find out that they were invited to the party to be humiliated in front of the whole senior class, they get their revenge by slaughtering all the kids. Thelma castrates a guy with her teeth and Harold breaks his neck. Before stabbing a girl in car, Thelma says, \"I'm going to slice you up and then I'm going to pee on you!\" A girl is stabbed in the shower. One guy is impaled on a stick and another has his throat gorily slashed. Before proceeding to kill another girl, Thelma remarks, \"You have nice breasts. I'm going to lop them off and stuff them in my bra. Then I'll have big titties too!\" I think I enjoy this sequel even more than the original. This one has even more humorous dialogue and it has a better story. I can't wait for the day when Wayne Alan Harold and Mark Steven Bosko make SON OF KILLER NERD! A Riot Pictures Video Release. Available on DVD from Troma as a double feature with the first KILLER NERD. Not Rated - MD\n\nBURGLAR FROM HELL (1993)  Thief Frank the Tank (Bryant Sohl) breaks into an apartment complex, beats up an old lady, and proceeds to take money shes hiding in a pillow. After finding the money and proceeding to make off with the goods, the old lady gets a shotgun, blows him away and buries him in the backyard. A couple friends get together with some black dudes to spend the night at a friends apartment. One black girl staying with them is into witchcraft. She gets them all together to hold a séance and she accidentally ends up resurrecting Frank the Tank. He rises from his grave as a zombie that goes through several different stages of rot (with gooey disintegrating flesh make-up) and proceeds to have his revenge and kill anybody who gets in his way. Gory mayhem ensues. BURGLAR FROM HELL is a fun shot-on-video gore comedy from Phil Herman who would go on to do the JACKER movies and the MIDNIGHT trilogy. The film has a fine B-movie cast including Barry Gaines, Ben Stanski, Nancy Feliciano, and Debbie D (who goes topless in a few scenes). Frank the Tank rips a guys throat out with his bare hands in the beginning before he becomes a zombie. A guy has his arm ripped off and is beaten to death with it. One guy has his head punched clean off. Before doing away with Debbie D, Franks penis rots off and he says, Oh, my peepee! Guess I dont have any use for you anymore. The sickest scene in the movie is a part where a guy is on the toilet with diarrhea and Frank comes in with a shovel, sticks it in the guys stomach and cuts his bowels open and drains and eats the digested food out of him while its going through his system as he takes a shit. I got a really putrid acid vomit taste in my mouth during this part. Another sick part is when a guy gets boiled alive by scalding hot water in shower stall. If youre in the mood for something thats cheap, gross, sleazy and gory, this is the perfect movie to pop in the machine on a boring and rainy afternoon. A Falcon Video Release. Unrated MD\n\nCAMP BLOOD (1999) - Here we go. Another videotaped slasher-trash flick. This one seems to be somewhat of a cult favorite amongst fans of these types of movies (myself included). Four college kids get together for the weekend and go on a trip to Camp Blackwoods. They run into a tough-talking woman named Harris who turns out to be their guide. After getting their campsite set up in the woods, Harris tells them a story around the campfire about a guy who killed his wife and her lover after finding them in bed together. A legend that the clown mask-wearing killer still roams the woods won't seem to go away. Soon enough, they wake up the next morning to find the body of what appears to be Harris burnt to a crisp on the campfire wood. One of them suspects that it's the clown killer so they decide to get their asses out of the woods. Soon they have a run-in with the clown boy with a machete. One girl sprains her ankle trying to get away. One guy tries to be a hero and take on the killer himself. And one guy accidentally kills his wounded girlfriend thinking she's the killer. After they've all been bumped off, it's down to the heroine to have the final showdown with clown boy. While it's certainly nothing new (and the killer's identity becomes very obvious almost less than halfway through), the film does have its moments. There are some decent gore scenes as well and a little nudity and sex at the beginning. You can tell FRIDAY THE 13TH (1980) is what really inspired the people who made this. The ending kind of reminds you of the ending of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (1974). Writer-Director Brad Sykes made CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000) after this. His other films include EVIL SISTER 2 (2001), DEATH FACTORY (2002), LORD OF THE VAMPIRES (2002) and GOTH (2003). David Sterling produced and Jeff Leroy edited and handled the videography. With Jennifer Ritchkoff, Michael Taylor, Tim Young, Betheny Zolt, Courtney Taylor, Joseph Haggerty, Meredith O'Brien, Vinnie Bilancio, Ron Ford and Tim Sullivan. A Burning Moon Home Video Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nCAMP BLOOD 2 (2000) - If you couldn't get enough of a machete-wielding psycho clown killer chopping up youngsters in the woods, the great Brad Sykes brings to you CAMP BLOOD 2! Tricia (Jennifer Ritchkoff), the survivor from the first movie returns. After being locked away in a mental institution after going crazy from the horrible bloodbath in the woods and being thought by many to have been the killer, Tricia is approached by a sleazy filmmaker who wants to make a BLAIR WITCH (1999)-style movie about her experience. She agrees to be a technical advisor on the film crew. Once the crew gets set up in the woods and starts filming, one of them disappears and doesn't come back. They start to wonder what's going on. Soon it turns out that another clown-masked killer is on the loose and the crew starts getting picked off one by one in various gory ways. This one's just about on the same level as the first one. Lots of blood, a little T&A, some cheesy dialogue and you know who the killer is before the show is half over. If you're planning an evening of getting drunk with your friends and you need something to laugh at watch CAMP BLOOD 1, 2&3 (WITHIN THE WOODS [1999 - 2005]) back to back. You might have fun. David Sterling produced (again) and Jeff Leroy was the editor and photographer. With Courtney Burr, Brannon Gould, Natascha Corrigan, Ken X, Tim Sullivan, Lisa Marie Bolick, Garrett Clancy, Missy Rae Hansen and Mark Overholt. A Spectrum Films Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nCANNIBAL CAMPOUT (1988) - I must say, I'm a much bigger shot on video enthusiast than most people are. I think this videotaped gore fest from Jon McBride could quite possibly be my all-time favorite shot on video movie. It would make a good double bill with Pericles Lewnes' REDNECK ZOMBIES (1987). CANNIBAL CAMPOUT concerns a group of college friends who go on an outing for the weekend in the backwoods of New Jersey. It appears as though a trio of demented redneck cannibal killers are stalking the woods and brutally slaughtering and eating campers. The film has funny dialogue, amusingly cheesy moments, and lots of extreme gore. There's a machete through the brain, machete to the throat, axe in the head, dismemberment, disembowelment, gut munching, etc. The opening murder of a girl jogging alongside a road seemingly comes out of nowhere and is very shocking. The fetus scene near the end is really sick (\"A womb with a view.\"). I noticed that all the characters seem to share the same first name with the actors playing the parts. McBride stars along with Amy Chludzinski, Christopher Granger, Richard Marcus, Gene Robbins, Carrie Lindell, and Joseph Salheb. McBride made WOODCHIPPER MASSACRE (1988) after this and is now making movies with the Polonia brothers. A Donna Michelle Productions Release. Unrated - MD NOTE: I finally relented and bought a copy of this film off of Mario. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the acting is strictly one-note (except for the cannibal who wants to fuck the girls before he eats them!), the effects are above-par for a SOV feature, the retarded cannibal wears a flight suit complete with helmet and oxygen mask and there are several moments of real suspense. Jon McBride (who co-directed and co-produced this feature with one-shot wonder Tom Fisher and wrote it under the pseudonym \"John Rayl\") went completely downhill after this one as all his other films will bear me out (even though Mario may disagree with me). This is actually a good SOV film, especially if you are under the influence of a controlled substance and with a bunch of friends. - Editor. Available on DVD in early 2007 from Camp Motion Pictures.\n\nCHAINSAW SALLY (2004) - Filmmaker Jimmy O Burril along with Redfield Arts bring us a new take on the often used TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (1974)-style formula in the horror genre with this bloody and humorous grade B low budgeter. Sally (April Monique Burrill, wife of director Jimmy O) is a librarian with a dark past and a murderous side that takes over at night. She along with her transvestite brother Ruby (Alec Joseph) both witnessed their parents (their father played by the original \"Leatherface\" Gunnar Hansen in the flashbacks) murdered by three intruders in their home before saving each other by killing the intruders in self-defense when they were youngsters. Sally targets her enemies with the help of Ruby by doing away them in a variety of gruesome ways, the chainsaw being the device used most frequently. Businessman Steve Kellerman (Mark Redfield) who becomes friends with Sally is interested buying the land where Sally and Ruby used to live as youngsters and where they witnessed the murder of their parents. When Steve and the landlord get on Sally's bad side, she soon unleashes her fury on them, making them experience a horror that they won't soon forget. CHAINSAW SALLY is a very fun picture that delivers in gore and campy humor with a touch of old fashioned \"trailer trash\" horror. Burrill does a fine job in the lead role and her husband Jimmy is a talented director who really knows the horror genre and manages to be very creative. There are some really nasty death scenes including multiple chainsaw slayings and dismemberments, a bloody castration, and a sick torture scene with a girl having acid dumped down her throat causing her guts to spill out her ass and into a bucket. The \"Godfather of Gore\" Herschell Gordon Lewis even makes a cameo appearance himself. It's a very twisted film that delivers. I look forward to seeing the sequel that is in the works right now as we speak. Shock-O-Rama's DVD of SALLY contains a good amount of extras including a commentary with Jimmy and April, a behind-the-scenes featurette entitled \"Saw Dust: The Making of Chainsaw Sally,\" a music video, Gunnar Hansen and H.G. Lewis interviews, an artwork gallery, trailer, and trailers for other Shock-O-Rama releases. With David R. Calhoun, Kristen Hudson, Aaron Martinek, Brad Smoley, and Suzi Lorraine. A Shock-O-Rama Cinema DVD Release. Rated R - MD NOTE: Believe it or not, this film spawned an internet-based show presented by Hershell Gordon Lewis and starring April Monique Burrill as Chainsaw Sally. It lasted for two seasons, from 2009 to 2011. - Editor\n\nCITY IN PANIC (1987) - This Canadian slasher concerns a radio talk show host and detectives who try to track down a psycho in a black suit and hat who's slicing up people with AIDS (both homosexual and heterosexual) in a big city. The killer gets to be known as \"M\" because he carves the letter M onto the bodies of all his victims. Most people I've talked to hate this movie, but I'm one of the few who actually liked it. I thought the idea of a killer targeting people with AIDS was something a little different for the slasher genre. The killings are very graphic and gory and include some splashy slashings and stabbings, a PSYCHO (1960) shower scene at the beginning, a male stripper being repeatedly mowed down by a van in an alley, and a scene where a security guard sticks his wang through a hole in a bathroom stall and the killer hacks it off sending blood spraying everywhere. The film is definitely not for those with weak stomachs. With David Adamson, Leeann Westegard, and Ed Chester. Directed by Robert Bouvier. A Trans World Entertainment Release. Available from Brain Damage Films under the title 13. Not Rated - MD\n\nCRADLE OF FEAR (2001) - A British shot-on-video horror anthology from UK underground goremeister Alex Chandon (BAD KARMA - 1991, DRILLBIT - 1992, PERVIRELLA - 1997, NIGHT PASTOR - 1998, and INBRED - 2011) that is an extreme, in-your-face gore-filled thrill-ride starring Dani Filth of Cradle of Filth as \"The Man.\" The Man is a super nasty revenge spirit called upon by an incarcerated serial killer to seek brutal vengeance on the people who brought about his imprisonment. The Man is the link connecting four gruesome stories, the first one concerning a woman who has a date with what turns out to be a demon from hell. The next day she suffers hallucinations leading up to a bloody conclusion involving the birthing of the demon's grotesque offspring. The second concerns two lesbian thieves who break into an old man's apartment and end up killing him in the process of the robbery. Their plan to make off with his loot then backfires in a rather messy way. The third concerns an amputee who, after losing his leg in an accident, thinks he's discovered a miracle by finding a way for a doctor to give him a new leg, only this gift turns out to be the ultimate curse. The fourth concerns a businessman who becomes obsessed with a vile porn/sadism/torture website. He can't stop viewing the site and using its \"create your snuff film\" feature. The site ends up costing him his job and his home as his situation soon turns into a horrific nightmare made reality in which he cannot escape. CRADLE OF FEAR is a terrific low budget gorefest from Alex Chandon who you can tell through and through is a dedicated splatter fan. British scream queen Eileen Daly stars as Natalie. There's plentiful nudity and gore effects that rival that of Olaf Ittenbach's work, including dismemberments, disembowelments, heads ripped apart, creatures erupting from stomachs, and much more. If gushing blood sprays, demons, and sick creature effects are what you're looking for, look no further than CRADLE OF FEAR. The DVD extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, stills gallery and trailers. An Image Entertainment DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nCRINOLINE HEAD (1995) - A group of obnoxious teenagers go out to a cabin in the woods for a vacation. One tells a story about a kid who cannibalized his mother at the place years ago when the food supply ran out. The kid ended up in an institution and kept a crinoline skirt that his mother was making for a baby doll. You know where this all leads to, right? We end up with a psycho wearing a crinoline skirt on his head stalking and killing the dumb kids one by one. As far as low budget slasher comedies go, this one isn't too bad. While there isn't any nudity and not a whole lot of gore, the film is still pretty entertaining for what it is. There's a funny death by celery scene and a scene where a girl is drowned in a toilet and her corpse is later seen with feces smeared on the face. There are some pretty good bands on the soundtrack and the VHS contains a music video after the movie. Director Tommy Faircloth made GENERATION AX (1998) after this. With Brian Kelly, Tommy Faircloth, Tracy Powlas, Cathy Slaminko, and Liz Taheri. A Scorpio International Ltd. Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nCUTTING MOMENTS (1997) - Perhaps the most professionally done film I've ever reviewed for this section of this website. Douglas Buck is a filmmaker from Canada who's become well-known for his 2006 remake of Brian DePalma's SISTERS (Buck's version stars Chloe Sevigny and Stephen Rea) and his contributing a segment to the recent horror anthology THE THEATRE BIZARRE (2011) (one that also features segments by Tom Savini, Buddy Giovinazzo (COMBAT SHOCK - 1986), Richard Stanley (HARDWARE - 1990), Karim Hussain (SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - 2000), David Gregory (PLAGUE TOWN - 2008), and Jeremy Kasten (THE WIZARD OF GORE - 2007)). He is also known for his intense and dramatic anthology feature FAMILY PORTRAITS: A TRILOGY OF AMERICA (2003) which features CUTTING MOMENTS along with his other shorts HOME (1998) and PROLOGUE (2003). Here we will take a look at what I feel is the best of the FAMILY PORTRAITS trilogy. CUTTING MOMENTS starts off with a young boy playing with Power Rangers dolls in his front yard while his father is focused on trimming the bushes with hedge clippers. Both very quiet characters, the father comes up to the boy and is immediately disturbed by the position in which he sees the toys laying on the ground and proceeds to pick them up. Later on, the boy, father and mother are all shown eating dinner. The mother asks the boy how school was. The kid doesn't seem interested in talking at all and is anxious to leave the table. Something appears to be very wrong with this seemingly normal family. The mother is having the worst possible suspicions about the father and son's relationship. She seems to want her husband to notice her more. One day, she dresses up in a pretty red dress with lipstick and make-up to get him to take an interest in her, but he continues to watch sports on TV. This seems to trigger a psychotic episode in the mother as she goes into her bathroom and wipes off her lipstick. What then proceeds is one of the most graphic scenes of self-mutilation ever committed to celluloid. She mutilates her lips with a wiry bathroom brush and slices off what's left of her lips with a pair of scissors. After this horrific act of self-inflicted torture, she then finally gets the attention of her husband, leading to a gory murder-suicide during sex between the couple as the husband does away with what's left of their sexual organs with the help of his own hedge clippers. The son is thus left an orphan in the end. CUTTING MOMENTS has been called one of the most disturbing movies ever and it's one that certainly lives up to its hype. Shot on 16mm by Douglas Buck, the film quickly became a favorite of many film festivals and Buck as a director has received praise from many of extreme cinema's most prominent figures such as Abel Ferrara (THE DRILLER KILLER - 1979, MS. 45 - 1981) and Gaspar Noe (I STAND ALONE - 1998, IRREVERSIBLE - 2003). CUTTING MOMENTS is often seen played alongside other disturbing horror shorts like Nacho Cerda's AFTERMATH (1994) and Mitch Davis's DIVIDED INTO ZERO (1999). First released on VHS by Alternative Cinema on their Shock-O-Rama line as part of a short films compilation (also called CUTTING MOMENTS), the film then got its best treatment when released on DVD by Home Vision Entertainment as part of the FAMILY PORTRAITS anthology. When you watch the shorts on the DVD in the order in which Buck filmed them, each short actually gets progressively less horrific with HOME being a similar disturbing drama, but not being anywhere near as graphic and when you finally get to PROLOGUE it's mostly a straight-up drama and not horror at all. Whichever you like best, you can definitely agree Buck is an underrated director and talent to be reckoned with. Tom Savini consulted on some of the effects on CUTTING MOMENTS. The Image/Home Vision 2-disc DVD of FAMILY PORTRAITS contains the three separate shorts with director's commentary on the first disc and the three shorts cut together as a feature anthology film on the second disc with extras including behind-the-scenes footage, still galleries, trailers, another early short film from Buck, and more. FAMILY PORTRAITS is a Home Vision/Image Entertainment DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nDARK CRAVING (1993) - John A. Russo, writer of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) and director of MIDNIGHT (1980), brings us this low budget Pittsburgh-shot adaptation of his novel \"The Awakening.\" The film opens with Benjamin Latham (Kevin Kindlin), an 18th century physician being hanged after being accused of being a vampire. He is resurrected in modern day Pittsburgh and comes out of his grave in a construction field naked. After finding some clothes and finding his way into society, he meets up with a priest and confesses that he was hanged as a vampire back in 1776 but in order for him to stay alive in the present time, he must kill and drink blood. A rash of killings ensue all over town in which victims are found with poisonous saliva in their bloodstreams. Lt. Vargo (Tom Savini), whose daughter was murdered years before, is trying to solve the murders. Latham meets up with a female zoo curator (played by Moon Unit Zappa) and falls in love with her. Meanwhile, a series of copycat killings occur where victims have their blood drained from their bodies. It appears the culprit behind these murders is somebody who wants to be immortal like Benjamin. This leads to a climactic battle between vampire and human monster. DARK CRAVING (originally released on VHS by Tempe Video as HEARTSTOPPER) is, for the most part, a half-decent film. Tom Savini gives a fine performance as the police lieutenant. The film, however, has a tendency to drag in some places. In fact there were moments when I felt like I was drifting off to sleep. On the other hand, there are some decent make-ups and blood effects by Savini, Jerry Gergely and Greg Funk, and the locations in Pittsburgh that were used seem to work very well. I haven't read Russo's original novel that this is based on, so I really couldn't do a comparison, but overall the film is a fairly enjoyable low budgeter. Michael J. Pollard is featured in a cameo as \"Dr. Lubbock.\" The original Tempe VHS under the title HEARTSTOPPER features the B's Nest Video Magazine after the movie featuring interviews with Russo and Savini, a horror merch promo spot with Jeannie Jeffries Brown, and Tempe trailers including a trailer for Bill Hinzman's THE MAJORETTES (1986). The Shriek Show DVD contains a making-of featurette, interviews with Russo and make-up effects artist Jerry Gergely, the original soundtrack, photo gallery, and the original trailer. A Shriek Show DVD Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nDARKEST SOUL (1994) - Two young punks Tommy and Mark (Al Darago and Jeff Witte), constantly getting fired from jobs at fast food places and grocery stores, are hired to dig graves at a cemetery. The two are satisfied with the job but they want more money. They decide to start stealing jewelry off the corpses so they can sell them to get money. Mark starts shooting up on drugs and his addiction leads to unfortunate results for both him and Tommy. Though labeled as a horror movie, I'd have a hard time calling this zero budget video quickie \"horror.\" It's more of a drama focusing on two characters and how shitty their lives are. The only real horror scenes come at the end. The film is too boring and depressing to be of much interest. If you like movies put out by Sub Rosa, then this might be an okay way to kill 65 minutes, but there are better Sub Rosa flicks like SAVAGE HARVEST (1994), GUT-PILE (1997), and MEAT MARKET (2000). Director Doug Ulrich wrote and produced with Al Darago. Ulrich and Darago made SCREEN KILL (1997) after this. A Salt City Home Video Release. Unrated - MD\n\nDARKNESS (1993) - Here's a vampire movie that's certainly not your average vampire story. In the beginning a young man witnesses a bloody massacre in a convenient store at the hand of a vampire. He finds himself on the run as the community is besieged by bloodsuckers and has to fight to survive. He arms himself with various weapons and tries to fight the lead vampire Livens with other survivors. This low budget Super 8 gore fest from Leif Jonker is probably one of the best Super 8 movies I've seen. It's almost on par with J.R. Bookwalter's THE DEAD NEXT DOOR (1988). The film is very dark most of the time but I think that adds more to the atmosphere. It's definitely one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. The vampires in this one are more like zombies almost. We get throat rippings with jugular fountains, blood spraying everywhere, and an amazingly bloody finale where all the vampires begin to melt and explode in the sunlight. It's an absolute nonstop chunk blower. Highly recommended. With Gary Miller (who also did the effects), Michael Gisick, Randall Aviks, Cena Donham, and Steve Brown. A Film Threat Video Release. Unrated - MD NOTE: Also available as a 2 disc DVD from Barrel Entertainment. - Editor\n\nDEADBEAT AT DAWN (1988) - Jim VanBebber's low budget masterpiece is easily one of the all time greatest independent films and one of the most brutal movies ever made. VanBebber stars as Goose, a gang member in Dayton, Ohio who's forced to quit the gang by his girlfriend. His fellow gang members don't take too kindly to this. Danny and the Ravens, a gang leader and gang Goose's gang has been going up against, send a couple of their toadies out to kill Goose's girlfriend. After finding his girl's bloody, brutally bludgeoned and eviscerated corpse in his apartment, this completely pushes him over the edge. We watch as he goes out trying to get money from his low life, junkie father and goes to bars and gets drunk. At one point Goose contemplates suicide, only to be found and picked up by one of his fellow gang members who were a little peeved at him for leaving the gang. It turns out they have teamed up with Danny and the Ravens and they try to use Goose to help them with an armored car robbery. After agreeing to go along with this, Goose still hasn't forgotten about what they did to his girl and plots his brutal revenge against them. What follows is one of the bloodiest gang wars ever committed to celluloid filled with shoot-outs, people run over with cars, broken necks, heads split open, throat slittings, stabbings, fingers bitten off, decapitations, kung fu, and more. One of the most extreme and disturbing underground movies ever made, DEADBEAT AT DAWN is a powerful and incredibly brutal experience that will leave you feeling like you were hit below the belt multiple times for days afterward. Beautifully shot on 16mm with some excellent stunt work and very realistic effects (handled by VanBebber himself), DEADBEAT has often been compared with Buddy Giovinazzo's COMBAT SHOCK (1986), and has a very grindhouse vibe to it similar with other movies like BASKET CASE (1982) and STREET TRASH (1987). All I can say is you haven't lived until you've seen DEADBEAT or VanBebber's other classic THE MANSON FAMILY (2003) for that matter. If you want to see brutality done right, you can't go wrong with VanBebber. The now out-of-print Synapse Films DVD contains an audio commentary with VanBebber and producer Mike King, outtakes, VanBebber's vicious and disturbing short film MY SWEET SATAN (1993) (originally released on VHS by Film Threat Video) with optional commentary by VanBebber and the cast and crew, a promotional short for a never produced slasher film called CHUNK BLOWER VanBebber had planned to make (also with optional commentary by Jim), and a director filmography. Now available on DVD from Dark Sky Films as a 2-Disc Special Edition with new extras either separately or as a part of the \"Visions of Hell: The Films of Jim VanBebber\" box set which also contains THE MANSON FAMILY.

They were clowns that died years ago in a train accident in which the train crashed to the bottom of the sea near the coast while they were doing a circus tour. As the result of a massive storm that hits the coast, the waterlogged corpses of the clowns come back as zombie killers that kind of look like Fulci zombies and they use a variety of weapons to do away with their victims in various gruesome manners. Steve Sessions (whose other efforts include CREMAINS (2001), HELLBOUND: BOOK OF THE DEAD (2003), MALEFIC (2003), SOUTHERN GOTHIC (2005), TORMENT (2008), and AT THE HOUSE OF MADNESS (2008) manages to make DEAD CLOWNS a gory, suspenseful thrill ride with an excellent B-movie cast including Jeff Dylan Graham, Debbie Rochon, Eric Spudic, Brinke Stevens, Lucien Eisenach, Kimberly Lynn Cole, and Robyn Griggs. The characters are all very interesting (especially Spudic as a wheelchair-bound man fighting off the zombie clowns) and the make-up effects aren't half-bad either. Overall, DEAD CLOWNS is a decent micro budget effort worth popping in the DVD player on a rainy evening. The Lions Gate DVD doesn't contain any significant extras except for a trailer and trailers for other releases. A Lions Gate Films DVD Release. Rated R - MD\n\nDEAD GIRLS (1990) - This slasher tells the story of the \"Dead Girls\" rock band. The lyrics in their songs say that life i s a \"bummer\" and it's not worth living. A group of teenagers listen to the lyrics and commit group suicide by slitting their wrists. The lead singer's young sister who led the kids in the group suicide survives and ends up paralyzed. She goes on a retreat with her sister and her band to a cabin in the mountains. Soon a masked psycho begins picking everyone off one by one. The killer uses weapons according to lyrics in the songs. Overall, this movie isn't the greatest, but you could do far worse. There is some decent gore and deaths and there are so many damn twists near the end, it almost gives you a headache. The people who made this one gave us other low budgeters like FATAL IMAGES (1988), HELL SPA (1992), THINGS (1993), THINGS 2 (1998), and HAUNTED (1998).

It's so bad, it could probably cure cancer! - Editor\n\nDEADLANDS: THE RISING (2006)  Low budget apocalyptic zombie movie starts off with America being besieged by a string of biological weapon attacks. People are directed by federal and local authorities to head off to secure areas being maintained by the military in the evacuation procedures. But it turns out that the weapons used in the attacks were harboring some unknown element that brings the dead back to life. And they appear to be hungry for human flesh. A small Midwestern town is overrun by zombies and gory mayhem ensues. The heroes of the story Gary and Brian along with Brians wife Michelle and their son fight for their lives. In going up against the flesh-craving ghouls, they hope to escape to a safe place somewhere and find out if there are any other survivors like them. DEADLANDS: THE RISING is a pretty decent first effort from Gary Ugarek who directs, writes, produces, edits, composes and stars as Gary. The film has its moments of gore (ripped out organs, brain eating, flesh and gut munching, spinal cord ripped out, etc.) and the filmmakers made good use of everything they had knowing they didnt have much money. It will be interesting to see what Ugarek can do if given a bigger budget. The Tempe/Splatter Rampage DVD contains a directors commentary, cast commentary, an interview with Ugarek, an interview with producer Brian Wright (who stars as Brian), the original teaser trailer, a 10-minute short film called I AM ZOMBIE MAN with an introduction by director Nick Thompson, and trailers for other Splatter Rampage releases. With Dave Cooperman, Michelle Wright, and Connor Brandt. A Tempe DVD Release.

It tells the story of the town of Eidolon Crossing, a town that was once prosperous and the home to Dogwood Park, a successful amusement park that children would go to all the time. But all this changed once kids started disappearing and turning up brutally murdered. Bo dies were found in an old mine shaft. This led to the park's closure and the eventual collapse of Eidolon Crossing's economy and it's reputation as a peaceful place. Jake Richardson's (William Clifton) brother disappeared in the town back in 1979. Being obsessed with finding out who was behind his brother's disappearance and finally getting to the bottom of whoever or whatever was responsible for all the other bizarre occurrences and deaths from over the years, Jake goes back to the town to investigate in hopes of getting the truth once and for all. But getting the truth turns out to be an uphill battle and a nightmare as well. Jake is haunted by the spirits of the dead children and hears voices and sees other apparitions. Jake is driven to desperation to find out what it all means and what he finds in the end turns out to be something much bigger than he bargained for. DEADWOOD PARK is a beautiful, eerie, suspenseful, and atmospheric film. It is without a doubt Wicked Pixel's greatest accomplishment thus far. The movie doesn't rely on blood and guts to be scary (although it does get kind of gory near the end), the choice of location and scenery is excellent, and William Clifton gives a fine performance in the lead role. It goes to show how far Eric Stanze and Wicked Pixel have come over the years. This is absolutely their most professional-looking film to date. The Cinema Epoch DVD of DEADWOOD contains an audio commentary with Stanze, outtakes, and a music video of \"Zombie '79\" by Crypt 33. With Lindsey Luscri, Bryan Lane, Jason Allen Wolfe, Ramona Midgett, Dick Mintzlaff, Joseph R. Engel, Daniel Byrington, Benjamin Gaa, Matthew S.

Brad and his friends listen to it not knowing that it contains a track that turns its listeners into zombies. They become flesh hungry ghouls and the evil spirit of the band's lead singer tells them to go out and kill. The town gets overrun by zombies and Brad's girlfriend and another one of his friends must find a way to play the tape backwards to stop them and destroy Living Corpse's reign of terror. This shot on video horror comedy (also known as DEAD ROCK ZOMBIES) is definitely one of the cheapest-looking micro budget crap fests I've ever seen. It falls into the \"so bad it's funny\" category for sure. This one is about on the same level as the stuff from W.A.V.E. Productions. The acting is so bad you'd swear these people went to some kind of school to learn how to act that way. We get lots of cheap gore effects, incredibly dumb characters, a Richard Nixon-masked killer inspired by HORROR HOUSE ON HIGHWAY 5 (1985) who has nothing to do with the plot, a Kurt Cobain look-alike, a rapper who sits on a knife, references to other big metal bands (including Metallica), and laugh out loud dialogue. The end credits say the film is dedicated to Kurt Cobain since it was made shortly after his death. The music in this one is by Relapse Records. Some of the bands on the soundtrack are Pungent Stench, Dead World, Dismember, Brutality, Exit 13, etc. DEATH METAL ZOMBIES is a prime example of what you get when you give gore movie and metal fans a couple hundred bucks, lots of fake blood, a blank cassette and a camcorder (a very cheap one too, since the movie is so dark most of the time). Director Todd Jason Cook did other shot on video horrors like EVIL NIGHT (1992), DEMON DOLLS (1993), THE DUMMY (a.k.a. BLOODY ANNIVERSARY - 1994), and FRIGHTMARES (1997). His Texas-based company named Cemetery Cinema (a poor man's Sinister Cinema) went out of business in 1998. Cook has not directed anything else since. Not really surprising when you think about it. The company distributed early movies by Chris Seaver and Low Budget Pictures. With Lisa Cook, Bill DeWild, Todd Cook, C. Jo Vela, Mike Gebbie, Thomas Banta, Terry Aden, Wes Dodson, Jan Mundorf, Sabrina Cook, Milly Leonard, and Jerry McGhee. A Cemetery Cinema Release.

After that fails, the two give up, and later the doll suddenly comes to life all by itself. As it turns out, the doll is possessed by the devil (surprise, surprise) and it has the power to imitate anyone it sees or comes into contact with. It orders Scott to kill his friends and after Scott refuses to comply, it imitates Scott and starts killing them all. The doll soon possesses Scott and Stacey and has them go against each other in a supernatural battle of \"evil vs. evil.\" Are you able to follow any of this? If not, that doesn't surprise me. Ultra-cheesy BLACK DEVIL DOLL FROM HELL (1984) rip-off is not really something worth going out of your way for, but if you're somebody like me who must have everything at all costs, go ahead and see for yourself if it's worth the effort. After all, it's my job to review these things because I have to. Cook writes and directs and stars as Scott. With Lisa Cook, Rik Deskin, Joey Scarborough, Penny Spellman, and Scott Spellman.

A junkie named Jesse (Dennis Stewart) runs into some trouble with a couple fellow drug dealers. Lucinda saves him from getting his ass kicked by chowing down on the one's throat and scaring the other away. Jesse takes her back to his place because she has nowhere else to go. His girlfriend doesn't take too kindly to this. He soon learns that Lucinda is a demon queen who feeds on flesh to survive. Some of her victims come back as zombies. This is the first of camcorder guru Donald Farmer's shot on video gore fests. He of course brought us other \"classics\" like CANNIBAL HOOKERS (1987), SCREAM DREAM (1989), and AN EROTIC VAMPIRE IN PARIS (2002). You pretty much know what to expect with this one: lots of blood, boobs, and low production values. It has bad acting and weak photography, but the gore is very graphic and includes throat rippings, throat munching, a face ripped off, frothy zombie drool, and a nauseating heart ripping with lots of spurting blood. The make-up effects (handled by an unsung Rick Gonzales who also worked with Tom Savini on DAY OF THE DEAD [1985]) are surprisingly half decent. If you love watching really amateurish video features, this could be your cup of tea. All others should stay clear. With Cliff Dance, Patti Valliere, David Blood, and Rick Foster.

Barbara Ann (Frances Raines) is upset with her twin sister Alicia for sleeping with her boyfriend. Meanwhile Barbara Ann is getting weird phone calls with awful loud noises and vibrations coming from the receiver. She soon meets up with Franklin (Mark Walker) and begins a relationship with him. Franklin is a kind but strange young man. Soon it turns out that he is a psychopath who picks up women, takes them back to his place, and brutally stabs them to death after sex. After Franklin is gunned down by the police, they think the nightmare is over but it isn't. More women turn up dead and Barbara Ann keeps getting the strange phone calls slowly driving her to madness. It all has something to with a creepy old man she met at the beginning who asked to use her phone. This film is the directing debut of Gorman Bechard who gave us PSYCHOS IN LOVE (1986) and CEMETERY HIGH (1988). While those films are clearly horror comedies, DISCONNECTED is a more serious film. I found it to be very disturbing. The scene where Raines has a dream about hanging up a blood splattered painting and the scene at the end where she destroys the telephone and hears strange voices and noises in her apartment is very unsettling. The film isn't horribly gory, though it does have a few bloody scenes. It's scary for the most part in a Hitchcock kind of way. There are some Hitchcock references in it as well. It's kind of hard to find but worth checking out if you get the chance. With Carl Koch and Carmine Capobianco. An Active Home Video Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nDUCK! THE CARBINE HIGH MASSACRE (1999) - One of the most controversial indie flicks of all time, William Hellfire and Joey Smack's take on teen angst and school violence is a violent, gory, and over-the-top excursion into dangerous waters that landed the two of them in jail at the time. Let free once it was determined no crime was committed, their movie has gained a cult following as a feature with a political message about how the media has a tendency to exploit violence and death in today's society rather than the movie just being an exploitation of the Columbine tragedy itself which some had accused it of being. Hellfire and Smack both star in the roles of two outcast high school kids whose characters are based on Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold. The characters put up with teasing and bullying at school and one day decide they have no faith that anyone can help them with their problems and the two go on a shooting rampage at their high school before taking their own lives. The story is actually not too farfetched in describing the kind of atmosphere the Columbine kids were most likely exposed to. The environment the kids are in is filled with sex, drugs, rock music, religious fanatics, jocks, and peer pressure. Hellfire and Smack did a fine job of portraying the reality of these situations that occur everyday in schools across the country. While the movie has a tendency to be a little over-the-top at times, for the most part the social commentary on how people are so quick to judge something as being exploitive while at the same time exploiting awful events themselves on an almost daily basis is very evident throughout and the overall message is very effective. Hellfire and Smack co-directed and co-produced as well as co-wrote with Pete Jacelone. The cast features Misty Mundae, Lilly Tiger, Kendall 'Shorty' Ward, Liz Bathory, Mike Raso, Zachary Winston Snygg, and Bob Gonzo. The Shriek Show DVD of DUCK contains deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes Court TV footage, \"Today is the Day\" concert footage, interview with Hellfire, photo gallery, and trailers.

When this group sees what power the machine holds, they use it to help them resurrect dead historical figures to obtain their treasures that were buried with them. Once another crime syndicate becomes privy to what's going on, a battle ensues over the machine and soon everyone will learn that obtaining such power will come with a price that's more than they bargained for. While ZOMBIE PLANET (2004) and REDWOOD JUSTIN (2006) are moderately entertaining horror-action films that combine fantasy and adventure with the zombie and vampire subgenres, THE EDISON DEATH MACHINE takes on a totally different concept and the result is a more creative and better-crafted film. While the effects and stunt work are just as good as the other films and the movie contains the same Full Moon-style atmosphere common with other Bonilla and ZP films, the more interesting story and concept is what elevates this one above the others. The result is an entertaining B-grade horror flick and despite the limited resources and low budget ZP was working with, the intriguing story and characters help things along the way. With Stacey T. Gillespie, Ashley Arkels, Billy W. Blackwell, Cherokee Hall, and Frank Santoroski. The ZP International DVD of THE EDISON DEATH MACHINE contains a commentary with Bonilla, bloopers, trailers, and animated menus. A ZP International DVD Release.

Legend has it that people who masturbate in the Cochwoods forest threaten to conjure up the monster who will go on a crazed killing spree. We start the story out with Geno and his low life, foul-mouthed fat slob friend named Sam who lives with his father. Sam drives around cursing and spewing all sorts of obscenities like there's no tomorrow (\"Ah, you cocksucker! You motherfucker!\", \"You stupid, motherfucking, cunt sucking faggot!\", and \"You monkey tit! Monkey tit! Monkey tit!\"), runs over an old man standing in the middle of the road and pees on him. It so turns out that somebody went and cranked one off out in Cochwoods and the evil Cochwoods Monster (basically a man in standard black slasher clothing with a monster mask) springs up and goes on gory rampage turning the countryside upside down. It's up to Geno and the local cops to find a way to trap the monster and kill it. Despite being zero budget and shot with a camcorder with incredibly cheesy acting, stunts and effects, EVIL AWAKENING manages to be a very fun time with lots of humor. Director Geno McGahee definitely has his heart in the right place as the campy feeling the movie starts off with keeps up for the duration and there's plenty of gore and funny one-liners to keep you entertained. This alone makes it easy to forgive some of the shortcomings with the technical factors. It will be interesting to see what Geno and X Posse can do when they have more money. The DVD contains a commentary with the crew, the original 1996 EVIL AWAKENING short film, a music video, trailer, and a promo teaser for Geno and X Posse's new movie RISE OF THE SCARECROWS (2008).

Hes constantly being picked on by the other students and hes looking for a break. After a girl who he likes decides to play a cruel joke on him with the help of some other frat boys, Jimmy decides enough is enough. Being a science genius, he creates a potion that gives powers to levitate objects with his mind, he dons a clown outfit and pursues to bump off all his tormentors at a students house party in various gory and innovative ways. We get fingers through eyes, car sun roof decapitations, dismemberments, beer bottles down the throat, heads blown off with exploding cigarettes, lawn sprinkler impalements, spiked frat paddles in the back, heads crushed with boots, and a finale where the lead female screamer uses Jimmys potion to bring all the dead bodies back to life as zombies. The first shot on video effort from Todd Jason Cook and Cemetery Cinema of Texas is a not a bad little timewaster if you need to kill 90 minutes. Cook would of course go on to do the supernatural doll flick DEMON DOLLS (1993), the anthology movie HORRORSCOPE (1994), the zombie comedy classic DEATH METAL ZOMBIES (1995), and the killer ventriloquist dummy flick THE DUMMY (1994).

After murdering the parents of young girl by the name of Alice Walker, he disappears for 20 years. Now Alice is grown up (played by Rosemary Gore) and keeps seeing the maniac in her nightmares. Her friend tells her shes driving herself crazy and she needs to let go of the past. Soon enough, Alice sees the murder of a family in one of her dreams, and the next morning its reported that a family was brutally hacked to death. A string of more gory killings ensue that Alice can see in her sleep. She believes shes psychically linked to the killer. She decides to go out and find him herself and stop him even if she dies trying. Though the films twist ending can be seen coming from a mile away, its a very enjoyable video gore effort from Glen Baisley. The killings are very nasty and splattery (including a very nauseating disemboweling scene). The effects by Anthony Eikner and Brian Spears arent too bad. Rosemary Gore does a good job in the lead role. Baisleys other horror efforts include THE TENEMENT (2003) and SINS OF THE FATHER (2004). You can visit the production company on the web at http://www.lightanddark.net/.

The \"safe place\" turns out to be the Bathory House. A few friends decide to get together and go up to the Bathory House for a night of fun and sex with some hookers. Only problem is this motley crew doesn't quite know what they're getting themselves into. It so turns out that the girls of the Bathory House are vampires with a thirst for human blood. The night of fun and sex ends in a bloodbath. One guy decides to go search the brothel for his girlfriend who ran off to become a prostitute. He then ends up blowing the lid off the pressure cooker by breaking an old treaty between the vampire whores and a group of Irish mercenaries. The lead mercenary Sheridan (Mike Watt) gets together with his buddies to fight the bloodsuckers and rescue the one dude's missing girlfriend. It's an all-out monster killing fest in the vein of THE RESURRECTION GAME (2001), but with vampires instead of zombies. You get your blood, gore, sex and action. Fun for the whole family! Watt wrote and directed and Amy Lynn Best produced and plays the part of Elizabeth, the lead vampire.

Not being able to remember what exactly happened, he decides to put it behind him. Then all of a sudden Danny starts to change and his friends and family take notice. He loses his job and then things really begin to take a nosedive. A string of murders begins to plague the town with bodies turning up mutilated. Danny notices himself beginning to transform. It turns out that whatever it was that he ran into that one night has caused him to turn into a manbeast with a taste for human blood.

When it comes to the bad, the offensive, the funny, the gory, the outrageous, the over-the- top and the risqué in the world of low budget filmmaking, nobody beats them. The Tempe/Splatter Rampage Double Feature DVD of FILTHY MCNASTIER and FILTHY MCNASTIEST proves just that. The two sequels to the LBP classic FILTHY MCNASTY provide the perfect entertainment for male and female viewers. In MCNASTIER, a young girl is tired of having small boobs and wants giant knockers so the guys will like her. Phil the Demon is back to grant her this wish. But as always, you have to be careful what you wish for. We are introduced to a vampire by the name of Razor McBleed whos a Journey fan and things soon start to go downhill. In MCNASTIEST, a young man is tired of his small penis and wants a humongous shlong so he can declare himself a real sex machine. His huge-breasted bitch girlfriend (played by adult film star Cherry Brady) breaks up with him because of this. He enlists the help of his witch friend so she can summon the Sex Demon to give him what he wants. This fails at first and later the Sex Demon appears (I believe its the sister of Phil the Demon). The female demon makes the witch girl magically grow a dick so they can fuck. Then the demon magically grows a dick and kills the witch girl by pulling her guts out through her asshole while shes screwing her up the ass. Our lonely guy with the small dick wakes up to the find that the demon has granted his wish and he has an enormous 4-foot shlong. But as expected, this miracle soon turns out to be a curse. The parties in both movies end in gore-soaked bloodbaths with vampires and zombies. The films are loaded with sick and offensive material in the vein of Troma, naked girls, dicks getting chopped off, dismemberment, toilet humor, and more outrageous stuff that I cant remember at the moment. MCNASTIEST contains appearances by Andy Copp, Henrique Couto, John Karyus, and Tromas Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. Watch this double feature on a night when youre in the mood for a good up-all-night vomit-semen-blood-feces-spunk-dookie fest.

Unfortunately for the teens going along with this, what they dont know is theyre being tricked into acting in a snuff film. After a couple kids are killed off, the surviving teen girl (Tina Ona Paukstelis from THE UNEARTHING - 1994) and boy (Matthew Winkler) run off into the woods and fight for their lives. They find their way to a guys house and ask to use his phone. But the killers end up finding their way the house and the man and his wife both meet gruesome demises. The two then find another house and ask the homeowner (Karen Dilloo) to call for help. Unfortunately it turns out that she is a part of the murderous gangs snuff filmmaking conspiracy. The two find themselves cornered with the leading psycho, and his thugs are preparing them for the final cut of their film. More attempts to escape are made and from then on out the two teens fight to defeat the psychopaths. For an early SOV effort from the director who would go on to bring us the more professional OCTOBER MOON (2005), 5 DARK SOULS isnt that bad. Granted, its nothing that youd want to brag about, but if youd like to take a look at a filmmakers work as it progresses with time, effort and money, its a pretty decent example to follow. Financed by Michael D. Moore and MDM Productions. The film contains a scene where the kids rent the Moore Video release of DERANGED (1974). R.M. Hoopes, Alucarda and Dika Newlin did the soundtrack. Brinke Stevens is thanked in the end credits. The tape contains trailers for other Moore releases, information on the releases of Collums MARK OF THE DEVIL 666: THE MORALIST (1995) and Tim Ritters CREEP (1995), an interview with Collum and a few of the cast members, behind-the-scenes footage and bloopers. Collum did 5 DARK SOULS PART 2: ROOTS OF EVIL (1998) next. Collums 5 DARK SOULS PART 3: RETRIBUTION (2003) has yet to see release. Tempe is supposed to release a 5 DARK SOULS trilogy 3-disc special edition DVD sometime in late 2007-early 2008.

She proceeds to interview several friends and family members of all the victims and killers. But everybody who she interviews soon turns up dead. It is learned that one of the maniacs named Piper got away and another one named Nancy ended up in a mental institution. Somebody who closely resembles Eddie, another one of the psychos who got killed four years ago, is seen wandering around a college campus. Its suspected that this person may be a twin brother of Eddie. As the bodies pile up, Olivia begins to feel wave of terror closing in on her. While this sequel is every bit as interesting and enjoyable as the first film, its main problem is that its way too long (two and a half hours). It seems like it couldve used more trimming to tighten the pace and theres some boring bits that we couldve done without. Its not horrible, but had it been 50 minutes shorter, it wouldve cut back on viewers dozing off. With Tina Ona Paukstelis, Matthew Winkler, Karen Dilloo, Christopher D.

The police investigate while Bill is searching for answers as to what happened on his own and trying to provide comfort to Richard's wife Gloria (Liz Haverty). Things become more and more bizarre as the mystery unravels. Bloody deaths, sex, and sleaze are all thrown into the mix. 5 DEAD ON THE CRIMSON CANVAS is a pretty decent tribute to the giallos of Argento and Bava with some nice Hitchcock touches along the way. Shot on Super 8 for very little money by director Joseph F. Parda, the settings in the film have a rather gothic quality and there are some okay gore effects as well as some T&A and sex for good measure. The twist ending takes a really neat turn and the overall tribute to classic giallos pays off quite nicely. The Cinema Image DVD contains an audio commentary with director Parda and Joe Zaso, audition footage, a stills gallery, slide show, and trailers for other Cinema Image releases. The DVD also contains an insert with a review of the film by Paul J. Brown that was published in an issue of Is It Uncut? Magazine. A Cinema Image Productions DVD Release.

Now in the present, a group of parapsychologists make a trip out to a mansion believed to be haunted to investigate and are confronted by three demons in the form of beautiful women. It appears that Fischer conjured up the demons with the amulet before his death. The group of investigators find themselves trapped in a hellhole as the demons pick them in off in extremely gory ways and zombies of past victims return to wreak havoc. Embarrassed as I am to say this, I must admit I actually liked this one. I don't think it's nearly as bad as what some have said. Granted, it's not without its flaws, but I've seen much worse. Terry M. West wrote and directed this one for Carl Morano and Fever Dreams Productions. It's not the best thing West has done, but it's very professional looking for the most part, there's a good bit of nudity to be found, and the gore and make-up effects by Brian Spears and Pete Gerner are actually pretty good. Legendary British scream queen Caroline Munro is featured in a cameo and the cast also features fine B-movie gals like Ruby LaRocca, Barbara Joyce, and Jane Scarlett.

Hand brings us this bizarre and intriguing take on the Frankenstein story, shot on Super 8 and written, directed, produced, edited by and starring Hand. Hand is Dr. Victor Karlstein who runs a medical facility. After his girlfriend dies due to a condition at the clinic, Karlstein manages to reanimate her, but she needs the fresh body parts of women in order to survive. Acts of murder and butchery ensue as Karlstein searches for body parts needed to give the love of his life a new body. FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY NIGHTMARE is a decent, ambitious effort with a very artsy feel to it. While definitely not the best I've seen, there is much worse. Some viewers may find it confusing and may need multiple viewings to understand it better. Those with an open mind who are able to follow it closely will be able to appreciate Hand's effort and his handling of the picture on such a shoestring budget. That along makes the DVD worth a purchase. You also have to love the name of one of the characters, \"Andrew Milligan.\" Nice homage I must add. The Unearthed Films DVD contains a director's commentary, a making-of featurette, photo gallery, and trailers for other releases. An Unearthed Films DVD Release. Unrated - MD\n\nGEEK MAGGOT BINGO (1983) - Nick Zedd films are an acquired taste. Of the films of his that I've seen so far, I'd say GEEK MAGGOT BINGO (a.k.a. THE FREAK FROM SUCKWEASEL MOUNTAIN) is my favorite. This low budget 16mm horror spoof became popular at midnight showings and has gained some cult status. It spoofs old Universal monsters like Dracula and Frankenstein, uses props and sets that look like they came from high school plays, and it delivers in cheesy gore, sex, and offensive humor. Donna Death stars as the vampire Scumbalina, Robert Andrews is Dr. Frankenberry, Brenda Bergman is Buffy, Richard Hell from the punk band The Voidoids is the Rawhide Kid, Bruno Zeus is the hunchback Geeko, Gumby Spangler is Flavian, and Jim Giacama is Dean Quagmire. The Formaldehyde Man created by Frankenberry is a two-headed monster that wreaks havoc near the end. Some of the makeup and gore effects by Tyler Smith, Ed French and Tom Lauten are half decent. Horror host John Zacherley does an introduction to the movie and he tells us to strap Dixie cups to our noses. Fangoria's Bob Martin has a cameo as \"Uncle Bob\" himself trying to sell magazines to the Formaldehyde monster. He gets his head ripped off and the head keeps talking. I thought that was one of the funniest scenes in the movie. The DVD from Eclectic DVD Distribution contains an interview with the cast and the Zedd short films ELF PANTIES, LORD OF THE COCK RINGS, and THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA. Be sure to check out Zedd's first feature THEY EAT SCUM (1979), a Super-8 punk rock splatter comedy that probably laid the groundwork for Peter Jackson's BAD TASTE (1987) and MEET THE FEEBLES (1989). A Penetration Video Release. Not Rated - MD\n\nGHOUL SCHOOL (1990) - A high school's water supply gets poisoned by an unusual chemical. The chemical causes students and members of the school's swim team to turn into flesh eating zombies that wreak havoc in the school. It's up to two horror fan nerds and a rock band to stop the hungry ghouls. In all honesty, I thought this was a funny, tongue-in-cheek Troma-inspired horror comedy. There's lots of good lines in this one like \"I think they're putting too much chlorine in the pool,\" and \"We're trying to save you, not fuck you.\" I thought it was hilarious how every time somebody asks what's going on, the kids say, \"It's the swim team!\" There's also a scene where the kids watch ROBOT NINJA (1989) on TV. The film has plenty of graphic gore including dismemberments, guts pulled out, a beheading, throat ripping, a head ripped open, zombies spewing green stuff, etc. We get appearances by Joe Franklin and Jackie \"The Joke Man\" Martling as themselves. The one scene with Martling telling a bunch of corny jokes to Franklin is a total laugh riot. If you likeI WAS A TEENAGE ZOMBIE (1987) you'll probably enjoy this one. Written-produced-directed by Timothy O'Rawe. With William Friedman, Scott Gordon, Paul Venier, Nancy Sirianni, Ed Burrows, and John Paul Fedele. A Tempe Video Release. Also available on a special \"Splatter University Edition\" DVD from Camp Motion Pictures. Unrated - MD NOTE: I knew director Tim O'Rawe when he worked at a local Blockbuster Video in Totowa, NJ (this was about the mid-80's). He kept telling me that he was going to direct a horror film in the near future. It's all he would ever talk about. It looks like he did it. This movie was lensed in Wayne, NJ using local landmarks like the high school and various businesses. This film has been floating around for years (and usually gets awful write-ups) and has now been released on DVD!!! Unfortunately, O'Rawe has never directed anything else except the unfinished THE BASEMENT (1989), which Camp Motion Pictures picked-up, re-edited and dubbed-in dialogue (since the Super 8 production was filmed without sound) and released it as part of a kick-ass VHS/DVD box set. - Editor\n\nTHE GOD MEMOIRS (2007) - Bringing a new kind of twist to the traditional serial killer story, Brian Hirschbine and Abortion Bin Productions bring us the story of a character known as \"The Man\" (played by Brandon Hursell). The man has tried to find answers to life's many questions for years. Trying to understand God and why some things in the world occur the way they do, he does monologues where he talks about God and people's beliefs. In a flashback, where are shown the man as a child and how he was stabbed, almost to death, by his father right after his father gorily beat his mother to death with a frying pan. His father then blew his brains out. In order to find these answers to life's many questions, he resorts to killing as a way to find the human co"
