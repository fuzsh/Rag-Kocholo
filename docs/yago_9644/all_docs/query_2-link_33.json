        "text": "“Sup dawgs! I’m Xzibit, from Pimp my Film! We heard that you liked making movies about geeky high school guys who seem likeable but struggle with bullies and talking to girls they have crushes on. We’re gonna hook you up with another movie that’s basically a watered-down PG-13 version of Superbad so we can hit the middle school crowd. [Silence.] OK, OK, we’ll throw in Steven Brill, the director of Heavy Weights and Little Nicky. [Longer silence.] And Owen Wilson.” The rest is history.\n\nAll jokes aside, Drillbit Taylor reuses the Superbad formula with uninteresting results. Wade (Nate Hartley), an awkward, lanky kid with a meathead stepfather, and his big-boned friend Ryan (Troy Gentile) enter highschool with a bang. That is, the bang of a locker door slamming on a nerd named Emmit (David Dorfman). The three begin a search for a bodyguard who will protect them from two bullies, which turns up Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson), a homeless man seeking a quick score in order to expatriate himself to the Northwest Territories.\n\nWade, Ryan, and Emmit clearly resemble Superbad’s Evan, Seth, and Fogel, a.k.a. McLovin. Ryan and Seth both wear t-shirts with pop comedy references: one of Ryan’s shirts pays homage to South Park, while one of Seth’s elegizes Richard Pryor. Ryan’s exasperation with Wade’s sympathy for Emmit’s extreme uncoolness reminds filmgoers of Seth’s anger toward Evan for planning to room with Fogel in college."
