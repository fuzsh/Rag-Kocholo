        "text": "All good winning streaks must come to an end, eventually.\n\nThere can be no denying it -- the Judd Apatow comedy dream machine has had a great run, from \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\" to \"Knocked Up\" to \"Superbad.\"\n\nNow here comes \"Drillbit Taylor,\" just to keep Apatow and company honest.\n\nThe movie, for and about teens -- the nerdy, repressed, but secretly cool teens that these films routinely champion -- is a misfire in the most fundamental sense.\n\nBased on a story idea that had been floating around Hollywood for 20 years -- yes, 20 years, although 20 minutes seems more like it -- the movie introduces us to three high school freshmen who decide to fight back against the local bully by hiring an adult bodyguard.\n\nThe kids don't have a lot of spare cash, naturally, so they get what they pay for -- Drillbit Taylor, portrayed here by Owen Wilson.\n\nWilson, back on screen after facing his own real-life abyss last year, isn't the problem here. A slacker dude like Drillbit is tailor-made for the star, and he looks and feel as comfortable as ever in the role.\n\nThe script, however, written by Seth Rogen (star of \"Knocked Up\" and writer of \"Superbad\"), misconceives Drillbit from the get-go.\n\nThe guy is homeless, which makes him desperate. He sees the kids as, collectively, an easy mark, but the kids have done nothing to deserve this. We care, obviously, for these 98-pound weaklings (well, one's a 180-pound weakling), so when Drillbit and his homeless cohorts begin stealing from their parents' homes we cringe uncomfortably.\n\nThe tonal mistakes don't stop there.\n\nWe've all known bullies. Even if we were fortunate enough to escape their attention in school, we watched helplessly as others were roundly humiliated.\n\nThe chief bully of \"Drillbit Taylor,\" however, isn't just mean, he's a psychopath. He (Alex Frost) doesn't just pull down pants, he breaks noses, destroys laptops and threatens to kill people. That's so not cool, especially in what purports to be a light-hearted comedy.\n\nBeyond these miscalculations, the movie just isn't funny enough. The three newcomers who play the teens -- Nate Hartley, Troy Gentile and David Dorfman -- are all winning, although Dorfman's character appears excessively crazed.\n\nWilson is always a comforting presence, even if his character is larcenous. The scenes where he, impersonating a substitute teacher, seduces an instructor played by Leslie Mann (otherwise known as Mrs. Apatow) are fun, even if they are as chauvinistic as anything that's come before from the Apatow school.\n\nBut for every moment where we get to watch Drillbit teach the teens the finer points of Mexican judo (as in \"judon't know who you messin' with, homz\"), we then have to watch him steal from them behind their backs.\n\nWe'll say this -- \"Drillbit Taylor\" is considerably less raunchy than \"Superbad\" and \"Knocked Up,\" probably because the lead characters are 14-year-olds. We've enjoyed much of the Apatow raunch, but were kind of relieved not to have to go there again.\n\nHad this movie been a little indie straggler grasping for affection, without any big names in front of or behind the camera, this review might have been more generous with its star rating. But \"Drillbit Taylor\" has the feel of a throwaway by a gaggle of drunk-on-their-success filmmakers going back to their money trough once too often.\n\nWe ain't buying.\n\nRating note: This one-and-a-half-star film is rated PG-13 for crude sexual references throughout, strong bullying, language, drug references and partial nudity. 109 min."
