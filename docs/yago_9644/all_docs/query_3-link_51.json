        "text": "XLrator Media has just released a new trailer and one-sheet for the upcoming horror-comedy Inbred and it looks like one hell of a good time. When the name of the film is Inbred you know it’s going to be pretty messed up and from the looks of this trailer it certainly seems like its headed in that direction, which is all sorts of awesome. The characters run around in some awesome looking masks and are so unbelievably white trash that I couldn’t help but smile.\n\nWhen four troubled teens and their social workers take a community service trip to a remote Yorkshire village, a minor incident with some local inbred youths rapidly escalates into a violent, deliriously warped nightmare.\n\nDirected by Alex Chandon, Inbred stars Jo Hartley, James Doherty, Seamus O’Neill and James Burrows and was written by Chandon and Paul Shrimpton. The film will hit VOD on August 22nd before landing on DVD on September 24th!"
