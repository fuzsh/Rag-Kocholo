        "text": "In this edition of The Out Door, we explore why Kim Gordon has proven to be the most adventurous member of Sonic Youth since the band's demise, trace multi-instrumentalist Ashley Paul's journey from studying music to busking in the subway, create new instruments with cellist Hildur Gudnadóttir, and explore the pros and cons of technique with three young guitarists: Matthew Mullane, Cam Deas, and Norberto Lobo. (Follow us on Twitter and Tumblr for more experimental music news and info.)\n\nI: Sonic Rebirth\n\nBody/Head: Kim Gordon and Bill Nace\n\nI could have slept until the morning. Not long after the sun went down on a recent late fall Saturday, I fell asleep on the couch, tired from too much work during the week and too much fun during the weekend. But eventually, I rolled over and saw the time. I knew that if I was going to see Body/Head, who had already played one of the best sets I’d seen all year, I’d better stir sooner rather than later. It was a benefit, after all, for women’s healthcare in politically beleaguered North Carolina, and I’d bought two pricey tickets that afternoon.\n\nPerhaps I should have simply considered the money a donation, though. This set from the typically excellent duo of Kim Gordon and Bill Nace felt perfunctory, as though they too had struggled to rise from an early-evening rest. On the stage of Kings, a mid-sized club in the state’s capital, the pair struggled to lock into a single, unified approach during two short improvisations. At one point, Nace thrashed about at center stage, slinging his guitar against the volume pumping from his amplifier; the action made me think of someone trying to kickstart a particularly cantankerous motorcycle.\n\nAnd near set’s end, Gordon left the microphone to push her guitar against a wall at the stage’s rear, slowly pushing it toward the ceiling. It seemed in part like an offering or maybe a way to give the thinning crowd something to see more than a very good band trying and failing to find an inroad into this one-off show. They were both good-faith gestures, I suppose, but neither Nace nor Gordon could make the moment anything more than an instance where the risk of improvised music surpassed the reward.\n\nI was disappointed, of course, as that couch certainly felt comfortable. In some way, though, watching Body/Head struggle to cohere or compel was a reassuring feeling, evidence of a group that is working out new definitions of how it sounds, functions, and defines itself every time it plugs in its instruments, whether onstage or in a studio. Only eight months earlier, in a grand auditorium in Knoxville, Tennessee, Nace and Gordon dazzled. Their collective volume locked into daring sculptures and then splintered into a dozen irregular shards. Standing in front of ponderous video projections, the pair moved as if they were trapped inside an amoeboid world of their own, communicating in a language that only they understood but that the listener could at least enjoy. With her voice, Gordon seemed to channel the stories of forever-anxious ghosts.\n\nSo, in the last eight months, had Body/Head just gotten bad, somehow slipping out of practice or energy? No, they just tried something that didn’t work. That’s the gamble of experimental music—or at least it should be.\n\nAs surprising as it may seem given the avant bona fides of her former bandmates, Gordon has emerged as the true cutting-edge alumna of Sonic Youth, following her split with longtime husband and collaborator Thurston Moore in 2011. Sure, Moore has continued to piss collaborations with other stars of the avant world, but his two big records—the ones with proper label campaigns, full tours and so on—have been fine-but-functional indie rock bores. Chelsea Light Moving was a mess of ideas united by stand-and-deliver songs, while the most powerful moments of his recent The Best Day sounds like Sonic Youth’s Murray Street, minus the ecstasy of urgency. Steve Shelley has become something of a singer-songwriter timekeeper for hire, and Lee Ranaldo’s pair of records with his band the Dust make you wonder where all that roots-rock came from. (The new one, granted, is better than the last.) It’s as if Moore and Ranaldo required the frisson of sharing a band to push past the cores of their songs, while Gordon was simply waiting for a chance to float free.\n\nThe natural question, of course, is why Gordon has suddenly outstripped the rest of Sonic Youth. Perhaps she’s found a creative chemistry with Nace and a place where the two can try new approaches without the fear of failure, even when their sets fall apart (or never form at all). But that rationale feels thin for several reasons, not least of which is the implication that Moore and Ranaldo, especially, haven’t worked with interesting musicians in the interim. To the contrary, Moore’s current band features Shelley on the drums and My Bloody Valentine multi-instrumentalist Debbie Googe on bass. In the past three years, he’s issued recordings with Loren Connors, Mats Gustafsson, and John Zorn, and jammed with Merzbow and longtime collaborator John Moloney. Ranaldo’s collaborators have included John Medeski and Alan Licht. Such casts and company don’t exactly make you pity either songwriter.\n\nRather, in the scattered interviews that she’s given the last few years, Gordon has simply seemed more connected with the currents of the world around her. In a New Yorker feature last year, she dismissed the idea of worrying about studios or equipment configurations, a nod not only to Body/Head’s embrace of the clipped and distorted, but also to more modern and egalitarian modes of making music. A week ahead of that North Carolina show that never took off, she told me that the kind of music Body/Head made mattered now because people’s tastes had broadened due to the technology-aided spread of strange music and art. In an age of instant online access, she added, a stream was no surrogate for high-volume, improvised sound made to suit a certain situation and room. “You can see a clip,” she said, “but it’s not the same as being in the actual place and feeling the sound in your body.” Who has time to stand and deliver folk-rock songs, like Ranaldo, or try to relive past glories, like Moore, when that’s the way you see the world spinning?\n\nAnd maybe there’s a delightful bit of revolt against the “girl in a band” assumption Gordon faced for so many years, too. In that same New Yorker piece, Gordon spoke about the range of opportunities that Sonic Youth had afforded her. “Sonic Youth, for better or worse, is/was a machine that carried me along through pregnancy, motherhood, and creative opportunities I never would have achieved on my own,” she said. “I’m grateful and surprised that we were listened to, loved, ignored, and overrated.” But now with Body/Head, she’s going places Sonic Youth never did, unbound by the lack of frontmen and faces surrounding her. “Who made up all the rules in the culture?” she told Elle a few months later, tapping into another current involving Pussy Riot, rebellion, and power. “Men—white male corporate society. So why wouldn’t a woman want to rebel against that?” — Grayson Haver Currin\n\nNext: Ashley Paul's musical journey from a conservatory to the subway\n\nII: Ashley Paul: Personal Space\n\nPhoto by Ben Pritchard\n\n“I’m really protective of the feeling I have when I make music,” says songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ashley Paul. “It’s the only time I can tap into just making something purely for myself.” That sense of intimacy resonates on Paul’s new album, Heat Source, a mesmerizing set of sparse, restrained songs. Using primarily guitar, clarinet, and voice, she crafts patient-to-the-point-of-stasis music, with small sounds that seem to contain entire worlds. Perhaps her skeletal melodies could be fleshed into something bigger and busier, but they’d likely lose much of their tantalizing power.\n\n“There’s much more space on this album,” Paul explains. “This was a big year of change for me in general—a lot of life changes and feeling very scared. Perhaps making music was the only place where I was calm, and that could be reflected in the music.”\n\nIf music feels like home for Paul—she currently splits time between an apartment in Brooklyn and performances in Europe—that might be because it’s been part of her life for so long. She started playing piano at age 3, then moved to saxophone at 10. “My dad is a really good rhythm guitar player, and I grew up listening to Wes Montgomery and Paul Desmond records with him,” she recalls. “I wanted to play saxophone so I could play with my dad.”\n\nThat desire soon turned into an obsession, as Paul spent much of the next decade dreaming of a life devoted to saxophone—“being the next Paul Desmond,” as she puts it. She enrolled in the jazz saxophone performance program at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, and though she completed her degree, she was a bit disillusioned by the experience.\n\n“I had a lot of teachers pushing me in many directions. There is an idea of perfection on the instrument—they try to tell you what is the right way or the wrong way,” she says. “I wouldn’t trade my training for anything, but letting go of that pressure was a challenge. Everyone who goes through a conservatory education, if they’re going to continue playing music, has to let go of that stress.\"\n\nPaul’s initial way of letting go was to quit music entirely, and she spend a year studying jewelry making in North Carolina. What might seem like a radical turn actually had a connection to her previous pursuits. “Construction is something I’ve always been interested in,” she explains. “In jewelry-making you have to visualize the three-dimensional thing happening before you put it together, so that could be an influence on the way I make music.”\n\nPhoto by Susanna Bolle\n\nAt 22, Paul returned to music by going underground, literally. She moved to New York and busked on sax in the subway, inspired by watching her former classmate Matana Roberts do the same. Camped out at Manhattan's Columbus Circle station, she played two three-hour sets a day, paying her monthly $750 rent with the singles and change she collected. “I used to play a lot of Ornette Coleman songs,” she recalls. “It’s a weird exercise in trying to appeal to people, because no one really wants to be there. But you need them, so that balance of what to play and how to play was a challenge.”\n\nPauls’s experience in the subway cemented her commitment to music. “After a year of playing six to eight hours a day, I thought, I can’t give up on this,” she remembers. “I need to sort this out, I need to be playing music.” Turning away from jazz, she returned to the NEC to pursue a graduate degree in Contemporary Improvisation. There she studied and collaborated with Anthony Coleman, a mentor who still influences her creative process.\n\n“We almost never talked about music, we just did it,” she recalls. That intuitive vibe has since carried over into Paul’s many subsequent partnerships, which include duos with Joe Maneri, Loren Connors, Eli Keszler, and, most recently, Rashad Becker. “When I have to start talking about things I get kind of anxious,” she admits. “It’s a weird challenge for me to be myself . It’s something that I’ve struggled with. I came to finding what I do late in life, and it was a conscious struggle for many years.”\n\nIn the late 2000’s, Paul found a breakthrough in that struggle. Increasingly exposed to more and more types of music, she began picking up new instruments and learned how to record herself. “It all happened at once,” she recalls. “I was trying to make music and I was hearing things, and recording it all on Garage Band. It just opened up a world and I wanted to put it all down myself.”\n\nWith her vistas widened, Paul dove headfirst into songwriting, though to her it wasn’t such a leap from improvisation. “I was always drawn to people who improvise melodies rather than sounds,” she says. “That was always important to me, creating music rather than showing chops.” What did take some adjustment was the idea that she was no longer just a saxophone player. “I still get really nervous playing guitar and singing,” she admits. “If it’s just sax I don’t even think about it because I’ve been playing sax for 25 years, so it’s like another limb.”\n\nPaul’s openness to new tools and sounds has led her to create solo music that slips sneakily between categories. Parts of Heat Source sound like abstract sound art; others sound like fractured folk music; and yet other sounds like both. “As long as I’ve been putting myself out there as a musician, I’ve never really fit in,” she says. “I don’t know how to define myself. I don’t really feel bound by genres, so it is probably liberating, but it’s also the hardest thing about what I do.\"\n\nSuch challenges haven’t slowed Paul down. She’s been quite prolific recently; Heat Source is one of three new releases alongside two cassettes, White Night (on Important offshoot Cassauna) and 12,000 Seconds (on Kudos). All three were recorded over the course of the last year, and see her further mastering every phase of her music, particularly her mostly-improvised lyrics, which she describes as “a kind of outpouring—if I sat too much and thought about what I was writing, it wouldn’t quite fit.”\n\nHer singing has a nearly subliminal quality, as if she’s whispering directly into your brain. “I am a very harsh critic, and sometimes I’m terrible at singing,” she says with a laugh. “The voice is the only thing I’ll ever record more than once. That’s why I end up with two [vocal takes] on some songs, because I can’t decide between them.”\n\nBecoming more comfortable with singing and playing other instruments is a work in progress for Paul, but lately she’s embracing it all. She’s now writing songs with an eye toward performing them. Surprisingly, she finds that the personal space she so values when making music is even more accessible when she plays in front of people.\n\n“It’s easier to get to onstage, because you the lights are on you and everything else is in black, and you are forced to get there,” she says. “It's hard sometimes to achieve that in your living room. Life can be so distracting.” – Marc Masters\n\nNext: Cellist Hildur Gudnadóttir fashions a new instrument to fit her body\n\nIII: Hildur Guðnadóttir: Body of Cello\n\nAt the age of 32, cellist Hildur Guðnadóttir thinks she has found the project that will last her a lifetime. For years, she struggled with the realities of playing her acoustic instrument in an amplified setting. At times, the tone could be brittle or her dynamic range limited by concerns with feedback and audio engineers who simply didn’t understand her aims.\n\nBut then she met Ómar, a six-string electric variant on a cello that resembles a modernized viola de gamba and gives her a range of notes that stretch from a violin toward a bass. Like a guitar, it has pickups, making it less prone to unintentional feedback and the whims of live technicians. It’s thin, too, meaning she can strap it to her body and move around the stage, now unbound by the sit-and-bow strictures of her classical upbringing. It’s even small and flexible enough that it no longer needs its own seat on an airplane. It fits in her suitcase. (Hear it from a recent show in Japan here.)\n\nDuring “Heima”, from her wondrously idyllic and elegiac album Saman for Touch, Guðnadóttir plucks Ómar’s strings and sings softly over the instrument’s rise and fall. The sound suggests a more robust nylon-stringed guitar. Every note refracts into a series of muted reflections, decaying as though being bounced through an echo chamber. Guðnadóttir is actually sending the signal through two grand pianos, ad hoc resonating chambers that give the sounds a phantom feeling.\n\nIndeed, Ómar is designed to be played with a set of small resonating chambers placed throughout whatever room she plays, so that select frequencies create an immersive audio environment from her cello. In effect, one woman and six strings could approximate the swells and near-silence of an orchestra. It’s the start of a project that has no logical end.\n\n“It’s like an electroacoustic, surround-sound cello gamba,” Guðnadóttir says from Berlin, laughing at her own unwieldy description. “It embodies everything that fascinates me the most—acoustics, playing instruments, digital processing, movement of sound. Somehow, everything is combined in Ómar. I feel like I’m just starting my lifelong project.”\n\nYears ago, Guðnadóttir’s friend, the composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, asked her to accompany him live and essentially serve as a one-woman stand-in for a string quartet. The challenges of the task daunted her. She first said it wasn’t possible, but she began working with different ways of replicating and mirroring herself live, including looping pedals but avoiding pre-recorded tracks.\n\n“A string quartet is obviously violins, cello and bass, so how can one cello be all of those things at once?” she asks. “But now, I can actually be a string quartet myself with this instrument.”\n\nÓmar is the result of a partnership with Hans Johannson, an Icelandic instrument builder who has been crafting his own designs for three decades. He has even worked to create a “21st century violin,” which restructures the architectural principles of the very instrument itself. He’s the father of Guðnadóttir’s best friend, so he’s been mending her broken cellos for years. They ha discussed the idea—this “surround cello,” they called it—off and on for the better part of a decade. Nearly two years ago, he started building it based on a dialogue of how he thought the instrument could work and how Guðnadóttir hoped it would respond. The results, she says, are groundbreaking on several levels, from the physical design (Ómar is now a piece of luggage) to the integrated hardware (Ómar includes a set of onboard custom audio filters).\n\n“There’s a lot of electronic surround-sound music, and I’ve done a lot of work where I write music for other people to move around a space,” she says. “But this way of designing acoustic resonators for a single instrument, that’s pretty new.”\n\nPhoto by Rune Kongsro\n\nÓmar stems from a back-and-forth, and Guðnadóttir is an avid collaborator herself, having worked with Ben Frost, Pan Sonic, Hauschka, the Knife, and Valgeir Sigurdsso. She even tours and records with Stars of the Lid outpost A Winged Victory for the Sullen. That’s merely a sample.\n\nBut the new instrument gives Guðnadóttir greater versatility as a solo artist. A multiplicity of musical voices has been a consistent touchstone of her own work, and Ómar functions as a package of many instruments. The process to get there, though, was stepwise and slow.\n\nGuðnadóttir began studying cello when she was only six years old, but when she was a teenager, she began joining bands and obsessing over electroacoustic music. When she joined winsome Icelandic art-pop tinkerers múm, she put the cello aside and mostly sang. Later, she relocated to Berlin to study electronic music and programming; for a year, the only sounds she really considered were digital.\n\n“When you’re programming, you spend a week writing code, and then another week to get a ‘bleep,’” she says. “It can be a long and tiring process for unfulfilling sounds. So I picked up the cello again. I was so gratified getting instant sound.”\n\nGuðnadóttir subsequently headed to an isolated cabin in the woods of northern Iceland, where she used a small army of instruments to build her beautiful and filmic solo debut, Mount A. Though the music was remastered and reissued for a 2013 Touch release under her own name, Guðnadóttir originally offered it under the pseudonym “Lost in Hildurness.” She was too timid, she admits, to expose herself and her process in a public setting.\n\n“It was like getting to know yourself in a way that I’d never experienced, very personal,” she remembers. “I view music mostly as communication, so when I record, I’m communicating to the listener in the future. I felt the need to communicate this, but I was still shy about it. It was scary, like when you’ve been walking around in clothes and suddenly you’re naked.”\n\nBut she’s since shaken off that shyness, as her solo output has become at once increasingly audacious and intimate. The meditative pieces of 2009's Without Sinking were magnetic, pulling you toward the stable center of Guðnadóttir’s long-tone compositions. Some friends, including Jóhann Jóhannsson, lent assistance, but the relationship between Guðnadóttir and her acoustic cello took center stage.\n\nOn Saman, she’s almost completely by herself, though she’s added new tools. There’s the new electric cello, of course, and Guðnadóttir’s own voice, which she intertwines with her instrumental parts as though they’re complementary strands of the same DNA. From the foreboding and deep “Frá” to the mercurially fretful “Torrek,” the moods are deeper. Any hesitation that Guðnadóttir once had with communicating directly has vanished. At once, you see various phases of her past—the cello, the voice, the electronics—colliding into new possibilities. That’s the process that she wants to continue pursuing, likely with the help of her suitcase’s latest necessity, Ómar.\n\n“Singing is something that I have done all my life, but what I did on my first two records was to hide the vocals. They’re there to thicken the web of the cello,” she says. “But the vocals are getting onto an equal level with the cello now. The way it’s built, Ómar is becoming like my spinal cord, because he’s really wrapped onto me. And when you’re playing the cello, you’re hugging it, anyway, so you have the resonance in your body. When you’re sitting and playing at the same time, it’s very connected to you as a musician.” — Grayson Haver Currin\n\nNext: Three exciting young guitarists discuss the trappings of technique\n\nIV: Hands Have Memory: The Technique of Solo Guitar\n\nTechnique is a tricky thing in any kind of music, but it seems particularly slippery with solo guitar. The format has such a long, rich tradition that finding a new way to play is daunting. Technique can become a crutch—something to fall back on when ideas aren’t coming—but it can also handcuff, paralyzing with the anxiety of influence. How to find a novel approach to what’s been done so often?\n\nThe upside of technique is its power as a springboard. The best players launch from established styles toward uncharted ones, returning to touchstones as needed but never feeling bound to them. This process often includes questioning the term itself. What is technique? Adherence to rules? Expression of personality? Is it creating by overwriting—is it both a pencil and an eraser?\n\nTo help answer those questions, I asked three of today’s most interesting solo guitar players for their takes on technique and how it informs the music they make.\n\nMatthew Mullane\n\nMatthew Mullane thinks a lot about technique. For the past four years, while making his new album Hut Variations, “technique and all of its baggage consistently made its way into my working notes,” he says. Mullane sees two meanings in the term technique: What you learn and how you respond to that learning. “I think what is most exciting as a listener, and indeed as a player,” he continues, “is to allow these two techniques to meet—leaving a sonic trace of their incommensurability.”\n\nThe concept behind Hut Variations arises from what Mullane calls “this split in realms of technique… the irreconcilable split between self-cultivation and responsibility to the other.” As he explains, “The first technique is represented in the world left by the person who decamps to the hut. There the hut-dweller spends time cultivating style. If achieved, however, the style-seeker must then reckon with the guilt of incommunicable technique.”\n\nThose themes might not be immediately apparent on Hut Variations (released by Vin Du Select Qualitite, the label run by John Fahey biographer Steve Lowenthal). But you can certainly hear the tension between Mullane’s appreciation of traditional forms and his quest to discover something new. He’s capable of dizzyingly quick runs, but what impresses most is his patience—every note sounds purposefully-chosen and drenched in the immediacy of the moment. When Mullane switches from acoustic guitar to electric, his well-considered approach persists, modified to exploit the thickness of amplification.\n\nMullane had no formal training, but he did grow up in Northeast Ohio in what he calls “a house of guitars, mostly animated by folk-revival music of the 1960’s at the hands of my parents.” He got an electric guitar at age 9 and was immediately attracted to playing and listening on headphones by himself. “It had a worlding quality—the capacity to create a technical and sonic bubble,” he recalls. “That is really evocative for anyone at that age.”\n\nIn 2011 he made his first album for VDSQ as part of their solo acoustic series, which he describes as “centered on an extended piece using modular motifs as a launching point for improvisation.” The six pieces on Hut Variation are more composed, honed through “exercises in compositional abstraction.” The result is an album for which guitar technique can sometimes mean not even sounding like a guitar.\n\n“I think the most interesting \"techniques\" have emerged from trying to use the guitar as an interface channeling dissimilar objects,” Mullane explains. “This doesn't mean making the guitar \"sound like\" a piano or a saxophone, but rather interpolating guitar moves with the technical constraints of other objects, instruments and playing scenarios. In this way, the guitar has the capacity to be an instrument of thought. Imagining through the guitar, abstracting its seemingly rote mechanisms as having analogical power, keeps me coming back to it.” (Read the full transcript of our chat with Mullane here).\n\nCam Deas\n\nLike Mullane, Cam Deas sees technique as a two-sided coin. One side is simply about speed—the ability to dole out notes quickly and fill the air with sound. Though he once found this an important part of playing, “This holds no interest for me now,” he says. “It's sport, not music. I cringe every time I see a solo guitarist play almost entirely at breakneck [Leo] Kottke speeds.”\n\nFor Deas, the true value of technique lies in its other side: “total confidence and comfortableness with your instrument.” Here, the goal is to explore the instrument so that speed and prowess take a backseat to expression. “When you're really confident with your technique, you want those notes to sing out and have the space they deserve,” he explains. “When you listen to something like [Derek] Bailey'sBallads or the early Fahey volumes, every note is so perfectly executed it has to have its own space to breathe.”\n\nCam Deas: \"Quadtych Part One\" on Bandcamp\n\nThat kind of confidence abounds on Deas’ 2011 album Quadtych, a fascinating four-part, 70-minute suite that began as free improvisation. But over the course of performing it endlessly—Deas guesses he’s played the suite at least 70 times—Quadtych slowly became more structured, to the point of near-total precision.\n\nSuch musical immersion has been part of Deas’ life since childhood. Growing up in the suburbs of London, he remembers listening to his dad learn Erik Satie pieces on piano. He took classical guitar lessons in grade school, then studied music at the University of Sheffield. But he found himself often battling his teacher; once, when they argued about an assignment, the instructor snapped, “\"If you don't like playing Bach, you don't like playing music!\"\n\nEventually Deas ventured beyond solo guitar to study electronic composition. On his new album, String Studies (released on Alter Stock, the label of Helm’s Luke Younger), he continues that pursuit, processing and manipulating his guitar inside a fascinating, unpredictable sound-field. “I think of it as a musique concrete – the guitar is mainly important in regards to density and pitch, but the actual playing is so minimal as to allow space for the electronics to work appropriately,” he explains. “If you were to hear what I was playing on the guitar on it's own you'd think it was a joke.”\n\nThough String Studies is more abstract than Deas’ previous guitar-only pieces, he considers it his first narrative work. “I was interested in the movement of narrative and it’s approach to time and the universe,” he says, citing the influence of time-scale-based work of Olivier Messaien and Iannis Xenakis. It will be interesting to see if Deas eventually applies this approach to his solo guitar work – though he plans not to return to that form until he’s reckoned a bit more with technique. “When I'm ready to play solo acoustic guitar again,” he concludes, “it will be when I'm more confident in this area.” (Read the full transcript of our chat with Deas here).\n\nNorberto Lobo\n\nDeas and Mullane sound like they could talk about technique forever. By contrast, when I ask Portuguese guitarist Norberto Lobo what the term means to him, he replies with just three sentences: “A set of skills/methods one develops while searching for new possibilities/approaches. New ideas create new techniques, and vice-versa. Hands have memory.”\n\n“Hands have memory”: three short words that suggest a wealth of ideas. Lobo’s music has a similar effect. The six songs on his new album Fornalha are relatively simple in their basic structures. But Lobo constructs a universe of sound from his potent building blocks.\n\nPart of that expansiveness comes from Lobo’s knack for making pieces that feel both controlled and open. You get the sense that some serious forethought has gone into every song, yet it also seems Lobo could go any direction at any moment. It turns out composition and improvisation are equal partners in his creative process. “Compositions are like gateways to improvisation, and the other way around too,” he asserts. “Is improvising composing in real time?”\n\nLike Deas and Mullane, Lobo has been around music since childhood. “One of my earliest memories is my father teaching me how to whistle,” he says. He began playing guitar at age seven, following in the footsteps of older siblings. “I learned from my brothers, some friends, listening to records, seeing lots of gigs,” he says. “I am mostly self-taught, meaning I have a super lazy teacher.”\n\nLobo’s self-direction produces music that seems utterly boundless. On Fornhala, he shifts effortlessly from a sawing cycle to a finger-picked hop to a halting ballad. Tones and styles morph even within tracks, suggesting the flow of ideas in his head is a constant waterfall. “I guess most of the time the material chooses a sound for me,” he says. “It's hard, but it's also easy; it’s like a muscle that, if regularly exercised, keeps in good shape.”\n\nFraming creativity as a muscle suggests that Lobo prioritizes technique, at least as a vessel for expression. But it also seems that his musical workout regimen is more about the journey than the destination. “I don't know if I have \"my\" sound just yet,” he admits. “I’m still looking for it.” (Read the full transcript of our chat with Lobo here). — Marc Masters\n\nWhile debates about the value of music took many different shapes this year, free rap mixtapes, as a format, stayed the course. Though few consensus choices reigned over everything, the DatPiff delta gave way to exciting new sounds from all over the country. Here, we examine 22 tapes that might have slipped under the radar but still moved the needle—releases from well-known artists like Ty Dolla $ign, Future, and A$AP Ferg as well as fast-rising voices like BeatKing and Kehlani—in alphabetical order by artist.\n\nA$AP Ferg\n\nFerg Forever\n\n[RCA/Polo Grounds]\n\nI'll admit it upfront: Ferg Forever isn't as good as last year's Trap Lord, which continues to get better as time passes. But Ferg remains one of the most compelling new voices in rap, and he spends this tape experimenting. He's never less than engaging, sounding like nothing in this world makes him happier than rapping. The gravitational pull of his personality is massive, even if his production often fails to keep up—check his giddy, spot-on Ol' Dirty Bastard impression/tribute on \"Doe-Active\", and listen in awe as he attempts to buck the beat off of \"Fergsomnia\" with a performance that's as unhinged as a broken jaw. But his attention lies elsewhere these days, too, as evidenced by the sobering first verse on \"Talk It\", where he tries to make some sense of the recent killings of young black men across the country. —Renato Pagnani\n\nBeatKing\n\nGangsta Stripper Music 2[self-released]\n\nTo national ears, Texas has become so defined by its DJ Screw-oriented history—now in large part a memory as the final remnants of its physical mixtape trade wash away—that it's become difficult for artists from the state to develop a distinct aesthetic of their own. Houston rapper BeatKing's rise wouldn't have been possible without the Internet, and his willingness to play court jester with its many memes—an attention-grabbing approach that could even result in occasional great music. This year, though, he broke out as a solo artist beyond the trending topics. Succeeded by his Pole Sex EP and a strong collaborative album with Gangsta Boo, Gangsta Stripper Music 2 was the moment his sound really seemed to cohere: the improvised punchlines delivered with a straight face, production that seemed to take up physical space, and strong conceptual songwriting that reflected a glint of the humor that pervades his lyrics. Rude, crude, and undeniably bawdy, BeatKing's barrelling rap style hit without a wink, letting the jokes dawn on you in time delay. —David Drake\n\nChildish Gambino\n\nKauai\n\n[Glassnote]\n\nChildish Gambino: \"Pop Thieves (Make It Feel Good)\"\n\n\"III. Telegraph Ave. ('Oakland' by Lloyd)\", an infectious slice of straight-up R&B from last year's Because the Internet, offered a way forward for Donald Glover's musical project Childish Gambino. Glover uses that template as the foundation for Kauai, the second (and much better) half of his STN MTN / Kauai project. It's a savvy artistic move—Glover has never sounded as comfortable as he does here, revealing the kind of natural gift for songwriting that makes you wonder why he was so insistent on rapping in the first place. Now when he slips into MC mode on \"Retro (Rough)\", it not only feels earned but actually welcome, something that wasn't the case a mere 12 months ago. But it's the pure pop head-rush of \"Sober\" and the slick surfaces of \"Pop Thieves (Make It Feel Good)\", which nips at the heels of \"Telegraph Ave.\", that prove Gambino is finally discovering a voice of his own. —Renato Pagnani\n\nDoughboyz Cashout\n\nWe Run the City 4\n\n[CTE]\n\nDoughboyz Cashout: \"Boss the Fuck Up\"\n\nDoughboyz Cashout have not updated their official Twitter account in over a year and they presumably do not give a fuck that the fourth installment of their We Run the City series was basically critically ignored this year. The Detroit group is signed to Jeezy’s CTE label, but Jeezy doesn’t show up on the tape, which is made up of 75 minutes of raw but well-crafted humanist hustler music, more indebted to Y2K Mannie Fresh or Beats by the Pound than any of the dominant narratives in 2014 rap. Although, this year did make a pretty strong case for the enduring relevancy of the rap group: Migos and Rae Sremmurd deservedly dominated the radio, and Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan found inspiration in one another as Rich Gang.\n\nMany of the individual Doughboyz’ solo careers thrived this year, too—Big Quis’ My Turn, full of clever, workmanlike motivational anthems, was a highlight—but they’re at their best together on We Run the City 4. There are definitely hooks here (\"Boss the Fuck Up\"), and a bounce that sits somewhere between B.G. and YG. But the narratives are the glue, with plainspoken detail that perfectly cuts to the chase: \"My plans after high school simple, get scrilla/ My heroes ain’t wear no capes, they’re chinchillas/ Living in a city where a nigga with a job is a nobody, while the dealers treated like gods.\" Doughboyz are capable of making a crossover hit; with the right push, it could’ve been \"My Young Niggaz\" with Jeezy and YG, off last year’s CTE comp #ItsThaWorld 2. There’s actually a song by the same title on We Run the City 4, but its completely different, scrapping the DJ Mustard slickness for more Cash Money worship. Fuck a single. —Meaghan Garvey\n\nFuture\n\nMonster\n\n[self-released]\n\nFuture: \"Monster\"\n\nAfter the refreshing success of the Auto-Tune ballad \"Turn on the Lights\" and a highly publicized and envied-by-all engagement to Ciara, Future was recast as rap’s Fabio, a masculine heartthrob unafraid to let his guard down in the name of love. Then the R&B love story of our age dissolved, and Future reminded us he’s still the guy who once said, \"If that’s your hoe, that’s my hoe, too.\" The majority of Monster, released in October, finds Future shifting his own narrative back to the perpetually leaning, carnal-driven stoic street-rap fans fell for on early tapes like Streetz Calling and Dirty Sprite. He unapologetically showcases his indulgent narcissism (\"Fetti\", the title track), but as usual, it’s the rapper’s idiosyncratic and unpredictable approach to writing hooks and verses that keeps the tape from drowning. He floats over \"My Savages\" while reflecting on success and his incarcerated friends not there to see it in person. And on the arresting second half of the batshit \"Throw Away\", the tape potentially reveals its true identity as an angry and confused break-up record. —Wesley Case\n\nFuture\n\nNo Sleep\n\n[self-released]\n\nShy Glizzy: \"So Awesome\"\n\nThough No Sleep came out in 2013, it spoke to the trends of 2014 perhaps better than any other street mixtape from this year's rap calendar. The project was headlined by Future, but the real star of the tape was a then relatively unknown producer Metro Boomin, who did Future’s ghastly and excellent \"Maison Margiela\" and \"How Can I Not\". The tape showcased the young producer and featured lesser-known trap rappers: Casino (\"Killin Shit\"), Johnny Cinco (\"No Choice\"), PeeWee Longway (\"Sneakin and Geekin\"), Shy Glizzy (\"Awwsome\"). DJs and rappers enjoy boasting that they speak for \"the streets\", but No Sleep truly encapsulated the many disparate directions of trap rap even before the calendar year turned over. —David Turner\n\nK Camp\n\nIn Due Time EP\n\n[Interscope]\n\nLet’s address the unavoidable first: Atlanta rapper K Camp’s hummable hit \"Cut Her Off\" bested Chris Brown’s \"Loyal\" as this year’s ugliest ode to dismissive misogyny, an unendearing accomplishment to say the least. It would be disingenuous to ignore this, just as it would be dishonest not to admit K Camp can write one hell of a catchy song. On In Due Time EP, he does so repeatedly, whether it’s adrenalized instructions to turn up (\"Turn Up the Night\") or effortless love letters to his sole source of motivation (\"Money Baby\"). The hope is K Camp will shed the immature attitude toward women fast, while continuing to refine his strong pop-minded sensibilities. \"'Cut Her Off' is a great song because it's an emotion, and he's being true about it in that moment,” André 3000 said in an interview this year. K Camp has the melodic half of the battle won, which is enough to keep a skeptical eye on him in 2015. —Wesley Case\n\nKari Faux\n\nLaugh Now, Die Later\n\n[self-released]\n\nIt is hard to know what will cause an artist to break. The right co-sign, a hit song, and perhaps, in 2014, maybe just a Vine. Recent Los Angeles transplant Kari Faux, who got a boost being featured on Childish Gambino’s STN MTN/Kauai mixtape, is still trying to figure that much out. Laugh Now, Die Later, her brief, sharp, and mostly self-produced mixtape from earlier this summer, features a snarky and wise-cracking personality that feels unique, especially amongst the rap world. She best captures herself in the track \"No Small Talk\", about refusing to waste one’s time on lesser men and opportunists. The cover of Laugh Now, Die Later even includes a skull emoji in case her middle finger with a wink message was lost in translation. —David Turner\n\nKehlani\n\nCloud 19\n\n[self-released]\n\nThis was an undoubtedly great year for R&B; Beyoncé's solo debut, released at the very end of 2013, loomed large, a show of strength and power. At the level of radio, a counter-trend was the demure demeanor of Tinashe, whose Aquarius is one of the year's best R&B records, an encapsulation of long-gestating interest in the coy intrigue of millennial artists like Aaliyah. In an environment like this, an artist who stands against the grain is apt to get lots of attention.\n\nNineteen-year-old Kehlani Parrish is a Bay Area singer, dancer, and songwriter for herself and others. Her new and refreshing approach on the remarkably consistent debut tape Cloud 19 is one of bold sincerity and vulnerability. She's said it was a tape about falling in love, and it feels like it, stomach butterflies and all. While her approach is informed by the pop R&B hits of the early '00s, she also grew up a longtime fan of Lauryn Hill and neo-soul, and is in many ways more of a classicist than her peers. Yet her lyrics are written with the honest, upfront, down-to-earth perspective of a kid who has a preternatural understanding of the world her peers are living in. —David Drake\n\nKing Louie\n\nTony\n\n[Lawless]\n\nThough Chief Keef's explosion drew national attention, people were paying attention to the drill scene before he was a known quantity, and it was King Louie who was at the sound's center. His 2011-era work had a wide sonic range, a musical diversity that contrasted with a nearly single-minded focus on the kinetic behavior of bullets and blurred, brutal punchlines that snapped into place with unexpected rhythm. In many ways, Keef upped the ante, taking a disoriented sound even further into darkness; this year's Tony surged to meet that sound's energy, the beats seething with tactile surfaces and unpredictable motion, while Louie's verses rat-tat-tatted through the storm clouds for a feeling of unsettling, portentous energy. When the album lets a little sun break through near the end (\"Ambitions as a Rider\") it serves to humanize Louie, to hint at the stories playing out behind the music and let the album's heart show. The city responded in kind, making \"To Live & Die In Chicago\" its unofficial 2014 anthem, and ultimately garnered the attention of Drake, who has reportedly signed Louie to his OVO imprint. —David Drake\n\nKing Mez\n\nLong Live the King\n\n[self-released]\n\nIn the last decade the biggest rap names to emerge from North Carolina have been the duo Little Brother and, on a major scale, J. Cole. Both share a working class consciousness that's not lost on rappers in the state looking to follow their steps. Raleigh's King Mez explores those compassionate depths on Long Live the King. The producer/rapper’s approach is understated—he rarely raises his voice to express these concerns with this community and people. Instead he is comfortable allowing his word to carry his message and sit comfortably in the headphones of his listeners. —David Turner\n\nKool John\n\nShmop City\n\n[Shmoplife]\n\nKool John: \"RNS\" [ft. Jay Ant & Iamsu!]\n\nThe Bay Area-based HBK Gang dropped two big debut records this year with Sage the Gemini's Remember Me and Iamsu!'s Sincerely Yours. Along with Kool John's free Shmop City mixtape, it makes a strong argument that the Gang is in some sense the closest to the spirit of hip-hop's Bronx origin stories as any crew working today: party records with slumping beats, copious X-rated sex raps, and funny, arrogant punchlines. Like many Cali rappers these days, Kool John is often drawn to production that flips older Down South or West Coast gangster rap classics and rebuilds them in a Bay style; opener \"R.N.S.\", for example, is a redux of Juvenile's \"Gone Ride With Me\". The effect, though, isn't recreating the past as much as building upon it, using familiarity to anchor the unfamiliar. —David Drake\n\nLil B\n\nHoop Life\n\n[self-released]\n\nLil B: \"Fuck KD (Kevin Durant Diss)\"\n\nIn a year where Lil B fans insisted he follow through on his hoop dreams, the rapper obliged with Hoop Life, one of the most balanced and fun collections he’s released in years. Running with the basketball theme, he delivers this year’s biggest cross-culture kiss-off—\"Fuck KD (Kevin Durant Diss)\"—and sketches out an earnest account of his (mostly fictional) ascent to the NBA. While that dream fell short, with Hoop Life, the prospect of Lil B sticking to his day job(s) isn’t so hard to swallow. —Corban Goble\n\nLil Herb\n\nWelcome to Fazoland\n\n[self-released]\n\nLil Herb: \"4 Minutes of Hell Part 3\"\n\nThis was the year \"the underground\" died its thousandth death, when Vice killed DIY or something. But the underground never really dies, it just evolves—something fundamentally misunderstood by those who declared Chicago drill \"over\" this year. If anything, Interscope dropping Chief Keef was a blessing: It gave him carte blanche to pursue his increasingly abstract impulses, removing the weight of outside pressure to make whatever a Chief Keef radio hit in 2014 even means.\n\nAnd though the national spotlight has gradually drifted away from the Midwest since Keef’s 2012 crossover success, Chicago street rap felt as vital as ever this year. Scene mainstays Katie Got Bandz and Fredo Santana hit new strides, and GBE affiliate SD exceeded expectations on debut album Truly Blessed. But it was Lil Herb’s Welcome to Fazoland, a debut project two years in the making, that breathed new life into the drill subgenre. On the tape, Herb appraises his surroundings, absorbs its pain, and asks questions: Why am I still so drawn to violence, even as I recognize that it hurts the people around me? Why did I talk back to my mother, who had nothing but the best intentions? \"Why the cops hot on our block? Man, there’s violence everywhere!\" Claims that drill music lacks lyricism are officially put to rest: look no further than the hookless, blistering \"4 Minutes of Hell Part 3\". And though Herb may not have gotten the shine he deserved this year, his influence looms large: Nicki Minaj’s flow on Pinkprint bonus track \"Shanghai\" (not to mention \"Chi-raq\", her collaboration with Herb from earlier this year)? That’s pure Herb homage. —Meaghan Garvey\n\nMouse on tha Track\n\nAir Time\n\n[self-released]\n\nMouse on tha Track: \"Liberation (The Cut)\"\n\nFrom opening cut \"Liberation (The Cut)\"—a heartfelt concept record about the emancipatory power of cutting off his dreads—it's clear that rapper-producer Mouse on tha Track is doing things a little differently. The Baton Rouge-based artist came to acclaim through his beats for Trill Ent acts like Lil Boosie and Foxx, but the past few years his succession of solo tapes have been some of the most consistent in hip-hop writ large. This summer's Air Time is one of his best full projects to date, with unconventional sound effects, affecting melodies (\"Bye Bitch\"), and grooves unlike anything you've heard outside Louisiana. With the success of artists like Kevin Gates and Lil Boosie on the national scene, here's hoping the rest of the country acknowledges what real heads already know: Baton Rouge has some of the genre's most potent talent, and Mouse should be recognized among it. —David Drake\n\nRome Fortune\n\nBeautiful Pimp 2\n\n[self-released]\n\nRome Fortune: \"Money Memories\"\n\nRome Fortune might be the name attached to Beautiful Pimp 2, but its successes belong equally to CitoOnTheBeat, who produced the entire mixtape. His expressive and warm beats sound like he was born and raised in Atlanta and not New Jersey, and they fit Fortune like a pair of well-worn leather gloves. The result is 29 minutes of some of 2014's goopiest production, as if CitoOnTheBeat took a bunch of trap beats and let them roast in a slow-cooker for 12 hours. Fortune sinks into these surroundings, finding open pockets and using pauses, feints, and quick left turns to create an unpredictability that gives his laissez-faire rapping style a deceptive density. He doesn't tell stories or boast so much as spend the tape convincing himself his hard work will pay off; Beautiful Pimp 2 is rap as motivational speaking, generous and all-inclusive. The last words said here: \"Do you want to spend your life winning or being miserable?\" The morning after I heard that line for the first time, I hit the gym at 6 a.m. —Renato Pagnani\n\nShy Glizzy\n\nYoung Jefe\n\n[self-released]\n\nShy Glizzy: \"Mula\" [ft. 3 Glizzy]\n\nIn an era when rap co-signs could catapult unknown SoundCloud toilers to the Grammys, Washington, D.C.’s fastest rising rapper Shy Glizzy crafted a star-making turn the old fashioned way, with a Gucci Mane-inspired, appropriately titled street smash called \"Awwsome\". Before it reached Billboard, the single landed on February's Young Jefe, his strongest project to date. The tape displays the charismatic rapper’s increasingly effective sing-songy flow (\"Mula\", \"Medellin\") and penchant for memorable imagery (\"I made a snow angel from all the salt you throwin’\", Glizzy tells a hater). Most affecting is the reflective tribute to locked-up friends, \"Free the Gang\", which features the observant detail, \"We had some BB guns/ We ain't never used to wrestle.\" Jefe proves Glizzy didn’t simply catch lightning in a Styrofoam double-cup with \"Awwsome\". Months later, it—like most of Jefe—feels like a chest-pounding announcement of a promising arrival. —Wesley Case\n\nTravi$ Scott\n\nDays Before Rodeo\n\n[Grand Hustle]\n\nThough the exact boundaries of Houston rapper and producer Travi$ Scott's skill set are still being determined, know this: His fans fuck with it heavily. On Days Before Rodeo, a mixtape Scott released over the summer, you get a good sense of what he has working for him—dark, hard-snapping beats that work well in these post-Yeezus times and a flow that favors the starry-eyed shapes of Kid Cudi and Kanye's knack for stretching syllables. Songs like \"Mamacita\" give you a good idea of just why Scott's star has risen so quickly as the sonic elements—the shadowy, pulsing synths, a sample of a guitar screech, drums rattling like an ATM dispensing cash—pile up to deliver something promising. —Corban Goble\n\nTy Dolla $ign\n\nSign Language\n\n[self-released]\n\nTy Dolla $ign: \"Lord Knows\" [ft. Dom Kennedy & Rick Ross]\n\n\"Had her drinking and smoking on the tour bus/ Last year I remembered they ignored us,\" croons Ty Dolla $ign, the stoned genius responsible for the most fluid and exciting melding of rap and R&B since Drake, on \"Lord Knows\" from August’s Sign Language. While Ty’s big year will rightfully be remembered for his debut EP’s singles (\"Paranoid\", \"Or Nah\"), the 11-track Sign Language shows the accomplished musician’s ability to create a fully formed project meant to be experienced in its entirety. The record establishes its intoxicating insularity with minor-chord progressions, unexpected cameos (Dom Kennedy! Mike Posner! … Ed Sheeran?) and extended outros and interludes that seem to have minds of their own. The topics are familiar for Ty (\"Drank N Cranberry\", \"Missionary\", and the all-too-literal \"Stretch\"), but its his commitment and willingness to travel down these rabbit holes that makes Sign Language an encouraging precursor to Ty’s anticipated debut album, next year’s Free TC. —Wesley Case\n\nVarious Artists\n\nLobby Runners\n\n[self-released]\n\nReleased quietly at the tail of 2013, Lobby Runners was a primer on the freewheeling corner of Atlanta inhabited by Young Thug, Migos, Peewee Longway, and friends, whose degree of influence and amount of fucks to give were inversely proportional this year. Right from the jump, Thug lets you know how weird this thing will get, introducing the tape in a disorientingly crisp fusion of patois, bougie receptionist-speak, and the language of Based World over elevator music, in between hacking coughs: \"I want all of you guys to feel free, in the whole wide world, to come join the Lobby Runners. We running round the lobby, RUNNING ROUND THE FUCKIN’ LOBBY! OK. Bye.\" There’s \"YRN\", a Migos/Thug \"Mario Party\" cabana jam more compelling than just about anything on either tape Migos released in 2014. \"Ounces\" introduces Quavo’s fear of koalas, which he naturally rhymes with \"enchiladas.\" A cute, boppy MPA Duke and Skippa da Flippa song called \"Intro\" appears in sequence as track 16.\n\nBut novelty aside, this was a tape that housed \"Stoner\", \"Danny Glover\", and \"Get TF Out My Face\", not all of them as premieres but a perfectly curated collection nonetheless. It felt like a tipping point, a scribbled constitution of an Atlanta mini-movement often celebrated for its \"weirdness\" but defined more by the genuine camaraderie of its members. Thug shined and became a spotlight for his less-acclaimed friends; his Laurel and Hardy routine with Longway on \"Loaded\" was the perfect entry point for those unfamiliar with the latter (who coined the sweet, evocative \"running round the lobby\" mantra). Over the course of the year, there would be many permutations of \"new Atlanta,\" \"weird Atlanta,\" or whichever superfluous qualifier you prefer to effectively distinguish trap’s avant-garde from the old people; next year, there will be more. But there was something pure about this movement, even on tracks without much redeeming value beyond friends having fun bouncing ideas off each other. —Meaghan Garvey\n\nWoop\n\nWoop Lingo\n\n[self-released]\n\nWoop: \"HMC\" [ft. YG Ivy]\n\nThis year Rick Ross snuck out two major label albums to increasingly diminishing returns, but Orlando rapper Woop appears to be on the opposite trajectory. Both occupy an established trap lane, but Woop Lingo demonstrates that Woop knows how to maneuver within it. His high-pitched voice provides him an easy-to-overlook melodic quality that helps songs like \"HMC\" or \"Molly Mudd\" linger in one’s mind. The tape boasts known-quantity trap producers like Zaytoven or Sonny Digital, but Woop's nimble verses weave between their plodding beats in a way that few other rappers ever attempt. (He also had one of the best rock videos of 2014 with \"Rock Out Woop\".) —David Turner\n\nAustralian multi-instrumentalist, collaborator, and boundary-pusher Oren Ambarchi and veteran jazz pianist Matthew Shipp are two artists whose constant searching and boundless ambitions have made them perennial leading lights in the international avant-garde. Here, Grayson Haver Currin delves into Ambarchi's restless music, while Marc Masters talks to Shipp about how his style stretched in 2014—and how he thinks jazz itself should change too. (Follow us on Twitter and Tumblr for more experimental music news and info.)\n\nI: The Many Places of Matthew Shipp\n\n“How do you practice flexibility? I don’t know,” says Matthew Shipp, speaking on the phone from his home in New York City. “You want your fingerprint on everything but you want the music to mutate on its own, and I don’t think anyone knows how that happens. But there are ways to practice keeping an open mind.”\n\nThis year, Shipp found a new way to open his mind and renew his flexibility: by looking into his past. On his solo album I’ve Been to Many Places, he revisits pieces he had played previously with other musicians, chosen from a wide swath of his three-decade-plus career. The results are shot through with energy and invention. The challenge of interpreting songs from a new angle—including covers of George Gershwin and Roberta Flack tunes—clearly invigorated him.\n\n“When you replay pieces after not having played them in a while, it triggers things,” Shipp explains. “You refresh yourself about things that you did, ways that you thought, moves that you had at your control a long time ago.”\n\nShipp considers the process part of his continuing musical education, and in that regard 2014 was a particularly fruitful year. He also made new album with the Matthew Shipp Trio, his continuing unit with bassist Michael Bisio and drummer Whit Dickey. Root of Thingssaw the group expanding their approach while honing their control; there’s a subtle, near-subliminal touch to the album’s hypnotic tunes.\n\nShipp and Darius Jones; photo by Peter Gannushkin\n\nThere’s also a subtlety to The Darkseid Recital, a live album Shipp recorded with saxophonist Darius Jones. But here the energy is more unpredictable. Jones’ playing has a suspenseful abandon that spurs Shipp to some dizzying heights. Though the songs feel improvised, “we take an extremely compositional approach to the improvising,” explains Shipp. “We try to define some gesture from the initial attack that becomes the logic of that piece. We evolve it from there, but we stay close to the form of how we identified that initial attack.”\n\nAdd two Ivo Perelman albums in which he served as a sideman, and Shipp’s 2014 tallies as one his most impressive years to date. The ever-evolving pianist focused and stretched many of his considerable artistic strengths. “I’m not saying I’m a musical schizophrenic, but I have a lot of personalities,” he admits. “The challenge is to integrate those into what I would hope is a cohesive meta-personality—and keep many sub parts to that meta-personality.”\n\nThat personality is based on what Shipp often refers to as his musical language. “I guess what I mean by language is the organization of energy fields,” he says. “You’re trying to tell some type of story, and it has a syntax. Can you apply rules to it like a linguist might? Sure. But when I’m playing, I’m just trying to connect with something deep inside myself and put it out there on the keyboard.”\n\nFor Shipp, this playing is just as important when he does it alone as when he’s onstage. Though he doesn't quite rehearse in intense, unending sessions the way he did in his 20s, he still tries to practice every day. “It’s a very important ritual for me—it really gets me close to who I am and what I need to be doing,” he says. “If I miss a few days I start getting really depressed. I feel the need to renew my relationship with the instrument on a daily basis.”\n\nThat relationship began in 1966, when Shipp took up piano at age 5. He was inspired by the liturgical music he heard at the Episcopalian church his family attended in Wilmington, Delaware. By the time he was 12, he knew he wanted to live the rest of his life as a jazz pianist. “I had an uncle who was a pianist, and I used to listen to Chopin with him,” he says. “Then I remember seeing Ahmad Jamal and Nina Simone on TV, and deciding I wanted to be a jazz musician.”\n\nPhoto by Glen Tollington\n\nShipp spent stints at the University of Delaware and the New England Conservatory, but in both cases he logged much less time in class than he did practicing piano. Most inspiring was a two-year period of private study with Dennis Sandole, a former mentor to John Coltrane. He recalls being “utterly dedicated” to Sandole’s lessons, working on them 12 to 14 hours a day.\n\nAll the while, Shipp dreamed of moving to New York City. He remembers watching episodes of \"The Odd Couple\" and walking around downtown Wilmington imagining it was Manhattan. Finally in 1984, at age 23, he headed to New York with the intention of meeting contemporary players such as bassist William Parker. “I actually bumped into William the second day I was here, on 1st Street and 1st Avenue,” Shipp recalls. “I immediately went up and introduced myself and started talking with him.”\n\nShipp has since played with Parker countless times in many contexts, but their most famous and longest-lived project together came as members of the David S. WareQuartet. Formed in 1989, the group lasted for 17 years, employing four different drummers in that span to support the core of Ware, Parker, and Shipp.\n\n“It seemed like our destiny to be together; it seemed like it was a gift from the gods,” Shipp says. “I didn’t look at it as a sideman gig—it was David’s band, and I was respectful of that, but he gave me a lot of freedom, and it was such an integral part of my life.”\n\nThe Ware Quartet made a wealth of classic recordings, taking post-Coltrane ecstatic jazz to new heights and constructing a sonic signature that made their music instantly recognizable. “David really wanted that, and made it clear from the beginning that we were dedicated to his vision,” he says. “It wasn’t about being a journeyman; it was about all of us seeing one particular vision to the bitter end. I felt like I was in Led Zeppelin or the Who or something.”\n\nShipp’s comparison is apt, since the quartet’s longevity was more akin to the lifespan of rock band than jazz groups. Indeed, the Ware Quartet thrived in a late '90s atmosphere in which jazz figures often commingled with experimental-leaning rock types. Most jazz concerts I attended at that time were full of rock fans, and many fanzines geared toward underground rock—Forced Exposure, Opprobrium, Butt Rag, etc.—devoted significant space to improvised jazz.\n\n“That was a real alive time in a lot of ways,” Shipp recalls. “We thought we were reinventing jazz for a whole new culture. There might be some truth to that or we might’ve been talking out of our asses, but it was just a really exciting time. We would play with indie rock bands; it worked as a social gathering and it was just utterly, utterly cool.”\n\nThat crossover seems less common today. “In a weird way that ethos is still there,” Shipp says. “But it was a real tangible movement back then and that no longer exists, for many reasons.” For one, he cites electronica and other computer-based music, which siphoned fanzine culture, as did the rise of the Internet and blogs.\n\nShipp himself has adapted to electronica as well, recording and touring with Spring Heel Jack, which in turn led him to collaborate with J. Spaceman (aka Jason Pierce of Spiritualized). These excursions have been sponsored primarily by his most supportive label, Thirsty Ear, which he came to via Henry Rollins’ now-defunct 2.13.61 imprint. And those contexts have created new challenges for Shipp.\n\n“In situations like that I have to give up syncopation, and that’s hard to give up—it’s so basic to who I am and what I do,” he admits. “But that stretches me and makes me look at my own vocabulary in a different way. And there’s joy in finding out you can relate to other types of musicians.” That joy is clear on one of Shipp’s farthest-out efforts for Thirsty Ear, a noisy, uninterrupted 38-minute album by a one-off group with Pierce and Spring Heel Jack’s John Coxon called Black Music Disaster.\n\nMatthew Shipp Trio; photo by Jon Flanders\n\nLately, Shipp has been more focused on traditional jazz scenarios, and 2014 was a rather dark year for that form, at least if you believed the media, as a handful of articles disparaged or outright mocked jazz. Two in particular—a New Yorker“parody” credited to Sonny Rollins (though he had nothing to do with it), and a Washington Posteditorial claiming “jazz isn’t all that great”—rubbed Shipp the wrong way. “The Rollins article—I didn’t find that comical, I thought it was disrespectful. It’s like, Why?” he says. “And the Washington Post article, that was just stupid. That guy is just a moron.”\n\n“I don’t have a problem with people making fun of jazz because we jazz musicians take ourselves so seriously,” Shipp continues. “But if you’re gonna do that, give us something to think about.” Shipp cites the Twitter account and blog known called Jazz Is the Worst as an example of parody done right. “Whoever does that obviously knows jazz culture,” he says. “There’s some funny stuff there.”\n\nShipp himself has used the media to take on jazz, writing reviews for of records by Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett for The Talkhouse. He saw the assignments as chances to fire shots at the current state of the art. “[Jarrett and Corea] have obvious talents or they wouldn’t be where they are, but why in 2014 are they still on covers of magazines?” Shipp asks. “The obvious answer is because the jazz industry is a lazy industry. If jazz can’t create new stars, rather than relying on people who played with Miles Davis in the '70s, then it really does deserve to die.”\n\nShipp is outspoken about both the politics of jazz and politics in general, but his stances aren’t an explicit part of his music. “My aesthetic is metaphysical,” he insists. “I’m a human being, so I’m as upset as anybody, and I'm involved with action, whether it’s discussing things on social media or going out on the street. But I don’t deal with those type of things in the music. Besides, I feel the act of playing this music is a political act itself. It’s an act of defiance to do this in this society.”\n\nWhat does Shipp mean when he call his aesthetic metaphysical? “I try to create a cosmic landscape—a universe for people to get absorbed or lost in,” he says. “As Sun Ra would say, I’m trying to take pictures of infinity. At one level it’s intuition, but on another level it’s the actual construction of a universe or a realm of thought.”\n\nPhoto by Peter Gannushkin\n\nPart of this philosophy involves letting go. “I try not to think at all about the specifics of music when I’m playing,” he explains. “You can study a lot, but when you’re on stage, you try to forget what you know. The art of playing is hopefully a subconscious one where you let nature have its course through the instrument.”\n\nThe music will continue to course through Shipp in 2015. Though he’s discussed the possibility of abandoning recording completely, he already has two releases in the can for next year: a Duke Ellingtontribute record with his trio due in January on Rogue Art, and an album with his chamber trio called The Gospel According to Matthew and Michael on Relative Pitch out in April.\n\n“I’m always learning and I’m always surprised,” he concludes. “Even if something’s a failure, there are surprises and learning experiences. Anytime you play that’s the case, unless you are phoning it in. I’ve been accused of many things, but I’ve never been accused of phoning it in.”\n\n–Marc Masters\n\nNext: The restless ambitions of Oren Ambarchi\n\nII: Oren Ambarchi: Will Travel for Sound\n\nCrys Cole and Oren Ambarchi\n\nFor the moment, at least, Oren Ambarchi is at rest.\n\nA week before Christmas, Ambarchi, at home in Melbourne, Australia, admits that he’s feeling a bit sluggish. He and his partner, the sound artist Crys Cole, entertained friends the previous night, enjoying the holiday season, the warm evening touch of the continent’s young summer, and a rather rare extended span at home. Ambarchi travels as many as nine months out of the year, connecting scattered festival dates and recording sessions in continuous blocks. The strategy limits the number of long, laborious flights he makes in and out of Melbourne and increases his availability.\n\nThat said, he'll be pretty busy with other things for the next eight weeks: This afternoon, his 7-year-old son, Zekie, will get out of school for a break, meaning this might be his last chance to talk about work for a while. “It’s school holidays for about the next two months,” the 45-year-old Ambarchi says with a slow chuckle. “It’s going to be hard to get much of anything done until that's over.”\n\nBut Ambarchi doesn’t seem like the type who’s content with sitting still through summer vacation. In the last few years, he has emerged as one of the most prolific and busy experimental musicians in the world, with his range of projects, styles, and techniques expanding almost as rapidly as his output. Originally a drummer, his reputation now includes work as a focused guitarist, a conjurer of pure and enormous tones, a composer of grand ambitions, an insatiable collaborator, and a noise whiz. He’s relentlessly unsatisfied, too, a performer always looking for an excuse to break the bounds of his repertoire rather than fall into its rut.\n\nThough he’s known for overpowering experimental music and high-volume pieces that force the listener into a daze, 2012’s Audienceof One began with an earnest pop song. The keening falsetto of Paul Duncan cut James Blake-like figures over subtle strings and electronics.\n\n“It’s easy to make dark music, heavy music. I don’t find it that challenging. It’s more challenging for me to make something that’s song-based. I wish I could,” Ambarchi says. “I like the idea of being uncomfortable. I don’t like to do what’s expected all the time.”\n\nWhen he scoops his son up this afternoon, the start of the holiday will effectively mark the end of a year in which Ambarchi either released or played vital roles on nearly a dozen records, from his second collaboration with Keiji Haino and Stephen O’Malley as the obliterative power trio Nazoranai to his beautiful, globetrotting epic solo title, Quixotism. He’s recently premiered new commissions by Alvin Lucier and Iancu Dumitrescu, issued his latest trio recording with Haino and Jim O’Rourke on his own Black Truffle imprint, and completed a beguiling collage of field recordings with Cole. He has five albums prepared for 2015 already, including a duo record with O’Rourke and a double-LP performance of the colossal instrumental, “Knots”.\n\nJim O'Rourke, Oren Ambarchi, and Keiji Haino\n\n“I have to pinch myself,” Ambarchi admits of the opportunities his career has begun to generate. “I’m very fortunate to be able to even sit with these people and talk to them. The idea of someone like Alvin Lucier writing a guitar piece for Stephen O’ Malley and me? He’s been such a huge influence on my work for 20 years. To be able to work with the guy and see his methodology but, more, just to be in the room with him, I’m so lucky.”\n\nThe inclusion of luck implies a bit of modesty for someone who seems so dogged in his musical pursuits—especially someone who’s been so obsessed with sound for so much of his life. As a teenager in Sydney, he’d fall asleep listening to records by John Coltrane and Cecil Taylor; to wake him up for school, his dad would simply turn off the stereo. He stumbled into the archives of Impulse! Records as a Jimi Hendrix fanatic. He’d read about connections between the style of Mitch Mitchell, the drummer in the Experience, and Elvin Jones. One day, he found one of the many Coltrane records featuring Jones and took it home on a Hendrix-inspired lark. That’s when he made the decision to say goodbye to his mass of Rolling Stones bootlegs and studio albums. He needed more jazz.\n\n“I traded them for every Impulse! record I could find,” he says. “I became so into that kind of music, which led to Cecil Taylor and ESP at a pretty young age. All I wanted to do was listen to music. I never left my room.”\n\nAmbarchi eventually followed that attraction to New York City, where he was a yeshiva student by day and a club-bound teenager by night. He saw Taylor and Charles Gayle, bought as many records as he could afford, haunted the Blue Note and the Knitting Factory. In fact, between those two rooms, he discovered that jazz-based improvisation didn’t have to mean being confined to jazz traditions.\n\n“I used to see all these jazz guys lined up at the Blue Note on a Monday night. These sax players would be waiting to play one chorus,” he says. “I just didn’t see the point of that. But the experimental world was just so much more open.”\n\nAnd in turn, that world opened Ambarchi’s ears to sounds and places he’d never imagined. He saw Haino play at the Knitting Factory in the early '90s, for instance, and stumbled into John Zorn’s wider orbit of eclectic experimenters. An avid record consumer, he purchased a cassette called Eat Shit Noise Music, a bootleg compilation of mysterious Japanese acts issued by an offshoot of RRRecords. When he finally listened back home in Australia, the material blew open his mind.\n\n“I had to find every record that this tape was from, and it wasn’t easy,” he remembers. “There were only five or six PSF Records releases at this point, and somehow I managed to get them all.”\n\nO'Rourke and Ambarchi\n\nEvery two weeks, he would place another order from a distribution company in Osaka. The employees became so familiar with his interests that, when he suggested he might stop by on his way back to Australia from a Stateside tour with Zorn in the early '90s, they suggested that they build a tour for him. He was soon in Japan, partnering with some of the clandestine types who had piqued his interest through Eat Shit Noise Music. Maybe he’s right about that luck.\n\n“I immediately clicked with the people, the culture, the food, just the enthusiasm for the music,” Ambarchi says. “There was no philosophy or politics. It was just about sound and basking in the glory of noise. It was very ecstatic, and that really resonated with me. All I could think about was how could I get back there, and I’ve been doing that once or twice a year every year.”\n\nOne aspect of Japanese musical culture offers a telling glimpse into Ambarchi’s creative process. After World War II, “jazz kissa” emerged in Japanese cities as a way for listeners to experience the contemporary sounds of records they could not afford from performers who were unlikely to tour the country. Today, some remain as coffee shops or bars, but their real call to visitors is a highly nuanced (if sometimes enormous) record collection. Patrons sit, perhaps sip, and mostly consume records one a time.\n\n“The guy plays the record, while five people who might be strangers or might be friends nurse a drink and listen to the record at a really loud volume. No one talks. The side finishes, and it’s flipped,” Ambarchi explains, his speech audibly speeding with excitement. “I love going to Japan and doing that; it’s a ritualistic experience. It’s something that’s lost now because of technology or life, but it gives me this energy for the rest of the year.”\n\nThat steady surrender to sound defines Ambarchi’s approach. A perfectionist who admits that he’s distracted for days after a live performance goes badly, he keeps several projects in the works at once and for years at a time. In 2014, he released three records that he’d been pondering and tweaking for the better part of his son’s life. With O’Malley and producer and multi-instrumentalist Randall Dunn, he recorded Shade Themes from Kairos half a decade ago as a working score for a film by Belgian artist Alexis Destoop. They finally revisited the material and finished it, though the process of initially making that music had already helped to fuel 2012’s Audience of One and Sagittarian Domain.\n\nLikewise, he and Cole made field recordings of their personal lives together while Ambarchi completed a residency outside of Oslo. They’ve been sitting on the tapes for years, slowly turning them into what he calls “a document of how you love this person and you made this record together.” The two-side result is a wondrously warped listen, where tiny moments of candid conversation, makeouts and windy walks outside morph into surreal drones.\n\n“We push each other to do different things,” he says. “It’s really great to be able to work with someone you love and to be inspired and challenged by your partner.”\n\nThat search for simultaneous challenge and inspiration seems to be at the core of Ambarchi’s discography. It’s what makes him love playing with Haino, who shifts streams every time his trio with Ambarchi and O’Rourke begins to settle into a sound. Likewise, for Ambarchi, recording is a revelatory process where he can unlock something new, something unimagined. When he was making Grapes from the Estate a decade ago, he wanted to stack multiple guitar overdubs recorded at different speeds and in different tunings to two-inch tape and see what they sounded like when played back at one speed. The engineer at Sydney’s Big Jesus Burger studio was so bored he walked out of the sessions. But Ambarchi risked hours on the experiment.\n\n“When we played what I’d done back, it was otherworldly, much more beautiful than expected,” he says. “It excites you, so you want to keep pushing. It’s like a puzzle, and all of a sudden, there’s this weird element that ties everything together, makes it special. That’s something I’m quite addicted to.”\n\nThat feeling arrived for the new Quixotism, Ambarchi’s first LP on Edition Mego since Sagittarian Domain, with the unlikely addition of Japanese tabla player U-zhaan. Quixotism is an immersive record, the sort of long-playing affair you’d want to hear at complete attention while sitting in a jazz kissa. Strings and synths and drums wrap around a slowly shifting rhythm, like a medical gauze made of sound.\n\nFinishing the album turned into a worldwide expedition. More than two years ago, Ambarchi asked German producer Thomas Brinkmann to build a beat that lasted for 50 minutes or more and slowly evolved. He would then build layers around it. It eventually involved sessions with Dunn in Seattle, contributions from former Pearl Jam drummer Matt Chamberlain, the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra and British classical and improvisational legend John Tilbury.\n\n“I think that [lineup] is really perverse,” Ambarchi jokes.\n\nHe wanted to add tabla as a tribute to the late Robert Ashley, too, but the first attempt in Melbourne ended in total failure. He almost gave up, but he knew that, in Tokyo, O’Rourke would know how to fix it. Ambarchi sat on the record for a year and then approached O’Rourke with the idea. At dinner one night, O’Rourke said the best tabla player in Japan lived around the corner. They invited him over, and Quixotism suddenly had its magic piece.\n\n“He shows up at the studio with eight tablas, and he tuned each tabla to each string of my guitar. I thought, ‘OK, this is some serious shit,’” Ambarchi says. “Everything fell into place, and I knew that it would. I was just waiting for that moment.”\n\n–Grayson Haver Currin\n\nI listened to a lot of metal this year, and these are the albums I liked the most. To shift things up from previous round-ups, I've included my personal Top 25, along with separate selections from Pitchfork's metal contributors. At this point I'm hardly the only person covering metal at the site, so I thought it would be worthwhile letting those other voices have their say.\n\nI also included a list from Saint Vitus bar's Dave Castillo. I asked Dave, a close friend, to submit something because he's booked hundreds of metal and hardcore shows, and I was curious what stood out the most for someone in that position. Plus, I live in NYC, and his venue has provided a center for the metal scene here: Sometimes it's nice to step away from the laptop and remember the physical spaces that lured me to this world in the first place.\n\nSpeaking of which, I don't usually include books on these lists, but you should check out No Slam Dancing, No Stage Diving, No Spikes, an excellent oral history of City Gardens that came out earlier this year. The now-shuttered Trenton venue was important to me as a teenager—I saw a ton of shows there, including the Ramones (my first non-backyard hardcore show), an unexpected Descendents reunion, early Green Day sets, Bad Brains, Butthole Surfers, My Bloody Valentine with Dinosaur, Fugazi, countless hardcore gigs, Gwar (with my frightened kid brother), Skinny Puppy with Pigface and a bunch of goth kids from my college, a few too many ska-punk shows (for unexplained reasons), Shelter somehow, and dozens upon dozens of others.\n\nThat space, and its no-bullshit construction and philosophy, helped shape my life and the way I approached doing shows, and things in general. In 2014, I'm especially interested in these kinds of underdog spots—you've already read enough about CBGB's and the like, and it's worth exploring scenes that existed outside of major urban centers, the locales that held scenes together under one roof. This is one of those, the stories are insane, and the book's a treat.\n\nOnto the records.\n\n25. Planning for Burial: Desideratum [The Flenser]\n\nPlanning for Burial is the project of Matawan, NJ's Thom Wasluck. The mix of highly personalized doom, noise pop, and lo-fi post-metal on his second album brings to mind the '90s under-the-pillow noise of Twisted Village regular Luxurious Bags and the quieter, fuzzier work of Justin Broadrick's Jesu. As his moniker suggests, Wasluck goes into darker spaces, dealing with things like depression, loneliness, and jealousy—subjects you'd expect from music that sounds like it was recorded alone in a bedroom. On \"Golden\", the 16-minute closer, he offers a prime example of how to move from gentle acoustic strums to room-filling noise without hurting anyone's eardrums. It's like he was afraid to wake up his housemates.\n\nPlanning For Burial: \"Golden\" on Bandcamp\n\n24. Thantifaxath: Sacred White Noise [Dark Descent]\n\nOn their ambitious, abstracted debut, the hooded Toronto trio play complex black metal that feels like it was recorded in a hall of mirrors—tones are extended and distorted, rhythms shattered and frayed, the overall atmosphere like a twisted carnival. Think a street-punk version of Deathspell Omega or Blut Aus Nord or, maybe, a creepier Krallice with a penchant for flights into new classical. For all the layers of atmosphere and technical chops, though, this is immediate, melodic music: It's enjoyable getting lost in Sacred White Noise, then using the surprise hooks to pull you out of the insanity.\n\n23. Lantlôs: Melting Sun [Prophecy]\n\nGerman multi-instrumentalist Markus Siegenhort split vocals with Alcest's Neige on previous Lantlôs records; he goes it alone on album four, a pretty and still very sturdy collection that blends gorgeous, airy post-rock guitars and heavier, molasses drums with Siegenhort's bright, clear voice. Unlike Neige's flimsier recent work, Siegenhort maintains enough grit here (mostly in the drums) to remind you where the project originated. Ultimately, it's kaleidoscopic and progressive dream pop that often does sound like a sun melting. (Note: Despite the evocative album title, and the mention of post-rock, it sounds nothing like Sunbather.)\n\nLantlôs: \"Melting Sun I: Azure Chimes\"\n\n22. Wreck & Reference: Want [The Flenser]\n\nThe Los Angeles duo Wreck & Reference use a sampler, drums, and voice to express immense, apocalyptic rage. On Want they sometimes hint at a more fucked up and heavy Xiu Xiu, other times Prurient screaming at a wall, and now and again an elegant Godflesh. You even get what might be best described as \"Big Black-esque spoken word.\" Importantly, though, across these 11 spartan songs, they basically sound like no one else. (Of note: They have an entertaining Twitter feed, if you're into those sorts of things.)\n\n21. Mutilation Rites:Harbinger [Prosthetic]\n\nOn their second album, and first with Ryan Jones (ex-Today Is the Day, and a very good sound man/producer) on bass and second vocals, the gnarled New York band continued finding a way to cram raw black metal with considerably more hooks, swing, and overall compositional know-how than your average Darkthrone worshippers. (Like Jones, drummer Justin Ennis is also an accomplished professional sound person—I figure this is how they manage to play so loud without losing definition.) Where a lot of black metal in 2014 felt rote, Harbinger is more life-affirming than a suffocating collection with song titles like \"Suffer the Children\" and \"Gravitational Collapse\" should be.\n\n20. Atriarch:An Unending Pathway [Relapse]\n\nThe Portland band, fronted by shape-shifting vocalist Lenny Smith (the guy should have his own reality show), play forward-marching death rock that also cycles into doom, black metal, and punk. (There are dark, catchy songs here you could imagine hearing on vintage 120 Minutes.) At one point on their third album, An Unending Pathway, Smith sings: \"When I'm dead, bury me here with no casket or trinkets from life/ I’ll decompose into the Earth so the cycle is whole.\" It's a beautiful sentiment, and, importantly, you know he's not bullshitting.\n\nAtriarch: \"Entropy\" on Bandcamp\n\n19. Teitanblood: Death [Norma Evangelium Diaboli]\n\nThe chaotic Spanish duo Teitanblood's second collection of wall-of-noise blackened death metal (or whatever you decide to label a maelstrom) is satisfyingly overwhelming, but also entirely to the point: each track is akin to an uphill life/death struggle, with all the violent flailing you'd assume comes with that sort of experience. In this context, the occasional Tom G. Warrior-style death grunt rings like an actual death rattle, now and then a thrashy solo surfaces from the clamoring muck like an outstretched hand, and sometimes when a song ends you feel like you're the one who needs that sort of assistance. Honestly, it's difficult imagining the guys playing these shambling, suffocating songs more than once, but it's very enjoyable trying to figure out how they do.\n\n18. Gridlink: Longhena [Handshake Inc]\n\nLed by the shredded yowl of Jon Chang and Takafumi Matsubara's artfully complex guitar decompositions, the NJ/Tex./Japan grindcore group's swan song, like their previous salvos, found a way to locate a spot between chiseled violence and spit-shine beauty. On Longhena, 14 songs clock in at 22 minutes, but that doesn't mean there isn't time for a pensive ambient string piece amid the complex explosions. For some reason when I think of Longhena, I imagine it being placed somewhere in an art gallery.\n\n17. Krieg: Transient [Candlelight]\n\nKrieg's Neill Jameson is a prolific NJ-based American black metal lifer, a brainy former record store clerk writer who's made songs about American Psycho's Patrick Bateman and covered the Velvet Underground. He's been around for ages, seemingly always on the periphery. So it was kind of a surprise that his seventh album as Krieg, and first in four years, is a USBM masterpiece, one that comes almost 20 years into his discography. In part this is because Transient feels like a first. There's a punk black'n'roll feel—confirmed by a rollicking cover of Amebix's \"Winter\"—and an energy that eclipses anything he's done previously. But it's buttressed by his boundless invention—swirling power electronics before a massive hardcore breakdown, boozy post-punk, and, hey, a spoken word piece that pairs his Twilight cohort Thurston Moore with Integrity’s Dwid Hellion. I've booked a few Krieg shows over the years, and remember one time, ages ago, when I paired him with a nascent Liturgy, and watched Jameson down a bottle of honey before the show. That's always informed the way I heard his voice, and how he's figured out what he needs to do to keep things going.\n\n16. Agalloch: The Serpent & the Sphere [Profound Lore]\n\nAgalloch's fifth album is the Oregon dark metal group's gentlest—it takes its time with the hushed 10-minute opener and a three-minute classical guitar piece, and remains controlled and unhurried throughout. The record is definitely grand—there are dramatic upswings and echoes and double drumming—but in tone, an often whispering John Haughm and company are pensive, allowing more room for folk and less for blackened whatever. But, of course, when they do decide to howl into the wind, the shivers are even more pronounced, and Serpent suggests an elegant way for these guys to continue mutating around their central conceit for years to come.\n\n15. Diocletian: Gesundrian [Osmose Productions]\n\nThe long-running New Zealand war metal outfit Diocletian's third full length features what sounds like air raid sirens emerging from the black/death muck of the second to last track \"Beast Atop the Trapezoid\". It's a calming moment on an otherwise buzzing, blistering assault of a record.\n\n14. Eyehategod:\n\nEyehategod [Housecore]\n\nThe classic New Orleans group's first record in 14 years, which comes after Katrina and various personal tragedies, ranks with the best of their over-driven punked-up sludge blues. It's also the last record to feature drummer Joe LaCaze, who passed away in August of this year, a fact that's hard to grasp when you hear how alive he is on these recordings.\n\nEyehategod: \"Robitussin and Rejection\" on SoundCloud.\n\n13. Inter Arma: The Cavern EP [Relapse]\n\nLast year Richmond, Virginia's Inter Arma turned heads with their second album, Sky Burial, a collection that offered a gimmick-free mix of doom, Americana, sludge, groove metal, Southern acoustic ambiance, and filthy crust psychedelia. This year they packed all of that, and more, into one 40 minute song that will keep you glued to your stereo from start to finish. A very exciting band who'll hopefully continue with these sorts of curveballs.\n\nInter Arma: \"The Cavern\" on Bandcamp\n\n12. Morbus Chron:Sweven [Century Media]\n\nThe Swedish band's adventurous second collection features 10 songs focusing in one way or another on being stuck in an extended nightmare or astral projection...or something. It's not all that important you decipher that aspect of Sweven—the music's rich enough on its own. The patient, brainy, knotty collection finds the group moving away from their 2011 debut's old-school Autopsy nods to progressive death metal complete with mathy breakdowns, a black metal interlude or two, blazing solos, and tons of atmosphere. Because of the care in these compositions, it's an album best experienced whole, and it's one you can listen to a dozen times a day and continue unpacking. (If you end up being a fan, check out Tribulation from last year's list.)\n\n11. Primordial: Where Greater Men Have Fallen [Metal Blade]\n\nOn their eighth album, the Irish epic metal band's vocalist/iconic frontman A.A. Nemtheanga chews the vast soundscapes his band lays down behind him. You get eight songs stretching to more than an hour, and he never lags or phones anything in as he intones about Ireland's history, tyrants that oppress the common man, and giving your life for what you love, among other things (hell, there's a song called \"Wield Lightning to Split the Sun\"). It's a fist-pumping, call-to-arms performance that's made me think of a blackened folk metal Freddie Mercury now and again (why not?). If you at all care about nations and the people working hard to survive in them, this stuff will give you chills.\n\n10. Dead Congregation: Promulgation of the Fall [Profound Lore]\n\nThe Greek band's second full-length channels the old school death metal of Incantation and Immolation and makes it new. They're not rewriting the book, but they've managed to create another masterpiece of the form. They're a band as technically sick as they are able to create sick atmospheres, and when I saw them live recently, I caught myself staring with my mouth open, a dumfounded witness.\n\nDead Congregation: \"Promulgation of the Fall\" on Bandcamp\n\n9. Indian: From All Purity [Relapse]\n\nThe Chicago doomed sludge band's fifth record features even more feedback and noise than usual, courtesy of Chicago mainstay, Bloodyminded/Anatomy of Habit's Mark Solotroff. Otherwise they remain as single-mindedly focused (and as blown-out and nihilistic) as ever. On the back of 2011's great Guiltless and this record, I asked the quartet to headline my Show No Mercy showcase at SXSW last year—watching them live was like watching four very focused men beat something until it died.\n\nIndian: \"Directional\" on SoundCloud.\n\n8. Woods of Desolation: As the Stars [Northern Silence Productions]\n\nWoods of Desolation is the ongoing project of guitarist/bassist D. and a revolving cast of players. For his excellent third album as WoD, he got help from drummer Vlad (Drudkh) and fellow Australians, bassist Luke Mills (Nazxul, Pestilential Shadows) and vocalist Drohtnung (Old). On paper, the combination of pretty sky-melting guitars and depressive black metal vocals may bring to mind early Alcest and Deafheaven, but this is actually more reminiscent of vintage Katatonia, albeit recorded somewhere deep in the forest and after they somehow got into Explosions in the Sky.\n\nWoods of Desolation: \"This Autumn Light\" on Bandcamp\n\n7. Godflesh: A World Lit Only By Fire [Avalanche]\n\nThe best thing you can say about industrial metal giants Godflesh's first album in 13 years is that it sounds like a record they made more than 20 years ago. On it, Justin Broadrick and G.C. Green returned to their roots—1988’s Godflesh EP, 1989’s Streetcleaner, and 1992’s Pure—and managed to expand upon what they did best without losing any of the original burn.\n\n6. Blut Aus Nord: Memoria Vetusta III - Saturnian Poetry [Debemur Morti]\n\nEach year Blut Aus Nord release a record they show up somewhere on my year-end list with a description about how the project of French multi-instrumentalist Vindsval continues pushing boundaries. On his 11th full-length, this one featuring the live drumming of Thorns (Frostmoon Eclipse, Glorior Belli, Deathrow), he returns from the dark ambient and industrial offerings of the 777 trilogy with a proper black metal record—albeit, one clearly from the mind of a guy who's also made dark ambient and industrial albums. Every element, down to the light in the landscape on the cover, is in the right place.\n\n5. Nux Vomica: Nux Vomica [Relapse]\n\nFor their first record in five years, and first for Relapse, the crusty Portland-via-Baltimore doom band give us three punked-up, politically minded songs that reminded me of the best of Dystopia and Nausea while adding in unexpected elements (the fluttering guitar beauty of \"Reeling,\" the soaring ambient section of \"Choked at the Roots\") and stretching to 45 minutes. These very catchy, very inspired tracks already have the feel of classic anthems, and when vocalist Just Dave yells \"We must resist!\" or \"We stopped watching the news/ cause we couldn't take it anymore,\" it's very easy not only to yell along, but to remember that thoughts like this are what got you here initially.\n\nNux Vomica: \"Sanity Is for the Passive\" on Bandcamp\n\n4. Tombs: Savage Gold [Relapse]\n\nFrom intense frontman/band leader Mike Hill and on, the Brooklyn band Tombs is best described as “muscular,” but are otherwise difficult to pin down. The music is precise, heavy, and powerful, and they mix black metal, post-rock, noise rock, straight-up rock, and other elements into a specific, identifiable sound. (Imagine Unsane discovering black metal and copping to an interest in Joy Division.) It’s a style that's buffed to a shine on their third album, Savage Gold, which was recorded and produced by death metal legend Erik Rutan (Hate Eternal, ex-Morbid Angel). There’s a coiled intensity to these 10 songs, and Savage manages to feel both more stripped back and deeper than their also excellent previous work.\n\n3. YOB: Clearing the Path to Ascend [Neurot]\n\nThe Eugene, Oregon doom band and year-end list-regulars' seventh album consists of four instant classics clocking in at more than an hour. Their humble, shamanistic frontman and guitarist Mike Scheidt, who wrote this material after a divorce and decision to go off antidepressants, reminds me of J Mascis in his off-stage soft-spoken manner and on-stage six-string theatrics. The music itself is the usual blend of psychedelic and stoner rock, blues, and something more blackened, capped by Scheidt's powerful vocals. But this time out, the material feels especially classic (especially closer \"Marrow\"), and it's clear that Yob truly are one of America's great heavy bands, a group that should be much bigger than they are.\n\n2. Pallbearer: Foundations of Burden [Profound Lore]\n\nFor their second album, the Arkansas doom band recorded with Billy Anderson, who sat behind the controls for the classic Sleep oeuvre and has recorded seminal works for High on Fire, Melvins, Jawbreaker, and others. In an interview I did with Pallbearer co-founder/co-lyricist/bassist Joseph D. Rowland, he said Anderson told them he's never recorded a band that used so many guitar tracks—an element of Pallbearer's sound that explains the massiveness of Foundations, as well as how they saw Sorrow and Extinction's successes as an opportunity to deepen and strengthen their craft. This is an ambitious record that doesn't feel at all over-worked or stale, and while Extinction holds up beautifully two years later, Foundations is the stronger collection to the point that it almost comes across as demos for this new material. And where Extinction often felt like a solitary album—especially in its focus on death and mortality—Foundations is built for larger communal spaces.\n\n1. Thou: Heathen [Gilead Media/Vendetta/Howling Mine]\n\nWith their fourth full-length, the first since 2010's great Summit, the prolific Baton Rouge band Thou continue putting out important, enthralling music that combines their DIY approach with sludge, doom, and punk. (It's their fourth LP, but they've released more than 20 records when you count the EPs and splits.) Heathen is painful and raw, but melodic and transportive. There are throat-shredders like the 15-minute opener \"Free Will\", moody acoustic interludes (one's called \"Take Off Your Skin and Dance in Your Bones\"), and ghostly female vocals (courtesy of Emily McWilliams),\n\nOn their label's site, they mention that it's recommended if you like \"nature, the sensual world, sexual decadence, pain and ecstasy, actively experiencing the present.\" Summitreminded me of my mother's death, largely because she passed away the year it was released, but also because of the subtle funereal horns and its overall darkness. Heathen, though, for all its intensity, feels to me like an affirmation.\n\nThou: \"Free Will\" on Bandcamp\n\nHonorable Mention: The Soft Pink Truth: Why Do the Heathen Rage? [Thrill Jockey]\n\nOn Why Do the Heathen Rage?, Matmos' Drew Daniel applies his experimental house project Soft Pink Truth's lusty style to songs by Darkthrone, Venom, Beherit, Mayhem, Hellhammer, and other black metal outfits, incorporating guests like Antony, Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner, David Serrotte of the Baltimore vogue ball crew House of Revlon, and Locrian’s Terence Hannum. Snippets from gay house classics (and porn) also play a part.\n\nAs Daniel’s made clear in the past, SPT is a queer-focused project, as shown on this LP by his cover of Seth Putnam/Impaled Northern Moonforest’s “Grim and Frostbitten Gay Bar” and artist Mavado Charon’s cover illustration of corpse-painted men fucking and murdering each other. The liner notes feature a piece called “Confessions of a Former Burzum T-Shirt Wearer”, where Daniel talks about what it means to be a gay man as well as a fan of black metal—a genre with a sketchy, violent history that includes the murder of a gay man by Emperor’s Bård “Faust”, as well as the fascism of Burzum’s Varg Vikernes. As Daniel puts it, “Just as blasphemy both affirms and assaults the sacred powers it invokes and inverts, so too this record celebrates black metal and offers queer critique, mockery, and profanation of its ideological morass in equal measure.”\n\nIt's an album inspired by metal, yes, but it's also a metal album. Sort of. I gave it Honorable Mention because it feels like it deserves its own space. I did the same thing with Liturgy a few years back when they released Aesthethica. Sometimes an album feel too singular to add to a list. At least to me.\n\nI was also into Cult of Fire'sमृत्यु का तापसी अनुध्यान (Iron Bonehead) this year. I discovered it in 2014, but it came out last December, so I didn't include it. Here's a track:\n\nHere are the rest of the lists...\n\nZoe Camp\n\n10. EEL: Endless Fucker LP [Mind Cure/Konton Crasher]\n\nWho would’ve thought that a bunch of Pittsburgh-based Japanophiles packing would make one of the most enjoyable, hardcore albums of the year? Drawing heavily from pivotal Tokyo punk bands like Lip Cream and Gauze right down to the pronunciation, EEL’s potential status as the nation’s heaviest-leaning weeaboos is redeemed through their clever incorporation of outside elements—like power electronics and freakin’ CHAINSAWS—into one of punk’s frequently-overlooked, massively-underrated variants.\n\nEEL: \"Low Life // Dead // Violent Anarky // Bars Is Prisons // Who Kill Bum?\" on Bandcamp\n\n9.
