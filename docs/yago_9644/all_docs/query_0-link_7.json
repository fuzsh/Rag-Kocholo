        "text": "This has to be one of the best home made horror films I have seen. It has a miniscule budget, no acting talent whatsoever but has some really unique and unusual ideas. It appears to be the film-makers friends and family who take part in the film and have a good laugh along the way.\n\nThe plot revolves around some Hari Krishna aliens who arrive at the door of a party and subsequently morph (in the tackiest way possible) into hideous ghouls. We also meet a gang of redneck alien killers who only increase the amount of spilled blood and guts immensely.\n\nWhat made this film work for me was the enthusiasm that everyone appeared to have and the results that were achieved on such a miniscule budget. The FX are incredibly tacky and plasticy but can be quite ingenious given the limitations the folk involved must have had.\n\nYou really have to see this film to appreciate it as it has to be seen to be believed."
