        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n14 Mar 2024, 09:07\n\nCredit: Sky HISTORY/Getty\n\nChristopher Eccleston is set to swap treading the boards for a role as host of a new Sky show.\n\nThe former Doctor Who and Our Friends in the North star will present the new investigative history show, entitled The Guilty Innocent with Christopher Eccleston, which will premiere on the Sky HISTORY channel in May 2024.\n\nThe Guilty Innocent will see Eccleston examine two highly controversial criminal cases which captured the public’s imagination at their time and went on to spark major campaigns for social justice which continue to fascinate today.\n\nCelebrating his involvement in the new series, Eccleston said in a statement released today (14th March): “The pursuit of justice is a subject matter which has peppered my career with dramas that remain special to me and have, in their own way, swayed public opinion. The Guilty Innocent is another project which pursues justice, or the lack of it, through a new medium which has allowed me to explore another means of storytelling.”\n\nIn the first of two hour-long episodes, Eccleston will introduce viewers to the story of the arrest of minicab driver George Davis for the armed payroll robbery of the London Electricity Board in Ilford, Essex.\n\nThe actor will interview those who campaigned tirelessly for Davis’ release and for his conviction to be overturned. And in a TV exclusive, Davis will break his fifty-year silence with his first ever long-form TV interview.\n\nThe series will also examine the controversial case of James Hanratty, one of the last men to be hanged in Britain, for the murder of Michael Gregsten and attempted murder of Valerie Storie, in August 1961.\n\nEccleston will retrace the extraordinary twists-and-turns of this notorious case, and revisit the evidence which put Hanratty’s neck in the hangman’s noose on 4 th April 1962, sparking a concerted campaign to end capital punishment in the UK once and for all."
