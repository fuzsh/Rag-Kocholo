He also played the role of Malekith the Accursed in Thor: The Dark World.\n\nFandom\n\nOne of the things many people appreciate him for is his left wing politics. One Instagram post of his in particular, in which he calls the Queen of England - Elizabeth 2nd - a 'parasite in chief', is often referenced in relation to him, especially in memes surrounding the British Royal Family. Very much untrue jokes about him being the cause of Prince Philip's death in 2021, or that he's going to assassinate members of the Royal Family, have been posted.[1][2]\n\nBest Superhero related Hollywood Chris\n\nWhen the meme/debate as to which Hollywood Chris is best, usually between Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Chris Pratt (Starlord) and Chris Pine (Steve Trevor)), some fans will adamantly bring up it's obviously Christopher Eccleston (Malekith the Accursed), in part due to his previously mentioned politics, and especially when compared to those of Pratt's.[3]\n\nChristopher Eccleston - Ao3 tag"
