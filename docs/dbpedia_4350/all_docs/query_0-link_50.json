Christopher said he was enjoying meeting the fans and was pleased that his Doctor was remembered so fondly. He indicated he would be open to discussing a project with Big Finish.”\n\nHe went on, “Then the pandemic happened and time moved both quickly and very slowly. Over recent months, ideas have been exchanged and discussions had. I am so pleased that Christopher has decided to return to the role with us – and I’m excited to welcome him to the Big Finish family as we discover the new adventures of the Ninth Doctor.”\n\nChristopher left the franchise after just one season playing the popular character, which is something he’s come to regret doing.\n\nRecently, Christopher admitted that while he was on the show, he was very ill and battling anorexia."
