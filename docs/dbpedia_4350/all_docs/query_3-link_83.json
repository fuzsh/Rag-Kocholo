        "text": "Since 1990, Christopher Eccleston has been busy growing his filmography. In his career to date, the British actor has appeared in numerous well-known (mainly English) series productions. The year 2005 marks a special date for all fans of the fantastic genre. Here Eccleston took on the role of Doctor Who in its ninth incarnation in the hit BBC series of the same name.\n\nChristopher Eccleston was interested in acting from a young age. After his training at an acting school, he made his professional debut in a production of Tennesse Williamsâ€™ A Streetcar Named Desire. He has also appeared on stage in the role of Hamlet.\n\nEccleston is known for miming complex characters in film productions outside the mainstream. But the actor also feels at home in blockbusters like Thor: The Dark Kingdom. In the Marvel adaptation from 2013, he can be seen as Malekith."
