        "text": "by Hayley Charlesworth\n\nChristopher Eccleston is my Doctor. Sure, I grew up watching re-runs of all eight Doctors before him, having previously identified Patrick Troughton as my favourite, but Eccleston was the first Doctor for my era. He was a Doctor from Manchester, so he shared my accent. And he was, to use his favourite word, fantastic. Often overlooked due to the immense popularity of David Tennant and Matt Smith, due to his short tenure and less than amicable exit, he was nevertheless remarkable. Along with Russell T Davies and Billie Piper, Christopher Eccleston was responsible for bringing back an old science-fiction show that in many people’s eyes had become a joke, and not only having people watch it, but made it once again the BBC’s biggest show ever. It was a risk to bring back Doctor Who, and in lesser hands, it may have failed, but Christopher Eccleston is too immense a talent to let that happen.\n\nIf we set aside a hokey, childish Slitheen two-parter, Eccleston’s 13 episode tenure was uniformly brilliant. While it took the first few episodes to find the tone it wanted to set, his series combined a winning sense of silliness and fear, child-like wonder and very mature themes. The Ninth Doctor was the first to mention the Time War, and was in fact the Doctor that was born from that war’s devastating end (at least until the 50th anniversary). One of Eccleston’s major strengths was presenting the Doctor as an embittered war survivor, but a man who is still fun, exciting, and ready and willing to save the world yet again. His masterclass at this is the episode Dalek. Marking the only time in the whole reboot that the titular creatures have actually been terrifying, the episode features a scene where the Doctor faces down an abandoned and chained up Dalek, creating the show’s most tense battle with only words. It is a scene in which we realise just how alike the Doctor and a Dalek can be, and Eccleston’s performance is simply out of this world.\n\nHis series also included the introduction of Rose Tyler. Long before the Ten and Rose romance show, Rose was a capable and wonderful assistant, the very person to bring the Doctor back from the unimaginable horrors of the Time War. With the addition of Mickey and Captain Jack Harkness, we had the first Team Tardis of the reboot, with an enjoyable dynamic and lots of hilarious banter between the Doctor and Jack. And in Steven Moffat’s first script, before he decided to overcomplicate everything, we see the truly terrifying gas-mask people, one of the only villains of the reboot to not be annoyingly overused.\n\nWhile Tennant and Smith have their strengths, I am of the opinion that the Tenth Doctor gradually became a parody of the character he was intended to be, while Eleven’s stories drastically dropped in quality towards the end. Eccleston’s fewer stories may be one of the reasons why he doesn’t have the same popularity, but at the same time, it also means his Doctor never became stale. And with his excellently handled regeneration, he says what we’re all thinking when he tells Rose, “you we’re fantastic. And you know what? So was I.”"
