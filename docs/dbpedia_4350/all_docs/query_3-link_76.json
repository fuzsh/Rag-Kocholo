From Time Lord to the Son of God, Shakespeare’s Iago to Derek Bentley in the film Let Him Have It, his roles have been numerous, often thought-provoking, gritty and challenging.\n\nA regular role in the TV series Cracker in the early 1990s brought him to the public’s attention and led him to appear in programmes such as Our Friends in the North, Hillsborough and Clocking Off. His film career has included Danny Boyle’s Shallow Grave, and he has performed alongside several leading actresses such as Cate Blanchett in Elizabeth and Nicole Kidman in The Others.\n\nOn stage Christopher has played roles in Miss Julie, Electricity and Hamlet which have brought him critical acclaim.\n\nHe became known to family audiences as Dr Who when he starred in the BBC series broadcast in 2005 and for which he received the Most Popular Actor award in the National Television Awards.\n\nA highly regarded actor, Christopher has twice been nominated in the Best Actor category at the BAFTA Television Awards, was Best Actor at the 1997 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards and the Royal Television Society Awards and won the RTS Best Actor award for a second time in 2003.\n\nMost recently Christopher has appeared in the edgy ITV thriller, Safe House.\n\nChristopher will discuss his life and work with The Watermill’s new Artistic Director, Paul Hart.\n\nTea and cake will be served in the bar after the event.\n\nThe restaurant will be open for lunch before the event.
