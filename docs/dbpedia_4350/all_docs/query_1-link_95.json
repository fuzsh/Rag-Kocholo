Such factors as a child's developmental skill set and toy popularity help determine the enjoyment levels of a product.\n\nThese factors are also considered in labeling a product with a 'best age range.' While many children may enjoy products at different stages of their development, this rating is our suggestion for an age range which will best enjoy the product.
