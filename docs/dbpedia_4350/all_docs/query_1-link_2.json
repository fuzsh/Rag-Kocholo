He really achieved big screen prominence with his expert portrayals of the dour, almost psychotic accountant in the snarky thriller \"Shallow Grave\" (1994) and the titular stonemason in \"Jude\" (1996), directed by Michael Winterbottom, as well as the plotting Duke of Norfolk in the Oscar-nominated Best Picture \"Elizabeth\" (1998).\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n91% King Lear\n\n89% Young Woman and the Sea\n\n88% My Name Is Leon\n\n87% 28 Days Later\n\n84% The Others\n\n84% Elizabeth\n\n84% Let Him Have It\n\n81% Jude\n\nPhotos\n\nChristopher Eccleston THE OTHERS, Christopher Eccleston, 2001, (c) Dimension Films SHALLOW GRAVE, Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston, 1994, (c) Gramercy Pictures JUDE, Kate Winslet, Christopher Eccleston, 1996, arm in arm JUDE, Christopher Eccleston, Rachel Griffiths, 1996. ©Gramercy Pictures SHALLOW GRAVE, Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston, 1994, (c) Gramercy Pictures SHALLOW GRAVE, Christopher Eccleston, Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, 1995, (c) Gramercy Pictures SHALLOW GRAVE, Christopher Eccleston, 1995, (c) Gramercy Pictures SHALLOW GRAVE, Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston, 1995, (c) Gramercy Pictures JUDE, Kate Winslet, Christopher Eccleston, 1996, ring toss game GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, Christopher Eccleston, 2000, (c) Walt Disney SHALLOW GRAVE, Ewan McGregor, Keith Allen, Christopher Eccleston, 1994, (c) Gramercy Pictures PRICE ABOVE RUBIES, Renee Zellweger, Christopher Eccleston, 1998 SHALLOW GRAVE, Christopher Eccleston, Kerry Fox, Ewan McGregor, 1994, (c) Gramcery Pictures JUDE, Christopher Ecceleston, Kate Winslet, 1996, (c)Gramercy Pictures LET HIM HAVE IT, Christopher Eccleston, 1991 SHALLOW GRAVE, Ewan McGregor, Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston, 1995, (c) Gramercy Pictures THE SEEKER: THE DARK IS RISING, Christopher Eccleston, 2007.
