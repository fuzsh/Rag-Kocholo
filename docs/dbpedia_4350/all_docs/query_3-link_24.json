        "text": "Christopher Eccleston (b. 1964) is an English actor perhaps best known as playing the Ninth Doctor on Doctor Who. He also had a recurring role on the NBC series Heroes, appeared in the films Gone in Sixty Seconds, 28 Days Later and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and narrated a documentary about Albert Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in the ITV documentary Best Ever Muppet Moments, talking about his memories of the Muppets.\n\n“I think really it was the brilliance of the writing. The puppets were great, but the scripts were extraordinary.”\n\n“I loved Bunsen, the mad scientist, who was forever exploding Beaker.”\n\n“Gonzo was a great character because Gonzo was like all of us: wanting to be great and was forever nearly killing himself. It was kinda tragic comedy, too.”"
