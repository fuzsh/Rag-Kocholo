        "text": "Christopher Eccleston did not hold back as he reflected on his strained working relationship with Mark Strong.\n\nThe former Doctor Who star performed with Cruella actor in BBC drama Our Friends in the North, which also starred the most recent James Bond, Daniel Craig.\n\nBroadcast in early 1996, the nine-parter told the lives of four friends living in Newcastle over a period of more than 30 years, covering major historical events like the miners’ strike and the Great Storm of 1987.\n\nChristopher, 58, played Nicky Hutchinson who returns home after volunteering for the US Civil Rights movement to mates Tosker (Mark) and Geordie (Daniel), as well as former girlfriend Mary (Gina McKee).\n\nTalking about the critically acclaimed series, which was adapted from a play penned by Royal Shakespeare Company writer Peter Flannery, Christopher revealed there was tension on set between him and Mark.\n\nNot mincing his works, Christopher said: ‘We detested each other. We really did not like each other at all.’\n\nHe continued in the interview with the BBC: ‘It was very interesting for me, because I didn’t like him as a person, and he didn’t like me as a person, but I admired him so much as an actor.’\n\nHowever, the Legend star went on to say that their mutual dislike did not affect the production, explaining: ‘We were professional, we weren’t sabotaging or hijacking, because we had so much respect for Peter Flannery and the project.’\n\nChristopher also said that the frostiness helped their performances as their two characters often rubbed up against one another, although they were able to put aside their differences on set.\n\nClashes between different personalities ‘happen in life’, Christopher added, while explaining that actors don’t necessarily always bond, comparing it to working in an office.\n\n‘It’s like going to the office. There are people in the office you don’t get along with,’ he added.\n\nHowever, Christopher heaped praise on Mark’s performance, saying it was the ‘best’ in the drama.\n\nSince Our Friends in the North, Christopher went on to be a Time Lord and also appeared in Safe House, The Others and 24 Hour Party People.\n\nMark, meanwhile, has forged a career in Hollywood films, starring in the likes of Zero Dark Thirty and Kick-Ass.\n\nMetro.co.uk has reached out to reps for Mark Strong for comment.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Doctor Who’s Christopher Eccleston shares love for Ncuti Gatwa in rare reference to role: ‘I loved playing him’"
