        "text": "Thunderdome\n\nThunderdome is a FanFare series where our writers good-naturedly debate some matter of pop culture and then leave it to the readers to decide. Read each post and vote at the bottom!\n\nOn March 26, 2005, Christopher Eccleston made his first appearance as the Ninth Doctor in Doctor Who. A mere three months later, on June 18, he exited the TARDIS and was replaced by David Tennant. It was a remarkably short tenure, partly because the BBC didn’t know whether the revived show would be a hit or not, and partly because Eccleston, who nonetheless enjoyed playing the part, had issues with key crewmembers and creatives over the course of filming.\n\nTo date, Eccleston is second only to Paul McGann in terms of the shortest amount of time spent playing the Doctor (John Hurt’s War Doctor doesn’t really count in this case, as he was deliberately written to be a one-off character). And yet, his impact on the show was huge, and persistent fan affection is one of the reasons he agreed to return over a decade later, in audio form (the other main reason, as the actor bluntly stated when answering viewer-submitted questions online, was the well-paid nature of the gig)."
