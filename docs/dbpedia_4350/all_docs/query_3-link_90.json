        "text": "At 7.05pm on March 26 2005, five minutes after we’d first heard the new remix of that spine-shivering Radiophonic Workshop “woo-hoo” title music, the Doctor spoke his first word on TV for nine years. As terrified shopgirl Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) was attacked by plastic mannequins in the basement of the London department store where she worked, a mysterious stranger (Christopher Eccleston) rescued her by taking her hand and saying “Run!”.\n\nFollowing a breathless chase, a severed arm, an elevator explosion and the bluntly delivered news that “Wilson is dead”, introductions were eventually made: “I’m the Doctor, by the way. Nice to meet you, Rose. Now run for your life!”\n\nNow we can relive it all again on the 15th anniversary of that franchise-reviving comeback. On Thursday evening at 7pm UK time, to entertain fans during the coronavirus lockdown, there’s a worldwide rewatch of that relaunch episode, titled “Rose”. It’s available on BBC iPlayer or Netflix, so find it and press play at 7pm. Former showrunner Russell T Davies will join in and live-Tweet along to the show, providing a running commentary and sharing his memories of the production.\n\nDavies has also promised special surprise extras to sweeten the deal. The first is the release on the show’s official website of Rose: The Prequel, which Davies describes as “a lost piece of history from the 50th anniversary year in 2013”.\n\nIt should all be a comforting trip down memory lane in these strange, suitably sci-fi-esque times. It also provides the ideal opportunity to reappraise Eccleston’s Tardis tenure and remember exactly what he brought to the beloved role.\n\nThis Doctor was very different to the ones we’d seen before. No flamboyant frock coat or flowing curls, just a black leather reefer jacket and a crewcut. No actorly RP accent but a definite Mancunian twang. This was a more rough-and-ready, action-primed portrayal for a new millennium.\n\nThe time-hopping hero had previously been seen on our screens in Paul McGann’s 1996 one-off telemovie. The last proper series, starring Sylvester McCoy, was even further back in 1989. In the intervening years, Doctor Who had fallen out of fashion and become a kitschy laughing stock, mainly remembered for its quaint wobbly sets and shonky special effects.\n\nWe tend to take Doctor Who for granted nowadays but this big-budget primetime revival, masterminded by Davies and BBC Wales, represented a huge gamble. Did anyone care about such arcane geekery as sonic screwdrivers and Tardises anymore? Would the reboot work? Would ratings be respectable?\n\nHappily, it was a surprise hit, pulling in a record-breaking 10.8m viewers and winning over a whole new generation, thanks in no small part to figurehead Eccleston. Fans loved his rugged take on the classic character, and he won an armful of awards that year, including the viewer-voted National Television Award for Best Actor. The sci-fi franchise was re-established as one of the BBC’s beloved crown jewels and remains so today.\n\nIt was all the more startling, then,when Eccleston’s bravely candid memoir, I Love The Bones of You, revealed six months ago how miserable he was during this period. He was struggling with life-threatening problems behind the scenes, suffering from depression, body dysmorphia and anorexia. The actor described himself as a “lifelong body-hater”, saying he was “very ill” with an eating disorder while filming Doctor Who.\n\nIt casts the entire Ninth Doctor era – Eccleston’s early departure after a single series, fans’ frustration with him, the fact that he’s since been omitted from anniversary celebrations, accusations that he’s been ungracious and ungrateful about the role since – into a whole new light.\n\nThese poignant revelations are also a great shame because Eccleston was truly extraordinary in the role. Indeed, he was arguably the most important of the latter-day Doctors. Perhaps it’s time for an overdue appreciation of what he did.\n\nAged 40 when he was cast, Eccleston had carved out a reputation as one of our most reliably brilliant home-grown actors. He’d first made his name as the controversially hanged Derek Bentley in the film Let Him Have It, and in Danny Boyle’s directorial debut Shallow Grave. On TV, he’d starred in such credible dramas as Cracker, Hillsborough, Clocking Off and Our Friends in the North.\n\nHe’d just worked with writer Russell T Davies on underrated ITV miniseries Second Coming, as a humble Mancunian video store worker who suddenly realises he’s the Son of God. It was this similar role – otherworldly but down-to-earth, an everyman hero with extraordinary abilities – which enabled him to beat his main rivals for the Doctor Who role, widely thought to be Bill Nighy and Alan Davies.\n\nChoosing a straight actor of Eccleston’s stature for the role signalled the BBC’s intent to cast off Doctor Who’s pantomime reputation and position it as drama, not light entertainment. Davies said Eccleston’s hiring “raised the bar for all of us”.\n\nPretty much everything about his stripped-back portrayal was designed to break from the show’s past. The stark all-black costume – in hindsight, a little like an EastEnders hardman – matched the edgy realism for which Eccleston was known. This was no astro-dandy, it was a hard-bitten hero. When Rose questioned his Salford accent with “If you really are an alien, how come you sound like you're from the North?”, the Doctor replied: “Lots of planets have a north.”\n\nEccleston consciously reigned in the eccentricity because, as Davies said, “He travels in time and space, he’s got two hearts, he’s a Time Lord – that’s eccentric enough to be getting on with.” Eccleston’s portrayal was more intense and serious because that’s what was needed to sell audiences the show’s high stakes once more.\n\nEccleston’s Doctor was just alien enough, though. He was a manic ball of energy. A force of nature with fire in his belly and steel in his eyes. There was an undertow of grief to the character, who we learned was fresh from the Time War which saw the destruction of his species. This was a damaged soul with survivor’s guilt, who became incandescent with rage when he met his arch-enemies, the Daleks, again. Eccleston conveyed all this with utter conviction and formidable screen presence.\n\nYet, with a goofy sense of humour and the ability to be frivolous, nor was Eccleston an intergalactic miseryguts. He was gradually softened by his burgeoning bond with Rose and rediscovered his wanderlust by seeing the wonders of the universe through her eyes. He was initially wary and stand-offish, insisting “I don’t do domestic”, but ultimately embraced her family. He loved chips, human foibles and said “Fantastic!” at every opportunity.\n\nHe danced joyously around the Tardis with Rose in wartime two-parter “The Empty Child”/“The Doctor Dances” (arguably Eccleston’s finest hour, written by Davies’s successor as showrunner, Steven Moffat) and gave an infectiously uplifting cry of “Everybody lives!” when saving humanity at the episode’s climax.\n\nHis chemistry with Piper reset the template for the relationships between the Doctor and his companions. Eccleston even managed to carry off the cheesy line “I think you need a doctor” before kissing her. He brought warmth, wit and wisdom back to the role, in the process breathing new life into it.\n\nSure, there were duff stories and unconvincing monsters – the living plastic, the farting bodysnatchers, the Anne Robinson “Anne Droid” – but that was the writing’s fault, not Eccleston’s, and he pulled off any patchy material with whole-hearted grit. On the positive side, there were meetings with Charles Dickens, the gas-mask zombies, the head-spinning “Bad Wolf” twist and some epic confrontations with the Daleks.\n\nAfter just 13 episodes, though, came Eccleston’s shock departure, which has come to unjustly overshadow everything else he did. The precise reasons for his early exit still aren’t clear. As the new book conveys, he was unhappy in his private life, exacerbated by being overworked and exhausted by the relentless filming schedule. He wasn’t used to the attention such a role would bring and there were rumours Eccleston didn’t agree with how the show was run.\n\n“I think it’s more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left on principle,” he later said. The BBC put out a press release saying he “feared becoming typecast” without consulting Eccleston, which understandably annoyed him. The Corporation was forced to apologise and handled the whole thing clumsily.\n\nThe BBC also admitted they had broken an agreement not to disclose publicly that Eccleston only intended to do one series, although Davies later pointed out that his star’s contract was for one year because it was uncertain whether the show would last longer. It will be fascinating to see what light he sheds on all this during the live tweet-along.\n\nThe truth is likely to involve a combination of all these factors, but Eccleston’s pivotal contribution to Who history shouldn’t be understated. As he later said: “The most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it broke the mould and helped to reinvent it. I’m very proud of it.”\n\nSo he should be. Together with Davies and Piper, Eccleston breathed new life into the dusty old franchise and made it a crowd-pleasing part of the pop cultural landscape again. Ratings for his series settled down at around 8 million – figures that the BBC would kill for now.\n\nSure, the Doctors who came after him, David Tennant and Matt Smith, had broader appeal to a youth audience, but no audience would have been there without Eccleston laying the foundations. The Ninth Doctor might have only lasted 13 episodes but they’re among the most important 13 episodes in the show’s 56-year lifespan.\n\nNow 55, Christopher Eccleston has been one of our finest screen actors over the past three decades but seldom gets the credit he deserves. In the words of the man himself, he was fantastic. Tonight, we have a chance to remind ourselves just how fantastic he really was."
