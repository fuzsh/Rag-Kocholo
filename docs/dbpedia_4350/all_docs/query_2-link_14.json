        "text": "Doctor Who has brought joy to millions of viewers and many of its stars have spoken fondly about their time on the series including David Tennant, Jodie Whittaker and current Time Lord Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nThe BBC sci-fi show began in 1963 and during that time has welcomed many actors into the unique universe, but unfortunately, a few of them haven’t enjoyed it completely.\n\nChristopher Eccleston has spoken candidly about what he didn’t like about being the one in control of the tardis from 2005.\n\nThe actor was the lead star in the rebooted show but left after just one series despite being popular with the fans, which left people speculating as to why. He claimed to the Guadian that the BBC mishandled the situation.\n\n‘What happened around Doctor Who almost destroyed my career,’ the 60-year-old told The Guardian.\n\n‘I gave them a hit show and I left with dignity and then they put me on a blacklist. I was carrying my own insecurities as it was something I had never done before and then I was abandoned, vilified in the tabloid press and blacklisted. I was told by my agent at the time: “The BBC regime is against you. You’re going to have to get out of the country and wait for regime change”.’\n\nHe later told The Radio Times: ‘My relationship with my three immediate superiors – the showrunner, the producer and co-producer – broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered.’ Speaking at a 2023 For the Love of Sci-Fi convention, he told the audience that he’d return to the show only if creatives, including showrunner Russell T Davies were sacked (via Den of Geek).\n\nBillie Piper – his companion on the show – recently told The Independent she now knows about his struggles: ‘I now know that he was having a hard time, but I’m not sure I understood at the time how troubled he was with it all.\n\n‘I was going through a lot of personal stuff – I think that’s where my focus was,’ she added.\n\nHe isn’t the only actor to not have only joyous things to say…\n\nCarole Ann Ford\n\nCarole was there at the very start of the Doctor Who phenomenon taking on a role in the debut episode.\n\nShe played Susan Foreman for two years before departing ‘incredibly annoyed’ and leaving acting entirely shortly after.\n\n‘They told me Susan was going to be an Avengers-type girl – with all the kapow of that – plus she would have telepathic powers. She was going to be able to fly the Tardis as well as her grandfather (the first Doctor played by William Hartnell) and have the most extraordinary wardrobe. None of that happened,’ she explained to the Telegraph.\n\nShe quit after finding her storylines, such as always being saved, ‘repetitive’. Carol, 83, is jealous of the women who’ve come after her: ‘How I envy them when I look at what they do, and what I had to do. They do get very sexy, don’t they? I never had such fun in my time.’\n\nCarol also found that after leaving the show, everybody wanted her to play another version of Susan but she wanted to try different things. She believes that Doctor Who destroyed her screen career ‘in no small way’.\n\nTom Baker\n\nThe longest-serving doctor Tom enjoyed most of his seven years, but felt that series boss John Nathan-Turner ‘diminished’ him towards the end.\n\n‘He made assumptions about how I should do things, or what lines meant, or how it should be shot, which diminished me, and I found that unbearable,’ he shared in an interview for the Doctor Who: The Collection – Season 12 Blu-ray set (via Digital Spy).\n\nThis included changes to his costume, such as the addition of question marks on his collar, which Tom, 80, described as ‘insufferably vulgar and cheap’.\n\nTom’s last series aired in 1981, but he did return for the 50th anniversary episode of Doctor Who. On set, he felt only Matt Smith was welcoming: ‘Nobody else bothered with me at all. I was a bit nettled about that.’\n\nMary Tamm\n\nSimilar to Carol, Mary, who died in 2012 aged 62, felt that her character went in a different direction than where she initially hoped it would.\n\nFrom 1978-1979, she played the doctor’s companion Romana, who she wanted to be an equal to Tom’s doctor, and not a damsel in distress.\n\n‘They said, “She’s going to be just as powerful as the Doctor”. It did work for a while, but it was only a half-hour format and you’ve got to have somebody who’s explaining what’s going on to the audience, so inevitably I ended up saying, “Oh, what’s that, Doctor? Why, Doctor?”‘ she told The Independent.\n\n‘After 26 episodes, I thought, ‘It’s not going to go any further.’ I’d had enough by then and I decided to leave after that one series.”\n\nPeter Kay\n\nComedian Peter Kay only appeared in one episode, but it’s remembered often for the wrong reasons.\n\n2006 Love & Monsters centres on a group of doctor enthusiasts who want to track him down, but the group is intercepted by The Abzorbaloff, played by Peter, who has more sinister ambitions. The Abzorbaloff – a monster that was designed by a nine-year-old child who won a Blue Peter competition -wants to absorb his physical body and knowledge.\n\nSome viewers criticised it for seeming like a parody, and for not featuring David and Billie’s characters very much. Even Peter doesn’t have a glowing review of his starring role – he went as far as to call it the one regret of his career in an interview with the Express.\n\n‘I loved making it but when I saw it, I thought, “Oh my God. I’m big green lizard running around Cardiff? Is that it?”\n\n‘It’s nice to have been in Doctor Who but that is regarded by fans as the worst episode ever,’ he mused.\n\nHowever, the always-optimistic star, 50, added: ‘In 10 years’ time, I’ll be able to do the Doctor Who conventions and charge people a tenner for a photo!’\n\nRobert Glenister\n\nIn the widely praised 1984 episode The Caves of Androzani, Robert played Major Salateen. He worked alongside the Fifth Doctor, played by Peter Davison, to launch an assault on Jek – a masked outlaw.\n\nDespite the highly-rated appearance he said: ‘I still get people outside the stage door with that picture of me looking about 12 and I am appalled at myself every time I see it. I looked like a complete berk and wish I never had to see it again.’\n\nThe experience certainly didn’t put him off though, Robert, 64, was back as Thomas Edison in Night of Terror, alongside Jodie.\n\nBillie Piper\n\nBillie played Rose Tyler between 2005 and 2006 and found starring on the show ‘uncomfortable’ due to the level of fame it gave her.\n\nSpeaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, she said: ‘It made me really famous again in that sort of mainstream fame way that I find really uncomfortable.’\n\nDiscussing why she left in 2006, Billie, 41, added: ‘I think that played into it but also I was just at the beginning of my acting career.\n\n‘As much as I love that show, I love Rose Tyler, Russell T Davies and all the people that I continue to have a relationship with, I wanted to do different stuff. I didn’t like the responsibility of being a sort of role model.’\n\n‘I was in my early twenties and quite wild. And then you’re the face of a family show. I found that really hard,’ she admitted to co-star David on his podcast.\n\nThe actress did choose to come back to the show in 2008, 2010 and 2013, and is still open to appearances, showing she does have a lot of love for the show despite her struggles.\n\nDoctor Who is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Billie Piper knew Christopher Eccleston was ‘struggling’ during Doctor Who filming\n\nMORE : People are convinced another epic Doctor Who crossover could happen after jaw-dropping photo"
