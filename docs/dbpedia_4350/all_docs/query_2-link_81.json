        "text": "Although it has been some years since Christopher Eccleston donned his black leather Jacket as the Ninth ‘Doctor Who’ if does not mean that he has been forgotten.\n\nRecently Eccleston who is starring in a BBC drama series about Autism, which is titled ‘The A Word’ got to meet one of many of his Autistic ‘Doctor Who’ fans.\n\nGerard Groves who has Aspergers Syndrome, which is a milder form of autism clinically refereed to as High Functioning Autism got to meet and share his story with Christopher Eccleston who plays the Grandfather in ‘The A Word’.\n\nAn apprentice at the BBC Gerard Groves spoke with Eccleston to help promote the actor’s role in new drama series.\n\nEccleston who played the Doctor in one season of ‘Doctor Who’ was visibly moved by Gerard’s recollections of his childhood, and how a certain ‘Doctor Who’ inspired him to become a filmmaker.\n\nYou can check out the video of Eccleston and Gerard Groves below:\n\nAs explained above Aspergers Syndrome is a milder form of Autism. A person with Asperger’s can integrate into mainstream life, but will still sometimes run into difficulties with subtle things such as a persons facial expressions or being able to read a persons body language. Autism is a developmental condition that effects 1 in every 100 people. The condition varies from person to person, which essentially means that once you have met one person with Autism you have met one person with Autism. People with the milder form of Autism can often be thought of an eccentric by their peers.\n\nYou can learn more about Autism at: www.autism.org.uk\n\nYou can watch the first episode of ‘The A Word’ on BBC iPlayer. The series airs every Tuesday at 9PM."
