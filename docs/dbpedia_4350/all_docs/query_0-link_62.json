        "text": "'United are in my blood. I was born in Salford, about a mile from the ground. And it's a family tradition; my dad Ronnie went to see them from the Thirties.\n\nSome of my earliest memories are of my dad talking about the Babes, specifically Duncan Edwards. 'He was a man at 16,' he always said. He was a great guy but kept his feelings to himself, but at any mention of that team he suddenly became filled with emotion.\n\nMy mum was an Old Trafford trolley-dolly. She used to push a trolley round the inside of the pitch selling Bovril. Just recently she said, very casually, 'When we finished work we used to see Duncan standing at the bus stop after the game eating fish and chips.' Can you imagine Ryan Giggs doing that? My dad would talk about them as players while my mum talked about their personalities, like 'Roger Byrne's very good-looking but you can tell he's moody'.\n\nMy dad took me to my first match: Bristol City at home in October 1973. It was a night match, which made it even better. If I ever have a son myself I'll try and take him to a night match as his first game because it's more magical. I remember feeling my dad's hand on my shoulder, everyone looking serious, the ground being all concrete and ugly, how huge the arena was, and never having seen grass so green in all my life. Bestie played and had a penalty saved. I'm convinced Denis Law tried a diving header and we lost - at home to Bristol City!\n\nThe result was a letdown but it was just so exciting to go. That was the relegation season. People these days won't appreciate it but for many years after that United were the underdogs, until we finally won the league in 1993. Us being the underdog was one of the attractions of supporting United in the Seventies and Eighties. City always turned us over; we were the joke of Manchester. We have enjoyed our success in the Nineties because it took so long to come.\n\nI don't enjoy the Old Trafford experience as much any more because of a lack of atmosphere. Everyone now has to sit and success has attracted a different kind of supporter. It's big business now and corporate entertainment has killed the atmosphere. Roy Keane was bang on with his comments about 'prawn sandwich eaters'. I loved Roy for saying that. However, it's inevitable that United have sought to become more of a global brand than a football club and that has contributed to our success.\n\nWhat keeps me wedded to the club is the hard core of homegrown lads like Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, the Nevilles, David Beckham - Beckham's an honorary Manc because he's been at the club since he was 12 - who have a sense of the club's history. That makes United a little bit special.\n\nI've worked with both Eric Cantona on Elizabeth and now Denis Law in The King And Us. I had a problem working with Eric because I'm totally against celebrity casting. I can't blame Damon Albarn, Vinnie Jones and Eric Cantona for taking the roles but 90 per cent of my profession are out of work all the time, so casting people like that is wrong and unfair.\n\nCantona was very nervous. I thought, 'the last thing Eric needs is a trainspotting United fan around' so I didn't chat to him much. But I found out later he liked some of the stuff I'd done because it was a bit out of the ordinary. So I regret that. I would like to have gone on the beer with him and kicked a ball with him.\n\nFavourite player\n\n'Paul Scholes; not Best, Law or Cantona. He's a local lad, he plays with his heart and he cares about the club. And he's got it all. He can hit the ball, pass, score goals, has tremendous bottle and he's got vision. I love that in a footballer. It's great to be a striker but I always enjoy the players who create.'\n\nFavourite game\n\n'Juventus away in the semi-final second leg of the Champions League in 1999 was magnificent. Two-nil down after 10 minutes, then Roy Keane decided \"Fuck this, we're going through', scored our first goal and turned the match. We were all kept behind at the end for 90 minutes and had finally stopped singing in exhaustion when Alex Ferguson emerged from the tunnel, walked up the touchline and clenched his fist. I loved him for doing that.'"
