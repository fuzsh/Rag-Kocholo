It is further described as “an upstairs/downstairs story of roughnecks and wildcat billionaires fueling a boom so big, it’s reshaping our climate, our economy and our geopolitics.”\n\nMoore will appear in the series regular role of Cami, described as “wife to one of the most powerful oil men in Texas and a friend of Tommy Norris (Thornton).”\n\n“Demi Moore is an iconic and extraordinary talent,” said Chris McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios. “We are thrilled to have her join Billy Bob Thornton and the star-studded cast of ‘Landman,’ our next epic series from Taylor Sheridan.”\n\nThis marks the latest major TV role Moore has taken on recently. She currently appears in “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans,” the second season of “Feud” from Ryan Murphy. Moore is primarily known for her work in film, including starring in popular features such as “Indecent Proposal,” “Ghost,” “G.I. Jane,” and “A Few Good Men.” She will next be seen in the feature “The Substance” alongside Margaret Qualley.\n\nMoore is repped by CAA, Untitled Entertainment, Gang Tyre, and The Lede Company.\n\n“Landman” recently kicked off production in and around Fort Worth, Texas. Sheridan and Christian Wallace co-created the series and executive produce. Sheridan executive produces under his Bosque Ranch Productions banner, which is currently under a rich overall deal at Paramount Global. David Glasser, ​David Hutkin, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari also executive produce via 101 Studios.
