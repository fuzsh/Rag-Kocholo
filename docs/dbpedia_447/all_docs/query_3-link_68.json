        "text": "What Is Demi Moore's Net Worth?\n\nDemi Moore is an American actress and producer who has a net worth of $200 million. Demi Moore has been one of Hollywood's top actresses since the early 1990s. She has received two Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress and, at various points in her career, has been one of the highest-paid people in the business. Outside of hefty acting paychecks, Demi received $90 million in cash and real estate in a divorce settlement with Bruce Willis. She has also earned a fortune through real estate transactions over the years. More details about both those sources throughout this article.\n\nDemi began her acting career with minor roles in films like \"Blame It on Rio\" (1984) and \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1985) before landing her breakout role in \"Ghost\" (1990) opposite Patrick Swayze, which earned her a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nMoore continued to star in successful films throughout the 1990s, such as \"A Few Good Men\" (1992), \"Indecent Proposal\" (1993), and \"Disclosure\" (1994). She became known for her willingness to take on challenging and controversial roles, as exemplified by her performances in \"G.I. Jane\" (1997) and \"Striptease\" (1996).\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Moore has been involved in producing films, including the \"Austin Powers\" series. She has also been recognized for her philanthropic work, particularly her support of organizations that help women and children in need.\n\nAfter a hiatus in the early 2000s, Demi returned to acting with roles in films like \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\" (2003), \"Bobby\" (2006), and \"Margin Call\" (2011). She has also appeared in television series such as \"Empire\" (2017) and \"Brave New World\" (2020).\n\nFilm Salaries & Highest Paid Actress\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Demi Moore became the highest-paid actress in film history (up to that point) after she was paid $12.5 million for the film \"Striptease.\" That's the same as around $25 million today. This record has been broken over and over in the years since. In 1997, she earned $11 million for \"G.I. Jane\".\n\nOther notable salaries include $3 million for \"A Few Good Men,\" $5 million for \"Indecent Proposal,\" $6 million for \"Disclosure,\" $7 million for \"The Scarlet Letter,\" and another $7 million for \"The Juror.\" During her peak years as an actress, Demi earned around $60 million in base salaries alone, worth the same as around $100 million today.\n\nBehind the scenes, she has earned millions as a film producer. She produced all three installments of the \"Austin Powers\" franchise.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 1990, Bruce and Demi paid $7 million for a 7,000-square-foot penthouse in Central Park's San Remo building in New York City. Soon after, they purchased a two-bedroom apartment in the same building. Demi received this apartment in their divorce. In 2015, she put it on the market for a mind-numbing $75 million. She sold the property in 2017 for $45 million.\n\nShe owns several properties in Hailey, Idaho, and a Beverly Hills mansion, which was acquired in 2003 for $3.15 million.\n\nEarly Life\n\nDemi Gene Guynes was born on November 11, 1962, in Roswell, New Mexico. She is professionally known as Demi Moore after adopting the last name of her first husband, Freddy Moore. Her biological father, Charles Harmon Sr., left her mother after only being married for two months, and her mother married Dan Guynes when Demi was three months old. Moore considers Guynes to be her father.\n\nThe family moved around often due to Guynes's frequent job changes, and they moved to West Hollywood, California, when Moore was 15 years old. She attended Fairfax High School, ultimately dropping out her junior year and moving out when she was 16. She then signed with the Elite Modeling Agency and began taking drama classes.\n\nCareer\n\nMoore's acting debut came with a brief role in the 1981 drama \"Choices,\" followed by the science fiction horror film \"Parasite\" in 1982. She then joined the cast of the ABC soap opera \"General Hospital\" until 1983, playing the role of an investigative reporter. In 1984, she appeared in two comedy films, \"Blame It on Rio\" and \"No Small Affair.\"\n\nHer big commercial breakthrough was her role in the drama \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1985), for which she is often associated with the group of actors known as the Brat Pack. She finished off the 1980s with the films \"About Last Night…\" (1986), \"One Crazy Summer\" (1986), \"Wisdom\" (1986), \"The Seventh Sign\" (1988), and \"We're No Angels\" (1989), also making her professional stage debut in an off-Broadway production of \"The Early Girl\" at the Circle Repertory Company in 1986.\n\nMoore reached a career-high point with 1990's \"Ghost,\" which grossed over $505 million and was the highest-grossing film that year. It is also one of her most successful films ever, earning her a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. She maintained her A-list status with the blockbuster hits \"A Few Good Men\" (1992), \"Indecent Proposal\" (1993), and \"Disclosure\" (1994), although she also starred in the less widely seen films \"Nothing but Trouble\" (1991) and \"The Butcher's Wife\" (1991).\n\nIn the late 1990s, Moore's box office began to wane. Despite becoming the highest-paid actress in film history for her $12.5 million salary to star in the 1996 film \"Striptease,\" many of her films from this period failed to impress. \"Striptease\" bombed at the domestic box office, and Moore received the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. Her films \"The Scarlet Letter\" (1995) and \"The Juror\" (1996) also received harsh criticism. Not all of her films from this period were failures, though; 1997's \"G.I. Jane\" was a moderate commercial success, and she also voiced Esmeralda in Disney's animated film \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1996). Additionally, she earned her second Golden Globe nomination for her starring role in a controversial HBO miniseries on abortion, \"If These Walls Could Talk\" (1996), which she also produced.\n\nMoore took a step back from acting and appeared in relatively few projects in the early 2000s as she focused on raising her daughters in Hailey, Idaho. These include the arthouse drama \"Passion of Mind\" (2000), \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\" (2003), \"Bobby\" (2006) and \"Flawless\" (2008).\n\nDemi returned to acting after 2010, taking on more regular and frequent projects. She starred in the films \"Happy Tears\" (2010), \"Bunraku\" (2010), \"Margin Call\" (2011), \"Another Happy Day\" (2011), \"Blind\" (2017), \"Rough Night\" (2017), \"Love Sonia\" (2018) and \"Corporate Animals\" (2019). Other films Moore made appearances in during this period include \"LOL\" (2012), \"Very Good Girls\" (2013), \"Forsaken\" (2015) and \"Wild Oats\" (2016). She also worked as the director of a segment of the 2011 Lifetime anthology film \"Five,\" for which she received a Directors Guild of America Award nomination for Outstanding Directing – Miniseries or TV Film. More recently, she has appeared in the series \"Empire\" (2017-2018) \"Brave New World\" (2020), and \"Dirty Diana\" (2020) and the films \"Rough Night\" (2017), \"Love Sonia\" (2018), \"Corporate Animals\" (2019), \"Songbird\" (2020), \"Please Baby Please\" (2022), and \"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\" (2022). In 2024, she portrayed Ann Woodward on the FX anthology series \"Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.\"\n\nOther Projects\n\nHarperCollins published Moore's memoir \"Inside Out\" in September 2019. It debuted at #1 on \"The New York Times\" Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction best-sellers list and Hardcover Nonfiction best-sellers list.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nDemi has been married three times. She married musician Freddy Moore in 1981 when she was only 18 years old. Moore was 12 years her senior. After they divorced in 1985, Demi became engaged to actor Emilio Estevez. They planned to marry in December 1986, but the engagement was ultimately called off.\n\nMoore then married actor Bruce Willis in 1987, and they have three children together, Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah Willis. Moore and Willis announced their separation in 1998 and filed for divorce in October 2000. Bruce eventually paid Demi a $90 million divorce settlement that included cash and real estate.\n\nIn 2003, Moore began dating actor Ashton Kutcher, who is 15 years her junior. They tied the knot in September 2005 before separating in 2011 and finalizing their divorce in November 2013.\n\nDemi is a high-profile doll collector, and among her favorites is a Gene Marshall fashion doll. At one point, she had a separate residence in which she kept all 2,000+ dolls.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nMoore has supported many charities, including the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, Healthy Child Healthy World, and UNICEF. In 2009, Moore and her then-husband Ashton Kutcher launched the DNA Foundation, a nonprofit NGO aiming to fight against child sexual slavery. In 2010, Moore was featured as a special contributor for the CNN Freedom Project, where she traveled to Nepal to meet CNN's 2010 Hero of the Year, Anuradha Koirala. Koirala founded the organization Maiti Nepal, which rescues children from sex trafficking. Demi also narrated the subsequent CNN documentary on child trafficking, \"Nepal's Stolen Children\" (2011). In 2018, Visionary Women, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit, honored Moore with its inaugural Visionary Woman Award for her work in combating human trafficking."
