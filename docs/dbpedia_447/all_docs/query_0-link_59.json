        "text": "Taylor Sheridan‘s next drama series Landman has cast Demi Moore in a starring role.\n\n,The Ghost and A Few Good Men actress will be a series regular along with previously announced star Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nMoore will play Cami, “wife to one of the most powerful oil men in Texas and a friend of Tommy Norris (Thornton).”\n\nShe joins the growing list of veteran film stars who had major hits in the 1980s and ’90s who have signed on to Sheridan shows (such as Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner, Helen Mirren, Sylvester Stallone and Nicole Kidman). Moore is currently also appearing in FX/Hulu anthology series Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.\n\nParamount+‘s official description for Landman reads: “Set in the proverbial boomtowns of West Texas, Landman is a modern-day tale of fortune-seeking in the world of oil rigs. Based on the notable 11-part podcast Boomtown, the series is an upstairs/downstairs story of roughnecks and wildcat billionaires fueling a boom so big, it’s reshaping our climate, our economy and our geopolitics.”\n\nThe drama is co-created by Oscar nominee Sheridan and Christian Wallace.\n\nThe series also stars Ali Larter (The Last Victim), Michelle Randolph (1923), Jacob Lofland (Joker 2), Kayla Wallace (When Calls the Heart), James Jordan (Yellowstone), Mark Collie (Nashville) and Paulina Chávez (The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia).\n\nFilming has begun in and around Fort Worth, Texas, and is produced by MTV Entertainment Studios, 101 Studios and Sheridan’s Bosque Ranch Productions."
