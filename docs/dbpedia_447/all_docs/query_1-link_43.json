        "text": "Even though Demi Moore and Demi Lovato both spell their names the same way, they pronounce them totally differently.\n\nWhile a guest on the Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon, Moore discusses how her and Lovato chose how to pronounce their name differently based on their last names. It turns out both the actress and singer have the same full name of Demetria. Lovato being from Texas and Moore from New Mexico, the two realized they are supposed to pronounce their names the same. However, due to the way their last names are spelt it makes more sense for Demi Moore to pronounce her name differently."
