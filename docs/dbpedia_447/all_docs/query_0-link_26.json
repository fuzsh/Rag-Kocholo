        "text": "Demi Moore's childhood was somewhat turbulent, involving a lot of travel and upheaval. She never really settled down until moving near Hollywood as a teenager in the late 1970s, where she started to focus on modeling and acting. At age 18, she married musician Freddy Moore, though their marriage lasted only four years. In that time, Moore made her acting debut in \"Choices\" (1981) and appeared regularly on \"General Hospital\" (ABC 1963- ) in 1982 and 1983. After a critically received turn in the comedy \"Blame It on Rio\" (1984) and a commercially successful appearance in \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1985), Moore's star started to shine brighter. \"About Last Night...\" (1986) was the highlight of her late '80s string of movies, eventually culminating in her adored performance in \"Ghost\" (1990) alongside Patrick Swayze. She married actor Bruce Willis in 1987, starting a relationship that would last more than a decade. The pair had three children, including actress Rumer Willis. The early '90s featured more notable performances from Moore, primarily \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and \"Indecent Proposal\" (1993). By the mid-'90s, she was one of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood, earning a then-record salary for her performance in \"Striptease\" (1996), which while successful, was critically maligned. After the fervor of being the highest-paid actress of her time, Moore moved to Idaho to focus on raising her three children following her split with Willis. Her next major commercial role was in \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\" (2003), and around that time she started dating actor Ashton Kutcher. The pair married in 2005 and eventually divorced in 2012. Throughout the 2000s, Moore still acted, but never to the mainstream level she did in the '90s. She appeared in the Emilio Estevez-directed ensemble movie \"Bobby\" (2006) as well as appearing in thriller \"Mr Brooks\" (2007) and \"The Joneses\" (2010). Aside from a few episodes on \"Empire\" (Fox 2015- ), Moore has kept a low acting profile. She focuses most of her time on charities and philanthropy, primarily related to raising awareness of sexual trafficking throughout the world. She released her autobiography in 2019."
