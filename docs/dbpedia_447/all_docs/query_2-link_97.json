        "text": "Demi Moore not only has her movie “The Substance” playing in competition at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, but she’s also signed on to host amfAR’s annual gala.\n\nThe evening will mark Moore’s first return to the HIV/AIDS fundraiser in 27 years.\n\n“We are excited and grateful to have Demi Moore back with amfAR in Cannes,” the organization’s CEO Kevin Robert Frost said in a statement Monday. “She joined us at the gala in 1997, helping to raise critical funds for AIDS research, and she has been a loyal supporter ever since.”\n\nAs Variety exclusively reported last month, the gala’s lineup includes a performance by Cher. “I have such wonderful memories of being invited to host one of the first amfAR events in Cannes by my friend Elizabeth Taylor,” the music superstar said. “I am extremely proud to be returning for this event’s 30th anniversary, and to continue to support the incredible work of this organization. It will be a very special evening.”\n\nThe black-tie event will take place at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc and feature a live auction of one-of-a-kind luxury goods, experiences and art led by renowned auctioneer Simon de Pury. Longtime amfAR supporter Carine Roitfeld will once again curate a fashion show.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThis year’s presenting sponsors include Chopard and the Red Sea International Film Festival, and the evening’s signature sponsors are Homolog and DraftKings. The event is supported by Gérard Bertrand, Piper-Heidsieck and Rumor Rosé.\n\nSince amfAR’s late founding international chairman Elizabeth Taylor hosted the first amfAR Gala Cannes in 1993 at the Moulin de Mougins, the benefit has become one of the most coveted tickets of the festival and has raised $264 million for amfAR’s lifesaving HIV/AIDS research programs."
