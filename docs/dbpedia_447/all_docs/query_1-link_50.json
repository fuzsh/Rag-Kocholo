        "text": "Demi Moore's return to the Met Gala was unforgettable.\n\nThe actress walked the 2024 Met Gala steps in an unexpected structural gown by Harris Reed, marking the first time she has attended the event in five years.\n\nMoore, 61, turned heads on Monday wearing a diamond Cartier necklace and matching earrings. Her floor-length black column gown was made from archival vintage wallpaper.\n\nStaying on the \"Garden of Time\" dress code, her getup featured a pink-and-white floral design and a protruding heart-shaped structural element with spiked arrows.\n\nHer sleek black hair and soft makeup allowed for her dramatic outfit to take center stage.\n\nDespite its commanding presence, Moore said her elegant dress was \"not heavy at all.\"\n\nThe inspiration for the dress started with Moore's Cartier accessories.\n\n\"It all started with this incredible Cartier necklace that Demi is wearing,\" Reed told Ashley Graham on the Vogue red carpet. \"It was inspired by the floral feeling it gave me. The whole piece is made of vintage archival wallpaper. We repurposed it. It's 11,000 hours of silk embroidery that we've repurposed into this idea of her blooming on the carpet. I wanted to be the vines to her thorns.\"\n\nMoore last attended the Met Gala in 2019 in all-black gown with a plunging neckline by Saint Laurent.\n\nEntertainment Tonight will be on the iconic Met Gala red carpet, so keep checking back with ETonline for more coverage from fashion's biggest night, including live updates and all of the jaw-dropping red carpet looks."
