        "text": "Demi Moore was ahead of the Hollywood pregnancy fad when she started having babies at the young age of 26 with her then-husband Bruce Willis. Apparently, she was also a trend-setter when it came to picking out unusual names for her daughters. The first was Rumer Glenn (b. 1988) named after British novelist Rumer Godden. In 1991, Moore had her second daughter Scout LaRue whose name came from one of the most beloved characters in American fiction, Scout Finch from “To Kill a Mockingbird” and lastly there was Tallulah Belle whose name was inspired by Tallulah Bankhead, a husky-voiced actress from the Golden Era of Hollywood. Tallulah Willis later changed her name to Lula having been dissatisfied with her parentâ€™s original choice. Wonder if we’ll see more celebrity children follow suit!"
