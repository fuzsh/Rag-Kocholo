        "text": "It takes a village... or some interior design inspiration!\n\nDemi Moore climbed the famous steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the first time in five years on Monday, turning heads in an eye-catching Harris Reed design.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nHer black structural gown featured a pink and white floral design, with spiked, heart-shaped protruding from its centre. If the dress' design looks wallpaper-esque, that's because it is!\n\nThe gown's designer Harris told red carpet reporter Ashley Graham: 'It all started with this incredible Cartier necklace that Demi is wearing. It was inspired by the floral feeling it gave me.'\n\n'The whole piece is made out of vintage archival wallpaper. We repurposed it,' he continued. 'It’s 11,000 hours of silk embroidery that we’ve repurposed into this idea of her blooming on the carpet. I wanted to be the vines to her thorns.'\n\nThe thorns are evidently a nod to the 2024 Met Gala theme, 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion', playing on protagonist Aurora's name Briar Rose.\n\nDemi added that the flower on her statement gown is chloris, 'which is [named after the] Greek... nymph of plants and flowers.'\n\nDemi wasn't the only star that pulled out all the stops for this year's Met Gala theme, others celebrities that embraced their spring/summer florals included Gigi Hadid, Zendaya and Lana Del Rey."
