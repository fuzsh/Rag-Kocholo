        "text": "Along with Mindy Kaling — who walked the Metropolitan Museum steps in flowy Guarav Gupta — actress and fashion star of the moment Demi Moore wore one of the most sculptural gowns of Met Gala 2024.\n\nOn a night when a number of stars played it safe — see Donald Glover in a brown suit — Moore went all out in a custom dress by British-American designer Harris Reed Vogue livestream co-host Ashley Graham called one of “the biggest outfits I’ve seen all night.”\n\nThe outspread black dress features large pink-and-white flower imagery and black arrow-like spikes. Moore assured Graham, however, that it wasn’t heavy. “Actually, it’s not heavy at all,” said the actress, cheekily adding, “Feel my hips. They’re soft. It makes you want to rub them.” See all the red carpet arrivals here.\n\nReed shared that the dress was inspired by the stunning Cartier necklace that Moore paired with the look. “It’s a brand-new piece by Cartier,” said Moore of the piece, which Cartier calls the Nature Sauvage Chloris necklace, crafted in platinum, emeralds and diamonds.\n\nInspired by the “floral feeling” of the necklace, Harris explained that he created the dress out of vintage archival wallpaper. “We repurposed it. It’s all 11,000 hours of silk embroidery and then we repurposed it into this Victorian idea of basically her blooming on the carpet and covered in these thorns … this gorgeous flower in the perfect moment of bloom.”\n\nMoore’s stylist, Brad Goreski, added in a post on Instagram that the wallpaper used for the dress is from a “60-year-old panel” and that “the chiffon petals at the bottom of the gown are hand painted.”\n\nThe designer called the 2024 Met Gala evening “one of my favorite moments of my entire life,” adding that he’s proud to be a risk taker in fashion. “Fashion needs to be about risk taking, having fun and just like celebrating beauty and creativity. And I think when I was like, ‘We’re using wallpaper. We’re doing spikes. You’re gonna be a thorn.’ She was all about it.”\n\nMoore concurred she was totally on board: “I said, ‘Yes, let’s do it.”\n\nFor Moore’s Met Gala glam look, makeup artist Kristofer Buckle used a selection of product by Charlotte Tilbury Beauty including K.I.S.S.I.N.G. lipstick in Candy Chic, Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes! Mascara, and Tilbury’s Beautiful Skin Foundation.\n\nThe actress next stars in The Substance, opposite Margaret Qualley and Dennis Quaid, which will premiere later this month at the Cannes Film Festival. On the Met Gala red carpet, Moore described the film as “about aging — it is in the category of phantasmagoric.”"
