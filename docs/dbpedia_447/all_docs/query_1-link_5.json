        "text": "All eyes are on Demi Moore amid her Hollywood comeback, and her fashion icon era. With this newfound attention, everyone wants to know what’s going on in her personal life, and if there’s a new A-list romance on the horizon.\n\nSources say that A-listers like John Travolta and Tom Cruise have had their eye on Moore, and just yesterday, Moore was seen out at lunch with the newly single Joe Jonas. But sources claim she doesn’t have an A-list romance on the brain. Instead of a Joe Jonas, she allegedly wants a regular Joe.\n\nSources told InTouch Weekly, “Demi gets so many offers from other Hollywood stars from literally every age bracket, and she’s very flattered by it, but she’s totally closed off to dating someone else in the industry.”\n\n“She wants to find love and settle down eventually, but she wants it to be with someone outside of the business because, in her view, there’s just not room in a relationship for two stars,” the source said, adding that she’s also not in a rush to date again either. “She’s also not in a rush [to start dating], she loves her own company and is really enjoying the single life.”\n\nAfter her marriage to Bruce Willis, and later Ashton Kutcher, she dated Dead Sara drummer Sean Friday in 2013, and in 2022, she was dating chef Daniel Humm for less than a year, per US Weekly.\n\nMany loved Moore’s romance with Humm, but sources say she learned a lot about what she wants in a beau from that.\n\n“Her last relationship with Daniel was good while it lasted, but it made her realize she’d rather be single than with the wrong person,” they added to the outlet. “So now she’s taking her time and being very selective about who she’ll even go on a date with. She’s confident that she’ll know it when the right person comes along, and says it will happen when she’s not looking – like it always does.”"
