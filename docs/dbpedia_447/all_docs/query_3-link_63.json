        "text": "Demi Moore is joining the cast of the Paramount+ drama Landman from Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace.\n\nMoore will play the series regular role of Cami, wife to one of the most powerful oil men in Texas and a friend of Tommy Norris (Billy Bob Thornton).\n\nSet in the proverbial boomtowns of West Texas, Landman is a modern-day tale of fortune seeking in the world of oil rigs. Based on the 11-part podcast “Boomtown,” the series is an upstairs/downstairs story of roughnecks and wildcat billionaires fueling a boom so big, it’s reshaping our climate, our economy and our geopolitics.\n\n“Demi Moore is an iconic and extraordinary talent,” said Chris McCarthy, President and CEO, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios. “We are thrilled to have her join Billy Bob Thornton and the star-studded cast of Landman, our next epic series from Taylor Sheridan.”\n\nMoore can be seen in the second season of Ryan Murphy’s anthology series Feud: Capote vs. The Swans as socialite Ann Woodward, a former showgirl and radio actress who was infamously accused of murdering her husband in 1955. She’s also starring in Coralie Fargeat’s first studio feature, The Substance, alongside Margaret Qualley.\n\nMoore is repped by CAA, Untitled Entertainment, and Gang, Tyre, Ramer, Brown & Passman.\n\nIn addition to Thornton and Moore, Landman stars Ali Larter (The Last Victim), Michelle Randolph (1923), Jacob Lofland (Joker 2), Kayla Wallace (When Calls the Heart), James Jordan (Yellowstone), Mark Collie (Nashville) and Paulina Chávez (The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia).\n\nCurrently filming in and around Fort Worth, Texas, Landman is executive produced by Sheridan, Wallace, David C. Glasser, ​David Hutkin, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari​, Geyer Kosinski, Michael Friedman and Stephen Kay. Dan Friedkin and Jason Hoch, for Imperative Development LLC, and J.K. Nickell and Megan Creydt, for Texas Monthly, also executive produce. Peter Feldman serves as co-executive producer."
