        "text": "And Moore's three daughters — Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30 — are here for all the praise.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Today\" Wednesday, Rumer revealed the text thread she and her sisters have with their mother, which is going berzerk right now — not just over the hype for their mom but also over the looks she gave on the red carpet while in the South of France.\n\n\"We have a thread that we call 'Lineage of Females' that has all my sisters and I on it, and we don't see the looks she's going to do, so when we do, we're like, 'Oh my god, mom, mom, mom, this is amazing, you look iconic! We're losing our minds.'\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWhen host Jenna Bush Hager asked Rumer if they were using the term \"Demissance\" to refer to their mom's current comeback, Rumer said they were.\n\n\"We're hijacking it from Matthew McConaughey,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nMoore, 61, who had her daughters while married to Bruce Willis before they divorced, found fame in the 1980s. She was part of The Brat Pack, the label used in a 1985 New York Magazine profile for the actors who starred in \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" She continued to receive critical acclaim in the 1990s, thanks to hits like \"Ghost\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"\n\nIn \"The Substance,\" Moore plays a former movie star from the 1980s who now hosts a fitness show. Her character's producer wants to fire her because she's over 50. Then she learns of a process called The Substance that will create \"a new you,\" but she learns there's a horrific catch.\n\nThe movie will be out in the fall."
