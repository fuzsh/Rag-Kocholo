        "text": "Demi Moore made her debut in the Cannes Film Festival’s official selection Sunday evening with the competition title The Substance. The much-anticipated blood-splattered horror thriller from French director Coralie Fargeat was met with 13-minute ovation, the longest for a title so far at this year’s festival.\n\nThe applause was consistent from the minute the credits hit the screen on the pic, which also stars Margaret Qualley and Dennis Quaid. It is billed as a body horror with a feminist take, revolving around a new product called The Substance that promises to transform people in the best version of themselves of their dreams. It’s an offer that comes with a twist.\n\nAlthough The Substance premiere screening started late by 20 minutes, there was thunderous applause for the movie by the time it wrapped around 1 a.m., with rhythmic clapping for this big comeback movie from Moore.\n\nMoore, Qualley and Fargeat all seemed giddy about the response, with Moore throwing a kiss to the screen saying “Thank you! Thank you!”\n\nForgeat said, “Merci Master Thierry” referring to Cannes boss Thierry Fremaux, while Moore noted it was her first film to play Cannes. “It has been an incredible ride,” she said in brief remarks.\n\nRELATED: Cannes Film Festival 2024: All Of Deadline’s Movie Reviews\n\nPer the official synopsis for The Substance: “It generates another you. A new, younger, more beautiful, more perfect you. And there’s only one rule: You share time. One week for you. One week for the new you. Seven days each. A perfect balance. Easy. Right? If you respect the balance… what could possibly go wrong?\n\nMubi acquired global rights to the movie ahead of the festival; it was big night for the company as it ramps up its own internal theatrical distribution arm under new distribution boss Mark Boxer.\n\nMoore, accompanied by her cute pooch Pilaf, earlier today talked about navigating Hollywood as an older actress, “You just show up and you face what’s in front of you to the best of your ability. I think what’s most important is how you hold yourself not how the world is holding you… which is exactly what The Substance is about – this male perspective of the idealized woman, that we as women have bought into… and I think we are changing. We are living the change right now.”\n\nAs well as her red carpet appearance with The Substance, Moore is busy this week as godmother for Chopard’s Trophée Chopard gala ceremony and host of amfAR’s 30th anniversary Cannes gala on Thursday."
