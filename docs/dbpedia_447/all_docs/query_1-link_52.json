        "text": "Actress Demi Moore recently shared an update on Bruce Willis’ health on Good Morning America.\n\nThe former actor was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 following an aphasia diagnosis in 2022.\n\nFrontotemporal dementia affects people in their 50s and 60s and impacts executive functioning capabilities like language and motor skills.\n\nNearly one year after actor Bruce Willis was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, his ex-wife, actress Demi Moore, shared an update on his health.\n\nWillis, 68, was previously diagnosed with aphasia — a disorder that affects people’s ability to communicate — in 2022. The “Die Hard” and “Pulp Fiction” star retired from acting following his aphasia diagnosis.\n\n“I think given the givens, he’s doing very well,” Moore said during an interview with “Good Morning America,” on Wednesday.\n\nDuring another recent interview on Sirius XM, Moore, the star of the new Hulu drama “Feud,” shared some advice for loved ones caring for a family member with dementia.\n\n“When you let go of who they’ve been, or who you think they (are), or who even you would like them to be, you can then really stay in the present and take in the joy and the love that is present and there for all that they are, not all that they’re not,” she told radio host Andy Cohen.\n\nFrontotemporal dementia affects around 60,000 Americans — the majority of whom are in their 50s and 60s.\n\nMoore has been raising awareness of frontotemporal dementia since announcing Willis’ diagnosis on Instagram in February 2023. The family’s official statement was also shared on the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration’s website in February 2023.\n\n“Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately. We know in our hearts that — if he could today — he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families,” the family wrote.\n\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a type of dementia that impacts executive functioning capabilities.\n\nFTD involves the degeneration of several parts of the brain, but has the greatest impact on the frontal and temporal lobes, which are responsible for executive functioning tasks like decision-making, language, and social skills.\n\n“FTD is unique in it causes loss of function in two of the four lobes of the brain, in the frontal and temporal lobes sparing the parietal lobes and cerebellum,” said Dr. Clifford Segil, neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.\n\nSimilar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), advanced FTD may lead to memory loss. FTD also affects personality, ability to communicate, and motor skills.\n\nWhen language impairment occurs, it is called primary progressive aphasia (PPA).\n\nDr. S. Ahmad Sajjadi, associate professor of neurology and pathology at University of California, Irvine, told Healthline that early warning signs of frontotemporal dementia may include:\n\nmild behavioral issues\n\napathy or lack of empathy\n\nissues comprehending words\n\nSajjadi added that symptoms of advanced frontotemporal dementia may include:\n\nsevere obsession\n\nagitation\n\ndisinhibited behavior\n\n“In PPA patients can become mute or lose their ability to comprehend even single language structures,” Sajjadi said in an earlier interview.\n\nFTD is often misdiagnosed as a movement disorder like Parkinson’s disease (PD) or a psychiatric issue.\n\nTo diagnose FTD, a neurologist will examine the symptoms and perform brain scans — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans — to see if and how the brain structure is affected."
