        "text": "Demi Moore took glam to a whole new level with this year’s Met Gala look.\n\nThe actress, 61, rocked Monday’s carpet in an otherworldly Harris Reed custom gown paired with a never-before-seen Cartier piece.\n\nMoore’s black gown – made of vintage, archived wallpaper – featured beautiful pink-and-white flowers on the front, with winged sleeves, arrow embellishments and ruffles.\n\nMoore completely nailed this year’s theme, ”Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” which highlights delicate pieces that are too fragile to ever be worn again.\n\nPer her style team, the entire look was inspired by the new Cartier necklace that the actress debuted on the carpet – a reflection of a Victorian flower in bloom.\n\nAccording to Vogue, Moore’s Cartier accessory is a Cloris flower pendant necklace and earrings combo. The necklace features 7.87 carats of emeralds and platinum and diamond-encrusted spirals with emerald centers. The earrings are a matching emerald and diamond set of 2.25 carats.\n\n“It’s like a dandelion that’s blowing in the wind,” Moore said of the jewelry pieces on the carpet. “This dress for me, was like the petals falling off [the flower].”\n\nShe wore Rapunzel-length hair extensions that came down to her knees, showing off a glowing Charlotte Tilbury beauty look including the brand’s new K.I.S.S.I.N.G. Lipstick ($35).\n\nThe high profile Met Gala appearance marked Moore’s return to the charity event after missing it for the past three years.\n\nIn 2019, Moore made her first appearance at the Met Gala in eight years while wearing a plunging black tuxedo gown by Saint Laurent.\n\nHer last appearance was nine years prior, where she sported an elegant black feather dress to 2011’s “Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty” event.\n\nAnd while she hadn’t walked the Met steps recently, the “Ghost” star rocked a bold brown gown with cutouts at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscars Party in March.\n\nLet’s hope it’s not another three years before we get “Moore” of this gorgeous star on the first Monday of May."
