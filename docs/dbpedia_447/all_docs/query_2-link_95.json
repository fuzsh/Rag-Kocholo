        "text": "Right, seemingly, anyway. Despite all her accomplishments, which might provoke spiteful envy if they weren’t worn so modestly, Moore is not totally comfortable being the focus of a lengthy interview. She says she is amazed just to be “talking about doing things with really amazing directors –– a few years ago that was my goal, and I feel like I’ve really worked for it, and it’s beginning to happen.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nSo, what will she do when she runs out of goals?\n\n“You never run out of goals, never,” says Moore. “Not unless you want to stop really living. There are people who are happy to stay within parameters, but for me, that would never have been enough.”\n\nLet’s start with “Disclosure.” I thought you were perfection as a scary bitch, but I’m not sure it wasn’t a kind of icky movie.\n\nReally? What was icky? What constitutes icky?\n\nWell, I was expecting it to be ickier, by which I mean more misogynist because the book really was, I thought.\n\nI thought it was actually very pro female.\n\nRelated\n\nReally? In the book, what I disliked was how thorough the misogyny was. The wife doesn’t come across well, though in the movie that’s more balanced.\n\nAbout the wife, I totally agree with you.\n\nOtherwise it’s a guy with a whiny woman on one side . . .\n\nAnd a bitch on wheels on the other. But what’s interesting –– and I totally credit [director] Barry Levinson with this –– is that he felt it was extremely important that the wife’s presence be felt throughout. And I think the wife is the woman that more women identify with. She’s a working mother, she’s juggling to balance her family and career, that whole dynamic.\n\nBut even in the movie, that means the good girl, who’s married, a mom, blond and monogamous, is… . . . well, the good girl. Whereas the hot brunette, who’s sexual and single and ambitious, is really horrible.\n\nYes, I see your point. But the fact is that she is a sexually aggressive woman who doesn’t apologize for it, and there’s nothing wrong with that part of her –– that’s not the negative. I don’t even think her ambition is the negative, and I think she’s good at what she does, which is also different in the book. But she’s dishonest, she’s manipulative, and she’s willing to dispense with people if they don’t serve her, and those are the negatives. In the end, the way Barry structured it, there is no gender discretion when it comes to business. So when I say in the end, “I played the game the way you guys set it up, and I’m being fired,” it’s the truth.\n\nRight. But that’s saying she played a man’s game.\n\nIn business it is the game. It’s only a man’s game in the sense that they’ve been doing it longer. And that to me is the more interesting power of the whole piece.\n\nSo you’re not worried that the portrayal demonizes women?\n\nNo, because I think it’s very human. But what do you mean “demonize”? You mean, is she like a devil woman?\n\nYes, because, say, in “Fatal Attraction” I think you do feel for Glenn Close as a woman who’s crazy but crazy because a man won’t take responsibility for what he’s done.\n\nBut for me she really had less connection with the real world. I think Meredith is just an opportunist in a way that’s gender neutral.\n\nSo she’s a role model?\n\nNo, no. She’s a role model for what women shouldn’t be.\n\nAnd who do you remember in the way of female role models when you were growing up?\n\nKatharine Hepburn I’ve said before. And now I look at Susan Sarandon, who’s also made tremendous strides for women. She’s really crossed some barriers, particularly with the strength and the power of her image now that she gets older, staying as a sexual being and really showing that it does not go away because you’re over 40 or because you’re a mother. It’s as much in her as it’s always been. And I think she’s laid groundwork for those of us who are coming up to it. And there was that moment in my life when I thought that the Bionic Woman was about the coolest thing going."
