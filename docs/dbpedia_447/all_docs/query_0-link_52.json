        "text": "Was one of three finalists for the lead in Flashdance (1983). No one could decide between the three, so a group of about 50 men were brought into a room, shown the three audition tapes and asked who they would want to sleep with the most. Jennifer Beals won by a landslide.\n\nMoved out the day after her 16th birthday to live with Tom Dunston, a small-time musician 12 years her senior. His mother worked for 20th Century Fox and got Demi a receptionist job there. Demi dumped Tom in August 1979 after meeting Freddy Moore, her future husband, at the Troubadour nightclub in L.A.\n\nNegotiated her $3 million asking price down to $2 million for Eine Frage der Ehre (1992) because she was competing with Jodie Foster and Linda Hamilton for the role, and also because she badly needed another hit after the triple box office failure of Der Mann Ihrer Träume (1991), Tödliche Gedanken (1991) and Valkenvania - Die wunderbare Welt des Wahnsinns (1991).\n\nOwns a number of properties in and around Hailey, Idaho as well as a canyonside estate above Beverly Hills and a triplex penthouse at Manhattan's San Remo high-rise on Central Park West. She and Bruce had a beachfront mansion in Malibu but sold the place when they split up.\n\nDemi's real father, Charles Harmon left the family before she was born, which is why she didn't share his last name on her birth certificate. In her 2019 memoir, she wrote that she met him for the first time when she was thirteen years old, and he told her that he was devastated when Demi's mother divorced him so she could marry her true love Danny Guynes. Charlie then introduced her to her half-siblings from his two other marriages, one of whom looked like a male version of Demi. She cut off all ties with him and her half-siblings, because she always thought of Danny Guynes as her father."
