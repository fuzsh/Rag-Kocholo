        "text": "(born 1962). Unlike many young stars of the 1980s who quickly faded from the Hollywood limelight, American actress Demi Moore remained a powerful screen presence as she matured. In the late 1990s she was one of Hollywood’s leading ladies and highest-paid performers.\n\nShe was born Demetria Guynes on November 11, 1962, in Roswell, New Mexico, but her family moved some 30 times during her youth. Her distinctive husky voice led to phone work for a collection agency after she dropped out of high school at age 16. In the early 1980s she modeled, acted in some low-budget films, and had a brief marriage to musician Freddy Moore.\n\nMoore’s career took off in 1982 when she was cast in the popular television soap opera General Hospital. After the 1984 films Blame It on Rio and No Small Affair, she became known as a member of Hollywood’s “Brat Pack” of young stars, several of whom also appeared with her in the movie St. Elmo’s Fire (1985). During its filming, she joined a rehabilitation program to stop her dependence on drugs and alcohol.\n\nAfter roles in One Crazy Summer (1986), About Last Night … (1986), We’re No Angels (1989), and other films considered mediocre by most critics, Moore joined Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg in the Academy Award-nominated blockbuster Ghost (1990). She continued to land major roles throughout the decade, appearing in The Butcher’s Wife (1991), A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994), The Scarlet Letter (1995), Now and Then (1995), and The Juror (1996). She also provided the voice of Esmeralda for the Disney animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). By commanding $12.5 million for Striptease (1996), she became one of Hollywood’s highest-paid performers. Her film company, Moving Pictures, helped produce G.I. Jane (1997), a movie for which she shaved her head to play a Navy SEAL commando. Later films included Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle (2003), Bobby (2006), Mr. Brooks (2007), and Margin Call (2011). In 2011 Moore won praise as the director of one of the segments in the movie Five, which tackles the issue of breast cancer and the effect the disease has on family and friends."
