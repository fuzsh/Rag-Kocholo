        "text": "Hello and welcome to Gossip Time, a weekly guide to the stars by Allie Jones. This week: an actress and a pop star bond, a designer and a former hockey player catch a five-hour flight, and Hilary Duff stands up to technology.\n\nUsually, the gossip out of Cannes is that Leonardo DiCaprio has a new teenage girlfriend. But DiCaprio, 49, didn’t even go to the film festival this year, and he is by all accounts still dating the same model he met there last year: Vitorria Ceretti, who just turned 26 (wow!). Instead, the festival has brought us a new, unexpected May-December romance to consider. What if Demi Moore dated Joe Jonas?\n\nRight away, I love this idea, and it seems like their agents do too. “Insiders” revealed to Page Six this week that Moore, 61, and Jonas, 34, have struck up a “flirty new friendship” after spending time together at Cannes. Moore was there to premiere her new horror film, The Substance, which is actually getting good reviews. Jonas was there to perform at the annual amFAR gala, which Moore hosted. According to Page Six, the potential couple bonded during the festival and had lunch together at the Hotel du Cap Eden Roc.\n\n“Demi and Joe have struck up a friendship. They have mutual friends and they bonded,” a source revealed.\n\nAnother source told Us Weekly, meanwhile, that “Joe and Demi are just friends. There’s nothing romantic going on between them.” That’s exactly what you would say if you want people to speculate that something romantic is going on.\n\nCould this actually happen? Moore is kind of famous for dating younger men, but her age gap with ex-husband Ashton Kutcher was only 15 years. A 27-year age gap is a bit more of a stretch. And Jonas does not have a history of dating older women. He Instagram DM’d his estranged wife Sophie Turner when she was only 20 years old and started dating her shortly thereafter. It would be more believable if Jonas’s younger brother Nick Jonas was going for Moore — remember when he dated Kate Hudson when he was 23 and she was 37? But alas, he is married to Priyanka Chopra (who is 10 years his senior).\n\nStill, both are single: Moore broke up with her last boyfriend, restaurateur Daniel Humm, in 2022, and Jonas recently ended whatever he had going on with model Stormi Bree. And both could use some positive PR right now — Moore is trying to have a “Demi-sance,” per Page Six, and Jonas is attempting to rebound from how atrociously he handled his divorce from Turner. They are going to need to do a few more pap strolls stateside if they want to really sell this, though.\n\nAlso “just friends,” according to Us Weekly: Mary-Kate Olsen and her (bad) boyfriend Sean Avery. Two weeks ago, the designer and the former-hockey-player-turned-occasional-actor-and-podcast-host were photographed hanging out in Amagansett with their mutual friend Andy Cohen. The tabloids rushed to explain that Olsen, 37, and Avery, 44, who dated back in the mid-2000s when Olsen was at NYU and Avery was a Ranger, were not actually back together.\n\n“Mary-Kate and Sean have been friends since 2006, they had a fling for a while in 2007 and have remained friends,” a source told Us Weekly. “They see each other every summer in The Hamptons, but they’re just friends.”\n\n“Mary Kate and Sean have known one another for years,” another source told People. “They have been in the same social circles in NYC and share many mutual friends. They spend their summers in the Hamptons, and hang out with the same crowds.”\n\nSee guys? They’re just Hamptons friends. But then Olsen and Avery were spotted all the way over in Los Angeles together a week later.\n\nDeuxmoi got exclusive photos of the two having dinner with friends at E. Baldi in Beverly Hills. The photographer even caught Avery waving two dollars at the valet:\n\nI don’t know, these people look like they are dating to me. And Olsen remains committed to really big hats.\n\nSTUFF BY HILARY DUFF: Attention: Meta: Re: Instagram: Re: AI: Here is an important message from Hilary Duff:\n\nFinally, I must leave you with the news that Darren Criss and his wife Mia Swier have welcomed their second child together. His name is…Brother László Criss:\n\nIn Criss’s announcement post on Instagram, he clarified that yes, “his first name is Brother.” Criss and Swier also have a two-year-old daughter named Bluesy Belle Criss. Do you think these people have ever seen the movie Blues Brothers?"
