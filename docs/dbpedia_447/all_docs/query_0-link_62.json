However, Footwear News may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nDemi Moore attended the Dior Men spring 2025 show today held during Paris Fashion Week. The thespian was accompanied by her daughter, Scout LaRue Willis, and her tiny chihuahua, Pilaf.\n\nIn a breezy and sophisticated move, Moore sported a pair of stark white Dior Bay platform sandals in the fashion house’s gladiator style. The star’s designer footwear featured a leather cage-like construction with thick straps situated to a central piece on the visage of the shoes. Additionally, the sandal style included adjustable buckle closures, thick non-slip textural platform soles and open toes.\n\nMoore’s style is a bold one, marrying a classic gladiator sandal silhouette with that of a platform boot, creating a futuristic offering that immediately draws the eye. Retailing for $1,350 via Dior’s website, the Bay platform sandal also comes in a versatile jet-black colorway. Dior has a variety of sandal styles under their belt, including espadrilles, heels and low-top platform styles. The French brand’s sandal offerings vary from neutrals to bright neon hues.\n\nRelated\n\nAccompanying her sandal style, the “Ghost” actress wore a pseudo-suiting number comprising a fitted blazer fixed with a dog motif on the lapel and a matching mini skirt. Layered beneath her blazer, Moore wore a light gray collared shirt in a hoodie-esque style featuring drawstrings fixed to the collar.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nWhere shoes are concerned, Moore often opts for sleek and versatile pairs on the red carpet. The MTV Movie Award-winning actress‘ go-to styles are pointed and peep-toe pumps and strappy sandals, often hailing from brands like Christian Louboutin, Brian Atwood and Jimmy Choo.\n\nWhen off-duty, Moore can be seen in Nike, New Balance and Converse sneakers. The actress has recently become a larger fashion fixture, appearing on runways and in front rows for Dior, Fendi and Versace. She’s also appeared in campaigns for Andie Swim, Ann Taylor and more brands over the years.\n\nShop a Similar Style"
