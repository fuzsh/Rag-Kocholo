        "text": "Mrs. Kutcher, as she is known to her more than 3.8 million followers on Twitter, is taking over from fellow Hollywood actress Katie Holmes, starring in the US label's fall/winter campaign.\n\nThe ads, shot by Patrick Demarchelier at New York's Rockefeller Center Gardens, were released August 2. This means yet another lucrative fashion gig for the Moore-Kutcher clan: Demi's daughter Rumer Willis is currently modeling for the American brand Badgley Mischka, while Ashton co-stars with Alessandra Ambrosio in Brazilian label Colcci's ads.\n\nMeanwhile, another A-list actress, Julianne Moore, is reappearing in Talbots's ads: after previously fronting a campaign for the US retailer last spring, she can now be seen modeling sharp fall tailoring in the newly released pictures."
