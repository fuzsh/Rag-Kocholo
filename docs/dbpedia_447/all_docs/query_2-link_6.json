        "text": "Demi Moore made a bold entrance at the Cannes Film Festival premiere of her new film, “The Substance,” on Sunday.\n\nThe actress sported a sculptural Schiaparelli gown from the label’s spring 2024 couture collection, which featured a mermaid silhouette and a three-dimensional bodice. Moore added on Chopard diamonds, including a statement collar necklace and dangle earrings.\n\nStylist Brad Goreski, whose other A-list clients include Kaley Cuoco and Rashida Jones, dressed Moore for the occasion.\n\nHairdresser Hos Hounkpatin styled Moore’s dark tresses straightened, while makeup artist Alex Babsky gave her winged eyeliner and coral blush.\n\nOn Monday, Moore channeled the black and white trend in a plunging polka-dot dress by Elie Saab. She had her dog, Pilaf, in tow, accessorizing with sunglasses and patent leather Aquazzura pumps.\n\nAfter monochrome hues had a major moment on the runways of Gucci, Chloé and Carven during their spring 2024 presentations, shades of black and white have made their way to the red carpet. Pared-down palettes were popular among attendees during awards season, with stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Carey Mulligan and Keri Russell embracing the trend at the Golden Globes and the Oscars.\n\nThe 77th annual Cannes Film Festival occurs from May 14 to 25. “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig serves as the jury president for this year’s festival, held in the South of France. Several high-profile premieres, including Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis” and “Furiosa” starring Anya Taylor-Joy, are expected to take place, while Meryl Streep will receive an honorary Palme d’Or."
