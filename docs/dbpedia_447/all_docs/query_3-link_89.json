        "text": "Landman. Coming Exclusively To Paramount+.\n\nParamount+ today announced that Golden Globe® nominee Demi Moore will star in the highly anticipated original drama series Landman as a series regular. Moore will play Cami, wife to one of the most powerful oil men in Texas and a friend of Tommy Norris, played by Oscar® winner and series lead Billy Bob Thornton. Co-created by Oscar nominee Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace, Landman is produced by MTV Entertainment Studios, 101 Studios and Sheridan’s Bosque Ranch Productions exclusively for Paramount+.\n\nSet in the proverbial boomtowns of West Texas, Landman is a modern-day tale of fortune seeking in the world of oil rigs. Based on the notable 11-part podcast Boomtown, the series is an upstairs/downstairs story of roughnecks and wildcat billionaires fueling a boom so big, it’s reshaping our climate, our economy and our geopolitics.\n\nMoore has proven herself to be one of the industry’s most accomplished performers, lending her talents to an array of revered films and television both in front of and behind the camera. The actress set a record in 1995 when she became the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, a testament to her star power and box office appeal. Most recently, Moore can be seen in the second season of Ryan Murphy’s anthology series Feud: Capote vs. The Swans as socialite Ann Woodward, a former showgirl and radio actress who was infamously accused of murdering her husband in 1955.\n\nThe actress will soon be seen in Coralie Fargeat’s first studio feature, The Substance, alongside Margaret Qualley. Moore’s acting career took off in the late 1980’s when she starred in St. Elmo’s Fire. She then went on to star in such iconic films as About Last Night…, Ghost, A Few Good Men, Indecent Proposal, The Scarlet Letter, Disclosure and G.I. Jane. Success poured into the following years, with Moore consistently in well-grossing films including Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, Bobby and Margin Call among many others. She produced and lent her voice to QCode’s podcast Dirty Diana, which is being adapted into a series that Moore will star in. In 2019, she added New York Times Best Seller to her lengthy list of credits with her memoir Inside Out.\n\nIn addition to Thornton and Moore, the series stars Ali Larter (The Last Victim), Michelle Randolph (1923), Jacob Lofland (Joker 2), Kayla Wallace (When Calls the Heart), James Jordan (Yellowstone), Mark Collie (Nashville) and Paulina Chávez (The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia).\n\nCurrently filming in and around Fort Worth, Texas, Landman is executive produced by Taylor Sheridan, David C. Glasser, David Hutkin, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, Christian Wallace, Geyer Kosinski, Michael Friedman and Stephen Kay. Dan Friedkin and Jason Hoch, for Imperative Development LLC, and J.K. Nickell and Megan Creydt, for Texas Monthly, also executive produce. Peter Feldman serves as co-executive producer.\n\nThe series is the latest addition to Sheridan’s growing slate on Paramount+, which includes 1923, 1883, Special Ops: Lioness, Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King and Lawmen: Bass Reeves."
