        "text": "It's b*tch-fight time in Hollywood. Demi Moore has strayed from her longtime stylist, Rachel Zoe, in favor of Zoe's former assistant, Brad Goreski, causing huge drama.\n\nA source told us, \" Brad is dressing Demi for the Oscar parties, and he also dressed her at Sundance.\" Moore was a longtime client of Zoe and appeared on her Bravo show. But she seems to have taken her allegiance elsewhere after Goreski broke with Zoe and set up on his own last October. Our source said, \"Rachel is furious. Brad assisted her in styling Demi. Now she feels betrayed.\" Reps for Zoe and Moore didn't get back to us. Goreski said, \"No comment.\"\n\nnytimes & huffington post\n\nWell this is very interesting. That makes two clients that have gone off to her former assistants. Anne will never leave her but sometimes I think Cam and Kate could move away.\n\n^ Wow!! Sort of shocking I guess! I never saw Brad as that talented to be honest....But- Demi is not exactly at the top of the list these days; if Anne or Cam left her I would really be upset!! Maybe, as you said, the baby is a factor, but still it can't be the sort of sign you want to see in your business...\n\nyep all we saw Brad do was complain and text. talk about a work ethic.\n\nI wonder if this IS true, and Demi starts appearing on the \"worst\" dress lists, would she go back to Rachel? Didn't Rachel dress her in Versace last year or 2 years ago and and Demi was on the best list? I am sure it was on the show too"
