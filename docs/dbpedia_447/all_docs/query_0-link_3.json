        "text": "Demi Moore made a white-hot entrance at the AmfAR Cannes Gala on Thursday in Cap d’Antibes, France.\n\nThe actress, who has attended several events at the ongoing Cannes Film Festival this week, appeared alongside several starry guests including Cher, Kelly Rowland and Diane Kruger.\n\nMoore sported a plunging gown by Loewe featuring a cowl bodice, embellished straps and a thigh-high slit. The “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans” star added on Chopard diamond jewelry and completed the look with Aquazzura heels.\n\nStylist Brad Goreski, whose other A-list clients include Kaley Cuoco and Rashida Jones, dressed Moore for the occasion.\n\nMoore’s dark tresses were styled in an updo, while the actress’s makeup consisted of a shimmery eye shadow and a pink lip.\n\nOn Monday, Moore made a three-dimensional statement at the premiere of her latest project, “The Substance,” wearing a sculptural Schiaparelli look on the red carpet. Her corseted satin frock came from the label’s spring 2024 couture collection.\n\n“Last night was a dream,” Moore wrote on Instagram this week. “It was an honor to grace the Cannes carpet in this stunning Schiaparelli gown to celebrate this film and the incredible people who made it. I am truly humbled and honored.”\n\nThe 77th annual Cannes Film Festival occurs from May 14 to 25. “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig serves as the jury president for this year’s festival, held in the South of France. Several high-profile premieres, including Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis” and “Furiosa” starring Anya Taylor-Joy, are expected to take place, while Meryl Streep will receive an honorary Palme d’Or."
