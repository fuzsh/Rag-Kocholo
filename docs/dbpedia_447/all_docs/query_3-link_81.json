Welp, it was apparently during that two-week period last month when every celebrity flocked to the South of France without you. And Page Six is out here claiming the friendship is \"flirty.\"\n\nThat! Said!!! An insider denied any sort of flirty vibe and said the two have simply \"struck up a friendship,\" have \"mutual friends,\" and \"bonded.\""
