        "text": "Demi Moore recently looked back on her time as part of the Brat Pack in the ’80s ahead of Andrew McCarthy‘s tell-all documentary about the iconic period in cinema.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Good Morning America, the St. Elmo’s Fire actress said, “Andrew really wanted to explore the impact it had on each of us because for him, it actually had a big impact,” per The Daily Mail. “For Rob [Lowe], it kind of just slid off his back.”\n\nShe then admitted, “For me, I didn’t love it, being thought of as a brat because I thought it kind of diminished us as professionals. But I didn’t carry it.”\n\nBut Moore noted that the nickname had nothing to do with how they acted professionally; it actually came about from a New York Magazine headline.\n\nMoore is set to appear in the doc alongside many of her former co-stars from that time, including Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, and more. Though she hasn’t “seen it yet,” Moore said she enjoyed reliving those glory days with McCarthy.\n\n“I really enjoyed my time with him sitting down and reminiscing,” Moore said. “And I was only sorry [all the actors] didn’t get a chance to all be together at one time. That would be, really, a treat, actually.”\n\nThe Brat Pack nickname was coined in 1984 by journalist David Blum, inspired in part by Frank Sinatra’s Rat Pack. Blum had initially set out to profile Estevez, but the moniker spread to include many of his frequent co-stars, including Moore, Sheedy, and Molly Ringwald.\n\nMcCarthy has said he used to feel similarly about the nickname when it first came out.\n\n“Over time, it’s become this iconically affectionate term — we’re like the avatars of a generation’s youth,” he recalled during an appearance on Sherri in 2023. “But at the time it wasn’t that. We took it as a very negative kind of thing. It’s interesting how things changed over time and how it’s become so beloved.”\n\nMcCarthy told Sherri he was inspired to revisit his former castmates after completing his memoir, Brat: An ’80s Story.\n\n“I wrote a book a couple of years ago about my time in the Brat Pack, and when I finished that I was like, ‘well what did everybody else think?’ And so I called them up and said, ‘Hey guys, do you mind if I come talk to you?’” he recalled. “And I went to everybody’s house and just sat down with a camera and talked to them about it.”\n\n“It was amazing how much affection we still had for each other and for our own youth,” he said.\n\nBrats is expected to premiere later this year on Hulu."
