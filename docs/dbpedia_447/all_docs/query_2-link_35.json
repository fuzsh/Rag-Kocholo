        "text": "That’s because the DTC swimwear brand’s latest collaboration is with the actor, producer, best-selling author, songwriter and women’s rights advocate Demi Moore.\n\nThe trailblazing multihyphenate’s limited-edition line comprises 10 styles inspired by Moore’s personal collection of vintage swimsuits. With names like The Marseilles, The Tropez and The Cannes, the suits harken back to Old Hollywood glamour but with modern-day fits.\n\nAccording to a statement, Moore sourced the fabrics from France and Italy, and the pieces are manufactured by a sustainable factory in Morocco.\n\nThe collection, available in bikinis as well as one-pieces in a variety of cuts, range from $75 to $155 and will be sold exclusively through the brand’s ecommerce channels and at pop-up shops in Sag Harbor, New York and Berkeley, California."
