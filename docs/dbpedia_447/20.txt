Demi Moore showcased her willingness to experiment with fashion at the ‘BRATS’ premiere during the 2024 Tribeca Festival.

However, her Schiaparelli Spring 2024 white cotton denim ensemble didn’t quite hit the mark for me.

The cowboy-inspired wide-leg jeans didn’t flatter her as well as some of her previous looks.

I feel like the Schiaparelli canvas sneakers with trompe-l’œil golden toes were a bold choice, but the label’s footwear continues to be a hard pass for me.

Nonetheless, it’s admirable that Demi continues to explore new styles and step out of her comfort zone. Not everyday is a high-glam day.
