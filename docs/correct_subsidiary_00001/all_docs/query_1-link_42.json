        "text": "Amazon is releasing the new Echo Spot, a new addition to the company’s lineup of Alexa devices, but this time in a bedside alarm clock form factor.\n\nThe $79.99 device is designed for a nightstand with a display that makes it easy to set and view alarms, see the time, weather, or song titles. The Echo Spot also features a directional speaker.\n\nThe tech giant says the Echo Spot builds on what customers love about the original product: it’s shape and form factor and access to Alexa. However, the Echo Spot adds better visuals and improved audio quality via a new 1.73-inch front-firing directional speaker.\n\nThe display can be customized with six different colorways and a variety of clock faces, and users can set alarms on Echo Spot by simply asking Alexa. The display will also show 10 unique response animations when saying things like, “Alexa, how are you,” or “Alexa, good evening.”\n\nAsking Alexa about the weather will also include an illustration, such as a sun, rain cloud, or snowflake.\n\nLike other Echo devices, users can connect Echo Spot to compatible smart home products to control devices, set up routines and automate daily asks.\n\nEcho Spot can also be used to make phone calls, make household announcements, and get alerts and audio from a compatible smart doorbell.\n\nAmazon says Echo Spot, like other Echo devices, is built with “multiple layers of privacy controls,” including the ability to turn the mic off, deleting voice recordings, and more\n\nThe device is normally $79.99, but will be $44.99 for Amazon Prime members through July 17 for Prime Day."
