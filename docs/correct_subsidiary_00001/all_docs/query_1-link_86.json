        "text": "Amazon describes its Alexa product as allowing users to instantly connect to Alexa to play music, control your smart home, and get information, news, weather, and more using just your voice. For Alexa, Amazon's policy states that it will store user messages in the cloud so that they’re available on the user's Alexa App and select Alexa Enabled Products. Amazon's policy explains that it will gather personal information, and the information it learns from customers helps them personalize and continually improve the user's Amazon experience. While the policy describes an account for the initial setup, for \"hands free\" devices, like the Amazon Echo, a user can access Alexa by saying the wake word (Alexa, Echo, Amazon, or Computer). The policy indicates that parental controls are available, and parents can add or update certain information.\n\nAmazon Alexa can be accessed through its website, and is available for download at the iOS App Store, the Google Play Store, and Amazon Appstore. The Privacy Policy and Terms of Use used for this evaluation can be found on Amazon Alexa’s website, iOS App Store, the Google Play Store, and Amazon Appstore. Additionally, other policies used for this evaluation include: Children's Privacy Disclosure. This evaluation only considers policies that have been made publicly available prior to an individual using the application or service.\n\nSafety\n\nAmazon's privacy policy notes that users may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information. Amazon's policy states that it reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content. For Alexa, Amazon's policy states that it will store user messages in the cloud so that they’re available on the user's Alexa App and select Alexa Enabled Products. For children using FreeTime on Alexa, Alexa will play music, answer questions, read stories, tell jokes, and more with younger ears in mind. The policy explains that a parent user can set up and manage their child's FreeTime on Alexa experience by visiting Settings > FreeTime in the Alexa app, and the Amazon Parent Dashboard allows parents to see their child's FreeTime on Alexa activity, including which skills their child has used. Like other voice recordings with Alexa, the policy explains that parents can review and delete FreeTime on Alexa voice recordings by visiting Settings > Alexa Account > History in the Alexa app.\n\nPrivacy\n\nAmazon's policy explains that it will gather personal information, and the information it learns from customers helps them personalize and continually improve the user's Amazon experience. For example, the Echo Look device uses photos to recommend new garments that will pair well with the tops and bottom the user wore. In order to receive recommendations, the photo must be taken with the Echo Look device and contain a visible outfit with a top and bottom (they can't currently provide pairing recommendations for dresses). With regard to third parties, Amazon's policy states that they do not have access to, or control over, cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by their Privacy Notice or this Interest-Based Ads page.\n\nHowever, Amazon's policy explains that it intends transparency in that a user can tell when a third party is involved, and it intends to minimize sharing in that it shares customer information related to those transactions with that third party. Also, Amazon's policy states that it does not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display interest-based ads. Third party providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Advertising preferences and customer communication preferences are available to adjust settings for personal information.\n\nSecurity\n\nFor Amazon Alexa products, the policy states that users provide their phone number when registering for Alexa Communication. For security purposes, the policy notes that Amazon will verify this number by sending the user an SMS message (carrier charges may apply). The policy explains that other users who know the user's contact details will be able to contact them using Alexa Communication, and that registration name and contact details may be used to identify the user to other users, and that the user's phone number also may be displayed as a caller ID on outbound calls. While the policy describes an account for the initial setup, for \"hands free\" devices, like the Amazon Echo, a user can access Alexa by saying the wake word (Alexa, Echo, Amazon, or Computer). For other devices, like certain Fire tablets, the policy details that a person can access Alexa by pressing a button. Amazon's policy states that it works to protect the security of user information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information the user inputs.\n\nCompliance\n\nAmazon's policy notes that they offer some services intended for children, and in some cases they may know a child is using the services (for example, when using a child profile). In these situations, the policy notes that children may share and Amazon may collect personal information that requires verifiable parental consent under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (collectively, \"Child Personal Information\"). However, its policy states that Amazon.com does not sell products for purchase by children, they only sell children's products for purchase by adults. If a user is under 18, the policy insists that user may use Amazon.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. In addition, by default, approval will be required for each voice purchase from Amazon through a kid skill before the purchase will be completed. Parents can allow purchases in kid skills without additional approval by changing this default setting in their Alexa app.\n\nFurther, Amazon's policy reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but also notes that it does not regularly review posted content. The policy indicates that parental controls are available, and parents can add or update certain information. However, Amazon notes that when a user updates information, it usually keeps a copy of the prior version for its records. Finally, the policy details that the company will use child personal information to provide and improve products and services, including personalizing offerings and recommendations for children, communicating information, enforcing parental controls, and giving parents visibility into how their children use products and services."
