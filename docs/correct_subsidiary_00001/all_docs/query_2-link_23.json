        "text": "There's so much your Amazon Alexaâ¢ device can do for youâplay music, check the weather, make to-do lists, announce the news. But your virtual assistant can't do its job unless it's online. If your device won't connect to Wi-Fi and you're not sure what to do, don't worry.\n\nHere at Asurion, we help people take care of all of their tech care needsâand that includes troubleshooting Wi-Fi connectivity issues. Here's what to do when your Echo, Echo DotÂ®, or Alexa-enabled device is not connecting to the Internet.\n\nConfirm that your Wi-Fi network name and password are correct\n\nIf you're having trouble connecting your virtual assistant to the internet, you should first make sure the correct wireless network and password are set up on your device. To verify that you've entered the correct Wi-Fi password:\n\nOpen the Alexa App on your phone.\n\nSelect Devices at the bottom.\n\nSelect Echo & Alexa, then select your device.\n\nSelect Change next to your Wi-Fi network to view the Wi-Fi sign-in details, and enter the correct password.\n\nCheck your internet connection\n\nIf you're now sure that your device is connected to Wi-Fi, confirm your internet connection is working properly. With your tablet, computer, or phone, connect to Wi-Fi and check your signal strength, then open a web browser or try getting online. If you have a strong Wi-Fi signal but you are unable to access the internet, your network is probably the problem, not your Alexa. In that case, you'll need to get in touch with your internet service provider.\n\nChange the band Alexa is connecting to\n\nIf you have a dual-band router, it comes with two Wi-Fi frequencies: 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz. The 2.4 GHz frequency band works better at certain distances, so switching to it can boost the signal strength of your router. Doing so is easier than it may seem, and only takes as long as it would to add a network name and password for Alexa in your app.\n\nOpen the Alexa App on your phone.\n\nSelect Devices at the bottom.\n\nSelect Echo & Alexa, then select your device.\n\nTap the Settings button at the top right, then tap Change next to the Wi-Fi option to switch the Wi-Fi band.\n\nRestart your Alexa-enabled device\n\nSometimes, a simple restart is all you need to get your Alexa device back online. Just unplug your device or the power adapter from the outlet, wait about 10 seconds, then plug it back in and connect to Wi-Fi. If it works, your problem is solved.\n\nMove your Alexa device closer to your router\n\nIf your virtual assistant still isn't connecting to Wi-Fi, make sure it's located within 30 feet of your wireless router. Physical barriers, like concrete or brick walls, and other electronic devices, like baby monitors and FM radios, can interfere with the signal. If you're looking to boost the strength and range of your wireless internet , check out our guide to wireless mesh networks.\n\nRestart your modem and wireless router\n\nSometimes network hardware causes Wi-Fi issues, so you'll want to manually restart the modem and wireless router (sometimes they are two separate pieces, but often they are combined in one device). Here's how:\n\nMake sure the router is connected to the modem and that your cables are plugged in securely.\n\nUnplug or press the Power button on the modem/router to turn it off.\n\nWait 30 seconds, then plug in or press the Power button on the modem/router to turn it back on.\n\nWhile your modem restarts, unplug the power adapter from your Echo device for 3 seconds, then plug it in again.\n\nWait 5 minutes, then check to see if the device you chose in the section above connects to the internet. If it does, your Alexa will too.\n\nYou'll also want to update your Wi-Fi router with the latest software. Check your router's manual or manufacturer's website to learn how.\n\nReset Alexa device to factory settings\n\nIf your Alexaâenabled Dot or Echo is still not connecting to the internet, it's time to reset your Alexa to its factory settings."
