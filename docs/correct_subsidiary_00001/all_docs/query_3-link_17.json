        "text": "Developers will be able to integrate their APIs or content into Alexa’s LLM and create experiences that allow customers to access real-time data, enjoy immersive generative AI-enhanced games, perform tasks like booking restaurant reservations, getting a succinct summary of a trending news story, and more. In addition, smart home developers will be able to model actions easily to enable customers to interact naturally with their devices. Volley implements AI as a core feature in their development of voice games for Alexa. Splash harnesses generative AI to empower a new breed of musicians, creating songs by voice through the Splash experience on Alexa.\n\nAlexa Fund Portfolio Companies: Volley | Splash\n\nThe Janky & Guggimon Show, starring the Superplastic synthetic celebrities Janky and Guggimon, is in development at Amazon Studios. The two companies have also signed a first-look deal to facilitate the creation of additional series and films starring other characters in the Superplastic universe. The Janky & Guggimon Show follows the adventures of two lazy and spectacularly incompetent best friends who are hell-bent on getting rich and famous but leave a trail of chaos and destruction in their wake. The endearing duo includes Janky, who spends his spare time scamming celebrities, and Guggimon, a fashion icon and master manipulator who’s too narcissistic to care.\n\nAlexa Fund Portfolio Company: Superplastic\n\nIn an exciting new collaboration, Amazon music and Berlin-based AI sound wellness app Endel will produce a sleep playlist, making Endel the first generative AI company to collaborate with the service on a playlist. Drawing on extensive research into the neuroscience of sleep, the playlist lasts roughly 8 hours or until the listener awakens, and is available only on Amazon music. The sleep playlist created with Amazon Music, titled \"Sleep Science\" opens with an Amazon Original track featuring electronic duo 5x5 (Kaskade and deadmau5) that was produced using the hit track \"Escape\" and released through AWAL. Catch up on the latest playlist linked below.\n\nAlexa Fund Portfolio Company: Endel\n\nSunrise’s approach to sleep monitoring centers around mandibular jaw movements. Much like the diaphragm supports breathing during sleep, the jaw also plays a key role. By focusing on these jaw movements, Sunrise delivers a high-precision tool for sleep diagnosis. And all it takes is an 8-gram sensor comfortably placed on the chin.\n\nThe Alexa Fund has been exploring new approaches to cutting-edge AI systems for some time now and Imbue stood out with its focus on building smarter agents that can reason their way through problems like humans,” said Paul Bernard, director of the Alexa Fund. “We’re proud to be an investor of Imbue and fully support their mission to develop the next-generation of AI agent capabilities.”\n\nPlanet Earth is getting a digital twin. A pair of friends who met during high school in an online forum are now using their PhDs in computer science to pioneer artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that will allow them to create an exact digital replica of the world — one that adds deep and rich layers of detail and nuance to the traditional online mapping experience.\n\nPicture this: Fast-growing startup raises a high eight-figure round. Then, a year later, it decides to raise another. Investors line up, and this time they pledge more money while giving the company a healthy valuation bump. Just a little over a year ago, Span announced that it had closed a $90 million Series B that valued the company at $410 million pre-money.\n\nVTubers — online personalities who use motion-capture-powered manga- and anime-inspired avatars to interact with the world alongside games, over YouTube, and in other places — have become big business, with the most popular of them collectively racking up hundreds of millions of hours of viewership in a month, along with loyal fan bases.\n\nAt the age of 12, Alex Wiltschko bought his first perfume, Azzaro pour Homme. He’d read about it in his favorite book — Perfumes: The Guide, by Luca Turin — and was thrilled to find it at a knock-down price at his local TJ Maxx. It would be the first in a large collection. For as long as he can remember, Wiltschko has been obsessed by scent. “It’s how I’m wired.\""
