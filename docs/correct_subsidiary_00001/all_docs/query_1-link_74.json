        "text": "So okay, I wrote a post about Apple‚Äôs AirPods last fall where I got a little‚Ä¶ excited. (Maybe you remember? It was the one where I called the AirPods ‚Äúsex sticks that fuck your ears?‚Äù (I stand by that line by the way, all the way). I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a similar assessment was in order this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amazon launched the Echo Show to great fanfare and consternation. I feel less riled up this time, but still want to add my 2c to put this device in the proper context‚Äîif only to make worthwhile the countless hours I‚Äôve spent doggedly investigating the front lines in the battle over the future of conversational products and technology writ large.\n\nTo clue you into my process, one of my tricks is to peer into the vastness of negative space and try to piece together what the pundits, analysts, naysayers, and enthusiasts aren‚Äôt seeing and aren‚Äôt saying. Not that they‚Äôre intentionally hiding anything, but sometimes they‚Äôre so close they can‚Äôt see what should be obvious to anyone with a little more distance. For example, for this device to succeed, it needs to achieve scale and ubiquity in order to change behavior and expectations. Yet pundits complain about the design or look of the product, when it‚Äôs likely the result of keeping COGs (cost of goods) low. Other times these folks fall back to their default assumptions in order to jump onto the hype train and use explanatory shortcuts to avoid the more time-intensive work of committing acts of original thinking. For example, evaluating this device as a poor, immobile substitute for an iPad misses the point entirely. That‚Äôs just a lazy brain barfing out whatever immediately came to mind on first glance.\n\nInstead, to understand the Amazon Echo Show we must think more broadly about computing ‚Äì as Steve Jobs did in the 80s, when he described various automobile makes (drawing a metaphor to forthcoming computers models) as just ‚Äúa difference in emphasis‚Äù.\n\nLet‚Äôs pretend we work at Amazon\n\nIf you know anything about Amazon‚Äôs product design process, you know that it is a literary one of epic proportions. I don‚Äôt know if this tradition springs forth from their origins in the book business, but every Amazon product starts as a pitch‚Äînot a pitch deck‚Äîbut as a four to six page treatise.\n\nEveryone involved reads these documents in the kick-off, not beforehand, not afterwards. This is so everyone starts literally on the same page, and everyone has time to read the same material. As a result, there‚Äôs no excuse for not being up to speed, nor for anyone on the team to not understand the value proposition for the end user. This process is also designed to force ‚Äúbetter thought and better understanding of what‚Äôs more important than what, and how things are related.‚Äù This is from Bezos himself in 2004:\n\nRegardless of the kick-off process, what got me thinking about this was the Echo Show launch video. It says so much and yet I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs really been examined closely enough.\n\nWhat we learn from the launch video\n\nTo follow along this next section, I strongly encourage to watch the full video, beginning to end. Go on. I‚Äôll wait.\n\nAmazon launch the Echo Show, a hands-free home-friendly device | Daily Mail Online\n\nEcho Show boasts eight microphones, compatible cameras and voice recognition as well as many of the features its‚Ä¶\n\nwww.dailymail.co.uk\n\nWelcome back. üòä\n\nFirst of all, the video is nearly five minutes long, easily a minute over the longest Apple product launch videos (contrast this with Apple‚Äôs Don‚Äôt Blink, 107 second spot for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus). The length feels unique to Amazon, and is designed, it seems, to dispel any hesitations a motivated shopper might have‚Äîkind of like one those super long make-money-now webpages that seem to go on forever and ever‚Ä¶ anyway, also important: the video dispenses with high tech mumbo-jumbo jargon and instead demonstrates the product in context, showing relatable human moments that are enhanced by the plain and accessible design of voice-enabled Alexa products.\n\nLike the hashtag, you can learn to use voice commands just by listening to and imitating other humans doing the thing you want to do. This transparency is critical to the eventual success of any social innovation.\n\nSecond, Amazon eschews the robopornographic style of Apple and Microsoft‚Äôs recent product videos. I mean, I love tight bezels and an a-loo-mini-um chassis like everyone else, but the aesthetic Amazon was after here was more Sears than Saks Fifth Avenue. Even the post-production colorization invokes a Michael-Scott-creamy-office-beige motif.\n\nOh, and not to dwell on color too long, but did you notice that every actor in the video was white? I bring this up not to criticize (since Amazon is aiming directly at middle America with this product) but instead to highlight the contrast between more Millennial-focused social spots for Spectacles and Instagram that go out of their way (sometimes ridiculously so) to depict a future that is fun, inclusive, and multi-multi-multi-! (e.g. -ethnic, -cultural, -racial, -gendered, etc).\n\nAnh, well, fine, since you‚Äôre asking, here‚Äôs the cast to prove my point:\n\nThe fifth is in Grandma #2‚Äôs living room (Grandma #2 appears on the Echo Show in the kid‚Äôs room):\n\nThat‚Äôs five Echo Shows (totalling $1149.95, unless you spring for a 2-pack for $100 off with code SHOW2PACK) for a single family. (And curiously, nary an Echo Dot nor an Echo made an appearance.)\n\nSo: the Echo Show is designed to live in shared common areas with multiple household users (Amazon needs to catch up to Google Home‚Äôs multi-voice recognition!), and should be used (like the Echo) during tasks that require your hands: washing the dishes, cutting flowers, painting the walls, changing diapers, reading a magazine, and so on. Note that several of these activities could be completed with a handheld device, but if you apply the constraint that you must leave the smartphone in your pocket (or erase it from the picture completely), these human use cases are relatable and reasonable. Ok, I get it: convenience, access, and communication throughout the home. üëå\n\nBeing unremarkable: an aesthetic apart\n\nThe Echo Show is interesting not because it‚Äôs novel, but because it‚Äôs unremarkable and fits a familiar invisible technology pattern. As Matthew Panzarino points out, the form factor isn‚Äôt new, and that‚Äôs a good thing:\n\nBy being familiar, the Echo Show can become invisible. Its purchase is a thoughtless act: literally, you really don‚Äôt have to think that hard about it. Does it address a few common problems for you? Okay, great. Buy it. It‚Äôs Kindle-simple.\n\nTo further this point, and as others have pointed out, the Echo Show isn‚Äôt sexy:\n\nThese aesthetics aren‚Äôt an accident. In contrast to nearly anything Apple designs or that Google or Samsung chases after, by aiming for a less navel-gazy aesthetic, Amazon is targeting a very specific (but broad) kind of consumer:\n\nContrast the understated Echo Show‚Äôs muteness to the Google Home, which was designed to be a showpiece:\n\nTalk about ostentatious! As Steve Jobs once said: Yuck! Who wants that?!\n\nAnd he‚Äôs right. Where future vision videos like Microsoft‚Äôs fail is in the centricity and importance of the looks of the technology, rather than how it makes the user feel (which, for Amazon‚Äôs user base, should be ‚Äúnot stupid‚Äù‚Äîindeed a low bar, but one that many products still fail at.)\n\nThe Echo Show looks common and unassuming because it‚Äôs meant to be common and unassuming. It‚Äôs the Myspace of product design, where the content (video calls, music, home automation) and the user‚Äôs confidence in using it will determine whether people will buy it‚Äîlargely the opposite draw from an Apple device (like the AirPods).\n\nThis is at the heart of understanding Amazon‚Äôs strategy, and why we in Silicon Valley who have been obsessed with drop shadows and rounded corners and killing off skeuomorphism may miss the point: just like we saw with last year‚Äôs election, my sense is that there are a lot of people in the world who feel left out, left behind, or angered by the sharp increase in advances in technology, from AI to inscrutable #CameraFirst apps to untrustworthy newsfeeds, to the rest of it. As Joi Ito so astutely points out in his book Whiplash, change is hard, and change is coming faster than ever before in human history. We technologists are the liberal elites that deserve both the credit and the blame for advancing modernity while not doing more to bring the rest of the world along with us.\n\nAs it gets harder and harder to keep up as screens infuse every aspect of our waking lives, the rapid adoption of the voice-first computing paradigm is one way that people are fighting back. We see each other absorbed in our phones and we know something isn‚Äôt sustainable about the future this widespread behavior portends. We‚Äôre quicksand-sliding into Idiocracy, with less and less agency to choose an alternative path. Those who do risk being left behind as the divide grows between technology-haves (i.e. those who engage in choices about how and which technologies to incorporate into their lives) and technology-have nots (i.e. those who begrudgingly adopt technology due to peer pressure).\n\nAnd so I want to leave you with one parting thought, and it‚Äôs a big one.\n\nA tale of two futures\n\nIf Apple is a fashion brand that makes jewelry that connects to the internet, then Amazon is a meta-merchant that inverts the retail model by integrating the point of sale into your life. These two approaches determine how each company will spend the next decade, setting up a cultural dichotomy of epic proportions.\n\nIn Apple‚Äôs future, technology products should be luxury goods that give the owner an elite or exclusive feeling, even as they become increasingly ubiquitous. Apple sets the fashion trends by designing lustworthy devices that inspire awe and desire. In Apple‚Äôs world (like BMW‚Äôs before it), people have an enduring and emotional relationship with their technological accoutrements. The personal computing device (the iPhone, AirPods, and Ô£ø·¥°·¥Ä·¥õ·¥Ñ ú specifically) is the pinnacle of Apple‚Äôs achievements. Dieter Rams would be proud.\n\nBut Amazon‚Äôs approach to the future is necessarily different.\n\nIn Amazon‚Äôs future, its technology products are merely a means to an end: increased commerce. Be it drones, reading devices, voice cylinders, video intercoms, autonomous vehicles, its line of AmazonBasics electronics, or obsoleting the checkout process‚Äîthese innovations aren‚Äôt designed to create more intimacy with its customers‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre designed to decrease the time between the moment demand appears and how fast supply can respond. Amazon won‚Äôt stop until the entire supply chain has been absorbed and internalized.\n\nWhat we see in the Echo Show video is Amazon scratching away at the sheen of today‚Äôs leading technology products and asserting a more utilitarian aesthetic. By reducing the importance of appearance, Amazon can emphasize function over form, keep its prices anticompetitively low, and drown the market with products that offer access to its AI voice assistant. Don‚Äôt be confused:\n\nLike an army on the march, Amazon is marshalling all of its resources to succeed in this goal, and it‚Äôs already achieved a whopping 70% market share, according to eMarketer:\n\nThe stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher\n\nThe outcome of this battle may well bring about the end of the concept of the personal computer, at least as we‚Äôve known it for the last 20 years.\n\nIn its place, we will start to live in a ‚Äúfield of computing‚Äù, where, yes, we may have certain digital accomplices that stowaway on our bodies and are used to notify and identify us, but the nose-to-the-phone model of personal computing may already be on its way out.\n\nDoubt me? Just consider the eventual decline of other previous seismic advances like the horse and buggy, the locomotive, the newspaper, telegraph, radio, or TV. Each shaped the thoughts of a generation or two, but inevitability withered in the face of new advances.\n\nThe smartphone‚Äôs had a great run over the last decade and may yet have another 10 years to go, but trust me, computing is breaking out of the confines of metal and glass boxes designed as jewelry and meant to be ‚Äúworn‚Äù. Computing is already becoming more diffuse, and if Amazon has its way, Alexa will become the primary conduit through which you reach the internet and connect to the world, wherever you are.\n\nSoon we‚Äôll see Alexa taking a ride with us in the car, saying hello on street corners, greeting us in hotels, and hanging out in our TVs and refrigerators. Make no mistake: Amazon is grinding the very concept of the personal computer into dust.\n\nIn its place it is positioning Alexa, an AI artifice that lives in the cloud and with whom you build a lifetime relationship. You will buy devices to gain access to her, for sure, just like at one time you might have bought a landline or a cell phone to call your family members‚Äîstaying in touch was that important. Now you‚Äôll do the same to stay connected to Alexa. You‚Äôll buy technology not for its specs but for the access it grants you.\n\nMaybe you think this isn‚Äôt such a big deal, but then again, maybe it‚Äôs just a matter of emphasis."
