It can also interrupt ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle also revealed upgraded versions of its Gemini chatbot as well as improvements to its search engine last week.\n\nApple, too, is planning an AI overhaul for its Siri virtual assistant - which is seen as another laggard in the AI race - according to media reports.\n\nThe CNBC report said Amazon would use its own Titan large language model for the Alexa upgrade.\n\nThe company has made hefty bets on AI, including a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, whose Claude chatbot competes with ChatGPT.\n\nStill, investors worry that Microsoft's early lead in the AI race through its OpenAI investment could help it wrest a bulk of market share in the cloud industry from Amazon Web Services, the largest player in the space.\n\nWhy leading doctors and scientists pin hope on green jackfruit to fight fatty liver and cancer\n\nYoungsters are roaming around derivatives fire.
