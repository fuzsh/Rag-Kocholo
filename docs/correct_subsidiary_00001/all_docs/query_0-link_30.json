        "text": "(IDG) -- Amazon.com subsidiary Alexa Internet has agreed to compensate users for collecting personal information.\n\nAs part of a settlement for a series of lawsuits, Alexa will pay up to $1.9 million to users whose personally identifiable information is found in the company's database, Alexa's president said Friday.\n\nAlexa offers a service that rates Web content for users and provides information about related links and contact information for sites they visit. It does this by way of a browser add-on that retrieves information including URLs about the pages its users visit.\n\nIDG.net INFOCENTER\n\nPCWorld.com home\n\nFree daily newsletters\n\nPCWorld.com: Week in Reviews\n\nTechInformer\n\nFeatures\n\nTop 15 notebook PCs\n\nAn inside tour of the Pentium 4\n\nSurviving a disk crash: A checklist\n\nVisit an IDG site IDG.net search\n\nIn a series of class action lawsuits filed against Alexa beginning last year, plaintiffs charged that Alexa collected and stored their personal information in violation of privacy laws.\n\nThe settlement requires Alexa to pay up to $40 to each user whose personal information is found in its database. The San Francisco-based company also agreed to donate $100,000 to Internet public-policy programs and consumer groups, and has agreed to delete data it has collected that could be tied to individual users, says Alexa President Brewster Kahle.\n\n\"We're confident we would have prevailed in trial,\" Kahle says. \"We entered the settlement to prevent the eventual costs of entering a trial.\"\n\nAmazon.com officials declined to comment, referring questions to Alexa.\n\nKahle claims that his company doesn't know how much information about its users is stored in the database.\n\n\"Alexa has a lot of users,\" he said. \"How much personal information [is there]? We don't know, we've never looked.\"\n\nHe says the company has a tough privacy policy in place and has never tried to match any of the data that is collected to individual users.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nVoter.com to sell membership list\n\nMarch 16, 2001\n\nInjunction overturned in Amazon one-click case\n\nFebruary 15, 2001\n\nNew Web technology: Patently unfair?\n\nJuly 5, 2000\n\nNet-patent boom forces Patent Office to seek help\n\nSeptember 20, 1999\n\nE-businesses vie for technology ownership\n\nMarch 10, 2000\n\nRELATED IDG.net STORIES:\n\nNew tools attack privacy issues\n\n(Network World Fusion)\n\nUtilities clean cookie crumbs from your hard drive\n\n(PCWorld.com)\n\nOnline privacy survey finds conflicting views\n\n(IDG.net)\n\n12 keys to keeping your company safe\n\n(CIO)\n\nSecret tips for Internet privacy\n\n(PCWorld.com)\n\nAmazon figures out the future of e-commerce\n\n(Network World Fusion)\n\nClose is good enough for Amazon bounty\n\n(The Industry Standard)\n\nHack of Amazon.com's Bibliofind compromises customer data\n\n(Computerworld)\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nAmazon.com\n\nAlexa Internet\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
