However, Alexa and other voice bots are becoming more popular and can serve as useful channels to reach customers. It is important to pay attention to the developments and new functionalities and revisit them on occasion. You never know when a competitor may come along with a killer Alexa skill that you may regret not implementing sooner.",

        "text": "Oleg Dulin is a Big Data software engineer and consultant in the New York City area.\n\nIn 1997 Oleg co-founded Clarkson University Linux Users Group. This group was influential in bringing awareness of open-source to Clarkson, and later morphed into what now is a dedicated lab and curriculum called Clarkson Open Source Institute. While at Clarkson, Oleg advocated on behalf of open-source and Linux and community and helped with construction of Clarkson’s first open-source high-performance computing cluster called “The North Country.”\n\nWhile at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center in 1999-2000 Oleg co-authored a paper on federated information systems that was presented at Engineering of Federated Information Systems (EFIS) conference in 2000. This R&D project involved building a proof-of-concept federated IS that integrated structured (SQL) and unstructured (multi-media) data under a single set of API and user interfaces.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003 Oleg worked as a data integration consultant at a major investment bank in NYC on a web portal for private banking. This project involved aggregation of secure financial data from multiple legacy databases and presenting it in a customizable web portal.\n\nIn 2004, while working at a startup called ConfigureCode, Oleg contributed to two patent applications involving construction and semantic validation of mixed-schema XML documents. This technology was utilized in a Data Capture and Tracking System for Human Resources data integration.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2011 Oleg worked at a Wall St. company (see Oleg’s LinkedIn Profile for more details) where he was instrumental in improving data quality, reducing trading errors, implementing analytics and reporting within the context of an equities order management system. The system was a 24/7 high performance computing platform that processed billions of dollars worth of trade executions daily.\n\nFrom fall of 2011 to end of 2016, Oleg worked at Liquid Analytics as Cloud Platform Architect, where he was a thought leader in the implemention of a cloud-based PaaS for mobile Business Intelligence.\n\nPresently, Oleg works at ADP Innovation Lab as Chief Architect."
