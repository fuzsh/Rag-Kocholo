        "text": "Topline\n\nAmazon is considering charging customers up to $10 a month for a revamped, AI-enabled version of its currently free voice assistant Alexa, Reuters reported Friday, suggesting a major overhaul for the money-losing service is on the horizon as the retail giant fights to remain competitive in the generative AI race.\n\nKey Facts\n\nWhat Is “revamped Alexa” And Why Would People Pay For It?\n\nWhile company leaders have announced plans to update and refresh Alexa, few details have been made public about what this actually means. It is expected that Alexa’s conversational abilities will be more sophisticated and customers will be able to use the embedded AI to help with shopping and other tasks like writing emails and ordering food, as well as to streamline the use of smart devices — those connected to the internet — around the home. Given that Alexa has been freely available for nearly a decade now, it is unclear why Amazon customers will now shell out for Alexa services or how Amazon plans to go about persuading them to upgrade from a free tier to a paid one.\n\nKey Background\n\nReuters’ report is the first to outline a potentially stratified service, associated monthly fee and target launch date for “Remarkable Alexa.” It fleshes out earlier details speculating on the new product reported by the likes of Business Insider which, if true, would mark the largest overhaul to the service since it was introduced in 2014. The service has yet to make Amazon money and the rapid uptake of generative AI tools like ChatGPT have led to questions about its future. Efforts to reimagine Alexa have reportedly been plagued by technical issues, internal politics and poor morale, the latter of which has not been helped by cuts to the retail giant’s hardware division, mass layoffs and the departure of key leaders. While Alexa and its ability to respond to spoken commands felt groundbreaking 10 years ago, advances in generative AI have left the service feeling dated amid impressive AI assistants launched by Amazon’s tech rivals like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, which can respond swiftly and handle complicated queries. Amazon management reportedly view 2024 as a “must win” year for Alexa and the company’s AI efforts against rivals deploying increasingly sophisticated AI tools.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos is the second richest person in the world with a net worth of $203.5 billion. Bezos owns The Washington Post and space venture Blue Origin and has said he plans to give away most of his fortune during his lifetime.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.
