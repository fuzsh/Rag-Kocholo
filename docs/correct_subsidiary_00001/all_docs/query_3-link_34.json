        "text": "Ethan McAfee is CEO and Founder of Amify, the first turnkey Amazon-as-a-service provider.\n\nIn the world of e-commerce, there’s one undisputed leader: Amazon. As consumers changed their buying behavior in 2020, the retail giant’s financial results revealed a 38% increase in net sales. And those habits are unlikely to change. A study by Salesforce found that nearly 60% of consumers believe that they'll do even more online shopping after the pandemic than they did before.\n\nIt’s unsurprising then that Amazon is expected to seize 50% of the entire e-commerce retail market this year. Yet there’s still plenty of room for growth. E-commerce sales still only accounted for 14% of total retail sales in 2020, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nSo, what is Amazon doing so well that it’s in a “prime” position to gain an even bigger slice of this pie? I help brands sell more strategically on Amazon every day, and here is what my experience tells me about why Amazon will likely continue its dominance and why brands may want to consider developing an Amazon strategy, and fast.\n\n1. Amazon Still Leads In Logistics\n\nToday, Amazon has just about perfected the art of delivering goods in two days or less. With its own fleet of delivery vehicles, massive numbers of warehouses opening close to end customers for the fastest delivery times, and a workforce that increased by 50% in the past year, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to beat Amazon when it comes to logistics.\n\nBut the company is also a prediction powerhouse. Amazon has mastered the art of using artificial intelligence and analytics to understand and predict buyer behavior and demand so that it can put goods in the hands of consumers faster than ever.\n\nThat’s not to say Amazon doesn’t have competition. Walmart is now the second-largest e-commerce retailer in the United States, but it still lags far behind Amazon.\n\n2. Amazon Isn’t Just Convenient; It’s The Default Shopping Channel For Many\n\nWith so many competitively priced products, a powerful recommendation engine, a one-click “Buy Now” option and free delivery on Prime goods, Amazon has removed many elements of friction from the buying experience.\n\nNow compare this with other digital shopping experiences. Say you’re in the market for a new pair of tennis shoes. If you have a specific brand in mind, you may have to go to its website, search for the product and even compare across websites. When you’re ready to buy, you may be required to create an account that you’ll likely use only once, input your credit card details, and then sit back and wait. You might have no idea when your goods will ship or arrive. With Amazon, you know when you’ll likely receive a product even before you place an order.\n\nFor these reasons, Amazon seems to be the default shopping channel for many consumers. If brands aren’t on Amazon, they could be losing out to competitors who are. Consider that 78% of searches on Amazon are unbranded. When shopping for tennis shoes, many consumers aren’t searching for Nike; they’re searching for options, and brands can benefit from being visible among the available choices.\n\n3. Amazon Continues To Create Value For Customers\n\nThe final reason Amazon will likely continue to snag market share is that it excels at ensuring it remains top of mind. The Amazon Prime membership and its shopping and shipping perks are just one example. But Amazon has taken its brand experience several steps further. Amazon Prime can be connected to an Alexa device, creating another convenient way for consumers to order their favorite products or stream music. Prime also offers access to Prime Video, Prime Reading, Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, Prime Wardrobe, Amazon Key and much more — all seamlessly managed via a single account.\n\nThat’s a whole lot of value that is unmatched by Walmart or any other e-commerce retailer and unlikely to be replicated. It’s no wonder Amazon Prime is expected to have more than 153 million U.S. members by 2022.\n\nAcknowledging The Power Of Amazon\n\nSo where does this leave brands that are not on Amazon? Amazon has a thriving third-party seller program that accounted for 55% of the goods it sold in the last quarter of 2020. Yet many brands worry that selling on Amazon will cannibalize their existing e-commerce strategy, or that they’ll lose control over their brand experience. I’d argue otherwise.\n\nLike it or not, brands must meet customers where they are, whether on their own website or on the leading e-commerce site. Right now, many brands' products are likely being sold on Amazon even if they are not the ones selling them. This means that they have already lost control of their brand experience simply by not being present. Many brands see significant misrepresentation of their products by resellers on third-party platforms, along with pricing that falls outside of minimum advertised pricing policies. This can lead to unsatisfied customers whose ire is directed back at the brand, rather than the seller.\n\nIf you have not yet dipped your toes into Amazon’s waters, you may want to think less about one channel cannibalizing another and look instead at maximizing the best channels to increase sales overall while giving you more control over your brand experience. If a fair percentage of your buyers are already on Amazon, and if third-party sellers are reselling your products on the channel with less-than-optimal regard for your brand messages and profit margins, then it's where you need to be.\n\nTo kick-start your Amazon presence, the first step is to rip the bandage off and create your Amazon Seller Central account. From there, define a channel strategy and ensure that it aligns with your company’s overall sales strategy.\n\nMany of the world’s leading brands have acknowledged Amazon as an important direct-to-consumer channel and a potential extension of their website. Given the power of Amazon’s logistics, its position as an almost default channel for many U.S. consumers and its ability to add customer value with its perks and cross-Amazon services, it is simply too large and valuable a channel for brands to ignore any longer."
