If so, and the issue persists, would you mind mentioning the troubleshooting steps you've done so far?\n\nLastly, include in your next response the make, model and OS version of your device, along with the Spotify version you're currently running.\n\nWe'll be on the lookout.\n\nOscarDCModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nAre you new to the Community? Take a moment to introduce yourself!\n\nHi @OscarDC,\n\nYes I tried the steps suggested but that did not work for me.\n\nAfter trying the steps suggested I reopened the Spotify app and it had a prompt asking to connect to Alexa. When I did that it worked.\n\nI am using a Samsung S22 android phone with app version 8.7.68.568\n\nThanks\n\nHey @stefarg,\n\nThank you for your swift response and the info you sent.\n\nJust to be clear, are you still having the issue? Or is it working good after you reconnect them with the prompt you get?\n\nWe'll be on the lookout.\n\nOscarDCModerator\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate an answer, maybe give it a Like.\n\nAre you new to the Community? Take a moment to introduce yourself!\n\nI had the same issue, I tried several ways to solve the problem but none of them worked for me, so by mistake I entered my Spotify app and I clicked on the settings button, and then I went to section called \"Voice Assistants & Apps\" and I could link it from there and now it works perfectly.\n\nI had the same issue and just managed to figure it out!!\n\nThe Spotify screen in Alexa app wouldn’t work for med it stayed blank. If you go to your Spotify app, go to Settings, Voice Assistants & Apps, there should be a box with Amazon Alexa in it. Click ‘Link’ and it should bring you to the Alexa app and then it worked for me! I had to try it a couple of times as some error came up on my Spotify the first time, if it doesn’t work try uninstall/reinstall.\n\nalso before doing this I used a link somewhere on one of these forums to revoke access to Alexa via my Spotify, so you might need to do that first!"
