        "text": "Amazon is one of the most recognisable brands in the world, and the third largest by revenue. It was the fourth tech company to reach a $1 trillion market cap, and a market leader in e-commerce, cloud, advertising, video streaming, and music streaming.\n\nOriginally launched as an online bookstore in 1995, Amazon spent its first few years as a brokerage for other sellers, similar to eBay. However, founder Jeff Bezos always envisioned it would be an “everything store” and quickly added other items to the e-commerce platform.\n\nBy the start of the 2000s, Amazon already had its own distribution hubs, although it wouldn’t be until later on in the decade when it started its own delivery services.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was also launched at the start of the 2000s, originally built to help third-party retailers build websites quickly. It has since become the largest cloud computing business in the world, with over 30 percent market share.\n\nAs Amazon’s e-commerce platform continued to grow, Amazon looked for new ways to generate revenue. It launched the Kindle, an e-reader, in 2007, as the primary hardware for its Kindle e-book store. It also launched tablets and connected TV devices, under the Fire brand.\n\nNot all of Amazon’s hardware has been successful, in 2014, it launched the Fire Phone, which had a clunky 3D screen. Like the HTC First (Facebook Phone), it failed to capture an audience in the US or abroad and was cancelled soon after.\n\nTo get customers locked in to the platform, Amazon created Prime in 2005. The service provided subscribers with free delivery on most items, and Amazon has added video and music streaming, alongside other services.\n\nThis has been a massive hit for Amazon, with over half of all US adults having a Prime membership. Through this, Amazon has built out its product portfolio, with acquisitions of key movie studios such as MGM Studios for $8.4 billion in 2021.\n\nIn 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch.TV for $970 million, a live streaming service primarily dedicated to games. In 2017, it made its largest acquisition to date, paying $17.4 billion for Whole Foods. Both were plays to move deeper into markets they were already dabbling in.\n\nA year after the acquisition of Whole Foods it launched Go, a small chain of stores which use cameras and sensors instead of cashiers. Amazon has launched eight stores so far in the US, but has failed to interest any third-party retailers in setting up their own Go stores.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest competitors in the Internet of Things market, with the Amazon Echo as the hub and Alexa as the personal assistant. It acquired Ring doorbell for $1 billion in 2018 and has since launched other types of Echo devices.\n\nWhile Amazon still makes a majority of its revenue from its e-commerce platform, it has seen huge increases in revenue from AWS, subscriptions and advertising in the past few years. The coronavirus pandemic provided Amazon with a boost in sales across the board.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on Amazon.
