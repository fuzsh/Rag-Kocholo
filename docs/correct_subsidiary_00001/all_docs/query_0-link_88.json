Each PoP can host many IPs to deliver an application. A sample IP is provided.\n\nTake special note of CDNs that use Anycast technology. Anycast makes it possible to route a single IP address to a variety of different geographic locations. In other words, one global Anycast IP is hosted in multiple geographic locations."
