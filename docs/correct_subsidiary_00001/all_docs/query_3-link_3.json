        "text": "Overview\n\nUsers can activate the program by simply stating the name “Alexa,” though it is possible to change the wake word to “Amazon,” “Echo,” “computer,” or “Ziggy.” “Alexa” was chosen by Amazon because it contains the uncommon “x” sound, which minimizes the chance that users accidentally awaken the device. According to Amazon employees, the name is also a reference to the Library of Alexandria, which supposedly held all of the world’s knowledge.\n\nAfter a user speaks the wake word, an Alexa-equipped smart device uses its microphone to transmit the user’s questions or commands to Alexa Voice Service (AVS), a cloud-based voice recognition and natural language understanding service. AVS converts the user’s words into text format by analyzing characteristics of their speech such as frequency and pitch. The resulting text is then matched with one of Alexa’s “skills”—tasks which AVS is capable of performing (e.g., playing music on the Spotify application). As of 2023 Alexa has more than 130,000 skills.\n\nHistory\n\nAmazon Lab126, a subsidiary responsible for much of Amazon’s research and development, secretly began development of a voice-controlled computer in 2011 under the code name Doppler. In order to obtain the data necessary to complete the project, the company acquired several small start-ups. One such company was the Polish start-up Ivona, which Amazon bought for $30 million in 2012 (a fact that the Amazon waited a year to announce). Ivona’s speech-synthesizing program Spiker became the basis for Alexa.\n\nOriginally, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wanted a voice-controlled computer to feature dozens of voices, with each one linked to a different set of tasks, but this ambition was not realized in the final version of Alexa. Instead, the team focused on developing just one voice, which they selected by writing out a list of desirable qualities, such as trustworthiness and warmth. Research suggested that such traits were most commonly associated with female voices, which is where the team focused its efforts. The voice eventually chosen is believed to belong to Nina Rolle, a voice actor and singer based in Boulder, Colorado, but neither Amazon nor Rolle have ever confirmed this. Once the voice actor was selected, her voice was recorded by an Atlanta-based voice-over studio called GM Voices, which had previously worked with Apple to create the voice of Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant.\n\nGiving Alexa a voice was in many ways an easier task for Alexa’s creators; it was more challenging to enable Alexa (or rather, AVS) to listen. Teaching Alexa to recognize questions and commands required training the program on a large number of voice samples. To obtain this data, Amazon hired the Australian data collection firm Appen, which rented homes and apartments in which temp workers read canned lines and verbally responded to open-ended prompts such as, “Ask to play your favorite song.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The company’s wariness proved unnecessary as the Echo was an instant success. By the end of 2016 Amazon had sold more than eight million Echoes and Echo Dots (a smaller, cheaper version of the Echo); by 2019 the company had sold more than 100 million Alexa devices. At that point, Alexa was the top selling speaker company in the world.\n\nEvolution of Alexa\n\nIn addition to Echoes and Echo Dots, Amazon has introduced a variety of other Alexa-enabled devices, including the Echo Show and Echo Auto; the technology has been added to preexisting products like Amazon’s Fire TV as well. Amazon now allows manufacturers to bring Alexa’s capabilities to their own connected devices. Alexa’s popularity led Amazon to possess an approximately 70 percent share of the U.S. market for virtual assistant programs in 2019 (its closest competitor, Google, owned just over 30 percent). Additionally, celebrity voices such as Samuel L. Jackson and Melissa McCarthy had been added to Alexa devices for an extra charge, but the feature was removed in 2023.\n\nIn September 2023 Amazon’s senior vice president of devices and services, Dave Limp, revealed during a Bloomberg TV interview that Amazon would begin using its own large language model (LLM) to improve Alexa, called AlexaLLM. Limp stated that the artificial intelligence program would improve Alexa’s understanding of speech over time by listening in to user conversations. He also added that Alexa would be able to interpret body language (if its device included a camera) and vocal intonation in order to determine when it is being addressed, even if the user does not use a wake word. Alexa’s own intonations would also change based on the context of the conversation.\n\nAlexa’s ubiquity has deeply alarmed privacy advocates who criticize its ability to record conversations occurring in its proximity and Amazon’s hunger for additional data. Amazon gives users the ability to delete voice recordings and to disable future recordings but gives notice that user experience may be less optimal. In 2015 the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) called on the U.S. government to investigate “always-on” devices such as Alexa. In her 2018 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff grimly describes Alexa’s arrival as a “threshold event” in the evolution of “One Voice”: the surveillance ecosystem that enables its operator “to anticipate and monetize all the moments of all the people during all the days.”"
