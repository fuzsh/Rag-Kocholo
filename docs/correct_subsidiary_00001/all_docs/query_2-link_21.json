        "text": "eero Built-in is our newest technology that turns select Echo products into eero mesh wifi extenders. Add up to 1,000 sq. ft. of coverage to your existing eero network and support speeds up to 100 Mbps for 10 or fewer connected devices in the 5 GHz band. No additional charge with a compatible Echo device, just more wifi for all. In case of any issues, here's a list of eero, Echo, and Alexa features that may be incompatible with eero Built-in.\n\nYou will need a compatible Echo device and a compatible eero mesh wifi router to enable the free feature. eero Built-in is currently only available in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom.\n\nFirst, set up your eero router and network. Then, set up your compatible Echo device in the Alexa app, and link your Amazon account in the eero app to enable eero Built-in. The Echo device will automatically extend your eero wifi network. For more information on how to set up eero Built-in, read this article.\n\neero Built-in on your compatible Echo device extends your eero wifi coverage up to 1,000 sq. ft., supports speeds up to 100 Mbps, and enables up to 10 connected devices (all in the 5 GHz band).\n\nBoth eero Built-in capabilities extend eero’s wifi technology, including TrueMesh, to non-eero hardware. However, with an eero Built-in wifi router device such as the Ring Alarm Pro, the device has the full functionality of a Wi-Fi 6 router (learn more about Ring Alarm Pro here). With an eero Built-in wifi extender, like the Echo Dot (5th Gen), the device simply extends your existing router’s range, but still requires a separate router.\n\nToo many device signals can cause interference and cause poor device performance. Given eero devices generally support higher internet speeds than eero Built-in on a compatible Echo device, eero prioritizes using a nearby eero device over a nearby Echo device if their coverage areas significantly overlap. eero intelligently detects when your eero devices are already providing great coverage and to disable eero Built-in on your Echo device as needed."
