        "text": "Amazon is a consumer e-commerce platform with a diversified business model spanning across e-commerce, cloud, advertising, streaming, and more. Over the years Amazon acquired several companies. Among its 12 subsidiaries, Amazon has AbeBooks.com, Audible, CamiXology, Fabric.com, IMDb, PillPack, Shopbop, Souq.com, Twitch, Whole Foods Market, Woot! and Zappos.\n\nAmazon has many known subsidiaries, with a culture of mergers and acquisitions starting in the late 1990s after an IPO amid the dot-com bubble.\n\nWhen many of these dot-com companies went bankrupt in the early 2000s, the company became more cautious and only invested in two companies between 2000 and 2004.\n\nIn 2005, however, the strategy recommenced in earnest as Amazon acquired a mixture of media websites and online retailers.\n\nFrom 2011 onward, the company broadened its focus with acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, live streaming, and grocery industries to name just a few.\n\nWhile we could never list them all, below is a selection of five Amazon subsidiaries.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nAudible: Acquired by Amazon in 2008, Audible is a leading provider of audiobooks and spoken-word content. It offers a wide range of digital audiobooks across various genres and has become a popular platform for both consumers and authors.\n\nIMDb (Internet Movie Database): Acquired by Amazon in 1998, IMDb is a comprehensive online database of information related to movies, television shows, actors, directors, and more. It has grown to be one of the most visited entertainment websites, offering reviews, ratings, and information about various productions.\n\nZappos: Amazon acquired Zappos in 2009. Zappos is an online shoe and clothing retailer known for its exceptional customer service and wide selection of products. It operates as a subsidiary of Amazon but maintains its distinct brand and company culture.\n\nTwitch: Acquired by Amazon in 2014, Twitch is a popular live streaming platform primarily focused on video game streaming and esports. It has expanded to include various types of content, such as creative broadcasts and music streaming, making it a significant player in the online entertainment industry.\n\nWhole Foods Market: Acquired by Amazon in 2017, Whole Foods Market is a well-known upscale grocery store chain that emphasizes natural and organic products. This acquisition marked Amazon’s entry into the grocery industry and allowed it to expand its presence in the physical retail space.\n\nRead: Amazon Business Model.\n\nWhole Foods Market\n\nWhole Foods Market is a multinational supermarket chain with a particular focus on organic food choices that are free from artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives.\n\nThe chain has more than 500 stores across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAmazon purchased Whole Foods Market in 2017 for more than $13 billion.\n\nAt the time, the chain was struggling to compete against grocery chains such as Kroger and Safeway that were undercutting its organic food prices.\n\nRead: Amazon Business Model.\n\nTwitch Interactive\n\nTwitch is a video live streaming platform for esports and video game broadcasts, real-life streams, and other creative content.\n\nTwitch emerged from the popular video game category of Justin.tv in 2011 with a newly formed parent company known as Twitch Interactive.\n\nThree years later, Amazon purchased the company in a deal worth $970 million.\n\nThis gave Amazon a significant presence in video games and immersive technology – both lucrative industries that are redefining the ways consumers interact online.\n\nRead: Amazon Business Model.\n\nSouq\n\nSouq is an eCommerce company that was founded in 2005 by Ronaldo Mouchawar.\n\nSouq operates the largest such platform in the Middle Eastern market, selling millions of products in consumer electronics, healthcare, fashion, and homewares.\n\nSouq became an Amazon subsidiary in March 2017 in a deal worth $580 million in cash.\n\nThe acquisition allowed Amazon to further its intentions to become a global leader in eCommerce.\n\nIt also allowed the company to establish itself in a new and rapidly growing market, with only 2% of consumers in the Middle East purchasing online at that point.\n\nZoox\n\nZoox is an Amazon subsidiary that produces autonomous vehicles in the form of robot-taxis for mobility-as-a-service (Maas).\n\nThe company was originally founded by Australian designer Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levison – son of Apple chairman Arthur – who was creating self-driving technology whilst studying at Stanford University.\n\nZoox is a relatively recent addition to the Amazon family, having only been purchased in June 2020 for around $1.2 billion.\n\nThe acquisition was seen as a way for Amazon to compete with Waymo, an autonomous vehicle project run by Google.\n\nAudible\n\nAudible is an online podcast and audiobook service that was founded in 1997 by Don Katz.\n\nThe company released a portable media player of the same name where users could download and store audiobooks from the official website.\n\nIn 2003, Audible became the sole provider of audiobooks for the Apple iTunes store.\n\nAudible was ultimately acquired by Amazon in 2008 for $300 million, allowing the company to add more than 80,000 audiobooks, newspapers, and magazines to its vast online library.\n\nOne Medical\n\nIn July 2022, Amazon announced it would be acquiring healthcare clinic chain One Medical in an all-cash transaction worth approximately $3.9 billion.\n\nThe eCommerce behemoth outbid pharmacy chain CVS Health who put an offer forward a few months prior.\n\nThe One Medical acquisition enabled Amazon to expand its reach into healthcare alongside Amazon Care, a provider of virtual and in-home care services to individuals as well as other companies.\n\nWith Amazon Care and One Medical under its umbrella, the move was framed as a broader objective to reinvent the healthcare system.\n\nAt present, customers are required to book an appointment, wait for weeks or even months to be seen, secure time off work, and then often wait for hours before spending just a few minutes in front of the doctor.\n\nIn the press release announcing the deal, SVP of Amazon Health Services Neil Lindsay explained that the current system was ripe for disruption with a human-centered and technology-powered approach.\n\n“We see lots of opportunity to both improve the quality of the experience and give people back valuable time in their days,” he explained.\n\nIt was hoped that an increase in efficiency would also make the healthcare system more affordable, accessible, and even enjoyable for both patients and healthcare providers.\n\niRobot\n\nAmazon also announced it would be acquiring consumer robot company iRobot in August 2022 for around $1.7 billion.\n\nHowever, the deal is currently subject to FTC approval with the federal body raising antitrust concerns.\n\nAlmost immediately after the deal was announced, organizations such as Color of Change and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters voiced their concerns in an open letter.\n\nChief among these concerns was the potential for Amazon to collect private data from the Roomba vacuum cleaner about the layout of customers’ homes or their particular lifestyles.\n\nThe coalition of two dozen organizations was also fearful that the deal would enable Amazon to obtain a monopoly in the home tech sector.\n\nThey posited that Amazon could sell the Roomba at a loss and force other operators (without Amazon’s trove of data) out of the market.\n\nOne month later, in September, the FTC made a second request which CNN called “an indicator of deeper scrutiny by antitrust officials.”\n\nSome see the interest and involvement of the FTC as part of a renewed focus on Big Tech monopolies, with chairwoman Lina Khan having a history of targeting the practices of Apple, Google, and Meta.\n\nMore than one year earlier in July 2021, however, Amazon filed a motion to the FTC noting that Khan’s previous criticism of Amazon made her too biased to deal with the company fairly. “A reasonable observer would conclude that she no longer can consider the company’s antitrust defenses with an open mind,” part of the motion said.\n\nDespite Amazon’s best efforts, Khan remains chairperson of the FTC and more recently has been involved in scrutinizing Microsoft’s intention to acquire Activision Blizzard.\n\nWoot\n\nWoot is an American eCommerce company that was founded by entrepreneur Matt Rutledge. Woot was launched in 2004 as a daily deal site where Rutledge offered one product per day at a heavily discounted price.\n\nWoot experienced four years of rapid growth between 2004 and 2008 and was subsequently acquired by Amazon in 2010 for a reported $110 million.\n\nRutledge retained his role as CEO, but under Amazon’s ownership, Woot’s simple business model became more complex. Primarily, the platform moved away from the deal-of-the-day approach and instead featured a broader assortment of discounts.\n\nRing\n\nRing is a smart home and home security company that manufactures surveillance products. Ring started life as Doorbot in 2013 and was founded by Jamie Siminoff.\n\nWhen Siminioff pitched his idea on an episode of TV series Shark Tank, investor and consumer interest in the company grew and it was later rebranded.\n\nAmazon purchased Ring in 2018 for around $1 billion but had previously invested in the company via its investment arm Alexa Fund.\n\nThe purchase was part of the company’s wider move into home security after partnering with lock manufacturers Yale and Kwikset for in-home delivery service Amazon Key.\n\nAmazon Studios\n\nAmazon Studios is the company’s television and film production subsidiary that was started in the latter half of 2010. Produced content is shown in streaming service Amazon Prime Video and also in cinemas.\n\nAmazon studios started by developing movies and television shows from online submissions and crowd-sourced feedback.\n\nThe company had received around 10,000 submissions by late 2012 and users were paid various amounts according to whether scripts were accepted for development or made into full-budget films.\n\nIn April 2018, however, the company announced it would no longer accept screenplay submissions. Three years later, parent company Amazon acquired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in a multi-billion dollar deal.\n\nAmazon Pharmacy\n\nAmazon Pharmacy is a relatively recent addition to Amazon’s portfolio of subsidiaries. It was launched in November 2020 to offer prescription medication delivery to customers in the United States.\n\nAmazon Pharmacy allows customers to order medication online and have it delivered to their doorstep.\n\nPrime members can access free, two-day home delivery but are required to create a secure pharmacy profile that details their medical and insurance information.\n\nThe service is frequently described as a disruptor in the retail pharmacy sector. Indeed, on the day it was launched, competitor drugstores, distributors, and health insurers lost a combined $22 billion in market value.\n\nBook Depository\n\nBook Depository is an online bookseller based in the UK that was founded in 2004 by Andrew Crawford and Stuart Felton.\n\nThe company specializes in offering a wide range of titles and has become popular with consumers for its extensive catalog, competitive prices, and free worldwide delivery.\n\nAmazon acquired Book Depository in 2011 for an undisclosed sum. At the time, there were concerns over the company’s dominance in the UK market with the acquisition enabling it to become a near-monopoly bookseller.\n\nToday, Book Depository continues to operate as a separate entity.\n\nPillPack\n\nPillPack is an online pharmacy that was founded in 2013 by TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen.\n\nThe two pharmacists, who had previously worked together at a pharmacy in New Hampshire, saw an opportunity to simplify the medication management process for people who take multiple medications, vitamins, and other health products.\n\nAmazon acquired PillPack for $753 million in 2018 in a bid to snatch market share from established players such as Walgreens and CVS.\n\nMGM Holdings\n\nFounded in 2005, MGM Holdings is the parent company of content producer and distributor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The product of a Sony-led consortium, MGM Holdings acquired MGM in a leveraged buyout worth $8.4 billion.\n\nAs early as December 2020, MGM started to explore a potential sale of its studio after the pandemic and the proliferation of streaming platforms reduced cinema ticket sales. Amazon started talks to acquire the company in May 2021 and intended to continue operation of the studio and its assets under a new entity.\n\nThe eCommerce company completed its $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Holdings in March 2022.\n\nAs part of the announcement, senior Amazon VP Mike Hopkins noted that “We welcome MGM employees, creators, and talent to Prime Video and Amazon Studios, and we look forward to working together to create even more opportunities to deliver quality storytelling to our customers.”\n\nWondery\n\nWondery is a podcast network that was launched in 2016 by Hernan Lopez – a former Fox International Channels CEO who received financial backing from 20th Century Fox. Wondery is primarily focused on mobile users and audio-on-demand.\n\nAfter three years, the network entered the top five podcast publishers with 40 million users added in December 2018 alone. Several of its podcasts have also been adapted for television, such as Dirty John, Dr. Death, and The Shrink Next Door.\n\nAmazon announced on December 31, 2020, that Wondery would be joining Amazon Music. The company noted that the deal would enable the platform to offer more than simply music as listener habits evolved.\n\nThe acquisition price was not disclosed, but some estimated Wondery was worth at least $300 million at the time.\n\nAmazon Lab126\n\nLab126 is a computer hardware and R&D company that was started in 2004 by Gregg Zehr, an engineer and former employee at Palm and Apple. The name “Lab126” was chosen because the number 1-2-6 spells out “Lab” on a telephone keypad.\n\nLab126 has always been under the Amazon stable and has made numerous important contributions to Amazon products over the years. These include:\n\nAmazon Kindle – released after three years of development in 2007.\n\nKindle Fire Tablet – with the two subsequent models Kindle Fire HD and Fire HDX.\n\nAmazon Fire TV – launched in 2014.\n\nAmazon Echo – the voice command device debuted in 2015.\n\nThe Amazon Go chain of convenience stores, and\n\nAmazon Astro – a home robot developed by Lab126 for home security monitoring and remote care of the elderly, among other applications.\n\nToday, this subsidiary is a key part of Amazon’s innovation efforts as it continues to develop new products that aim to make customers’ lives easier and more enjoyable.\n\nHistory of Amazon with Brad Store\n\nKey takeaways\n\nAmazon has many known subsidiaries thanks to a culture of mergers and acquisitions that started in the late 1990s. Perhaps its most high-profile acquisition was Whole Food Markets in 2017 for $13 billion.\n\nAmazon also owns video live streaming service Twitch and eCommerce company Souq, the largest such platform in the Middle East.\n\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include audiobook platform Audible and autonomous vehicle company Zoox.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nAudible: Acquired in 2008, Audible is a leading provider of audiobooks and spoken-word content, enhancing Amazon’s digital media portfolio.\n\nIMDb (Internet Movie Database): Acquired in 1998, IMDb is a comprehensive online database for movies, TV shows, and celebrities, enriching Amazon’s content discovery offerings.\n\nZappos: Acquired in 2009, Zappos is an online shoe and clothing retailer known for exceptional customer service, adding a specialized e-commerce brand to Amazon’s portfolio.\n\nTwitch: Acquired in 2014, Twitch is a leading live streaming platform for gamers and content creators, expanding Amazon’s presence in the digital entertainment industry.\n\nWhole Foods Market: Acquired in 2017 for over $13 billion, Whole Foods Market is a well-known grocery chain emphasizing organic and natural products, marking Amazon’s entry into the grocery industry and physical retail space.\n\nWhich companies are owned by Amazon?\n\nAmazon owns hundreds of private labels, among which some are branded under the Amazon Basic umbrella. In addition, Amazon acquired AbeBooks.com, Audible, CamiXology, Fabric.com, IMDb, PillPack, Shopbop, Souq.com, Twitch, Whole Foods Market, Woot!, and Zappos.\n\nWho owns most of Amazon?\n\nJeff Bezos is the primary owner of Amazon. With 64,588,418 shares, Jeff Bezos is the primary individual investor. Bezos owns 12.7% of the company.\n\nDoes Jeff Bezos own all of Amazon?\n\nAs of 2021, Bezos owned 12.7% of Amazon. It’s critical to understand that over the years, Amazon took various venture capital investments, and as a listed company, part of the ownership is public. Thus, Bezos retained a significant stake in Amazon, valued at over $100 billion.\n\nRelated to Amazon Business Model\n\nAmazon Business Model\n\nAmazon Mission Statement\n\nCustomer Obsession\n\nWho Owns Amazon\n\nAmazon Revenues\n\nAmazon Profitability\n\nAmazon AWS Business\n\nAmazon Prime Revenue\n\nAmazon Advertising Revenue\n\nAmazon Cash Conversion\n\nWorking Backwards\n\nAmazon Flywheel\n\nJeff Bezos Day One\n\nRegret Minimization Framework\n\nNetwork Effects\n\nPlatform Business Model\n\nJeff Bezos Empire\n\nAmazon Subsidiaries\n\nRead next:\n\nAmazon Business Model\n\nWhat Is the Receivables Turnover Ratio?
