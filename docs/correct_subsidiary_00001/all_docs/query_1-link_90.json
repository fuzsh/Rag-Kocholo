        "text": "Amazon has confirmed that Rufus – the company’s latest AI chatbot – is now available for all US customers.\n\nPowered by generative AI (GenAI), the virtual shopping assistant will answer questions on shopping needs, products, and comparisons, which the company believes will help customers “save time and make more informed purchase decisions.”\n\nThe tool will be incorporated into Amazon’s customer portals, providing access to the complete product catalog, customer reviews, and community Q&As.\n\nPreviously announced back in February, the current iteration of the assistant is still only available in beta for US app users and cannot be accessed via the web version at this time.\n\nIn an unauthored blog on Amazon’s website, the company praises Rufus’ widespread impact so far:\n\n“Since introducing Rufus, we’ve been thrilled to hear directly from customers how Rufus has helped them with broad-range and specific shopping questions, and everything in between.\n\nCustomers have already asked Rufus tens of millions of questions, and we’ve appreciated their feedback so far.\n\nSo, let’s take a closer look at some Rufus’ capabilities and the types of queries that the solution is assisting customers with.\n\nSay Hello to Rufus\n\nWith the likes of Alexa and Siri having already established themselves as major players in the virtual assistant space, Rufus will need to differentiate itself to compete with its contemporaries.\n\nIn Amazon’s official statement about the expanded availability of the solution, it discussed some of the queries that Rufus has been handling so far, with the following proving most popular:\n\nUnderstanding product details and hearing what other customers say\n\nGetting product recommendations\n\nComparing options\n\nGetting the latest product updates\n\nAccessing current and past orders\n\nAnswering questions not obviously related to shopping\n\nIn essence, Rufus aims to enhance the shopper experience by consolidating research and purchasing into one platform.\n\nShoppers often struggle to choose the best product, whether for a hobby, event, or ethical reasons. Instead of sifting through numerous web results, users can ask questions directly in the app, such as “What are clean beauty products?” or “What do I need for cold weather golf?”\n\nRufus will then suggest product categories, provide helpful information, and share related questions from other shoppers.\n\nBeyond simplifying product filtering, Rufus also offers niche recommendations like ‘What should I buy my boyfriend for his 30th?’ as well as allowing customers to ask specific product questions, such as ‘Is this jacket machine washable?’ or ‘Is this cordless drill easy to hold?’\n\nUsing data from customer reviews and Q&As, Rufus provides accurate answers and suggestions.\n\nWith Rufus, Amazon aims to offer a comprehensive end-to-end shopping experience, leveraging extensive customer data and feedback alongside a GenAI-powered assistant to support users throughout their entire shopping journey.\n\nMore News from Amazon and AWS\n\nAnnounced earlier this month, Amazon Connect secured a significant deal when it was chosen to be Samsung’s new contact center provider.\n\nThe South Korean tech provider decided to switch CCaaS providers following issues with its previous hybrid solution, which included incomplete reports, missing metadata, limited AI voice options, and inflexible routing.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on cloud technology and the rapid pace of CCaaS innovation, Samsung collaborated with long-standing partner Teleperformance to find a new provider, with AWS’ flexible pricing model proving to be a major factor in the decision.\n\nDuring the selection process, Samsung evaluated three potential CCaaS providers but found some vendors’ traditional pricing models lacking in transparency regarding functionality and costs.\n\nElsewhere, in more Amazon Connect news, AWS has introduced a new step-by-step guide feature for its agent copilot on the CCaaS platform.\n\nNamed Amazon Q, this assistant now provides real-time recommendations based on specific customer queries by analyzing live interactions.\n\nIt identifies customer intent and proactively offers relevant guides to the agents, aiming to reduce handling times, improve first-contact resolution rates, and enhance customer satisfaction."
