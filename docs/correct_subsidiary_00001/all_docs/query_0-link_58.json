The present study has been done by using webometric methods. The top 20 Nigeria Universities websites were taken for assessment. Each University website was searched in Alexa databank and relevant data including links, pages viewed, speed, bounce percentage, time on site, search percentage, traffic rank, and percentage of Nigerian/foreign users were collected and these data were tabulated and analysed using Microsoft Excel worksheet. The results of this study reveal that Adekunle Ajasin University has the highest number of links and Ladoke Akintola University of Technology with the highest number of average pages viewed by users per day. Covenant University has the highest traffic rank in Nigeria while University of Lagos has the highest traffic rank globally. The fastest downloading speed and highest number of foreign users goes to University of Benin. Bayero University, Kwara State University and University of Uyo have the highest percentage of Nigeria users. Lagos State University with the highest estimated daily time spent on site by the visitors and lowest bounce percentage. The highest percentage of visits that came from search engines is for University of Agriculture, Abeokuta. Based on these research findings, recommendations were therefore made.",
