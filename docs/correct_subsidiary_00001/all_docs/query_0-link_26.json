        "text": "By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nEATTLE -- A subsidiary of online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. is under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission and is the subject of two lawsuits over its use of private customer data.\n\nDigital Privacy\n\nRelated Articles\n\nOngoing Coverage of Digital Privacy\n\nForum\n\nCan Privacy Be Protected Online?\n\nIn a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Amazon.com said the FTC was engaged in an \"informal\" investigation of Alexa Internet and its software, which tracks where users go on the World Wide Web in order to provide related Web links and other data.\n\nThe FTC would not comment on its investigation.\n\nThe two lawsuits mentioned in the SEC filing allege that Alexa's software, which is downloaded and installed on Web browsers like Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, secretly intercepts personal data and sends that information to third parties, including Alexa's parent company, Amazon.com.\n\n\"We are cooperating completely with the FTC on an informal, voluntary basis,\" said Alexa spokeswoman Dia Cheney. \"As for the lawsuits, we believe the claims have no merit.\"\n\nComputer security consultant Richard Smith, who found the possible privacy problems in Alexa's software, said the privacy concern is in the way Alexa tracks Web pages in order to provide related links. The system records the entire address of each Web page. On some Web sites, those addresses could contain customer data.\n\n\"Some (Web addresses) may contain personal information such as mailing addresses or customer account numbers,\" the Brookline, Mass.-based Smith said. \"It's conceivable that someone like Alexa could tie it all together with your surfing patterns and create a profile.\"\n\nThe lawsuits allege that the San Francisco-based Alexa is doing that -- combining information gleaned from Web addresses with Amazon.com's customer accounts. Both companies deny the charges. Alexa would not identify where the suits were filed.\n\nCheney noted that Web usage patterns and customers' data are stored in separate databases and are not linked.\n\nBoth Amazon and Alexa said Tuesday that personal data that Alexa gathers remains on Alexa's databases and is not made available to Amazon.\n\nAmazon.com has a service it calls \"zBubbles,\" which offers Alexa users the ability to buy certain products based on Internet sites they visit. For example, someone visiting a site about a handheld computer might click on a zBubble to get more information on how to buy the device from Amazon.\n\nHowever, the zBubbles do not access Amazon.com accounts or take such information from the users' computer, according to the company.\n\n\"This is not transactional information,\" said Amazon spokesman Bill Curry. \"This is a service that Alexa has on its product. It doesn't funnel into us.\"\n\nInvestors seemed unperturbed by the events, pushing Amazon up $7.81 1/4 to $82.81 1/4 at 4 p.m. in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market."
