        "text": "Alexa is by far the most popular digital voice assistant right now, which isn’t too surprising given that Amazon commands around 70 percent of the voice-enabled smart speaker market.\n\nBut what does that have to do with your startup? While Alexa is good at ordering diapers on demand or queuing up your music playlist, it can also do wonders for your startup business.\n\nLet’s go back a bit, shall we?\n\nWhen the first generation of Alexa devices was launched in 2014, beyond the original consumer rush to buying the latest fad, much of the business world completely ignored them. Or, worse, some laughed at them.\n\nAlexa devices and the associated skills were often shunned as chatbots that simply automate functions we already had on our smartphones — listening to the news, checking the time, or looking up recipes.\n\nFive years later, no one's laughing. And it looks like everyone wants a slice of the Alexa market. Take the state of California, for instance. It now has a skill for tourism which allows visitors to get tips on what local towns, attractions, and cities to visit within the state.\n\nThere’s a myriad of other Alexa skills making great things happen.\n\nYou can now use an Alexa skill to learn whether a flight is on schedule. In Europe, over 20 percent of doctors use Alexa for patient care. Plus, banks let users check their balance and transaction history via Alexa, as well as make purchases on the platform. Even thermostats have Alexa skills built in.\n\nAmazon announced Alexa has become HIPAA compliant as early as 2019. What’s more, at the latest Consumer Electronics Show (CES) event in Vegas back in January, there were over 300 different devices that announced they’ve incorporated Alexa in their latest design.\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, Alexa is having a moment. But whereas some companies have caught up with the trend, and even capitalized on them, others — especially startups — are failing to understand the power of voice assistants.\n\nThis article will explain the top Alexa skill considerations that startups should look into when building a product. We've also included a step-by-step guide on how to build a skill.\n\nThe state of the smart assistant industry\n\nThe smart speaker industry was worth around $2.68 billion in 2018 and is forecast to be valued at $11.79 billion by 2023.\n\nToday, voice-activated digital assistants are now a dime a dozen, with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana dominating the market.\n\nDid you know that there were some 2.5 billion smart voice assistants in use at the beginning of 2019? Analysts at Juniper Research say that this number will grow threefold to 8 billion assistants by 2023.\n\nWhile smartphone assistants like Google Assistant and Siri take the lion's share when it comes to volume ranks, smart speaker assistants aren’t far behind.\n\nIn fact, 90.1 million adult Americans say they have used a smartphone voice assistant monthly, compared with 41.5 million for smart speaker assistants. An additional 77.1 million US drivers say they use digital voice assistants in their cars at least once per month.\n\nThe latest report by Edison Research and NPR shows that there are close to 120 million smart speakers in the United States alone, a major uptick of 42 percent from a year ago. What’s interesting is that more than half of the owners have at least two smart speakers in their households and 52 percent of US adults use their smart speakers on a daily basis.\n\nAmazon has recently confirmed that it has sold more than 100 million Alexa-enabled devices worldwide. When it comes to voice assistant apps, China is where the action is. Chinese digital giants like Alibaba and WeChat are now offering app-based assistants alongside traditional smart speakers like Amazon Echo. That being said, it’s anticipated that 78 percent of all app-based smart assistants will be installed in China.\n\nOf more importance to startups, there’s one area smart assistants are making inroads into business: voice search. In fact, voice searches are expected to account for more than 50 percent of all digital searches by 2020.\n\nIn 2018, 56 percent of consumers used smart voice assistants at least once to look for a product, service or business info via search, with 46 percent saying they used it daily, according to Forbes. Overall, users say they prefer voice search for its ease of use and effectiveness. That being said, Alexa is arguably the biggest player in the smart assistant market.\n\n[bctt tweet=\"In 2018, 56 percent of consumers used smart voice assistants at least once to look for a product, service or business info via search.\" via=\"no\"]\n\nBottom line: In the home, consumers are using it to take interactions to the next level. Alexa is also helping businesses, particularly startups, to enhance their daily operations, collect early feedback, and to deliver next-level customer service.\n\nGetting to know Alexa, Alexa skills and Alexa for Business\n\nWhat is Alexa?\n\nAlexa is Amazon’s digital assistant that’s powered by voice recognition technology. This technology leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to convert speech into text or other functions. In the past five years or so, Alexa has established itself as the leader in the smart assistant space.\n\nAlexa “resides” in Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, the Tap, Fire TV and an array of third-party smart speakers. And it can do just about anything, from playing your favorite songs to grocery shopping. What's more, Alexa can control a plethora of smart devices in homes, offices or in cars.\n\nConsumers love Alexa for its ability to make everything hands-free. They love it so much so that 65 percent of Alexa users say they cannot imagine going back to life without the digital assistant. But, what makes Alexa so powerful and capable? Short answer: Alexa skills.\n\nWhat is an Alexa Skill?\n\nRight out of the box, Alexa comes with a wide range of built-in commands. For instance, Alexa’s capabilities include turning lights on and off, checking local weather forecasts, playing Spotify music, and answering several different questions.\n\nThese capabilities built into Alexa are what are called skills.\n\nYou can think of Alexa skills as voice-based apps that you can download and install in your smart speaker. They are designed to extend the features or capabilities of Alexa. As of the end of 2018, there were over 70,000 skills available from the Alexa Skills Store (the equivalent of the Amazon App store) and other 3rd-party developers.\n\nAlexa skills are so popular among consumers because they can do things fast and with a high-level of accuracy. Skills enable consumers to play trivia games, listen to radio channels, find out how certain stocks are performing, get news updates, and much more.\n\nAnd just like with a dog, you can teach Alexa new tricks or skills. The Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) by Amazon lets you build new custom Alexa skills and make them available to everyone or only a specific group of users. Your startup can create a private skill that’s only available to your employees and partners. This brings us to the next point: Alexa for Business.\n\nWhat is Alexa for Business?\n\nAlexa for business, also known as private skills allow companies to build skills not available on the public marketplace. In other words, not directed at consumers.\n\nLast year, Amazon made the technology behind Alexa available to businesses, companies, and developers who are interested in building their own set of private skills and solutions. The platform that makes this possible is called Alexa for Business.\n\nPart of the popular AWS (Amazon Web Services), Alexa for Business is a service that can enable startups to boost productivity, streamline product pipelines, automate processes, and overall harness the true potential of Alexa.\n\nHow do you go about building an Alexa skill?\n\nLet’s take a look at both the upsides and downsides of building a custom Alexa skill:\n\nThe pros\n\nAs an entrepreneur, you know how crucial it is to get things done quickly. That’s where creating Alexa skills for your startup comes in handy. This service allows you to bring Alexa and its capabilities to your workplace. If implemented correctly, it can do wonders for many aspects of your startup or your clients 'needs, from communication to management and event control.\n\nStreamline your meetings — Alexa can help you schedule meetings more efficiently and stay on top of your video conferences. Your employees can reserve meeting rooms and book conference halls using voice.\n\nYou can get a handle on your emails and other mission-critical communications. With Alexa for Business, you can read, organize or reply to emails in a heartbeat.\n\nMonitor your website, products, and services — Alexa can help track and provide status updates as well as reports about your site downtimes, product availability and more.\n\nDocument organization — Most employees, including startup staff, say they waste over four hours each week trying to find files. Alexa could take this load off their shoulders.\n\nImprove employee productivity by setting reminders, tracking your to-do lists, organizing emails, and many other operations in between.\n\nThe cons\n\nAmazon’s closed system for deploying Alexa skill is rather frustrating, to say the least.\n\nAs an AWS service, any cloud issues can impact on the effectiveness of your skill.\n\nSecurity and data privacy are still major hurdles to full adoption even in the workplace.\n\nHow to build an Alexa Skill — A quick guide\n\nEvery Alexa skill is made of two crucial components:\n\n1) Skill interface, which is the same as an application’s user interface (UI). It receives user’s verbal requests (what you speak), processes them using voice recognition tech and then matches them with predefined intents (what the user wants the smart speaker to do). Intents can be invoked by a sentence, phrase, or word. Eventually, the skill interface will create a line called JSON encoded event.\n\n2) Skill service, whose job is to figure out what action the smart speaker should do. It receives the encoded message from the interface, determines the proper response, and sends it to the user via a smart speaker.\n\nWhen you create a skill, you are building both components — the skill interface and the service.\n\nStep 1. Sign Up for Amazon Developer Service (ADS) and AWS accounts\n\nThe skill service will be implemented in the AWS environment. So, you’ll need to create a new AWS account, if you don’t have one already. Similarly, the skill interface will be created within the ADS platform.\n\nStep 2. Start building\n\nSign into your ADS account, click on Alexa. Next, choose “Alexa Skills Kit” and then click on the “Start a Skill” button under ASK. You will be taken to the new Alexa Skills Kit developer console. From here select “Create a new skill.”\n\nStep 3. Create an interaction skill model\n\nThe interaction model comprises the intents, invocation name, and utterances, etc of your skill. You can find all these components from the console tabs.\n\nStep 4. Pick the endpoints\n\nOnce your model is ready, you will have to choose the endpoints which determine if the skill is an AWS service or a user-implemented one. More often than not, your private skill will be an AWS service. If this is the case, choose the “AWS Lambda Function” under the “Endpoints” tab.\n\nStep 5. Create AWS Lambda functions\n\nThere are three Lambda functions that you need to define. They all coincide with the three kinds of intents/requests: LaunchRequest, IntentRequest, and SessionEndedRequest. They perform different actions, so ensure these functions are well-defined.\n\nStep 6. Test your new skill\n\nYou can test your new customer Alexa skill in two ways. First, you can use the Service Simulator that’s found under the Configuration tab. Once in the simulator mode, enter a typical utterance for your skill and see if it’ll invoke your skill. Secondly, you will have to take your skill for a test-drive on an actual Amazon Echo.\n\nStep 7. Review, customize, repeat\n\nIf you anything is amiss, customize the Alexa skill further, and then go back to testing. Repeat until your skill does what it is supposed to do best.\n\nOf course, there’s plenty of technical steps you need to take in between to create a robust Alexa skill. If you don’t have the right set of development skills, you might want to outsource to a digital agency like Digital Authority Partners.\n\nWhat’s the timeline and budget to build an Alexa Skill?\n\nBuilding an Alexa Skill — The timeline\n\nAny startup can build a private skill and submit it to Amazon to be approved, just like a mobile app. The timeline can range from a few hours to several weeks or even months, depending on the developer’s experience, how complicated the skill is, and the approval process. A flash briefing skill, for instance, can be created in a matter of an hour.\n\nYou can speed up the skill approval period by:\n\nEnsuring your invocation name is in line with Amazon requirements. It should work perfectly well with the smart speaker and Alexa.\n\nModeling the three example phrases precisely like the interactive model’s sample utterance.\n\nMaking sure that your skill doesn’t infringe on any existing IP requirements.\n\nProviding clear and concise help instructions when requested by the user.\n\nManaging sessions properly - you should make sure to define when and if sessions are open or timed.\n\nBudget — The cost of creating an Alexa Skill\n\nIt’s Amazon’s number one goal to boost the number of skills on their Alexa platform. They have slashed several costs involved in a bid to keep people using their Echos and other Amazon smart speakers.\n\nTalking of budgeting, Amazon allows developers to create custom Alexa skills for free. However, you will have to foot the bill of hosting your skill either on your own server or using AWS.\n\nThe cost to host change from skill to skill, depending on at least two factors: (1) how complex your Alexa skill is, and (2) the popularity of the skill.\n\nThe good news is that Amazon has announced plans to subsidize the cost of hosting a skill on AWS. As a startup, you can get a one-off $100 promotional credit. If you think your skill will attract other AWS fees, you can apply for an additional $100 every month. Unless your skills are designed to handle complex functions, the 100 bucks should be more than enough to cover all your costs.\n\nIn a nutshell, the cost of creating and hosting an AWS-hosted Alexa skill will be virtually nothing once you apply for Amazon credit. However, you might have to pay a professional developer to create an awesome and functional skill for you.\n\nWhat are the biggest industries adopting Alexa Skills?\n\nIn this section, I will cover industries that are benefiting the most, some use cases and existing skills.\n\n(A) Alexa for healthcare\n\nAmazon has a vested and clear interest in the healthcare sector.

In this section, I will talk briefly about what the future holds for Alexa and where I see the market in the future.\n\nAlexa as a friend\n\nAmazon has recently announced that Alexa will soon have a brain. In other words, Alexa will remember what you did and how you interacted with it in the past. It’s not far fetched to eventually see Alexa as a friend. Not just someone you can converse with, but also someone who remembers.\n\nHalf a year after launch, more than 500,000 people were already saying “Alexa, I love you.” Just imagine how attached people will become to Alexa when it has a brain!\n\nDeath of smartphones and traditional mobile apps?\n\nWith the current capability of Alexa, it is not hard to imagine a scenario where we are shifting away from smartphones and apps to a UI-less voice interface.\n\nI think we are inching closer to the reality depicted in the Her, the 2013 sci-fi film that featured Joaquin Phoenix and Amy Adams. Just like in the movie, Alexa’s replacing smartphone apps because everything becomes one question away.\n\nCars will have Alexa even more so than today\n\nCars will fuel the next Alexa revolution and with good reason.

Alexa just sounds better and more natural in a car. It won’t be too surprising if the homes and cars of the future will “talk” to each other via Alexa.\n\nAlexa is (and will continue) redefining marketing and advertising\n\nWith Alexa advertising, it’s easy to know who has and who hasn’t “seen” a particular ad. This makes it easy for marketers and advertisers to learn more about their target audience and tailor their ads for them. Besides, Alexa and other smart assistants are influencing the future of voice SEO.\n\nDigital businesses now have to switch from short-tail keywords to questions, create voice-friendly content, and focus on local search in order to be found via Alexa. After all, 30 percent of all searches will be done with smart speakers instead of screens by 2020, according to research by Gartner.\n\nFaster speed to market & more experimentation\n\nGetting a startup off the ground can take time and cost oodles of money, not to mention that 9 out of 10 startups fail. Now, imagine building Alexa skills to test a startup way before you build a website or an app. With an Alexa skill, it will take only a fraction of the cost to design, build, test, and bring it to the market!\n\nConclusion\n\nAlexa for business is here to stay, and startups can stand to benefit the most.\n\nWhile creating an Alexa skill has its challenges, it can help both veteran and new entrepreneurs manage their staff better, stay organized, cut costs, boost productivity, get early user feedback, and take their products to market at a fraction of the cost."
