        "text": "As someone who dreams in spreadsheets, I like to be in control. There's not much I can do when my car breaks down or my kid gets sick, so I like to take control of what I can -- when and where to fix the car and what systems to put in place with a sick child.\n\nMany apps are available for scheduling and sharing calendars, but not quite what I'm looking for. The good ones cost money, which I'm happy to pay when it's a great product. Still, all the ones I've tried are missing something, whether it's a sharing capability, integration with other systems, or a good user experience.\n\nAlso: Everything we're expecting at Amazon's Devices and Services event\n\nWithout a good app to help, I've dedicated an entire wall over our drop zone to family organization. This is where I keep the family calendar, school calendars and announcements, Post-its for reminders, and our kids' artwork. But wouldn't it be great to condense all this information into one screen or an app?\n\nThe Echo Show 15 caught my attention for this purpose as soon as it launched. A 15-inch screen with digital sticky notes and a built-in virtual assistant certainly sounds like it could do the job. But the only thing preventing me from dropping $250 on an Echo Show 15 is that I'm already familiar with the Echo Show platform -- and it's not great.\n\nAn Echo Show has the potential to become an all-in-one solution for busy families and professionals alike. But it's frustrating how limited the Echo Show's capabilities are.\n\nI love my Echo Show 8 -- it's become my assistant and companion in the kitchen to play music, stream shows, search recipes, check order status, create shopping lists, discover news and weather, and more.\n\nBut it's a shame that you can't customize it like you can with other tablets. And even if you can synchronize your calendar from Google, Apple, and Microsoft, you can't set up your Echo Show to always display the calendar without returning to its standby mode.\n\nThe Amazon Alexa app is also very slow and hard to navigate because it's not built intuitively. Some settings are hard to find, which is a shame, as many features go unused simply because users don't know they're there.\n\nOf course, several other online stores and websites sell a display for this purpose, but in the past few years since I've had kids and researched this solution, I've seen many companies that do this rise and fall. Please don't blame me for not wanting to be the victim of an ephemeral enterprise who ends up stuck with a $500 bricked screen in my home.\n\nAlso: Amazon's Echo Show 5 made me a smart display believer (and my daughter, too)\n\nThough I am married to one, I'm not a developer. And we don't have spare time to figure out this conundrum on our own, which is why I've been searching for a turnkey solution for so long.\n\nIf Amazon improved its Echo Show experience, or even made the Echo Show 15 more of a customizable \"family center\", I'd buy it faster than I can add a budgeting spreadsheet to a shared drive. And my satisfaction is not just about being able to create proprietary calendar apps with fancy tags or a budgeting application -- I just want a way to have the fullscreen calendar be an option when the Echo Show goes into standby mode.\n\nRight now, the Echo Show doesn't allow a customizable home screen, but the Echo Show 15 does, the problem is that it doesn't let you set the calendar as the default home screen. However, the 15 model is the only Echo Show to allow widgets, so you can add the calendar as a widget (along with sticky notes or any other available options) to reside in your home screen. If you do, dyou should probably turn off Auto-Sleep in your settings so the display doesn't go to sleep. The largest calendar widget takes up about a third of your screen."
