        "text": "Everything about Amazon in 2019 is inconceivably big: Amazon will make up an estimated 38% of the US e-commerce market this year, according to the online commerce research firm eMarketer, and already dominates 67% of the online books, music, and video market; 46% of the online computer and electronics market; 45% of the online toy market; and 34% of online furniture sales. And with more than $25 billion in revenue just from Amazon Web Services last year, Amazon is the world’s largest cloud services provider.\n\nIts sheer size and influence has caught the attention of regulators and lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who proposed a plan to break up Amazon and other technology companies in March. In its defense, Amazon said it makes up just 4% of all US retail sales.\n\nBut taken as a whole, Amazon is much more than a retail platform. The company — which originally incorporated on July 5, 1994, under the business name “Cadabra” and started selling books under the new name Amazon on July 16, 1995 — has expanded into a complex web of businesses and subsidiaries that make it easy to walk into and difficult to walk out of. Its reach stretches from review sites like Goodreads to shoe sales on Zappos to devices like Ring to baby clothing sold in its marketplace to educational tools for teachers, like entire math curriculums.\n\nFew corners of business are untouched by Amazon. You might be shopping on an Amazon-owned site even if you don’t think you are, or be looking at a website or using an app that uses one of many of Amazon’s web services.\n\nWe compiled this list of all Amazon’s businesses, brands and subsidiaries in honor of the company’s anniversary. In addition to the countless companies Amazon has acquired and services it has launched, we found Amazon has more than 80 private-label brands across all categories, including a dozen women’s clothing brands and (inexplicably) seven denim brands, showing how the company has expanded quietly, but at an aggressive pace. Quartz reported that Amazon has either been awarded or applied for 800 trademarks.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive (the company is pretty hush-hush about its businesses), some of the listed businesses here have been discontinued or absorbed into other services on the list, and there were lots of questions about how to categorize certain things. So the list is imperfect, but the point is: there are hundreds of products, brands, and services that Amazon offers that often don’t even use the Amazon name. Take a look at what’s already crossed our radar — this is just the surface, and surely there are many more to come.\n\nAPPAREL AND ACCESSORIES\n\n7Goals\n\nAn Amazon brand of women’s activewear.\n\n28 Palms\n\nAn Amazon brand of men’s floral-print button-ups and polo shirts.\n\n206 Collective\n\nAn Amazon brand of leather-based men’s and women’s shoes.\n\nA for Awesome\n\nAn Amazon brand of children’s clothing.\n\nAmazon Essentials An Amazon brand that offers men’s and women’s basics.\n\nArabella An Amazon womenswear brand including bras, shapewear, and sleepwear.\n\nBody Labs\n\nAmazon acquired the 3D body model startup in 2017.
