        "text": "From April 18-20, Amalgam Insights attended Cloud Foundry Summit 2018 in our hometown of Boston, MA. Both Research Fellow Tom Petrocelli and Founder Hyoun Park attended as we explored the current positioning of Cloud Foundry as an application development platform in light of the ever-changing world of technology. The timing of Cloud Foundry Summit this year coincided with Pivotal’s IPO, which made this Summit especially interesting. Through our attendance of keynote sessions, panels, and the analyst program, we took away several key lessons.\n\nFirst, the conflict between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes is disappearing as each solution has found its rightful place in the DevOps world. My colleague Tom Petrocelli goes into more detail in explaining how the perceived conflict between Cloud Foundry’s initial containerization efforts and Kubernetes is not justified. This summit made very clear that Cloud Foundry is a very practical solution focused on supporting enterprise-grade applications that abstracts both infrastructure and scale. Amalgam takes the stance that this conflict in software abstraction should never have been there in the first place. Practitioners have been creating an artificial conflict that the technology solutions are seeking to clarify and ameliorate.\n\nAt the event, Cloud Foundry also announced heavy-hitting partners. Alibaba Cloud is now a Gold member of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. With this announcement, Cloud Foundry goes to China and joins the fastest growing cloud in the world. This announcement mirrors Red Hat’s announcement of Alibaba becoming an Red Hat Certified Cloud and Service Provider last October and leads to an interesting showdown in China as developers choose between Cloud Foundry and OpenStack to build China’s future of software.\n\nIn addition, Cloud Foundry Foundation announced Cloud.gov as the 8th certified provider of Cloud Foundry. This step forward will allow federal agencies to use a certified and FedRAMP Authorized Cloud Foundry platform. The importance of this announcement was emphasized in an Air Force-led session on Project Kessel Run, which is focused on agile software for the Air Force. This session showed how how Cloud Foundry accelerated the ability to execute in an environment where the average project took over 8 years to complete due to challenges such as the need to ask for Congressional approval on a yearly basis. By using Cloud Foundry, the Air Force has identified opportunities to build applications in a couple of months and get these tools directly to soldiers to create culture that is #AgileAF (which obviously stands for “Agile Air Force”). The role of Cloud Foundry is accelerating one of the most challenging and governed application development environments in the world accentuated the value of Cloud Foundry in effectively enabling the vaunted goal of digital transformation.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the announcement that really grabbed our attention was the demonstration of cfdev in providing a full Cloud Foundry development experience on a local laptop or workstation on native hypervisors. This will make adoption far easier for developers seeking to quickly develop and debut applications as well as to help developers build test and sandbox environments for Cloud Foundry.\n\nOverall, this event demonstrated the evolution of Cloud Foundry. The themes of Cloud Foundry as both a government enabler and the move to China were front and center throughout this event. Combined with the Pivotal IPO and Cloud Foundry’s ability to work with Kubernetes, it is hard to deny Cloud Foundry’s progress as an enterprise and global solution for application development acceleration and in working as a partner with other appropriate technologies.\n\nMy name is Lynne Baer, and I’ll be covering the world of data science software for Amalgam Insights. I’ll investigate data science platforms and apps to solve the puzzle of getting the right tools to the right people and organizations.\n\n“Data science” is on the tip of every executive’s tongue right now. The idea that new business initiatives (and improvements to existing ones) can be found in the data a company is already collecting is compelling. Perhaps your organization has already dipped its toes in the data discovery and analysis waters – your employees may be managing your company’s data in Informatica, or performing statistical analysis in Statistica, or experimenting with Tableau to transform data into visualizations.\n\nBut what is a Data Science Platform? Right now, if you’re looking to buy software for your company to do data science-related tasks, it’s difficult to know which applications will actually suit your needs. Do you already have a data workflow you’d like to build on, or are you looking to the structure of an end-to-end platform to set your data science initiative up for success? How do you coordinate a team of data scientists to take better advantages of existing resources they’ve already created? Do you have coders in-house already who can work with a platform designed for people writing in Python, R, Scala, Julia? Are there more user-friendly tools out there your company can use if you don’t? What do you do if some of your data requires tighter security protocols around it? Or if some of your data models themselves are proprietary and/or confidential?\n\nAll of these questions are part and parcel of the big one: How can companies tell what makes a good data science platform for their needs before investing time and money? Are traditional enterprise software vendors like IBM, Microsoft, SAP, SAS dependable in this space? What about companies like Alteryx, H2O.ai, KNIME, RapidMiner? Other popular platforms under consideration should also include Anaconda, Angoss (recently acquired by Datawatch), Domino, Databricks, Dataiku, MapR, Mathworks, Teradata, TIBCO. And then there’s new startups like Sentenai, focused on streaming sensor data, and slightly more established companies like Cloudera looking to expand from their existing offerings.\n\nOver the next several months, I’ll be digging deeply to answer these questions, speaking with vendors, users, and investors in the data science market. I would love to speak with you, and I look forward to continuing this discussion. And if you’ll be at Alteryx Inspire in June, I’ll see you there.\n\nOver the past two weeks, I’ve been to two conferences that are run by an open source community. The first was the CloudFoundry Summit in Boston followed by KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe 2018 in Copenhagen. At both, I found passionate and vibrant communities of sysops, developers, and companies. For those unfamiliar with CloudFoundry and Kubernetes, they are open source technologies that abstract software infrastructure to make it easier for developers and sysops to deliver applications more quickly.\n\nBoth serve similar communities and have a generally similar goal. There is some overlap – CloudFoundry has its own container and container orchestration capability – but the two technologies are mostly complementary. It is possible, for example, to deploy CloudFoundry as a Kubernetes cluster and use CloudFoundry to deploy Kubernetes. I met with IT professionals that are doing one or both of these. The same is true for OpenStack and CloudFoundry (and Kubernetes for that matter). OpenStack is used to abstract the hardware infrastructure, in effect creating a cloud within a data center. It is a tool used by sysops to provision hardware as easily scalable resources, creating a private cloud. So, like CloudFoundry does for software, OpenStack helps to manage resources more easily so that a sysop doesn’t have to do everything by hand. CloudFoundry and OpenStack are clearly complementary. Sysops use OpenStack to create resources in the form of a private cloud; developers then use CloudFoundry to pull together private and public cloud resources into a platform they deploy applications to. Kubernetes can be found in any of those places.\n\nFake News, Fake Controversies\n\nWhy then, is there this constant tension between the communities and adopters of these technologies? It’s as if carpenters had hammer people and saw people who argued over which was better. According to my carpenter friends, they don’t. The foundations and vendors avoid this type of talk, but these kinds of discussions are happening at the practitioner and contributor level all the time. During KubeCon+CloudnativeCon Europe 2018, I saw a number of tweets that, in essence, said: “Why is Cloud Foundry Executive Director Abby Kearns speaking at KubeCon?” They questioned what one had to do with the other. Why not question what peanut butter and jelly have to do with each other?\n\nSince each of these open source projects (and the products based on them) have a different place in a modern hybrid cloud infrastructure, how is it that very smart people are being so short-sighted? Clearly, there is a problem in these communities that limit their point of view. One theory lies in what it takes to proselytize these projects within an organization and wider community. To put it succinctly, to get corporate buy-in and widespread adoption, community members have to become strongly focused on their specific project. So focused, that some put on blinders and can no longer see the big picture. In fact, in order to sell the world on something that seems radical at first, you trade real vision for tunnel vision.\n\nPeople become invested in what they do and that’s good for these type of community developed technologies. They require a commitment to a project that can’t be driven by any one company and may not pan out. It turns toxic when the separate communities become so ensconced in their own little corner of the tech world that they can’t see the big picture. The very nature of these projects defies an overriding authority that demands the everyone get along, so they don’t always.\n\nIt’s time to get some perspective, to see the big picture. We have an embarrassment of technology abstraction riches. It’s time to look up from individual projects and see the wider world. Your organizations will love you for it.\n\nStanding in the main expo hall of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe 2018 in Copenhagen, the richness of the Kubernetes ecosystem is readily apparent. There are booths everywhere, addressing all the infrastructure needs for an enterprise cluster. There are meetings everywhere for the open source projects that make up the Kubernetes and Cloud Native base of technology. The keynotes are full. What was a 500-person conference in 2012 is now, 6 years later, a 4300-person conference even though it’s not in one of the hotbeds of American technology such as San Francisco or New York City.\n\nWhat is amazing is how much Kubernetes has grown in such a short amount of time. It was only a little more than a year ago that Docker released its Kubernetes competitor called Swarm. While Swarm still exists, Docker also supports, and arguably is betting the future, on Kubernetes.\n\nKubernetes came out of Google, but that doesn’t really explain why it expanded like the early universe after the Big Bang. Google is not the market leader in the cloud space – it’s one of the top vendors but not the top vendor – and wouldn’t have provided enough market pull to drive the Kubernetes engine this hot. Google is also not a major enterprise infrastructure software vendor the way IBM, Microsoft, or even Red Hat and Canonical are.\n\nKubernetes benefited from the first mover effect. They were early into the market with container orchestration, were fully open source, and had a large amount of testing in Google’s own environment. Docker Swarm, on the other hand, was too closely tied to Docker, the company, to appease the open source gods.\n\nNow, Kubernetes finds itself like a new college graduate. It’s all grown up but needs to prepare for the real world. The basics are all in place and it’s mature but there is an enormous amount of refinement and holes that need to be filled in for it to be a common part of every enterprise software infrastructure. KubeCon+CloudNativeCon shows that this is well underway. The focus now is on security, monitoring, network improvement, and scalability. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of concern about stability or basic functionality.\n\nKubernetes has eaten the container world and didn’t get indigestion. That’s rare and wonderful.\n\nIndustry: Software Asset Management\n\nKey Stakeholders: CIO, CFO, Chief Digital Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Mobility Officer, IT Asset Directors and Managers, Procurement Directors and Managers, Accounting Directors and Managers\n\nWhy It Matters: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is now a strategic IT component. As enterprise SaaS doubles in market size over the next three years, this complex spend category will continue to expand beyond the ability to manually manage it\n\nTop Takeaways: With this acquisition, ServiceNow will have a cutting-edge & converged Software Asset Management solution for both SaaS and on-premises applications in 2019. Enterprise organizations managing over $25,000 a month should consider an enterprise SaaS vendor management solution to optimize licenses, de-duplicate vendor categories, and gain enterprise-grade governance.\n\nWith ServiceNow’s acquisition of VendorHawk, the era of SaaS Vendor Management is emergent.\n\nServiceNow Acquires VendorHawk\n\nOn April 25th, 2018, ServiceNow announced its acquisition of SaaS Vendor Management solution VendorHawk in an all-cash transaction scheduled to close in April. This acquisition highlights the increasingly strategic role of SaaS from an IT service management perspective and validates the need for Software Asset Management solutions to support SaaS. In addition, this acquisition continues a string of acquisitions that ServiceNow has made over the past year including acquisitions of:\n\n• Qlue, an artificial intelligence framework for customer service\n\n• Telepathy, a design firm focused on massive adoption of applications\n\n• SkyGiraffe, a no-code mobile app development platform used to make all ServiceNow applications mobile-friendly\n\nThe VendorHawk acquisition falls in line with these acquisitions in that VendorHawk will help enterprises to support the widespread adoption of SaaS.\n\nContinue reading Market Milestone: ServiceNow Buys VendorHawk and SaaS Management Comes of Age"
