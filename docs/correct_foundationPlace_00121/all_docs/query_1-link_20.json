        "text": "For the remainder of this section, we will refer to exact algorithms as optimization. We make this distinction because any approach designed to find the best answer (optimization) must use a computational algorithm based on a proven scientific technique. An approach designed just to find a good answer (heuristics) does not require the same mathematical proof. For some heuristics, it’s impossible to know if it can provide the best answer.\n\nBy definition, a prescriptive analytics solution must rely on rules or optimization. It’s possible but less uncommon for a prescriptive analytics solution to use both simultaneously. One approach isn’t always better than another; rather, business leaders and analysts need to understand when to apply each type (or when to apply both).\n\nCRITERIA TO CONSIDER WHEN DETERMINING THE BEST APPROACH TO PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS:\n\nTYPE: Some problems are naturally better for heuristics, while others are better for optimization. There are lists below citing examples of each.\n\nCOMPLEXITY: How difficult is the problem? There are well-known problems — e.g., traveling salesman — that can be difficult to find the best answer using optimization. In some cases, finding a good solution quickly using rules might make sense compared with optimization.\n\nPERFORMANCE: How long are you willing to wait for an answer each time you solve the problem? If an answer must be found as soon as possible, a heuristic might be a better choice. If time is not a major concern, optimization might be a better choice.\n\nFREQUENCY: How often must the problem be solved? If a new decision must be made frequently, maybe hundreds, even thousands, of times each day, then heuristics is likely to be a better choice over optimization.\n\nHEURISTICS (RULES)\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nHeuristics are a set of problem-dependent rules. They are best used when the problem can be narrowly defined and operational in nature, rather than tactical or strategic. Additionally, they can be a good choice when the same decisions must be made by hundreds, thousands, even millions of times per day.\n\nHeuristics use highly specialized techniques designed to take advantage of particular aspects of a problem. They typically require developing either a set of mathematical functions (e.g., f(x) = y); a set of instructions (e.g., “If this… then do this”); or both. Here is an analogy:\n\nImagine you are driving in a car in a city you don’t know, trying to reach a destination that you have never been to. The only instructions you have been given are “head west until you reach a certain hill on the horizon.” You begin driving…\n\nWithout GPS, a map, or a specific set of instructions, you must rely on a rules-based approach — knowledge of local traffic laws plus intuition and experience — to help guide you. You might not take the shortest route (in distance or time). You might end up driving an extra 10 kilometers and take 20 minutes longer than was necessary. You might not get to your destination at all without additional information. This approach is a good proxy for a heuristic. Since a GPS system can provide the best answer based on an exact algorithm with specified parameters (i.e., “I want the shortest distance”), it would meet the test of an optimized approach.\n\nExcel is a common tool used to make business decisions. By using features like IF statements, lookups, and functions, Excel-based rules can be defined by making a hypothesis about a potential answer. Then, when values are entered, the answer is immediately returned. Unless an optimization approach is used, there are no means to know if this is the best answer.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nAs mentioned above, certain decisions are better suited to heuristics rather than optimization.\n\nExamples of circumstances where optimization is not required and “rules of thumb” are sufficient:\n\nRAW MATERIAL PURCHASES: e.g., purchase the cheapest source of raw material first regardless of quality\n\nCAPACITY ALLOCATION: e.g., assign capacity to line 1 first, then line 2 second, and so on, regardless of operating efficiency or costs\n\nMARKETING: e.g., offer customers promotional opportunities based on a website search or prior purchase\n\nDEMAND FULFILLMENT: e.g., Tier 1 customers must always have their service level met at the expense of lower tier customers\n\nPROS\n\nBetter for decision automation, because it provides an instant output\n\nBetter for difficult problems, such as scheduling or inventory economic order quantity (EOQ)\n\nCan be easier to learn, configure, and implement — many rules-based decisions are built into existing features in business process management (BPM), inventory management, and other software\n\nCONS\n\nLimited benefits for holistic decision-making across functions (e.g., Integrated Business Planning) with a low ROI\n\nHighly likely forfeiture of additional profits (or fewer costs)\n\n“Good enough” answers are not guaranteed optimal (and often no mathematical proof)\n\nWon’t analyze every possible scenario\n\nAlthough rare, it can fail to find a good solution if instructions don’t allow it\n\nRequires customized solutions for narrowly-defined, specific problems\n\nMay result in infeasible plans, for example, using Excel for tactical or strategic decision making\n\nRules are difficult to maintain or may become obsolete\n\nOPTIMIZATION\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nOptimization is a combination of mathematical modeling and exact algorithms used to find the optimal answer. A problem is defined by writing math equations using a model building platform. Once the model is created, it is sent to a highly specialized algorithm used to solve the problem. More information is provided later on\n\nAn optimization problem consists of the following parts:\n\nDECISIONS TO BE SOLVED FOR\n\nCommonly referred to as decision variables\n\nThese are the business questions to be answered. Complex problems can range from 100K to 10 million+ individual decisions.\n\nExamples\n\nHow much raw material to purchase?\n\nHow many hours to run each line?\n\nHow much product to sell to certain markets?\n\nDATA TO BE INPUT\n\nCommonly referred to as coefficients\n\nDepending on the problem can be costs, prices, BOMs, or yields\n\nThe shorter the planning period, the more granular the data should be\n\nExamples\n\nHow much does each ton of raw material cost?\n\nWhat does it cost to run each line?\n\nWhat is the recipe for SKU #123 at Plant A?\n\nAt what price is the product sold in each market?\n\nBUSINESS REALITIES/RESTRICTIONS THAT MUST BE ADHERED TO\n\nCommonly referred to as constraints or bounds\n\nThese can include but are not limited to physical laws or company policies\n\nExamples\n\nHow much is raw material available to purchase?\n\nHow many hours does each line have available?\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of demand for each market?\n\nTo achieve an optimal answer, an objective must be stated to either maximize or minimize a metric (e.g., profit, costs, personnel utilization, volume). The user can specify how precise they want the answer and how long they are willing to wait. The optimization algorithm then finds the best answer.\n\nSAMPLE PROBLEMS OPTIMIZATION ADDRESSES\n\nOptimization is used to solve numerous problems that are generally too complex for a heuristics-based approach.\n\nHistorically, problems solved using optimization were for a specific business function:\n\nTRANSPORTATION: shipping goods from supply to demand points at a minimal cost\n\nEQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT: determining the optimum point in time to replace equipment\n\nASSIGNMENT PROBLEMS: assigning staff to equipment\n\nGASOLINE BLENDING: for aviation fuels\n\nOver the last two decades, businesses have learned to use optimization to tackle cross-functional problems. Some of the less traditional yet significantly more valuable applications are:\n\nCustomer profitability and pricing\n\nAsset investment planning\n\nProduct mix, blending, and substitution\n\nTreatment path optimization\n\nWorkforce planning and training\n\nCommodity trading\n\nFurther on in this book, we dive into sample applications of optimization across four different industries.\n\nPROS\n\nProvides an optimal answer with opportunity values\n\nGreat for making complex decisions and yields better insights and higher feasibility\n\nProven techniques established many decades ago\n\nEstablished software industry for building and solving models\n\nCONS\n\nChallenging problems can take significant time to find the best answer.\n\nOlder generation software packages require specialized knowledge to write math equations.\n\nIn the old days, people saw optimization as a black box as equations were difficult to manage.\n\nSELECTING THE RIGHT APPROACH\n\nIn this chapter, we provided brief descriptions of heuristics versus optimization. We also cited a few examples for each approach as well as pros and cons. There are many things to consider when making a choice:\n\nWhatever approach and technology you choose, it must allow for flexibility to do what-if scenario analyses.\n\nAs you read through the pages, try to envision what you will ask of it.\n\nConsider not just your current decisions, no matter how critical they are, but all possible important decisions you might need to make in future years.\n\nLook for approaches and technologies that allow for a great deal of flexibility in both model scope and in changes over time.\n\nWhether rules or optimization-based, there are two primary technology approaches for prescriptive analytics: packaged applications and optimization platforms.\n\nA packaged application is a fully functional program developed by the vendor that requires an installation or subscription plus configuration, but no additional coding. The answers provided can be either rules or optimization- based. Some configuration can be required, such as choosing which components or modules are installed. Sometimes, you can customize parts of packaged applications to meet specific requirements.\n\nSoftware companies with packaged applications in the prescriptive analytics marketplace sell targeted solutions focused on well-defined business areas. The vendor has decided ahead of time what problem you want to solve, what data you need, what reports you want to see, and so on. Llamasoft’s Supply Chain Guru, which focuses on network optimization and JDA’s Manufacturing Planning solutions, are two such examples.\n\nAn optimization platform is used to create applications and requires customization. Most platforms still run in Windows or Linux and require a license. Whereas a packaged application might be marketed explicitly for inventory management, an optimization platform can allow you the ability to create your own applications for inventory, capacity, demand, and various other uses.\n\nPlatform software can require you to create the math. Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System (AIMMS) and IBM’s CPLEX Optimization Studio are two such programs. Other software, such as River Logic’s Enterprise Optimizer, have a drag and drop visual user interface, where you draw a picture to define the problem.\n\nBoth optimization-based packaged applications and platforms rely on highly specialized algorithms, called optimization solvers, to find answers. IBM’s CPLEX, Gurobi, and FICO’s Xpress are examples of market leading solvers. In a packaged application, the use of a solver might not be visible in the user interface. For this reason, we include the discussion of solvers below with optimization platforms, since all platforms must interact with solvers explicitly.\n\nThe figure below highlights the difference between the two approaches. The two boxes on the left comprise some of the vendors who sell optimization modeling platforms and solvers. The box on the right lists a few primary business-related subject areas served by packaged application software.\n\nFigure 3. Optimization solvers, platforms and applications (Gartner, 2017)\n\nAs you read the following pages, keep in mind that modeling platforms and solvers are used to create applications, whereas the packaged applications are programs where the software vendors have already done most of the work for you. The best choice for you depends on many criteria. In the following pages, we explore in-depth the fundamental differences as well as provide examples, pros, and cons of each option.\n\nPACKAGED APPLICATIONS\n\nDEFINING A PACKAGED PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS APPLICATION\n\nUpon seeing a packaged application, you should be able to quickly and easily understand what the product is (i.e., which problem does it solve), how you would use it, and what kind of output analysis you should expect.\n\nSince the prescriptive analytics market for packaged applications is relatively new, most are cloud-based. Major advantages of software-as-a-service (SaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS), include only paying for the hardware and software that you consume and having the software installed and maintained by the vendor. Typically, customers have immediate access to the latest release. Implementation time from kickoff to user acceptance should be measurable in days or weeks, not months or years.\n\nMost knowledge transfer from a vendor or consultant to your organization should occur through established training programs, either in an online knowledge base, within the product itself or in a classroom. Ideally, there are example models and other documentation that resemble your company’s issues.\n\nOnly a “reasonable” amount of configuration, integration, training, and support should be necessary to start. Configuration can include setting up user accounts and defining master data. Integration can also include using vendor provided templates and doing whatever work is necessary to upload data files.\n\nSome applications allow for direct connections to other data sources needed for data input (i.e., ETL using Microsoft SSIS) and to other programs dependent on the output for analysis (e.g., BI tools like Microsoft Power BI). This can be an issue if your organization doesn’t allow data outside your company’s firewall.\n\nIf it appears to require a high degree of customization, including writing math equations, it probably does not meet the definition of a packaged application. A packaged application using optimization will never require a user to write math. Consequently, vendors of packaged applications will rarely make their proprietary code available to customers. Sometimes, potential customers decide that they don’t like the “black box” aspect of packaged software, but it can work quite well because each customer directly benefits from all other customer’s experience.\n\nPACKAGED SOLUTIONS ON THE MARKET TODAY\n\nThis list includes applications identified as meeting the criteria for packaged applications. We cannot guarantee; however, that is always true. What can appear as a relatively simple packaged application might require a substantial amount of effort to get working.\n\nAs for costs, most packaged technologies, especially web-based, require subscriptions to access the software. This is usually done per user or by the enterprise with each user’s access to features determined by the type of role they are assigned. Subscription fees can range from several hundred dollars per month, per user to millions of dollars per year, per enterprise license.\n\nMost web-based packaged applications to date are focused on consumer packaged goods and retailers, which is primarily due to companies having the necessary data and the real need to optimize their complete customer acquisition and retention strategy and operations:\n\nTable 4.

A modeling environment is a software used to write the mathematics needed to define the problem. This step can either be done by coding in a language or with a drag and drop user interface. Solvers are specialized software programs designed to provide an exact solution.\n\nDEFINING A MODELING PLATFORM\n\nA modeling platform software is used to define problems. It can require writing math equations or use a drag and drop visual interface. Program names typically contain words like developer, modeler, studio, toolbox, or similar variations of those. Most modeling software requires installation on computers running Windows or Linux operating systems. Licenses are frequently required, which can be tied to a specific user, machine, or for use by an organization. Established around 30 years ago, there are approximately 50 such products on the market today.\n\nDEFINING A SOLVER\n\nAn optimization solver is a software designed to solve problems using one or more exact algorithms. Problems defined in a modeling environment are combined with data and then input to a solver. The solver then uses various techniques to arrive at an answer. The quality of the solution is highly dependent on problem definition, data quality, and the user’s willingness to allow the solver to find the best possible answer.\n\nMODELING PLATFORMS AND SOLVERS ON THE MARKET TODAY\n\nThe costs of modeling software and commercial solvers vary greatly. Algebraic modeling software can range from free for trial/academic use to hundreds of thousands of dollars for enterprise licenses.commercial solvers can range from a few hundred dollars per machine on the low end; to millions of dollars per year for unlimited use across a large enterprise.\n\nWe have grouped all vendors into a single list, including free/open source and proprietary. Some vendors sell only modeling environments, some sell only commercial solvers, and some sell both:\n\nVENDOR DESCRIPTION WEBSITE Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System (AIMMS) Modeling language and development environment.

It is, therefore, important to articulate the needs not only for the first use case, but also more broadly to support a longer-term vision for how prescriptive analytics will support Planning and Decision Making needs. The key areas that should be considered include Modeling, User Interface, Data Management, and Architecture.\n\nMODELING\n\nThis section guides you on whether to use a modeling platform or a packaged application (which has a hard-coded model inside) and helps you understand what the platform/packaged application needs to support. Here are some questions that may help make the best determination:\n\nQUESTIONS TO CONSIDER\n\nCan the problem be expressed in the platform or application?\n\nPay close attention to the key constraints that must be respected to get a feasible/optimal outcome — especially if the solution requires ratios, blending, financial ratios, special ordered sets, or conditional minimums\n\nDoes the technology have the flexibility to support future changes in the business?\n\nCan it add new constraints and objectives? Pay close attention to the key constraints that must be respected to get a feasible/optimal outcome — especially if the solution requires ratios, blending, financial ratios, special ordered sets, or conditional minimums.\n\nHow well does the technology support financials as both inputs and outputs?\n\nMake sure the financial modeling includes the managerial side (i.e., financials modeled as incurred by the business, like fixed costs, variable cost/ unit, variable cost/hour, variable cost/customer, base revenue, revenue associated with discounts, etc.). Make sure it is also expressed in financial accounting terms, as many of the organization’s constraints and targets are reflected through P&L, Cash Flow statement, etc. (think of working capital, debt to equity ratios, net income as an objective, etc.)\n\nHow easy/fast is it for personnel to learn, configure and deploy models? Is it a visual, drag-and drop language or do you need to write/ manage thousands of equations? Does it require an Operations Research Ph.D. or can an astute business analyst handle it?\n\nNote that it is customary these days for prescriptive analytics technology to embed expert knowledge and be configurable in days/weeks by a business analyst. Try to avoid the situation where you become dependent on an expert modeler who is the only person able to edit/manage a “black box” model that contains thousands of equations\n\nIs error checking included out of the box, or does it need to be added in?\n\nThink of variable definitions, data gaps, material balances, financial auditing, etc. This can add significant work — as many as four to eight weeks — to the development of even a medium complexity model\n\nUSER INTERFACE (UI)\n\nIn 99% of the cases, there is more than one person who can/should interact with and benefit from the prescriptive analytics model. These users are normally business people who have multiple tasks and cannot devote too much time to using a “raw” model. Therefore, there is a need for them to interact with the model through an interface. Below are some key considerations for the interface:\n\nIS IT INTUITIVE AND EASY TO LEARN?\n\nDoes it support entering information and visualizing inputs? Think of identifying exceptions, spotting outliers, and entering information at different levels of aggregation (for example at an SKU/product/brand level).\n\nCan a user define, configure, and run optimization scenarios? Beyond simply running a scenario (say from the web), does it enable the right level of scenario management and collaboration? This may include running scenarios in private, sharing scenarios with colleagues, managing parent/child relationships, and simulating multiple scenarios.\n\nAre the reports capable of supporting the right visualization? Do they have a filtering capability? Can end users edit the reports? Can it be exported into Microsoft Office?\n\nIs the UI configurable or does it require programming to deploy?\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT\n\nThe prescriptive analytics model usually requires a significant amount of data, some of which needs to be cleaned up and approved before use. Key areas of focus include:\n\nDoes the platform have tools to bring data in? Can it transform the data for use? Can it run checks to identify missing data?\n\nDoes it support a proper workflow, where data comes in, a user reviews/edits it, another user approves it, etc.?\n\nIs the data available for use by other applications? Does the solution have APIs?\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nWhile IT professionals likely have an extensive list of checks, here we focus primarily on applying a business lens. As such, you might consider the following questions:\n\nIs the offering Cloud-based? And what would I need to install on premises, if anything occurs? If Cloud based, you would save time to install, require less knowledge to manage and reduce the hardware requirements. Plus — if the application is truly elastic — you will have more scalability. On the converse, make sure the vendor has set up the proper security levels.\n\nWhere will the data be stored? Is it in a standard database such as Microsoft’s Structured Query Language (SQL) Server, or does the vendor have a proprietary database that may create a longer-term dependency and risk? If the data is very sensitive, does the vendor support a hybrid model where the data can reside on-premises yet the organization can still benefit from Cloud-based features such as scalability and user interfaces?\n\nCONFIGURE OR OUTSOURCE?\n\nThe value from prescriptive analytics can be transformational, so delaying the initiative due to lack of resources may create too large an opportunity cost for the organization. The good news is that service providers (i.e., consultants) are increasingly investing in prescriptive analytics capabilities and they are a great source of talent to get an initiative launched.\n\nThe key considerations include personnel availability, skills, knowledge, cost, and risk. While personnel availability is straightforward, skills and knowledge are not always so. If you have a service provider with deep knowledge in Prescriptive, it may be better to have them help you even if over time you transition the project to internal resources. This approach may be more costly, but it can greatly enhance the knowledge in your organization while reducing the risk. Some service providers will also take “at risk” contracts where their upside is completely aligned with yours — this is a great way to maximize the return on that critical first project.\n\nFinally, consider analytics as a service offering from service providers. These services may include just the development and management of the models or can also include configuring, maintaining, and even running the full application. Service providers have deep expertise in making these systems work. Nevertheless, make sure that you have an opportunity to learn and that you can bring the capability into your organization at the right time.\n\nCONFIGURE YOUR OWN\n\nPROS\n\nYou can get exactly what you want\n\nAnswer performance and result can be highly tuned\n\nYour organization retains the knowledge\n\nYou work directly with software vendors, who often have specialized knowledge to help you get up and running fastest — remember their interest is in your adopting and getting value from the software\n\nCONS\n\nRequires a software subscription, although now with cloud vendors, there is a limited need for IT resources and installation\n\nYou might need to hire someone with specialized modeling skills depending on the software you choose\n\nIt may take you time to find the resources if they aren’t already in your organization\n\nOUTSOURCE\n\nPROS\n\nYou can get exactly what you want — depending on the service provider, it may require some education on the use case.\n\nA good service provider brings knowledge and best practices in the space.\n\nYour organization won’t need to hire the expertise directly, so you can potentially move faster.\n\nService providers are good at change management to help you adopt and receive value from the initiative.\n\nYou can onboard the resources from the service provider when you are ready to do so.\n\nCONS\n\nYou become reliant on another company’s expertise\n\nDespite claims of confidentiality and internal “Chinese walls,” there is a chance your unique knowledge will become part of industry best practices over time.\n\nIt may cost you more than using internal resources.\n\nCurrently, information and content in organizations and businesses are being digitized. We are collecting and converting increasingly more information and “raw” data in a digital format. This gives us the opportunity to apply analytical techniques to:\n\nIdentify the patterns of (business, organization, customer…) behavior; Big Data, IoT, Data Science\n\nLearn and understand the patterns of (business, organization, customer…) behavior; AI and ML\n\nPrescribe and optimize the patterns of (business, organization, customer…) behavior; prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML\n\nThis, in turn, will enable business and organizations to:\n\nImprove and optimize their existing operations\n\nIdentify and realize the best opportunities they have\n\nMACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nTo understand how the workplace may change, we can look at our current everyday environment, where we are becoming more and more reliant on ML and AI. Take the advanced driver assistance system that now comes standard in just about every new car: parking assistance, anti-collision assistance, and lane change monitoring assistance. These ML and AI systems aid the driver in all sorts of day-to-day situations making driving safer and easier. Fundamentally they help and supplement the decision-making of the driver.\n\nThe assistance in day-to-day decision-making is how we are and will see, ML and AI affecting the workplace more and more including the following examples:\n\nPRODUCT INTELLIGENCE\n\nIdentifying, presenting, and recommending relevant products\n\nQuicker, more informative product success/lack of success insights\n\nPredictive/preventative maintenance\n\nProduct success/failure diagnosis\n\nPERSONAL/CUSTOMER INTELLIGENCE\n\nLearning individual (customer) preferences and behavioral characteristics\n\nPredicting individual behavior and behavior\n\nPersonal/collective sentiment analysis\n\nIntelligent segment, cohort identification\n\nAUTOMATION\n\n“Smart” services, such as customer service, travel, buying, home/business automation\n\nFinancial fraud and identity detection and alerting\n\nLogistics processing\n\nMonitoring Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)\n\nHOW PRESCRIPTIVE FITS IN WITH EMERGING TRENDS\n\nThe above are example use cases that demonstrate how AI and ML are impacting organizations and businesses. The emergence of prescriptive analytics, harnessing AI and ML, to drive the best (optimized) decision- making across the breadth of an organization and business provides important, tangible value. Delivered on scalable cloud computing platforms means leading organizations and businesses are already utilizing prescriptive analytics and generating significant insights and value that have previously been out of reach.\n\nBut tension and concern exist with the potential impact of prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML for replacing jobs and roles in organizational processes. This tension and concern come down to the distinction between prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML for Process and Decision Automation compared with prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML for Augmented Decision Making. In this context, Process and Decision Automation is the potential replacement of human jobs and roles with technology, while Augmented Decision Making is about aiding people in decision making and making them more productive. There is an analogy for the AI/ML/decision automation that exists within self- driving car technology and the advanced driving assistance that are still used by human drivers. Although technically self-driving cars are advancing in their capability, the human concerns and acceptance of the user experience are significant and one of the major barriers to the rapid scale adoption.\n\nWhat the self-driving car will deliver is a (fundamental) change in the car driving experience. Likewise, the impact of prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML in the workplace will change the work experience and redefine the jobs and roles. In organizations and business, we will see the growing presence of Augmented Decision Making through more informed, prescriptive analytics that helps and guides decision-makers to examine and determine the best course of action. Focusing on prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML on use cases that add value to people’s capabilities and performance as well as process value is essential to successful organizational adoption.\n\nThe technological revolution that is underway will fundamentally change the way we live and work. AI and ML are already becoming more relevant in our day-to-day lives (beyond the driving assistance in cars). Alexa, Cortana, and Siri, as AI Assistants, are now commonly used and referred to. One important aspect of the AI Assistant adoption has been the User Experience (UX) developed to make them natural and normal to use.\n\nAdvancements in prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML need to make people’s jobs more productive and simpler from a UX perspective. The challenge for businesses in progressing prescriptive analytics is twofold:\n\nThe limitation of handcrafting (programming) prescriptive analytics, ML, and AI algorithms\n\nDeveloping a UX that encourages widespread adoption and usage above and beyond traditional enterprise software tools\n\nTHE LIMITATION OF HANDCRAFTING (PROGRAMMING)\n\nThe challenge for developing prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML is beyond writing the code. The scope requires fundamental integration of other subject matters including advanced mathematical concepts, sophisticated algorithms, and deep data analytics and learning. Developing prescriptive analytics from scratch (handcrafted coding) is time consuming and limiting.\n\nMoving forward, we are seeing the emergence of “smart” prescriptive analytics solutions that self-generate the complex algorithms and inject the domain expertise to overcome the human programming limitations. This approach enables non-technical, business and subject matter people to define and articulate the scope and application of prescriptive analytics. The need, therefore, is a UX approach that encourages and engages people in using prescriptive analytics systems. By exposing prescriptive analytics systems to more users, the system can learn and become more intelligent and smarter.\n\nDEVELOPING A UX THAT ENCOURAGES WIDESPREAD ADOPTION\n\nTo encourage and enable widespread adoption, a UX approach is needed that is distinct from the traditional enterprise software tool and personal productivity application where significant time and investment is needed for users to learn and be trained. The UX approach needs to be grounded in basic concepts:\n\nProduct design aesthetics that utilize visual, touch and voice interactions\n\nModern prescriptive application experience distinct from traditional software tool experience\n\nDevice ubiquity and preferences that support “always connected”\n\nWeb/Search immediacy — the simplest, quickest approach\n\nThrough these UX concepts, the prescriptive analytics experience enables:\n\nPeople to have up-to-date, prescriptive, relevant information in context without being overloaded with detail\n\nPeople to make more informed decisions sooner through the presentation of tailored, real-time, reality-based, and prescriptive information in social contexts in which they can collaborate\n\nPeople to have more realistic and relevant simulations tailored to the specific needs of the context they are in.\n\nConsequence analysis, i.e., decision making is improved through an understanding of the consequences of action based on current choices and information available\n\nTHE FUTURE IS POWERED BY PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS\n\nThe growth and adoption of prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML are being fueled by more scalable and powerful cloud computing. AI and Ml are proliferating the need for Big Data at an accelerated rate. The IoT is delivering more connected devices increasingly as sources of data.\n\nPrescriptive analytics demands more complex algorithms and mathematical modeling capabilities. Alongside the scaling of cloud computing, raw computing power is also increasing significantly. On the horizon is the advent of Exascale computing delivering over one exaflop (1 billion) calculations per second, over 50 times the performance of current 20 petaflop-capable systems that are now among the fastest in the world. Alongside increasing traditional computing power, the initial availability of commercial quantum computers is increasing. Both Exascale and quantum computing will add processing capabilities that will power prescriptive analytics, AI, and ML even more dramatically. More complex and wide-ranging prescriptive analytics will enable more and more interactions into real-time.\n\nPrescriptive analytics, AI, and ML will become more prominent in organizations and business. The augmentation of decision-making will enable optimal outcomes to be determined and scaled across the breadth and depth of organizations and will be explicitly tied into the overall business outcomes."
