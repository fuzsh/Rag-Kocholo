        "text": "You can call it the new oil, or even the new electricity, but however it is described, it’s clear that data is now recognized as an essential fuel flowing through organizations and enabling never before seen opportunities. However, data cannot simply be collected; it must be handled with care in order to fulfill the promise of faster, smarter decision making.\n\nMore than ever, it is critical to have the right tools for the job. Leading IT vendors are coming forward to help customers address the data-driven possibilities by improving self-service access, real-time insights, governance and security, collaboration, high availability, and more.\n\nTo help showcase these innovative products and services each year, Database Trends and Applications magazine looks for offerings that promise to help organizations derive greater benefit from their data, make decisions faster, and work smarter and more securely.\n\nThis year our list includes newer approaches leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation as well as products in more established categories such as relational and NoSQL database management, MultiValue, performance management, analytics, and data governance.\n\nOn the following pages, we present DBTA’s list of Trend-Setting Products for 2019. We encourage you to continue your exploration by visiting the companies’ websites for additional information.\n\nAnd, to stay on top of the latest news, IT trends, and research, go to www.dbta.com, and review Unisphere Research’s library of survey reports at www.unisphereresearch.com.\n\nIn addition, in this issue, we include “Product Spotlight” articles penned by company executives with explanations of what makes these products unique."
