Technology Builders App/System Builders Investors Consumers/Users Analytics/Insights as a Service Delivery is migrating to a service-oriented business model. “app store” models call for revenue sharing. Revenue/proﬁt splits need to reﬂect current value so contracts should allow for changes to reﬂect market conditions. For paid subscription sites, buyers may place a premium on owning/ licensing results with personally identiﬁable data, or simply want perpetual access to results. This will drive new business models. Investors are driving this movement - no speciﬁc action recommended. Pay as you go analytics and CC services will be a big market. The insights gained during operation hold real value, so capturing them for future engagements should be a strategic goal. Analytics as a Service Insights as a Service Business Trend:\n\n17.

Predictive analytics: the use of statistical algorithms and a set of assumptions - the model - to identify the likelihood of future outcomes or missing values based on patterns in historical data. Linear regression Logistic regression (categorical dependent variable) Time-series analysis Classification trees Decision trees… Historical Data Predicted Data Assumptions\n\n18.

Principle: The IOT creates high-value opportunities for low-latency applications. Example: Devices that can communicate with an individual (via mobile device, wearable, etc) can create value if they have the right information about the individual. From variable pricing of soda in a machine to suggesting a purchase to offering a discount if a customer walks past an item believed to be of interest, the applications need to be able to run the analytics in time to make a recommendation. Implication: Data needs to be close enough to process while the results are still valuable. Availability is critical.\n\n35. Theme III. Smart Data Management Copyright (c) 2016 by STORM Insights Inc.

Two Things Nobody Tells You About Data… • All data is structured Google used a neural network with16,000 processors to search 10,000,000 images from YouTube to identify…cats. • Beliefs change, truth doesn’t Representing belief as fact will eventually trip up any system “Facts change in regular and mathematically understandable ways.” Samuel Arbesman, The Half-life of Facts, 2012, Penguin Books.\n\n37.

Copyright (c) 2015 by STORM Insights Inc. All Rights reserved. Do you have a good candidate app? Start with the hard questions! Do you have the skills? Do you have the data? Are your customers ready for probabilistic or non-deterministic answers? (can they deal with uncertainty and multiple possible answers?) Does anybody else have the data? Will NLP add value in the eyes of your customers? How important is it to be able to explain how the system got an answer or made a recommendation…? (medical diagnosis - HIGH, recommending a sweater, not so much) How important is it for the system to improve its performance over time? (vs consistent answers)\n\n44.
