I've been interested with the Raspberry Pi ever since it was first shown to me back in my first semester hardware class. The first thing I noticed when receiving my Pi was the lack of documentation that came with it, and the difficulty of sifting through the official Raspberry Pi forums to find information on where and how to get started with the Raspberry Pi. Because of this I got together with the owner of the YouTube channel RaspberryPiivbeginners and Dylan Segna and together we sought out to create an online community of absolute Raspberry Pi beginners to come to and have a wealth of information of how to get started with the Pi available to them.\n\nJohn Breakey - CEO, Fivel Systems Inc\n\nJohn Breakey is a serial entrepreneur in the Information Technology industry.

(Honours Co-op Comp. Sci. 1977) from the University of Waterloo and a degree in theology (M. Div.

I recently have come to a conclusion that involvement in the \"open source\" movement(?)/community(?)/wave(?) is in large part an answer to this creative tension.\n\nI worked for nine years as a developer, technical support analyst and systems programmer in the 1970's and 1980's - leaving this career when computers could be taken home. Despite the change in vocations, computers have never been far from me, prompting one friend to describe me as a \"cyborg - in the most positive way of understanding that description!\"\n\nHere is a link to my blog on this subject: opensourcespiritseeker.wordpress.com\n\nTwitter handle: @pcchynoweth\n\nPresentations:\n\nThe Spirit of Open Source\n\nRajith Attapattu - Sr. Software Engineer, Red Hat Inc.\n\nI am a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat, working primarily with the MRG messaging team.
