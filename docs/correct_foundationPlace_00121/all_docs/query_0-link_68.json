        "text": "We have published the full-text of the Gold Stevie Award-winning entries from the 2014 (8th Annual) Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service, the world's premier sales awards and customer service awards.\n\nREAD THEM HERE.\n\nHere’s a preview of some of the Gold Stevie-winning entries you'll find online now:\n\nCompany: Strategy to Revenue, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom\n\nCategory: Sales Training or Coaching Program of the Year\n\nNomination Title: DHL Global Forwarding - Quest for Sales Excellence\n\nStrategy to Revenue (STR) was engaged by DHL Global Forwarding (DGF) in September 2012 to transform the global sales force to become the number one in the logistics industry as part of their 'Good to Great' business strategy.\n\nIn order to fully understand the current situation, STR worked in collaboration with the DHL Global Sales Training team to analyze the sales process, existing selling models and concepts used in the field, and identify the gaps to drive high performance...\n\nCompany: Kohl's Department Stores - Credit Divison, Menomonee Falls, WI\n\nCategory: Contact Center of the Year (Over 100 Seats) - All Other Industries\n\nNomination Title: The Kohl's Charge Contact CenterThe Kohl's Charge Contact Center\n\nThe Kohl’s Charge Contact Center, a 900+ seat environment with four locations, provides Retail & Customer Service and Operational Support to 25+ million Kohl’s Charge Card customers and 1,158 retail store locations. 3 balanced elements define the Kohl’s unique Contact Center Strategy…\n\nCompany: PostNet, Denver, CO\n\nCategory: Sales Growth Achievement of the Year\n\nNomination Title: PostNet\n\nPostNet CEO Steve Greenbaum, and co-founder Brian Spindel led PostNet’s re-imagined franchise model from its origins as a mail and parcel store to a full-on Neighborhood Business Center. When consumer sales declined in the recession, PostNet seized an opportunity in a new breed of customers: laid-off workers who decided to go into small business ownership. Validation of this new target customer came from extensive market research and an analysis of the top-performing franchises that were already mainly focused on servicing the needs of small businesses in their communities...\n\nCompany: Delta Air Lines, Atlanta, GA\n\nCategory: Front-Line Customer Service Professional of the Year Nomination Title: Rachel Bible, Dallas/Ft. Worth Customer Engagement Specialist\n\nChris Kyle, a United States Navy SEAL, known as the most lethal sniper in American military history, was tragically shot and killed on February 2, 2013 at a shooting range in Texas. To honor this war veteran, Mr. Greg Marra, known as America’s Sculptor, completed a life-size sculpted image of Chris Kyle and was raising funds to have it transported from Sarasota to Dallas/Ft. Worth, where it would be cast in bronze and eventually presented to Mr. Kyle’s family.\n\nBusiness partners of Mr. Marra contacted Delta to make flight reservations to attend a ceremony where the statue would be viewed. When Dallas/Ft. Worth Specialist Rachel Bible heard the story, she inquired if Mr. Marra also needed reservations. Rachel offered to conference in Mr. Marra to assist him but was told he wasn’t ready to make his reservation due to lack of funds. Rachel realized quickly that the flight had a limited number of seats left on it, and overwhelmed with compassion for the situation, elected to pay for Mr. Marra’s ticket herself...\n\nCompany: Turkish Economy Bank, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nCategory: Best Use of Technology in Customer Service\n\nNomination Title: TEB SME TV\n\nTEB SME TV is the first internet television of the banking sector in Turkey. The objectives are to help development and growth of SMEs in Turkey, to offer suggestions to expand their visions, to share success stories and growing trends in business. It presents these facilities by providing hot news on many topics including marketing & sales, foreign trade, information about industry, R & D incentives, meeting the SME’s needs of information and training focusing on the latest developments...\n\nCompany: CGS, New York, NY\n\nCategory: Contact Center Leader of the Year\n\nNomination Title: Tom Walsh, Executive Directory\n\nTom Walsh is an outstanding call center site director for CGS’s Edison, NJ call center, where he is responsible for the 170 person technical support help desk for a multinational photography and imaging company. Through thick and thin, he manages his people with enthusiasm and care while managing the business with attention to results. He thinks creatively and works within the constraints of a call center operation to constantly re-invent and improve...\n\nCompany: FreshBooks, Toronto, ON Canada\n\nCategory: Customer Service Management Team of the Year\n\nNomination Title: FreshBooks Management Team\n\nFreshBooks’ customer service management team consists of Senior Support Manager, Steve Bujouves and Support Managers, Grace Antonio and Tim Chan (lovingly known 'round these parts as Chim).\n\nThis past year presented a difficult challenge for the team. To meet the needs of a growing user base, the Support Team needed to double (yes, double!) its size this year to 22 people. The hardest thing to keep intact when growing the team so quickly is ensuring customers *consistently* receive extraordinary experiences every time they contact FreshBooks. The focus for 2013 was consistency...\n\nEntries for the 2015 edition of the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service will open in July.
