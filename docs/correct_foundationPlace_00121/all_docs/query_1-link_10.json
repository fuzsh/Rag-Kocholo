        "text": "Contact Us\n\nPhysical Address\n\nAccess Center\n\n1330 Truxtun Ave.\n\nBakersfield, CA 93301\n\n661-636-4100\n\nMailing Address\n\n1300 17th Street-City Centre\n\nBakersfield, CA 93301\n\nThe Kern County Superintendent of Schools Office recognizes that its employees are a valuable resource. There are great benefits to be realized from a workforce that is racially and culturally diversified; therefore, the Office operates on a merit system as part of its personnel management program. The merit system is designed to provide a fair and equitable personnel management program dedicated to the recruitment, retention, and development of employees on the basis of merit and job-related qualifications. It assures fair treatment of applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, gender, disability, medical condition, martial status, or sexual orientation, and with proper regard for the privacy and constitutional rights of citizens.\n\nThe Office is education related; however, the services provided touch a far larger segment of the community. As a public agency it holds a public trust, so the Office strives to maintain a high standard of accountability. The Kern County Superintendent of Schools Office places a strong focus on customer service and sensitivity towards staff, clients, and the public.\n\nHR Staff Directory\n\nCherie Payne, Assistant Superintendent – Human Resources P: 661-636-4747\n\nE: chpayne@kern.org Natalie Lucas, Administrative Secretary II to Cherie Payne P: 661-636-4673\n\nE: nalucas@kern.org Matthew Gutierrez, Director II Human Resources P: 661-636-4747\n\nE: magutierrez@kern.org Toni Dewing, Secretary II to Matthew Gutierrez P: 661-636-4747\n\nE: todewing@kern.org Michelle Rigby, Director I – Staff Development P: 661-636-4543\n\nE: mirigby@kern.org Rosenda Thomas, Human Resources Manager P: 661-636-4683\n\nE: rothomas@kern.org Andrew Lane, Human Resources Systems Analyst P: 661-636-4251\n\nE: anlane@kern.org Rodolfo Noriega, Human Resources Specialist P: 661-636-4692\n\nE: ronoriega@kern.org Courtney Perez, Fingerprint Technician\n\nFingerprint Appointments, Clearances, and Billing P: 661-636-4672\n\nE: coperez@kern.org\n\nCLASSIFIED\n\nTammy Garcia, Human Resources Technician III\n\nPersonnel (non-Credentialed) P: 661-636-4342\n\nE: tagarcia@kern.org Anisa Hernandez,, Human Resources Technician II\n\nJob Announcements, Testing & Interviews P: 661-636-4391\n\nE: ahernandez@kern.org Michelle Phillips, Human Resources Technician III\n\nPersonnel (non-Credentialed) P: 661-636-4697\n\nE: miphillips@kern.org Gloria Townsend,Human Resources Technician III, Leave Specialist (Classified & Certificated) P: 661-636-4749\n\nE: gltownsend@kern.org Taryn Jackson, Human Resources Technician I\n\nSubstitutes, Student Workers, and Professional Experts P: 661-636-4633\n\nE: tajackson@kern.org Rosa Alfaro, Human Resources Technician I P: 661-636-4405\n\nE: roalfaro@kern.org\n\nCERTIFICATED\n\nMollie Montgomery, Human Resources Technician III Personnel (Credentialed) P: 661-636-4752\n\nE: momontgomery@kern.org Maribel Polanco, Human Resources Assistant, Worker’s Compensation and Certificated P: 661-636-4782\n\nE: mapolanco@kern.org Evelyn Feliciano, Credentials Manager P: 661-636-4750\n\nE: evfeliciano@kern.org Gloria Perez, Credentials Analyst P: 661-636-4370\n\nE: glperez@kern.org Carrie Melton, Credentials Technician P: 661-636-4751\n\nE: camelton@kern.org Adrianna Pompa, Credential Technician P: 661-636-4197\n\nE: adpompa@kern.org\n\nPAYROLL\n\nVanessa Dhindsa, Employee Benefits Specialist P: 661-636-4612\n\nE: vadhindsa@kern.org Carie Pollick, Payroll Manager P: 661-636-4325\n\nE: cacerda@kern.org Erica Celedon, Senior Payroll Technician/Payroll A-F P: 661-636-4661\n\nE: erceledon@kern.org Ashley Pineda, Payroll Technician G-M P: 661-636-4661\n\nE: aspineda@kern.org Teresa Green, Payroll Technician N-Z P: 661-636-4667\n\nE: tegreen@kern.org\n\nTEACHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM"
