The ETI will promote and provide open-source solutions for election administrators to enhance the safety and transparency of U.S. and international elections as well as raise voter trust, accessibility, and participation. ElectionGuard, a piece of open-source software created by Microsoft's Democracy Forward Initiative, will be switched over to the ETI as the project's first step.
