New advances in neural network techniques have opened the doors to solving problems at scale that were out of reach until recently. Because of these advances, applications such as in image recognition for self-driving cars, medical image classification, text translation, and fake news detection are both tractable and often the industry standard. In this keynote, Mike Tamir, who heads the data science teams at Uber ATG—the self-driving cars division—reveals how two key application areas of deep learning signal the broad importance of this emerging technology.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nHead of Data Science, Advanced Technologies Group\n\nUber\n\n9:15 am\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nKEYNOTE\n\nData science, if judged as a separate science, exceeds its sisters in truth, breadth, and utility. DS finds truth better than any other science; the crisis in replicability of results in the sciences today is largely due to bad data analysis, performed by amateurs. As for breadth, a data scientist can contribute mightily to a new field with only minor cooperation from a domain expert, whereas the reverse is not so easy. And for utility, data science can fit empirical behavior to provide a useful model where good theory doesn’t yet exist. That is, it can predict “what” is likely even when “why” is beyond reach.\n\nBut only if we do it right! The most vital data scientist skill is recognizing analytic hazards. With that, we become indispensable.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nFounder & Chair\n\nElder Research\n\n9:40 am\n\n10:00 am\n\nExhibits & Morning Coffee Break\n\n10:30 am\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nOperationalizing predictive models\n\nThis PAW track – \"BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\" – is kicked off by James Taylor of Decision Management Solutions, an industry leader in the operationalization of predictive models.\n\nMany organizations still struggle to get a business return on their investment on advanced analytics. The biggest barrier? An inability to integrate analytics, especially predictive analytics, into frontline systems and business processes. Work with a number of global companies has revealed three critical success factors. By adopting a more decision-centric approach to analytics, changing the way requirements and business understanding are defined, and considering advanced analytics as one of a set of decision-making technologies, organizations can tie their analytics investments to business results and deliver the business value they are looking for.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nCEO\n\nDecision Management Solutions\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nTrack 2: WORKFORCE - Retaining & optimizing HR with analytics\n\nWorkforce optimization and retention\n\nDrawing on a unique database consisting of workforce (HRIS) data from multiple organizations, Mercer's Workforce Analytics team has applied predictive modeling to examine to what extent systematic differences exist between what millennials actually value in employment as compared to older employees. The results challenge \"popular press\" stereotypes about millennials at work. By identifying the predictive antecedents of employee turnover, i.e., what employees do, as opposed to relying on survey results, i.e., what millennials say they value, this research provides insight into actual behavior in a way that has practical relevance to the design of effective employee value propositions (EVPs) and total rewards.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeakers\n\nSenior Partner, Co-leader Mercer Workforce Sciences Institute\n\nMercer\n\nPrincipal, Workforce Strategy & Analytics\n\nMercer\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: CASE STUDIES - Manifold business applications of machine learning\n\nInfrastructure planning; telecom\n\n10:30 - 10:50 am\n\nCase Study: Charter Communications (Spectrum)\n\nCharter Communications (Spectrum) is the second largest cable service provider in the nation, and every investment to expand fiber network is based on maximizing the ROI. Charter makes an extensive use of Predictive Analytics based on Logistic Regression, Survival Analysis, GIS analysis to determine the best go-to prospects and assign sales territories to maximize return.\n\nThe marketing team has been able to improve campaigns' performance by over 30%, and the network construction team has been able to identify thousands of new buildings with the best ROI (with only 5% rejection rate) which were deemed unreasonable till now.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nDirector of Predictive Analytics\n\nCharter Communications\n\nTV ad targeting\n\n10:55 - 11:15 am\n\nCase Study: Turner\n\nTurner has developed a machine learning algorithm that is capable of predicting granular audience targets. This innovation, called Competitive Audience Estimation, enabled advertisers/agencies to buy and execute audience targeted marketing campaigns on linear TV. This talk will overview the methodology and attained results.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nSenior Vice President of Analytics, Data and Decision Sciences\n\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc.\n\n11:15 am\n\n5-minute transition between sessions\n\n11:20 am\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nOperationalizing analytics\n\n11:20 - 11:40 am\n\nCase Study: Northwestern Mutual\n\nGetting models and analytic products ‘over the line’ and implemented or operationalized can be challenging due to factors often outside the direct control of a modeling or analytics team. I’ll share some of the obstacles that we’ve met in our journey maturing as an Enterprise Data and Analytics organization. Some are business and organizational challenges, others are technology related. At Northwestern Mutual, we’ve successfully navigated a number of these challenges and deployed models and other analytic products for mission critical business functions. I’ll talk through some of the challenges and share our approach to overcoming them.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nVP - Analytics, Insights, and Data Science\n\nNorthwestern Mutual\n\nAnalytics management\n\n11:45 am - 12:05 pm\n\nCase Study: Quicken Loans\n\nData Science’s massive potential can only be unleashed if it’s aligned with, and empowered by, senior leadership in an organization. Even the most sophisticated, transformative and well-executed projects can be for naught if the right people don’t trust how it works, its value or haven’t developed a culture that values Data Science. But while senior leaders speak business, Data Science teams often speak in math or code, and increasingly do so as the field evolves. How can Data Science teams bridge this gap to elevate their place and impact within an organization? In this talk I will share the story of Quicken Loans’ Data Science team and how some simple but insightful best practices can build the trust, relationships and understanding with senior leaders to transform organizations.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nData Science Team Leader\n\nQuicken Loans\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nThe Session Description will be available shortly.\n\nSession description\n\nWorkforce optimization\n\n11:20 am - 12:05 pm\n\nCase Study: Atlassian\n\nCompanies worldwide make massive investments to make their employees more productive. This endeavor has become more critical than ever as access to a qualified workforce is becoming increasingly challenging. While engaging users with relevant content is certainly a desired outcome, most product implementations still focus on optimizing click-through rate or engagement rather than productivity. As a workforce and management software market leader, Atlassian holds a unique position to determine how project documentation and team communication actually impact the throughput of employees. This talk addresses the intriguing correlations between the usage patterns observed in workforce collaboration tools, and the productivity of the user.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nData Scientist\n\nAtlassian\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: CASE STUDIES - Manifold business applications of machine learning\n\nStudent registration acquisition modeling\n\n11:20 - 11:40 am\n\nCase Study: American Career College\n\nOur overarching goal was to determine the underlying phenomena that create market demand for educational programs. The central question was: Is it the type of program, or the lead to enrollment process, or some identifiable behavior of the leads, or lastly would the demographic attributes turn out to be the chief drivers of enrollment. Rather than model the likelihood of enrollment with all the available variables, we methodically determined the product or school program variables that made them attractive; then the process of enrollment and finally to the behavioral characteristics of prospective students.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nConsultant\n\nRoundrock Management\n\nStudent registration acquisition modeling\n\n11:45 am - 12:05 pm\n\nCase Study: Becker College\n\nPredictive modeling has gained popularity in studying college enrollment due to fierce competition in higher education. To make informed decisions and allocate limited resources to improve enrollment, predictive modeling has been applied to challenge and change the traditional recruitment process. This session is intended for two learning outcomes: Participants who are not familiar with predictive modeling will learn how to lay out a plan to collect and build a comprehensive data infrastructure and conduct predictive modeling. Participants who have run predictive modeling will learn how to critically examine the quality of their predictive analyses.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton\n\n12:05 pm\n\nLunch\n\n1:30 pm\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nKEYNOTE\n\nEnterprise-wide deployment\n\nCase Study: Dell EMC\n\nLooking for tips and pointers on how and where to use machine\n\nlearning? Look no further. In this session, Theresa Kushner - SVP of Dell EMC's\n\nPerformance Analytics Group - will cover best practices as they apply for\n\nmedium to large enterprises, including:\n\n- Tips for multinationals to effectively apply predictive\n\nanalytics in their business – where, how and why?\n\n- Hottest techniques in predictive analytics for enterprises\n\n- Role of start-ups in boosting predictive analytics techniques;\n\napplying external expertise\n\n- How to effectively partner with your IT organization to get\n\nthe most out of machine learning\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nFormerly Sr Vice President, Performance Analytics Group\n\nDell EMC\n\n2:15 pm\n\n2:35 pm\n\n5-minute transition between sessions\n\n2:40 pm\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nValue-driven project strategies\n\nDecisions are never made in a vacuum. They are the product of how decision-makers perceive their policy, political, business, and organizational environment. Shaping their decisions means shaping their environment.\n\nIn this talk, Daniel Porter, Chief Analytics Officer of BlueLabs, will discuss his team’s approach for using data science to shape environments by influencing influencers. The approach pinpoints influencers across different industries and then dynamically scores them on their elasticity and level of influence within a given domain, so that organizations can target the most relevant influencers with ads and outreach, online and offline.\n\nUsing examples from influencer outreach for major organizations, Porter will talk about how his team's approach to identifying and scoring influencers, from Fortune 100 executives to government officials, staff, major donors, and policy elites. Through a combination of data science tools and algorithms ranging from NLP classification to uplift modeling and non-proportional sampling methods, this approach provides organizations with an unparalleled ability to achieve their brand and policy objectives.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nTrack 2: WORKFORCE - Retaining & optimizing HR with analytics\n\nWorkforce optimization; sales analytics\n\nCase Study: Shell International\n\nIn 2017, the HR Analytics team in Shell collaborated with Shell Global Commercial, and connected Sales and HR data to improve the way we hire, reward, and develop sales account managers. The research project, called Project Spark, developed an Individual Sales Performance Model to identify key drivers of Sales Performance. Statistical modelling techniques (e.g. general linear modelling, logistic regression analysis, multi-level modelling) were applied to understand the effects of, for example, Personality, Career Types, and Team Leadership on Sales Performance. Based on the insights, Global Commercial and HR are co-designing practical solutions to get the best out of our people.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeakers\n\nHR Analytics Manager\n\nShell International\n\nHR Analytics Analyst\n\nShell International\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: CASE STUDIES - Manifold business applications of machine learning\n\nIP video player data analysis\n\n2:40 - 3:00 pm\n\nCase Study: Comcast Cable\n\nComcast data scientists need to use the vast resources of our in-house data lake in order to perform ML tasks such as anomaly detection. In the schema-onread model of data lakes, a data scientist first has to find datasets of interest, infer the meaning of each attribute, and clean up the data to enable joins across datasets and to ensure equivalent data (e.g., timestamp or geo location) is represented in the same format or vocabulary. Typically 80% of her time is spent on these tasks, before she can begin identifying features of interest and actually running the ML models.\n\nHow does data governance make feature engineering easy? Imagine a data lake in which datasets are represented via peer-reviewed Apache Avro schemas, using common sub-schemas, with the semantics and format of each attribute well-documented. A metadata repository enables data discovery based on these schemas, and also stores end-to-end lineage from streaming data capture through storage in the lake. Governance also enforces schemas to be compatible when they evolve, so that data stored in different schema versions don’t need to be converted before use in feature engineering. Also, by definition, the features are already defined in the datasets in a common Avro representation. Finally, it allows the data preparation for ML to become generic and therefore re-usable, e.g. extracting from any data set a time series of a single value (i.e. a feature) according to several dimensions.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeakers\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nComcast Cable\n\nPrincipal Data Architect\n\nComcast Cable\n\nPricing\n\n3:05 – 3:25 pm\n\nThe point of a business is to maximize profit. The best way is to always have the best price. But sometimes it makes sense to offer discounts to focus on the long term. This talk will focus on building and deploy such a tool, internationalization and dealing with a large number of Shiny users.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nKey Account Manager\n\nAppsilon Data Science\n\n3:25 pm\n\nExhibits & Afternoon Break\n\n3:55 pm\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nThought leadership; research & development\n\nThe opportunities and challenges created by the expanding size and definition of data has become the catalyst for many universities across the country to think differently. The evolving discipline of data science is changing the way universities approach education, research and funding. In particular, the way universities collaborate with the private sector for research and development has fundamental changed - at least when it comes to data science. And, importantly, this new private sector/university collaborative framework has, in turn, contributed to the evolution of Data Science for both parties.\n\nIn this session, Dr. Jennifer Lewis Priestley, director of one of the country's first Ph.D. program in Data Science, will talk about how the relationship between universities and private sector companies has been impacted by the evolution of data science.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nProfessor of Applied Statistics and Data Science\n\nKennesaw State University\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nTrack 2: WORKFORCE - Retaining & optimizing HR with analytics\n\nWorkforce optimization\n\n3:55 - 4:15 pm\n\nCase Study: Centric Consulting\n\nOur consulting company, Centric, was struggling with low utilization - too many employees were not on billable projects. We designed and implemented a machine learning model to help us better understand the factors driving employee utilization. Although we had only a few hundred rows of data with which to work, the insights gained were used to redesign internal business processes, resulting in a 13% gain in utilization which in turn resulted in a nearly 20% improvement in company-wide profitability. In this session, we will cover the process we took from designing the machine learning model to implementing our findings in \"real life,\" including tips, tricks, and lessons learned.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nCloud & Artificial Intelligence Practice Lead\n\nCentric Consulting\n\nWorkforce optimization\n\n4:20 – 4:40 pm\n\nCase Study: Baptist Health Medical Group\n\nEngaging employees is critical for any organization. It doesn't need to be difficult, and it doesn't need to be expensive. In this case study, the Baptist Health Medical Group's Practice Optimization Team will demonstrate what it did (and what you can do) to measure employee engagement, and use statistics-based insights to take engagement to the next level.\n\nIn this session, we will share our approach for:\n\n1) Asking the right questions,\n\n2) Identifying engagement drivers,\n\n3) Communicating insights to leadership, and\n\n4) Creating team-generated action plans.\n\nYou already have the tools and budget to do what we did. We will show you how.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nDirector, Practice Optimization\n\nBaptist Health Medical Group\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: CASE STUDIES - Manifold business applications of machine learning\n\nCustomer service analytics\n\nCase Study: Google\n\nAt Google, we developed analytical methods to evaluate the hypothesis that Universal Agents, who handle support calls across several products, would outperform Laned Agents, who are specialized to support only a single product. Here in Google's gTech group, initially operating under the assumption that Universal Agents would have higher utilization than the more prevalent Laned Agents, Google increased the number thereof, thereby creating the opportunity to collect the data needed to make this comparison. After several months, we compared the two strategies. To do so, however, required some innovation, since many factors impact agent performance. To normalize for these factors and get a clean adjusted estimate of performance, we applied a form of mixed modeling (an advanced form of ANOVA). Our findings were counterintuitive: Universal Agents under-perform Laned agents in overall cost and measures of customer satisfaction. This project corrected many misconceptions and resulted in a relative increase in Laned Agents.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nHead of Analytics - YouTube Trust and Safety\n\nGoogle\n\n4:40 pm\n\n5-minute transition between sessions\n\n4:45 pm\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nValue-driven project management\n\nAnalytics is hard and getting stakeholders and executives to act and use the results from analytics may be even harder. In this presentation we argue that to turn analytics into advantage requires: (1) choosing the right analytical target to go after, (2) building credibility for the insights, (3) offering the tools that turn the insights into decision alternatives. We showcase these factors via 5 actual business case studies (each of which proved to benefit greatly from their efforts).\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nCEO\n\nKwantum LLC and University of La Crosse, WI\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nTrack 2: WORKFORCE - Retaining & optimizing HR with analytics\n\nLegality and ethics in operationalization\n\nPredictive analytics tools hold great promise for harnessing the power of data to make empirically-based decisions with significant increases in efficiency and effectiveness. However, predictive analytics tools come under special scrutiny when used for high-stakes decision-making such as employment selection. Join us for an overview of foundational laws, theories of discrimination, and approaches for measuring adverse impact and validity in the use of predictive analytics for employment purposes.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeakers\n\nVice President of Employment and Litigation Support Services\n\nDCI Consulting Group\n\nChief Analyst\n\nFormerly at Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: CASE STUDIES - Manifold business applications of machine learning\n\nCustomer service analytics\n\nCase Study: IBM\n\nIBM Technical Support handles over a million tickets per year and is committed to helping clients solve technical issues and creating optimal client experience. An always-on prediction system was recently developed to automatically forecast the daily client experience outcomes by ticket prior to ticket resolution. Support agents use it to prioritize their workload and take tailored actions to improve client experience of high risk tickets. In this session, I'll introduce the journey of developing the prediction system via iterations by combining classical statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and human feedback to achieve significant improvement in model quality and user adoption.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nSenior Data Scientist\n\nIBM\n\n5:30 pm\n\nNetworking Reception\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nTrack 2: WORKFORCE - Retaining & optimizing HR with analytics\n\nWorkforce analytics\n\n5:30 PM to 5:50 PM\n\nCase Study: Twitter\n\nAttracting and retaining the right talent continues to be a struggle, especially in the Silicon Valley. Advances in statistical modeling have allowed us to predict and understand in depth and breadth why employees leave companies. This presentation will walk through some of the analytic techniques being used at Twitter, such as survival analysis, decision trees, etc. being used to predict employee attrition.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nPeople Data Scientist\n\nTwitter\n\n7:00 pm\n\nDinner with Strangers\n\n7:00 pm\n\nEnd of first Conference Day\n\nPredictive Analytics World for Business - Las Vegas - Day 2 - Wednesday, June 6th, 2018\n\n8:00 am\n\nRegistration & Networking Breakfast\n\n8:45 am\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nKEYNOTE\n\nWhat does a 90-year old company have to do with predictive analytics? Quite frankly, everything. Through predictive analytics services and solutions, Caterpillar is increasing the value of its equipment and commitment to its customers by helping them predict potential outcomes and make better business decisions. Morgan Vawter, Caterpillar’s Chief Analytics Director, will share how this legacy company is combining domain expertise with vast amounts of data and advanced mathematical techniques to help its customers build a better world through better fuel productivity, increased safety, planned downtime and other predictable efficiencies.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nGlobal VP of Data & Analytics\n\nUnilever\n\n9:30 am\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nPLENARY SESSION\n\nRexer Analytics has been surveying analytic professionals for over a decade. In 2017, over a thousand people from around the world participated in the 8th Data Science Survey. In this PAW session, Karl Rexer will present highlights of recent survey results and discuss trends from the past decade. Highlights will include:\n\n- Key algorithms\n\n- Deep learning adoption and key techniques\n\n- Challenges of self-service analytics\n\n- Analytic software adoption\n\n- Job satisfaction & job prospects\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nPresident\n\nRexer Analytics\n\n9:40 am\n\n10:00 am\n\n5-minute transition between sessions\n\n10:05 am\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nSourcing analytics staff\n\nCase Study: Verizon\n\nIn a world where demand outpaces supply, finding and keeping analytics talent has become a real dilemma. Identifying the right mix of business skills and analytics skills can feel like an impossible search. With so many people looking for strong talent, it often becomes difficult to compete. How do you attract the right skills to your team to ensure a strong analytics capability? What types of levels, roles, and titles do you need? What are some of the ways to ensure you retain your analytics talent? This session will discuss different compositions of successful analytics teams, as well as titles, career paths, and tips to win at the salary game.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nChief Strategy Officer\n\nKinaxis\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nTrack 2: TECH - Predictive modeling & machine learning methods\n\nModel interpretation\n\nCase Study: YMCA\n\nAs data science captures more attention from decision makers, translating the models from the language of the analyst into a language of the decision maker has become an important topic at conferences and in journals. It used to be that the focus on data storytelling was on visualization techniques. While this is important, as analyses become more complex, the task of interpreting the models likewise becomes more complex. Before we can decide on visualization techniques, we first need to uncover what to visualize. In this presentation, Mr. Abbott will describe ways to unravel complex descriptive and predictive models so they can be explained and visualized using machine learning models and resampling techniques.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nChief Data Scientist\n\nAbbott Analytics\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: MARKETING - Analytics for customer acquisition & retention\n\nMarketing analytics strategy\n\n10:05 - 10:25 am\n\nCase Study: John Hancock\n\nBy 2021, Digital Marketing spend will near $120B in US and will be 46% of overall marketing spend. People-based marketing is a foundation of improving targeting efficiency. Successful targeting requires a combination of sophisticated modeling, deployment and application of both think and learn and test and learn methods. In this presentation, we will go over some of the results and lessons learned by John Hancock in its Direct to Consumer (D2C) journey, that went from 0 - 60 in less than a year.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nData Science Director\n\nJohn Hancock Insurance\n\nResponse modeling for marketing\n\n10:30 – 10:50 am\n\nCase Study: Central Pacific Bank\n\nIn 2017, our bank implemented a machine learning propensity model in our direct consumer campaign. As a result we saw a 40% reduction in marketing cost and a 70% increase in response rate. Building a machine learning model is hard; convincing the organization to implement it is harder. In this session, we will present a success story of how we convinced the management committee to implement a machine learning model that appears to them like a black box. As a result, we saw a culture shift; the organization is now more willing to explore data science solution in other products.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeakers\n\nData Scientist\n\nCentral Pacific Bank\n\nData Scientist\n\nCentral Pacific Bank\n\n10:50 am\n\nExhibits & Morning Coffee Break\n\n11:20 am\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nAnalytics leadership\n\nCase study: CA Technologies\n\nAfter 3 years of building a global analytics team for a 4B software company from bottoms up, we are now the go-to analytics shop for CA Technologies.

(UK consumer reports)\n\nA predictive model used in production has an incredible amount of manual overhead. That restricts the “real work” that a data scientist can do. If you can identify and automate that 85/90% of the work, what can be achieved? In this presentation, the elements of “model process automation” will be broken down and discussed using open source software throughout to demonstrate the logic. A real world example will be shown with Which? (the UK equivalent of Consumer Reports and Consumer Advocates) using 29,000 pricing ensemble models that create, train, build, tune and score every day totally automatically. From this example, best practices will be discussed.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nAuthor and Thought Leader\n\nCIAgenda\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: MARKETING - Analytics for customer acquisition & retention\n\nOptimizing fan engagement\n\n11:20 - 11:40 am\n\nCase Study: Viacom\n\nWith a portfolio of brands ranging from Nickelodeon to Comedy Central, Viacom distributes and markets content that appeals to all demographics across the globe.

By utilizing NLP algorithms, we can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation. We leveraged NLP algorithms to dive deeper into customer complaint narratives and to identify major complaint themes. Moreover, we quantified underlying consumer sentiment and ultimately develop actionable consumer insights. These insights were useful for developing more effective Marketing and Customer Experience strategies.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nVice President - Data Science\n\nBarclaycard US\n\n4:15 pm\n\nRoom: Pompeian III\n\nTrack 1: BUSINESS - Analytics operationalization & management\n\nAnalytics talent\n\nCase Study: Cisco\n\nData professionals expect a lot from their leaders and organizations, and they are in higher demand than ever. How do you build an organization that Data Scientists are proud to be a part of, one that leverages the network effects of the analytics community as a whole? How do you keep your team focused on the projects that drive organizational goals forward, while satisfying the insatiable hunger for technical knowledge and “interesting work?” And a leader’s work doesn’t stop there: How do you get the most out of the cross-functional skills that your team members possess (both technical and otherwise), and how do you ensure that the critical analytics roles in your organization are properly recognized and rewarded for their contributions? Join Cisco for an insider look at what’s working today…and what’s planned for tomorrow.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nDirector, Enterprise Data Science Office and Digital Process Transformation CoE\n\nCisco\n\nRoom: Augustus II\n\nTrack 2: TECH - Predictive modeling & machine learning methods\n\nAdvanced methods\n\nWe've all heard the hype. Being Bayesian is cool, right? But does it really offer any clear benefits over the frequentist approach, or is it just a different way of thinking about the solutions we already have on hand? The Bayesian approach does enable a very powerful class of models: multi-level/hierarchical models. With a new generation of statistical modeling platforms like the free tool STAN, these models can be built with rich structures that enable more granular insights. We will learn about the power of multi-level models through three concrete examples: digital UX optimization, market response modeling, and programmatic media optimization.\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nSenior Data Scientist\n\nElicit\n\nRoom: Augustus I\n\nTrack 3: MARKETING - Analytics for customer acquisition & retention\n\nTime series analysis\n\nTime series analysis has not benefited much from the data science halo effect compared to, say, statistical learning techniques. Yet time series model are often used to inform some of the most critical and fundamental business decisions.\n\nCase in point: when evaluating the overall health of a business, we typically look at high-level metrics such as CAC, top-line growth and margin. And when it comes to forecasting these metrics and planning the underlying investments in marketing, inventory and promotions, you need time series analysis\n\nIn this talk we’ll take a random walk through topics related to time series analysis as it pertains to planning:\n\nWhy having robust planning models is important, even though you’ll always be wrong\n\nThe skill set and attitude needed to be good at building the underlying models\n\nEmbracing uncertainty as opposed to trying to make it go away\n\nHow to think about promo/price versus top-of-funnel spending\n\nWhen ML and time series come together\n\nSession description\n\nSpeaker\n\nVP of Data\n\nThirdLove\n\n5:00 pm\n\nEnd of second Conference Day\n\nWorkshops - Thursday, June 7th, 2018\n\n8:30 am\n\nRoom: Emperors I\n\nPost-Conference Training Workshop\n\nFull-day: 8:30am – 4:30pm\n\nThis one-day session reveals the subtle mistakes analytics practitioners often make when facing a new challenge (the “deadly dozen”), and clearly explains the advanced methods seasoned experts use to avoid those pitfalls and build accurate and reliable models.
