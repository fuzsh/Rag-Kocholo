        "text": "photo, Lou Agosta\n\nThe consolidation in the data mining (predictive analytics) market during the past two years has been continuous and merciless. One of the key lessons for both users and providers of data mining technology and applications is that it is in the process of transitioning to predictive analytics.\n\nSilicon Graphics' MineSet, which once boasted a substantial installed base, is not currently shipping a product. Trajecta was a data mining startup circa 1999 emerging from the incubation laboratory at Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation. Fair Isaac acquired the core Trajecta technology in 2002. Fair Isaac and HNC merged in August 2002. The sun has set on Business Miner from Business Objects, although Business Miner continues to have significant recognition in the desktop data mining market. Meanwhile, Business Objects has been offering KXEN predictive analytics as an encapsulated part of its Application Foundation and as a separately licensable product since January 2003 (initially bundled as part of the entire suite in June 2002). Instead of Darwin, Oracle now offers a migration path to Oracle9i Data Mining analytics. In the face of a perfect storm of bad economic news and externalities, even top-notch technology can be culled from the flock as if by a Darwinian process, including tools with that name. The lessons of consolidation are described in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe promise of giving all different classes of end users access to data mining (predictive analytics) is oversold - data mining will require a cross-functional, collaborative effort and predictive modeling tools that support collaboration will have an advantage. Data preparation can consume a substantial effort, and data mining tools require further productivity enhancements to address those requirements. The data is to be found in the database and \"in database data mining\" is the technology of the future and always will be,..."
