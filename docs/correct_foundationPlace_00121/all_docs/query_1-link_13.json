        "text": "This chapter provides overviews of PeopleSoft EPM Foundation setups and multiple currency management, and discusses how to:\n\nReview installed products.\n\nView charts and print results.\n\nSpecify your EPM sources.\n\nSet up country and state information.\n\nSet up time zones.\n\nDefine account calendars.\n\nSet up the Gregorian calendar for the Performance Management Warehouse.\n\nDefine operator defaults.\n\nDefine units of measure.\n\nSet up ledger-based nVision reporting for EPM.\n\nSet up EPM currency tables.\n\nSet up market rates for EPM currency conversion.\n\nDefine currency quotations for EPM currency conversion.\n\nEstablish market rates for EPM currency conversion.\n\nCalculate currency rates for EPM currency conversion.\n\nConfigure currency precision for EPM currency conversion.\n\nNote. Please be aware that the order in which the setup tasks are presented in this chapter do not indicate the actual order in which they should be performed during implementation. It is highly recommended that you use Setup Manager to determine the implementation tasks that are required for your organization and the related implementation sequence.\n\nUnderstanding PeopleSoft EPM Foundation Setups\n\nAfter installing your EPM product, you must set up the infrastructure, key business rules, and processing variables for the product. These rules provide the foundation on which EPM operates and can include country and state, unit of measure, language, and currency information. Because these rules act as a foundation and span the entire EPM product suite, you must perform these setup tasks prior to beginning other EPM implementation tasks documented in this guide.\n\nThe business rules and processing variables that you define for EPM are stored in EPM database tables. You define these rules and populate the EPM tables using the PeopleSoft Pure Internet Architecture pages in the EPM Setup menu. These pages are built over EPM tables that are shared among many PeopleSoft applications.\n\nUnderstanding EPM Multiple Currency Management\n\nThis section discusses:\n\nMultiple currency management.\n\nCurrency and calculation types.\n\nRevaluation.\n\nCurrency precision.\n\nCurrency as a ChartField.\n\nCurrency Conversion application engine (PF_MULT_CURR) for Analytical Applications.\n\nMultiple Currency Management\n\nPeopleSoft enables you to manage financial information in multiple currencies. PeopleSoft provides specific input, processing, and reporting features that support the European Common Currency (euro), currency conversions, remeasurement, revaluation, translation, and a complete audit trail of all multicurrency processing.\n\nYou can define and maintain tables that describe currency codes, exchange rates, market rates, and currency rate types. All PeopleSoft applications use the same market rate and currency pages and tables, which enables you to administer centralized currency controls throughout the integrated product lines.\n\nBefore you begin to process multiple currencies, you must understand how foreign currency processing works in EPM and how to set up your system for multiple currencies.\n\nNote. The MDW and OWE each have their own currency conversion process. The following sections contain common setup information for both currency conversion processes.\n\nSee Implementing Currency Conversion in the Multidimensional Warehouse.\n\nSee Setting Up and Running Currency Conversion for the OWE.\n\nCurrency and Calculation Types\n\nPeopleSoft software uses terminology associated with currency that is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standards.\n\nCurrency refers to the denomination of a monetary transaction. PeopleSoft applications use a currency code (CURRENCY_CD) to identify and track individual currencies. Although the system does not require it, you should use International Standards Organization (ISO) currency codes. PeopleSoft applications have no limit on the number of currencies that you can use.\n\nImportant currency terms are:\n\nImportant currency calculation types are:\n\nRevaluation\n\nWhen you adjust the base currency value of balance sheet accounts that are maintained in a foreign currency, this is called revaluation. You generally perform revaluations at the end of each accounting period to reflect the actual base currency value of assets and liabilities as exchange rates fluctuate between the base and foreign currencies. You make adjusting entries to the accounts that are being revalued with an offsetting entry to a revaluation gain or loss account. The gain or loss account is sometimes referred to as an unrealized exchanged gain or loss.\n\nIn this example, a London-based subsidiary of a Swiss company records a purchase made in Mexican pesos. The Swiss company is owned by a United States corporation. The following table correlates the terminology and the currencies:\n\nForeign currency\n\nMXN (Mexican Peso)\n\nBase currency\n\nGBP (British pounds)\n\nFunctional currency\n\nCHF (Swiss francs)\n\nReporting currency\n\nUSD (United States dollars)\n\nCurrency Precision\n\nCurrency dictates the precision of monetary amounts. For example, United States dollar amounts have two digits to the right of the decimal and Japanese yen have none. The system addresses currency precision as follows:\n\nPeopleSoft software provides currency-sensitive amount fields with a standard length of 23.3, or 23 digits to the left of the decimal point and 3 digits to the right of the decimal point.\n\nBy default, the system rounds all currency-sensitive amount fields to the currency precision of the associated currency. This action is a PeopleSoft PeopleTools option that you can deactivate.\n\nAll numbers on SQR reports are currency-sensitive. For reporting with Crystal and PS/nVision, the display is equal to the field precision, but you can increase the number of decimal places.\n\nCurrency as a ChartField\n\nYou get the best results when you record multicurrency transactions with a currency ChartField. This approach enables you to record multiple currencies in the same ledger and reinforces the concept of a ledger's role as a record for an entire category of information (such as actuals, budgets, forecasts, or commitments).\n\nReviewing Installed Products\n\nBefore you can begin working with any PeopleSoft EPM application, you must specify installation options to indicate how you plan to use the system and which applications you will be using. Installation options are defined for your entire database—they are not specific to a business unit or setID.\n\nThis section discusses how to:\n\nReview installed PeopleSoft EPM products.\n\nReview installed PeopleSoft Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products.\n\nSet Web Services options.\n\nPages Used to Set Installation Options\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nEPM Products\n\nINSTALLATION_PF1\n\nEPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Installation Analysis & Options, Installation Options, EPM Products\n\nReview installed PeopleSoft Enterprise Performance Management products.\n\nERP Products\n\nINSTALLATION_PF2\n\nEPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Installation Analysis & Options, Installation Options, ERP Products\n\nReview installed PeopleSoft ERP products.\n\nWeb Services\n\nINSTALLATION_PF3\n\nEPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Installation Analysis & Options, Installation Options, Web Services\n\nSet web services options.\n\nReviewing Installed PeopleSoft EPM Products\n\nAccess the EPM Products page.\n\nReviewing Installed PeopleSoft ERP Products\n\nAccess the ERP Products page.\n\nSetting Web Services Options\n\nAccess the Web Services page.\n\nWarning! Because each merge job in a jobstream reads in the number of concurrent updates, changing its value while merge processes are running can have unexpected results. Changes to the process wait time affect only subsequent runs of the engine.\n\nSee Also\n\nStreamlining Processing with Jobstreams\n\nViewing Scorecard Results\n\nViewing Charts and Printing Results\n\nSome PeopleSoft Enterprise Performance Management applications use charts. To view these charts, the AVS charting tool must be installed. In addition, complete the following procedure to set up required options:\n\nNavigate to EPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Installation Analysis & Options, Installation Options, Web Services.\n\nSelect the Chart Server check box.\n\nThis enables you to use the basic charting features.\n\nTo enable applets, select the Applets check box.\n\nNote that applets download code to the client workstation.\n\nYou can also print any of the pages that display results. To produce an optimal printout, set your internet browser to print background colors and images.\n\nIn Internet Explorer, follow these steps to set this option:\n\nSelect Tools, Internet Options.\n\nSelect the Advanced tab.\n\nScroll through the list of settings to view the Printing options.\n\nSelect the Print background colors and images check box, and click OK.\n\nSpecifying Your EPM Sources\n\nThis section provides an overview of the relationship between source system data and EPM, and discusses how to define warehouse sources.\n\nUnderstanding Source System Data and EPM Foundation\n\nEPM Foundation enables you to extract, transform, and consolidate data from multiple source transaction systems into a series of target warehouse tables in the EPM database. This means that the EPM database can contain data from several Enterprise, Enterprise One, and third-party sources. Although the data is commingled in the EPM database, certain EPM processes require the ability to trace the data in target warehouse tables to its original source (original source transaction system). Other EPM processes use specific attributes associated with the source transaction system to process data. For example, the language swap utility uses the source system's base language for multiple language processing.\n\nBecause source system information is required, you must define the source in EPM and specify the attributes associated with that source using the Define Warehouse Sources page. Information specified on this page include source system ID (SRC_SYS_ID), base currency, and base language, and is used in several different EPM processes. Most notably, the source system ID is used in the ETL process and helps to maintain source data history as well as data uniqueness. Currency and rate type are used in multiple currency processing. The source system ID and default setID are used later to define warehouse business units.\n\nSingle Signon and Your GL Source Database\n\nThe Global Consolidations analytical application has a feature that enables you to drill down to your source GL database from the consolidation audit using the PeopleTools single signon feature. The single signon feature enables you to access additional PeopleSoft FSCM databases without entering an ID or a password after you have already been authenticated in another PeopleSoft database.\n\nIn order to use the Global Consolidations GL drill-down feature you must set up the single signon feature for each GL source in PeopleTools. You must also use the Define Warehouse Sources page to associate the GL source system ID with its corresponding single signon portal information. This information is used to build the URL to transfer to a GL instance.\n\nSee PeopleSoft Enterprise Global Consolidations 9.0 PeopleBook\n\nSee PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools PeopleBook: Security Administration\n\nSee Also\n\nImporting Source Business Units into EPM to Create Warehouse Business Units\n\nPage Used to Specify EPM Sources\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nDefining Warehouse Sources\n\nAccess the Define Warehouse Sources page.\n\nDefaults for WBU Creation (Defaults for Warehouse Business Unit Creation)\n\nSingle Signon Portal Details (Optional)\n\nUse this section to associate a GL source system ID with its corresponding single signon portal information. Completing this section is optional if you are not implementing the GL drill down feature of the Global Consolidations analytical application.\n\nSetting Up Country and State Information\n\nThis section discusses how to:\n\nReview country descriptions.\n\nSelect an address format by country.\n\nValidate addresses.\n\nDefine countries for reporting.\n\nSpecify state information.\n\nPages Used to Set up Country and State Information\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nReviewing Country Descriptions\n\nAccess the Country Table - Country Description page.\n\nThe system displays the country code, description, and a short description for the country.\n\nPeopleSoft delivers a fully populated country code table, which is updated as national boundaries and designations change.\n\nSelecting an Address Format by Country\n\nAccess the Country Table - Address Format page.\n\nUse this page to set up three aspects of the address: editing, displaying, and printing.\n\nThe address format that you specify on this page appears everywhere that the address subrecord is used in the system.\n\nValidating Addresses\n\nAccess the Valid Address page.\n\nTo enable this page, select the Enable Address Search check box on the Address Format page, which enables the Used in Search column. The fields that you select to be used in a search appear on the Valid Address page as columns. Enter the valid address combinations that the user can search for and select.\n\nDefining Countries for Reporting\n\nAccess the Country Statistics page.\n\nNote. PeopleSoft EPM only uses this page to establish the countries for statistical purposes. So most of the following information is for informational purposes only, because the reports mentioned are not available through the PeopleSoft EPM database. For more information on the reports mentioned in the following section, refer to the appropriate PeopleSoft Financials application documentation.\n\nSpecifying State Information\n\nAccess the State page.\n\nPeopleSoft delivers a fully populated state code table. PeopleSoft updates the state table as changes occur. This table provides states, provinces, and equivalent geopolitical entities (for example, Dutch communities and French departments) for all supported countries. The codes are based on standard postal codes.\n\nSetting Up Time Zones\n\nEPM extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs use the date time stamp in conjunction with source records to perform incremental loads. However, data can be extracted from multiple source transaction systems, each of which might reside in different database servers that use different time zones and different date and time stamps. This can lead to mismatched dates and times between the source and the EPM database. However, EPM target warehouse tables may include a source time zone field for records that have a date-time or time value depending upon the design and requirement.\n\nWhen a target warehouse table contains a time zone field, prepackaged ETL jobs populate it with your source time zone values. Not all target warehouse tables contain a time zone field.\n\nNote. Only one source time zone value can be populated in the target warehouse table.\n\nPopulating warehouse target tables with source time zone values is the first step in ensuring the synchronicity of source and EPM time zones. However, you are responsible for converting the source time zone value to the EPM database time zone.\n\nDefining Accounting Calendars\n\nThis section provides an overview of accounting calendar setup, lists common elements, and discusses how to:\n\nDefine a base calendar.\n\nModify or add detail calendars.\n\nDefine summary calendars.\n\n(Optional) Define business calendars.\n\n(Optional) Define daily calendars.\n\n(Optional) Define budget calendars.\n\nDefine calendar frequencies.\n\nDefine frequency details.\n\nDefine timespans.\n\nUnderstanding Accounting Calendar Setup\n\nIn PeopleSoft systems, you can establish an accounting period configuration based on the beginning and ending period dates that you normally use and combine these periods to create accounting calendars. These calendars define the time periods to which you post transactions or create reports for different ledger group and business unit combinations. You select the calendar that defines the periods for a business unit and ledger group combination.\n\nYou can maintain an unlimited number of accounting periods over any span of years. You can maintain traditional monthly periods, including an additional adjustment period, or you can define your own periods.\n\nNote. In the PeopleSoft EPM product line, calendars are used mostly for reporting. However, for the system to properly handle data (for example, general ledger data) from your transaction database, you must be sure that the detail calendars match those in your transaction accounting system. You can move calendars from your PeopleSoft transaction database into your PeopleSoft EPM database using PeopleTools such as Data Mover.\n\nThe PeopleSoft system supports multiple calendars, so you can keep one calendar for actuals, another for budget and forecast activity, and still others for special reporting needs. Because you store calendars in tables, you can share them across business units, helping to provide consistency in period dates and easing the process of acquisition and consolidation.\n\nPeopleSoft uses the following calendar definition options:\n\nCommon Elements Used in This Section\n\nPages Used to Define Accounting Calendars\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nDefining a Base Calendar\n\nAccess the Calendar Builder page.\n\nNote. As you define calendars, keep in mind that in all instances in which a PeopleSoft EPM warehouse business unit is related to a general ledger business unit, the calendars for the business units should be the same. Warehouse business units are described elsewhere in this chapter.\n\nAfter you have saved a calendar using the calendar builder, you can only modify the calendar description or long description on the Calendar Builder page. If you need to modify the saved calendar further, use the other calendar pages, (for example the Detail Calendar page).\n\nBy default, a calendar that you create with the Calendar Builder is a detail calendar.\n\nAdding or Modifying Detail Calendars\n\nAccess the Detail Calendar page.\n\nYou create detail calendars using the Calendar Builder. Use this page to modify calendars after they have been created.\n\nWhen you enter period dates, you can define monthly calendar periods or any fiscal period that matches your accounting calendar (such as weekly or bimonthly) as long as the beginning and ending dates of successive periods don't overlap. Every day of the year must be included in a period; you cannot leave gaps between period dates. Make sure that your detail calendar includes a period for the oldest transaction that you want to enter. After installing your PeopleSoft system, you might want to make this earliest date more restrictive.\n\nYou will need to return to this page to enter ensuing years manually. You can enter several years at a time or treat the task as part of your end-of-year system maintenance.\n\nAfter you define your detail calendar, you can use it to manage open periods for the generation of journals. You can also use it to define the periods that store summarized results in a summary ledger.\n\nNote. The MODEL calendar delivered with your system contains data from 1957 to 2025. You can use the MODEL calendar rather than entering your own data; if you do so, make a copy of MODEL first, and make changes to the copy.\n\nDefining Summary Calendars\n\nAccess the Summary Calendar page.\n\nConsider the following when setting up summary calendars. A quarterly summary calendar, for example, might have four periods, each consisting of three periods from a monthly detail calendar. A summary calendar can also combine cumulative detail calendar accounting periods to create year-to-date balances. Summary calendars are especially useful for determining how your models will roll up for reporting purposes. As with detail calendars, you can include as many fiscal years as you need in one summary calendar.\n\nEnter a description and periods per fiscal year to specify the number of periods in the accounting year for this calendar.\n\nSupply the fiscal year, period, period name, and abbreviation.\n\nNote. You can define as many years on a calendar as necessary. Be sure to include any years that you use to store historical information.\n\nDefining Summary Budget Period Calendars\n\nAccess the Summary Budget Period Calendar page.\n\nSummary calendars are especially useful for determining how your models will roll up for reporting purposes. Enter a description, budget period, and from/to periods to specify the number of budget periods in the accounting year for this calendar.\n\nDefining Business Calendars (Optional)\n\nAccess the Business Day Calendar page.\n\nIn the grid at the bottom of the page enter a row for each holiday on which you know businesses won't operate.\n\nIn multinational corporations, you accommodate the various locations and different holidays observed by defining as many business calendars as you need for each setID.\n\nNote. Business calendars determine the number of workdays in each month, for reporting purposes only.\n\nNote. If you use PeopleSoft Asset Liability Management, Funds Transfer Pricing, or Risk-Weighted Capital, you must create a business day calendar to define your holidays.\n\nDefining Daily Calendars (Optional)\n\nAccess the Daily Calendar page.\n\nRemember to set up a calendar for each fiscal year. To display the detail periods for existing calendars, click the Update button.\n\nNote. For leap years, you must change the periods per fiscal year value from 365 to 366 to create the last period for the leap year (for example, December 31, 2004).\n\nDefining Budget Calendars (Optional)\n\nAccess the Budget Calendar page.\n\nFor budget calendars, you might want to enter a descriptive calendar ID such as AN for an annual calendar budget.\n\nEnter the budget periods, begin and end dates, and period names.\n\nDefining Calendar Frequencies\n\nAccess the Frequency Definition page.\n\nDefine frequencies by adding a row with a description or by updating an existing description.\n\nNote. The frequencies you define on this page will comprise the list of valid values in the Frequency Details page.\n\nDefining Frequency Details\n\nAccess the Frequency Details page.\n\nDefining Timespans\n\nAccess the TimeSpan page.\n\nNote. Balance forward accounts store balance forward amounts. For example, in your regular accounting system you might want to specify asset, liability, and equity accounts as balance forward accounts, but not revenue or expense accounts. The account balance forward function rolls forward the accounts on any date specified for flexible year-end processing.\n\nSee Also\n\nPeopleSoft Enterprise Global Consolidations 9.0 PeopleBook\n\nSetting Up the Gregorian Calendar for the MDW\n\nThe Calendar dimension represents calendars that fall into two broad functional categories. The Gregorian calendar (the calendar that is commonly used) has one row for each day. The business calendar represents the functionality the PeopleSoft provides to define various types of business calendars, such as detail calendars, summary calendars, budget calendars, and so on.\n\nGregorian calendar setup is a onetime setup as part of the MDW setup. You can generate the Gregorian calendar for a range of years. For each day in the year range, the Gregorian calendar has one row. (You do not define business calendars in the MDW; their definitions are imported from source systems and the OWE).\n\nTo set up the Gregorian calendar, use the Day Dimension (D_DAY) component and the Time Dimension (D_TIME) component.\n\nThis section discusses how to set up the Gregorian Calendar for the Performance Management Warehouse.\n\nPages Used to Set Up the Gregorian Calendar\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nDay Dimension\n\nD_DAY\n\nEPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Common Definitions, Calendars, Gregorian Calendar, Gregorian Calendar Dimension, Day Dimension\n\nPopulate the Day dimension.\n\nTime Dimension\n\nD_TIME\n\nEPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Common Definitions, Calendars, Gregorian Calendar, Time Dimension, Time Dimension\n\nPopulate the Time dimension.\n\nPopulating the Day Dimension\n\nAccess the Day Dimension page.\n\nSave the page and click Run.\n\nClick the Process Monitor link to check the status of application engine program. After a period of time, it should display the status as Success.\n\nPopulating the Time Dimension\n\nAccess the Time Dimension page.\n\nTime Format\n\nSelect either 12 Hour Format or 24 Hour Format.\n\nSave the page and click Run.\n\nClick the Process Monitor link to check the status of application engine program. After a period of time, it should display the status as Success.\n\nDefining Operator Defaults\n\nOperator defaults enable you to assign a default business unit and setID for each user per country. You specify operator defaults on the Operator Defaults page.\n\nPage Used to Specify Operator Defaults\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nOperator Defaults\n\nOPR_DEF_TABLE_FS1\n\nEPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Installation Analysis & Options, Personal Defaults, Operator Defaults\n\nSpecify default user preferences for PeopleSoft users.\n\nSpecifying Default User Preferences\n\nAccess the Operator Defaults page.\n\nNote. You can control the business unit, setID, and address format default values by using the Operator Defaults page.\n\nDefining Units of Measure\n\nUnits of measure (UOM) determine how resources are quantified. Each resource must be associated with a standard unit of measure. Standardization helps you to control the units that appear in reports and enables you to use the PeopleSoft automatic conversion features.\n\nThis section discusses how to:\n\nImport UOM values from a source.\n\nDisplay and modify UOMs.\n\nPage Used to Define UOMs\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nImporting Unit of Measure Values from Your Source\n\nEPM enables you to extract and consolidate source data from various source transaction systems. As such, certain source systems might contain UOM values that are different from those offered in EPM. This causes mismatched UOM values between the source and the EPM database. However, EPM target warehouse tables include source UOM definitions and conversion rate fields for all records that store UOM data. Prepackaged ETL jobs populate these fields with your source UOM definitions and conversion rate values.\n\nPeopleSoft-delivered ETL jobs populate the following target warehouse tables with UOM values:\n\nUNITS_TBL\n\nUNITS_CVT_TBL\n\nINV_ITEM (for Supply Chain Management only)\n\nUOM_TYPE_INV (for Supply Chain Management only)\n\nPopulating warehouse target tables with source UOM values is the first step in ensuring the synchronicity of source and EPM UOM values. However, you are responsible for converting the source UOM value to the EPM database UOM.\n\nDisplaying and Modifying UOMs\n\nAccess the Unit of Measure page.\n\nSetting Up Ledger-Based nVision Reporting for EPM\n\nThis section discusses how to set up ledger-based nVision reporting over EPM ledger tables.\n\nUnderstanding Ledger-Based Reporting and Setup in EPM\n\nnVision is a reporting tool that can retrieve information from a PeopleSoft database and place that data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. nVision selects data from a PeopleSoft database using a query or a ledger. nVision query-based reporting uses PS query to extract information and can be used with the EPM database. However, nVision ledger-based reporting must be modified to extract data from the EPM database. This is due to the manner in which ledger-based reporting extracts data and the unique structure of EPM ledger tables.\n\nnVision ledger-based reporting uses the LEDGER key to distinguish sets of ledger data and identify which rows should be extracted from ledger tables. However, the LEDGER key does not exist in the EPM ledger tables (such as PF_LEDGER_F00). Instead, EPM ledger tables use the key, PF_SCENARIO_ID, to distinguish sets of data. Consequently, the ledger-based reporting process must be modified to accommodate the PF_SCENARIO_ID used by EPM ledger tables.\n\nTo incorporate the PF_SCENARIO_ID key into the nVision ledger-based reporting process, you must create a view of your EPM ledger tables and map the PF_SCENARIO_ID column to the LEDGER column in the view. EPM delivers a view of the PF_LEDGER_F00 table called PF_LEDGER_VW, so you do not need to create one. You only need to create additional ledger views for those ledger tables associated with the PeopleSoft EPM Analytic Applications (for example, GC_LEDGER_F00 for Global Consolidations). For more information about application ledger tables that require a view, see your Analytic Applications PeopleBooks.\n\nIn addition to mapping keys with a ledger view, you must also set up related nVision ledger pages in PIA. The EPM nVision PIA pages populate tables that are used during the ledger-based reporting process (for example, PF_LED_DEFN). When nVision processes a request, it looks for the SET_ID and LEDGER keys located in the PF_LED_DEFN table. The PF_LED_DEFN table is tied to the PF_LED_TEMPLATE table via the LEDGER key, and that connection is used to determine the related data associated with a particular ledger view and PF_SCENARIO_ID. Most of this information is defined in the EPM nVision PIA pages, which are described in the subsequent sections.\n\nSee Enterprise PeopleTools PeopleBook: PS/nVision\n\nSee Enterprise PeopleTools PeopleBook: PeopleSoft Application Designer\n\nLedger-Based Reporting Setup\n\nThe following steps are required to implement ledger-based nVision reporting for EPM:\n\nCreate a ledger template for each ledger view in your database.\n\nThe Ledger Template page populates the PF_LED_TEMPLATE table, which stores the ledger view information, used to tie the LEDGER key to the PF_SCENARIO_ID key.\n\nCreate a detail ledger definition for each scenario.\n\nThe Detail Ledger page populates the PF_LED_DEFN table, which stores the LEDGER and SET_ID keys, used for lookup by nVision reporting.\n\nCreate a ledger group for each detail ledger.\n\nThe Group Definition page enables you to create a ledger group for one or more detail ledgers and specify base currency for those ledgers.\n\nCreate a ledger group for each detail ledger.\n\nThe Ledgers for a Unit Definition page enables you to associate a calendar ID with a ledger group.\n\nPages Used to Set Up nVision Ledger-Based Reporting in EPM\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nDefining a Ledger Template\n\nAccess the Ledger Template page.\n\nDefining a Detail Ledger\n\nAccess the Detail Ledger page.\n\nDefining a Ledger Group for Detail Ledgers\n\nAccess the Ledger Group Definition page.\n\nLedger Details\n\nDefining a Calendar for a Ledger Group\n\nAccess the Ledgers for a Unit Definition page.\n\nThe Ledgers for a Unit Definition page enables you to associate a calendar ID with a ledger group.\n\nNote. The calendar ID should match the calendar ID that is specified on the Warehouse Business Unit Scenario Definition page.\n\nSetting Up EPM Currency Tables\n\nCurrency code pages define each currency that you use. To meet your multicurrency requirements, PeopleSoft supports the euro and delivers the Currency Code table with many common ISO standard currencies. The table also supports the ISO standard of zero, two, and three decimal positions.\n\nThis section discusses how to:\n\nMaintain currency codes.\n\nUpdate the status of a euro currency code.\n\nPages Used to Maintain Currency Tables\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nMaintaining Currency Codes\n\nAccess the Currency Code page.\n\nNote. The data on this page is stored in the Currency Code table. The values on this table are effective-dated. The software is shipped with the Currency Code table in compliance with ISO standards for decimal positions. You can increase the number of decimals to a maximum of three.\n\nNote. PeopleSoft updates the Currency Code table and the fully populated country, state, and province code tables as national boundaries and designations change.\n\nUpdating the Status of a Euro Currency Code\n\nAccess the Currency Code (Euro) page.\n\nNote. Do not attempt to modify the currency quotation methods for currencies that are linked to the euro.\n\nMapping Enterprise One Currency Codes to EPM Currency Codes (for Enterprise One Sources)\n\nEnterprise One currency codes are user defined so they do not conform to standard EPM currency codes. Mismatched currency codes can create unexpected results with your EPM data. Therefore, you must map the Enterprise One currency code to the standard EPM currency code. The mapping information is used during the ETL process to reconcile the conflicting currency codes. Use the E1 Currency Code Mapping page to map Enterprise One currency codes to Enterprise currency codes.\n\nPage Used to Map Enterprise One Currency Codes\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nE1 Currency Code Mapping\n\nE1CURR_MAP\n\nEPM Foundation, EPM Setup, Common Definitions, Currencies and Rates, E1 Currency Mapping, E1 Currency Code Mapping\n\nMap Enterprise One currency codes to EPM currency codes.\n\nMapping Enterprise One Currency Codes\n\nAccess the E1 Currency Code Mapping page.\n\nSetting Up Market Rates for EPM Currency Conversion\n\nThe PeopleSoft approach to market rates and currency conversion is driven by the need to accommodate business practices related to the European Common Currency (euro). In addition to currency exchange rates, PeopleSoft supports the many different types of global market rates, such as interest rates, stock exchange indexes, and economic indicators.\n\nThis section discusses how to:\n\nDefine market rate indexes.\n\nDefine market rate types.\n\nDefine market rate tolerances.\n\nPages Used to Define Market Rates\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nDefining Market Rate Indexes\n\nAccess the Market Rate Index page.\n\nDefining Market Rate Types\n\nAccess the Market Rate Type page.\n\nEnter a description and short description for each market rate type that you use.\n\nDefining Market Rate Tolerances\n\nAccess the Market Rate Definition page.\n\nThe information that appears on this page depends on the type of index that you select. For example, if you select an index with interest rates, interest rates appear on this page.\n\nMarket rate definitions specify the valid term, currency, and other appropriate field combinations for market rates. For example, if you have a market rate definition for an exchange rate with a term of 30, a from currency of EUR, and a to currency of USD, you can enter a rate using this combination in the market rate table. If you do not have a market rate definition, the system creates one for you using the default values.\n\nDefining Currency Quotations for EPM Currency Conversion\n\nThis section provides an overview of currency quotations and discusses how to maintain currency quotation methods.\n\nUnderstanding Currency Quotations\n\nPeopleSoft supports direct and indirect rate quotation, quote units, and triangulation. These are flexible and accurate tools that enable you to convert and manage multicurrency operations.\n\nThe currency quotation method controls how a stored rate is displayed and how an entered rate is interpreted and stored in the database. You set up and maintain a currency quotation method for each from currency and to currency pair.\n\nYou do not typically maintain rates online for currency pairs that triangulate. Instead, the Cross rate/Triangulation Generation SQR determines the cross rate by using the rates between the from currency and the reference currency, and between the reference currency and the to currency.\n\nCurrency quotation methods must be set up correctly to yield the desired triangulation results.\n\nNote. Define currency quotation options before you enter the rates and before you calculate the rates.\n\nPage Used to Define and Maintain Currency Quotations\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nMaintaining Currency Quotation Methods\n\nAccess the Currency Quotation Method page.\n\nRate Quotation Basis\n\nNote. Currency pairs that triangulate must be classified as either direct or indirect to use in displaying the calculated cross rate. Two fields store the rate conversion factor: RATE_DIV and RATE_MULT. The currency conversion formula is always: (From currency ÷ RATE_DIV) ? (RATE_MULT) = To currency\n\nTriangulation Options\n\nSelect the Triangulate check box to have the system convert two currencies through a third currency (the reference currency). Triangulation is used in hyperinflationary environments in which all conversions to the local currency are done through a more stable currency such as USD.\n\nNote. Triangulation was initially used for European countries participating in the euro. However, since 1999 all countries participating in the euro are quoted directly against the foreign currency.\n\nAny countries newly participating in the euro might be initially subject to triangulation, however. The triangulation example below and any other examples in this chapter that show triangulation, use a fictional country, with a currency code of NEW, that has just joined the euro. This country is subject to triangulation.\n\nThe following are examples of indirect quotation, direct quotation with quote units, and triangulation:\n\nUSD 100 to GBP (indirect) = (USD 100 x 1.6) x 1 = GBP 62.50.\n\nCHF 1000 to German marks (DEM) (direct with units) = (CHF 1000 / 100) x 119.335 = DEM 1193.35.\n\nUSD 100 to NEW (triangulate) = (USD 100 / 1.25) x 6.8 = NEW 544.\n\nFor example, to convert from USD to NEW with triangulation, you perform two conversions:\n\nConvert the USD amount to the reference currency using the appropriate triangulated rate.\n\nThe triangulated rate uses the USD to EUR component of the USD to NEW triangulated rate that is stored in RATE_DIV.\n\nConvert the reference currency to NEW using the fixed exchange rate.\n\nThe exchange rate uses the EUR to NEW component of the USD to NEW triangulated rate that is stored in RATE_MULT.\n\nTypically, you do not maintain triangulation rates directly. Instead, you process these and all rates through the Cross/Reciprocal Rate Calculator.\n\nSelect a reference currency through which the from currency will be converted.\n\nYou must consider three exchange rates for triangulated currency pairs:\n\nThe rate between the from currency code and reference currencies.\n\nThe rate between the reference and the to currency code currencies.\n\nThe cross rate between the from currency code and to currency code currencies.\n\nPrimary Visual Rate\n\nSelect one of the three conversion rates as the primary rate that appears on primary pages and reports.\n\nCross Rate\n\nSelect the Allow Override check box to enable users to override the cross rate for a triangulated currency pair. If this option is cleared, you can change the components of only the triangulated rate.\n\nRecalculate\n\nIf you select the Allow Override check box, you must maintain triangulation accuracy by specifying which currency pair the system should use to recalculate if the cross rate is overridden.\n\nAutomatic Reciprocation of Quote Methods\n\nThe Currency Quotation Method page automatically provides reciprocal methods. For example, if you define the conversion of USD to NEW as indirect, this record is automatically created to indicate a quote method of direct. If you change the quote method on the NEW to USD record, the USD to NEW record is updated automatically.\n\nNote. This example uses a hypothetical currency NEW that has just begun participating in the euro and is still subject to triangulation for an initial period.\n\nUsing the conversion of USD to NEW as an example, this table shows each possible field value and its corresponding reciprocal value.\n\nEstablishing Market Rates for EPM Currency Conversion\n\nThis section discusses how to:\n\nDefine market rates.\n\nEstablish rate definitions.\n\nMaintain exchange rates.\n\nLoad market rates.\n\nPages Used to Establish Market Rates\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nDefining Market Rates\n\nAccess the Market Rates page.\n\nYou can edit the rate for non triangulated rates and for triangulated rates if a quotation method has been defined for the currency pair and the Cross rate Allow Overridecheck box is selected on the Currency Quotation Method page. If an override is not allowed, you can update the exchange rate values to and from the reference currency on the Exchange Rate Detail page.\n\nChanging a Triangulated Cross Rate\n\nIf you change a triangulated cross rate, the system recalculates one of the component rates. This can result in the cross rate being recalculated in a manner that is slightly different from the one that you entered. For example, you start with a triangulated rate of RM=6.80000000 and RD=1.25000000 for a cross rate of 5.44000000. If you change the cross rate to 5.43550000:\n\nThe system first recalculates RD to 1.25103486.\n\nThe system then recalculates the cross rate to 5.43550001 based on the first recalculation.\n\nIn rate maintenance, you must accept the recalculation. However, in a situation such as journal entry, a warning message enables you to override triangulation and to use the exact rate that you entered, which results in the rate being stored as RM equal to 5.43550000 and RD equal to 1.\n\nYou can edit the Rate field except when all of these conditions are true:\n\nThe rate is triangulated.\n\nThe primary visual rate is the cross rate.\n\nThe Allow Override check box on the Currency Quotation Method page is cleared for the exchange rate's quotation method.\n\nNote. Typically, you do not maintain triangulated exchange rates online. Instead, maintain the rates of the from currency to the reference currency and the reference currency to the to currency, and then run the Cross rate Reciprocal SQR (EO9030.SQR) to define the triangulated exchange rates.\n\nReciprocal Currency Pairs\n\nIf a quotation method has been defined for the currency pair and if the Auto Reciprocate check box is selected, creating or maintaining a rate for a currency pair automatically creates or updates the rate of the reciprocal currency pair. For example, if you change the USD to GBP rate, the GBP to USD rate automatically is automatically updated. You can only automatically reciprocate currency pairs for which quotation methods have been defined.\n\nIf a rate definition does not already exist for the currency pair, one will be automatically created with the default values of 2.5 percent maximum variance and warning message processing.\n\nEstablishing Rate Definitions\n\nAccess the Market Rate - Rate Definition page.\n\nNote. The results of changing the rate definition do not take effect until you save the Market Rates page.\n\nClick OK to return to the Market Rates page.\n\nMaintaining Exchange Rates\n\nAccess the Market Rate - Exchange Rate Detail page.\n\nThe read-only fields include:\n\nLoading Market Rates\n\nMarket rates can be loaded to the RT_RATE_TBL from any external source using the DataStage ETL tool.\n\nNote. Use the Market Rates page to verify that the market rates were loaded correctly.\n\nCalculating Currency Rates for EPM Currency Conversion\n\nThis section provide an overview of currency calculations and discusses how to:\n\nCalculate cross rates and reciprocal rates.\n\nRun the Currency Exchange Calculator tool.\n\nUnderstanding Currency Calculations\n\nPeopleSoft calculates currency rates for cross rates, triangulated rates, and reciprocal rates.\n\nEPM utilizes two tools for currency calculations:\n\nThe Currency Exchange Calculator tool quickly performs ad hoc currency conversion using the exchange rates that are stored on the market rates table.\n\nThe Cross/Reciprocal Rate Calculator calculates exchange rates and updates the market rates table.\n\nIt performs three functions by generating the rates shown in this table:\n\nPages Used to Calculate Currency Rates\n\nPage Name\n\nObject Name\n\nNavigation\n\nUsage\n\nCalculating Cross Rates and Reciprocal Rates\n\nAccess the Cross/Reciprocal Rate Calculator page.\n\nGenerating Reciprocal Rates\n\nYou can select the Generate Reciprocal Rate check box by itself or in combination with the Rate Triangulate and Generate Cross Rate check boxes. When this option is selected, the system automatically calculates reciprocal rates for currency pairs for which the autoreciprocate option on the currency method is disabled.\n\nThe system does not directly manipulate the exchange rates. The system uses numerator and denominator values such that:\n\n(From currency / RATE_DIV) x RATE_MULT = To currency\n\nGenerating Cross Rates\n\nWhen you select the Generate Cross Rates check box, the system automatically generate cross rates. For example, to generate cross-currency rates for USD, (CAD), and (MXP), you enter USD to CAD = 1.473 and USD to MXP = 9.8793. The system automatically generates CAD to MXP = 9.8793 / 1.473 = 6.7069246.\n\nIf you generate cross rates, you must select a from currency and a to currency. You can enter a wild card of % in either field or both fields to indicatefrom all orto all currencies.\n\nGenerating Triangulation Rates\n\nWhen you select the Rate Triangulate check box, the system converts two currencies through a third currency. If you select rate triangulation, you must select a from currency and a to currency. You can enter a wild card of % in either field or both fields to indicate from all or to all currencies.\n\nRunning the Currency Exchange Calculator Tool\n\nAccess the Currency Exchange Calculator page.\n\nThis tool enables you to enter a rate or an amount in a currency other than the base currency, or to compute an exchange using an alternative rate type.\n\nNote. Do not decrease the number of decimals after you have created transactions for that currency; the system will not properly round the previous rounded amount fields with the new precision.\n\nConfiguring Currency Precision for EPM Currency Conversion\n\nThis section provides an overview of currency precision and discusses how to:\n\nActivate currency precision.\n\nMaintain currency precision by currency.\n\nReport with currency precision.\n\nUnderstanding Currency Precision\n\nAccording to the ISO standard, currency precision can range from zero decimals to three decimals. For example, USD amounts have two digits to the right of the decimal, and JPY have none. To support this dynamic currency precision, the system delivers all of its currency-sensitive amount fields with a standard length of 23.3, or 23 digits to the left of the decimal and three digits to the right. A control currency on the same record exists to control the display and processing of such amount fields.\n\nPeopleSoft applications round all currency-sensitive amount fields to the currency precision of the controlled currency during all online or background processes. For example, in a database that contains amount fields with a length of 23.3, JPY are rounded to 123.000 and USD are rounded to 123.230. The system does not place a nonzero after the decimal for a JPY amount or after the second digit to the right of the decimal for a USD amount.\n\nAlthough amount fields are stored in the database with decimal placeholders, the system displays amount fields with the precision that is appropriate for the currency. For example, it displays JPY as 123 and USD as 123.23. When you enter an amount, you cannot enter more than the defined precision. If you attempt to do so, the system treats the entry as an online error.\n\nPeopleCode programs and background processes round all currency-sensitive amount fields to the currency precision of the controlled currency.\n\nSee Also\n\nConfiguring Currency Precision for EPM Currency Conversion\n\nActivating Currency Precision\n\nCurrency precision is a PeopleSoft PeopleTools option . When it is selected using the PeopleTools Options page, all features of currency precision are activated. When the option is cleared, all amount fields behave as if no controlled currency exists. The system displays amount fields as defined in the PeopleSoft Application Designer and rounds them to the number of decimals defined in the Application Designer.\n\nNote. If you clear the multicurrency check box, the system only supports the default amount field size of 15.3—it does not support the larger amount field size of 23.3. After you clear this check box, selecting it again does not automatically round existing transaction amounts.\n\nMaintaining Currency Precision by Currency\n\nUse the Currency Code page to access the currency code table, in which you define the decimal position by currency. The values in this table are effective dated. The software is shipped with the currency code table in compliance with ISO standards for decimal positions. You can increase the number of decimals to a maximum of three.\n\nWarning! Do not decrease the number of decimals after transactions are entered in that currency; the system does not properly round the previously rounded amount fields with the new precision.\n\nSee Also\n\nMaintaining Currency Codes\n\nReporting with Currency Precision\n\nMost PeopleSoft SQR reports display currency-controlled amounts with the number of decimal places that are defined by the associated currency. For example, a JPY amount appears as 123 on a report, and a United USD amount appears as 123.23.\n\nAmounts on Crystal and PS/nVision (Microsoft Excel) reports appear as two-decimal-place numbers. If you want to show three decimal places on these reports, you must configure the reports to do so.\n\nThird-party reporting tools used by PeopleSoft do not fully support numeric fields greater than 15 digits. Microsoft Excel uses an eight-byte float for numeric fields, which causes values to be truncated after the fifteenth digit.\n\nCrystal displays up to 15 digits correctly. When a value exceeds 15 digits, Crystal inserts invalid numbers into the decimal positions. This is an issue for only very large currency amounts. For any of these reporting tools, the accuracy of the results is:\n\nHundreds of trillions of yen (precision = 0).\n\nTrillions of dollars (precision = 2).\n\nHundreds of billions of dinar (precision = 3).\n\nFor example, if you populate a 23.3 numeric database amount field with the number 2, the following table illustrates the number that is displayed in each type of report.\n\nNumber of Digits\n\nCrystal\n\nExcel\n\nSQR\n\n16\n\n2,222,222,222,222.222\n\n2,222,222,222,222.220\n\n2,222,222,222,222.222\n\n17\n\n22,222,222,222,222.219\n\n22,222,222,222,222.200\n\n22,222,222,222,222.220\n\n18\n\n222,222,222,222,222.188\n\n222,222,222,222,222.000\n\n222,222,222,222,222.200"
