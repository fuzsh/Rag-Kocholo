The main characteristics of the Data Mining process have been identified. A form has been created to check which of those characteristics take place in a real application and how. A random sample of Science Citation Index papers regarding Data Mining and Environmental Applications has been selected. Papers were read by a set of experts and a form was filled in for every paper. The resulting information was mined itself using basic statistical analysis and some specific treatments for multiresponse variables, to get a first picture of what is currently being done in the applications of Data Mining methods to environmental fields. Very interesting results have been obtained which depict very useful information. This information ranges from a general picture of what kind of methods are commonly used to which environmental areas seems to be more deeply using th...\n\nAbstract. In this paper, a tool for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in environmental databases is presented. In the long term, the main goal of this research is to design and develop a tool, named GESCONDA, for intelligent data analysis and management of implicit knowledge from databases; it will provide support to Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining tasks that can guide the decision-making process, with special focus on environmental databases. The first stage of the project is to develop a prototype of the tool."
