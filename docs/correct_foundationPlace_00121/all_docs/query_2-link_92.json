That’s right. You read correctly – more than double.\n\nIn fact, there has never been a demographic cohort of this size in recorded history. What are the strategic implications of so many people ‘retiring’ (I say this – tongue-in-cheek) all at once? Before we address this question, it is important to examine the impact that Baby Boomers have already had on the global economy.\n\nA Quick Primer on North American Birth Rates\n\nIn North America, family size increased sharply throughout the period commonly known as the baby boom with the average woman bearing 3.09 children in 1950 which increased to 3.65 children per family by 1960. The peak was in 1957, when the figure stood at 3.77. Most couples became pregnant with their first child within seven months of their wedding; between 1940 to 1960, the number of families with three children doubled and the number of families having a fourth child quadrupled.\n\nA Rising Tide Lifts All Boats\n\nSo what does this mean for you and I? Well for starters, if you want to understand how important the Baby Boomers are to the global economy, you simply need to look at the past. Case in point: Because there were so many of them, when the Baby Boomers themselves began to have their own children, they and their children generated a tidal wave of aggregate demand that fuelled the growth of the global economy.\n\nThe demand for durable goods (i.e. appliances, cars, furniture, houses, and personal computers etc) sky-rocketed – as did the stocks of such firms as Apple, McDonalds, Microsoft, Sears, Winnebago, and yes, even foundering Chrysler whom by 1980 was near insolvency with its CEO Lee Iacocca working for a symbolic $1/year as he slashed thousands of jobs and sold off divisions at Chrysler in order to finance the design and production of a vehicle that would save Chrysler – the mini van.\n\nIacocca understood the power of demographics and knew that the Baby Boomers needed something larger than a 5-passenger sedan to ferry their children to gymnastics, hockey and soccer practice – and he was right! In 1984 Chrysler sold 209,895 Dodge Caravans and Chrysler Magic Wagons. While all this was happening the Baby Boomers poured trillions of dollars into Wall Street and their private retirement plans – further fuelling the economy.\n\nLow Tide – All Good Things Come to an End\n\nIn the same way that the Baby Boomers and their children were ‘good news’ for global business, their impending ‘retirement’ (again, tongue-in-cheek) presents a challenge – not only for the global economy, but for governments who are now in the unenviable position of having to fund the sky-rocketing health care costs of ageing Baby Boomers – most of whom, despite having drank and smoked too much, are nonetheless living longer than their parents – puting significant financial pressure on publicly-funded health care.\n\nWith the number of Baby Boomers aged 65-years and over set to more than double by 2018, they will, as they did in the 1970s and 1980s act as a demographic cohort does – that is, they will, on average, all act in the same way as consumers who are at similar stages in their life cycle – only this time instead of consuming, their main focus will be on divesting – that is, listing for sale all those large, 2-storey homes in the suburbs. I say ‘listing’ instead of ‘selling’ because in order to sell something, one actually needs a buyer – and the sheer number of homes that will be listed on the market within the next 5 – 10 years will be enough to drive average house prices down – significantly.\n\nWhy is that – you ask? For the simple reason that the under-employment, unemployment, high student loans, and high debt/disposable incomes of Generation X (i.e. the children of the Baby Boomers) and their subsequent children: Gen Y, and Millennials will preclude them from being in a position to pay current market prices for all the Baby Boomers’ homes when they are listed for sale.\n\nIt’s the Law of Supply and Demand – in this case – too much supply and not enough demand equals (much) lower housing prices. Now stop and think of what (much) lower housing prices will mean to municipalities whose costs have sky-rocketed since federal and provincial downloading became a reality in 1995? While Market Value Assessment seemed to be a panacea to municipalities’ dwindling tax coffers in 1995, what will municipalities do when housing prices are dragged (much) lower, and therefore municipal real estate tax roles also begin to decline – dramatically?\n\nWhat is the Future of the Global Economy?\n\nNo doubt, those Baby Boomers who did contribute to private pension and retirement plans will begin pulling trillions of dollars out of their plans to fund the next 30 or so years of their lives in ‘retirement’ (yes, tongue still firmly planted in cheek). Just as trillions of dollars flowed into these private pension plans fuelled economic expansion in the 1970s and 1980s, so will the withdrawal of trillions of dollars from these private pension and retirement plans cause a further drag on the economy. Sadly, it’s the perfect storm. I say ‘storm’ because the Baby Boomers are expected to live longer than their parents – the effect of which will be a strain on an already strained (Canadian) public health care system. This will translate into higher taxes for Gen X’s, Y’s, and Millennials, or reduced (Provincial) health care coverage.\n\nWho Can Afford to Retire?\n\nThe percentage of Baby Boomers who contributed to private pension plans is less than one-third. Meaning, that two-thirds of North Americans will be relying on Social Security (in the US) and Old Age Security (in Canada). It is worth noting that the maximum monthly Old Age Security benefit (regardless of marital status) in Canada is $564 ($1,200 for surviving spouses). Aside from the demands on Old Age Security that ‘retired’ Baby Boomers will have, how will they survive on as little as $564/month?\n\nIt’s Not All Bad News\n\nIt is important to note that the peak of the retirement age for the Baby Boomer cohort isn’t all bad news. In fact, aging Baby Boomers will be a boon to several market segments – namely:\n\nHealthcare (i.e. everything from Personal Support Workers, Nurses, Doctors and Surgeons);\n\nHome Concierge Services (i.e. grocery & prescription medicine delivery and personal shopping);\n\nHome Maintenance (i.e. rain gutter cleaning, window washing, lawn services, snow removal);\n\nEntertainment (i.e. 1950’s & 1960’s themed live theatre & music); and\n\nTravel (especially sight-seeing day trips).\n\nIt is for the aforementioned reasons that I state that businesses and governments ignore demographics at their own peril.\n\nAndrew Schaer, MBA is a 2010 Postgraduate of Edinburgh Business School – the Graduate School of Business of Heriot-Watt University.\n\nStrategic Planning has to be the most misunderstood amongst all business disciplines – with the word ‘Strategic’ being the most misused – often to bolster what amounts to elevator analysis (i.e. a phenomenon where the analyst describes simply how an elevator goes up and down, but is silent on which floors the elevator is most often required, when and by whom).\n\nAsk most MBAs to whom do they most attribute the greatest contribution to modern Strategic Planning and you’ll get a range of responses including:\n\nMichael Porter;\n\nHenry Mintzberg;\n\nAlfred Chandler, Jr.; AND\n\nIgor Ansoff.\n\nVery rarely do we hear of Dan E. Schendel and his invaluable contribution to Strategic Planning known as the Functional Process Model and its expanded form known as the Augmented Process Model. Mr. Schendel is a Blake Family Endowed Chair Emeritus in Strategic Management at the Krannert Graduate School of Management, Purdue University, in addition to being a Strategic Management Society Fellow.\n\nThe Functional Process Model is a step-based method of Strategic Planning which guides the strategist through the planning process – ensuring that the type, scope and breadth of analysis conducted is structured and sufficient to provide management with the underpinnings of a plan worthy of being called strategic.\n\nIt begins by examining the structure of the firm, the style and type of strategist, his/her aversion to risk, the composition of the firm’s management team, and the firm’s group dynamics.\n\nNext the business objectives are examined from the standpoint of the business definition, mission statement, shareholder wealth, gap analysis, means and ends analysis, ethics, profit maximization, an analysis of how growth will be achieved, and an analysis of the firm’s stakeholders based on their influence and importance to the firm’s success.\n\nAnalysis & Diagnosis of the macro and industry environment, the firm’s internal factors and competitive position are then conducted. It is this analysis that is too often not conducted in the majority of so-called strategic plans (primarily because it requires a lot of work!) – and at the peril of the strategist or client (see the Principal-Agent Problem).\n\nOnce the Analysis & Diagnosis is complete, the strategy choices emerge (those which are suitable, given the internal/external conditions identified by the analysis & diagnosis). Generic Strategy Alternatives (i.e. Stability, Expansion, Retrenchment, Combination, Differentiation, Focus, and Segmentation) are examined and that which best suits the firm’s internal/external environment is selected and further developed.\n\nNext, Strategy Variations are examined: diversification (related and unrelated), vertical integration, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances, and an examination of the firm’s pricing strategy (e.g. leadership, limit, predatory) is conducted.\n\nThe choice of strategy is further predicated on risk analysis, managerial perceptions, financial (net present value) analysis of the firm’s investment alternatives (usually capital expenditures), how familiar the firm is with a given product market, scenarios, and a host of analysis including break even, payback, sensitivity analysis, SWOT analysis, and game theory (e.g. how the competition is likely to respond to the firm’s change in strategy). Again, strategic planning is not for the faint of heart and requires a lot of work!\n\nThe Implementation phase is characterized by further analysis of the firm’s resources and structure, how can resources best be allocated, and the system of evaluation and control which will be used to implement the plan.\n\nThe final step of the Strategic Planning Process is (again – often misunderstood and not properly carried out) Feedback which is a continuous closed process loop – reverting back to strategist – found at the beginning of the strategic planning process. Why? Because strategic planning is a constant on-going process that, contrary to what most so-called ‘strategists’ will tell you, does not end with the printing, distribution and display of the strategic plan on management’s bookcase. It is a living, breathing document requiring constant updating in response to changes in the external environment.\n\nWith that, I will leave you, the reader, with an often quoted strategic planning adage: failing to plan is planning to fail.\n\nAndrew Schaer, MBA is a 2010 Postgraduate of Edinburgh Business School – the Graduate School of Business of Heriot-Watt University.\n\nSince the forced sales of former U.S. investment banking giants Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, and Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, and the spectacular collapse of Lehman Brothers, two fundamental questions have remained unanswered:\n\nWhat was the root cause of this spectacular industry (and economic) failure?\n\nWhat can be done to prevent it from happening again?\n\nAt the turn of the century, a key U.S. policy shift led to legislation which relaxed mortgage qualification rules for prospective U.S. home-buyers. Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM) were popular with home-buyers who were attracted to their low initial interest rates. However, as the unintended consequence of this shift in policy fuelled the now infamous U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis, resulted in the spectacular failures of three Wall Street investment banking giants, the failure of California based IndyMac Bank, and U.S. mortgage underwriting giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and eventually required the U.S. Federal Reserve to engage in aggressive Quantitative Easing – forcing the Fed to buy and hold in excess of $2 Trillion in bank debt, mortgage-backed securities, and treasury notes. Suddenly, the U.S. taxpayer was unwillingly thrust into the sub-prime mortgage underwriting business.\n\nAs ARM mortgage lenders’ cost of funds rose, borrowers found themselves unable to refinance at the higher interest rates and mortgage defaults ensued. What started out as a misdiagnosed case of the financial sniffles quickly evolved and spread into a financial and economic flu of pandemic proportions as many of the G8 central banks scrambled to implement multi-billion dollar economic stimulus packages. However, much like any over-the-counter cold remedy that simply targets the symptoms of a cold instead of the curing the cold itself, these economic stimulus packages were largely ineffective.\n\nFive years would pass before the Obama Administration would come to the realization that throwing money at a problem doesn’t solve the problem – the root cause of which was the failure of the system of internal corporate governance and risk management oversight.\n\nDespite the mass media’s reputation for chasing and sensationalizing a story – all in the pursuit of ratings, not one analyst, reporter, or news anchor asked: “Where in all of this were the respective Directors of these Wall Street firms’ Boards? Were the systems of internal corporate governance of these public companies working properly? Whose responsibility was it to oversee management and traders whose own incentive plans actually encouraged them to take on unacceptable levels of risk?”\n\nThis was particularly alarming since according to its 2008 Annual Report, Lehman Brothers boasted of having ‘a culture of risk management at every level of the firm’. If that were in fact true, where was Lehman Brothers’ Board of Directors when the firm’s leverage ratio (calculated as Total Assets divided by Shareholders’ Equity) rose from 26:1 in the comparatively stable market of 2006, to over 30:1 in the volatile market since Q4 of 2007?\n\nIn order to answer these salient questions we need only look to the U.S. public company financial accounting restatement scandals of 2001 – 2003 (during which time a staggering 346 U.S. publicly traded firms were caught fudging their financial statements), where risk management (an essential element of corporate governance) took a back seat to individual and corporate greed. I say this, with the full knowledge that as a former Investment Banker, the more assets one has under one’s management, the more money one can make from them – and the larger one’s personal bonus at the end of the year. This was further facilitated by 13 years of loose monetary policy of then U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, whom, despite his now infamous “irrational exuberance“ comment on the U.S. capital markets during the dot-com bubble, Greenspan counter-intuitively continued to flood the U.S. economy with cheap money – tantamount to spiking the economic punch bowl. It was quite a party!\n\nRisk Management Oversight\n\nPrior to its collapse, Lehman Brothers, like Bear Stearns, used a risk management system called Value At Risk (VAR) – a method developed in the 1990s by JPMorgan Chase (who ironically ended up owning Bear Stearns following its collapse). VAR was Wall Street’s risk management methodology of choice because it didn’t hamstring traders. In reality, however, it provided management and (assuming they were performing their risk management oversight duties) the Board of Directors with the impression that risk management was being employed, but without providing any visibility into the nature or level of risks assumed by management and traders.\n\nVAR requires a number of assumptions (which, as it turns out, are all completely fallacious) and then provides for a 99% confidence limit of a given loss that may be incurred by each trading position – at worst – 1% of the time. This is usually done by modelling the price behaviour or standard deviation from the mean of a financial instrument’s price curve. A standard deviation of ‘1’ would reflect the normal market volatility on average for a given financial instrument. Less than ‘1’ being less risky than the market on average, and more than ‘1’ being more risky than the market on average. However, a major problem with this method is that it doesn’t show what can happen to the price of an instrument the other 1% of the time (i.e. when the VAR limit is exceeded).\n\nThe Basel II Accord (which governs the activities of the world’s banks) recommends a “conservative use of VAR in measuring risk” – and for good reason, as when VAR is used to model monthly price changes, the result can be disastrous. For example: ‘100’ months equates to 8.33 years, and anyone who paid attention in math class knows that 1% is the same as 1 out of 100. Suddenly the prospect of becoming insolvent every 8.33 years (i.e. 1% of the time) isn’t so attractive, is it? Yet that’s exactly the level of risk that Wall Street investment banks were taking with investors’ money.\n\nHow VAR takes into account volatility is another one of its drawbacks. When markets are stable, VAR assesses the risk as ‘low’ thereby encouraging traders to increase their positions of a respective financial instrument. However, in declining or unstable markets, it’s often difficult to profitably sell-off a trader’s positions. If these positions are large enough (as was the case with Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch), the result is a financial sector meltdown which raises counter-party risk amongst the world’s banks and other global financial market participants. In fact, that’s precisely what happened in early September 2008 when suddenly the world’s banks had no idea which of them were holding these worthless mortgage-backed securities, and so they stopped lending to each other. Like most pandemics, this financial flu spread rapidly throughout the world’s inter-connected financial markets – affecting everything from the amount of money that the pubic markets had previously made available to allow consumers to lease new vehicles (at a time when 70% of new car sales were leased and not bank financed), to financing facilities formerly available to large corporations. The party was over, a global financial crisis ensued, and banking changed forever.\n\nA further problem using VAR is magnified when leverage (i.e. borrowing against an asset) is taken into account, as the normal or accepted leverage for Wall Street firms at the time was 20:1. However, this level was traditionally subject to interpretation by firms who viewed the subordinated debt of a firm as equivalent to a firm’s equity (which it most certainly is not). So, while this 20:1 leverage ratio appeared to be acceptable when an investment banking firm’s assets consisted of commercial paper, bonds and shares – all of which can be easily valued and can be more readily sold on the stock market should the need arise, such a high leverage ratio is unacceptable when an investment banking firm’s asset mix includes investments in real estate, private equity, hedge fund positions, credit default swaps (CDS) and other derivative positions that did not even appear on these firms’ balance sheets.\n\nIncreasing from leverage of 20:1 to over 30:1 (as Lehman Brothers did), was, at best, imprudent, and at worst, reckless, as even where off-balance-sheet credit default swaps and other derivatives weren’t the source of the problem, at the time, structured investment vehicles (SIV) were not required to be reflected on the investment banks’ balance sheets. More importantly (as Lehman Brothers discovered), an institution that is leveraged 30:1 needs only to see a decline of 3.3% in the value of its assets before its capital is entirely wiped out. Even where some of these assets are ‘zero-risk’ treasuries, a 3.3% decline can result from a 10% decline in the value of one-third of the firm’s assets.\n\nSadly, Lehman Brothers’ high leverage was not unique amongst Wall Street’s investment banks. According to the balance sheets of its competitors, while Lehman Brothers’ leverage had been reduced to roughly 23:1 through asset sales, Morgan Stanley’s was still 30:1, Goldman Sachs’ was 24:1, and Merrill Lynch’s leverage ratio was an alarming 44:1 (i.e. requiring a decline in the value of its assets of only 2.27% before its capital was entirely wiped out).\n\nThe lesson here? If global financial markets are to avoid a crisis of similar magnitude, legislation governing the leverage that such firms are permitted to employ and requiring the Boards of Directors of public companies to take an active role in risk management oversight is required. Otherwise, the world’s major economies will continue on their current path of privatizing industry profits while socializing (through tax-payer funded bailouts) industry failures.\n\nAndrew Schaer, MBA (Hons Corporate Governance) is a 2010 Postgraduate of Edinburgh Business School – the Graduate School of Business of Heriot-Watt University."
