The ever growing availability of data, along with expanding computing power and tools, opens the door to businesses gaining competitive advantage through analytical processes and skill.\n\nJack Levis, senior director of process management at UPS, will share his experiences and best practices to compete with analytics, requiring organizational support in the form of data, tools and senior management commitment. Analytics takes the general forms of:\n\nDescriptive analytics – Analysis of historical data\n\nPredictive analytics – Prediction of probabilities of future trends\n\nPrescriptive analytics – Evaluate new ways to operate\n\nUPS has gone through a long evolution in moving up this analytical hierarchy which required organizational commitment and significant process change. While many lessons were learned along the way, the end result has been reduced cost, improved service to customers, and a data driven architecture for the future.\n\nThis presentation will show how UPS built upon a culture of engineering and quantitative analysis. Those core competencies are the foundation of systems reengineering efforts that use advanced analytics and connected devices. Examples of the changed processes will be presented as well as lessons learned from the journey.\n\nJack Levis\n\nSenior Director, Process Management\n\nUPS\n\n9:40-10:00am • Room: Salon A5\n\nDiamond Sponsor Presentation\n\nAnalytics Everywhere and For Everyone\n\nOver the past 5 years we have seen the redefinition of the economics of storing data, the proliferation of self-service data preparation and visualization and now we are starting to see the beginnings of automated analytics and the Internet of Things. Certainly there are many converging trends and numerous buzzwords to accompany and lead those trends. We will discuss all of these and how you can play a role in a making sense of them, leveraging them to your benefit and how analytics can help drive effectiveness and efficiency in your operations, marketing, manufacturing, governance, logistics and more.\n\nJohn Thompson\n\nGeneral Manager for Advanced Analytics\n\nDell Software\n\n10:00-10:30am • Room: Salon A Prefunction\n\nExhibits & Morning Coffee Break\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n10:30-11:15am • Room: Salon A2\n\nTrack 1: Analytics Tools\n\nForrester's Review Of 12+ Predictive Analytics Tools\n\nThere is no \"best\" tool for predictive analytics. It depends on the skill level of the data scientist (or business analyst) and the breadth and depth of business use cases. In fact, data scientists often draw from multiple tools depending upon the job at hand. In this session, Forrester analysts Mike Gualtieri and Rowan Curran will present their in-depth analysis of more than 12 predictive analytics tools including: Alpine Data Labs, Alteryx, Angoss, Dell (Statistica), FICO, IBM, Knime, Microsoft (Azure Machine Learning), Oracle, RapidMiner, SAP, SAS, and others. Attend this session to understand the sweetspot for each of these tools and how to evaluate and choose the best tools for your situation and needs.\n\nRowan Curran\n\nResearcher\n\nForrester Research\n\n10:30-11:15am • Room: Salon A5\n\nTrack 2: Online Marketing\n\nCase Study: SmarterHQ\n\nThe Revolution in Retail Customer Intelligence\n\nIn this new era of Big Data, retailers collect data in ever-increasing volume and variety. In the midst of Big Data, a revolution is taking place in how retailers gain insights about customers, whether they interact with the brand online, in stores, or both. This session will describe the transition from reporting to data-driven decisions using predictive analytics. Success requires collecting the right data, creating informative derived attributes, making this data accessible in a timely manner, and building predictive models. Examples, drawn from real-world retailers, will include shopping cart funnel management, shopping cart abandonment, marketing attribution, churn, and purchase propensity.\n\nAlso sign up for a one-day workshop by Dean Abbott:\n\nAdvanced Methods Hands-on: Predictive Modeling Techniques\n\nSupercharging Prediction: Hands-On with Ensemble Models\n\nDean Abbott\n\nCo-Founder and Chief Data Scientist\n\nSmarterHQ\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n10:30-10:50am • Room: Mobley\n\nTrack 3: Sales Management\n\nCase Study: Paychex\n\nShaping Sales Strategy with Predictive Analytics\n\nPredictive modeling brings art and science together and without it many strategic decisions are left to instinct. This can lead to missed opportunities in the age of big data. Paychex leveraged expertise in Predictive Analytics to add an empirical layer to sales strategy decisions. With the addition of models to predict likely sales units and establish a yardstick to measure sales value by zip code, sales management became statistically informed as they made decisions regarding quota setting, territory alignment and market expansion. This session describes how Predictive Analytics at Paychex was granted a seat at the strategic table.\n\nPhilip O'Brien\n\nMIS and Portfolio Manager\n\nPaychex\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n10:55-11:15am • Room: Mobley\n\nTrack 3: Credit Scoring\n\nCase Study: Mimoni (Latin America lender)\n\nUsing Predictive Models to Provide More Favorable Short-Term Credit Solutions for the Unbanked\n\nFor the millions of Latin Americans lacking a bank account, credit card, or significant credit history, fulfilling urgent credit needs often requires the use of pawn shops and very high-interest payroll deduction loans. Launched in Mexico in late 2013, Mimoni has used repayment, operations, and customer communication data to successfully develop predictive models of consumer behavior and repayment, helping them become the leading online lender for the unbanked in Latin America. In this session, we review Mimoni\\'s application of predictive analytics in different aspects of the business, and their evolution going forward.\n\nCarlos Soltero\n\nHead of Analytics and Software Development\n\nMimoni\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n11:20am-12:05pm • Room: Salon A2\n\nTrack 1: Political Campaigning\n\nCase Study: Bruning for Governor Campaign\n\nCampaigning with Predictive Analytics\n\nUsing Predictive Analytics and Data Science, we are going to show you how to help political campaigns win their race by providing campaigns information at the individual level using models that predict voter turnout, issue support, and candidate support.\n\nOur case study for this session is a recent Nebraska Gubernatorial primary race where we were able to predict overall voter turnout to within 0.2% (637 votes) and the final voter count for our candidate to within 2% (1,676 votes).\n\nNathan Watson\n\nPresident\n\nContemporary Analysis Inc. (CAN)\n\n11:20am-12:05pm • Room: Salon A5\n\nTrack 2: Workforce Analytics\n\nCase Study: An Organization's Sales Force\n\nTime Series Clustering to Predict Sales Representative Growth, Performance, and Gaming\n\nIn the search for quality sales representatives, it is tempting to think that there is one successful \"type\" of rep. In fact, the data in this study suggest that there are multiple pathways of sales achievement. In this study we put aside simple aggregations to do it the \"hard way\" - by modeling low-level sales transactions. Using big data technologies, we analyzed millions of geo-located sales records for thousands of national sales reps. The analysis revealed several well-traveled pathways - some hit the ground running, some were gradual learners but eventually excelled, some gamed the system to win, many others failed.\n\nPasha Roberts\n\nCo-Founder and Chief Scientist\n\nTalent Analytics, Corp.\n\n11:20am-12:05pm • Room: Mobley\n\nTrack 3: Customer Experience Management and Risk Mitigation\n\nCase Studies: CFPB, CapOne, Citibank, and BoA\n\nFortune Tellers Need Not Apply: Leveraging Predictive Analytics and Big Data to Mitigate Emerging Risks and Improve Customer Experience\n\nAcross all of today's various business industries, data continues to play an increasingly important role in driving educated decisions, improving customer experience and maintaining success. The question plaguing many businesses, however, is how to use available data to mitigate emerging risks and customer complaints. Based on continual in-depth analyses of the CFPB's consumer complaint database, Steven Ramirez, CEO of Beyond the Arc, will discuss:\n\nHow to utilize big data to predict customer issues\n\nThe risks and threats of ignoring complaints\n\nBest practices for analyzing social media and customer feedback to identify and address potential issues\n\nSteven Ramirez\n\nCEO\n\nBeyond the Arc\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n12:05-1:30pm • Room: Salon A Prefunction\n\nLunch in Exhibit Hall\n\n1:30-2:15pm • Room: Salon A5\n\nKeynote\n\nThe Balance Between Science and Practical Decision Making\n\nAs companies embrace the possibility of mounds of data turning into nuggets of gold- like diamonds in a coal mine- they face practical issues in extracting value out of powerful scientific theories. Data scientists by training often live in a world of facts, black and white and espouse a paradigm that is often not shared by business leaders that have grown up in a data and fact starved world. How does one make the transition from pure science to practical value in a way that drives sustainable transformation across a business and beyond the narrow confines of predictive analytics groups. How do you influence the current culture in a way that is both productive and empowering? This session focuses on the journey towards sustainable transformation with practical learning's and insights that are valuable to both the practitioner and aspiring leaders.\n\nRajeeve Kaul\n\nSenior Vice President\n\nOfficeMax\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n2:15-2:30pm • Room: Salon A5\n\nLightning Round\n\n2:40-3:00pm • Room: Salon A2\n\nTrack 1: Data Asset Management\n\nStrategies for Monetizing Big Data through Digital Platforms\n\nWe will examine how leading firms are developing dominant digital platforms for the creation of data assets. In many ways, the formation of data assets is a byproduct of other businesses. A car manufacture, for instance, installs a computer in a car to make it operate better, but the data generated by the computer on performance and use of the car is valuable to insurers and even municipalities. It creates opportunities, possibly, to sell or trade the data, which this session will explore.\n\nRussell Walker\n\nClinical Associate Professor\n\nKellogg School of Management\n\n2:40-3:25pm • Room: Salon A5\n\nTrack 2: Hiring and Recruiting\n\nCase Study: The Data Incubator\n\nData-Driven Hiring of Data Scientists\n\nHiring- even for data scientists- is often not very data driven. At The Data Incubator, we run a fellowship to train and place data scientists in industry, regularly receiving over 1000 applications per session. To cope, we rely on robust analytics and machine-learning for our admissions process to ensure we are finding the best talent for our hiring partner companies. We'll explain why most traditional keyword-driven screening processes do not work for finding data science talent and how to both streamline and build an automated data-driven screening processes that filters for skills and talent, not keywords and hype.\n\nMichael Li\n\nCEO\n\nThe Data Incubator\n\n2:40-3:00pm • Room: Mobley\n\nTrack 3: Marketing; Advanced Methods\n\nCase Study: A Financial Creditor\n\nWhat Landing a Rover on Mars Taught us about Optimization of Marketing Strategies for Loan Portfolios\n\nAnalytical Mechanics Associates delivers big data analysis and predictive modeling for NASA to optimize trajectories and fuel consumption during flight. The chief constraint is mission success in all atmospheric and interplanetary conditions. The techniques developed and used by aerospace engineers (a.k.a. rocket scientists) are used by businesses to optimize marketing decisions with the chief constraint of being profitable in all economic and market conditions.

Discovering a community in a social network is to detect a cluster of social members whose rate of interactions among those members is higher than of those outside of the social cluster. This talk will survey and highlight the present state of the art algorithms that are widely used in this space with a specific focus on biologically inspired techniques (Clustering Algorithms inspired from the natural bird flocking behavior - FlockbyLeader algorithm for community detection, and ant colonies for recommender systems) It is important to note that most of the major vendors of predictive analytics do not include biologically inspired algorithms in their suite of algorithms.\n\nAnasse Bari\n\nVisiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science\n\nGeorge Washington University\n\nMohamed Chaouchi\n\nIT Manager\n\nU.S. Census Bureau\n\n10:00-10:45am • Room: Salon A5\n\nTrack 2: Uplift Modeling\n\nCase Study: Telenor\n\nApplying Next Generation Uplift Modeling to Optimize Customer Retention Programs\n\nOrganizations must constantly work to drive greater retention and revenue whilst spending less money and using fewer resources. In this session, hear how the world's 7th largest mobile operator has applied next generation \"uplift\" modeling (i.e. \"net lift\" modeling) to optimize retention programs and seen results 36% better than those possible using traditional analytic practices. Impressively, these results were reached while, at the same time, slashing the cost of retention programs by a staggering 40%  making this an ideal fit for today's recessionary marketing requirements.\n\nUplift models are different from traditional modeling in that the approach measures and predicts the true incremental impact of marketing activity. Whereas traditional models only aim to predict \"behavior\", uplift models actually predict the incremental \"change in behavior.\" Telenor's novel approach and application was recently featured in Forrester Research's popular new report \"Optimizing Customer Retention Programs\", where the approach was shown to achieve an 11-fold increase in campaign ROI when compared with existing programs.\n\nDr. Patrick Surry\n\nChief Data Scientist\n\nHopper\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n10:45-11:15am • Room: Salon A Prefunction\n\nExhibits & Morning Coffee Break\n\n11:15am-12:00pm • Room: Salon A2\n\nTrack 1: Price Prediction\n\nCase Study: Hopper\n\nBuy or Wait? How the Bunny Predicts When to Buy Your Plane Ticket\n\nBuying a plane ticket is a time-consuming and frustrating process that often leaves the consumer unhappy. Flight prices are less transparent and fluctuate more than almost anything else a consumer buys, even though airfare is one of the most expensive purchases for a typical family. On average, consumers spend almost two weeks comparison shopping but end up spending nearly 5% more than when they started looking. Ironically, all the variability in prices means that there are good deals to be found, but consumers lose out because they're only spot-checking prices occasionally. By watching continuously there's often a 5-10% lower price even within 24 hours, and the potential for further savings by picking the best time to buy.\n\nOur goal at Hopper is to bring more transparency to pricing, by giving consumers advice about where and when to fly -- and when to buy -- to save money on their air travel. We believe this helps consumers buy more quickly, with less effort, and ultimately be happier with their purchase decision. One of our key features is our \"when to buy\" advice: we'll watch prices for your trip continuously and alert you when we think you should buy. The question is what makes a good deal? If we're too conservative and tell you to buy too early, we risk missing out on a better deal later, but if we're too optimistic and wait too long, you could end up paying more as prices rise towards your departure date. Because prices change in unpredictable ways, at the whim of the airlines, it's impossible to know for sure. But this session will outline the predictive approaches we use to make recommendations that save about 10% on average, and up to 40% in some cases.\n\nDr. Patrick Surry\n\nChief Data Scientist\n\nHopper\n\n11:15am-12:00pm • Room: Salon A5\n\nTrack 2: Advanced Methods\n\nThe Holy Grail of Improving Modeling Performance (Math or Data)\n\nMuch of the analytics literature tends to focus on math and its potential to improve modeling lift. In this session, various mathematical techniques are explored across a variety of industries ranging from financial services, insurance, etc. in order to determine if certain techniques are more appropriate under certain conditions or industries. Yet, what about data. For example, do certain categories of data yield better modeling lift in certain industries or perhaps by model type such as retention vs. acquisition? The objective of this session is to provide practitioners with insight on how to better focus their efforts on improving modeling lift.\n\nRichard Boire\n\nFounding Partner\n\nBoire Filler Group\n\n[ Top of this page ] [ Agenda overview ]\n\n12:00-1:15pm • Room: Salon A Prefunction\n\nLunch in Exhibit Hall\n\n1:15-2:00pm • Room: Salon A5\n\nSpecial Plenary Session\n\nTop Five Technical Tricks to Try when Trapped\n\nThere's no better source for tricks of the analytics trade than Dr. John Elder, the established industry leader renowned as an acclaimed training workshop instructor and author -- and well-known for his \"Top 10 Data Mining Mistakes\" and advanced methods like Target Shuffling.
