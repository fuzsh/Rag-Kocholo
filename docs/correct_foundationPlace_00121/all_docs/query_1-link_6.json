        "text": "ProphetStor joins new Ceph Foundation to manage the massive growth in data and information generated from cloud, container and AI applications\n\nProphetStor Data Services Inc, a leading AIOps company, co-founds a new foundation in conjunction with over 30 global technology leaders to support Ceph open source project community. The Ceph project develops a unified distributed storage system providing applications with object, block, and file system interfaces.\n\n“Today’s launch of the Ceph Foundation is a testament to the strength of a diverse open source community coming together to address the explosive growth in data storage and services,” said Sage Weil, Ceph co-creator, project leader, and chief architect at Red Hat for Ceph.\n\n“Ceph is the future of storage. We at ProphetStor are proud to have contributed our machine learning technology to its community to help bring it to the forefront of the storage industry,” said Jeremy Wei, Vice President of Corporate Business Development.\n\nRead More: Interview with Ben Goertzel, CEO at SingularityNET\n\nFounding Premier members of Ceph Foundation include ProphetStor Data Services, Amihan, Canonical, China Mobile, DigitalOcean, Intel, OVH, Red Hat, SoftIron, SUSE, Western Digital, XSKY Data Technology, and ZTE. The Ceph Foundation will organize and distribute financial contributions in a coordinated, vendor-neutral fashion for immediate community benefit. This will help galvanize rapid adoption, training and in-person collaboration across the Ceph ecosystem.\n\nCeph is used by cloud providers and enterprises around the world, including financial institutions (Bloomberg, Fidelity), cloud service providers (Rackspace, Linode), academic and government institutions (Massachusetts Open Cloud), telecommunications infrastructure providers (Deutsche Telekom), auto manufacturers (BMW), software solution providers (SAP, Salesforce), and many more.\n\nRead More: Palo Alto Networks Appoints Amit K. Singh as President\n\nCeph is also used by Rook, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project that brings seamless provisioning of file, block and object storage services into the Kubernetes environment, running the Ceph storage infrastructure in containers alongside applications that are consuming that storage.\n\nThe growth of new cloud, container and artificial intelligence/machine learning applications are driving increased use of Ceph. For example, Ceph combined with analytics and machine learning enables enterprises to comb through mass amounts of unstructured data to quickly spot patterns with customer behavior, online customer conversations and potential noncompliance scenarios. At Ceph Day Berlin, ProphetStor also showcases “DiskProphet®”, a disk health prediction technology for Ceph by using machine learning, as well as “Project Alameda”, an open source providing predictive analytics to support Rook’s intelligent resource orchestration."
