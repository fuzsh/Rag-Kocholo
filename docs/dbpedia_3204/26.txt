Critical response

Ash Brown of Manga Bookshelf reviewed the manga's first three volume. He praised the artwork and called it more polished but criticized the story for being simple and lacking character development.[48] Jarred Pine of Anime on DVD praised the first volume's packaging but criticized the story, stating: "Saiyuki Reload so far seems to have lost a lot of its charm and magic, relying much more on posing bishies and their oozing cool guy attitudes rather than crafting interesting stories to tell".[49] Michael Deeley of Manga Life liked the premise and Art styles, liked how the art "switches from a realistic to cartoony style in the moment of action" and described the manga as "a good balance of action and drama" that is "bipolar, an action-comedy, one part and the other part is dark and dour".[2]

Publishers Weekly praised the protagonists, calling them likeable and enjoyable for new readers, stating: "with a winning combination of charming heroes, clever dialogue, great fight scenes and engaging stories, Reload is solid entertainment all the way".[50] Manga News gave an Average score to the first three volumes of the series, stating Sayuki Reload had moved away from the original plan and could not function as smoothly as the first series.[51][52][53] Later volumes were awarded High score and praised.[54][55][56][57][58][59][60]

M. Natali of Bd Gest gave a three-out-of-five score to the third volume, describing the story as more-or-less skillful in setting up and delving into the past of Sanzo's character, and the unusual aspect of the main characters, who have become "bad boys with attitude", which he found to be one of the series' strengths.[61] Nicolas Demay of Planete BD described the series as having "very interesting cuts and selected shots are cinematic" but he criticized volume 6, calling it "a transition volume that isn't really gripping".[62][63]

It started in the magazine's first issue (May issue) of 2002 (cover date May 1),[4][5][6][7][8] which was released on March 28.[9][10]
