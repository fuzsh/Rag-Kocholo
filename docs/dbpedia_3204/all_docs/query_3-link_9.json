        "text": "About the Saiyuki Original Series Resurrected Hardcover Manga Volume 1\n\nThe boys are back, in 400-page hardcovers that are as pretty and badass as they are! This hit adventure - which blends mythology from around the world into a classic adventure story - has been out of print for years, and this collector's edition is a fitting celebration of its return! Genjo is a Buddhist priest in the city of Shangri-La, which is being ravaged by yokai spirits that have fallen out of balance with the natural order. His superiors send him on a journey far to the west to discover why this is happening and how to stop it. His companions are three yokai with human souls. But this is no day trip-the four will encounter many discoveries and horrors on the way, and on the road, Genjo will wonderâ€¦can he really trust his supernatural companions?"
