        "text": "If he has to go to class today, if he has to sit at his desk and be humiliated period after period by teacher after teacher?\n\nIf he has to deal with getting hit or chased or sneered at …\n\nIf he has to hear even one person call him Dame-Tsuna today …\n\nWell.\n\nIf Tsuna has to deal with any of that today he might just burn it all down.\n\n“So,” Yaomomo breaks the silence, “I feel as if we’re all aware of what we need to address.”\n\n“You mean the fact that Sensei thinks he’s gonna be able to get rid of us once we graduate?” Hitoshi pipes up from where he’s laying across Izuku and Shōto’s laps.\n\n“Indeed,” Tenya says, tellingly subdued. “I’m surprised he made such an illogical leap. It’s unlike Aizawa-sensei. Perhaps he’s ill?”\n\nWhenever the topic of babies and families comes up, it’s just one of those conversations he’s still regularly excluded from. Not out of any real intent to be hateful, but more because everyone else is always so certain that they already know what his opinion on the subject is going to be.\n\nBecause, no matter how much has changed, some part of Naruto will, apparently, always be that same loud, rough idiot he used to be in the heads and hearts of the people he loves.\n\nIt stings a little, Naruto’s willing to admit that to himself and Kurama, but he doesn’t focus on it, doesn’t bother to muster up the energy to complain about it.\n\nIt’s a small hurt after all and he has far fewer of those to deal with these days than he used to.\n\nStill, with all of that taken into account, it’s perfectly understandable in Naruto’s opinion that he goes a little bit insane when Sakura gets pregnant.\n\nShōta slumps his way out of bed, the top sheet draped over his head and clutched together underneath his chin, and drags himself to the kitchen.\n\n“Stop,” Shōta mutters as he does his best to avoid Bastard and Trash as they wind around his ankles, “I coulda dropped my croissant.”\n\nShōta pauses for a split second, something about that sentence not sitting right with him, before he shrugs and continues to ooze his way towards the fresh cup of coffee he knows Hizashi will have waiting for him.\n\nJeralt’s death leaves Byleth a grieving, miserable wreck. To give herself a reason to keep going, she adopts Dimitri, a lonely orphan with a deep-seated sorrow. With each year they spend together, the loneliness in Byleth slowly ebbs away, and she learns to cherish her little family with him.\n\nShe hopes it stays like this.\n\n–\n\nDimitri hopes it stays like this, too.\n\nHe adores his new life and home. But more importantly, he loves Byleth.\n\nAnd only Byleth.\n\nOne for All is a quirk that can be passed on.\n\nWell.\n\nMore like it passes itself on, to whoever within range happens to have the most heroic potential.\n\nWith its Eighth holder, Yagi Toshinori, All Might, gravely injured following a battle with All for One, First decides it's time to choose the Ninth.\n\nHe really didn’t expect that vast heroic spirit to belong to a child, especially one so young that the lines between them... blur.\n\nAlternatively: Midoriya isn't exactly sure what he did, but he's got six ghosts hanging around him and an extra in his brain now. He's not sure how he feels about the spill over from the one he's currently brain buddies with, though.\n\n(Updates Wednesdays!)\n\nOne for All is an interesting quirk, and it allows the user to do a variety of interesting, perhaps even unhuman things.\n\nBut what happens when desperate people mistake the miracles of One for All for the miracles of some minor God? Well, obviously, they plan to push him to become a major one.\n\nI don't really know how to summarise this but uhhh: Deku gets a cult, Deku does not know he has a cult, Mr. conspiracy theorist does, and Aizawa thinks he's finally found All for One."
