It's not as easy as it looks, he discovers Rated NC-17 for smut in later chapters.\n\nAfter the journey ended, the group go on separate ways, everybody is doing great and so they thought.\n\nSanzou had to depend on the others after a fight where he is injured.\n\nThe group learns important lessons on what it means to be human and what it means to be Youkai and why Love is as much a bitter medicine as it is a sweet taste in the mouth.\n\nThe boys make a bet as to who can get Sanzou into bed first. Oh my, whatever will our grouchy Preist do?\n\nSanzou thinks as to the reasons why he never follows through on his death threats directed towards his traveling comapnions.\n\nSanzo and Gojyo are now both aware of their previous life and the promise they made.\n\nThe Ikkou has to stop at a forest and something unexptected happens.\n\nOn a very specific anniversary in Hakkai's life, Gojyo deals with it as best he can. No pairings.\n\nWritten in response to a prompt on the of all places LiveJournal community bleach_contest: harlot. Goku asks a question that isn't quite as innocent as he thought it was."
