        "text": "Story Or Series Title: These Last Moments\n\nFandom: Gensomaden Saiyuki\n\nHidden Author's Name: Illianaka\n\nGenre: Angst/Drama/Romance/Psychological/\n\nRating: PG [Character Death, Language, Shounen-Ai, Spoilers]\n\nSynopsis: Gaiden Spoilers. Based on one of the author's thoughts of how Konzen died. In their final moments together, they made a promise...\n\nWhat's good about it?: This fic has a original idea that I have not seen on other fanfiction before, and like the author has stated, many have written about Goku killing Konzen, but Goku, even when in his demonic form, wouldn't have killed Konzen, because he is the supposedly sun to Goku, the source of life... Yadda.\n\nWhat's bad about it?: The A/N seems a bit too long, but I'm not complaining. She could have placed some separation between the A/N and the actual story.\n\nOther Worthyness: Realistic and absolutely heart-wrenching. One of the few fanfiction I actually really love. The climax is remarkably clear and the ending, though at a cliffhanger, but is sastisfactory for anyone fan who has read the manga.\n\nPlease include a small sample of the best of this story:\n\n\"Come on, you stupid monkey,\" Konzen muttered, glancing elsewhere but leaving his hand extended. When Goku hesitantly clasped it, he pulled the boy forward. Even before he released Goku's hand, the heretic child was twining his arms around Konzen, clinging to him so tightly and desperately.\n\nTo lose each other... Konzen allowed his arm to fall into a comfortable position around the boy's back. Goku's muscles were taut; clearly he was distressed and frightened, no matter how much he tried to hide it. He was still just a child, far more innocent than most his age... even with having to put up with the scorn and fear for being born with golden eyes.\n\nGoku's chains were cold through Konzen's shirt; they pressed into his skin, no more comfortable than the rocks behind him. Konzen grimaced slightly, but put up with it. His amethyst eyes were currently on the boy curled up against him, trailing over the cuts and bruises, over the sickeningly pale skin.\n\nIn a gesture of concern that he wouldn't have displayed under less dramatic circumstances, Konzen brushed the back of his hand against Goku's forehead. The boy was hot, but still experiencing chills. He kept shivering. He wasn't a god, and so could get sick-- which he obviously still was.\n\nTo be sick on top of everything else... the kid must have been miserable. So it took Konzen by surprise when Goku tilted his head up, smiling.\n\n\"You're warm,\" he said. \"Like the sun.\"\n\nLike the sun... that was one of the first things Goku had said to him. At the time he had been commenting on the golden colour of Konzen's hair; he'd been fascinated by it, even daring to reach out and grasp a handful of it-- and accidentally ripping that handful out.\n\nWhat strange dynamics they had. Right from the start, it seemed as though Goku was the type to only grate on Konzen's nerves when in fact, he was the type that Konzen could appreciate the most. He made his boring life more interesting. (Especially now, thought Konzen dryly.) Goku had, in his annoyingly childish way, forced an opening into Konzen's heart where he had made himself a comfortable little niche. Even if he'd wanted to, Konzen knew he could never hope to force the boy out and refill in that place with cold emptiness. How could he, after experiencing exactly the opposite?\n\nAt last, he muttered, \"Idiot.\"\n\n\"Am I really?\"\n\nThere was a touch of worry and fear in Goku's voice. Konzen frowned, though not quite in anger. \"Yeah.\" After a tense pause, he added in a barely audible tone, \"But I suppose that's all right.\"\n\nGoku smiled, and then shivered. \"I miss Ten-chan... and Ken-nii...\" Konzen couldn't respond. How in the hell was he supposed to react to that? Goku saved him from having to by going on. \"It wouldn't be as bad if I could keep you, too.\"\n\nKonzen closed his eyes, inwardly cursing all the self-righteous bastards that dared reign in heaven. If karma ever came back to bite them in the ass, he would be sure to quietly rub it in their faces with a simple smirk. Laugh? Konzen doubted he knew how, aside from the occasional, almost insane chuckle.\n\nGoku sounded unnerved. \"Konzen? Are you okay?\"\n\nThe blonde deity found himself smiling bitterly again. He quieted his already soft laughter. \"No.\"\n\nGoku's small hands grabbed fistfuls of his shirt. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I'm scared...\"\n\nKonzen sighed, shifting as the stone began to hurt him again. \"Well, I'd say you have every right to be.\"\n\n\"I'm not scared of 'em.\"\n\nThe deity frowned, not sure he had heard right. Goku was squirming, trying to move closer, and Konzen simply couldn't bring himself to discourage the act. \"What?\" Had the boy just contradicted himself?\n\nGolden eyes locked with violet. \"I'm not scared of them,\" Goku repeated, looking uncharacteristically serious and determined. \"Just of losing you.\"\n\nAnd I say you should read this. It only has two reviews."
