        "text": "It’s time to bust out some unpopular, and possibly questionable, opinions! Thanks to Eggsandwich04 for tagging me, this should be a lot of fun!\n\nLets get started.\n\nPopular Series I don’t like:\n\nFor some reason this question gave me the most trouble, probably because I tend to drop series I don’t enjoy pretty quickly and I feel weird saying I don’t like something if I haven’t actually watched very much of it. In the end, I managed to come up with a couple of series that I initially liked, but grew to dislike over time.\n\nSaiyuki\n\nI remember loving this anime as a teen. It was so angsty and dramatic and I loved the character dynamics so much! I didn’t care for the sequel, Saiyuki Reload, which wasted a ton of time re-establishing facts we had learned in the first series and was really boring, but I thought the original series was great. Then, years later, I decided to rewatch Saiyuki and was shocked at how cheap and static the animation was and by what jerks the main characters were. I found that their tragic backstories were no longer as affecting and the plot wasn’t very engaging to me anymore. I found some episodes just painfully stupid and gave up my rewatch partway through and promptly donated my DVDs.\n\nPeach Girl (manga)\n\nPeach Girl was hugely popular back when I was first getting into manga and I decided to pick it up, since it seemed like everyone was reading it. I actually really liked the first couple volumes, they were pretty melodramatic, but in an entertaining way. As the manga progressed, however, the melodrama grew more and more intense and more and more insane, and no longer in a fun way. The main character’s nemesis went from being catty to a straight up criminal and the love triangle became really frustrating. I found myself enjoying each volume less and less, but kept reading because it always seemed to end on a killer cliff-hanger and I would just have to buy the next volume so I could find out what happened next. When I finally reached the conclusion, I dropped the series like a hot potato and never bothered with Peach Girl: Change of Heart or any of the spin-off series.\n\nPopular movie I like, but everyone seems to hate:\n\nKiki’s Delivery Service\n\nI don’t know if people hate this movie exactly, but I know a lot of people who don’t like it and I think that’s a real shame. I do see where they’re coming from, when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I thought it was kind of boring and, for a long time, I counted it as one of my least favourite Studio Ghibli movies. Then I re-watched it as an adult and my opinion of it completely changed. Having gone through the process of starting a career and moving away from home and having experienced things like burn-out and creative stagnation, I can now relate to the story in a way I never could before and I find it to be a very moving and beautiful film. I wouldn’t say it’s my favourite Studio Ghibli movie, but I do think it’s under appreciated.\n\nLove triangle where the character didn’t end up with the character I wanted:\n\nMe & My Brothers\n\nThe love triangle in this cutesy series is between the main character, her nice and age-appropriate friend, and her super not age-appropriate step-brother. Guess who she ends up falling for: Her step-brother! Even if these characters aren’t related by blood, they considered themselves to be siblings, so it’s still incest and this development transformed an adorable series into a super uncomfortable one.\n\nPopular genre you hardly watch:\n\nHorror.\n\nI’m a bit of a wimp, so horror really isn’t my thing. I’ll occasionally read manga with horror elements, but I almost never read straight-up horror series and I avoid watching horror movies.\n\nPopular character you don’t like:\n\nI kind of don’t like Goku from Dragon Ball. I don’t hate him, but I don’t find him interesting. My favourite parts of the series are the portions were he’s absent and the focus is on the other characters. That’s usually when the narrative tension is highest and the series is the most exciting, as you always know Goku’s going to win as soon as he shows up.\n\nPopular show or series I can’t get into:\n\nThe Rising of the Hero Shield\n\nI watched the first, double-length episode of this show and knew immediately that it wasn’t for me. The inclusion of a false rape accusation plotline pissed me off and when the main character decided that he was okay with participating in slavery, I was done. I’ve heard that the show gets better, but I’m not interested in slogging through any more episodes to see if that’s true.\n\nPopular show or movie I have no interest in:\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nI haven’t watched a full episode of this show or read any of the books, but I have picked up a lot of information about it over the years from friends, the internet and from briefly glimpsing a few scenes when my mom was watching it, and I’m not really interested in giving it a try. I have a pretty high tolerance for dark and violent content in the media that I consume, but, from what I can tell, this series goes past dark and violent and into grim and brutal territory, and that’s just not for me.\n\nOddly enough, this is a show that has been recommended to me multiple times as something people think that I would like, and I just can’t fathom why. I realize that this is a good quality show, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with enjoying it or being a fan of it, but I don’t get why people think that it would appeal to me specifically. One of my co-workers said she thought I’d like it because I like Lord of the Rings, but I was under the impression that Game of Thrones is something of an intentional rejection of your typical high-fantasy style narrative. I just don’t get it…\n\nPopular Show or Movie that I prefer over the book:\n\nAngels & Demons\n\nI really enjoyed reading The Da Vinci Code back in the day, but none of Dan Brown’s other novels, that I’ve read, have been as entertaining and I found Angels & Demons to be a much weaker book in comparison to it’s more famous sequel. The movie is pretty good though and I actually like it better then The Da Vinci Code movie. Plus, the movie, thankfully, left out a lot of the racist parts that were in the book!\n\nPopular Show or movie that I prefer over the manga:\n\nMy Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom\n\nBoth that anime and the manga are based on the original light novels, which I haven’t read, but it seems to me that the anime is the superior adaptation. I do enjoy the manga, but the anime includes a lot more details, some of which are important to understanding the characters, so I’d recommend the anime over the manga any day.\n\nSo those are some of my unpopular opinions! Be sure to let me know your thoughts on these in the comments section and also be sure to check out some of Eggsandwich04’s posts at KS Blogs, especially if you’re a manga fan!\n\nI’d like to tag the following people to post their own unpopular opinions:\n\nmangaotakuu\n\npokeninja90\n\nRory\n\nRose\n\n7mononoke\n\nThanks for reading!"
