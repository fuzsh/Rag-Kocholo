        "text": "About the Saiyuki Original Series Resurrected Hardcover Manga Volume 3\n\nThe boys are back, in 400-page hardcovers that are as pretty and badass as they are! This hit adventure -- which blends mythology from around the world into a classic adventure story -- has been out of print for years, and this collector's edition is a fitting celebration of its return! Genjyo Sanzo is a Buddhist priest in the city of Shangri-La, which is being ravaged by yokai spirits that have fallen out of balance with the natural order. His superiors send him on a journey far to the west to discover why this is happening and how to stop it. His companions are three yokai with human souls. But this is no day trip -- the four will encounter many discoveries and horrors on the way, and on the road, Sanzo will wonder... can he really trust his supernatural companions? This is the original 'bishonen' (pretty boys) action manga, and though it's not yaoi its fandom helped launch the yaoi craze. Old fans will be thrilled it's returning, and new fans will finally have a chance to experience the series. A loose adaptation of the Chinese classic Journey to the West (like the Dragon Ball saga) Hardcover 2-in-1 volumes will include new translation and lettering as well as exclusive bonus content. The edition will come to five volumes total. Ages 16 and up. 'An edgy comic look at an ancient Chinese tale.' -YALSA 'Possibly the most gonzo version of the circa 1600 Chinese classic Journey to the West I have yet encountered, the pilgrim monk and his supernatural helpers are here re-envisioned as a sort of bishonen boy band on the Worst. Roadtrip. Ever. ... the dragon prince that turns into a white horse [in the original] here turns into a jeep.'"
