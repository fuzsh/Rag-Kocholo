        "text": "The boys are back, in 400-page hardcovers that are as pretty and badass as they are! This hit adventure — which blends mythology from around the world into a classic adventure story — has been out of print for years, and this collector’s edition is a fitting celebration of its return!\n\nGenjyo Sanzo is a Buddhist priest in the city of Shangri-La, which is being ravaged by yokai spirits that have fallen out of balance with the natural order. His superiors send him on a journey far to the west to discover why this is happening and how to stop it. His companions are three yokai with human souls. But this is no day trip — the four will encounter many discoveries and horrors on the way, and on the road, Sanzo will wonder… can he really trust his supernatural companions?"
