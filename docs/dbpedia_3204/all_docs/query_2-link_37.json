        "text": "So we’ve all heard the news by now, and emotions are running high. Of course we’re all desperately excited. To be getting a new anime of Saiyuki means Saiyuki will be returning to the mainstream. It means new exposure & new content. All things this fandom craves and needs.\n\nHowever, there is also trepidation. Why is it that Blast has been selected to be animated? Out of the three main Saiyuki stories (Saiyuki, Saiyuki Reload and Saiyuki Reload Blast), it is the only one not completed. And we have seen what happens when unfinished Saiyuki stories get turned into anime. Sometimes it’s an anime-only story that rivals the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist in excellent quality and character development: like Saiyuki Gensomaden and the Homura arc.\n\nAnd sometimes it’s Saiyuki Reload Gunlock. And also, quite frankly, most of the fillers of Reload. Never. Forget.\n\nHowever, since that is not this day, what do I hope to come out of a Saiyuki Reload Blast anime? I would like to see as many flashbacks into Reload as possible. I want to see the Oasis arc, and the battle between youkai Hakkai and Seiten Taisei. Again, in an ideal world, we would be getting all of this in a reboot somewhere down the line, but it would be fantastic to see now.\n\nI would love for this to lead to the translation of all the Saiyuki volumes into English. If this anime could return excitement to the fandom, that would be beyond incredible. Translate Saiyuki Gaiden! Saiyuki Ibun! Translate Saiyuki Reload Blast!! And all of the novels and doujins as well!! I am talking about Crossroads, Offroad, the works. This, in itself, would hopefully lead to a reboot.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point: the dubbing of all as yet undubbed Saiyuki OVAs with the original ADV Films cast. And, potentially, the re-dubbing of the Saiyuki Reload and Saiyuki Reload Gunlock serieses. I am talking about Saiyuki Premium, Saiyuki Reload Burial, Saiyuki: The Jade Pearl, and that 4th Saiyuki Gaiden instalment. Just pile them all onto one fat deluxe DVD, dubb the lot, and let us throw money at you, please.\n\nA Saiyuki Reload Blast anime was not what I was hoping for. I was hoping for a complete reboot that would cover every single story, doujin, manga, CD Drama, musical, and good anime filer that Kazuya Minekura has ever made. And, by the time that this reboot got to Bast, and if the manga still wasn’t finished, it could spin off into its own ending, and we could worry about a specifically manga-true Saiyuki Reload Blast anime later.\n\nHowever, I recognise that such a reboot is an incredibly large project, a labor of love. And, quite frankly, the series and fandom is simply not huge enough at this point to support it. However, maybe, just maybe, with the release of this Saiyuki Reload Blast anime, the ball can start rolling again."
