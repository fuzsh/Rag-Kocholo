This hit adventure-which blends mythology from around the world into a classic adventure story-has been out of print for years, and this collector’s edition is a fitting celebration of its return!\n\nGenjo is a Buddhist priest in the city of Shangri-La, which is being ravaged by yokai spirits that have fallen out of balance with the natural order. His superiors send him on a journey far to the west to discover why this is happening and how to stop it. His companions are three yokai with human souls. But this is no day trip-the four will encounter many discoveries and horrors on the way, and on the road, Genjo will wonder… can he really trust his supernatural companions?"
