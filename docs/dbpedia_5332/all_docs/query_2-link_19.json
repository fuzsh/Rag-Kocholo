        "text": "Have you ever wondered how the historic Lincoln Motor Company came to be? What was the story behind one of the most iconic American brands?\n\nThe Lincoln Motor Company was first established by Henry Leland in 1917. From its humble beginnings as a car manufacturer, it has grown into one of America’s oldest and most trusted car brands. It has survived recessions and changed ownership a couple of times over its long history.\n\nToday we celebrate the evolution of original American fashion powerhouse, The Lincoln Motor Company. With an extensive and intricate history, journey with us as we unravel the stories that brought this iconic brand to life.\n\nFrom the time Henry Leland founded the Lincoln Motor Company, it has become an iconic American car brand. As Lincoln celebrates its 100th anniversary, we can look back and appreciate the evolution of a brand that carried us through more than a century of histories and milestones.\n\nHenry Leland, who also co-founded Cadillac, started Lincoln in 1917in Detroit Michigan with the intention of producing engines and aircraft parts during World War I. Business was slow at first but picked up shortly after when they began to produced luxury cars. In 1922 Leland sold his stake in the company to Ford and it evolved into the brand’s first real production phase. During this time models such as the Model K and L were released providing an elegant solution for automobile travel.\n\nLincoln underwent significant development from 1945 onward with Franklin D Roosevelt Jr leading several changes to bring out a memorable range of cars unmatched by any other car maker – including power windows, automatic headlight dimmers, electric wipers and air conditioning systems – all considered luxuries at the time. Among these model’s included some of today’s most iconic American cars – The Continental Convertible, Town Car and Mark VIII Coupe/Sedan known for their impressive design quality that still extends to modern day vehicles.\n\nThe nineties saw vast changes for Lincoln as Ford aimed to create even greater luxury vehicles with undeniable individuality which resulted in some popularly remembered models like Navigator, LS sedan and Aviator SUV’s being unveiled alongside the Blackwood: an experimental pickup truck created from another classic – The Continental sedan.\n\nStepping into 2023 presents a whole new era for Lincoln as they use cutting-edge technology with advanced suspension systems amongst other features available on their product portfolio including the new 2023 Lincoln Aviator and new 2023 Lincoln Corsair. Lincoln steps into the future with electric vehicles, new technology and the Lincoln dealer effortless experience. One thing will remain ever true – maintaining their timeless emphasis on strength in craftsmanship backed by innovation across Lincoln Motor Company; making them uniquely capable machines precisely tailored towards individual needs.\n\nDave Sinclair Lincoln St. Peters just completed our brand new Lincoln facility making it one of the most cutting edge luxury automotive facilities in the Midwest.
