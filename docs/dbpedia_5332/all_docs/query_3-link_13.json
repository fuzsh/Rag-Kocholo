        "text": "Explore the Electric Jaguar Range\n\nJaguar is leading the charge on electric motoring – the Jaguar I-PACE, our first all-electric performance SUV being crowned World Car of the year 2019.\n\nFor fleet and business, electric cars provide numerous benefits on-the-road and on the balance sheet – reducing your emissions to zero and your ownership costs too.\n\nShowcase your company’s commitment to a cleaner planet whilst saving on servicing and fuel but that’s not all. The Jaguar I-PACE is exempt from benefit-in-kind (BIK) taxation for the financial year 2020/21, Vehicle Excise Duty and any emissions-based charges but also qualifies for 100% write down allowance.\n\nPlease talk to our fleet team to discover how Jaguar electric cars might benefit your business and put your organisation on the road to a more sustainable future.\n\nElectric for Fleet & Business\n\nIt’s easy to see why more and more businesses are plugging into the world of Jaguar electric power.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that the choice of all-electric and hybrid cars available from our showroom deliver the hallmarks of exhilarating performance, intelligent technology and progressive design that Jaguar drivers know and love.\n\nBut now more than ever, this outstanding range exceeds the efficiency demands of the modern motorist thanks to an enticing offering of zero tailpipe emissions, reduced running costs and significant financial incentives.\n\nThe electric revolution has arrived. Be part of it at Sinclair Jaguar.\n\nSPEAK TO OUR BUSINESS SPECIALISTVIEW OUR BUSINESS OFFER\n\nElectric motoring – the benefits\n\nChoose Jaguar and there are benefits for both the company car driver and his or her employer.\n\nLower Benefit in Kind (BIK) Tax\n\nIn April 2020, the UK government introduced a scale to calculate company car tax based on the number of emission-free miles they can cover.\n\nUnder the government’s emissions-based mandate, all-electric car or PHEV owners will only pay 2% or 11% respectively in monthly BIK tax charges for the financial year 2022/23.\n\nZero emissions\n\nJaguar’s all-electric cars are free from tailpipe emissions thus reducing your organisation’s impact on the environment whilst demonstrating a commitment to sustainability.,/\n\nReduced servicing costs\n\nWith fewer moving parts than a combustion engine and regenerative braking capabilities gentler on brakes and tyres, there is the potential for lower servicing costs.\n\nFuel savings\n\nThe daily cost of running an all-electric or plug-in hybrid car compared to a petrol or diesel alternative is cheaper as fuel is more expensive per mile than the cost of electricity. Home charging on an overnight off-peak electricity tariff offers further opportunity to save.\n\nZero road tax\n\nJaguar's all-electric cars are exempt from the regular £140 road tax and any emissions-based charges, including the London Congestion Charge, whilst plug-in hybrid options attract tax savings and incentives too.\n\nLower National Insurance\n\nThe lower BIK rate of electric cars means employers will pay lower National Insurance Contributions (NICs) than on equivalent petrol or diesel vehicles.\n\n100% Write Down Allowance\n\nAs a vehicle with zero tailpipe emissions, our all-electric cars qualify for 100% write down allowance - enabling companies to deduct its full value from annual profits before tax.\n\nWorkplace Charging incentive\n\nUnder the Government’s Workplace Charging Scheme (WCS), organisations can save up to 75% on the purchase and installation cost of a charging point at their premises (capped at £500 per point) and are able to claim for a maximum of 20 single or 10 double socket charge points.\n\nReady to switch to electric?\n\nIf you’re interested in making the move to a Jaguar electric car or fleet then we have a dedicated team who are ready to help.\n\nSo if you have any questions about the range, want to arrange a test drive or would like to know more about the financial benefits and incentives available to you as an organisation or a company car driver then please get in touch.\n\nContact Us"
