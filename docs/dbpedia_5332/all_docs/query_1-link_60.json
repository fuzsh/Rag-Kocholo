        "text": "The First Chechen War is yet another example of a major power possessing all conventional military advantages losing to a much smaller side. Morale, planning, overconfidence and extreme difficulty of overcoming guerilla warfare against a determined side are all factors to consider. Just manpower and firepower advantage is not always enough. You also need a powerful story and unwavering commitment to reach your goal. Chechens had both in bunches in this war. Watch this video on the First Chechen War, the script for which was written by me. https://lnkd.in/e_x9_p7R\n\nWhat's it like to take a senior seminar? History major Ryan Karcher (BA 2023) had always been interested in military history, so the seminar on 'World War I and the Middle East' that Dr. Nilay Özok-Gündoğan offered in the spring was perfect for him. As Ryan put it: \"Be passionate about the work you do – and you will do well. If you find something you love, it will not seem like work to you.\" Click on fla.st/HFZOFB7D to read the interview with Ryan on the department's website #seniorseminar #fsuhistory #undergraduateresearch #historymajor\n\nAs we say at Ford, be curious! D-Day - Salute to all of the armed services. We often forget the back stories as we celebrate the great day that freed Europe. The African American soldiers were there on the beaches of Omaha and Normandy. They were in support roles, though vital weren't allowed in combat units because of unjust laws that prohibited them from doing so. During WWII, more than 2.5 million African American men registered for the draft, and African American women volunteered in large numbers. America's entry into WWII was in 1941. However, it wasn't until 1944 that the 92nd Infantry Division known as the Buffalo Soldiers, who were the first African American Soldiers sent into combat. This division landed in Italy and made its way through the country until they encountered German troops in September. The Buffalo Soldiers are recognized for their push of the Germans far into Northern Italy.

So much so that the war began to be seen as a war between ideologies, yet it was the civilians and military personel that had to pay the price. Michael G. Stroud discusses the “struggle between the virtues of Democracy and the evils of Communism\" that was embodied by the Korean War, in his latest article on our website!

I’m planning to put something together. Happy to write a cohesive narrative for a panel or round table and chair it. If anyone wants to put together an abstract about about US support to Ukraine, oral history, digital/digitizing history, preserving recent history, housing the military, and/or unconventional approaches to history, let me know. Have another idea? Pitch it! I’m great at connecting what might seem disparate ideas, and my own research is so all-encompassing that I can flex. Deadline is soon! Hit me up by 7 Sept. #societyformilitaryhistory #smh #paper #proposals #history #militaryhistory #professionaldevelopment #conference #panel #roundtable #presentation #oralhistory #research #digitalhistory #digitalhumanities #ukrainewar #militaryhousing #recenthistory\n\nVeterans Love You Thank You I appreciate and acknowledge of the sacrifices made by veterans and their families. While I don't have personal experiences, I can certainly share some common types of stories and experiences that military members might encounter during their service: Deployments: Many service members spend extended periods away from home, often in challenging and dangerous environments. The separation from loved ones can be emotionally difficult for both the deployed individual and their family. Combat Experiences: Those in combat roles may have intense and life-changing experiences on the front lines. These experiences can have a lasting impact on their mental and emotional well-being. Humanitarian Missions: Military personnel are often involved in humanitarian efforts, providing aid and support in response to natural disasters or other crises. These missions showcase the positive impact the military can have on communities in need. Training and Camaraderie: Military training builds discipline, teamwork, and resilience. Many veterans cherish the bonds formed with their fellow service members and the sense of purpose that comes with serving their country. Adaptability and Skills Development: Military service often requires individuals to adapt to new environments and learn a variety of skills. These skills can range from technical expertise to leadership and problem-solving, contributing to personal growth and development. Understanding these experiences can indeed foster a deeper appreciation for the sacrifices made by veterans and their families. It's important to recognize the multifaceted nature of military service and the diverse roles that individuals play within the armed forces. Learning about history and the experiences of those who have served can indeed broaden our perspectives and contribute to a more informed and empathetic society. If your a vet please share your story...#assetly"
