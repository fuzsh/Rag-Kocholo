        "text": "Wyoming lawmakers were considering bucking a national trend of embracing electric vehicles (EVs) by proposing a ban on EV sales by the year 2035, but that proposal has quickly died.\n\nThe resolution, sponsored bySen. Jim Anderson, R-Casper, was apparently a response to other states, like California, banning the sale of gas-powered vehicles by the same year. The resolution, introduced on Friday, sought the banning of EV sales in Wyoming by 2035.\n\nOil and gas production has long been one of Wyoming's proud and valued industries,\" the resolution said. \"The oil and gas industry in Wyoming has created countless jobs and has contributed revenues to the state of Wyoming throughout the state's history.\"\n\nThe resolution called electric vehicles \"impracticable\" in Wyoming, where a \"lack of electric vehicle charging infrastructure\" and \"vast stretches of highway\" combine to create a supposedly unfavorable environment for EVs.\n\nIn addition, the resolution claimed the batteries used in EVs \"contain critical minerals whose domestic supply is limited and at risk for disruption\" and \"are not easily recyclable or disposable.\"\n\nThe resolution was brought before Wyoming's on Monday, where it faced some debate, but didn't get far.\n\n, Sen. Anderson admitted the proposal was, essentially, a statement against states looking to ban gas-powered vehicles.\n\nWe didn’t want to make a bill that would say that the dealerships have to really quit selling vehicles,” Anderson said. “We just wanted to make a statement that there is a counter to stopping selling gas vehicles in other states.\"\n\nAnderson added that the resolution was meant to support his state's oil and gas industries, which are \"huge for Wyoming,\" according to the lawmaker.\n\nThe resolution later died during the committee meeting for lack of a motion, but Anderson reportedly said that he had accomplished his goal of starting a conversation on the topic.\n\nIt’s all over the nation now. Two major news outlets have asked me to interview...,” Anderson said, according to . “So yes, we’ve got done what we needed to get done in informing the nation we’re supporting our industries.\n\nSeveral major car companies have already said they by or before 2035. States like California and Oregon have made investments in charging infrastructure to accommodate the predicted influx of EVs.\n\nAAA’s Director of Automotive EngineeringGreg Brannon has already said that in EV battery technology before people all across the United States will be able to comfortably own and travel in electric vehicles, according to previous reporting by The National Desk.\n\nIt's predicted that by 2040, 20% of vehicles on U.S. roads will be electric."
