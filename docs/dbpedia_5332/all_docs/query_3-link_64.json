Our work with the IBEW also allows us to offer lower service rates to our residential customers and helped create many new aspects of the business.\n\nA brief timeline of the company:\n\n1957: “Joe” Dickey Electric opens for business.\n\n1960: Company establishes its first 1,200-square-foot showroom on Woodworth-Springfield Road.\n\n1962: Dickey adds 4,800 square feet of space to its showroom.\n\n1969: Dickey moves from its Woodworth-Springfield showroom to the three-acre site of the former North Lima Lumber at 180 W. South Range Road.\n\n1980: Built additional 3,000-square-foot building on the site and increases staff to 30 electricians, two superintendents and additional office staff.\n\n1993: Joe Dickey’s son, David, takes over as president and chief operating officer. Joe remains CEO.\n\nToday, the company employs up to 250 electricians, has an office staff of 20 professionals and maintains a fleet of more than 50 specialized vehicles. It recently completed a full renovation of its office and warehouse in North Lima, Ohio."
