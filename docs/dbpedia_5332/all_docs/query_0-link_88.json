        "text": "Brandon Burgess is a bit of a throwback.\n\n“We’re one of the last full, service gas stations around,” he said in between pumps at his vintage station on Highway 171 in Moses Lake. “We’re family owned, family operated. My wife works here. I got my son that works in during the summer. That’s kind of what they know.”\n\nHis business called Affordable Auto Services, has actually been around since the 1940s as the old \"McBrides\" service station in this small Central Washington town.\n\nBurgess is now part of an old guard, while simultaneously having a front porch to the new frontier.\n\nYou see, Moses Lake may be key to unlocking a plan now set in motion by Washington state's governor.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee has now set a goal of phasing out gasoline powered car sales by 2035. It seems like a daunting plan on the surface considering electric vehicle sales and infrastructure are lagging. Inslee said in a January interview with KOMO News, “The problem of electric cars is not that people won’t buy them, we can’t produce enough of them right now.”\n\nWashington state licensing data shows there are nearly 63,000 registered electric vehicles in King County, but only three other counties have more than 7,000, and most counties only have a few hundred or tens of EV’s. U.S. Department of Energy Maps also show a lack of charging stations east of the mountains, compared to an ample amount on the west side. That is perhaps why a recent Crosscut Poll suggested a majority of Washingtonians don’t want any sort of electrified mandate.\n\n“Everybody wants more range. Everybody wants to lower cost. People especially want faster charging. Charge anxiety is one of the biggest constraints to electric vehicle adoption,” said Rick Luebbe, CEO of Woodinville-based Group14 Technologies, and when asked point blank about meeting Inslee’s goal, he said, “It is not going to be easy. But I think it is possible.”\n\nLuebbe’s company was specifically cited by Inslee as one of the causes for optimism. Group14 was recently awarded a $100 million federal grant to plant some seeds, in that field not too far away from Burgess’ long standing gas station.\n\nIt plans on building a commercial scale factory to produce powder for silicon batteries, which he said can power 200,000 EV’s a year, and faster than current models. “It enables a completely different level of performance in the battery. 50% more energy density, which mean 50% more range. You know if you can charge your car in 5 to 10 minutes, maybe you don’t even need that much range, so you get a smaller battery pack.”\n\nLuebbe added, “Think about the smartphone. Can you imagine not owning a smartphone? The first iPhone just came out 15 years ago. I think that's the kind of transformation and that kind of acceleration of adoption, that we can see with EVs, as we improve the performance, as we alleviate charge anxiety.\"\n\nBack on Highway 171, Brandon may be at the literal crossroads, with a view of the future and a connection to the past. He also said he wonders if the electrical grid can be built out enough to handle such a change in mindset.\n\n“It'll affect a lot of people,” he said, or “If 2035 rolls around, they say, no more gas, you know, it's going to be hard.”\n\nA driver pulls in, looking to schedule a tune up. Brandon continues.\n\n“We’ve got to adapt into figuring out a way to service both,” he admitted, “I think there is a lot of options out there for us. But to say 2035, no more gas vehicles or no more gas vehicles to be sold. We've got a long way to go.”"
