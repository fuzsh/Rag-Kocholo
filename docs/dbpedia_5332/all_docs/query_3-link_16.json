        "text": "At Versant Power, we're continuing our commitment to environmental stewardship and technological advancement through support of electric vehicle technology. Electric vehicles have many benefits to both the user and our environment.\n\nVersant Power has expanded certain rates and created new rates to offer savings for customers using electric vehicles, energy storage, heat pumps and heat pump water heaters.\n\nAs a result of An Act to Advance Energy Storage in Maine, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved agreements on Sept. 27, 2022 to implement rates to encourage efficient adoption of electric vehicles, energy storage, heat pumps and heat pump water heaters.\n\nThe new and/or expanded rates will encourage electricity use during periods of lower demand and aim to help customers save money.\n\nWe have announced the following rates as of November 2022:\n\nHome Eco Rate – (Bangor Hydro District)\n\nThis is available for electric vehicle charging and/or battery storage (battery storage devices enable energy from renewables, like solar and wind, to be stored and then released when customers need power most). This is a time of use rate.\n\nThis is the same as our residential service rate time-of-use, but adds electric vehicle charging and electric battery storage.\n\nThis will be available in the Maine Public District after the meter replacement project is complete.\n\nBusiness Eco Rate – (Maine Public District and Bangor Hydro District)\n\nThis rate is for commercial Level 2 electric vehicle charging and battery storage. (Level 2 chargers are plugged into a 240V outlet which allows charging 3 to 7 times faster depending on the electric car and the charger. They usually have to be installed by an electrician.)\n\nThis is the same as the Maine Public District’s General Service.\n\nThis is the same as the Bangor Hydro District General Service w/ 25kW cap.\n\nAdditional rates were announced as of June 2023:\n\nHome Eco Rate with Bonus Meter – (Bangor Hydro District)\n\nThis rate is the same as residential electric thermal storage, but adds separately metered EV charging and/or storage\n\nPayment is required for second meter installation, but there are no separate minimum monthly charges for a second meter\n\nBusiness Eco Rate – (Bangor Hydro District)\n\nThis rate is for commercial Level 2 EV charging and battery storage\n\nPayment is required for second meter installation, but there are no separate minimum monthly charges for a second meter\n\nThis is the same as the Business Eco Rate above, but with a 50kW cap.\n\nDC Fast Charging and Storage Eco Rate – (Bangor Hydro District)\n\nThis rate is for Level 3+ (fast) EV charging and battery storage\n\nPayment is required for second meter installation, but there are no separate minimum monthly charges for a second meter\n\nVersant Power has also been undertaking an advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) project and additional rates will be available upon its completion.\n\nTo inquire about these rates, please contact Customer Service toll free at 1-855-363-7211 or local at 207-973-2000.\n\nElectric Vehicles at Versant\n\nThe quiet, smooth operation, surprisingly quick acceleration, and increased digital connectivity make the driving experience incredibly enjoyable.\n\nElectric vehicles have lower emissions than internal combustion engines running on gas or diesel, which can greatly reduce their environmental impact. Also, as almost all U.S. electricity is produced domestically, electric vehicles help alleviate our reliance on foreign petroleum by making us less vulnerable to price spikes and supply disruptions.\n\nOur newest electric vehicle is a Chevy Bolt. On a full charge, this All-Battery Electric Vehicles has a 238-mile range. This impressive range means we can get to meetings throughout our service territory on a single charge.\n\nVersant Power has helped sponsor EV charging stations within the communities we serve and helped fund the purchase of an EV to Northern Maine Community College’s Automotive Technology Program.\n\nFor more information about electric vehicles, such as rebates and charging infrastructure, visit www.efficiencymaine.com/ev/.\n\nPlease Identify Your Service Area\n\nClick on your district on the map, or select a zip code or town from the lists.\n\nSelect Your District on the Map Below\n\nor\n\nBy Zip Code\n\nor\n\nBy Town\n\nVersant Power provides electric delivery service to two areas – the Bangor Hydro District and the Maine Public District.\n\nThe Bangor Hydro District includes Hancock, Piscataquis and Washington Counties and most of Penobscot County.\n\nThe Maine Public District serves Aroostook County and a small piece of Penobscot County.\n\nBecause some information varies by District, please identify your District on the map above, or enter your town or zipcode. If you need information on both Districts, switch back and forth at any time by selecting the district selector button.\n\nIf the browser you are using has cookies enabled, you will only have to make this selection once.( If your browser has cookies disabled your selection will be remembered until you close the browser, but not when you return to the site.)"
