        "text": "Today, I'm happy. It's been an emotional start to 2024 for SWYTCHD and I. My last post was fairly recent when I announced that the company was starting its journey to raise another round of capital. Whatâ€™s hidden in the background is that actually, 1: SWYTCHD turned EBITDA positive in September 2: SWYTCHD is now PROFITABLE. I mean makes a PBT! Less than 12 months after we raised the first round of capital. A flood of thoughts and memories come to mind now. First when I left a fantastic career, a great company, brilliant colleagues, and inspiring mentors to start SWYTCHD. Leaving a job, that basically paid what SWYTCHD used to make earlier this year is never easy. Making no monthly income seemed not natural. I drew no pay for over a year. Jaguar Land Rover taught me everything I know. I worked in so many functions with so many people that starting a business didnâ€™t seem daunting. I did everything. I mean everything. For 6 months, I had no employees. I washed, cleaned, polished every vehicle. I personally delivered over 137 vehicles to customers. Many times, I sat in trucks with the driverâ€™s to transport vehicles. I rescued customers at night when they were stranded. I did all of the marketing, made SWYTCHDâ€™s first website, operating processes, literature, EVERYTHINGâ€¦.I have spoken to over 1000 customers and even now my phone number is SWYTCHDâ€™s customer support line. All of which I still love to do. I learnt Kannada, improved my Hindi, made Bengaluru home again. Convinced people to invest in SWYTCHD, raised asset financing. Took hit after hit of rejections and went on SHARK TANK INDIA ðŸ˜Šâ€¦ I remember, my disappointment after my TV pitch which now was almost 17 months ago. One of the Sharks (BTW all were very nice to me) said they didnâ€™t feel like I had depthâ€¦ That personally really stung me. I started working at 18, made it to Senior Management at a $30bn company at 26. The thoughts that swirl in oneâ€™s mind range from not being adequate, maybe good manager not good enough to lead a business... It was all folly really! One personâ€™s opinion shouldnâ€™t matter and affect your mindset. I had managed $1.2bn budgets, hired and managed teams in 2 continents, saved the business $1.4m a year from special projects. I have DEPTH. That depth of experience has meant a company, < 2 years after it started, pays for peopleâ€™s livelihood, has reduced 100s of tons of CO2 from being pumped into the atmosphere, whose customers have collectively driven more than 3million KM and given so many people, their first opportunity to drive an EV. I put my head down, said no to awards, ceremonies, paid articles, events etc. Focus only on what it takes to build a business, make customers happy, keep the team strong and relentless focus on P&L. So today, Iâ€™m okay to celebrate 2 years of very hard work. A big thank you to Mukund Singh, Shravana Reddy, Tousif, Suresh, Abid , Purabhi P, Sanath, Rakshith, Kumarpal, Kiran and Kiran ðŸ˜Š and Bhavan."
