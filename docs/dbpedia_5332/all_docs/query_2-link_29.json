        "text": "Collected commentary. There were certainly as many words written about the automobile as there were new cars on the road every year. We sample a small portion here, in three broad topics: first, the auto's direct effects such as traffic congestion, pedestrian deaths, and reduced travel time; second, its psychological effects as status symbol, guarantor of personal independence, token of one's individual worth, and herald of progress in the MACHINE AGE; and finally, one of the pivotal events of the decade, Ford's introduction of the modern Model A in 1927. Compare the commentary with that on other marvels of the decade, the airplane, the radio, and movies. You will find that humor appears more often in the automobile commentary: why? Selections can be divided among students for research and classroom discussion. (13 pp.)\n\nHumorist Will Rogers on traffic safety. Renowned as the \"cowboy-philosopher\" of the 1920s and 1930s, Rogers began a nationally syndicated column of witty yet pungent news commentary in 1922. Becoming popular across the partisan divide, he traveled nationwide delivering his humorous take on the day's events. His folksy humor always delivered a punch, as is evident in his syndicated column of April 4, 1926, in which he challenged Americans' seeming acceptance of mounting traffic fatalities, and in his brief address to traffic chiefs, recorded in June 1923, in which he offered five \"rules\" for reducing traffic accidents (see transcript). What harsh realities could Rogers address through humor? what political messages? To see and hear him in action, view the one-minute newsreel of his 1928 appearance with Speaker of the House John Nance Garner in Washington, DC.\n\nWheels of Progress, ca. 1927. Produced by the U.S. Bureau of Roads, this silent film contrasts the early days of auto travel in the 1890s with the rapid changes of the 1920s. \"What has wrought this change? Motors—Good roads—Personal transportation.\" Placing its promotional message for roads within the educational film, the Bureau reminded the driving and taxpaying public that \"like the hen and the egg—the motor car and the road are indispensable to one another's progress.\" Print the intertitles text (black-panel text) to aid your viewing of the film. (14:13) INTERNET MOVING IMAGE ARCHIVE\n\nSilent newsreels. Produced in the Motor City by the Detroit News, these newsreels present light-hearted vignettes on the pursuit of safer brakes. In \"Motorists try brakes for police department\" (1927), drivers receive a sticker if their cars successfully brake within a specified distance. In \"Had your automobile brakes tested yet?\" (1928), we are introduced to the \"decelerometer,\" a device for measuring how quickly an auto can brake to a stop. How did these newsreels function as entertainment as well as safety messages?"
