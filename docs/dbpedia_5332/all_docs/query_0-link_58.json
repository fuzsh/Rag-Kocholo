        "text": "ALL ELECTRIC. ALL JAGUAR.\n\nLooking for a motoring experience that is truly electrifying then you've come to the right place.\n\nIntroducing the Jaguar Electric range; the smart and sustainable move to electric now comes without a drop in performance. Featuring F-PACE, E-PACE and our multi award winning I-PACE.\n\nGoing Electric with Jaguar opens up an exciting opportunity to enjoy a more sustainable, smarter driving experience.\n\nThe Jaguar Electrified range takes performance and craftmanship into the next generation. Your next Jaguar will be highly efficient, highly powerful and, as always, highly regarded. Your next Jaguar will be electrified.\n\nJAGUAR ELECTRIC POWER - YOUR CHOICES\n\nSinclair Jaguar offers a range of all-electric and hybrid vehicles to suit your requirements for performance and efficiency and your driving demands.\n\nALL-ELECTRIC BEV\n\nTwo electric motors and a battery are the power source behind Jaguar all-electric performance delivering a virtually silent driving experience. With no requirement for petrol or diesel, there are zero tailpipe emissions produced.\n\nWhilst the pure electric powertrain is incredibly quiet, it is also impressively thrilling - allowing instantly smooth acceleration without gear change disruption. With the battery located between the axles for optimum weight distribution, agility is further enhanced.\n\nCharging is simple and straightforward via the ever-expanding network of public charging points or at home, where a full charge can be achieved without fuss overnight using a home charger or domestic plug socket.\n\nPLUG-IN HYBRID (PHEV)\n\nEnjoy the best of both worlds with a Jaguar Plug-in Hybrid, which enables owners to seamlessly and flexibly switch between an electric motor and a petrol engine.\n\nThere are zero tailpipe emissions if you opt for full Electric Vehicle (EV) mode for a trip into town or daily commute whilst, for longer journeys, you can combine it with Petrol in Hybrid mode. The choice is entirely yours and performance is smooth and powerful either way.\n\nEV mode offers a virtually silent travel experience with the battery charged by regenerative braking and external power sources located at home or a public charging station.\n\nMILD HYBRID (MHEV)\n\nLooking for more efficiency from the stop-start of today's urban driving then look no further than one of the latest Jaguar MHEV model.\n\nThe technology employed on these cars utilises the combination of a Jaguar Ingenium petrol or diesel engine with a powerful underfloor battery to intelligently recover and redeploy energy that would normally be lost when coasting, braking or stationary.\n\nThe MHEV's refined electrified powertrain is ideally suited to driving on congested roads and rewards owners with improved fuel economy and lower tailpipe emissions.\n\nCHARGING\n\nCharging your electric Jaguar is simple and straightforward whether undertaken at home or whilst you're out and about.\n\nHOME CHARGING\n\nThe easiest and fastest way to charge your Jaguar is with a professionally-installed wall box or home charging point.\n\nSimply plug in your vehicle overnight and it will be ready to go in the morning with a full charge onboard. For peace-of-mind, you can also charge albeit at a slower rate via a standard three-pin socket.\n\nCharging at home is not only convenient but it's cheaper than petrol or diesel too when compared per mile and even more so with an off-peak electricity tariff.\n\nFind Out More\n\nPUBLIC CHARGING\n\nIt's now more easier than ever to charge your electric Jaguar on the go.\n\nAC/DC CHARGING – GETTING UP TO SPEED\n\nTo connect to a charging point, your Jaguar uses a Combined Charging System (CCS). This is compatible with slower AC charging speeds, and on selected models, rapid DC charging speeds. Some other car manufacturers use different systems for charging such as CHAdeMO. These are less-widely used across the charging network and are incompatible with Jaguar.\n\nSlower AC charging points are in places such as retail parks, gyms and car parks. Rapid DC charging points are typically located on motorways and main roads.\n\nREQUEST CALL BACK\n\nIN-CAR NAVIGATION\n\nYour Jaguar’s navigation system5 creates door-to-door route planning while highlighting charging points and monitoring live traffic and along the way.\n\n4Compatible smart phones only. Subject to market mobile network, signal and customer account. Requires mobile data or Wi-Fi connection. 5InControl features, options and their availability remain market dependent - check for local market availability and full terms. Certain features require an appropriate sim with a suitable data contract which will require further subscription after the initial term advised by your Retailer. Mobile connectivity cannot be guaranteed in all locations."
