This systematic review comprehensively appraises the policies and strategies on air pollutants controls enacted in different countries, worldwide. Three databases, Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus, were used for the search. After screening, a total of 114 eligible manuscripts were selected from 2219 documents for further analysis. Selected articles were divided into two categories: (1) articles focusing on introducing the policies and strategies enacted for controlling air pollution in different countries, and (2) articles which focused on different policies and strategies to control one or more specific pollutants. In the former one, urban air pollution control strategies and policies were divided into four categories, namely, general strategies and policies, transportation, energy, and industry. In case of latter category, policies and strategies focused on controlling six pollutants (PM, SO2, NO2, VOCS, O3 and photochemical smog). The results indicated that, the most common policies and strategies enacted in most countries are pertinent to the transportation sector. Changing energy sources, in particular elimination or limited use of solid fuels, was reported as an effective action by governments to reduce air pollution. Overall, most policies enacted by governments can be divided into three general categories: (a) incentive policies such as implementing a free public transportation program to use fewer private cars, (b) supportive policies such as paying subsidies to change household fuels, and (c) punitive policies such as collecting tolls for cars to enter the congestion charging areas. Depending on the circumstances, these policies are implemented alone or jointly. In addition to the acceptance of international agreements to reduce air pollution by governments, greater use of renewable energy, clean fuels, and low-pollution or no-pollution vehicles such as electric vehicles play an important role in reducing air pollution.\n\nKeywords: Air quality, Strategy, Policy, Intervention, Air pollutants\n\nIntroduction\n\nNowadays, air pollution is known to be closely related to economic growth, population and energy consumption. There is a chain relation among the maintenance of economic development and improvement the living standards, population growth, increased demand for energy, and increasing the production and emission of air pollutants. Air pollution is considered as a serious issue; it causes different concern including climate changes, biodiversity reduction, affects crops and agricultural production and soil acidification [1, 2]. According to WHO reports (2016), 4.2 million premature deaths were attributed to air pollution in both developed and developing countries; 91% premature deaths are observed in low- and middle-income countries including South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions [3]. The studies indicate that people living in low-level social-economic regions encountered with high level of air pollutants concentrations in ambient air [4–10]. A variety of diseases including respiratory diseases (asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia), different types of allergies, disturbances of the central nervous system, and circulatory problems are attributed to air pollution [11–17].\n\nRoad transportation are known as the main source for air pollution. In addition, domestic, commercial, and industrial activities may also cause air pollution. It is reported that more than 70–80% of air pollution in large cities in developing countries are attributed to greenhouse gas emissions from a large number of worn-out vehicles combined with poor vehicle maintenance, poor road structure, and poor fuel quality [18–24]. According to WHO report (2016), 91% of the world's population experienced the air with quality lower than the standard values [3]. The key air pollutants are: particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and (O3) [25]. The major sources of air pollution, their corresponding health effects and standard values recommended are summarized in Table .\n\nTable 1\n\nPollutantSourcesHealth effectsLimits/guidelinesWHO (WHO, 2006)U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2012)PMTransport (including exhaust fumes and tire and brake wear), combustion, industrial processes, construction and demolition, wind erosionbreathing problems, the increase of cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality, reduced lung functions in children and adults leading to asthmatic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary mortality\n\nPM2.5(μg m−3):\n\n24-h mean = 25\n\nAnnual mean = 10\n\nPM2.5(μg m−3):\n\n24-h mean = 35\n\nAnnual mean = 15\n\nPM10(μg m−3):\n\n24-h mean = 50\n\nAnnual mean = 20\n\nPM10(μg m−3):\n\n24-h mean = 150\n\nAnnual mean = -\n\nNO2Combustion processes (heating, power generation, and engines in vehicles and ships)Coughing, wheezing, eyes, nose or throat irritations, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, diaphoresis, fever, bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema\n\nNO2(μg m−3):\n\n1 h mean = 200\n\nAnnual mean = 40\n\nNO2(ppb):\n\n1 h mean = 100\n\nAnnual mean = 53\n\nSO2Use of sulfur-containing fossil fuels for domestic use, power generation and vehiclesProblems in the respiratory system and the functions of the lungs, irritation of the eyes, inflammation of the respiratory tract leading to cough, mucus secretion, aggravation of asthma and chronic bronchitis\n\nUnit:μg m−3\n\n24-h mean = 20\n\n10-min mean = 500\n\nUnit: ppb\n\n1 h mean = 75\n\n3-h mean = 500\n\n24-h mean = 140\n\nAnnual mean = 30\n\nO3Photochemical reaction of NOx from industrial sources and vehicles with VOCs emitted by automobiles, industrial sources, and solventsBreathing problems, trigger asthma, reduction of lung functions, lung diseases\n\nUnit: μg m−3\n\n8-h mean = 100\n\nUnit: ppb\n\n8-h mean = 75\n\n1 h mean = 120\n\nThe basic and inherent advantages of establishment the legislations, strategies, and policies in the fields of air pollution are preventive measurement and requirement to control the air pollution in emission sources, improving the air quality and avoiding negative health outcomes. Air pollution control efforts dates back to more than a century. The Chicago legislation (1881), smoke abatement in Boston in the States of America (1910–1912) and Clean Air Act (1925) following “Great London Smog” in the UK are the earliest strategies for air pollution control [26–28]. However, afterwards, a series of legislations and programs have been enacted at the international level and some at the national and local levels. International actions such as the Paris Agreement (2015) recommend to the countries; it recommends governmental authorities to lower the increasing global warming and temperature below 2 °C and to in particular prevent dangerous impacts of climate change [29, 30]. At the continental level, European Union (EU) Directives enacted the values guidelines for air pollutants and the convention on long-range trans-boundary air pollution (CLRTAP) and protocols related to emission reductions for specific air pollutants [31, 32]. In case of local preventive air pollution actions, Prohibition of solid fuel use in homes, low emission zones (LEZs) and the introduction of vehicle exhaust catalysts (VECs) are the most common approaches [27, 33, 34].\n\nThe purpose of this study was to comprehensively cover the strategies and policies that governments have enacted to improve air quality or urban air pollution control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global systematic review on urban air pollution control policies and strategies with this number of countries; it can contribute to advance the knowledge in this field.\n\nMethods\n\nSearch strategy\n\nThe present systematic review was performed according to standard methods the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [35]. A comprehensive screening approach to find the urban air pollution control strategies and policies published in peer-reviewed journal was performed up to 19 January 2021 in three scientific databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The selected keywords included “air pollut*” OR “atmospheric pollut*” OR “air contaminant*” OR “polluted air” OR “air quality” OR “outdoor air pollut*” OR “ambient air pollut*” OR “atmospheric pollut*”AND “Control policy” OR “Control management” OR “Control strateg*” OR “intervention plan*”. Based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, the most relevant articles were selected. The search was limited to the English language. We also searched the references lists of qualified articles and grey literature databases to find additional pertinent studies.\n\nStudy selection, eligibility criteria, and data extraction\n\nBriefly, four sequential steps were performed to select the eligible manuscripts (Fig. ). First, the selected manuscripts were entered into the EndNote X8. Second step was removing the duplicated studies. Third, the eligibility of articles were screened by the titles and abstracts of the remaining articles were reviewed for suitability. Fourth, the full texts of the potentially eligible manuscripts were evaluated to meet the aim of present systematic review. Finally, the selected study was throughoutly screened to meet the inclusion criteria mentioned in Table The extracted data from the selected articles cover the following items: urban air pollution control policies and strategies, country, geographical location, start time or period time covered, authors' names, publication year, title, type of pollutant.\n\nTable 2\n\nInclusionExclusionAll articles written in English languageNon-English, even with English abstractScientific peer-reviewed articles, including conference articlesPapers on indoor air pollution control interventionsPublished No restrictions in the city or countryPublished articles that contain only comments or suggestions or scenarios written by researchersArticles published before 19 January 2021Papers focusing on ambient air pollution\n\nResults and discussion\n\nCharacteristics of literature\n\nAfter removing the duplicates, 2219 documents remained for review based on titles and abstracts (Fig. ). The full texts of 515 relevant documents were retrieved. Finally, 114 documents were selected according to inclusion criteria. The articles were divided into two categories. The first category articles include urban air pollution control strategies and policies based on geographical location (Table ), the second category articles include urban air pollution control strategies and policies based on the type of pollutant (Table ). Out of 114 final articles selected, 81 articles were placed in the first category and 33 articles in the second category.\n\nTable 3\n\nCountryLocationTime Period\n\nCoveredStrategy/policyStudy &\n\npublication year\n\nReferenceChinaBeijingSince the mid-1990s-2009\n\nOutflow control on in-use and modern vehicles; Improving the quality of fuel consumption; Use of alternative and upgraded fuel in cars; Economic programs; Public transportation; Traffic control in high traffic times, a summary of emission standards for new cars adopted in Beijing\n\nlight-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) Euro1:1999.1.1 Euro2: 2003.1.1, Euro3:2005.12.30 (OBD 2006.12.1), Euro4:2008.3.1, Heavy-duty gasoline vehicle (HDGV) Euro1:2002.7.1 Euro2: 2003.9.1, Euro3:2009.7.1, Heavy-duty diesel vehicle (HDDV) Euro1:2000.1.1 Euro2: 2003.1.1, Euro3:2005.12.30, Euro4:2008.7.1\n\nMotorcycle (MC) Euro1:2001.1.1 Euro2: 2004.1.1, Euro3:20085.7.1\n\nWu et al.

In general, the selected studies were classified in two categories: (1) studies focused on introduction the policies and strategies to control air pollution in different countries of the world, and (2) articles focused on different policies and strategies to control one or more specific pollutants.\n\nStrategies and policies for urban air pollution control, categorized based on geographical locations\n\nIn this section, urban air pollution control strategies and policies were classified into four categories, namely, general strategies and policies, transportation, energy, and industry.\n\nGeneral strategies and policies\n\nThe most important regulations, general strategies and policies to air pollution control enacted in different countries are as follows: (See Table ).\n\nClean air action [48–50], clean air act (CAA) [27, 72, 86, 98, 114], air pollution control act (APCA) [55], Environmental Protection Law [102], the atmospheric pollution prevention act (APPA), Air Quality Act and the National Framework for Air Quality Management in South Africa [111], The Third Development Plan of Economy, Social and Cultural of the Country and Integrated Master Plan of Air Pollution Control [72], the Air Pollution Control Action Plan (APCAP) and 13th Five-Year Plan (13th FYP) [52], the Blue-Sky Defense War and Environmental Protection Tax Law [54], Comprehensive Action issued and Improve environmental law [48–50], Comprehensive Urban Air Quality Control Strategy [81], Air Quality Management Plan [84], Road Vehicles Act [69], Smoke and Soot Law, Establishment of the Basic Environmental Pollution Control and Establishment of the Air Pollution Control Act [70], the PCDD/PCDF Emission Standard for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Incinerators and Subsidize Local Governments to Accomplish Air Quality Improvement Programs [55], Expanding the Existing Smoky Vehicle Program [58], National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act [62–64], National Clean Air Program [65], the Comprehensive Survey on Air Pollution [61], the Clean Air Act Amendments [76, 77], Clean Fuels Program [84], the low for open burning of waste (outdoor) [62–64].\n\nEconomic policies [36, 48–50], economic incentive policy [69], reduce carbon emissions [53], reforestation program [33], restriction on use of DG (diesel generator) sets [68], distribution of educational leaflets [75], emissions tax [76, 77, 105], subsidy for expenditure on abatement capital [76, 77], joint prevention and control of regional air pollution [51], reducing regional emission sources of gaseous pollutants [41], adjusting the economy to balanced development and industrialization and urbanization [42], strengthen government governance responsibilities and implement environmental supervision actions [54], SO2 taxation [44], Prohibit all open burning [38, 89], prohibition in “backyard” refuse burning [27].\n\nAir pollution control regulations and policies have been enacted in many countries around the world; most cases had positive consequences. For example, in a study focused on the impact of the Blue-Sky Defense War law in China, a 14.49 and 23.43 μg m−3 reduction in the monthly average concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 were obtained [54]. Zhang et al. (year) showed that over the 40-year period in the UK, PM2.5 and NO2- attributed mortalities were reduced by 56% and 44% respectively. While, the O3- attributable mortalities experienced an increase of 17% over the same period [115]. It has also been shown that the most effective way to control air pollution, especially greenhouse gases, is to accept and implement international agreements such as the Paris Agreement [116].\n\nA preliminary analysis in the United States (1975) indicated that emissions tax and an increase in the gasoline tax were more effective than emission standards [77]. China in 2005 performed a comprehensive control policy in order to control the multiple pollutants (SO2, NO2, VOC and PM) emissions and emission sources in local and regional levels [51]. The results of study Streit in Mexico City showed that the prohibition of all open burning, implemented in 1993, significantly reduced CO, HCs, and NO2 emission compared to other pollutants [89].\n\nStrategies and policies related to transport\n\nThe most common measurements for air pollution control with special focus on transportation are divided into four categories: improving infrastructure and transportation structure, control measures on vehicles, fuel quality improvements and alternative fuels, and traffic restrictions.\n\nImproving infrastructure and transportation structure.\n\nThe most important measures related to the improvement of infrastructure and transportation structure to control air pollution are as follows (See Table ):\n\nImprovement of road structure [69], adjustment the transportation structure and building a green transportation system [54], transportation mode modification [27], expansion of public transportation [87, 113], public transport, improvement and promotion the public transport [36, 62–64], allowing for temporary free public transport [34], phasing out of worn-out vehicles [33, 67], Phasing out of worn-out Two-wheeled engines [67], retirement of older diesel trucks and buses in urban areas [71], elimination of motorcycles and substandard vehicles [43], retire old vehicles [48–50], elimination of “yellow-brand” vehicles [45, 48–50], obsoleting vehicles with earlier emission standards [40], optimize the traffic control strategies [46], install enough numbers of parking meter [72], imposing higher parking fees [34], advanced vehicles [36], public awareness of traffic [72], make strict standards for new vehicles [48–50], temporal traffic control measure [36, 48–50], control of imported cars [72], banning of imported used cars [61–64], electric vehicle incentive program [62–64], growth in rail transit infrastructure [39], construction of underground lines [72], expansion of the Subway [89].\n\nCongestion is considered as one of the most important concern in large cities. Traffic congestion causes high costs, delays, and increased fuel consumption; it has unpleasant social and environmental consequences [117]. One of the most important policies and strategies related to transportation is recommendation for less use of private cars and more use of public transportation and bicycles. A study conducted by Rojas-Rueda, et al. in Barcelona (Spain) revealed that 40% decrease in car trips would prevent 10.03 deaths, due to a 0.64% reduction in exposure to PM2.5 [118]. In San Francisco, some incentives are considered for the employers to less use of private cars, public transport use and bicycle uses; the people are given some subsides or pre-tax deductions of transport costs [119]. The establishment of subways in cities as a means of public transportation has a major impact on reducing air pollution. For instance, since 2005, Beijing has experienced a rapid growth in rail transportation infrastructure and improved air quality. The results showed that the operation of the rail transit system has a great effect on reducing most of the air pollutants concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO), however, it has little effect on the reduction of O3 pollution [39]. Incentive programs such as free public transport, and restrictive programs such as increasing parking fees can reduce air pollution in cities. In Oslo, increases in parking fees were the most effective measurements to control the air pollution in Norway (2011) [34].\n\nControl measures on vehicles.\n\nThe most important control measures on vehicles to control air pollution listed in Table , are as follows:\n\nEmission control on in-use and new vehicles [36], tightening vehicle emission standards [51, 57–59, 61, 62, 72, 76, 94], the installation of either diesel particulate filters (DPF) or diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) on all diesel-powered trucks, buses [71], convert delivery trucks to LP gas and install catalytic converters [53], use of catalytic converters [33, 67, 72], use of three-way vehicle exhaust catalytic converters (VECs) [97], retrofit in-use vehicles [48–50], retrofitting emission control devices [59], motorcycle (and Similar) Emission Control Program [90], retrofit carbureted LDGVs [37].\n\nFocusing on vehicle emission restrictions is more important than on urban air quality restrictions. Therefore, stricter standards are mainly considered for new cars [67]. Standards are a series of driving cycle emission regulations enacted for control the air pollutants emitted from the light- and heavy-duty vehicles and motorcycles [36]. Although vehicle emission control strategies can be easily proposed, however, they are hard to implement due to their dependency on the public acceptance and support [61]. Euro emission standards are one of the most important measures that governments plan and implement to control vehicle emissions. In Beijing, for example, from 1999 to 2008, Euro 1 to 4 standards were planned and implemented for variety of vehicles [36]. Vehicle Exhaust Catalysts (VECs) was enacted to control or reduce the many air pollutants (NOx, VOCs and CO) emitted from the petrol-fueled vehicles. The results of study conducted by Hutchinson in the UK in 2004 reported that VECs significantly reduce the concentration of pollutants: NO2 (20%), PM10 (10%), VOCs (30%) and CO (70%) [97]. In diesel vehicles, the traditional Diesel Catalyst Oxidation (DOC) has been employed to decrease the concentration of THC and CO. In addition, Diesel Particle Filters (DPF) and Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) systems have been also employed to reduce the particle and NOx emissions, respectively [120, 121]. In a study focused on investigation the contribution of a new generation diesel light-duty vehicles (Euro 6) on the urban air quality, the results showed a 60% decrease in NO2 emissions [122].\n\nFuel quality improvements and alternative fuels.\n\nThe most important measurements related to fuel quality improvements and the use of alternative fuels to control air pollution are listed in Table :\n\nFuel quality improvements or raising fuel standards or updating vehicle fuel standards [36, 40, 43, 45, 48–50, 57–59, 62, 73, 89, 94], complete removal of leaded petrol [67, 72], diesel with low Sulfur content [90], the use of alternative fuels [36, 81, 83, 87, 91, 102], the use of ethanol derived from sugar cane [90], switching diesel vehicles to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles [59], increased use of alternative fuels (CNG, LNG) [45, 48–50], the use of CNG as a cleaner fuel in vehicles [65, 67, 73, 90], the use of electric vehicles powered by batteries or fuel cells and use of cleaner-burning fuels (such as methanol) [84], shifting the public transport buses from diesel to CNG [62], bio-fuel vehicle, Hybrid vehicle, Electric vehicle, LPG [73], buses to switch over to CNG or other clean fuel [67, 72] promotion of biofuels [62–64].\n\nSeveral studies have confirmed the relationship between fuel quality and air pollution [123–125]. One of the preconditions for adopting emission standards is to improve the fuel quality. As an example, the removal of Lead (Pb) from gasoline is the main prerequisite for accepting the Euro 1 standard [36]. Using alternative fuels instead of fossil fuels is an important step in reducing urban air pollution. Brazil uses fuels such as sugar cane-derived ethanol and compressed natural gas on a large scale as gasoline alternatives. More than 50% of the fuel used in Brazilian light vehicles is ethanol [90]. In 1999, buses running on CNG were introduced into the Beijing bus fleet [36]. Hybrid and electric vehicles are a good alternative to fossil fuel vehicles and are effective in reducing air pollution. Many of the biggest automobile producers have been producing hybrid and electric vehicles for years, and very countries like China, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, India, Japan, Malaysia use them [73, 126].\n\nTraffic restrictions.\n\nThe most important measurements related to Traffic restrictions to control air pollution listed in Table , are as follows:\n\nEstablishing restricted area in the center of the city [72], implementation of LEZ [34, 87, 92, 99, 101], increasing the tolls that give access to the inner parts of the city [34], by-pass construction in the congested area [100], environmental optimization of traffic signal timings [109], other vehicle restrictions [88], restrictions on the use of private cars [47], restriction on entry of truck traffic [68], enforcement of odd–even scheme for private cars [34, 68], defining priority lanes for low emission vehicles [34].\n\nOne of the control measurements that has attracted a lot of attention in many industrialized countries is LEZ. The use of vehicles is restricted in these areas, mostly in the city centers and crowded places of the city. In some cities, LEZ is considered for diesel-burning heavy-duty vehicles. However, some of these restrictions are also being applied to other types of vehicles, such as very old and polluting vehicles. In some countries such as England, Germany, and the Netherlands, vehicles are assigned a sticker (red, yellow, or green) according to the tax class and Euro emission standard. In some countries, only vehicles with certain emission standards and with the relevant label are allowed to enter to the special zone [95, 127]. Numerous studies have been investigated to analyze the influence of LEZ on air quality. Most of them declared the LEZ to be effective in reducing the concentration of air pollutants [99, 101, 128, 129]. The results of study conducted by Cesaroni in 2012 Rome reported that implementation the LEZ approach have been reduced the NO2 and PM10 concentrations by 23 and 10%, respectively. However, the reductions were mostly in the intervention area not the whole city [92]. Congestion charging areas are defined as areas of the city that have special rules for entering them, such as paying tolls. There is evidence that congestion charging improves the air quality via behavior changes including using public transportation instead of private car [130]. In Oslo, Norway, since 2017, in the congestion charging zones, vehicles pay different prices depending on the type of fuel, the EURO standard, type of car (heavy, light), and time of day (rush hour, not rush hour). Of course, Electric vehicles can pass free in this area [34]. The odd–even scheme for private vehicles based on license plate numbers is one of the traffic restrictions which is usually applied in the case of emergency air pollution and temporarily for some big cities in a larger geographical area than other traffic restrictions [34, 68].\n\nStrategies and policies related to energy\n\nThe most important measurements related to energy consumption for control air pollution listed in Table , are as follows:\n\nCleaner energy use [38, 51, 54], energy efficient (EE) improvement [44, 48, 106], energy saving [106], energy replacement [43], use of solar energy [84], clean technologies such as the fuel cell [85], utilizing the clean coal [48–51, 56], coal control in electricity generation sector [40], increasing clean energy alternatives such as coal-to-gas or coal-to-electricity, elimination of civil bulk coal consumption and adjusting and optimizing the energy structure [48–50], the use of renewables and nuclear energy [62–64], cleaner cooking fuels (i. e. LPG, electricity) and cleaner cook stoves [62–64], wood heater replacement program [75], restriction on the use of coal by residential, and commercial sources [78], changes in the price of electricity and shifts in coal usage [82], control of domestic heating [91], tax on a single fuel, such as coal and ban on coal use [105], banning the marketing, sale, and distribution of bituminous coal [107, 108], signing the natural gas agreement with the former USSR and banning the use of poor quality lignite [103], restriction on use of coal/wood-based tandoor in restaurants and street eateries [68], taxes on wood consumption for heating and cooking and subsidies for more efficient combustion technologies [112], a 70% subsidy for the cost of coal heater replacement with a clean-burning, solid fuel replacement, using only a certain type of fuel and formation of foundation [27].\n\nEnergy is an integral part of human life. Energy sources have a lot of changes due to the advancement of science and technology. Coal is one of the energy sources used for many years in both industry and home heating. The residential coal-burning was known as the most probable source of pollutants for the London Smog. This disaster caused 4000 excess deaths in one week in the London area in1952 [27]. Two of the most important actions in the UK government after this catastrophe were approval of the Clean Air Act in 1956 and allocating 70% subsidies to replace coal fuel heaters with clean fuel heaters. The contribution of the federal government for controlling the air pollution was calculated to be 40%, while the contribution of local government were the remaining 30% [131]. Other countries also take good measures to remove coal, especially from home use. The Turkish government signed a natural gas agreement with the former USSR in 1984. Distribution of the natural gas started in Istanbul in January 1992 and the use of poor-quality lignite was banned in late 1993 [103]. Wood stoves became increasingly the popular for home heating in Tasmania, Australia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In this regard, some studies were conducted from 1991 to 1993, and results indicated that the main source of air pollution was solid fuel. The government improved air quality by allocating funds to replace electricity instead of solid fuel [75]. In 2013, it was reported that coal in China is still the main source of energy, unlike other developed countries in the world. Approximately 52% of coal in China is consumed in the electricity generation sector [53]. The results of a study in Dublin, Ireland reported that after banning coal sales, the average black smoke concentrations, adjusted non-trauma death rates, respiratory deaths and cardiovascular deaths declined by 70%, 5.7%, 5.15%, 10.3%, respectively [107]. Clean technical advances (CTP), energy efficient (EE) improvement, and energy savings, in addition to socioeconomic impacts, can reduce emissions of SO2, CO2, and PM2.5 [44].\n\nStrategies and policies related to the industry\n\nThe most important measurements related to the industry for control air pollution listed in Table , are as follows:\n\nIndustrial structure improvement [38, 48–50, 54, 91], adjustment of industrial structure [48–50], installation of control equipment on industrial and commercial boilers [33], required use of abatement equipment [76, 77], measures in connection with the licensing procedures for industrial plants [93], the substantial elevation of emissions fees and fines [104], the (re)location of industrial facilities [47, 87], elimination or upgrading industries with excessive, backward, and polluting industries, reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emission, promote cleaner production (CP) and accelerate the technological transformation and improve innovation capability [48–50], tightening exhaust emission standards for industry [57], use of higher chimney [27, 91], stopping some factories in a pollution emergency [48–50, 87], use of high efficiency electrostatic precipitator technology in large coal-based power plants and emission regulations for industries [62–64].\n\nThe presence of industries near the cities and the emission of various pollutants have made governments to enact strict laws and policies in order to control air pollution caused by industries. Due to the antiquity of some industries and the advancement of scientific knowledge, improving the industrial structure is considered the most important and effective measurement for reduction the urban air pollution [38, 48–50, 91]. Implementation the industrial structure improvement and regulation policies in Jinan and China, reduced SO2 and NO2 emissions by 37.51% and 7.47%, respectively [49]. Licensing procedures for industrial plants, the substantial elevation of pollutants emission fines, and stopping some factories in a pollution emergency are other useful measures to significantly reduce air pollution [48–50, 87, 93, 104]. Of course, every industry should have control measures according to the type of environmental pollutants [48], which is not discussed in this article.\n\nStrategies and policies for urban air pollution control, categorized based on the type of pollutant\n\nThe urban air pollution control strategies and policies with focus on six categories based on the types of pollutants such as PM, SO2, NO2, VOCS, O3, and photochemical smog are listed in Table .\n\nThe most important measures to PM control\n\nReduction the nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) [132], fuel quality improvements [133, 140], school and governmental sector closure, shutdowns of construction works, and traffic limitation (at the time of air pollution) [133], low emission zones (LEZ) [134, 141], traffic management and improved public transport [134, 137], control of open biomass burning and fossil- fuel combustion [135], electrifying public transportation, upgrading coal-fired power plants [115], eliminating small coal-fired boilers, phasing out small high-emitting factories [136], the odd–even car scheme [138], coal consumption reduction, energy structure reconstruction tighter emission rules, improvement of the industrial and motor vehicle waste control techniques [139], industrial source controls, targeted mobile source controls, street sweeping, road paving, general mobile source controls, general fugitive control strategies [140], restrict speed, treat unpaved access roads, required use of abatement equipment in industry [143], reduce emissions from old, diesel vehicles, increase the use of eco-friendly vehicles including electric cars and hydrogen cars [142].\n\nA variety of air pollutant, in particular, PM adversely affect the quality of Urban air. Among major contaminants, fine particulates due to adverse health effects has drawn much attention [163, 164]. In the case of air pollution, governments often use both short-term and long-term strategies. For example in Iran, government have made such effort to control the via implementing the temporary urgent control strategies including as shutdowns of construction works and traffic restrictions and school and governmental sector closure, [133]. Control measures in transportation can reduce concentration of particulate matter. The results of a study on the low emission zones in Germany showed that after implementation of LEZ in Cologne, Berlin, and Munich in a short time, the PM10 concentration considerably decreased. A significant reduction in PM2.5 related to traffic-related particle fraction was observed in Munich [141]. Implementation of the odd–even car trial scheme in India in 2016 showed that the average hourly rates of PM2.5 and PM10 decreased by 74% compared to the corresponding hours during the previous year [138]. The results of a study conducted in eastern China indicated that the most important factors influencing PM2.5 concentration are controlling the open biomass burning and fossil-fuel combustion [135]. Depending on the origin of the particulate matter, controlling other pollutants can also reduce its concentration. For instance, research on air pollution control measures in Los Angeles showed that controls of SOx applied to the base emissions inventory decreased the average PM2.5 concentrations by 1.2 µg m−3. The ammonia control measures reduced daily PM2.5 concentrations by 10.9 µg m−3 in comparison with its base concentrations [143].\n\nThe most important measures to SO2 control\n\nRegional Clean Air Incentives Market, electric vehicles [143] reducing the sulfur content of the fuel [143, 145, 147], fuel desulfurization, substitution with low-sulfur alternatives, industrial structural change, production process efficiency [144], promoting efficient energy use [145–147], sulfur tax [146], closing small and high-emitting power plants [147], installing flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment in all the power plants [147, 148], burning low sulfur western coal [148], fuel switching, load shifting, environmental dispatch or intermittent controls [149]. Most of the control measures for reducing the SO2 emission are related to the improvement and modification of the energy efficiency. Changing the energy structure with a significant reduction in coal consumption and the use of alternative fuels such as natural gas and electricity has been the most important measure to reduce SO2 emissions [48]. Increasing energy efficiency from 2005 to 2008 and measures such as closing small and high-emitting power plants, installation of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment in all power plants, emission control from boilers and kilns, promotion of cleaner production, and using fuel with lower sulfur contents in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China reduced SO2 concentration by 39% between 2006 and 2009 [147]. Improving and changing the vehicle fuel and the use of electric vehicles are other important measures to reduce SO2 emissions [143].\n\nThe most important measures to NO2 control\n\nVehicle emission standards, inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, scrappaging and old vehicle retrofitting practices, gasoline quality improvement, controlling non-road engines, alternative-fuel vehicles [150], the natural gas vehicle supply (NGVS) program, use of diesel particulate filter (DPF) or diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), cash incentives or tax reductions for the vehicles of low pollutant emissions and hybrid fuel [151]. Electrify stationary no generating internal combustion engines and turbines, eliminate planned fires, selective catalytic reduction in petroleum refinery, radiant burners; alternative fuels in small boilers and process heaters [143].\n\nVehicles (especially privatized cars and motorcycles) contribute between 30 and 75% of the total NOx emissions in cities, therefore, most measures to reduce NO2 emissions in urban areas are related to transportation [165–167]. A study focused on NO2 trend in the long-term period alongside 16 urban roadside locations in 7 major Korean cities over 11-year period (1998–2008). The use of low emission diesel engines and natural gas-burning vehicles program were considered as key emission control strategies since June 2000. The results showed that NO2 levels decreased over 11 years due to the combined effects of control strategies [151]. Energy-related control measures comprise the use of natural gas for conservation of commercial and residential energy. Important measures taken in the industry to reduce NO2 emissions include the use of selective catalytic converters, the elimination of radiant burners, the improvement of combustion, and the use of alternative fuels instead of highly polluting fossil fuels [143].\n\nThe most important measures to VOCS control\n\nChange from diesel to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), use of catalytic converter replacement [152], reduce the use of solvents, reduce the VOCs of vehicle exhaust [153].\n\nThe most important sources of VOCs emission are biological resources, vehicles, and industries. After industrial revolution in the eighteenth century, the spread of VOCs gradually increased in cities. [168]. In the light of industrial revolution and controlling measurement for VOCs, most public light buses and taxies in Hong Kong were modified from the diesel-burning buses to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel type in the early 2000s. The government carried out an LPG catalytic converter replacement program (CCRP) from October 2013 to April 2014 which reduced VOCs by 36.7% [152]. Reducing solvent use and vehicle exhaust VOCs have been implemented in the Korean metropolis of Seoul since 2005 as appropriate strategies for reducing VOCs [153]. While the local reduction of nitrous oxides was the main controlling strategy for ozone in the Macon, Georgia in 2004 [158].\n\nThe most important measures to O3 control\n\nProgressive and more stringent controls on emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [154], ozone control of four source categories including electric utility point sources, nonutility (industrial) point sources, highway vehicles, and non-road mobile sources [155], vapor control in gasoline marketing [156], cleaner emission standards on newer cars according to the Clean Air Act [157], achieve ozone standards [158], restricting heavy-duty diesel trucks from driving within urban areas during the daytime in major cities [159], reduction of both NOx and VOC anthropogenic emissions, circulation on alternate days of vehicles with odd and even number plates, traffic restrictions on some roads, closure of industries, reduction in the operation regime of some industries [160].\n\nOzone in the Earth's atmosphere is produced by the photochemical reactions of NOx and VOCs in the presence of sunlight. The relationship between ozone formation and concentration of its precursors is nonlinear [169–171]. The rate of ozone formation depends on the NOx concentration and the VOC/NOx ratio [154]. To achieve the national standard for ambient air quality for ozone, the US government implemented different preventive measurements: uses of low solvent technologies and/or add-on control equipment for surface coating operations, vapor control in gasoline marketing, maintenance programs for proper VOCs control as the procedures for ozone, and vehicle inspection [156]. Implementation the strict limitation for driving the heavy-duty diesel trucks in urban areas during the daytime in several major Chinese cities in 2006 reduced ozone by about 25 and 20 ppb at night and day, respectively [159].\n\nThe most important measures to photochemical smog control\n\nAmbient air standards, emission standards, and applying appropriate control techniques [162].\n\nPhotochemical smog was first detected in Los Angeles. The main influencing factor for this phenomenon was emission of air pollutants from different plants (power plants, smelters, foundries, open dumps, incinerators), and the release of sulfur oxides from different refineries. Adoption of emission standards regarding the control of vehicles and industry was one of the most important measures taken by the government to solve the problem of photochemical smog [162].\n\nConclusions\n\nA systematic review was conducted to identify policies and strategies to control urban air pollution without restrictions in countries and time. In this study, the selected articles were divided into two categories: (1) that introduce policies and strategies to control air pollution in different countries of the world, and (2) articles that introduce different policies and strategies to control one or more specific pollutants. In the first category, urban air pollution control strategies and policies were classified into four categories, namely focusing on general strategies and policies, transportation, energy and Industry. In the second category, policies and strategies focused on controlling six pollutants (PM, SO2, NO2, VOCS, Ozone and photochemical smog).\n\nLegislations and policy interventions to control urban air pollution are commonly enacted and implemented in most of the large countries in the world. Policies used by governments to control air pollution can be encouraging, supportive, or punitive. Depending on the circumstances, these policies are implemented alone or jointly.\n\nThe largest share of air pollution, especially in large cities, is related to transportation [172]. According to our investigations, the number of articles covering transportation control strategies and policies is higher than other topics. Important policies and strategies related to transportation include the use of technology to improve vehicle efficiency, improve transportation structure, use of emission standards, fuel quality improvements and alternative fuels, traffic restrictions, and use of less polluting vehicles such as hybrid vehicles and electric. Preliminary studies on energy-related air pollution control policies and strategies have focused on eliminating solid fuels, especially coal, and shifting fuel from coal to cleaner energy sources such as electricity and natural gas. This fuel shift has taken place in many countries for domestic use. But some governments in recent years have defined policies and strategies to remove coal from industry, especially power plants, which show that coal is still an important fuel in those countries. In recent years the approach of some countries is to use cleaner energies such as solar and wind energies. Installation of air pollution control systems, use of clean energy, use of up-to-date technologies in production, and, if necessary, the relocation of industrial facilities are the most important measures to control urban air pollution related to the industry.\n\nThis study may enhance knowledge about air pollution control interventions. We provided a complete set of implemented policies and strategies by governments to reduce air pollution or improve air quality in various fields to be used by planners and decision makers in this area.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank the Research Center for Environmental Health Technology, Iran University of Medical Sciences for the provision of financial support [Grant No.99-3-61-19814].
