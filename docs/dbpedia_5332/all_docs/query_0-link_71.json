        "text": "California has an , but an electric vehicle transition on that scale may prove to be difficult and expensive for consumers.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board approved a rule last month requiring 100% of new car sales in the nation’s most populous state to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.\n\nWe can solve this climate crisis if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to cut pollution,” Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said . “California now has a groundbreaking, world-leading plan to achieve 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035.”\n\nSuch a transformation would also require at least 15 times more vehicle chargers statewide, according to a report from The Associated Press.\n\n“With the historic $10 billion we’re investing to accelerate the transition to ZEVs, we’re making it easier and cheaper for all Californians to purchase electric cars,” Newsom said.\n\n, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a faculty fellow at Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, says Newsom’s prediction of cheaper electric cars is wrong.\n\nAnd the 2035 timeline?\n\n“It’s not practical,” Mills said.\n\nMills said both electric cars and used, gas-powered cars will cost more in California if this transition takes place just over a decade from now.\n\nAnd it’s not just an issue facing Californians. Other states have indicated they’ll follow California’s lead, and the European Parliament and Canada have also moved toward a ban on the sale of gas-powered cars next decade.\n\nExisting gas-powered cars will be allowed to be driven and resold in California under the announced plan. Mills said that’s likely to send used car prices skyrocketing in California and keep older cars on the road longer as some folks resist the move to electric cars.\n\nThe electric cars themselves will cost more, Mills said. And it all boils down to the costs and ability to mine the resources needed to make the batteries.\n\n“There won’t be enough electric vehicles, because the world is not mining enough materials to make them,” he said.\n\nAn electric car’s battery weighs about 1,000 pounds, compared to about 80 pounds for a full gas tank in a conventional car, Mills said.\n\nBut more importantly, the quantity of materials needed, that have to be mined to produce a single EV battery that weighs 1,000 pounds, you need to dig up about 500,000 pounds of rocks to process and refine the minerals in those rocks to get the key components – nickel, copper, aluminum, cobalt, manganese – the various metals that are needed to make electric car batteries,” Mills said. “Those costs are also been going up. Lithium, in particular, is up something like 700% in the last five or six years.”\n\nMills said a big transition, like the one California is seeking, will see demand outpace supply in a way that sends EV prices higher.\n\n“It’s just an observation of fact that the world is not making enough minerals, no matter how many factories you build,” he said. “You still have to provide the minerals to the factories to make the batteries.”\n\nThe current reality is that electric cars have displaced less than 1% of all oil consumption, he said. Vehicles overall only account for about 30% of all oil use.\n\nMills also contends the California plan won’t have the intended positive impact on the environment.\n\nMines needed for the electric car batteries aren’t in America, so Mills said the increase in demand would mean exporting more jobs and pollution to places like Africa, China, South America, Canada and Australia.\n\nThe mining sector also uses oil and coal to power its operations.\n\n“All the carbon dioxide emissions from digging up the rocks and processing the minerals overseas also emits carbon dioxide,” he said. “It emits enough carbon dioxide ... the emissions you save by not driving a conventional car, half of them are wiped out just building the battery.\n\nPut differently, you have to drive your electric vehicle 50,000 to 60,000 miles before you will pay off the carbon debt that was created to make the battery for that car.”\n\nAn all-electric, or more electric, future may still be feasible, just not as quickly as some would like, Mills said.\n\n“The problem is, policymakers don’t want to be patient and wait for the new technologies,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Mills said hybrid cars with smaller batteries or more fuel-efficient gas-powered cars are a better bet to achieve a reduction in fossil fuel use."
