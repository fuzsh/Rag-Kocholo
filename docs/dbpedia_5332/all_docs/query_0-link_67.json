        "text": "Electric vehicles are taking center stage at the 2024 Washington DC Auto Show.\n\nThis year there are more makes and models to choose from and consumers are trying to familiarize themselves with EVs.\n\n\"There certainly is this great interest in electric vehicles right now. You know, there's over 100 EVs on the market right now... electric vehicles are where the industry is going,\" saidChristopher Wenk, Kia VP Govt. Affairs.\n\nTesla's new Cybertruck is getting a lot of notice, but so is the price tag -- between $61,000 and $100,000. It won't be available until 2025.\n\nRELATED |\n\n\"If you're looking at an electric car, it's going to cost more than an internal combustion engine vehicle...Over time prices certainly will come down,\" saidWenk.\n\nThe auto show is a great opportunity to see all the different options in one place.\n\n\"So if people are interested in an electric or something, maybe a transition to electric, there's a lot of great models out there. Hybrids, plug-in hybrids,\" said Wenk.\n\nBattery life and charging are big considerations for buyers.\n\n\"We do hear about range anxiety. You know, I think that there's a lot of advancements that are happening in terms of batteries and battery range. But I think, you know, the most important part of that conversation from our perspective is charging infrastructure. You know, there needs to be a lot more charging infrastructure,\" said Wenk.\n\nAbout 30,000 more charging stations will be available around the country later this year. And more manufacturers will be able to plug into Tesla's super-charging network.\n\n\"The performance of an electric vehicle is really absolutely remarkable. They are a lot of fun to drive. So I encourage people to just go check them out,\" said Wenk.\n\nThe auto show has an indoor and outdoor driving track available for test drives.\n\nFully Electric vehicles offer a federal tax credit that you'll get at the time of purchase, but only seven models qualify for the full $7,500. credit at this time.\n\nThe DC Auto Show at the Washington Convention Center runs through Sunday, Jan. 28."
