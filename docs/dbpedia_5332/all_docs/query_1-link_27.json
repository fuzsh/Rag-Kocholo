By way of example, this may happen where any of our group companies are incorporated in a country outside of the EEA or if any of our servers or those of our third party service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK.\n\n6.2 If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy.

We will provide this to you electronically in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form, such as a CSV file.\n\nYou can ask us to send your personal information directly to another service provider, and we will do so if this is technically possible. We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if this concerns other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.\n\n8.8 Complaining to the UK data protection regulator\n\nYou have the right to complain to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) if you are concerned about the way we have processed your personal information. Please visit the ICO’s website for further details.\n\n9. SECURITY / COOKIES / LINKS / SOCIAL PLUGINS\n\n9.1 Security measures we put in place to protect your personal information\n\nAll companies within the Mercedes-Benz Group use technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal information supplied by you and managed by us against manipulation, loss, destruction, and access by third parties. Our security measures are continually improved in line with technological developments.\n\nUnfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information whilst in transit to our website and any transmission is at your own risk.\n\nWhere we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access an account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.\n\n9.2 Use of 'cookies'\n\n'Cookies' are small pieces of information sent to your device and stored on its hard drive to allow our websites to recognise you when you visit. Information on the cookies that we use and their features can be found in the cookies section.\n\n9.3 Links to other websites\n\nOur website may contain links to other websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites and Apps‚ so we encourage you to read their privacy statements. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites and Apps (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience. We specifically disclaim responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or thoroughness. Your disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.\n\nIn addition, if you linked to our website from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.\n\n9.4 Third Parties and Social plugins\n\nOur websites may also contain third-party offers. If you click on any such offers, we will transfer the amount of data required to the appropriate provider (e.g. the fact that you found the offer in question on our website and, if applicable, additional information that you have already provided for this purpose on our websites).\n\nOn our websites, whenever we use so-called \"social plugins\" from social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter TikTok, Linked In and YouTube we incorporate them in the manner described below.\n\nWhen you visit our websites, social media plugins are deactivated. That means no information whatsoever is transferred to the operators of those networks. If you wish to use one of the networks, click on the appropriate plugin in order to be connected directly to that network's server.\n\nIf you have a user account with that network and are logged in at the moment you activate the plugin, the network will be able to detect your visit to our websites and assign it to your user account. If you wish to prevent that, please log off from the network before activating the social plugin. A social network will not be able to detect that you have visited other Mercedes-Benz websites unless you have activated its social plugin on those sites as well.\n\nWhen you activate a social plugin, the network transfers the content thus made available directly to your browser, which incorporates it into our websites. In that situation, data transfers initiated and controlled by the respective social network may also take place. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers that take place between the network and your system, and your interactions on that platform are governed exclusively by the respective network's data protection provisions.\n\nThe social plugin will remain active until you deactivate it or delete your cookies.\n\nFurther information on cookies can be found at:- https://www.mercedes-benz.co.uk/passengercars/content-pool/tool-pages/legal/cookies.html Whenever you click on the link to an offer or activate a social plugin, your personal information may be transferred to providers in countries outside the UK or European Economic Area that, from the standpoint of the European Union (\"EU\"), do not guarantee an \"appropriate level of protection\" meeting EU standards for processing personal information. Please keep these circumstances in mind before you click on a link or activate a social plugin, thereby causing your data to be transferred.\n\n10. ANALYSIS OF USER DATA AND USE OF ANALYTICS TOOLS\n\n10.1 We want the content of our websites to match your preferences as closely as possible, thereby improving what we offer you. To identify especially popular areas of our websites, we use the following analysis tools: Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.\n\n10.2 When we employ these analytics tools, information may be transferred to servers located in the US and processed there. Please note the following: From the standpoint of the European Union, the United States does not provide an \"appropriate level of protection\" meeting EU standards for the processing of personal information. However, an equivalent level of protection can be created for individual instances of processing using an appropriate transfer mechanism such as specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe or binding corporate rules.\n\n10.3 If you do not wish us to use the above named analytics tools to collect and analyse information about your visit to our websites, you may permanently object to the practice (opt out) at any time.\n\nWe will comply with your rejection by placing an opt-out cookie in your browser. This cookie will only indicate that you have opted out. Please note that, for technical reasons, an opt-out cookie affects only the browser in which it has been installed. If you delete the cookie or use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out again.\n\n10.4 Below you will find information about the providers of the analytics tools and the respective opt-out procedures:\n\ni.

In other cases you can object to the use of such technologies if you wish (so called opt out see 11.3),\n\n11.2 Use of online marketing products – Opt-in\n\nWe only use online marketing products from Google (e.g. Search Ad, Display & Video 360) and Facebook (so-called “Facebook Pixel”) with your express consent, which you can grant by clicking on the \"Agree\" button in the so-called Cookie Information Layer (\"Opt-in\").

Please use the link on the page requesting your consent to find out more about these third parties.

Your details will be stored, but will not be retained longer than necessary. Your personal data is protected by legal rights which are detailed later in this document.\n\nMBFS may disclose the data provided by or about you to a third party in connection with our corporate finance purposes, which may include granting such third parties the right to receive amounts you owe us.\n\nFor the purposes of (further) development and reporting, the data from past credit checks over the last three months before the final credit decision is processed in pseudonymous form. The credit checks that are performed for corporate customers during the term of the agreement in order to review or adjust the line of credit is also processed in pseudonymous form for this purpose. During the term of the financing agreement, for the purposes of (further) developing risk instruments and reporting, pseudonymous information about your payment history will be processed. This information on your actual payment history during the term of the agreement will be paired with the data from the credit checks\n\nYour Eligibility for Credit\n\nIn order to process your eligibility check, we will perform credit and identity checks with one or more Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). We will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will provide us with information about you.\n\nMBFS uses CRAs to help make its lending decisions and to identify its customers by supplying public and shared credit information.

We may also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your agreement with us.\n\nWe will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will provide us with information about you. CRAs will supply public (such as the electoral register) and shared credit information. This will include information relating to both your financial situation and history in addition to information used for the purposes of fraud prevention.\n\nWe will use this information to:\n\n• Assess your creditworthiness and determine whether you can afford to take the vehicle\n\n• Verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us\n\n• Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering\n\n• Manage your account(s)\n\n• Trace and recover debts\n\n• Ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.\n\nWe will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.\n\nWhen CRAs receive a search from us, they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.\n\nIf you are making a joint application, or inform us that you have a spouse, partner or financial associate, we will link your records together. Please ensure you discuss this with the relevant parties, and share this information with them, before lodging the credit application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or any other individual involved in a joint application successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs.\n\nIf you are making this application as a partner in a firm or as the director of a limited company, MBFS may also carry out searches with credit reference and/or fraud prevention agencies in respect of other partners and directors. By making this application you warrant that your partners or directors understand that MBFS will be carrying out such searches and using their personal information.\n\nThe identities of the CRAs, their role also as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail in the Credit Reference Agency Information Notices (CRAIN).

We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if this concerns other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.\n\n8.3 Correcting and updating your personal information\n\nThe accuracy of your information is important to us and we are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that we hold about you.\n\nIn the meantime, if you change your name or address/email address, or you discover that any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, please let us know by contacting us in any of the details described at the end of this policy.\n\n8.4 Withdrawing your consent\n\nWhere we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information, as set out under How we use your personal information in Section 4, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this policy. If you would like to withdraw your consent to receiving any direct marketing to which you previously opted-in, you can also do so using our unsubscribe tool. If you withdraw your consent, our use of your personal information before you withdraw is still lawful.\n\n8.5 Objecting to our use of your personal information and automated decisions made about you\n\nWhere we rely on our legitimate business interests as the legal basis for processing your personal information for any purpose(s), as out under How we use your personal information in Section 4, you may object to us using your personal information for these purposes by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. Except for the purposes for which we are sure we can continue to process your personal information, we will temporarily stop processing your personal information in line with your objection until we have investigated the matter. If we agree that your objection is justified in accordance with your rights under data protection laws, we will permanently stop using your data for those purposes. Otherwise we will provide you with our justification as to why we need to continue using your data.\n\nYou may object to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes and we will automatically comply with your request. If you would like to do so, please use our unsubscribe tool.\n\nYou may also contest a decision made about you based on automated processing by contacting the data protection department.\n\n8.6 Erasing your personal information or restricting its processing\n\nIn certain circumstances, you may ask for your personal information to be removed from our systems by emailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. Unless there is a reason that the law allows us to use your personal information for longer, we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request.\n\nYou may also ask us to restrict processing your personal information in the following situations:\n\n• where you believe it is unlawful for us to do so,\n\n• you have objected to its use and our investigation is pending or you require us to keep it in connection with legal proceedings.\n\nIn these situations, we may only process your personal information whilst its processing is restricted if we have your consent or are legally permitted to do so, for example for storage purposes, to protect the rights of another individual or company or in connection with legal proceedings.\n\n8.7 Transferring your personal information in a structured data file\n\nWhere we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information or need to process it in connection with your contract, as set out under Section 4 How we use your personal information, you may ask us to provide you with a copy of that information in a structured data file. We will provide this to you electronically in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form, such as a CSV file.\n\nYou can ask us to send your personal information directly to another service provider, and we will do so if this is technically possible. We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if this concerns other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.\n\n8.8 Complaining to the UK data protection regulator\n\nYou have the right to complain to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) if you are concerned about the way we have processed your personal information. Please visit the ICO’s website for further details.\n\n9. SECURITY / COOKIES / LINKS / SOCIAL PLUGINS\n\n9.1 Security measures we put in place to protect your personal information\n\nAll companies within the Mercedes-Benz Group use technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal information supplied by you and managed by us against manipulation, loss, destruction, and access by third parties. Our security measures are continually improved in line with technological developments.\n\nUnfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information whilst in transit to our website and any transmission is at your own risk.\n\nWhere we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access an account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.\n\n9.2 Use of 'cookies'\n\n'Cookies' are small pieces of information sent to your device and stored on its hard drive to allow our websites to recognise you when you visit. Information on the cookies that we use and their features can be found in the cookies section.\n\n9.3 Links to other websites\n\nOur website may contain links to other websites run by other organisations which we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites and Apps‚ so we encourage you to read their privacy statements. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites and Apps (even if you access them using links that we provide) and we provide links to those websites solely for your information and convenience. We specifically disclaim responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or thoroughness. Your disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.\n\nIn addition, if you linked to our website from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.\n\n9.4 Third Parties and Social plugins\n\nOur websites may also contain third-party offers. If you click on any such offers, we will transfer the amount of data required to the appropriate provider (e.g. the fact that you found the offer in question on our website and, if applicable, additional information that you have already provided for this purpose on our websites).\n\nOn our websites, whenever we use so-called \"social plugins\" from social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter TikTok, Linked In and YouTube we incorporate them in the manner described below.\n\nWhen you visit our websites, social media plugins are deactivated. That means no information whatsoever is transferred to the operators of those networks. If you wish to use one of the networks, click on the appropriate plugin in order to be connected directly to that network's server.\n\nIf you have a user account with that network and are logged in at the moment you activate the plugin, the network will be able to detect your visit to our websites and assign it to your user account. If you wish to prevent that, please log off from the network before activating the social plugin. A social network will not be able to detect that you have visited other Mercedes-Benz websites unless you have activated its social plugin on those sites as well.\n\nWhen you activate a social plugin, the network transfers the content thus made available directly to your browser, which incorporates it into our websites. In that situation, data transfers initiated and controlled by the respective social network may also take place. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers that take place between the network and your system, and your interactions on that platform are governed exclusively by the respective network's data protection provisions.\n\nThe social plugin will remain active until you deactivate it or delete your cookies.\n\nFurther information on cookies can be found at: https://www.mercedes-benz.co.uk/passengercars/mercedes-benz-cars/cookies/cookies.module.html\n\nWhenever you click on the link to an offer or activate a social plugin, your personal information may be transferred to providers in countries outside the UK or European Economic Area that, from the standpoint of the European Union (\"EU\"), do not guarantee an \"appropriate level of protection\" meeting EU standards for processing personal information. Please keep these circumstances in mind before you click on a link or activate a social plugin, thereby causing your data to be transferred.\n\n10. ANALYSIS OF USER DATA AND USE OF ANALYTICS TOOLS\n\n10.1 We want the content of our websites to match your preferences as closely as possible, thereby improving what we offer you. To identify especially popular areas of our websites, we use the following analysis tools: Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.2\n\n10.2 When we employ these analytics tools, information may be transferred to servers located in the US and processed there. Please note the following: From the standpoint of the European Union, the United States does not provide an \"appropriate level of protection\" meeting EU standards for the processing of personal information. However, an equivalent level of protection can be created for individual instances of processing using an appropriate transfer mechanism such as specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe or binding corporate rules.\n\n10.3 If you do not wish us to use the above named analytics tools to collect and analyse information about your visit to our websites, you may permanently object to the practice (opt out) at any time.\n\nWe will comply with your rejection by placing an opt-out cookie in your browser. This cookie will only indicate that you have opted out. Please note that, for technical reasons, an opt-out cookie affects only the browser in which it has been installed. If you delete the cookie or use a different browser or device, you will need to opt out again.\n\n10.4 Below you will find information about the providers of the analytics tools and the respective opt-out procedures:\n\ni.

Targeting and Retargeting\n\n11.1 We use so-called targeting, retargeting and cookie-less technologies in order to tailor our online marketing (e.g. banner ads) more specifically to your needs and interests. Adobe Target, Flashtalking by Simplicity Marketing Limited, Google Search Ad, Google Display & Video 360, Facebook Pixel, Salesforce Data Management Platform, Trade Desk from The Trade Desk Inc. These are monitored and used when you visit other websites that work together with the providers of these (re-)targeting technologies, so as to inform you while meeting your interests as closely as possible.\n\nWhen the above technologies are used, cookies on our websites and (in the case of retargeting) on the websites of others register your interest in our products and services. In the process, random identifiers (so-called cookie IDs) are used which are not brought into connection with your name, your address or similar information, even if this information is known to us (e.g. from an existing contractual relationship), unless you have consented to this.\n\nFurther information about the above technologies from the respective providers, and the associated processing of personal data, can be found at the following links:\n\nAdobe: https://www.adobe.com/uk/privacy.html\n\nGoogle: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites\n\nSimplicity Marketing Limited: https://www.flashtalking.com/consumer-privacy\n\nSalesforce Data Management Platform (DMP): https://www.salesforce.com/uk/company/privacy/\n\nTrade Desk from the Trade Desk Inc. https://www.adsrvr.org/\n\nFacebook Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update and https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875\n\nYou can manage and deactivate the use of cookies on the following websites for the technology providers listed there or in your browser as explained in our cookie statement:\n\nhttps://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices\n\nhttps://optout.aboutads.info\n\nDuring the retargeting process, we may also collect information about your interest in the products and services of our retargeting partners.\n\nWhen these targeting and retargeting tools are used, some data may be transferred to servers located in the United States and processed there.\n\nFor legal reasons, the use of tracking and (re-) targeting technologies is sometimes only possible with your express consent (so called opt in see 11.2). In other cases you can object to the use of such technologies if you wish (so called opt out see 11.3),\n\n11.2 Use of online marketing products – Opt-in\n\nWe only use online marketing products from Google (e.g. Search Ad, Display & Video 360) and Facebook (so-called “Facebook Pixel”) with your express consent, which you can grant by clicking on the \"Agree\" button in the so-called Cookie Information Layer (\"Opt-in\"). We store this consent in a cookie on your device so that you are not asked for consent again each time you visit our websites, and for legal reasons, also on our servers with the IP address and a time stamp; we delete this information or restrict its processing if you withdraw your consent or 6 months at the latest after your last visit to our websites.\n\nShould you change your mind at any time, you can withdraw your consent by clicking on the following link:\n\nWithdraw consent to online marketing products from Google and Facebook.\n\nTo delete cookies set with your consent when visiting our websites after your consent to these online marketing products is withdrawn, please visit the following websites or delete the cookies in your browser as explained in our cookies statement:\n\nGoogle: https://adssettings.google.co.uk/anonymous\n\nFacebook and Instagram: http://facebook.com/ads/preferences\n\n12. MARKETING\n\n12.1 We may collect your preferences to send you marketing information directly from us by email/SMS(where applicable) including:\n\n• if you register an account with us online; or\n\n• if you book a test drive or request a call back.\n\nWe will only do so if you have consented to receiving such marketing information directly from us.\n\n12.2 We may contact you with targeted advertising delivered online through social media and platforms (operated by other companies) by using your personal information, or use your personal information to tailor marketing to improve its relevance to you, unless you object.\n\n12.3 We will only share your personal information with recommended third parties for them to contact you with marketing information about their products and services where you have indicated that you would like us to do so. Please use the link on the page requesting your consent to find out more about these third parties. Once shared, the relevant third party’s privacy policy will apply to their processing of your personal information, not ours.

Your details will be stored, but will not be retained longer than necessary. Your personal data is protected by legal rights which are detailed later in this document.\n\nMBFS may disclose the data provided by or about you to a third party in connection with our corporate finance purposes, which may include granting such third parties the right to receive amounts you owe us.\n\nFor the purposes of (further) development and reporting, the data from past credit checks over the last three months before the final credit decision is processed in pseudonymous form. The credit checks that are performed for corporate customers during the term of the agreement in order to review or adjust the line of credit is also processed in pseudonymous form for this purpose. During the term of the financing agreement, for the purposes of (further) developing risk instruments and reporting, pseudonymous information about your payment history will be processed. This information on your actual payment history during the term of the agreement will be paired with the data from the credit checks\n\nYour Eligibility for Credit\n\nIn order to process your eligibility check, we will perform credit and identity checks with one or more Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs).

Please ensure you discuss this with the relevant parties, and share this information with them, before lodging the credit application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or any other individual involved in a joint application successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs.\n\nIf you are making this application as a partner in a firm or as the director of a limited company, MBFS may also carry out searches with credit reference and/or fraud prevention agencies in respect of other partners and directors.
