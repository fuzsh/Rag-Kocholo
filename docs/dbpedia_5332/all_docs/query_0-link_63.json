        "text": "If you own an electric vehicle in Tennessee, get ready to pay more in '24.\n\nIn fact, the annual renewal fee EV drivers have to pay the state has doubled since last year -- from $100 to $200.\n\nDon Warrington, civil mechanical engineering professor at UTC, says...\n\n\"This came to something of a shock, it wasn't well publicized.\"\n\nDon Warrington and his wife both drive hybrid vehicles.\n\n\"For those of us who've been trying to save on energy and save gasoline for the variety of reasons, you know, to get hit with this is kind of a surprise...\" Warrington says.\n\nDon noticed the fee increase while renewing his vehicle, and now they have to pay an additional 100 dollars because of the transportation modernization act.\n\nIn November 2022, Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) Commissioner Butch Eley asked legislators to raise the annual EV registration fee from $100 to $300.\n\nThe reason?\n\nOne of TDOT's main sources of revenue comes from Tennessee's gas tax, but with more drivers choosing electric vehicles and using charging stations, TDOT is not seeing as much money from it anymore.\n\n\"Once it hits some threshold, it's going to really ramp up,\" Eley says.\n\nThis year and next year, EV drivers will pay $200.\n\nBut in 2026, the rate is expected to increase to $274.\n\nThat's based on TDOT's estimation of how much combustion engine drivers spend on average for gas each year.\n\nT-DOT receives money from Tennessee's gas tax, which is 26 cents a gallon.\n\nBut as drivers buy more electric cars, they saw a drop.\n\n\"Every vehicle that's sold in Tennessee is going to take about $200 out of our infrastructure,\" says Joe Galbato, TDOT chief financial officer.\n\nThat money goes to the state's highway fund and towards local communities.\n\nBut drivers like Warrington don't agree with it.\n\n\"I think you could easily prevent people from saying, 'well, I don't want to pay the extra fees.' So they go back to a conventional gasoline car,\" Warrington says.\n\nAnd he believes, as electric vehicles become more affordable to the public, this could hurt drivers in the long run.\n\n\"They've now gotten in the hands of people who the sticker shock of a $100 additional fee may be a serious financial hit for them,\" Warrington says.\n\nTDOT also said they can reserve the right to raise or lower the registration cost by 3 percent each year."
