        "text": "An eccentric Leicestershire petrolhead has shifted gear from classic cars to an iconic vehicle to match his “unique” dress sense. Cormac Boylan has admitted its storage space isn’t ideal for the big weekly shop, though.\n\nMotoring journalist and hospital radio presenter Cormac, from Melton, has a lifelong passion for classic cars and in recent years has amassed a collection of vintage Bentleys and Rolls Royces - the first of which he bought aged 20. However, his latest purchase is very different - a Sinclair C5.\n\nThe famed electric pedal cycle is an icon of the 80s in more ways than one, mostly for its failure, but Cormac couldn’t resist adding it to his collection and hasn’t stopped whizzing around in it ever since. The eccentric told LeicestershireLive: “I’ve had Rollers and Bentleys since I was 20, but I’ve always been drawn to those things with a bit of character, history and charm about them. Yes it was a failure but it’s an iconic thing.”\n\nREAD MORE: Parents bid to find Loughborough families after fatal 1986 crash\n\nREAD MORE: 'We are not corrupt' says council after 'shocking' planning decision\n\nDesigned by Sir Clive Sinclair, the C5 was billed as the way forward in personal transportation when it launched in January 1985. Sir Clive made his name in computing, but always looked at producing electric vehicles, with the C5 his beloved creation.\n\nHowever, the three-wheeler, which was road-legal and boasted a chassis made by Lotus, was an unmitigated disaster. The short battery range of the C5 alongside lack of power as it had just 0.34 horsepower were among its many faults.\n\nNo roof to protect its occupants from the very British weather conditions was also a major mistake that counted against it. A top speed of just 15mph didn’t help either as sales were poor from day one.\n\nProduction ceased in August 1985, but in the decades since the Sinclair C5 has gained a cult following. Snazzily-dressed Cormac, 24, immediately connected with the C5 and believes they share something special - quirkiness.\n\nHe said: “There’s something uniquely British about it. It failed, but it’s very charming and I couldn’t resist when a friend made me the offer to buy it.-\n\n\"It’s probably the vehicle that best suits me and my dress sense - unique, a one-off and individual. People of a certain age will know all about it and those who don’t can look at it and wonder how it even works and is road legal. I’ve got no end of funny looks already, but I just take it in my stride.”\n\nThe pristine condition C5 runs like a dream for Cormac who likes to take it out on as many journeys as possible. While the battery life may be short, he is making the most of the unique creation and isn’t trying to compare it to his other classic collectibles.\n\nHowever, one key difference between the C5 and his vintage four-wheelers is storage space and it’s something Cormac is already having to make adjustments for.\n\nHe said: “It’s not the biggest boot in the world. You could just about fit one small shopping bag in there. It’s definitely not the thing to take for the big shop at Lidl.”\n\nThe C5 is the newest addition to the car enthusiasts' collection, but the budding Jeremy Clarkson, who posts car reviews to his own YouTube channel, Cormac on Cars, still has eyes on much bigger - and faster - vehicles.\n\nHe said: “I’m still aiming to get my Bugatti Veyron and Lamborghini Aventador, but when this offer came up I couldn’t resist. I love it, it’s so much fun. It’s a British failure, but such a classic.”"
