Several small factories producing wood products, including coffins, furniture, grain cradles, and building materials, were operated by the Shutt families for several decades.” George made grain cradles and other wooden products in a shop near his house that may still be standing (it was in 1986, when the book was written). His brothers Jacob and John were prominent local woodworkers as well.\n\nCounty records give little information on the log cabin, only that it is 36 feet by 16 feet (576 square feet).\n\n131double\n\n131 Double Creek Road, Surry County\n\nCopeland Baptist Church\n\n$225,000 (originally $274,500)\n\n1 bedroom, 1 1/2 bathrooms, 2,520 square feet, 0.89 “pesticide free” acre\n\nPrice/square foot: $89\n\nBuilt in 1896\n\nListed May 23, 2024\n\nLast sale: $80,000, July 2004\n\nNeighborhood: The property has a Dobson mailing address but is in southern Surry County, about 8 1/2 miles southeast of Dobson.\n\nNote: The building housed the Copeland Baptist Church from 1896-1957.\n\nA 1996 pamphlet (last photo above) shows the building as two-and-a-half stories with a steeple (Surry County Digital Heritage).\n\nThe exterior picture included in the listing (above) is an undated photo from the Surry County Digital Heritage website.

There are 7 unregistered historic structures built as residential homes on 1.28-acre parcel on East Center St. excluding left and right block corners. These structures are vacant, in need of extensive repairs and renovations with possible Lexington grant funds for rehabilitation. Main structure facing Center Street of 4,952 SF [5,004 per county] is ideal for corporate office and great value with development of remaining acres.”\n\nThe listing says the property is on the highest point in Lexington.\n\nThe Eanes House is in its original location. Also on the site are “a wing of the former Hargrave-Craven house that was removed from the house and remodeled as an office on this site. The … office and six other buildings were moved to the seven acre parcel ca. 1980 as part of a commercial and office development known as the Oak Grove Restoration. In addition to the office, the relocated buildings include the Fredonia School, a Triple A mill house, a mid-twentieth century barn, the nineteenth century Hargrave-Craven house and its detached kitchen, and a log corncrib.” (N.C. Department of Transportation survey, 2000)\n\nThomas Shell Eanes (1874-1971) owned coal and ice companies in Lexington and Thomasville and was founder and president of the Davidson County Creamery Company. He also served as a Lexington city commissioner and as president of the N.C. Ice Association. A grandson sold the property in 1980.\n\nCounty records date the house to 1925, but the Eanes family was listed at the address as early as 1916. A News & Record article in 1990 gave 1880 as the date. The piece detailed the efforts of multiple owners to establish the property as a commercial center as far back as 1980.\n\nCounty property record card: “ALL BUILDINGS DILAPIDATED … VACANT FORMERLY KATHERINES REST & CHEESE SHOP … BAILEY HOUSE INN”\n\nClick here for a marketing brochure.

There’s also what appears to be a modern house on the property, which isn’t mentioned in the listing’s description. The sale of the property in 2020 included the Merry Oaks rail depot, which also isn’t mentioned in this current listing but may still be there.\n\nMerry Oaks was once a thriving railroad community, but it was left behind by the decline of the railroad and the relocation of U.S. 1 just a bit to the north. The News & Observer told the story in 2020, when the property was last sold (click here if the online link doesn’t work).\n\nThe property was bought in 2020 by a couple from Raleigh, who don’t appear to have invested much into it.\n\nSomething to ask about: The property is near the site where electric-car maker VinFast is planning a massive, $4 billion factory (if it doesn’t go bankrupt first). The nearby Merry Oaks Baptist Church is threatened by highway plans related to the project (here and here), as are several homes and businesses. This property doesn’t appear to be among them, but it would be good to hear someone say that.
