They are used to manufacture automotive catalysts, jewelry, medical products, and chemical products.\n\nAccording to the PGM market report, global demand reached 570.6 t in 2023, but only 71% was provided by primary supply. United States Geological Survey showed that of the 71,000 t of PGM natural reserves last year, 89% corresponds to production in South Africa, 8% to Russia, and the USA only 1.2%. The production chain of PGM includes Mining, concentration, smelting, and refining, with froth flotation as the main concentration process. In the flotation process, many factors can be considered. One of them is the particle size since excessive grinding can imply loss in the slimes. On the other hand, coarse material would not represent enough liberation of values. In this sense, it is necessary to study this parameter to reach maximum recovery. Matthew Mettler, Colorado School of Mines\n\nPGM Extraction from Lundin Eagle Mine Tailings\n\nThe Lundin Eagle Mine in Michigan is considering reprocessing their tailings to recover more nickel, cobalt and platinum group metals (PGMs). These metals are mostly found in solid solution with pyrrhotite: a non-stoichiometric iron sulfide that has been historically sent to the tailings. This is due to the difficulty in flotation separation resulting from the iron hydroxide surface layer, and the production of sulfur dioxide during roasting. Several different flotation pathways are under consideration to improve recovery and separation of pyrrhotite and the PGMs, such as the addition of copper sulfate, varying the pH and aeration rate, sample pretreatment with sulfuric acid, and the use of nitrogen instead of air. After flotation, the concentrate will be processed through a roaster, reduction kiln, and magnetic separator to separate and recover the different metals. The PGMs are expected to follow the nickel through the process and be separated during magnetic separation. Samples from the Eagle Mine are being processed and will be characterized by the end of the month using ICP, XRF, XRD and automated mineralogy. This will reveal the particle size distribution and elemental composition of the tailings, as well as the extent of pyrrhotite oxidation. Carl Gorski, Colorado School of Mines\n\nExploiting Rare Earth Element Mineralization Via Preferential Breakage And Sortation: The Bear Lodge Project\n\nThe Bear Lodge project is a prospect in Wyoming’s Black Hills that hosts one of the largest rare earth element (REE) resources in the United States (USGS, 1983). The purpose of this study is to examine how physical properties within Bear Lodge’s oxidized carbonatite may be exploited to reduce energy/water consumption during comminution. When hypogene carbonatite is subject to heavy supergene oxidation, the iron sulfides within produce a significant amount of sulfuric acid. This strong acid eats away at the silica-undersaturated, carbonate-enriched host rock, depleting the carbonatite of its main constituent, carbonate. The result is an extensive FeOx-MnOx-REE (FMR) alteration throughout the deposit’s oxidized zone. Mineralization of REEs in these FMR zones is incredibly fine-grained, controlled by vein or stockwork systems (planar features), and lacks competency. Combined, these characteristics may allow for easy separation of RE minerals when the ore is crushed in a manner that exploits these incompetent, fine-grained veins/stockwork/planes of weakness. To test this theory, the oxidized ore will be crushed using a high-pressure grinding roll, with preferential breakage reducing the overall energy needed during secondary crushing. During this process, frequent particle size distribution and detailed mineralogical analyses of the ore will be used to track process efficiency. The feasibility of a soration process before crushing is also to be explored. Current sortation techniques may include XRT (sortation by density), Radiometric (sortation by radioactivity), Reflected light (sortation by reflectivity), etc. If successful, the sortation of ore before comminution may reduce the mill feed by at least 20 wt%, and increase the REE head grade by 10%. Removing material from entering the secondary/tertiary mill circuit will also decrease energy requirements and limit water consumption, lowering the project's overall environmental impact and increasing its economic viability.

These minerals are crucial to renewable energy technologies. As such, there is an urgent need to develop multi-disciplinary, techno-economic workflows for critical mineral recovery from unconventional sources such as tailings. To work towards these goals, I am conducting a case study of placer tailings in Flat, Alaska to determine the viability of reprocessing the tailings and extracting critical elements. The town of Flat is a historic gold mine in the Kuskokwim Mountains consisting of fluvial placer deposits on creeks that drain multiple sources of mineralization. The tailings present potential critical element contents of tungsten, arsenic, and chromium, as well as other elements associated with or occurring within the structure of various mineral phases. The first stage of this project involves mineral processing and analytical techniques to define a workflow for processing tailings and determining their contents. Gravity concentration methods were selected; a shaking table was utilized for the -12 US mesh material, while a jig was used for the +12 mesh fraction. Early results suggest the effectiveness of our methods on -30 mesh material, resulting in the concentration of minerals into heavy, middling, and light fractions. Critical mineral recovery from mine tailings has the potential to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals, the reduction of mining waste, and the mitigation of environmental hazards associated with tailings. Nicholas Sinclair, Case Western University\n\nA Continuous and Sustainable Process for Rare-Earth Electrowinning Via Chloride Based Molten-Salt Electrolysis\n\nRare earth metal demand is sharply rising due to both green and consumer technologies, but U.S accessibility remains sparse resulting from an unsecured domestic supply chain. 1,2 Though ~15% of global REO is mined domestically,upstream processing remains rare in the U.S due to the environmental impact. The current practice for neodymium processing uses a neodymium/lithium/calcium fluoride melt with a consumable carbon anode converting dissolved neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) and carbon to neodymium metal and CO2.1,3 Hazardous perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are also generated as anode gases and, when combined with emission of a significant amount of greenhouse gasses (CO, CO2), this makes the current neodymium electrowinning process dangerous and environmentally unsustainable.An alternative, lower temperature molten salt electrolysis process has been demonstrated with high efficiency, low specific energy consumption and high purity as-won metal utilizing chloride salts consisting of lithium chloride (LiCl), potassium chloride (KCl), and neodymium chloride (NdCl3).4,5,6 The process is enabled by a non-consumable, catalytic anode which both improves electrochemical stability and reduces energy consumption. Building on this, our work now focuses on producing metal continuously to enable higher throughput, and reduce energy consumption leading to an economically viable, environmentally friendly alternative to the oxyfluoride process. This talk focuses on recent advancements in producing neodymium in a continuous manner while not sacrificing for key metrics like efficiency and purity. Further, we report direct liquid metal deposition of a 90:10 (wt %) alloy which can enable continuous metal collection. Jeremy Seidel, Lawrence Livermore National Lab\n\nHerero-ion complexation in the lanthanide-binding protein lanmodulin\n\nThe purification of rare earth elements from complex feedstocks has proven to be a vexing industrial challenge, traditionally requiring hundreds of stages of mixer-separators for solvent extraction. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of immobilized lanmodulin for the tandem extraction and separation of REEs, including the successful separation of Nd and Dy. In order to fully realize the potential of lanmodulin to separate adjacent REEs, we are developing a predictive model for the lanmodulin column. We have shown that the adsorption isotherm for binary mixtures of REEs fits a cooperative model of metal chelation in which lanmodulin binds two ions simultaneously, and that binding of both homogeneous and heterogeneous ion pairs is essential to describe the adsorption isotherm. To extend these thermodynamic models to the flow-through column we created a first-principles model to account for mass transfer and kinetics. This column model demonstrated that a gradient of ions formed during REE adsorption, with stronger binding metals accumulating near the inlet and weaker binding metals accumulating near the outlet. Ongoing work aims to extend the model to account for pH effects and accurately model the kinetics of metal desorption with chemical chelators. Yating Yuan, Oak Ridge National Lab\n\nMechanistic Insight Into Electrochemical Graphitization\n\nThe electrochemical graphitization of various carbonaceous precursors in molten salts has proven to be an energy-efficient and economically competitive process. ( a few references) Despite its advantages, the mechanism behind this electrochemically driven process remains unknown. In this study, we investigate the different stages of the graphitization process using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis , Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurement, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging. Our observations reveal that graphitization initiates at the interface of carbon and molten salts, propagating into the bulk phase thereafter. This discovery provides valuable insight into understanding the electrochemical graphitization process, inspiring the synthesis of various graphitized porous carbons with different surface areas. These materials exhibit enhanced conductivity without compromising supercapacitor performance. Erandika Karunaratne, Ames National Lab\n\nDetermination of Metal-Ligand Binding Strength using IR Spectroscopy\n\nThe determination of metal-ligand stability constants, represented as log K values, is a critical aspect in the process of metal separation and purification. Experimental determination of these values is a laborious task, making high-throughput screening difficult without a predictive model. Although ab-initio calculations are typically used in predicting these values, the associated computational cost render them impractical. As a result, data-driven machine-learning (ML) models have been developed and show great promise for estimating metal-ligand log K values. However, currently available ML models do not explicitly capture the effect of matrix such as solvent effect. To address this limitation herein we show the capability of using Infrared (IR) spectra-based models to capture the metal-ligand binding strength qualitatively and quantitatively. IR spectroscopy is a fast, accurate, and nondestructive method that can be coupled with high-throughput workflows. In this study, qualitative binding strengths were captured using Principal Component Analysis while quantitative determination of log K was done using multi-variate regression and different ML techniques. Haeyeon Kim, Idaho National Lab\n\nImpact of CMI technologies on the platinum group metal supply chain\n\nIn this project, we develop a system dynamics model to quantify the impacts of CMI technologies on platinum group metals (PGM) supply chain. The presentation will provide an overview of the analytical framework and global PGM production. PGM refers to platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium. Production module considers PGM production as the main product or a byproduct of base metals. Platinum is mostly (80%) produced as the main product from southern African PGM mining (South Africa and Zimbabwe). Palladium is produced as byproduct of base metal mining in Russia (40% of global production), the main product from southern Africa (40%), and the remainder from North America. Minor PGMs (rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium) are extracted as byproducts from platinum mining in Southern Africa. Two CMI technologies are being considered for supply impacts on the PGM supply chain, including: a) enhanced extraction of PGM from primary sources and; b) selective separation of PGMs from selenium crude from copper concentrator."
