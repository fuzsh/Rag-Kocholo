        "text": "It’s time for a change: time for everyone to plug in and take part in a new movement. The Volkswagen ID range is the new face of electric mobility that’s going to shake up the way we drive. Family, electric mobility becomes accessible for everyone.\n\nOffering an incredible driving range of up to 342 miles from one charge The ID is designed to make driving fun again at the price point of a comparable car with a combustion engine – because no game-changing idea is for the better, unless everyone can become a part of it.\n\nThe ID CROZZ\n\nThe prototype ID. Crozz is Volkswagen’s glimpse into the future of driving. Packed with innovation, this car keeps you gliding across the road in comfort and style. You can even use voice commands to ensure all your needs are met, no matter how small. In the near future, the ID. Crozz will be able to drive autonomously so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the view. Say hello to total freedom.\n\nRange: travel up to 500 km on a single charge\n\nThe ID BUZZ\n\nThis autonomous electric van brings our iconic Volkswagen camper van into the new era and reinjects it with some class leading new technology. As a concept vehicle, you'll still have to wait a while before you see it in our Sinclair Volkswagen Showrooms but we guarantee It will be worth the wait.\n\nThe ID VIZZION\n\nThe ID. Vizzion combines luxury with sustainability. As you approach the vehicle, the facial recognition system sees you and opens the doors. At the same time, the LED light strips around the car greet you by gently pulsing. The generous space within allows you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the Autonomous ride. And for privacy, the side windows and panoramic glass roof can be tinted"
