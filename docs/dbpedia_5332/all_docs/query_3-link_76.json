        "text": "All car manufacturers are looking to the future. The petrol based cars are on the way out; the electric cars are on the way in. This is what we see with the arrival of the Skoda Enyaq iV., which is the Czech company’s first true foray into the electric car world. There’s much to be excited about when it comes to this vehicle, which is boasting some impressive numbers. For instance, it’ll take you around 260 miles on a single charge, or at least that’s according to the manufacturer. As technology improves, the range that electric vehicles can travel is becoming further and further.\n\nIt’s not just the electric aspect that’ll appeal to drivers, however. There’s also the interior aspect, too. The infotainment system is especially impressive. There’s a 13-inch infotainment display, which is the largest in the range. The boot capacity, at 585 litres, also offers plenty of space. The SUV was designed to meet “modern living arrangements,” which means that the manufacturer has gone to great lengths to preserve the interior spaciousness. Under the hood offers power, there’s space in the boot, and you’ll have a roomy environment in the front too.\n\nTo show just how forward-thinking Skoda were when they were designing this vehicle, they’ve included an augmented reality display up front. The future is something that Skoda are very much committed to; this vehicle is just the first of their plan to launch around ten electric vehicles by 2023.\n\nThere’ll be a range of different trims and levels available when it comes to the Skoda Enyaq iV. You’ll be able to select between front and rear drive, a range of different battery sizes, and five different power outputs. If you’re looking to get the most powerful model, then you’ll have a 125kW unit that can hit up to 310 miles.\n\nEssentially, when it came to this vehicle, Skoda were looking to blend the company’s traditional values with the future. So all the features of Skoda vehicles that we all know and love -- such as generous space both in the seats and in the boots and strong design elements -- are present, yet there’s also an eye on the future. This is an environmentally friendly vehicle that pushes the game forward, yet it’s still a fun and enjoyable driving experience. The name itself shows just what Skoda had in mind during the development of the car: Enyaq is a riff on ‘Enya’ which means source of life. This is a car that’ll help families and business people go about their business, secure in the knowledge that they’re driving an environmentally friendly vehicle.\n\nWhen can we expect the car to be on sale, and on the roads? Probably some time in early 2021. If you’re in the market for a Skoda vehicle, then be sure to check out the collection on offer here at Sinclair Skoda. We are the official Skoda dealer of South Wales, and also provide other Skoda-related services, such as providing used Skodas and MOT testing."
