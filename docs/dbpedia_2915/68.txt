Service Around the World

Welcome to Social Securityâ€™s Office of Earnings & International Operations (OEIO) home page. The purpose of this site is to assist our customers who live outside the United States or plan to leave the country.

OEIO manages the Social Security program outside the U.S. and implements the benefit provisions of international agreements. There are no Social Security offices outside the U.S., so OEIO receives assistance from the Department of State's embassies and consulates around the world.

Foreign Countries Served by Social Security

If you live outside of the United States, there are American embassies and consulates with trained personnel to assist you in seeking Social Security services (Canadian residents are served by domestic Social Security border offices). You can access information to contact our Social Security and consular staff by locating your country in the link below:

Notice Regarding Forms SSA-7161 and SSA-7162

In most countries, the postal service disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have been resolved. We resumed mailing the "Report To The United States Social Security Administration, " forms ( Form SSA-7161 and Form SSA-7162 ) in late June 2022. Forms will be mailed according to the schedule that was in effect prior to the pandemic (i.e. if you were expecting a form in 2020, you will receive it in 2022; 2021 in 2023). Please complete and return the forms promptly to avoid suspension of benefits.
