Certain provisions of District of Columbia law may be less restrictive than federal law, and employers covered by the FLSA that only follow a less restrictive provision of District of Columbia law will be in violation of federal law. See 29 U.S.C. 218(a). For more information on federal child labor law, please visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division Website at www.dol.gov/whd.\n\nMinimum Wage\n\nBeginning July 1, 2024, the minimum wage in the District of Columbia will increase from $17.00 per hour to $17.50 per hour for all workers, regardless of the size of the employer.\n\nAs of July 1, 2024, the base minimum wage for tipped employees will increase from $8.00 per hour to $10.00. However, if an employee’s hourly tip earnings (averaged weekly) added to the base minimum wage do not equal the District’s full minimum wage, the employer must pay the difference.\n\nMinimum Wage Amendment Revision Act Poster – (English/Spanish/Chinese/Amharic)\n\nNeed to file a claim?
