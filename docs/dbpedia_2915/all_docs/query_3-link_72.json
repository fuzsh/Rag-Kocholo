        "text": "What is a living wage?\n\nRemuneration received for a standard work week by a worker in a particular [time and] place sufficient to afford a decent standard of living include food, water, housing, education, healthcare, transport, clothing and other essential needs including provision for unexpected events.\n\nLearn more\n\nHow is it calculated?\n\nThe Global Living Wage Coalition supports the use of the Anker Methodology for estimating living wages globally. This methodology, developed by renowned living wage experts Richard Anker and Martha Anker uses a combination of primary and secondary data to create highly accurate, robust living wage estimates that are transparent, internationally comparable, and locally specific.\n\nLearn more\n\nWhat Makes our Methodology Unique?\n\nThis manual, authored by Richard Anker and Martha Anker, describes a new methodology to measure the decent but basic standard of living in different countries, and how much workers need to earn to support themselves and their families. This information allows researchers to estimate comparable living wages around the world and determine gaps between living wages and prevailing wages, even in countries with limited secondary data.\n\nLearn More\n\nLiving wage is based on cost of living in a specific geography. Therefore, living wage benchmarks are applicable to all workers regardless of sector, industry, or job type. At the same time, many geographies are dominated by a few sectors, and some sector platforms have developed significant living wage activities which cut across several different geographies or countries. The Global Living Wage Coalition members are also engaged more actively with certain sectors. As such, most living wage benchmark reports reference sectors which either dominate the landscape or were instrumental in realizing completion of the study.\n\nThe Global Living Wage Coalition offers content by industry for easy reference on all living wage benchmarks, case studies, and other resources that are available in geographies that are important to that sector.\n\nLiving wage is based on cost of living in a specific geography. Often times, the geographic scope is at a sub-country level, and typically there are differences between rural and urban or peri-urban areas. As such, there can easily be more than one living wage benchmark per country.\n\nThe Global Living Wage Coalition offers content organized by country for quick access to the relevant living wage benchmarks, case studies, and related resources which may be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders."
