        "text": "The United States measures poverty based on how an individual’s or family’s income compares to a set federal threshold.1 For example, in the 2021 definition, people are considered impoverished if their individual income is below $12,880 or their household income is below $26,500 for a family of 4.2 After 5 consecutive years in decline, the U.S. poverty rate increased to 11.4 percent in 2020, or a total of 37.2 million people.3\n\nPoverty often occurs in concentrated areas and endures for long periods of time.1 Some communities, such as certain racial and ethnic groups, people living in rural areas, and people with disabilities, have a higher risk of poverty for a myriad of factors that extend beyond individual control.1,4–8 For example, institutional racism and discrimination contribute to unequal social and economic opportunities.4 Residents of impoverished communities often have reduced access to resources that are needed to support a healthy quality of life, such as stable housing, healthy foods, and safe neighborhoods.1,4,9 Poverty can also limit access to educational and employment opportunities, which further contributes to income inequality and perpetuates cyclical effects of poverty.1\n\nUnmet social needs, environmental factors, and barriers to accessing health care contribute to worse health outcomes for people with lower incomes.10,11 For example, people with limited finances may have more difficulty obtaining health insurance or paying for expensive procedures and medications.12 In addition, neighborhood factors, such as limited access to healthy foods and higher instances of violence, can affect health by influencing health behaviors and stress.12\n\nAcross the lifespan, residents of impoverished communities are at increased risk for mental illness, chronic disease, higher mortality, and lower life expectancy.9,13–17 Children make up the largest age group of those experiencing poverty.18,19 Childhood poverty is associated with developmental delays, toxic stress, chronic illness, and nutritional deficits.20–24 Individuals who experience childhood poverty are more likely to experience poverty into adulthood, which contributes to generational cycles of poverty.25 In addition to lasting effects of childhood poverty, adults living in poverty are at a higher risk of adverse health effects from obesity, smoking, substance use, and chronic stress.12 Finally, older adults with lower incomes experience higher rates of disability and mortality.6 One study found that men and women in the top 1 percent of income were expected to live 14.6 and 10.1 years longer respectively than men and women in the bottom 1 percent.26"
