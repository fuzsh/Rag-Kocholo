        "text": "North America has been divided into:\n\n15 broad, level I ecological regions;\n\n50 level II ecological regions intended to provide a more detailed description of the large ecological areas nested within the level I regions; and\n\n182 Level III ecoregions, which are smaller ecological areas nested within level II regions.\n\nSelect a link for additional details about each level, or a list of links to downloadable maps and GIS data files.\n\nLevel I Ecoregions\n\nNorth America has been divided into 15 broad, level I ecological regions. These highlight major ecological areas and provide the broad backdrop to the ecological mosaic of the continent, putting it in context at global or intercontinental scales.\n\nViewing the ecological hierarchy at this scale provides a context for seeing global or intercontinental patterns. Level I ecological regions are: Arctic Cordillera, Tundra, Taiga, Hudson Plains, Northern Forests, Northwestern Forested Mountains, Marine West Coast Forests, Eastern Temperate Forests, Great Plains, North American Deserts, Mediterranean California, Southern Semi-Arid Highlands, Temperate Sierras, Tropical Dry Forests and Tropical Wet Forests.\n\nLevel II Ecoregions\n\nThe 50 level II ecological regions that have been delineated are intended to provide a more detailed description of the large ecological areas nested within the level I regions. Level II ecological regions are useful for national and subcontinental overviews of ecological patterns.\n\nLevel III Ecoregions\n\nLevel III mapping describes smaller ecological areas nested within level II regions. At level III, the continent currently contains 182 ecological regions. These smaller divisions enhance regional environmental monitoring, assessment and reporting, as well as decision-making. Because level III regions are smaller, they allow locally defining characteristics to be identified, and more specifically oriented management strategies to be formulated (CEC 1997).\n\nDownloads\n\nMaps (PDF format):\n\nLevel I Ecoregions of North America: Full size map (PDF, 6 mb)\n\nLevel II Ecoregions of North America: Full size map (PDF, 10 mb)\n\nLevel III Ecoregions of North America: Full size map (PDF, 9 mb)\n\nGIS data (shapefiles, metadata and symbology).
