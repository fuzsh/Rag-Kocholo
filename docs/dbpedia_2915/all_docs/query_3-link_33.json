        "text": "Am I eligible for rural health funding?\n\nPeople who live in areas that we define as rural are eligible to benefit from our programs. Use the Rural Health Grants Eligibility Analyzer.\n\nHow do you define rural?\n\nThe United States Census Bureau (Census) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) define rural areas. We use these definitions and Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes to create our own definition.\n\nHow does the Census define “rural”?\n\nThe Census does not define “rural.” They consider “rural” to include all people, housing, and territory that are not within an urban area. Any area that is not urban is rural.\n\nThe Census defines urban as:\n\nUrbanized Areas (UAs) of 50,000 or more people\n\nUrban Clusters (UCs) of 2,500 - 49,999 people\n\nAfter the 2010 Census, they classified 19.3% of the population (59.5 million people) and 97% of the land area as rural.\n\nHow does OMB define rural?\n\nOMB decides which counties are metropolitan (metro), micropolitan (micro), or neither.\n\nArea or CountyRural or Not RuralMetro area (urban core of 50,000 or more people)Not ruralMicro area (urban core of 10,000-49,999 people)RuralCounties outside of Metro or Micro AreasRural\n\nAfter the 2010 Census, the non-metro counties contained 46.2 million people, about 15% of the population and covered 72% of the land area of the country.\n\nWhat challenges do the two definitions present?\n\nThe Census and OMB definitions present measurement challenges.\n\nThe Census overcounts the number of people in rural areas, while the OMB undercounts them.\n\nThe Census definition:\n\nDoes not follow city or county boundaries, making it hard to determine if an area is urban or rural\n\nClassifies many suburban areas as rural\n\nThe OMB includes some rural areas in metropolitan counties.\n\nExample: The Grand Canyon is in a metro county.\n\nHow do we overcome these challenges?\n\nWe use Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)’s Economic Research Service (ERS) creates these codes using U.S. Census data.\n\nHow many census tracts are there in the U.S.?\n\nThere are more than 70,000 tracts in the U.S.\n\nIs it possible to identify rural tracts in metro counties?\n\nWe can identify rural census tracts in metro counties. Each census tract aligns with assigned RUCA codes.\n\nWe consider tracts inside metro counties with the codes 4-10 as rural.\n\nDo RUCA codes work for larger tracts?\n\nIn larger tracts, you cannot use RUCA codes alone. The codes do not factor in distance to services and low numbers of people.\n\nIn response, we classified 132 large area census tracts with RUCA codes 2 or 3 as rural. These tracts are at least 400 square miles in area with no more than 35 people per square mile.\n\nHow can I find a complete list of rural areas?\n\nDownload our Data Files for lists of rural areas by county, census tract, and ZIP code.\n\nHow Do We Define Rural?\n\nWe define the following areas as rural:\n\nAll non-metro counties\n\nAll metro census tracts with RUCA codes 4-10 and\n\nLarge area Metro census tracts of at least 400 sq. miles in area with population density of 35 or less per sq. mile with RUCA codes 2-3.\n\nBeginning with Fiscal Year 2022 Rural Health Grants, we consider all outlying metro counties without a UA to be rural.\n\nFor more detail on the addition of outlying metro counties, read the Federal Register Notice, Revised Geographic Eligibility for Federal Office of Rural Health Policy Grants. This change will go into effect in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022.\n\nBased on 2010 Census data, 19.7% of the population (60.8 million people) and 86% of the land area of the country are considered rural.\n\nWhat is the change?\n\nWe changed how we define rural. We updated the list of areas eligible for rural health funding.\n\nDid you remove any areas?\n\nNo, we did not remove any areas. We expanded. Starting in FY 2022, we’ll consider all outlying metro counties without a UA to be rural.\n\nHow does this affect me?\n\nIt may allow your geographic area to apply for, or receive services from, our rural health grants."
