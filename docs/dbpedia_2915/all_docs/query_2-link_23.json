        "text": "This analysis excludes 2020-2021. Data for 2021 is a significant undercount due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Alliance includes renter households living below the national poverty level in its analysis – the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s analysis focuses on renter households making 30 percent or less of the area median income.\n\nThese numbers are from the HUD PIT count. However, the Alliance drew its analysis of why and how these reductions took place are from news outlets and independent sources.\n\nKey Facts\n\nThe current edition of this report analyzes available data on homelessness for 2023 and over time. Key facts and data points include:\n\nResponse Systems Work Effectively. The homeless response system continues to add more temporary and permanent beds each year. It increasingly serves more people, but needs more resources to combat the nationwide affordable housing crisis.\n\nRecord-High Homeless Counts. A record-high 653,104 people experienced homelessness on a single night in January 2023. This is more than a 12.1 percent increase over the previous year.\n\nRecord High Numbers of People Living Unsheltered, Especially Among Individuals. In 2023, a record high 256,610 people, or 39.3 percent of all people experiencing homelessness, were unsheltered. More than 50 percent of individuals experiencing homelessness were unsheltered.\n\nSevere Housing Cost Burden on the Rise. The number of renter households paying more than 50 percent of their income on rent increased dramatically, rising over 12.6 percent between 2015 to 2022. People who identify as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, Asian or ‘Some Other Race’ are more greatly impacted.\n\nBackward Movement. After years of declines due to targeted assistance, the numbers of veterans and chronically homeless individuals experiencing homelessness are both rising again, with a 7 percent and 12 percent increase, respectively, since the previous year.\n\nThe Homelessness Response System is Helping More People Sleep Inside, But It Can’t Keep Up with Demand\n\nIn 2023, the homelessness response system worked diligently to reduce homelessness. Evidence of its effectiveness includes:\n\nMore People Served in Shelters. Between 2022 and 2023, there was a 14 percent increase in the number of people staying in shelters on the night of the Point-in-Time Count (PIT Count).\n\nPermanent Housing Supply Expanded. The homelessness response system added 36,737 Permanent Support Housing (PSH), Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) and Other Permanent Housing (OPH) units between 2022 and 2023.\n\nMore People Exiting to Permanent Housing. The number of people who exited temporary housing, PSH, OPH or RRH to permanent, independent housing increased from 302,006 people in 2022 to 317,994 people in 2023. Still, too many people are entering into homelessness for the system to keep up, too many people are living in doubled up housing due to financial necessity, and exits to permanent housing have not returned to pre-pandemic numbers.\n\nUnsheltered Homelessness Grew Slower than Sheltered Homelessness. Between 2022 and 2023, unsheltered homelessness increased by 9.7 percent but was outpaced by a 13.7 percent increase in sheltered homelessness. The number of people accessing services is increasing faster than the number of people being forced to live outside.\n\nFewer Returns to Homelessness. Fewer returns to homelessness in 2023 compared to 2019 suggest that frontline workers are connecting people with safe, stable housing and higher incomes.\n\nUnfortunately, the hard work and limited resources of the homeless response system is not enough to overcome the powerful factors that push people into homelessness. This section will discuss the increasing number of people entering homelessness for the first time, the shortage of needed beds, and the need to address unsheltered homelessness.\n\nWhy Do People Experience Homelessness?\n\nA nationwide shortage of deeply affordable housing drives homelessness. The National Low Income Housing Coalition found that just 34 affordable units were available for every 100 renters making less than 30 percent of their area’s median income. As a result, 74 percent of extremely low-income renters pay more than 50 percent of their income on rent.3\n\nRental burdens in 2023 were extremely high. This is not a new problem, but the result of decades of inadequate investments in housing that caused rent burdens to steadily increase since the 1970s. To reverse this long-term trend and end homelessness, policymakers must make significant investments to ensure that all people have deeply affordable and safe housing. Some people also need additional income, health care, and social supports that are too expensive or inaccessible on the private market.\n\nFor far too many Americans, rents are too high, while incomes are too low.\n\nEven for people in the labor force, incomes are not keeping pace with rising housing, health care and living costs. When incomes do not keep pace with housing costs, more people struggle to remain housed. When this happens, communities suffer and become less productive.\n\nBy greatly expanding the supply of deeply affordable housing – through preserving existing affordable units and building new ones – the United States can make rent less expensive for low-income households. Policymakers can also ensure that people have access to income support when they still cannot afford housing. Crucially, once they are in stable housing, some people may also need access to mental and physical health care as well as substance use treatment. Policymakers should appropriately fund these supportive services.\n\nResearch suggests that increasing the availability of affordable permanent housing while ensuring income support for those who need it is the only way to prevent homelessness.\n\nOn the Brink\n\nHomelessness should be prevented before it happens, reducing hardships for those impacted and reducing the demand for homeless services. But who is at risk of homelessness? The most relevant groups include households that are a) severely housing cost-burdened or b) doubled up. Policies to support these groups can help everyone access stable housing.\n\nWhere Do People Experience Homelessness?\n\nIn efforts to understand and end homelessness, location matters in various ways, including:\n\nWho Experiences Homelessness?\n\nThe nationwide Point-in-Time Count offers the following facts about people experiencing homelessness:\n\n71.5 percent, the vast majority of people experiencing homelessness, are individual adults.\n\n51.2 percent of these individuals experienced unsheltered homelessness.\n\n28.5 percent are people living in families with children.\n\nTo better identify and address disparities, this section will delve deeper into other subpopulations within homelessness.\n\nThe United States Can Connect Everyone with a Safe Place to Sleep\n\nUnfortunately, misperceptions about ending homelessness are common. They frequently ignore the root causes and lead policymakers to divert resources from proven interventions. For example, criminalizing homelessness and restricting people from accessing shelters are not solutions. Both are costly and make it more difficult for people to live independently.\n\nInstead, the nation can and should learn from examples that actually work."
