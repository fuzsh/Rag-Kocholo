Look up the country on the SSA Payments Abroad Screening Tool to be sure you can receive your payments.\n\nUse work credits from another country to qualify for Social Security\n\nIf you worked outside the U.S., you may not have enough Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security retirement or disability benefits. But you may be able to count your work credits from another country.\n\nSee if the country you have worked in has a retirement benefit agreement with the United States.\n\nApply for and manage your Social Security benefits from outside the U.S.\n\nIf you live outside the U.S., you can apply for Social Security benefits online.\n\nSSA pays Social Security benefits electronically through direct deposit. You can set up direct deposit through a financial institution in the U.S. or any country which has an international direct deposit agreement with the U.S. Get a list of countries and territories that allow direct deposit payments.\n\nOnce you begin receiving Social Security benefits abroad, SSA will send you a questionnaire every 1 to 2 years. This questionnaire will determine if you are still eligible for benefits. If you do not respond, SSA may stop your benefit payments. Learn more about these questionnaires on page 21 of SSAâs publication Your Payments While You Are Outside the United States [PDF, 317KB].\n\nGet help with your Social Security benefits while you are outside the U.S."
