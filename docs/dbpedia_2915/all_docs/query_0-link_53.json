        "text": "Learn About Water Quality With Karen Bohnsack, Marine Resources Manager at Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary\n\nKaren Bohnsack works with the superintendent and deputy superintendent to support the day-to-day operations of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary including leading Florida International University affiliate staff, supporting science and resource protection efforts, and serving as site lead for water quality and South Florida ecosystem restoration activities. Prior to joining Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, Bohnsack worked with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection where she supported the state's co-management of the sanctuary, oversaw two aquatic preserves, and coordinated coral disease response activities.\n\nDuring the National Marine Sanctuary System's 50th anniversary celebration in 2022, a commemorative poster series was launched to capture the beauty and diversity of each site in the system. The posters are two sided, featuring original artwork on the front and educational information on the back. Other posters created for the system over the years have also been added. Dive in and download your sanctuary posters today!\n\nOur planet is an ocean planet: Earth Is Blue. The National Marine Sanctuary System protects some of the most iconic underwater places throughout the United States, but we can't do it without you. No matter where you are, the ocean and Great Lakes are in your hands. We hope these images inspire you to help care for our ocean and to spread the word that Earth isn't green â it's blue.\n\nSubmit your own photos and join us on:"
