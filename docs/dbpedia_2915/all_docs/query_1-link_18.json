        "text": "The ADA Protects People with Disabilities\n\nA person with a disability is someone who:\n\nhas a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,\n\nhas a history or record of such an impairment (such as cancer that is in remission), or\n\nis perceived by others as having such an impairment (such as a person who has scars from a severe burn).\n\nIf a person falls into any of these categories, the ADA protects them. Because the ADA is a law, and not a benefit program, you do not need to apply for coverage.\n\nWhat does substantially limits mean?\n\nThe term “substantially limits” is interpreted broadly and is not meant to be a demanding standard. But not every condition will meet this standard. An example of a condition that is not substantially limiting is a mild allergy to pollen.\n\nWhat does major life activities mean?\n\nMajor life activities are the kind of activities that you do every day, including your body’s own internal processes. There are many major life activities in addition to the examples listed here. Some examples include:\n\nActions like eating, sleeping, speaking, and breathing\n\nMovements like walking, standing, lifting, and bending\n\nCognitive functions like thinking and concentrating\n\nSensory functions like seeing and hearing\n\nTasks like working, reading, learning, and communicating\n\nThe operation of major bodily functions like circulation, reproduction, and individual organs\n\nExamples of Disabilities\n\nThere is a wide variety of disabilities, and the ADA regulations do not list all of them. Some disabilities are visible and some are not. Some examples of disabilities include:\n\nCancer\n\nDiabetes\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\n\nHIV\n\nAutism\n\nCerebral palsy\n\nDeafness or hearing loss\n\nBlindness or low vision\n\nEpilepsy\n\nMobility disabilities such as those requiring the use of a wheelchair, walker, or cane\n\nIntellectual disabilities\n\nMajor depressive disorder\n\nTraumatic brain injury\n\nThe ADA covers many other disabilities not listed here.\n\nThe ADA Prohibits Disability Discrimination in Many Areas of Life\n\nTo prevent discrimination against people with disabilities, the ADA sets out requirements that apply to many of the situations you encounter in everyday life. Employers, state and local governments, businesses that are open to the public, commercial facilities, transportation providers, and telecommunication companies all have to follow the requirements of the ADA.\n\nThe ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability.\n\nUnder the ADA, it is illegal to discriminate against someone because of their disability.\n\nFor example, a fitness center could not exclude a person who uses a wheelchair from a workout class because they cannot do all of the exercises in the same way.\n\nHowever, a local rec center might only be open to people who live in the surrounding zip code. If the rec center refused access to a person with epilepsy because that person lived in a different zip code, that would not be a violation of the ADA because the rec center would not be discriminating on the basis of the person’s disability.\n\nThe ADA is broken up into five different sections, which are called titles. Different titles set out the requirements for different kinds of organizations. For example, Title I of the ADA covers requirements for employers, and Title II covers requirements for state and local governments. You can find the relevant title of the ADA noted next to each type of organization below.\n\nOther Disability Rights Laws\n\nAlthough the ADA applies to many areas of life, it does not cover everything. In some situations, disability discrimination is prohibited by laws other than the ADA.\n\nWhile the ADA applies to certain types of housing (e.g., housing at private and public universities and public housing programs), the Fair Housing Act applies to many types of housing, both public and privately owned, including housing covered by the ADA.\n\nIf you have a complaint about disability discrimination under the Fair Housing Act: File a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nDisability discrimination during air travel is prohibited by the Air Carriers Access Act.\n\nIf you have a complaint about disability discrimination during air travel: File a complaint with the Department of Transportation’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection.\n\nReligious organizations are exempt from the requirements of Title III of the ADA. For information about how the ADA’s employment obligations apply to religious entities, visit the EEOC’s website. Additionally, religious groups or organizations may still have to comply with state/local building codes or other laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability.\n\nFederal Agencies’ Roles\n\nMany federal agencies are responsible for enforcing the ADA and other laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. These agencies receive complaints, conduct investigations, and issue regulations and guidance to explain the law.\n\nLearn more about these agencies and the laws that they implement:"
