        "meta_description": "Many Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) nations have experienced monumental growth and change in the past several decades, and USAID has partnered with these countries to make important progress. Despite the global financial crisis, the region averaged a three percent annual increase in economic growth between 2000 and 2012. Health indicators have greatly improved in the region: for example, maternal mortality has fallen from 140 to 81 deaths per 100,000 live births since 1990. Political advances have been notable, as well: free elections, vibrant civil society, and responsive governments are mostly the norm.",
