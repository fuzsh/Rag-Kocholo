        "text": "Sustainable Fisheries Division\n\nThe Sustainable Fisheries Division works to maximize fishing opportunities while ensuring the sustainability of fisheries and fishing communities in Alaska. We authorize federal fisheries in Alaska waters annually, and implement fishery management programs developed by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and associated laws. We administer fisheries, collect and manage catch data, and direct a unique Community Development Quota program.\n\nWe also coordinate with the State of Alaska on fishery management and data collection programs, and with the International Pacific Halibut Commission on regulations governing the recreational, commercial, and subsistence Pacific halibut fisheries off Alaska. Our work sustains healthy fish stocks important to commercial and recreational fisheries with the goal of deriving the most benefit from our fisheries for food and economic well-being, while conserving ecosystem health and fish stocks for continued productivity to benefit future generations of fishing families and Alaska’s coastal communities.\n\nProtected Resources Division\n\nThe Protected Resources Division works to recover and conserve protected species — like whales and seals — while supporting responsible fishing and resource development. We provide management and oversight for the conservation and recovery of marine mammal species in Alaska under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Endangered Species Act, and Fur Seal Act. We provide guidance on the mitigation of fishery-marine mammal interactions and adaptive management measures to reduce impacts from disturbance, harassment, and takes. The division also implements agreements with Alaska Native groups to co-manage the subsistence harvest of nine marine mammal species.\n\nHabitat Conservation Division\n\nAquaculture Program\n\nIn Alaska, marine aquaculture contributes to restoration efforts, and is increasing economic opportunities for coastal communities through the farming of shellfish and seaweed. To date, commercial aquaculture activities have been relatively small-scale and have involved Pacific oysters, seaweed, blue mussels. Research activities include sea cucumbers, geoducks, and blue and red king crab. Finfish farming is prohibited by law in state waters. Currently, most farming operations are located along the coastline in either Southeast or Southcentral Alaska.\n\nInternational Coordination"
