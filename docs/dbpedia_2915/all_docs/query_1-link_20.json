        "text": "1967-1969 – Marine resource concerns lead Congress to authorize the creation of the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources. In January 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson appoints the 15 member commission to begin to study the nation’s marine problems and needs. Chaired by Julius A. Stratton of the Ford Foundation, it is simply referred to as the “Stratton Commission.” The Commission presents its final report to Congress on January 11, 1969 and recommends the creation of a new federal entity—the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency. The agency would include the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and other federal marine and anadromous fishery functions, the National Sea Grant College Program, and other agencies.\n\nEstablishing the Infrastructure of Science-Based Stewardship\n\n1969 – The National Environmental Policy Act requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision-making processes by considering the environmental impacts of their major proposed actions. Its primary goal is to foster better decision making that takes into account all of the environmental impacts of an action and involve the public in that decision making.\n\n1970 – President Nixon and Congress establish the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce under Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970. As part of the reorganization plan, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries is transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Commerce and renamed the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\n1971 – The Secretary of Commerce establishes the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee to advise on marine fisheries resource issues.\n\n1972 – The Marine Mammal Protection Act establishes a moratorium on taking marine mammals in U.S. waters and by U.S. citizens on the high seas.\n\n1973 – The Endangered Species Act protects species and populations whose numbers are low or declining. NOAA Fisheries is responsible for marine species under the law.\n\n1976 – The Fishery Conservation and Management Act establishes eight regional fishery management councils and a 200-mile fishery conservation zone.\n\n1978 – NOAA Fisheries begins receiving federal funding for the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program. In 1980, Congress enacts formal program authority to fund fishing industry development projects. It expands this authority in 1983, establishing a minimum percentage of grant funds to be used to provide financial assistance to projects.\n\n1980 – The original Fishery Conservation and Management Act is renamed the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act in honor of Washington state Senator Warren Magnuson.\n\nImplementing the Missions & Strengthening the Provisions\n\n1980 – The National Aquaculture Act of 1980 establishes aquaculture as a national policy priority for the United States and creates the Interagency Working Group on Aquaculture.\n\n1981 – Amendments to the Lacey Act make it illegal to trade in fish, wildlife, or plants taken in violation of any U.S. or tribal law, treaty, or regulation.\n\n1983 – President Reagan designates the fishery conservation zone as the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\n1986 – NOAA begins placing fisheries observers (professionally trained biological scientists with a bachelor’s degree in natural sciences and rigorous training) on domestic fishing vessels. Today, the program supports nearly 900 observers and at-sea monitors.\n\n1990 – The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act is passed, mandating the establishment of a national tuna tracking program."
