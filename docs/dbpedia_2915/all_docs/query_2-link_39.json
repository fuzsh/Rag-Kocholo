        "text": "Service Around the World\n\nWelcome to Social Securityâ€™s Office of Earnings & International Operations (OEIO) home page. The purpose of this site is to assist our customers who live outside the United States or plan to leave the country.\n\nOEIO manages the Social Security program outside the U.S. and implements the benefit provisions of international agreements. There are no Social Security offices outside the U.S., so OEIO receives assistance from the Department of State's embassies and consulates around the world.\n\nForeign Countries Served by Social Security\n\nIf you live outside of the United States, there are American embassies and consulates with trained personnel to assist you in seeking Social Security services (Canadian residents are served by domestic Social Security border offices). You can access information to contact our Social Security and consular staff by locating your country in the link below:\n\nCountry and Region Office Contact Information\n\nNotice Regarding Forms SSA-7161 and SSA-7162\n\nIn most countries, the postal service disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have been resolved.
