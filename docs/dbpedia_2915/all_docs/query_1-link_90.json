The outputs are intended to be used by a broad audience, are clear, concise, and written in plain language. We hope you find them interesting. We would love to hear what you think. If you wish you may send an email to NIDILRR's general email box at nidilrr-mailbox@acl.hhs.gov and include \"Comments on Organizational Highlights\" in the subject line of the email.\n\nNIDILRR FY 2021-2022 Organization Highlights (PDF 2609kb)\n\nNIDILRR FY 2020 Organization Highlights (PDF, 1,559KB)\n\nNIDILRR FY 2015 Organization Highlights (PDF, 5713KB)\n\nNIDILRR FY 2014 Organization Highlights (PDF, 4500KB)\n\nNIDILRR FY 2013 Organization Highlights (PDF, 4500KB)\n\nNIDILRR's History\n\nAs a result of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities amendments of 1978 (P.L. 95—602), which amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the National Institute on Handicapped Research (NIHR) was created.\n\nNIHR was charged with the prime responsibility of providing the required knowledge for defining needs, and of identifying the means for improving services to individuals with disabilities. NIHR was the result of intense effort by voluntary agencies of and for persons with disabilities, Congress, and the administration of the time.\n\nAccording to Leclair (1979), the original goal of NIHR was to focus in one agency a strong commitment to carry on a major program of research on all aspects of disability and the attendant socio-economic implications of the problems encountered by individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe scope of activities prescribed for NIHR was all encompassing and cut across practically every facet of rehabilitation and habilitation research activities imaginable, with no limitations in terms of type of disability, age, or intended goals. Finally, NIHR was created, not to duplicate services but rather to ensure that NIHR could proceed with “full authority if research programs were found inadequate or non-existent in a specific area of concern.\n\nNIHR retained most of the programs originally conducted by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) such as the Rehabilitation Engineering Centers (RECs), the Research and Training Centers (RTC), and the array of discrete psycho-social, vocational, and medical project grants that RSA and its predecessors had been conducting, in one form or other, since 1935.\n\nSome new initiatives and changes that NIHR spear-headed included, but were not limited to:\n\nResearch that improved the rehabilitation and habilitation of children with disabilities as well as older Americans with disabilities\n\nConduct of model research and training centers on innovative programs and techniques for evaluating, training, and placing individuals with disabilities in productive work;\n\nConduct of a research program to determine ways to train and retain rehabilitation professionals to serve in rural areas;\n\nDevelopment and implementation of a public education program, based on research results, to inform the public about the needs, concerns and problems of individuals with disabilities including information relating to family care, self-care, and preventative aspects of rehabilitation and habilitation;\n\nEstablishment of a program to improve the development, evaluation, production, and distribution of technological systems and devices that could improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities;\n\nDevelopment, in conjunction with other federal agencies, of statistical reports on the employment, health, income, and other demographic characteristics of individuals with disabilities; and\n\nThe conduct of projects by private profit-making organizations, non-profit public entities, as well with universities.\n\nIn 1986, again as a result of amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, NIHR would become known as the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR). Since its initial creation as NIHR in 1978, and its name change and expansion to NIDRR in 1986, NIDRR’s basic purpose and reason for being has not changed much. Expressed using updated terminology to reflect current times, NIDRR’s mission still remains to generate new knowledge and to promote its effective use to improve the abilities of people with disabilities to perform activities of their choice in the community. NIDRR still sponsors research and development in broad outcome domains of health and function, employment, and participation and community living. And ultimately NIDRR still remains committed to expanding society’s capacity to provide full opportunities and accommodations for its citizens with disabilities.\n\nAnd now, with the passage of the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act, NIDRR has a new home in the Administration for Community Living within the Department of Human Services as well as a new name — the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR).\n\nNIDILRR Planning Documents\n\nNIDILRR has several documents that inform and guide its planning efforts; they are each described in a section below.\n\nNIDILRR's Long-Range Plan\n\nThe legislative requirements governing NIDILRRs Long Range plan are described in 29 U.S.C. 762(h). Note: Scroll down to Section (h) of this page.\n\nThe National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) at ACL has published a Long-Range Plan for 2024-2028.\n\nAs mandated by Congress, NIDILRR’s LRP provides a five-year agenda for advancing the vital work being done in applied research and development to improve the inclusion of people with disabilities into all aspects of society.\n\nShaped by extensive stakeholder input, the new LRP continues to emphasize scientific rigor and the need for research that is highly relevant to the lives of people with disabilities. In addition, it provides data to show progress made on goals included in the last LRP, demonstrating NIDILRR’s commitment to the field. The plan also contains several new areas of emphasis, including:\n\nExpanded commitment to broader inclusion of people with disabilities across the research enterprise;\n\nNew opportunities for international research and development activities;\n\nAn increased focus on the enabling or disabling characteristics of the communities in which we live; and\n\nCall to the field to pursue work that has an intersectional focus.\n\n“Our new long-range plan presents a bold research agenda for the next five years and represents an important evolution in how we think about, describe, and engage on research topics related to disability,” said NIDILRR’s director, Dr. Anjali Forber-Pratt. “The plan lays out a modernized approach to guide our planning and activities, with a focus on ensuring that people with disabilities are centered in all facets of disability research and increasing expectations for inclusion, accessibility and workplace supports for disabled people. It sets the bar high for all of us in the disability research field – starting with NIDILRR itself.”\n\nRead NIDILRR's Long-Range Plan for 2024-2028\n\nPrevious Long-Range Plans:\n\nRead NIDILRR’s previous 2018-2023 Long-Range Plan.\n\nRead NIDILRR's previous Long-Range Plan for Fiscal Years 2013-2017.\n\nNIDILRR's Logic Model\n\nThe logic model was designed by Dr. Margaret Campbell, former NIDILRR Senior Scientist and Evaluation Lead with assistance from Dr. William Schutz in 2005. The logic model is composed of various elements and the interrelationships among them.\n\nThe entire logic model focuses on NIDILRR’s targeted outcome arenas and does not provide information on inputs, activities, and outputs. The omission of these other elements found in traditional logic models was intentional because at the time our goal was to develop a one-page tool that helped us visualize our outcomes. Additionally, we intended to add information on inputs, activities, outputs, but did not include them because that section of the logic of the logic model had not been fully developed at the time of publication in the Federal Register.\n\nNIDILRR’s Logic Model, (formerly NIDRR in 2006) was included in our 2005-2009 Long-Range Plan as an appendix. The entire Long-Range Plan was published in Volume 71, Number 31 of the Federal Register on Wednesday February 15, 2006.\n\nA textual description of the logic model is presented below for visitors using assistive technologies such as screen readers.\n\nThe NIDILRR logic identifies NIDILRR's targeted outcome arenas. The first textbox at the top of says situation: significant gaps exist in knowledge, skills, policy, and practice and system capacity that prevent people with disabilities from having equal opportunities for employment, health and function and participation.\n\nNow going from left to right there are six text boxes with forward-pointing arrows connecting them.\n\nThe first box is labeled Short-term outcome arenas which are advances in understanding, knowledge, skills, and learning systems that happen via our capacity building, research and development, and knowledge translation efforts. Our research and development efforts produce discoveries, theories, measures, and methods, and interventions, devices, and environmental adaptations.\n\nThe second textbox is labeled intermediate Beneficiaries which include researchers, clinicians, service providers, educators, policy experts, federal and non-federal partners, industry representatives and product developers, employers, media, consumer advocates, and people with disabilities and family members. In short, intermediate beneficiaries re those that benefit from our short-term outcome arenas.\n\nThe third text box is labeled Intermediate Outcome Arenas which show adoption and use of new knowledge leading to changes and improvements in policy, practice, behavior, and system capacity.\n\nThe fourth text box is labeled Intended Beneficiaries which are people with disabilities and family members.\n\nThe fifth text box is labeled Long-Term Outcome Arenas which is where changes in overall conditions happen. Changes in overall conditions include the elimination of disparities between people with disabilities and the general population in the following areas employment, participation and community living, and health and function.\n\nThe sixth and final text box is labeled Major Domains of NIDILRR's mission. A Venn diagram with three intersecting circles represent our major life domains: employment, participation and community living, and health and function. And this Venn diagram is encircled by the domains of technology and demographics because these last domains affect three major life domains in the Venn diagram.\n\nAt the bottom of those six main boxes is a long rectangular box labeled performance assessment and outcomes evaluation. This long rectangular box has arrows pointing upward to the six text boxes.\n\nAnd just below the box labeled performance assessment and outcomes evaluation is an even longer rectangular box (with arrows pointing upward) labeled contextual factors. Contextual factors include variable funding; scientific and technological advancements; societal attitudes; economic conditions; changing public policies; coordination and cooperation with other government entities.\n\nNIDILRR's Research and Development Frameworks\n\nNIDILRR funds research and development efforts that are aimed at generating new knowledge and promoting its use and adoption among a variety of internal and external stakeholders that make up the disability and rehabilitation community.\n\nThese research and development efforts must be guided and informed by the use of frameworks. NIDILRR has one framework to guide its research-funded efforts and one framework to guide its development-funded efforts.\n\nTo learn more about these frameworks visit NIDILRR's Frameworks' page.\n\nNIDILRR's Legislation and Policy Regulations\n\nThe Basic Business of NIDILRR According to Its Legislative Mandate\n\nThe core business of NIDILRR is to award grants and contracts to “states and public or private agencies and organizations, including institutions of higher education, Indian tribes and tribal organizations.” These entities are then supposed to use this money to plan and conduct research, demonstration projects, training and related activities designed to:\n\n- Develop methods, procedures, and rehabilitation technology, that maximize the full inclusion and integration into society, employment, independent living, family support, and economic and social self-sufficiency of individuals with disabilities, especially individuals with the most significant disabilities; and\n\n- Improve the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation and other rehabilitation services. Source: 29 USC Section 764.\n\nThe Rules that Help Translate the Intent of the Law into Agency Operating Guidelines\n\nThe Code of Federal Regulations (known as CFR) are the rules that help translate the intent of a Law into broad agency operating guidelines. With its move to the Administration for Community Living within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the NIDILRR consolidated its Code of Federal Regulations in one place. This new location is 45 CFR Part 1330. Read about the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Final Rule that created these new regulations.\n\nThe National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) is a federal government agency that came into existence in 1978 as NIHR within the U.S. Department of Education. It operates today under a federal law known as Title II of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This law became part of the United States Code (USC) and NIDILRR’s mandate and mission. It is described in Title 29, Chapter 16, Subchapter II, Section 762.\n\nNIDILRR's Leadership and Staff\n\nThe Acting Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) is Dr. Kristi Hill. Dr. Hill's biography is available on the Administration for Community Living's Leadership Page.
