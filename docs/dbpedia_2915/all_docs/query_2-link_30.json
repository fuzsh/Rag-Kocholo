        "text": "Direct Deposit: Once benefit payments are sent from the United States, your international direct deposit arrival depends on your foreign financial institution’s processing time.\n\nVA Claim Exam: In support of a disability claim, VA will schedule your claim exam (compensation and pension exam) as close as possible to your home.â¯ It is very important that you provide your physical address, even if you utilize a separate mailing address.â¯You can provide your physical address by completing VA Form 21-4138 (Statement in Support of Claim) and uploading it with your claim at VA.gov or through Quick Submit.â¯ â¯Additionally, you should provide your most current contact information (telephone number and e-mail address) as we will utilize multiple means to notify you of your exam date, time and location.â¯ If we do not have your physical address and current contact information, your claim may be delayed or denied.â¯ Additional claim exam information can be found here: VA Claim Exam (C&P Exam) | Veterans Affairs\n\nCurrency Conversion: International Treasury Services will not charge you a currency conversion fee for payments sent overseas; however, your foreign financial institution may charge fees as applicable.\n\nForeign Schools: Education benefits are offered to eligible Veterans to attend approved programs at foreign schools. Visit our Foreign School Information for Students page to learn more. You can use our WEAMS Institution Search tool to find foreign schools with approved programs."
