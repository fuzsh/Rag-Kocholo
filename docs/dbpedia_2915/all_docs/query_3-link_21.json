That percentage was still based on 2/3rds or 3/3rds of the full locality percentage (in 2010 and 2011, respectively). It just meant that the employee could not receive the full amount of the locality pay. This also affected the computation of the COLA reduction for certain grandfathered employees, as provided in NAREAA section 1915(b)(2)-(3)."
