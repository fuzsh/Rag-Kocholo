        "text": "June 2024 Trade Gap is $73.1 Billion\n\nThe U.S. goods and services trade deficit decreased from $75.0 billion in May (revised) to $73.1 billion in June, as exports increased more than imports. The goods deficit decreased $2.5 billion to $97.4 billion, and the services surplus decreased $0.6 billion to $24.2 billion.\n\nBEA: Taking Economic Statistics Personally Since 1938\n\nA blog from BEA Director Vipin Arora\n\nWhen I hear the phrase “personal income,” I think about my paycheck. When we talk about personal income in the context of BEA’s economic statistics, however, it’s my paycheck, your paycheck, your cousin’s paycheck—and much more.\n\nGross Domestic Product for Puerto Rico, 2022\n\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) for Puerto Rico decreased 2.5 percent in 2022 after increasing 4.1 percent in 2021, according to statistics released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nThe decrease in real GDP in 2022 reflected an increase in imports—which are a subtraction item in the calculation of GDP—as well as decreases in private fixed investment and exports. Personal consumption expenditures, private inventory investment, and government spending increased.\n\nPersonal Income and Outlays, June 2024\n\nPersonal income increased $50.4 billion (0.2 percent at a monthly rate) in June. Disposable personal income (DPI)—personal income less personal current taxes—increased $37.7 billion (0.2 percent). Personal outlays—the sum of personal consumption expenditures, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments—increased $59.3 billion (0.3 percent) and consumer spending increased $57.6 billion (0.3 percent). Personal saving was $703.0 billion and the personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was 3.4 percent in June."
