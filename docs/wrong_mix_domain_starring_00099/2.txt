Lindsay Loahn has reportedly been trying to get hold of actor Seth Rogan (Knocked Up, Superbad) for one of her new movies. She told Nylon magazine "Weâre trying to get Seth Rogen for this project, but Seth wonât call us back. So call us back, Seth, if youâre reading this!".

Is this broad for real? Shit, put down the crack pipe! Lohan also went on to say that the media's obsession with her personal life has started to hurt her career...

"Thereâs not much I can do about the fact that Iâve become a kind of obsession. I canât change that. And yes, all of that stuff has hurt my career, but I really donât feel like I should have to prove myself to anyone because of living out my college years in the public eye. Iâm glad everything happened the way it did."
