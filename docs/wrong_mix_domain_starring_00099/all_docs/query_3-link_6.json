T. F’ or ‘Down To F--k’ is from 'Superbad.'”\n\n• “My good friend @mrDaveKrumholtz came up with the title 'Superbad' while we were smoking weed at the oakwood.”\n\n• “Danny McBride is an extra in the background of the first party scene in 'Superbad.'”\n\n• “Just like in 'Superbad,' Mike Snider actually was the first guy to get a fake ID and it was awesome.”\n\n• “I wrote it with my best friend in high school and we still write together. It’s lovely.”"
