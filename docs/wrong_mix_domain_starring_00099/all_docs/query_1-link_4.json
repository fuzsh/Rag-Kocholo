Shit, put down the crack pipe! Lohan also went on to say that the media's obsession with her personal life has started to hurt her career...\n\n\"Thereâs not much I can do about the fact that Iâve become a kind of obsession. I canât change that. And yes, all of that stuff has hurt my career, but I really donât feel like I should have to prove myself to anyone because of living out my college years in the public eye. Iâm glad everything happened the way it did.\""
