        "text": "Screen Gems has announced that 20-year-old actress Emma Stone will headline their upcoming project Easy A, written by New York playwright Bert V. Royal. Easy A is being described as a modern, high school-set retelling of Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic \"Scarlet Letter\". In this film, Stone will see her life paralleling Hawthorne's heroine Hester Prynne after she pretends to be the school slut in hopes that she'll benefit from the notion she's promiscuous. Fired Up director Will Gluck will direct this sure-to-be awful comedy. Unfortunately I don't expect this to be anything I'll ever care about even once it's finished.\n\nEven though the prospect of seeing Emma Stone as the \"school slut\" is exciting to a lot of young guys, this is bound to be another dreadful teenage comedy along the lines of Fired Up and Sex Drive and Miss March. Of course, these kinds of films have their place in our culture, sadly, and that's why this is getting so much early attention. But fret not, because besides this casting news, I'm not planning to even think about it again, even if they try to coax me with a visit to the sex-laden set. However, if teenage comedies that rip off such timeless classics as \"The Scarlet Letter\" are your thing, then maybe you should keep an eye on this."
