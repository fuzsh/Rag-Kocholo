        "text": "American actress (born 1970)\n\nFor other people named Heather Graham, see Heather Graham (disambiguation).\n\nHeather Joan Graham (born January 29, 1970) is an American actress.[1][2] After appearing in television commercials, her first starring role in a feature film came with the teen comedy License to Drive (1988), followed by the critically acclaimed film Drugstore Cowboy (1989).[3][4] She then played supporting roles on the television series Twin Peaks (1991), and in films such as Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and Swingers (1996). She gained critical praise for her role as \"Rollergirl\" in the film Boogie Nights (1997).[5] This led to major roles in the comedy films Bowfinger and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (both 1999).\n\nGraham had leading roles in Say It Isn't So (2001) and From Hell (2001), and continued to play supporting roles in the films Mary (2005); The Hangover (2009) and its sequel, The Hangover Part III (2013); At Any Price (2012); and Horns (2013). She has had roles on television series such as Scrubs (2004) and Californication (2014).\n\nGraham is a public advocate for Children International[6] and supported the climate change campaign Global Cool in 2007.[7]\n\nGraham was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[8] The elder of two children, her younger sister Aimee Graham is also an actress and writer. Her mother Joan (née Bransfield) is a teacher and author of children's books,[9] and her father James Graham is a retired FBI agent.[10] Her family relocated repeatedly before moving to Agoura Hills, California, when she was nine.[11] She was introduced to acting during a school production of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nAfter high school, Graham enrolled in extension classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied English for two years.[12] Against her parents' wishes, Graham withdrew from UCLA to pursue acting full time.[13]\n\nGraham's first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in Mrs. Soffel (1984).[14] Her first credited film appearance was in the television film Student Exchange. In 1986, she appeared on a special \"Teen Week\" episode of the NBC game show Scrabble. Then she appeared in numerous television commercials, and an episode of the sitcom Growing Pains in 1987. Her first high-profile starring role came in the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle License to Drive (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim's character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy Heathers (1988), which had an expletive-rich script.[11] The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger's mother in flashbacks in their film, Twins.[15]\n\nIn 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy as Nadine, a young, drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive.[16] After Drugstore Cowboy, she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's dark comedy I Love You to Death (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film Shout (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.\n\nAfter Graham co-starred with Benicio del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in Twin Peaks, where she appeared in the final six episodes. Following the show's cancellation, Graham reprised the role of Blackburn in the 1992 prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.[10]\n\nShe featured in Diggstown (1992), alongside James Woods; the well-received Six Degrees of Separation (1993), alongside Will Smith; and The Ballad of Little Jo (1993), alongside Ian McKellen before reteaming with Gus Van Sant for the critically panned film adaptation of Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, alongside Uma Thurman.[17] The same year she co-starred as Mary Kennedy Taylor in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle. In 1995, she starred as Jackie in the poorly received Desert Winds and guest-starred in an episode of the television series Fallen Angels. She had a small but important role in Swingers (1996), where she played Lorraine, Jon Favreau's love interest.[18] She also played a small role as Maggie Bowen in Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story (1996).\n\nGraham's popularity significantly increased after playing a young porn star in the critically acclaimed film Boogie Nights (1997). The cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The same year, she also starred in the Gregg Araki film Nowhere, and had a cameo in the horror hit Scream 2 as a fictionalised version of herself, portraying Casey Becker in the film within a film Stab. She was subsequently cast in Two Girls and a Guy (1998), a film mainly based upon dialogue between the characters, shot in 11 days,[19] which co-starred Robert Downey Jr. and Natasha Gregson; and the sci-fi film Lost in Space, which was met with mostly negative reviews, and grossed $69,117,629 domestically on a production budget of $80 million. The cast was signed on for sequels that remain unmade.[20][21]\n\nShe starred as Felicity Shagwell in the sequel Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), which was a box-office hit. Shagwell is one of her best-known roles and became a fan favorite.[22] Her turn as Shagwell also earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actress. She appeared in the music video for Lenny Kravitz's cover of \"American Woman\". Also in 1999, Graham co-starred as Daisy in the movie Bowfinger, opposite Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.\n\nThe 2000 film Committed was her first starring vehicle. She played Joline, a devoted-beyond-reason young wife looking for the husband who left her. While the film itself received mixed reviews, the Rotten Tomatoes summary of critics felt that \"Graham shows she can play a central character\", but noted \"she's not enough to make Committed successful\".[23] The following year, she co-starred as Annie Matthews, an unhappily married woman, in Edward Burns' Sidewalks of New York. In 2002, she starred with Joseph Fiennes in Chen Kaige's English-language debut film Killing Me Softly, which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being: \"Respected director Chen Kaige's first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue\".[24] In 2009, the site also rated it No. 12 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.\n\nGraham's other appearances in mainstream fare include playing a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper murder victim Mary Kelly in the film From Hell (2001), starring Johnny Depp; Anger Management (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson; the Farrelly Brothers comedy Say It Isn't So (2001), opposite Sally Field; The Guru, co-starring Jimi Mistry, and Hope Springs (2003), co-starring Colin Firth.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2008, Graham starred in several independent films Gray Matters, Broken, Adrift in Manhattan (all 2007), and Miss Conception (2008), most of which received generally negative reviews and went largely unnoticed at the box office.[25][22] Her 2005 film Mary holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, her first \"Fresh\" film since Bowfinger.[26] The film premiered at the 2005 Venice Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Prize, as well as three smaller awards. The film also played at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, Deauville Film Festival, and San Sebastián International Film Festival, and co-starred Juliette Binoche, Forest Whitaker, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine. In 2006, she co-starred in Bobby as Angela; the film's cast was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\nGraham also spoke about developing a comedy film titled The Accidental Virgin, which would have focused on \"female sexual confusion\", telling the story of a woman who has not had sex in a year. The film has not been made. She also stated she would be interested in directing in the future if it is \"something that, its burning in my mind that I need to do\".[10]\n\nOn television, Graham played herself in an episode of the TV series Sex and the City. She was given special guest-star status on nine episodes of Scrubs during its fourth season (2004–2005), and also appeared as George Michael Bluth's ethics teacher in an episode of Arrested Development in 2004. She played Emily Sanders in Emily's Reasons Why Not, but the sitcom was cancelled after airing only one episode.\n\nIn 2009, Graham played the stripper with a heart of gold, Jade, in The Hangover, which was released to critical and box-office success. She won the role after Lindsay Lohan turned it down.[27][28][29] Though she did not return for the sequel The Hangover Part II, she reprised her role in the final installment of the trilogy, The Hangover Part III.[30] In 2010, she starred in Boogie Woogie, followed by roles in the unsuccessful films Father of Invention, 5 Days of War, Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer (all 2011), and About Cherry (2012). Graham was also credited for archive footage of her from Scream 2 re-used in Scream 4 (2011).[31][32][33][34]\n\nGraham voiced the character of Antonia Bayle in the online role-playing video game EverQuest 2.[35][36]\n\nShe played Meredith Crown in At Any Price, which stars Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron, and was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and later screened as an official selection at the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals.[37] Other roles include mob lawyer Annette Stratton-Osborne in Behaving Badly and short story writer Mary Bellanova in My Dead Boyfriend (both 2014). She wrote a comedy screenplay called Half Magic, which in 2013 she stated she wanted to direct. She said the story focuses on \"these female friends and sexuality and about people having a sense of shame about sexuality and learning how to have a healthier attitude about it [...] It also deals with male/female relationships and sexism\".[38] The film was released in 2018.\n\nIn 2012, she was a member of the jury of the 15th Shanghai International Film Festival.[39]\n\nIn 2014, she starred in the second adaptation of the V. C. Andrews novel Flowers in the Attic on the Lifetime network. She played the character of Corrine Dollanganger, an evil mother who locks her four children in an attic to receive an inheritance from her dying father.[40] Graham also appeared in two TV films sequels based on the V.C. Andrews' series: Petals on the Wind and If There Be Thorns, continuing to play the role of Corrine Dollanganger.[41] She appeared in the final season of Californication as the mother of David Duchovny's long-lost son.[42]\n\nIn 2018, she co-starred in the David Cross dark comedy series Bliss, which was released by the BritBox streaming service. It starred Stephen Mangan as Andrew, a fraudulent travel writer, who struggles to maintain long-term relationships with two partners, Kim (Graham) and Denise (Jo Hartley), who are not aware of one another.[43][44]\n\nIn 2023, Graham starred as Charlotte Sanders in the Netflix Christmas-themed film Best. Christmas. Ever! alongside Brandy Norwood, Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeño.[45][46][47][48]\n\nGraham wrote, directed, and starred in Chosen Family, which is set to be released in 2024.[49][50]\n\nBesides her acting work, Graham is also an activist who serves as a public advocate for the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Children International.[6] She stated that what she likes about Children International is that \"you are helping a child have a better life. It's great for that child to know that someone who lives in another country cares about them\". Graham works with the Cambodian Children's Fund, also an NGO, which provides supplies and education, and campaigns to stop slavery. \"There's a lot of human trafficking in Cambodia,\" Graham has said. \"Women are dying because they don't have $15 to give birth in a hospital. The [Children's Fund] provides free education, clean water and healthcare for communities... We're creating future leaders who will be able to help themselves.\"[6][51]\n\nIn 2007 she supported the climate change campaign Global Cool and appeared in Shekhar Kapur's short film Global Cool alongside Sienna Miller.[52]\n\nGraham is considered a sex symbol. She was ranked at number 40 in FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2000, number 95 in 2001 list, number 97 in the 2002 list, number 74 in the 2005 list and at number 98 in 2006 list. In 2001, she was named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People by People. In 2003, she posed for a photoshoot by photographer Sam Jones during which she was levitated several feet into the air by a magician who later also sawed her in half.[53] Also in 2003, Graham appeared on the cover of Time for an article titled \"The Science of Meditation\".[54][55] To promote Emily's Reasons Why Not, she posed for a LIFE cover story, printed weeks in advance of the assumed series schedule, referring to her as \"TV's sexiest star\", which appeared in the January 27, 2006, issue.[56][57]\n\nGraham is often cast in sexual roles, including those of Felicity Shagwell (Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), porn stars Rollergirl (Boogie Nights) and Sharonna (The Guru), prostitute Mary Kelly (From Hell), porn director Margaret (About Cherry), and stripper Jade (The Hangover and The Hangover, Part III). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that \"our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be 'good' mothers who would never do those things?\" and that she likes \"the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex\".[58][59][60]\n\nIn 2005, Graham became the spokeswoman for the Garnier brand of hair care products.[61]\n\nIn 2017, Graham recounted a time in the early 2000s when Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein indirectly implied that he would give her a role of her choice if she slept with him. Later, Graham indicated she canceled a planned meeting with Weinstein at a hotel when a friend was unable to accompany her. Graham did not have further contact with Weinstein and she was never cast in any films he produced.[62]\n\nGraham has been estranged from her parents in the past. Regarding the media's perception of her relationship with her parents, she stated: \"I don't really like to talk about my parents because I just feel that it gets misinterpreted in the press.\"[63][64]\n\nGraham has been practising transcendental meditation since 1991[60] after being introduced to it by David Lynch. She has also expressed her dislike of reality television, stating in a 2007 interview: \"I think some of it, it seems strange – why do we all want to watch people be so miserable? Other people's pain and misery – it seems kind of sad.\"[65]\n\nIn 1992, Graham dated James Woods, her co-star in the film Diggstown.[66] She later dated British rock star Adam Ant.[67] From 2008 to 2011, she was in a relationship with Israeli screenwriter Yaniv Raz.[68] She also dated Heath Ledger.[69]\n\nShe has been dating John de Neufville since 2022.[70]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1984 Mrs. Soffel Factory Girl Uncredited 1987 Student Exchange Dorrie Ryder 1988 License to Drive Mercedes Lane Twins Young Mary Ann Benedict Uncredited 1989 Drugstore Cowboy Nadine 1990 I Love You to Death Bridget 1991 Guilty as Charged Kimberly Shout Sara Benedict 1992 Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me Annie Blackburn Diggstown Emily Forrester 1993 The Ballad of Little Jo Mary Addie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues Cowgirl Heather Six Degrees of Separation Elizabeth 1994 Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle Mary Kennedy Taylor Don't Do It Suzanna 1995 Desert Winds Jackie Terrified Olive 1996 Swingers Lorraine Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story Maggie Bowen 1997 Nowhere Lilith Two Girls and a Guy Carla Bennett Boogie Nights Brandy / Rollergirl Kiss & Tell Susan Pretsel Scream 2 'Stab' Casey Becker Cameo 1998 Lost in Space Dr. Judy Robinson 1999 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Felicity Shagwell Bowfinger Daisy 2000 Committed Joline 2001 Say It Isn't So Josephine Wingfield Sidewalks of New York Annie From Hell Mary Jane Kelly 2002 Killing Me Softly Alice Tallis The Guru Sharonna 2003 Anger Management Kendra Uncredited cameo Hope Springs Mandy 2004 Blessed Samantha Howard 2005 Mary Elizabeth Younger Cake Pippa McGee Also executive producer 2006 The Oh in Ohio Justine Bobby Angela Gray Matters Gray Baldwin Broken Hope 2007 Adrift in Manhattan Rose Phipps Have Dreams, Will Travel Aunt 2008 Alien Love Triangle Elizabeth Short film Miss Conception Georgina Salt Baby on Board Angela Marks 2009 ExTerminators Alex The Hangover Jade Boogie Woogie Beth Freemantle 2010 Father of Invention Phoebe 2011 The Flying Machine Georgie Son of Morning Josephine Tuttle 5 Days of War Miriam Eisner Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer Aunt Opal Moody 2012 About Cherry Margaret At Any Price Meredith Crown 2013 The Hangover Part III Jade Compulsion Amy Horns Veronica 2014 Goodbye to All That Stephanie Behaving Badly Annette Stratton-Osborne 2016 Norm of the North Vera Voice My Dead Boyfriend Mary McCrawley 2017 Wetlands Savannah Last Rampage Dorothy Tison 2018 Half Magic Honey Also director and writer 2019 The Rest of Us Cami 2020 Desperados Angel de la Paz Love, Guaranteed Tamara Taylor Wander Shelly Luscomb 2021 The Last Son Anna 2023 On a Wing and a Prayer Terri White Suitable Flesh Elizabeth Derby [71] Oracle Kate Simmons The Other Zoey Paula Best.
