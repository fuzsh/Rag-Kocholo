        "text": "After three election victories and 10 years leading the country, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper has left Canadian politics, upon which he left such an indelible mark.\n\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, in 1959, Mr Harper became involved in politics while still at school.\n\nAfter obtaining a masters degree from the University of Calgary he went on to work as a political aide.\n\nMr Harper won a parliamentary seat for the Reform Party in 1993, but quit four years later to work for a conservative lobby group.\n\nHe returned to parliament in 2002 as head of the Canadian Alliance and leader of the opposition. A year later his party merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nThe new Conservative Party, with Mr Harper at the helm, reunited Canada's political right after years of disarray.\n\nBut the father-of-two could not beat Liberal Party leader Paul Martin in the 2004 election, and Mr Martin was able to form a minority government.\n\nObservers say the Conservative Party's controversial statements on abortion and same-sex marriage lost them key votes on that occasion.\n\nNext time around, Mr Harper - a keen strategist - managed to marginalise the more extreme elements of his party.\n\nHis election as Canada's prime minister in 2006 reversed more than a decade of Liberal Party rule in parliament.\n\nIt also completed Mr Harper's transformation from hard-line right-winger to a progressive conservative with a party positioned at the centre of the political spectrum.\n\nSometimes seen as an aloof figure more at home with a spreadsheet than working a crowd, the Alberta MP managed to stay at the helm of a minority government longer than expected.\n\nAccusations that he was a pro-Bush \"extremist\" who would curb abortion rights and put an end to same-sex marriages failed to stick.\n\nBut he was also helped by the disarray among the opposition Liberals and a perceived lack of appetite among Canadians to head back to the polls.\n\nAfter two years he called for a snap poll a year ahead of schedule, complaining that parliament was \"dysfunctional\" and deadlocked.\n\nIn the 2008 election he increased his party's seats but still fell short of holding a majority.\n\nBut he received a fillip the following year when the newly-inaugurated Barack Obama chose Canada as the destination for his first foreign trip as US president.\n\nMr Harper received a lot of criticism in 2010 over the $1.1bn cost (US$1.1bn; Â£730m) of staging the double summit of G8 and G20 leaders in Toronto.\n\nA temporary water feature dubbed the \"fake lake\" came to symbolise what many critics saw as Mr Harper's extravagant spending.\n\nBy the time his opponents triggered the 2011 election, though, Mr Harper was able to present himself as the stable, familiar guiding hand of Canadian politics."
