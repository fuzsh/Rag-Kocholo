        "text": "Stephen Harper was born on April 30, 1959, in Toronto. In 2006 Mr. Harper was elected as Prime Minister of Canada and would remain in office until 2015. Mr. Harper's priority as Prime Minister was to secure Canada's economic recovery. He successfully brought the federal tax burden to its lowest level in half a century, and with the budget balanced in 2015, the Canadian Government was able to provide greater tax relief and increased benefits for Canadian families. In this segment, Stephen Harper discusses The House of Commons, taxation issues, the war in Iraq, the environment and the Canadian/U.S. relationship."
