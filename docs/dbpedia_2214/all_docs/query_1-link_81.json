        "text": "Angélique Kidjo\n\nCountry of origin:\n\nBenin. Currently resides in Paris, France\n\nType of music generally:\n\nWorld music, pop/rock, dance\n\nStatus:\n\nMost recent release, Angélique Kidjo Sings with the Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg (live, 2015); most recent studio release, Eve (2014)\n\nSee also:\n\nAngélique Kidjo Homepage\n\nCovers/own material:\n\nOwn and co-written, occasional cover\n\nGeneral comments:\n\nAngélique Kidjo is an amazing singer-songwriter from Benin, a tiny country in West Africa. She sings in English, French, and her native languages of Yoruba and Fon. Her music—well, there's that powerful voice that's comfortable in different languages, stylistic influences from traditional African music to rock, pop, r&b and hip-hop. She uses both African and western instruments. Most of her songs are upbeat, danceable, very rhythmic. But her slower songs and ballads are equally excellent. (JoAnn Whetsell)\n\nGlad to see someone else out there liking Angélique Kidjo. Her talents blew me away when I first heard her a couple of years ago. For those who like \"World Music\" she is really awesome. The energy she brings to her songs is very invigorating and infectious, and the sound is different enough to make it very interesting stuff. (joc@netaxs.com)\n\nComments about live performance:\n\nI saw Angelique in the fall of 1998 here at Oberlin, which was the first stop on her U.S. tour for Oremi. It was one of the best concerts I've been to EVER. Hands down. She had so much energy; she had the entire crowd on their feet dancing before the end of the first song, and kept them that way the whole time. She played mostly songs from Oremi and Fifa, but also some older songs and a ballad she said had been made famous by Miriam Makeba—so beautiful. Also her dancing and the back-up singers, dressed in African costume, and colorful prints draping the stage added to the incredible performance. (JoAnn Whetsell)\n\nAngélique Kidjo was awesome. She's much shorter than I thought she'd be, but has a really great smile. The show features a lot of songs from her latest album Fifa (meaning \"Peace\"), and the new stuff sounds great. Many of the songs feature English choruses—which is a departure for her, but they still sound great. She toured with two backup singers, a drummer, a percussionist, a keyboardist, guitarist, bass, and a pretty wild dancer. For the first 40 minutes or so, it was all new material, but then she covered all my favorites including \"Batonga\", and an awesome version of \"Adouma\" which had everyone dancing—not just the people on the dance floor. She then came out and did an encore consisting of two songs, a ballad and \"Agolo\". A great show that was a lot of fun. Her voice is so loud, powerful and clear—though I do wish she worked on her dynamics a little more. Even her ballads are loud, powerful and clear—which can get a little tiresome, but the danceable rhythms more than make up for it.

This album has the most Western influences on it: from r&b and hip-hop influences, some jazz even, to a Jimi Hendrix cover to appearances by Cassandra Wilson and Kelly Price. For the most part it works very well, but my favorite songs on here are the ones that are sung all or mostly not in English such as \"Babalao\" \"Loloye\" and \"Orubaba\". (JoAnn Whetsell)\n\nA friend turned me on to her. With this album someone decided she should be more mainstream R-n-Bish, to get her \"known\", before they drop her from her label. NO african influences!!! Only 1 song listenable, in my opinion and my friend's, \"Voodoo Chile\". Slight return—no guitar, a favorite from her youth, kinda neat. (shudder) What the suits do to talent!!!!

It is impossible to listen to it without moving, even if I'm only dancing in my chair. The third in Angélique's series of albums exploring the influence of African music in the diaspora, Oyaya! takes on Afro-Latin/Caribbean music. Even more than the previous 2 albums (Oremi which explored American music and Black Ivory Soul which explored Brazilian music), Oyaya! blends the music rather than using it as an influence. I'm not sure which countries or styles of Caribbean music; her website mentions salsa, calypso, meringue, and ska. But it doesn't really matter. What matters is that it makes me smile, it makes me dance. Angélique's voice is as beautiful and sensual as ever, and so is the music. If you like dance-y Latin music, give this a try; if not, try one of Angélique's other albums instead.

It's as upbeat, positive, and fun, but I think it's a stronger album. You can really hear her growth as an artist and the influence of the last years she's spent exploring the African roots of American, Brazilian, and Caribbean music. She covers the Rolling Stones' \"Gimme Shelter\" with Joss Stone, goes reggae with Ziggy Marley, and even does a vocal version of Ravel's \"Bolero\" which won me over despite much initial skepticism. The songs with just Angélique and her band are as strong as those with guests. And the quieter songs are as good as the fast ones. It's a testimony to her strength as an artist that amid the guests and the various styles she remains firmly in command of it all.

I love spirited songs like \"Zelie,\" \"Kelele\" and \"Dil Mein Chhupa Ke Pyar Ka Too\" while others are kind of boring. There are so many styles, including American R&B and soul, African traditionals, and Bollywood, that the songs don't fit together easily, particularly the collaborations with Dianne Reeves and with Bono and John Legend (on Curtis Mayfield's \"Move On Up\"), which just aren't great covers to begin with. Still there is much to like, and some of the parts are much better than the sum.

The material, originals and covers pulled from her albums and contributions to compilations, ranges widely in style and tempo, but fits together well. The cover of Curtis Mayfield's \"Move On Up\" (this time with Branford Marsalis) is better than the one on Õÿö with Bono and John Legend. And the new cover of Vampire Weekend's \"I Think Ur a Contra\" is wonderful. As a longtime fan with fond memories of seeing Angélique in concert, I'm pretty happy.

Angéélique's own voice is as powerful as ever, and the music is almost entirely upbeat and celebratory. It makes me smile and sing along, and it makes me want to dance. This is a good thing. Eve is a great album.

The best tracks (\"Kelele,\" \"Fifa,\" \"Nanae\") really bring out a different side to the songs compared to their original recordings. \"Bahia,\" much darker here than the original version, is a good example. This continues to grow on me with every listen. (JoAnn Whetsell)\n\nOne of the best albums of the year.
