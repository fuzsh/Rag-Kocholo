Bonga ‘Agua Rara’ Findstand Tk 2 3.59\n\nThe artist Bonga from Angola is to Angolan pop music what Bunny Wailer and Jimmy Cliff are to reggae. He rose to fame in the 70’s with a loyal South African following today-though he now resides in Portugal. One often gets s taste of his enthusiasm for Afro Cuban music be it for dancing or listening. Agua Rara in the tune.\n\nBest of Bonga, Lusafrica, 2009\n\n#1062 November 8, 2014 No. 10\n\nOutcues\n\n7P Close\n\nCharlie Byrd & Friends ‘Soft Lights and Sweet Music’ #674 Tk 3 4.11\n\nBluebyrd, Concord Jazz, 1979\n\n8P Close\n\nGeovani And Yuri Da Cunha ‘ Candongueiro’ Tk 2 4:25\n\nAfrican Beat, Putumayo World Music, 2013 (II)\n\n9P Close\n\nPrince Kupi ‘Botsotsi’ ClipNo.3 Tk 1 4:23\n\nSmooth Africa II – Exploring The Soul, Heads Up International, 2003\n\n10P Close\n\nMax De Castro ‘A Historia….do Carnaval’ Alb Tk 4 4:38"
