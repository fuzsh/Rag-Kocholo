        "text": "Green Day kicked off the North American leg of their Saviors tour on Monday with a career-spanning, 37-song set at Washington, D.C.'s Nationals Park, supported by the Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid and the Linda Lindas.\n\nYou can see the set list and video from the show below.\n\nThe pop-punk veterans opened with Saviors lead single \"The American Dream Is Killing Me\" before barreling through their breakthrough 1994 album Dookie in full. A handful of other hits and Saviors cuts followed before the band played its second full album of the night, 2004's American Idiot. The show ended with Billie Joe Armstrong delivering a solo acoustic performance of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).\"\n\nREAD MORE: Why Green Day Initially Shelved 'Good Riddance'\n\nHow 'Saviors' Connects to Green Day's Biggest Albums\n\nThere are several reasons behind Green Day's decision to play Dookie and American Idiot in full on the Saviors tour. Besides being the two biggest albums of the band's career, Armstrong said they also form a trifecta with their most recent release.\n\n\"In the beginning, I kept changing my mind about what I wanted the record to be,\" he told Vulture in January. \"Did I want it to be an old-school Green Day punk record, or did I want to do something that felt more lush and stadium-like? ... We had a large batch of songs that we recorded in London and when we saw it come together, I remembered thinking, 'Oh, this is the connection.' Saviors does feel like a trifecta with Dookie and American Idiot where it feels like a life's work. I went from not knowing what the hell I was doing to going, 'Oh gosh, we managed to bridge the gap between those two huge albums.'\"\n\nREAD MORE: Top 30 Albums of 1994\n\nThe Saviors tour continues on Thursday in Toronto, and the North American leg will extend through late September.
