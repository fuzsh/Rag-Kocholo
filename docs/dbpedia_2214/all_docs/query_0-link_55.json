off the coast of the South American mainland it was once part of, the twin-island republic of Trinidad and Tobago is one of the Caribbean’s most diverse and underexplored destinations. Best known as the home and heart of West Indian Carnival and the place where calypso, soca and steel pan were invented, T&T is a cultural pacemaker for the eastern Caribbean. The islands’ spectacular forests, savannahs and reefs harbour a huge array of animal, plant and birdlife, and the endless undeveloped beaches are some of the prettiest in the region, from palm-lined white sand fringed by limpid waters to secluded, wave-whipped outcrops.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago are well suited to independent travellers without being fully ﬂedged resorts, and because gas and oil (rather than tourism) are the main economic earners, both islands remain largely unfettered by the more noxious elements of Caribbean tourism. Visitors are not corralled in all-inclusives or holed-up on private swathes of sand, and the beaches are enjoyed by both local and foreign holidaymakers. Sun and sea are by no means the only draw here, however: no other Caribbean location offers such a variety of wildlife and habitats in so compact an area (Trinidad covers less than 5000 square kilometres, Tobago just 300). In Trinidad, there are tropical rainforests of mahogany and teak patrolled by howler monkeys and ocelots, wetlands harbouring manatees and anacondas, and remote beaches where giant leatherback turtles lay their eggs, while Tobago is best known for its stunning coral reefs, favoured by manta rays and shoals of brightly coloured tropical ﬁsh – and both islands have plenty of lovely waterfalls in which to beat the heat. And with more than 430 brilliantly hued species recorded here (one of the richest concentrations per square kilometre in the world), T&T also offer some brilliant opportunities for birdwatching.\n\nFact file • Standing at about 1.3 million, Trinidad and Tobago’s population is around 40 percent Indian, 39 percent black, 18.4 percent mixedrace, 0.6 percent white and 0.4 percent Chinese. • With 26 percent of its population Roman Catholic, 24.6 percent Protestant, 22.5 percent Hindu, 5.8 percent Muslim, 3.3 percent Presbyterian and 5.6 percent adhered to African-based religions such as Spiritual Baptist and Orisha, T&T is the Caribbean’s most theologically diverse nation.\n\n| INTRODUCTION | WHE RE TO GO | W HE N TO GO\n\nThe crowded and dynamic towns and cities are equally engaging, with fretworked “gingerbread” homes sitting side by side with temples, mosques, Catholic cathedrals and Anglican churches. The many ethnic groups brought to labour in the islands after the slaves were freed in 1834 have given rise to a remarkably varied populace, hailing from India, China, Portugal and Syria as well as Africa, England, France and Spain. Though racial tensions are inevitably present, Trinbagonians (as they’re collectively known) generally coexist with good humour, and are proud of the multiculturalism that has so enriched the life of the nation. This easy-going mentality is best expressed in the local propensity for liming – taking time out to meet friends and talk, usually over a beer or glass of rum.\n\n• The islands boast one of the highest literacy rates in the Western Hemisphere, at 99 percent.\n\nNorthern Range forest, Trinidad\n\n• The Trinidad and Tobago economy is the most diversiﬁed and industrialized in the English-speaking Caribbean. As well as exporting fruit, vegetables, sugar cane and manufactured goods, T&T produces an average of 154,000 barrels of oil and 115.2 million cubic metres of natural gas each year. • The Pitch Lake, at La Brea on Trinidad’s southwestern coast, is the world’s largest natural reservoir of asphalt. • As the southernmost islands in the Caribbean chain, T&T lie outside the region’s hurricane belt, and haven’t suffered a big blast since Flora in 1963. The islands are susceptible to earthquakes, however, with minor tremors occurring at an average of one a month.\n\n7\n\n| INTRODUCTION | WHE RE TO GO | W HE N TO GO\n\nFeeding off from the party-hard ethic is an electrifying music scene that rivals even that of Jamaica. T&T is the birthplace of calypso and the more fastpaced soca, as well as that quintessential sound of the Caribbean, the steel pan; you’ll hear plenty of all three year-round, but especially during the republic’s most famous party, its annual pre-Lenten Carnival. During this unique and explosive event, the no-holds-barred debauchery of opening night Jouvert celebrations is followed by two days of pure joy as 5000-strong bands of intricately costumed revellers take to the streets in a celebration of life.\n\nWhere to go ound together for the convenience of the British empire, Trinidad and Tobago are vastly different places. Trinidad offers culture, ethnic diversity, music, clubs, great food, pristine rainforest and a wealth of undeveloped beaches. Tobago is more of a conventional Caribbean resort, with busy strips of white sand and hotels of every stripe, as well as plenty of bars, restaurants and places to dance under the stars. It’s impossible to get a full picture of T&T without visiting both islands, but regular and inexpensive plane and ferry services between the two make it easy to see the best of each even during a short stay.\n\nB\n\nSunday School\n\n8\n\n| INTRODUCTION | WHE RE TO GO | W HE N TO GO\n\nA visit to Trinidad will inevitably begin in Port of Spain, the vibrant capital which, with its restaurants, nightlife and accommodation, is a natural base from which to explore the rest of the country. To the west, Chaguaramas is the capital’s playground as well as the jumpingoff point for boat trips to the rocky, wooded islands of the Bocas. A sweeping curve of powdery sand and powerful waves, Maracas Bay is the ﬁrst of many lovely beaches along the north coast, some reachable by road, others only on foot. Inland, the densely forested peaks of the Northern Range offer excellent hiking and birdwatching opportunities. South Beach vendor, Maracas Bay, Trinidad of the hills, the traffic-choked Eastern Main Road links the capital with the sizeable town of Arima, and provides access to swimmable rivers and waterfalls, caves, and the oldest Benedictine monastery in the Caribbean. The ﬂat agricultural plains of central Trinidad provide a fascinating contrast to the north; from the ethereal Waterloo Temple to the busy market town of Chaguanas, Indian culture predominates here, but there’s plenty of natural allure, from the scarlet ibis that inhabit the mangrove labyrinth of Caroni Swamp to the protected wetlands at Nariva, while endless swathes of ﬁne brown sand lined by groves of coconut palms make Manzanilla and Mayaro Bay favourite spots for some beachtime. The burgeoning city of San Fernando is a friendly base from which to explore the largely unvisited “deep south”, where modern oil towns such as Fyzabad contrast with the picturesque ﬁshing villages of Cedros and Erin. Most people travelling to Tobago head for the translucent waters, coral reefs and excellent facilities around Crown Point on the low-lying southwestern tip. The vibrant capital, Scarborough, with its market and historic fort, offers a more genuine picture of local life, while the rugged windward (or Atlantic) coast is best known for the spectacular waterfall at Argyll and the island’s best scuba diving at Speyside. The leeward or Caribbean coast promises some superb beaches, from the twin bays at Castara to the palm-lined swathe of Englishman’s Bay, while on the northeast tip, the absurdly pretty village of Charlotteville has the sublime Pirate’s Bay.\n\n9\n\nCastara from the Northside Road, Tobago\n\n| INTRODUCTION | WHE RE TO GO | W HE N TO GO\n\nWhen to go hough T&T’s temperatures remain tropical year-round, most people visit between January and March, when Carnival explodes into life, the trees are in bloom and the climate is at its most forgiving – the sun shines, rain is rare and the nights are cool. By May, the lack of rain has parched the formerly lush landscape: greens turn to yellow, dust clouds put the views into soft focus and bush ﬁres rage through the hills. Around the end of May, the rainy season begins, and the skies open up with dramatic deluges that can last all day. The wet season lasts until November, but there’s usually a respite from the downpours in September, a period of hot sunshine and blue skies known as the petit carem. It’s an excellent time to visit, with ﬂights at low season rates, though you’ll ﬁnd the resorts a little quiet. Some Tobago hoteliers raise rates during the high season (Dec 15–April 15), but many smaller hotels charge the same year-round in both islands. During Carnival week, however, all Port of Spain hotels and guesthouses boost their rates.\n\nT\n\nAverage temperatures and rainfall in Port of Spain Jan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay Jun\n\nJul\n\nAug Sep\n\nOct\n\nNov Dec\n\nAverage daily temperature Max/min (ºC) 31/21 31/20 32/20 32/21 32/22 32/22 31/22 31/22 32/22 32/22 32/22 31/21 Max/min (ºF) 87/69 88/68 89/68 90/69 90/71 89/71 88/71 88/71 89/71 89/71 89/71 88/69 Average rainfall mm 10\n\n69\n\n41\n\n46\n\n53\n\n94\n\n193\n\n218\n\n246\n\n193\n\n170\n\n183\n\n125\n\nthings not to miss\n\nIt’s not possible to see everything that Trinidad and Tobago have to offer in one trip – and we don’t suggest you try.

There are legions of specialist companies (see p.20) who can arrange these, often at a lower rate than you’d get booking ﬂight and accommodation independently. As Trinidad is less geared towards tourists, there are fewer deals available beyond birdwatching or Carnival packages, though Tobagooriented companies also often offer a few days in Trinidad. Visiting Trinidad and Tobago is also possible in conjunction with a trip to another Caribbean island or the South/Central American mainland. Liat (Wwww.liat.com) offers the widest range of inter-island ﬂights, while Copa (W www.copaair.com) has a twice-weekly service to Panama, and T&T’s national carrier Caribbean Airlines offers regular services to Venezuela and Guyana.\n\nFlights from the USA and Canada American Airlines operate twice-daily non-stop ﬂights from Miami to Port of Spain, Trinidad, with connections from New York (LGA) and Washington. If your ﬁnal destination is Tobago, try to get on the earlier ﬂight unless you want to spend a night in Port of Spain, as the later one gets in after the departure of the ﬁnal Trinidad–Tobago domestic service. Continental ﬂies daily non stop to Port of Spain from Houston, and daily via Houston from Newark; while Delta ﬂies four times a week to Port of Spain from Atlanta. Caribbean Airlines, which replaced BWIA as the national airline, advertises several routes: daily from Miami to Tobago (though you change planes in Trinidad and\n\n| Getting there\n\nThe number of ﬂights to Trinidad and Tobago has increased with the islands’ popularity. Even if your ﬁnal destination is Trinidad, it’s worth considering a ﬂight to Tobago followed by the inexpensive twenty-minute hop on a domestic plane over the Gulf of Paria. There’s more choice in terms of operators to Tobago, and prices can be a lot lower. Fares peak during the winter high season (Dec–March) and before and after Carnival (see p.35), and also rise a little during the summer school holidays.\n\nBASICS\n\nGetting there\n\nhave to recheck luggage), as well as regular services from Toronto, New York and Fort Lauderdale to Port of Spain. There are also charter ﬂights with Travelspan, who offer occasional packages to Port of Spain from New York. High-season fares from Miami average at around US$550; low-season fares are around US$100 less. Add around US$100 if you’re connecting from other US cities or ﬂying direct from Atlanta. From Canada, you’ll pay around Can$740 in low season, Can$1200 in high season.\n\nFlights from the UK and Ireland Most ﬂights from Britain to T&T go into Tobago, though if you’re headed for Trinidad it’s simple to hop on a Tobago Express domestic ﬂight from there (see p.25). British Airways ﬂy from Gatwick to Tobago twice or three times weekly depending on the season. Virgin Atlantic ﬂy twice a week from Gatwick to Tobago, while charter operator Monarch currently ﬂies from Gatwick to Tobago via Grenada on Wednesdays, returning direct the same day. National carrier Caribbean Airlines as well as British Airways operate two or three ﬂights per week to Port of Spain and Crown Point (Tobago) via St Lucia, Antigua, or Barbados. Note that there are no ﬂights to T&T from Ireland: the best option is to take a budget ﬂight to London or the US and then onward with one of the operators listed above. Fares with British Airways, Virgin, or Caribbean Airlines start at around £650 yearround, with a further hike around Carnival, though occasional deals do see discounts.\n\n19\n\nSix steps to a better kind of travel BASICS\n\n| Getting there\n\nAt Rough Guides we are passionately committed to travel. We feel strongly that only through travelling do we truly come to understand the world we live in and the people we share it with – plus tourism has brought a great deal of beneﬁt to developing economies around the world over the last few decades. But the extraordinary growth in tourism has also damaged some places irreparably, and of course climate change is exacerbated by most forms of transport, especially ﬂying. This means that now more than ever it’s important to travel thoughtfully and responsibly, with respect for the cultures you’re visiting – not only to derive the most beneﬁt from your trip but also to preserve the best bits of the planet for everyone to enjoy. At Rough Guides we feel there are six main areas in which you can make a difference: • Consider what you’re contributing to the local economy, and how much the services you use do the same, whether it’s through employing local workers and guides or sourcing locally grown produce and local services. • Consider the environment on holiday as well as at home. Water is scarce in many developing destinations, and the biodiversity of local ﬂora and fauna can be adversely affected by tourism. Try to patronize businesses that take account of this. • Travel with a purpose, not just to tick off experiences. Consider spending longer in a place, and getting to know it and its people. • Give thought to how often you ﬂy. Try to avoid short hops by air and more harmful night ﬂights. • Consider alternatives to ﬂying, travelling instead by bus, train, boat and even by bike or on foot where possible. • Make your trips “climate neutral” via a reputable carbon offset scheme. All Rough Guide ﬂights are offset, and every year we donate money to a variety of charities devoted to combating the effects of climate change.\n\nCharter services (currently Monarch) offer by far the cheapest fares, from around £300 low season to £500 high season, though offers can bring prices down to as low as £250 throughout the year. Bear in mind that these planes are cramped, and you have to pay an additional fee for prebooked seating (to ensure your party sits together).\n\nFlights from Australia and New Zealand\n\n20\n\nThe Caribbean is no bargain destination from Australia or New Zealand. There are no direct ﬂights to Trinidad and Tobago, so you’ll have to ﬂy to one of the main US gateway airports, and pick up onward connections from there. Air New Zealand, United and Qantas have regular services from major cities in Australia and New Zealand to Los Angeles, with connecting ﬂights to New York or Miami on American Airlines or United: return fares start at around Aus$3200 or NZ$2000.\n\nAirlines, agents and operators\n\nAirlines Air Canada Wwww.aircanada.com.

Buses, maxi taxis and route taxis serve most places mentioned in the Guide, though a few of the more rural areas are only accessible with your own transportation. Though public transport runs all night (albeit infrequently) in Port of Spain and San Fernando, having your own wheels is useful if you’re going out late, and private taxis are always available. Avoid travelling at peak hours (6–8am & 3–6pm), when urban roads are clogged and maxis and taxis heave with people. There is a water-taxi service available between San Fernando and Port of Spain – a much more relaxed route than along Trinidad’s busy roads.\n\nBy bus and maxi taxi\n\n22\n\nBus services in Trinidad and Tobago are divided between large public buses (run by the Public Transport Service Corporation, PTSC; Wwww.ptsc.co.tt) and private services (most often minibuses) called maxi taxis – both are viable transport options for the independent traveller, though maxi and route taxis (see below) are most practical. Buses and maxis between Port of Spain and Arima are especially quick due to the Priority Bus Route, which runs along the course of the old railway line through Trinidad’s east–west corridor. There are several types of public bus (Mon– Fri 6am–9pm, Sat 7am–7pm) in Trinidad, with both urban and national services: bear in mind that the “Super Express” blue transit bus is in fact the slowest and often most crowded option, with no air conditioning or music, whereas others are quicker and run every 10–15 minutes at peak times (7–8am, 4–6pm), and every 20 minutes off-peak, while also playing music and offering air conditioning. Bus stops are often small concrete shelters on the side of the road, or sometimes just a sign on a telephone pole. Tickets must be bought in advance, either from the main terminus in Port of Spain, the Scarborough bus terminal or from small general stores around the country – you cannot simply board a bus and buy your fare. Weekly and monthly tickets are available. Maxi taxis carry anything from ten to thirty people, and are privately owned but formed\n\ninto associations with set routes and fares; each area has a different colour-coded stripe. In Trinidad, yellow-striped vehicles work from in and around Port of Spain to the western tip; red stripes in the east; green stripes in the centre and south; black stripes in and around Princes Town; and brown stripes from San Fernando to the southwest. Blue-striped maxis operate in Tobago and there is only one set route, from Scarborough to Charlotteville (the rest are for schoolchildren and private tourist charters). Maxis adhere to no ﬁxed timetable, though more operate at busy periods (every 5min from 6–10am & 3–8pm), and after 8pm you can expect a longer wait. Some maxis run intermittently through the night, serving fetes and concerts, and the major towns. Importantly, maxis can be hailed anywhere along their route – just stick out your hand and if they have space they will pick you up – but it’s often quicker to go to the main stand; since maxis wait until they are full before leaving, they may not have free seats until they reach their destination. Once aboard, they will let you off at any point; press the buzzers by the windows to stop the bus. Fares range between TT$4 and TT$10; ask fellow passengers if you’re not sure, or just give the driver a TT$10 note and wait for your change. All public buses and most maxi taxis in Trinidad leave from and terminate at City Gate – sometimes referred to as South Quay in ofﬁcial literature – in Port of Spain, the\n\nRoute taxis follow similar rules to maxis, but they rarely have a main meeting point, with stands scattered around the towns and\n\n| Getting around\n\nBy route taxi and private taxi\n\ncities. They can hold four to ﬁve passengers in addition to the driver and, apart from their H number plates, they are indistinguishable from private cars (which have P number plates – although note that some P-licensed cars also operate as route taxis and are best avoided, as you could be getting into anyone’s car), and come in various states of repair. Route taxis don’t leave their stand until they’re full, but are usually quicker (and slightly more expensive) than maxis as they stop less frequently. To stop a taxi en route, hail it with your hand. There is a widely accepted code of hand signals; point left or right to indicate which direction you want to take at the next major turn-off. When entering the car it is normal to greet other passengers with a “good morning” or a “good afternoon”. To stop the taxi tell your driver you want to get off as you approach your destination – in Trini-speak, “nex corner drive”. As with maxis, if you’re not sure what you should be paying, just hand over a TT$10 note and wait for change. Like anywhere, private taxis take you directly to your destination, but are unmetered, so a price must be agreed beforehand, and they easily work out just as expensive as a cab in Britain or the US. As with route taxis, they also have an H number plate. It is often possible – and more economical – however, to bargain with a route taxi driver to drop you where you want. Phone-ATaxi (T628 TAXI) offers the cheapest 24-hour, islandwide service in Trinidad.\n\nBASICS\n\ncountry’s main transportation hub. Examples of fares from Port of Spain are TT$5 to Arima or TT$7 to San Fernando on Transit buses; other services are a bit more expensive. In Tobago, all buses leave from the Greenside Street terminal in Scarborough; most are blue-striped minibuses and operate more frequently during peak hours. Ofﬁcially buses run from Scarborough to Crown Point (TT$3), Castara (TT$6) and Charlotteville (TT$9). Information on public bus services in Trinidad can be obtained from the Customer Care Centre in City Gate, or by ringing T623 2341; in Tobago, call T 639 2293. Riding in a maxi can be an entertaining experience; interiors often reﬂect the taste of the owner, declaring anything from religious faith to a devotion to love and money, with more ornate vehicles having padded ceilings or photos of favourite personalities. Many have a slogan across their windscreen: the nickname of the driver, perhaps, or their personal motto, like “Young Adult” or “Black Man Redemption”. In the past maxis were famed for being sort of travelling discos, but a law – passed to assuage worries that children were grooving aboard their favourite “party maxi” after school – now requires drivers to pay for a licence if they wish to play music in their vehicles (few do).\n\nPTSC “Know Your Country” Tours In addition to standard bus services, PTSC offers tours to some of Trinidad’s most popular attractions. The “Know Your Country Tours” are designed primarily for locals (though tourists are welcome), and are an excellent and very cheap way of getting to some of the more inaccessible parts of the island (entrance fees and meals are your responsibility). Current tours are as follows: departing from City Gate in Port of Spain, there’s a visit to Los Iros (stopping at Penal and the Divina Pastora church in Siparia), Blanchisseuse (stopping at the Asa Wright Nature Centre and passing through Morne La Croix and Brasso Seco, and with a swimming stop at Las Cuevas), Mayaro (stopping at Manzanilla Beach) and the Pitch Lake (stopping at Vessigny and Granville beaches). Starting from the PTSC terminus in San Fernando (though you could pick it up in the capital), there’s also a tour to Port of Spain, taking in the National Museum and heading on to Maracas beach. Tour prices range from TT$50 to TT$100 per person. For more information, call T624 9839.\n\n23\n\nBy rental vehicle\n\nBASICS\n\n| 24\n\nDriving in T&T requires patience and constant alertness; you simply cannot take your eyes off the road for one moment, and the packed streets of downtown Port of Spain with their complicated one-way systems can be a nightmare. Throughout the islands, drivers (particularly those of maxis and taxis) habitually stop at short notice, turn without indicating and happily block trafﬁc to chat with a friend. The best thing to do is accept it; beeping your horn out of irritation will only get you withering stares; horns are more frequently used as a thank-you gesture and as an indication of an intention to overtake. Expect maxis/taxis to pull over at any moment, and always drive defensively. Trinbagonian drivers are generally courteous, especially when confronted with a rental car, often stopping to allow you to pull out or by shouting advice. Some, however, take to the road at night with only one headlight/taillight, and being dazzled by full-beam headlights is common; keep your eyes to the left verge to avoiding staring into the lights. Hand signals are also frequently used: an up-and-down movement indicates that a driver is about to stop (or an instruction for others to stop due to a hazard ahead); if you’re pulling out into trafﬁc, it’s also usual to stick your arm out to indicate your intent. Whatever the motivation, slow down if faced with a hand signal. Driving on main highways can feel hair-raising – a favourite Trinbagonian habit is a high-speed weaving technique which looks as though it ought to cause a multiple pile-up (sadly, it often does so); take extra care, especially in the tropical rains. Trafﬁc lights can be confusing; there are usually three, relating to relevant lanes; left, straight on, and right. You’ll also see ﬂashing red or yellow lights at major junctions; both mean “proceed with caution”; yellow means it’s primarily your right of way, red that it’s someone else’s. Seat belts are compulsory, but not always used. Drinking and driving is also illegal, though the attitude towards it is more laid back in T&T than most other countries. The law also demands that drivers be properly attired; it’s possible to be charged for “driving\n\nbareback”, so always keep a T-shirt handy. Road signs are based on the English system (although distances and speed limits are in kilometres), and you must drive on the left. The speed limit is 80kmph on highways and 55kmph on main roads in built-up areas. Tobago’s speed limit is 50kmph. A valid international driving licence or one issued in the US, Canada, UK, Germany or the Bahamas is required for driving both cars and motorcycles for up to ninety days. Apply to the Licensing Division on Wrightson Road, Port of Spain (T625 1031), if you intend to drive in T&T for longer than three months.\n\nCar rental All companies require you to be 25 or over and hold a valid driving licence; most ask for a deposit guaranteed by a credit card imprint, though some smaller ﬁrms, especially in Tobago, accept a cash deposit of around US$170. You’ll be offered a collision damage waiver at extra cost (usually US$5–15 per day); without one, you will be liable for damage. Prices vary, so shop around; they tend to start at around US$30 per day for the smallest vehicle, inclusive of third-party insurance and unlimited mileage. Check tyres (including the spare) before you drive away, and make sure you’re present when existing scratches and bumps are marked.\n\nCar rental ﬁrms Auto Rentals Trinidad Wwww.autorentalstt.com.

Rentals plus tours.\n\nBy water taxi between Port of Spain and San Fernando The island’s brand new water taxi service saves on time and stress on the roads between Trinidad’s two main cities, ideal if you want to explore the south. The journey takes 45 minutes, costs TT$15, and operates hourly in the early mornings and afternoons from the cruise ship complex on Wrightson Road in Port of Spain (next to the Breakfast Shed) to Flat Rock, Lady Hales Avenue in San Fernando. Tickets can be bought before travel or in advance (recommended for rush hour journeys). Call T 624 3281 or 657 5434 for more details.\n\nTravelling between Trinidad and Tobago There are two options available if you wish to travel between the islands – the plane, quick and relatively inexpensive; and the ferry, a bit slower and a lot cheaper. It’s easier to go by air, though transport from Port of Spain to Piarco airport can be expensive, and if you have spare time, the evening sea crossing is often a romantic starlit experience.\n\nFast catamarans T&T Spirit and T&T Express make the journey between the islands in around three hours. In Trinidad, ferries arrive and depart from the new Government Shipping Passenger Service opposite the Twin Towers on Wrightson Road in Port of Spain; in Tobago, the terminus is in Scarborough. There are usually around six sailings per day, but it’s best to call in advance or check the Port Authority’s website, Wwww.patnt.com, which lists current sailings. Bear in mind that the journey can be rough due to strong currents in the Bocas; take sea-sickness tablets. One-way tickets cost TT$50; standard car prices are TT$150 one-way. Note that you can’t book seats or buy tickets on the phone or online. For same-day tickets only, the Government Shipping Passenger Service ticket ofﬁce in Port of Spain is open Monday to Thursday 7.15am to 3pm, 4.15 to 6pm & 7 to 10.30pm, Friday 7.15am to 3pm; be prepared to join the queue at least three hours before the boat leaves – or else buy in advance (essential for busy periods like Carnival, Easter or Great Race) from travel agencies – check the website. In Scarborough, Tobago, you can buy tickets at the ferry terminal on Carrington Street. For further information, call T625 4906 in Trinidad, T639 2416 in Tobago.\n\n| Getting around\n\nMotorcycles\n\nBy ferry\n\nBASICS\n\nand unpredictable driving, but a bike can be a good way of getting around Tobago’s quieter roads. You can rent bicycles on both islands, though for the same reason they’re not great for getting around Trinidad, except for exploring quiet areas such as Tucker Valley in Chaguaramas.\n\nBy plane National carrier Caribbean Airlines (T625 7200, Wwww.caribbean-airlines.com) makes the twenty-minute ﬂight between Trinidad and Tobago fourteen times a day. Tickets cost from TT$160 one way and TT$300 return; you can book online or make a reservation by phone, which is held for 24 hours – you’ll lose it unless you purchase your ticket in person. In Trinidad, there are ofﬁces at Piarco Airport, and at Nicholas Towers, Independence Square, Port of Spain; in Tobago, there’s an ofﬁce opposite departures in Crown Point Airport. Note that once you’ve paid, you can change the date and time of your ﬂight on the phone or in person at the ofﬁces. 25\n\nBASICS\n\n| 26\n\nAccommodation There is no shortage of places to stay in Trinidad and Tobago, despite them not being the most tourist-oriented islands in the Caribbean. Tobago has numerous luxury resorts, cosy guesthouses and private villas – especially in the Crown Point area. In Trinidad, there is plenty of accommodation in Port of Spain – owing mostly to the annual Carnival invasion and business travellers – as well as guesthouses and hotels near most of the better beaches along the north coast. Trinidad’s centre and south is less promising; with the exception of Mayaro Bay in the southeast, most options are expensive and cater to oil workers. Accommodation in T&T is cheaper than you might expect for a Caribbean destination – ranging from as little as US$30 (£20) per night for a basic room with a fan in Port of Spain to US$50–80 (£30–55) for an air-conditioned unit with cable TV – but it’s still likely to be your major expense. Rates at most places in Trinidad change only at Carnival time, but properties in Tobago have two rates; one for the summer low season (mid-April to mid-Dec) and another for the winter high season (mid-Dec to mid-April). Many local hoteliers are open to a bit of haggling, however, particularly in summer, and if you plan to stay for more than two weeks. Trinbagonians always get rooms at a lower rate; this is normal practice, ensuring that resorts get a mix of local people and tourists. There are a couple of hidden extras to watch out for: room tax (ten percent) and service charge (ten percent) are added to quoted room rates at more expensive hotels, though not at guesthouses. Throughout the Guide, we have taken tax and service charges into account, but it’s worth checking whether these charges have been included each time you rent a room. Though it’s advisable to book ahead during the busy times of Carnival (see box, p.66) – and Easter on Tobago – at other times you should have no problem ﬁnding suitable accommodation once you’ve arrived; staff at TDC desks at Piarco and Crown Point airports (see p.62 & p.206) can direct you to a place that suits your plans and budget, and many hotels in Tobago offer free airport pick-ups.\n\nOn Tobago, choosing your location can be tricky. The upmarket touristy areas between Buccoo and Plymouth keep prices relatively high here; you pay less for the same standard of room in more remote areas. The location does make one of the most attractive bases, however, being close to the action of Crown Point without being stuck right in it; transport is easy (taxis run along Shirvan Road from early morning to late at night), and the beaches are marvellous. Also close to Crown Point and with easy transport links, Lambeau, Little Rockly Bay and Lowlands are home to a growing number of options at a range of prices, while nearby Scarborough and its suburb of Bacolet is the place to ﬁnd both ﬁrst-class romantic hotels and inexpensive host homes. Elsewhere, there is an abundance of cheaper accommodation, often with some of the most stunning locations Tobago has to offer. The gorgeous and friendly ﬁshing centres of Castara and Charlotteville, for example, are growing in popularity among those wishing to get away from it all, each with an increasing number of moderately priced places to stay. Bear in mind that there are no proper campsites in T&T, though camping is a popular activity for Trinidadians during holiday weekends and some hiking groups and guides (see p.40) offer bush camps as one of their options.\n\nHotels Most of T&T’s resort-type hotels cluster around Tobago’s better beaches, such as along the coast between Buccoo and\n\nA welcome feature of the islands’ accommodation choices for the budget-minded visitor is the myriad small guesthouses. These are often great value for money and friendly\n\n| Accommodation\n\nGuesthouses, host homes and bed & breakfasts\n\nBASICS\n\nPlymouth, where you’ll ﬁnd expansive, landscaped enclaves with private beaches, as well as “eco-hotels” and holistic havens. In between these are no-nonsense concrete blocks dedicated to the needs of the package tourist, and legions of eightto-twelve-room properties with pastel decor, loud bedspreads and a pool. Thankfully, the all-inclusive trend that’s swept through the rest of the Caribbean has not yet caught on here. Though some larger properties offer all-inclusive plans, you can also stay on a room-only basis. You may be offered the option of a “meal plan” – the most common are CP (Continental; room and breakfast), MAP (Modiﬁed American; room, breakfast and dinner) or FAP (Full American; room and all meals including snacks and tea). In both islands, large-scale hotels meet international standards in terms of facilities: air conditioning, TV (usually cable or satellite), telephone, wireless internet access (or in-room jacks), private bathroom with hot water and maybe a balcony, as well as restaurants, bars and sometimes a pool on site. However, most of the smarter Trinidad hotels cater largely to business travellers, so you won’t ﬁnd much in the way of organized entertainment or a holiday atmosphere – something which you’ll ﬁnd in abundance in Tobago.\n\nplaces to stay. It is not compulsory for any guesthouse to be registered with the tourist board and many perfectly good ones are not; however, if they are it means that they have been inspected and approved. Being anything from a couple of rooms tacked on to a private home or a smoothly run nine-room establishment, guesthouses generally have less facilities than at hotels; many don’t have a pool, and you could get a fan instead of air conditioning. There may also be no hot water, a shared bathroom, homelier decor and more of a personal touch. Prices at more basic options are\n\nAccommodation price codes All accommodation listed in this guide has been graded according to the following price categories: 1 US$20 and under 2 US$21–45 3 US$46–80\n\n4 US$81–110 5 US$111–140 6 US$141–170\n\n7 US$171–200 8 US$201–250 9 US$251 and over\n\nRates are for the cheapest double or twin rooms, including ten-percent tax and ten-percent service charge where applicable. In Tobago, rates quoted are those used during the high season, mid-December to mid-April (low season rates fall by up to 25 percent). There is no high season in Trinidad, but rates may double during Carnival. Payment can be made in either US or TT currency.\n\n27\n\nBASICS\n\n| Food and drink\n\nlower than at hotels, though more upmarket ones often cost as much. Budget-minded travellers should note that many guesthouse (and even hotel) rooms include a kitchen or kitchenette (the latter consisting of a hot plate, fridge and sometimes a microwave) for roughly the same rate as a standard room. Most provide utensils; make sure that an inventory is taken in your presence to ensure that you are not held liable for breakages that occurred before you arrived. Private host homes and bed & breakfasts are inexpensive and generally excellent; neither charge room tax or VAT, and you may get more insight into local lifestyles and attitudes than you’d experience elsewhere. Both host homes and B&Bs are monitored and inspected by the Tourism Development Company (TDC), which also produces a list of registered establishments (see Wwww .visittnt.com). What you get for your money varies enormously; some offer air conditioning and private hot-water bathroom, whereas others are much more basic. These options normally rent for upwards of US$35 per room, though owners are often open to a bit of bargaining. In Trinidad, more options are available from the Trinidad and Tobago Bed and Breakfast Co-operative, T663 4413, [email protected]; in Tobago, contact Ms Miriam Edwards on T639 3926.\n\nVillas, beach houses and long-term rentals Most holiday villas rented to tourists are in Tobago and tend to have full staff and facilities such as a kitchen and pool. These options can actually be quite cost-effective if you’re travelling in a group; plan on paying US$280 per week for the most basic villa to as much as US$4000 for something in the lap of luxury – those around the Mount Irvine golf course, for example. Most are privately owned but represented by agencies; in Tobago, contact Island Investments, 30 Shirvan Rd, Scarborough (T639 0929, Wislreal.com). You can also check the TDC website Wwww.visittnt.com, or in the UK contact The Owners’ Syndicate (see p.21). In Trinidad, beach houses are available in areas such as Mayaro and the Toco coast – generally geared to locals on a weekend break (you may have to bring your own bed linen and so on) – though you can get some real bargains by scanning the local papers. If you are planning to stay in Trinidad for a month or more, consider a furnished apartment. Most are advertised in the classiﬁed pages of the Trinidad Guardian, with basic ones in Port of Spain starting at around US$280 per month. Ads for “tourist” or “vacation” accommodation often mean higher rates, though you’ll probably ultimately pay less than at a hotel.\n\nFood and drink A highlight of visiting Trinidad and Tobago is the chance to sample the islands’ fantastic cuisine, a unique and addictive blend of African, Indian, Chinese, European and Latin American inﬂuences. It’s hard to overemphasize the centrality of food to Trinbagonian culture; a true Trinbagonian would never lime without a full stomach, and many leisure activities revolve around the preparation of food. It’s rare to visit a private home without being offered something to eat, and you may be regarded as rude if you refuse, though it’s not very likely that you’ll want to. 28\n\nTrinbagonian cuisine\n\ninsipid tourist fare, Trinbagonian cuisine\n\nAlthough T&T’s larger hotels and international-style restaurants often serve\n\nhasn’t been dumbed down for visitors like in most Caribbean resorts, and you’re much\n\n| Food and drink\n\nCreole cooking In T&T culinary terms, Creole refers to African-style cooking which has picked up many other inﬂuences along the way. Usually served with a slice of zaboca (avocado), pelau is a classically Creole chicken dish, utilizing the “browning down” tradition of caramelizing meat in nearly burnt brown sugar. Rice, pigeon peas, garlic, onions and vegetables are then added and cooked down in coconut milk to delicious effect. Browning is also used to make traditional Sunday baked chicken, usually accompanied by cheesy macaroni or potato pie and potato or green ﬁg (banana) salad. Another Creole staple is callaloo: chopped dasheen leaves cooked with okra, coconut milk and occasionally crab meat, into a tasty, pleasantly slimy mixture that’s sometimes pureed. It’s often served with coocoo, a kind of cornmeal polenta ﬂavoured with okra. Other Creole main meals, almost always backed up by a hearty rearguard of ground provisions (see “Fruit and vegetables”), include spicy oxtail (cow tails stewed with vegetables and butter beans or split peas), and curry goat (tender goat, and sometimes mutton, cooked in a curry sauce). Two dishes not for the squeamish are black pudding, a highly spiced pigs’ blood sausage, and souse, pigs’ or chickens’ feet marinated in lime juice and peppers. A\n\nclassic accompaniment to main meals is oil down: vegetables (particularly breadfruit or cassava) stewed in coconut milk. Though increasingly rare these days, “wild meat” such as agouti, lappe, manicou, tattoo and quenk are considered a huge delicacy, and end up in the pot where available; these days, the best place to taste it is in rural communities or at Tobago’s harvest festivals. If you see any of these on a menu, bear in mind that many of these animals are endangered and hunting is only permitted in season. Creole soups include corn soup (see p.32); san coche, a lentil soup cooked with pig tail; and cowheel soup, thick with split peas and slowly cooked meat. Fish broth is a thin and delicious fortifying ﬁsh soup padded out with boiled green bananas and dumplings, while pacro water is similar but substitutes pacro (a mollusc known as chip-chip in Trinidad) for ﬁsh. Reputed to be a strong aphrodisiac, it’s sometimes called “Man Water”. You’ll also see Cajun-style creamy seafood chowder on menus. Seafood in general is extremely popular; from thick steaks of dense and delicious kingﬁsh, shark, grouper, tuna, cavalli, carite, barracuda and dolphin (the ﬁsh also known as “dorado”, not the mammal), to smaller ﬁllets of “red ﬁsh”: moonshine, snapper, parrotﬁsh, ﬂying ﬁsh and tilapia. Creole-style ﬁsh is usually fried or stewed in a peppery tomato-based marinade of onion, sweet and hot peppers and garlic, while curry crab and dumplin’ (crab cooked in its shell with a coconut curry sauce and served with boiled dumplings) is a marvellous Tobago speciality. Local lobster is usually doused in a lemon, garlic or herb butter, or sometimes curried, while the slightly chewy and extremely nutritious conch (lambie) is curried, steamed, made into chowder, or, occasionally, marinated in lime and served raw in a ceviche salad.\n\nBASICS\n\nmore likely to be offered dishes from the vast array of local food. Due to the islands’ diverse heritage, “local” can mean anything from Indian curry and roti to Creole coocoo and oil down or Spanish and South American-style pastelles (Christmas cornﬂour patties ﬁlled with ground meat, olives and raisins, wrapped in a banana leaf). Cooks in T&T have a far lighter hand with hot peppers than you might expect, preferring the delicate ﬂavours of fresh herbs such as chives, thyme and the ubiquitous coriander-like chadon beni. Heat is usually added later at the table, in liberal dashes of ﬁery hot pepper sauce. If you don’t like things too hot, remember to say so when eating out, or your meal may be automatically smothered with pepper sauce. If you like things just a little spicy, ask for “slight pepper” when buying doubles, roti or other street foods.\n\nIndian cooking Though the obvious staple of IndoTrinidadian cooking is curry, the T&T version is somewhat different to that served in India, using fresh hot peppers rather than chilli paste and a blend of curry powder that’s peculiar to the islands. One of the most popular curry dishes is duck, which\n\n29\n\nBASICS\n\n| Food and drink\n\nforms the centrepiece of the ever-popular Trini tradition of a “curry duck lime”. Another mainstay is the vast array of chutneys, ranging from super-sweet to tart or peppery. Look out for sweetly curried mango on the seed, peppery anchar, subtly spicy tamarind chutney and kucheela, a hot mango pickle that’s universally plopped into rotis, doubles (see opposite) and aloo pies.\n\nRoti The unofﬁcial national dish, roti is made practically everywhere and eaten by just about everyone as a convenient lunch or evening snack. A stretchy ﬂat bread (“skin”) is used to wrap curried meat, vegetables or ﬁsh, a style of preparation that originated in Trinidad but is now popular across the Caribbean. There are several variations of roti skins including basic dhalpuri (with seasoned split peas layered into the dough), sada (cooked on a hot griddle, usually made in the early morning and served with fresh tomato “choka”) and bussup-shut, a thin, tasty shredded skin that resembles a torn cloth shirt and is used to spoon up mouthfuls of curry sold in “snackboxes”. Paratha or dosti is a plain roti skin. Roti ﬁllings range from curried chicken and beef to conch, goat and shrimp. Most vendors include meat on the bone – if you don’t fancy sucking out the marrow as the locals do, ask for “boneless”. Common vegetarian ﬁllings (also used to complement the meats) are channa (curried chickpeas) and potato, sweet pumpkin, bodi (green beans) and bhaji (spinach-like greens). In a restaurant, you may be offered a bowl of peppery lentil dhal as an accompaniment.\n\nFruit and vegetables\n\n30\n\nLocal fruit and vegetables are plentiful and cheap, particularly if you buy from large markets, where you’ll see unfamiliar fruits alongside the more recognizable items. Super-sweet and extremely popular, the sapodilla is grey-brown and globular with gritty, sweet pulp, while cherry-sized chenets have smooth green skin and a large seed with sweet, slightly acidic ﬂesh. The knobbly green and brown skin of the soursop surrounds a delectable milky white pulp, often made into ice cream or drinks; its smaller cousin the sweetsop is less common.\n\nLook out also for the sweet and scrumptious kymet, a round, deep purple fruit with seeds that form a star shape when the fruit is cut in half. The round pomme cythere (called pomsitae) is sweet and yellow when ripe, but is often eaten green with salt and pepper as “chow” – as is the star-shaped carambola (ﬁve ﬁnger) and unripe mango. Green-skinned with a soft, aromatic orange ﬂesh, pawpaw (papaya) is best eaten with a squeeze of fresh lime, while bananas (often called ﬁgs – look out for the tasty, tiny ﬁnger variety or young green bananas boiled and eaten as a savoury), watermelon and pineapples are all very common. Passion fruit (granadilla) and guava are often blended into drinks. Citrus is ever popular; you’ll see lemons, limes, and exceptionally sweet oranges and grapefruit, while portugals are easy-peel, thick-skinned mandarins. Many varieties of mango grow profusely in rural areas, perfuming whole communities with the distinctive aroma of rotting fruit from April till August. The most popular (and expensive) type is the rosy, medium-sized julie, while the long stringy mango is best avoided unless you have dental ﬂoss handy. The most frequent vegetables seen on the Creole dinner plate are blue food or ground provisions, including boiled root vegetables like yams, the chewy, purple-tinted dasheen, the softer, white-coloured eddoe and cassava as well as sweet potato and regular potatoes. Dasheen leaves are cooked up with okra (ladies’ ﬁngers) to make callaloo (see p.29). You’ll also see aubergine (locally called melongene), christophenes – pearshaped and light green with a bland, watery taste similar to marrow – pumpkin, green bodi string beans and breadfruit (pembois), green and thick-skinned with clothy white ﬂesh that can be baked, boiled or fried. Plantain is a popular accompaniment, a larger, denser member of the banana family; deliciously sweet when ripe, it’s usually served fried or boiled, or as plantain chips, a healthier alterative to potato crisps. Thanks to the Indian inﬂuence, pulses (referred to as peas) are widely used in the form of red lentil dhal; green lentils cooked with pumpkin and coconut; curried chickpeas (channa); and pigeon/gungo peas and black-eye peas cooked with rice and\n\ncoconut milk to make the Caribbean classic of rice and peas.\n\nmost popular breakfast on the go, however, is doubles (see below): vendors do a brisk trade from as early as 7am. Other popular breakfast breads include banana bread or fried bakes, non-yeast rolls of variable shape that are sometimes sweetened with grated coconut. If you don’t fancy eating heavily in the morning, most hotels offer a “continental” option of toast, juice, fruit and coffee or tea.\n\n| Food and drink\n\nA burgeoning restaurant culture is developing across Trinidad’s urban areas, from casual diners to world-class gourmet establishments, as well as some stylish places to enjoy Indian, Creole, Chinese and international cuisine. You’ll also ﬁnd a huge lunchtime variety in Port of Spain’s downtown shopping malls; no-nonsense eateries where decor and ambience come second to the food, which is invariably inexpensive and delicious: curries, roti, Chinese staples, macaroni pie and lentil peas, potato or green ﬁg salad, Creole-style ﬁsh, chicken and the ubiquitous pelau. In Tobago, you’ll see lots of variety in the restaurants, many of which are decidedly high-class, with prices to match (US$12–30 for a main course). Local seafood, curries, Creole sauces and roti do feature, but you’ll also encounter plenty of international dishes. With fewer ofﬁce workers and late-night revellers, street food is far less widely available, and the best places to sample typical Tobago dishes like crab and dumplin’ are the Blue Crab restaurant (see p.240) in Scarborough or the tiny cookshops in the market. In the southwest tip, it can be difﬁcult to escape the often bland tourist offerings; pasta or steak often take precedence over coocoo or conch, though it’s not impossible to ﬁnd good Tobagonian cooking. If you’re here in the slow season (mid-April to mid-Dec), bear in mind that many kitchens close at around 9pm. On both islands, breakfast is traditionally a hearty meal, ideally taken with a steaming mug of chocolate tea: fresh cocoa rolled into an oily ball with nutmeg, cinnamon and sugar, which is grated and mixed with condensed milk and water. Designed to stand you in good stead for a hard day’s work, breakfast may consist of smoked mackerel or herring cooked up with onions and peppers, fried ﬁsh or the classic semisalad buljol, an extremely tasty blend of soaked, boiled and ﬂaked saltﬁsh, fresh onions, tomatoes, lime juice and sweet peppers, usually eaten with avocado and a couple of light, airy rolls called hops; the\n\nThe addition of a tax (up to ﬁfteen percent) and service charge (usually ten percent) to your restaurant bill is standard, and is not usually included in prices given for individual dishes, making what seems a moderately priced meal considerably more expensive. If the service charge is included, you don’t need to leave a tip.\n\nBASICS\n\nEating out\n\nTax and tipping\n\nFast food and street food Though international fast-food chains are part of the scenery, local outlets still manage to draw the crowds; chicken chain Royal Castle is the local KFC equivalent, which uses a tasty blend of spices and herbs in the batter and also serves ﬂying-ﬁsh sandwiches and veggie burgers; there’s a delicious dollop of chadon beni-laced, not-too-hot pepper sauce on everything as well. Joe’s Pizza (Trinidad only) is a good option, and also delivers. However, Trinidad’s street food is by far the best option for a bite on the go, with everything from halal meat or ﬁsh sandwiches to fried chicken and, of course, roti; all vendors are subject to stringent hygiene checks; a clean bill provides an ofﬁcial badge, so eating on the hop rarely constitutes a health risk. You’re guaranteed to ﬁnd something tasty if you head for the vendors along Western Main Road in St James, Port of Spain – open day and night. Good roti shops abound in the capital (see p.93 for listings), but most locals agree that the best roti is to be found in the Indian heartlands of central or south Trinidad. The other popular Indian snack is doubles, two pieces of soft, fried bara\n\n31\n\nBASICS\n\n| Food and drink 32\n\nbread sandwiching a runny channa curry and spiced up with cucumber pepper sauce and kucheela mango chutney, and usually sold in the mornings from streetside stalls noticeable for their long queues and stripy umbrellas. Aloo (potato) pies are another popular snack, as are cheese, beef or ﬁsh pies sold from large wicker baskets in the streets or hole-in-the-wall shops. A little less substantial are the selection of seasoned breads such as the addictive pholouri (splitpea balls served with tart and tasty tamarind sauce) or sahina, a ground channa and dasheen leaf fritter. Port of Spain’s Savannah and most junctions along the Eastern Main Road are ﬂanked by vendors selling small local oysters. Said to revive ﬂagging libidos, they’re served in a cup with a peppery, vinegary tomato sauce. Creole street delicacies include corn soup, a thick and satisfying split-pea broth with vegetables, chunks of young sweetcorn and mini dumplings – a favourite hangover cure; pick a vendor with a queue as quality varies. Accra is a peppery salt ﬁsh fritter, while the ubiquitous shark ‘n’ bake is best consumed at Maracas Beach, where vendors compete to produce the tastiest version of this sandwich of a slab of shark meat, salads and delicious condiments such as garlic, tamarind or chadon beni sauce slapped between fried bread (the bake). Jamaican jerk chicken and pork – spiced up in a tasty pimento-based marinade and cooked over a wood ﬁre – is very popular, with stalls dotted all over Port of Spain; it’s often served with “festival”, a sweetish fried dumpling. Another popular choice is the food of Trinidadian Rastafarians, ital cooking, which (strictly speaking) refers to fresh vegetables, fruits and pulses prepared with no salt or additives. However, though Trini ital stalls haven’t managed to relinquish salt, the cooking remains extremely wholesome, with beautifully seasoned soya mince, black-eye peas, split peas, rice, macaroni pie and mixed vegetables served in a carton or in a roti skin; check the truck near to KFC in Independence Square, Port of Spain (Wed–Sat), or Chinkies Nite-Bite (Tues–Sun), opposite Smokey and Bunty in St James, or at the croisee in San Juan.\n\nDesserts and sweets With so much locally grown cane sugar and raw cocoa, it’s not surprising that there are plenty of desserts to choose from on both islands. Puds like paimie, a delectable coconut, cornmeal and pumpkin pudding boiled in a banana leaf (or plastic wrap) and pone, a wet cake made with cassava, and sometimes sweet potato, spiced with nutmeg, or the classic black cake – a ridiculously rich, rum-soaked Christmas speciality – are sublime. Home-made fruit ice cream, sold everywhere from street stalls, is particularly good, as is the Guinness-ﬂavoured variety. Sweets come in numerous varieties. In Tobago, look out for bene balls, toothcrunching globes of sesame seeds and sugar, and coconut cake, a slab of shredded coconut boiled in sugar syrup and pink food colouring. Tamarind balls take a little getting used to, combining the tart taste of tamarind with sugar and salt, as do salt prunes (seasoned, sweet-and-sour prunes rolled in a dusty red colouring, often dropped into white rum) and red mango, which is green mango, well seasoned with spices and sugar and doused in bright red colouring. Other candies include toolum, a sticky ball of grated coconut, molasses and ginger, pawpaw balls (shredded green papaya boiled in sweet syrup and rolled in sugar) and sugary fudge, while there are hundreds of often sickly sugared and fried Indian sweets; kurma (sweet fried dough balls) are probably the most popular.\n\nDrinking Given T&T’s capacity for consumption of beer, it’s hardly surprising the national brews go down smoothly. The market leader, Carib, is a light, golden lager, while its close competitor, Stag, is a little sweeter and marketed as “a man’s beer”. Both taste better drunk out of the bottle, and both are available on draught. Other local lagers like Samba, or Guyanese Polar, have yet to make much impact. Guinness is brewed in Trinidad but, though bitter and refreshing, it bears little similarity to versions elsewhere – a couple of places in Port of Spain do serve draught Guinness in cans. The sweeter Royal Extra or Mackeson stouts are excellent local alternatives.\n\n| Food and drink\n\nacceptable. Imported Jamaican coconut rum is a favourite tipple, and local Mokatika coffee liqueur is a worthy after-dinner drink, often mixed with milk. In terms of local soft drinks, there’s the energy-boosting Ginseng-Up; delicious Carib Shandy, in sorrel and ginger varieties; LLB, a mix of lime, lemon and bitters that makes a good mixer for spirits; and Bentley, a refreshing bitter lemon soda. There’s also Green Sands, a tasty shandy. The best thing for the heat, however, is mineral-packed fresh coconut water, sold in water or jelly varieties. Vendors – such as at Port of Spain’s Savannah – chop off the outer husk to expose a drinking hole (use a straw as the juice stains clothing), and then hack the nut in two so you can scoop out the delicious jelly. Made from boiled tree bark, cloves and aniseed, reddish-brown (sometimes yellow) mauby is wonderfully bitter, but an acquired taste. Other unusual drinks include tart, deep cerise sorrel, enjoyed at Christmas with a dash of rum, and the strong poncha crema, an eggnog boosted with plenty of rum. Sea moss, a white and glutinous preparation made from sea moss and milk, is widely believed to enhance sexual performance; other stamina-inducing potions are the “bomb”, a blended concoction of Guinness, nutmeg and condensed milk or a carton of Supligen energy drink. Cinnamon- and nutmeg-infused carrot juice and peanut punch, blended with condensed milk, are a meal in themselves, sold from stalls across the islands. Check Hardline Vegetarian and Mother Nature in Port of Spain (see p.92) for blended juice drinks; aside from wonderful ﬁg, pineapple or beetroot blends, they also sell channa, okra and male or female “sex” punches.\n\nBASICS\n\nBoth dark (or “red”) and white rum are downed with equal enthusiasm, the white tending to be less abrasively strong than the overproof brands of other islands; regular T&T rums are 43 percent alcohol. The most popular brands are Old Oak and Vat 19 white and gold rums, and Black Label red rum. Angostura Premium White is a little higher in quality; the best local rum is the delicious Angostura 1919, a dark, aged rum with lovely molasses undertones; Royal Oak is a less pricey and pretty tasty alternative. At 75 percent alcohol, puncheon rum is fully abrasive and mostly favoured by rheumy-eyed old men. Though it’s illegal to produce and possess, home-produced cane spirit – called bush rum, babash or mountain dew – is eternally popular, with a distinctive engine-oil aroma, a strangely pleasant taste and a wicked kick (it’s rumoured to be strong enough to make ice sink to the bottom of the glass), but to be safe, avoid it – it produces a horriﬁc hangover. Many drink their rum straight or with water, but Coke, tonic and coconut water are all excellent mixers, and a splash of Angostura bitters (see box, p.89) provides the ﬁnal ﬂourish. Trinbagonian rum punch is delicious, though, using blended fruits, syrup, bitters and a generous topping of ground nutmeg and/or cinnamon; most bars also offer the usual range of fruity cocktails – frozen margaritas are particularly good. Sweet and strong home-made wines – cashew, banana, aloes, hibiscus and so on – are excellent if you can get your hands on them; imported wine is widely available, though it’s usually expensive. Brand-name spirits like Johnny Walker whisky and Absolut or Grey Goose vodka are expensive and much loved by local drinkers; local alternatives (such as Blu vodka) are fairly\n\n33\n\nBASICS\n\n| The media 34\n\nThe media Dipping into the local media is an excellent way to acclimatize yourself to the nation’s cultural and political life. Outspoken columnists, scurrilous newspaper headlines, and local programming on TV, all offer a fascinating picture of Trini society – especially during Carnival, when TV shows preview costumes, road march songs and fetes, and the papers hotly debate the merits of the year’s calypsos.\n\nPrint and online Trinidad’s main daily newspapers are the Trinidad Guardian (Wwww.guardian.co.tt), a vaguely high-brow tome with a rather conservative attitude, the Express (Wwww .trinidadexpress.com) and Newsday (Wwww .newsday.co.tt); the latter two are picturedominated with plenty of space for their sometimes outspoken columnists – look out especially for B.C. Pires’s brilliant Friday column in the Express, and Kevin Baldeosingh’s writing in Newsday. All of the dailies have fat weekend editions with extended music, lifestyle and kiddies’ features, but the selection of salacious weekend scandal rags – The Bomb, Blast, Heat, TnT Mirror and particularly Sunday Punch – are incredibly popular. All carry hysterical headlines and plenty of bikini-clad women, as well as some wicked political satire and thinly disguised attacks on public ﬁgures. Tobago boasts only one paper, Tobago News (Wwww .thetobagonews.com), which is published on Fridays and concentrates on local sports, events and entertainment. Sold at Piarco and Crown Point airports, supermarkets and book stores, foreign magazines – Time, Newsweek, Cosmopolitan and the like – are easy to ﬁnd, but foreign newspapers – except for USA Today – are practically nonexistent. Of the local glossies, lifestyle and culture magazine Mako is worth a look, while Carnival souvenir magazines provide a good insight into T&T’s biggest festival; all are sold in pharmacies and supermarkets. Newspapers are sold at petrol stations, supermarkets, pharmacies and by street vendors. T&Ts wittiest bloggers are promoted online at Wwww.globalvoicesonline.org/-/ world/americas/trinidad-tobago, while the\n\nmost interesting news stories of the day from papers and news blogs are listed on Wwww.allyuh.com and www.trinidadand tobagonews.com. Finally, Wmeppublishers .blogspot.com is excellent on culture and current affairs, from the publishers of awardwinning magazine Caribbean Beat.\n\nTV and radio Trinidad and Tobago have several TV stations: TV6, TIC, ieTV, CNMG-TV and CMC TV, tending to show American soaps, sit-coms and game shows alongside educational and homegrown programmes. The main local news (with some international stories) is shown on TV6 at 7pm and 10pm. The best programming comes from the brilliant Gayelle (W www.gayelletv .com), which broadcasts only locally produced material: great if you can deal with the occasionally low production values. Synergy (W www.synergytv.net) is a musicoriented channel that broadcasts local stageshows and music videos. Cable TV is universally available and many hotels also have satellite TV; look out for Tempo, MTV’s Caribbean offshoot. Radio is hugely popular, keeping the nation tapping its collective feet and serving as a source of information on upcoming events and parties. From November until Ash Wednesday, most stations are entirely devoted to soca and calypso, but after Carnival the mood switches abruptly and you’ll hear reggae, R&B, hip-hop, rock and the inevitable “slow jams”. The best stations for contemporary local music are Soca 91.9 (W www.919socafm.com), Red 96.7 (W www.red967fm.com), and WEFM (With Energy For Music; has a great breakfast show), while numerous others broadcast\n\nEast Indian music, chutney and chat. Tobago’s Radio Tambrin – 92.7FM – (W www.tambrintobago.com) is an excellent\n\nway of keeping informed. For Trini stations on the net, visit W www.triniradio.net.\n\nBASICS\n\nTrinbagonians have a well-deserved reputation for partying. No religious event passes without festivity, and on the thirteen public holidays, banks and workplaces close and many take the opportunity to enjoy the country’s beaches. Concerts are organized, shops have holiday sales and the newspapers are full of events and articles relating to the celebrations. Public holidays embody T&T’s cultural and ethnic diversity, acknowledging Hindus, Muslims, Baptists, Roman Catholics, trade unions, and people of African and Indian descent. Every year there is a debate whether the Chinese should be given a day for Chinese New Year, and frequent discussion, too, as to whether the country has too many days off – but no politician is likely to risk offending a sector of the community by cancelling one. Other celebrations also function as public holidays, though they are not ofﬁcially recognized as such. The most famous holiday is Carnival, held on the Monday and Tuesday before Lent. In Trinidad, especially in Port of Spain, everything shuts down for both days, and usually for Ash Wednesday as well, to allow for recovery. For more on what’s on, look at W www.gotrinidadandtobago.com, and see the “Festivals” colour section. Most celebrations entail audience participation, such as dancing, singing along to songs and eating, while street festivals feature local artists, good food and lots of music, from rhythm sections to sound systems or steel pan. Religious days are also celebrated in small ways, even by those who are not followers of the religion – many Trinbagonians will light a deya for the Hindu festival Diwali, then the next week light a candle for the Roman Catholic celebration of All Souls’ day.\n\nFestival calendar\n\n| Festivals and public holidays\n\nFestivals and public holidays\n\nJanuary New Year’s Day A day usually spent recovering from the festivities of “Old Year’s Night” (as New Year’s Eve is known here), though it signals the start of the year’s round of Carnival fetes, and usually, the opening of Port of Spain’s calypso tents, where lyricists compete in a battle of wit and satire in the run-up to the Calypso Monarch Competition. Hosay This Islamic festival changes date every year, moving between January and June. A spectacular procession of handmade tombs and excellent tassa drumming, though the party elements are frowned upon by Muslim clerics. The biggest event takes place in the Port of Spain suburb of St James, though it is also celebrated in Curepe, Tunapuna, Couva and Cedros. See p.85.\n\nFebruary Carnival The country’s most famous festival, celebrated nationwide with fetes, pan and calypso competitions and costumed street processions.

It’s not a public holiday, but many Trinis of all backgrounds\n\n35\n\nPublic holidays in T&T BASICS\n\nNote that the Monday and Tuesday of Carnival as well as Ash Wednesday are also observed as public holidays. The dates of Hindu and Muslim festivals vary according to phases of the moon and other astronomical observations. When a public holiday falls on a Sunday, it is observed on the Monday, and when two holidays fall on the same date the following day is also given.\n\n| Festivals and public holidays\n\nJan 1 New Year’s Day March 30 Shouter Baptist Liberation Day March/April Good Friday & Easter Monday May 30 Indian Arrival Day May/June Corpus Christi June 19 Labour Day\n\nparticipate. Based on the Indian tradition of Holi, which celebrates the arrival of spring, it’s grown in popularity to become the Hindu equivalent of Carnival. See p.162 for more details. Good Friday and Easter Monday are days when people make enormous meals, visit relatives and head to the beach. On the Tuesday after Easter in Buccoo on Tobago, crab and goat races are held, a bizarre and entertaining spectacle (see p.223). In Trinidad, the skies above the Savannah glitter with kites on Easter weekend, with a competition for the biggest and best. Tobago International Game Fishing Tournament (W tgft.com) Big boats go after big ﬁsh from Charlotteville. Panyard Sensations Panyard concerts from the best of Trinidad’s steel bands.

The Black Virgin statue is carried in a procession through the town, while locals, decked out in new clothes, celebrate the event with feasting and merrymaking (see p.193). Pont Fortin Borough Day More a series of events than a day, from exhibitions, parties and concerts to beauty pageants, all of which culminate in a Jouvert (see p.83) and mas (masquerade) on the streets in early May, followed by a beach cooldown the next day.\n\nAug 1 Emancipation Day Aug 31 Independence Day Aug/Sept Eid ul Fitr Sept 24 Republic Day Sept/Oct/Nov Divali Dec 25 Christmas Day Dec 26 Boxing Day\n\nPan in the 21st Century Steel-band competition with a ﬁnal held in the Jean Pierre Complex, Port of Spain. Tobago Jazz Festival Though not as big as it once was (Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and Elton John appeared in 2007/8), this music festival still takes place with international and local artists performing on both islands; the main stage is at Plymouth. See the TDC (see p.54) and Caribbean Beat (see p.54) websites for more details.\n\nMay Ganga Dashara A Hindu river festival held on May 17 in Blanchisseuse, Trinidad. Indian Arrival Day May 30.

Corpus Christi June 10. A Catholic public holiday, celebrated with processions in small villages, though a quiet day in urban areas. Labour Day June 19. A public holiday held in recognition of trade unions and workers. It is most publicly celebrated in Fyzabad in southern Trinidad, where the powerful Oil Workers’ Union (see p.195) was established. St Peter’s Day June 29 (or nearest weekend). Celebrated in ﬁshing communities throughout T&T, with huge fetes on the beaches and pots of ﬁsh\n\nbroth sustaining hours of dancing. Charlotteville Fisherman’s Fete at Man O’ War Bay beach, Tobago, is the wildest all-night bash.\n\nAugust Emancipation Day August 1. The 1834 abolition of slavery is commemorated with a procession through Port of Spain. Celebrations were originally called Columbus’s Discovery Day but were replaced by Emancipation Day in 1985; diehards of the older festival still celebrate it in Moruga in southern Trinidad (see p.197). Great Race Speedboats navigate the dangerous currents of the Dragon’s Mouth in a race from Trinidad to Tobago. It starts from Chaguaramas in the morning, but the festivities take place at the ﬁnishing line at Store Bay in Tobago in the afternoon. Santa Rosa Festival Held the last week in August in Arima in Trinidad. Celebrates the culture and tradition of indigenous Amerindians with musical and acrobatic performances as well as obligatory feasting and street parties. Independence Day August 31.

Begins in mid-October and lasts until November when the Prime Minister announces the winner. T&T Awards The island’s equivalent of the Grammys, this event sees the Trinbago elite come out in glitzy outﬁts to congratulate successful musicians from all aspects of the country’s music scene. Diwali An end-of-month festival honouring Mother Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of light and spiritual wealth. The National Council of Indian Culture celebrates with nine days of shows, stalls and events (see Trinbago festivals colour section).\n\nBASICS\n\nJuly\n\nOctober\n\nNovember Eid-ul-Fitr Has no ﬁxed date as it signals the Islamic New Year, determined by the position of the moon. A relatively private and subdued affair, it marks the end of Ramadan and a month of fasting for Muslims with ritual songs sung in mosques. Donations are given to the poor and gifts are exchanged.\n\nDecember Parang A tradition of nativity songs sung in Spanish with a mix of French patois dating from colonial days; performed by Parang groups (Oct–Dec) in bars, nightclubs and door to door, ﬁlling the streets with rich, haunting music. Hearing these songs you might think you were in South America – until you detect the singers’ deep Trinbagonian accents (for more see p.278). Christmas Day Celebrated in Trinbagonian fashion with large social gatherings and plenty of feasting. People visit friends and relatives during the day and eat the obligatory Christmas fare: ham, pastelles and rich and fruity black cake. Festivities continue in bars, clubs, fetes and parties. Boxing Day December 26. Marks the start of the Carnival season, with radio stations playing continuous soca and calypso, and fetes and parties advertised with increasing frequency.\n\n37\n\nBASICS\n\n| Outdoor activities and adventure tours 38\n\nOutdoor activities and adventure tours A far cry from your average sun-sand-and-sea Caribbean destination, T&T offers plenty to do beyond the beach. The hugely rich natural environment affords many opportunities for birdwatching, hiking and waterfall hunting, while offshore pursuits include a range of watersports. For more, see our “Great Outdoors” colour section.\n\nBirdwatching Trinidad and Tobago ranks among the world’s top ten countries in terms of bird species per square kilometre, boasting a diversity unmatched in the Caribbean: more than 430 recorded species and around 250 known to breed. Migrant species from South America are most common between May and September, while birds from North America visit between October and March. The dry months (Jan–March or April) are traditionally the most popular time for birders to visit; during the wet season, however, birds grab whatever chance they can to feed between showers, so you’ll still see a lot of activity. The best place to start in Trinidad is the Northern Range at the acclaimed Asa Wright Nature Centre (Wwww.asawright.org; see p.132); workers there assert that even on a relatively short visit you can see as many as 150 species. Other stops include the Caroni Bird Sanctuary (see p.160), where you can take an afternoon boat tour to see the ﬂocks of scarlet ibis, the national bird and most arresting of the 156 species that live in this swampland. The Point-a-Pierre Wild Fowl Trust (see p.167) is an important waterfowl conservation centre nestling amid an industrial wasteland, with a successful breeding programme and the opportunity to see ibis up close. The best book to bring is Richard French’s encyclopedic Guide to the Birds of Trinidad and Tobago, which describes calls as well as plumage, habitats and behaviour. Online, visit Trinidad Birding (Wwww.trinidadbirding.com). Plenty of tour companies and guides specialize in birding tours (see p.40 for details). A short list of good places to go birdwatching include the Aripo Savannahs and Arena Dam, just south of Arima, (p.171); Mount St Benedict (p.138); Brasso Seco, off the Arima–Blanchisseuse Road (p.130);\n\nNariva swamp on the east coast (p.175); and Oropuche Lagoon in the southwest (p.190). Note that permits are needed for some of these sites; the guides listed on p.40 can arrange these for you. In Tobago, head for Little Tobago (or Bird of Paradise Island) on the windward coast (see p.256) to see seabirds in their natural environment; the Bon Accord Lagoon (see p.217), Adventure Eco Farm (p.232) and the Grafton Caledonia Bird Sanctuary (p.228) are also ﬁne bird-watching sites. At the protected Tobago Forest Reserve (see p.248), there are plenty of well-trained guides to accompany you.\n\nHiking Trinidad and Tobago are ideal for hiking, despite the searing sun – the best plan is to start early and cover plenty of distance before the midday heat sets in, or choose a hike that goes through forest. You don’t have to be supremely ﬁt for the easy trails, nor do you need special equipment. In Trinidad there is excellent hiking to be had in the forests of the Northern Range especially around Paria and Brasso Seco (see p.128 & p.138); or the Chaguaramas hills. Of the numerous waterfall hikes, Guanapo Gorge (see p.144) is particularly spectacular. The best hiking in Tobago is to be had in the rainforest reserve (see p.248). Don’t hike alone. In addition to incidents of tourist attacks on remote trails, there is no one to provide assistance if you run into problems; experienced local hikers always set out with two or more people. Plenty of tour companies provide private hiking trips (see p.40), but another, less expensive option is to join one of the excellent local groups on their regular weekend jaunts into rural areas, such as Hike\n\nThings to bring on a hike Shoes and clothing\n\nBring a sandwich lunch as well as concentrated high-energy food such as chocolate, dried fruit or nuts; a bag of cut sugar cane is great for maintaining energy and quenching thirst. A good-quality water bottle is a necessity and you’ll appreciate one that keeps your liquids cool. Other useful items to bring include: map, insect repellent, sunscreen, a good torch and spare batteries, toilet paper, rope, matches and plasters.\n\nSeekers (check the Express or Guardian newspapers on Fridays for details): you assemble at 7am, pay around TT$40 and set off. The group can normally arrange transport for you if you don’t have your own (call ahead), though you must provide your own food and water. Many other groups set out each weekend; scheduled hikes are posted in the “what’s on” sections of the daily newspapers, including those by the hundred-year-old Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists’ Club (T687 0514, Wwww.ttfnc.org), a slightly less visitor-friendly group that hike on the last Sunday of each month, leaving from St Mary’s College in Port of Spain at 6am (TT$40). Their Trail Guide (see p.296) makes essential reading, describing ﬁfty walks in minute detail. Be sure to abide by hiking etiquette: stick to paths and trails wherever possible, which avoids soil erosion and safeguards you from getting lost; bring rubbish – including cigarette butts – home with you, and bury used toilet paper; do not discard matches or cigarettes and make sure cooking ﬁres are completely extinguished – bushﬁres do happen; and ﬁnally, don’t collect plant or wildlife specimens.\n\nWatersports While snorkelling and scuba diving are popular on both islands, they are far better in\n\nTobago, where the water is clearer away from the sediment-heavy currents from the South American mainland. The best dive spots are centred around Speyside on the windward coast, where you can see pristine reef and a host of ﬁsh, including deep-water manta rays and the odd shark. Other top spots are offshore Charlotteville and the Sister’s Rocks on the leeward side, as well as the Shallows or Flying Reef at Crown Point; Buccoo Reef remains popular, as the disintegrating coral sadly reveals. Everywhere, you’ll see a dazzling variety of ﬁsh, from barracuda and grouper to angel, parrot, damsel and butterﬂy ﬁsh as well as spiny sea urchins and lobster nestled among the coral. Throughout the Guide, we have listed reputable dive operators (most of whom also rent snorkelling gear); for more details on prices, see p.216. If you prefer to stick to swimming, bear in mind that undertows and strong curren"
