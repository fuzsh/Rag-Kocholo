The book is divided into the following sections and you should be able to find whatever you need in one of them. The colour section is designed to give you a feel for Jerusalem, suggesting when to go and what not to miss, and includes a full list of contents. Then comes basics, for pre-departure information and other practicalities. The city chapters cover each area of Jerusalem in depth, giving comprehensive accounts of all the attractions, while the listings section gives you the lowdown on accommodation, eating, shopping and more. The excursions section includes a selection of day-trips, from Bethlehem to Tel Aviv.\n\nAuthor Picks Throughout this book, we’ve used the Rough Guides icon to highlight establishments our authors particularly recommend – a perfectly sited hotel, an atmospheric café, a special restaurant. The same icon is also used to flag up book recommendations in the Contexts section. Please send us your own nominations, which our authors will be happy to check out for future editions.\n\nContexts fills you in on history, religion and books, while the colour insert introduces religious architecture, and language gives you an extensive menu reader and enough Hebrew and Arabic to get by. Next comes the small print, including details of how to send in updates and corrections, and a comprehensive index. Colour maps covering the city can be found at the back of the book.\n\nThis second edition published October 2009.\n\nAbove: Ultra Orthodox Jews praying at the Wailing Wall © Eddie Gerald/Rough Guides Front cover image: The Dome of the Rock, Old City © E Simanor/PhotoLibrary Back cover image: Shopping in the Souq, Old City © Eddie Gerald/Rough Guides\n\n00 Jerusalem inside cover.indd 1\n\n18/06/09 4:58 PM\n\nThe Rough Guide to\n\nJerusalem\n\nwritten and researched by\n\nDaniel Jacobs\n\nwww.roughguides.com\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 1\n\n18/06/09 3:03 PM\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 2\n\n18/06/09 3:03 PM\n\nColour section\n\n1\n\nIntroduction................................ 4 What to see................................ 7 When to go................................. 9 Things not to miss.................... 10\n\nBasics\n\n17\n\nGetting there............................. 19 Arrival....................................... 23 Getting around.......................... 24 City tours.................................. 28 Security and crime.................... 29 Culture and etiquette................ 31 Gay and lesbian travellers......... 32 Travelling with children ............ 33 Travellers with disabilities......... 34 The media................................. 35 Travel essentials....................... 36\n\nThe City\n\n45\n\n1 Jaffa Gate and the Armenian Quarter................................. 47 2 Via Dolorosa and the Christian Quarter................................. 55 3 The Muslim Quarter............. 72 4 The Jewish Quarter.............. 84 5 The Temple Mount............... 99 6 East Jerusalem.................. 108 7 West Jerusalem.................. 124 8 Outlying areas.................... 144\n\nListings\n\nH Drinking and nightlife......... 194 I Entertainment.................... 199 J Sports and activities.......... 205 K Festivals and holidays........ 209 L Shopping........................... 216\n\nExcursions\n\n229\n\nBethlehem and around............ 231 Hebron.................................... 241 Jericho.................................... 243 The Dead Sea and Masada..... 248 Heading west: Abu Ghosh...... 252 Tel Aviv and Jaffa.................... 253\n\nContexts\n\n265\n\nA short history of Jerusalem.... 267 Religion................................... 275 Books..................................... 284\n\nLanguage\n\n291\n\nPronunciation, spelling and gestures................................ 293 Useful words and phrases....... 294\n\nSmall print & Index\n\n301\n\nThe Holy City colour section following p.80\n\n161\n\n9 Accommodation................. 163 G Eating................................. 177\n\n| CONTENTS |\n\nContents\n\nJerusalem\n\nColour maps following p.312\n\n3 ff The Muslim Quarter and the Dome of the Rock f On the way to worship\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 3\n\n18/06/09 3:03 PM\n\n| INTRODUCTI ON | W HAT TO S E E | W HE N TO G O\n\nIntroduction to\n\nJerusalem Ten measures of beauty gave God to the world: nine to Jerusalem and one to the remainder Ten measures of sorrow gave God to the world: nine to Jerusalem and one to the remainder The Talmud\n\nEverybody’s heard of Jerusalem (Yerushalayim in Hebrew, Al-Quds in Arabic), and most people have some image of it in their heads, but almost everyone who comes here is surprised at what they find. Sacred to three religions and once considered to be the centre of the world itself, the Holy City is, for all its fame, quite small, far from opulent and provincial in many ways. Yet it is undeniably a fascinating place, packed with museums, religious sites and ancient relics while still being a real, lived-in city, home to around 800,000 people.\n\n4\n\nJerusalem is home to three of the world’s most venerated places: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, held to be the location of the crucifixion, and the holiest site in Christendom; the Wailing Wall, last remnant of the Second Temple and most sacred Jewish relic in the world; and the Dome of the Rock – third most hallowed location in Islam, and the spot from where the Prophet Mohammed made his ascent to heaven. But even without these monuments the city has much to offer – from the narrow alleys and vibrant souqs of the magnificent walled Old City, to the churches and tombs of the Mount of Olives, and the expensive shops and lively bars of\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 4\n\n18/06/09 3:03 PM\n\n| INTRODUCTI ON | W HAT TO S E E | W HE N TO G O\n\ng Damascus Gate, Old City\n\ndowntown West Jerusalem. In fact, Arab East Jerusalem and Israeli West Jerusalem offer the visitor two worlds for the price of one: the tradition and relaxed pace of the Arab world and the cosmopolitan glitz of the West. And, in a city with an already diverse cultural mix, the assorted clergy from Christian sects worldwide, and the ultra-Orthodox of Mea Shearim in their eighteenth-century shtetl apparel, add further to the varied nature of the city’s inhabitants. Perched high in the Judean Hills, the city’s location is equally captivating. The view on approach is dramatic, with even the modern city providing a magnificent array of white high-rises that gleam in the sunlight – an architectural legacy of the first British governor, who declared that all new buildings must be made from local limestone, a ruling that has continued to be observed to this day. To its west lie the fertile planted fields, olive groves and settled villages of the coastal plain and the Judean foothills, while to the east the harsh desert of the Jordan Valley stretches out to a horizon that, on a clear day, offers glimpses of the Dead Sea. As far as politics is concerned, Jerusalem is at the heart of the Israel– Palestine question - hotly contested and deeply divided. It may be one city, but it’s evidently in two countries. Israel has taken the position, since 1967, that Jerusalem is the single indivisible capital of the Jewish state, and it is the country’s administrative centre, increasingly cut off from the West Bank by Israel’s Separation Wall; but the Palestinians also consider Jerusalem their capital – however unrealistic that may seem – and it remains the\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 5\n\n5\n\n18/06/09 3:03 PM\n\nThe four quarters | INTRODUCTI ON | W HAT TO S E E | W HE N TO G O 6\n\nThe four quarters of Jerusalem’s Old City – Muslim, Jewish, Christian and Armenian – began to evolve after Muslim sultan Saladin’s conquest of the city in 1187. Jews moved into the area around the Wailing Wall, Muslims into the area around the Dome of the Rock, and Christians into the area around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; meanwhile, an Armenian community had already established itself in the southwestern corner of the city around St James’s Cathedral. The division of quarters was never rigid, and there were always Jews living in the Armenian Quarter, Muslims in the Christian Quarter and so on, but by convention, Souq Khan al-Zeit divides the Christian and Muslim quarters, Bab al-Silsila Street divides the Muslim and Jewish quarters, Habad Street divides the Jewish and Armenian quarters, and David Street divides the Armenian and Christian quarters. All four quarters meet at the southern end of the Central Souqs (see p.76).\n\nfocus of their culture and aspirations. The two halves live uneasily side by side, a tension heightened by the construction of new Jewish settlements encroaching upon Palestinian land. All this can make Jerusalem a rather schizophrenic city, a frustrating and complex place that can seem overwhelming on a first visit. In fact such is the emotion it inspires in some visitors that it has its own (literally) schizophrenic mental disorder called Jerusalem Syndrome, whose sufferers believe themselves to be characters from the Bible – Jesus is the favourite, but others include Moses, King David, John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary. You might see them wandering the streets, dressed in the robes of their adopted persona. Other sufferers commit bizarre acts in their certainty of the imminent Second Coming: in 1969, an Australian tourist tried to burn down Al-Aqsa Mosque in preparation for Jesus’s imminent arrival. Despite its very real difficulties, Jerusalem is also a very beautiful city, teeming and alive. It’s a historical location without compare, the backdrop against which the stories of three religions were acted out. It was from here that Mohammed ascended to heaven on his night journey, from the same spot where God tested Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his son. It was\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 6\n\n18/06/09 3:03 PM\n\nWhat to see\n\nJ\n\nerusalem’s key attractions are, of course, the big religious sites: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Wailing Wall and the Dome of the Rock, all found within the walls of the labyrinthine Old City. A walk around the impressive Ottoman ramparts gives a wonderful introduction to the Old City, passing in turn each of its four traditional quarters.The Muslim Quarter holds some of the greatest treasures of Mamluk architecture, as well as much of the Via Dolorosa, along which Jesus is believed to have carried his cross. The Christian Quarter has some of the city’s most important souqs or markets. The Armenian Quarter includes Jerusalem’s citadel, known as the Tower of David. And the Jewish Quarter has been restored to preserve ancient remains like the old Roman Cardo or main street, as well as several old synagogues. Outside the walls are Mount Zion, where the Last Supper is believed to have taken place, and where the Virgin Mary is thought to have resided after the death of her son. Nearby is the City of David, Jerusalem’s original location, and to its east the ancient tombs of the Kidron\n\n| INTRODUCTI ON | W HAT TO S E E | W HE N TO G O\n\nthe residents of this city who welcomed Jesus by spreading palm leaves on the ground before him, along these streets that he dragged the cross, and here that he was executed upon it. Here, too, stood the capital of David and Solomon, home to the two Jewish Temples of antiquity, and this is the city for which the Jews, through all their centuries of exile and persecution, cried their ancient hope: “next year in Jerusalem”. Little wonder that it inspires such dreams, such devotion, such love and such madness.\n\nEast and West The 1948 Arab-Israeli War left Jerusalem divided, with West Jerusalem held by Israel, while East Jerusalem, along with the rest of the West Bank (the west bank of the River Jordan, that is), was taken by Jordan. The border between Israel and the West Bank – really an armistice line rather than a proper international frontier – is known as the Green Line after the colour of the ink used to draw it. In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel ended up occupying the West Bank, and unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem, but the two halves of the city remain very distinct. West Jerusalem, almost entirely Jewish, is the main commercial centre, and much like a European city, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, remains largely Palestinian (though Jewish settlers are moving in too), and is a lot more Middle Eastern.\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 7\n\n7\n\n18/06/09 3:03 PM\n\n| INTRODUCTI ON | W HAT TO S E E | W HE N TO G O 8\n\nThe Madaba map\n\nIn 1884, workers renovating an old church at Madaba in Jordan uncovered a sixthcentury mosaic bearing a map of Palestine, and prominent in the middle of it is a depiction of the city of Jerusalem. Much of the city’s geography is clearly visible, including the two main streets – the Cardo (Al-Wad Road) and the Cardo Maximus (Souq Khan al-Zeit, the central souqs and the “Cardo” of today; see p.92). The column at what is now the Damascus Gate (see p.72) is clearly shown, as are the Wailing Wall, the original building of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the then new – now long gone – Nea Church (see p.98). A reproduction of the Jerusalem section of the Madaba Map is displayed in Jerusalem beneath the Damascus Gate, and there are good reproductions of it online – one with the buildings labelled is posted on the city council’s website at Wwww.jerusalem.muni .il/english/map/madaba /cardo1e.html.\n\n00 Jerusalem colour intro.indd 8\n\nValley. The Mount of Olives offers wonderful vistas over the Old City, and beyond it is the village of Bethany, where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The downtown area of West Jerusalem includes the main shopping district, and the ultraOrthodox neighbourhood of Mea Shearim, and spreads out to encompass Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, as well as the excellent Israel Museum containing the Dead Sea Scrolls. Further out, you reach Yad Vashem, Israel’s monument to the victims of the Holocaust, and the beautiful suburban village of Ein Karem. If that isn’t enough, there are a number of fascinating places easily reached on a day-trip. Of these, the ancient fortress of Masada, gets many a visitor out of bed for 3am for the ever-popular excursions to climb it at dawn and see the sun rise from the top before checking out that weird natural phenomenon, the Dead Sea. Nearer at hand, royal David’s city of Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus, is almost within walking distance, through a checkpoint just ten minutes away by bus. Jericho, whose walls came tumbling down, takes a little more getting to, but still lies only an hour to the east. Westward meanwhile, the village of Abu Ghosh attracts lovers of fine Middle Eastern food, while further west, on the Mediterranean coast, is Israel’s commercial capital, Tel Aviv – the place to go for drinking and nightlife, but also for sightseeing, thanks to its wealth of Bauhaus architecture, and attractions such as the old city of Jaffa.\n\n18/06/09 3:04 PM\n\n| INTRODUCTI ON | W HAT TO S E E | W HE N TO G O\n\ng Praying at the Wailing Wall\n\nWhen to go\n\nS\n\npring (April and May) and autumn (Oct and Nov) are the ideal times to visit Jerusalem, when temperatures are agreeably warm, but not too hot. In summer, the heat can be uncomfortable though it’s a dry heat, and the altitude makes it cooler than Israel’s coastal plain, let alone Jericho where the heat can be oppressive. In winter, especially in January, Jerusalem can actually get pretty cold – even snow is not unknown – though it’s still generally bright and even warmish during the day, with temperatures falling rapidly after sunset. At most times of the year, you’ll want to wear loose-fitting cotton clothes, but you’ll need to carry at least some which are sufficiently “modest” to visit religious sites (long sleeves, especially for women, long trousers for men, and long skirts for women; see p.31). In winter, you’ll need at least a sweater or two as well, and in summer it’s a very good idea to bring a sun hat to keep you cool and protect you from heatstroke (see p.38).

If you’re planning to stay at a four- or fivestar establishment, it often makes sense to take a package tour, because of the huge discounts you can get on hotel rates. Very few firms offer Jerusalem city breaks as such, but any agent offering “tailor-made” tours can fix you up with a hotel and flight deal (specialist travel agents are listed on p.22).\n\nFlights from the UK and Ireland British Airways, BMI and El Al fly direct to Tel Aviv from London Heathrow, and El Al also run flights from Stanstead, as do Israel’s no-frills domestic carrier, Israir (though their flights are rather often subject to delay or cancellation). British low-cost airline Jet2 run flights from Manchester, and Thompsonfly, affiliated to package holiday firm Thompson, sometimes run flights from Luton and Manchester. From elsewhere in the UK or Ireland, you’ll need to take an indirect flight via London or a European hub such as Amsterdam, Frankfurt or Zurich. Indirect flights via Europe may also be a cheaper option from London. Expect to pay £240–375 including tax to fly to Tel Aviv from London in winter, £270–380 in summer. From Dublin, expect to pay €325–690/€375–760.\n\nFlights from the US and Canada There are direct flights to Ben Gurion from New York and LA (with El Al, Delta and Continental), Toronto (El Al and Air Canada), and Miami (Delta). From other North American airports, you’ll need to fly to one of those for a connecting flight (American Airlines codeshares with El Al, so they can sell you a through ticket via New York, Toronto or LA), or else fly via Europe with a carrier such as British Airways, KLM or Lufthansa. Typical fares (including tax) will be around US$1200 in winter, rising to around US$1600 in summer from New York, US$1400/2000 from LA, C$1000/1500 from Toronto.\n\n| Getting there\n\nMost visitors to Jerusalem arrive via Israel’s international airport, Ben Gurion (officially Tel Aviv’s airport), which is 45 minutes away from Jerusalem by bus or sherut (service taxi). A smaller number come by land from Jordan or Egypt.\n\nBASICS\n\nGetting there\n\nFlights from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand El Al offer direct flights from Johannesburg to Tel Aviv, and South African Airways codeshare this flight, allowing you to buy through tickets from the other airports they serve. However, it may be cheaper to fly via Addis Ababa, which has direct flights to Tel Aviv with Ethiopian Airlines. Fares from Johannesburg to Tel Aviv are typically R10,000–15,000 in January, R7500–12,000 in July. From Australia and New Zealand there are no direct flights, and Middle Eastern airlines such as Emirates do not serve Israel for political reasons, so your best bet is with\n\nAirline security Security on flights to Israel is always extra-tight, for obvious reasons. This is especially true on flights operated by Israel’s national carrier El Al (who run their own security checks in addition to anything the airport may provide), but also applies on other airlines. As a result, you will almost certainly be required to check in around three hours before your flight departure time.\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 19\n\n19\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nBASICS\n\n| Getting there 20\n\nQantas, Air New Zealand or a Southeast Asian airline in conjunction with El Al (whose services reach Bangkok, Beijing and Mumbai). Alternatively you could fly with South African Airways via Johannesburg, or even with a European airline via Europe. Typical fares from Sydney are A$2450–3000 in January, A$2500–3500 in July; from Auckland they are NZ$4300–9500 in January, NZ$3350–6050 in July.\n\nBy land from Jordan The journey from Amman in Jordan to Jerusalem can take anything from two to five hours in total, and the earlier you start, the more likely you are to complete it quickly. The best option, especially if you do not want an Israeli passport stamp (see box opposite), is to travel via the Allenby Bridge (known in Jordan as King Hussein Bridge, or Jissr al-Malik Hussein). You can either take a service taxi (from the southern end of Abdali Bus Station) and stay on until you reach the foreigners’ terminal at the bridge (not the terminal for Jordanians and Palestinians) or take a a JETT bus (6.30am daily, also from Abdali) all the way from Amman to the Israeli terminal. The first option means you have to take a bus across to the Israeli-held side – a ten-minute journey, but you can wait as long as two hours for the bus to fill up and go (you are not allowed to walk). If you’re travelling by the JETT bus note that if you do not want your passport stamped you will need to take it to the immigration desk yourself (rather than let the driver take it along with everybody else’s). Once through immigration and a security check on the Israeli side, you can pick up a service taxi to Jerusalem. It is also possible to take a direct bus from Amman to Jerusalem, but it will use the Bet Shean crossing (so you’ll get the border stamp in your passport) and it will take longer than coming via Allenby. Mazada Tours run buses whenever they have enough passengers (US$88 one-way plus US$10 border taxes, or US$33 on the way back plus US$15 for a Jordanian visa). For further information contact Neptune Tours (who run the tours in conjunction with Mazada) in Amman (T06/552 1493, [email protected]) or Mazada direct in Jerusalem (15 Jaffa Rd t02/623 5777, wwww.mazada.co.il).\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 20\n\nBy land from Egypt At one time the most obvious route from Egypt into Israel was via Rafah in the Gaza Strip, but that border is currently closed, as are crossings from Gaza into Israel, so the only overland route at present is via Taba, near Israel’s Red Sea port of Eilat. Taba can be reached by bus from Cairo or from Sinai beach resorts such as Dahab and Nuweiba, from which you may also be able to get a service taxi. Once across the border at Taba, you can take local bus #15a (hourly 8.20am–6.20pm) or a taxi into Eilat, and pick up an Egged bus to Jerusalem (4 daily; 5hr), but note that the last departure from Eilat is at 5pm Sunday to Thursday, and 1pm Friday; buses on Saturday, on the other hand, do not run until nightfall to avoid the Jewish Sabbath – see Wwww.egged.co.il/eng for departure times. More conveniently, Mazada Tours run direct buses from Cairo to Jerusalem, departing from the Cairo Sheraton hotel (Thurs & Sun 8am; US$145 one-way, US$165 return, including border taxes). For tickets and information, contact Misr Travel at the Cairo Sheraton (T02/335-5470) or Mazada in Jerusalem (see above). The only way to avoid getting an Israeli border stamp if coming from Egypt would be to take a boat from Nuweiba to Aqaba in Jordan and enter the West Bank via the Allenby Bridge (see above).\n\nAirlines, agents and operators\n\nAirlines Aer Lingus Ireland t0818/365 000, wwww .aerlingus.com.

Although the number of nations refusing entry has reduced, those taking a hard line against Israel (notably Syria, Lebanon, Libya and Sudan) continue with the practice which can cause problems for onward travel. In general, Israeli immigration officials will agree not to stamp your passport when asked, but do make this clear when you hand over your passport. Note that if you are coming to Jerusalem by land, Egyptian and Jordanian officials at borders with Israel will stamp your passport, and their stamps are as much evidence of a visit as stamps from Israel itself; the only way to avoid this is to enter and leave via the Allenby Bridge (see opposite). Note also that if you enter the West Bank and then come back to Jerusalem via an Israeli checkpoint with no Israeli entry stamp in your passport you may be subject to questioning. Some travellers have tried to get round the Israeli stamps problem by obtaining a new passport in Cairo or Amman once they have finished travelling in Israel. However this will also raise questions at immigration as will the use of any visa issued in Israel.\n\n21\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nSix steps to a better kind of travel BASICS\n\n| Getting there\n\nAt Rough Guides we are passionately committed to travel. We feel strongly that only through travelling do we truly come to understand the world we live in and the people we share it with – plus tourism has brought a great deal of benefit to developing economies around the world over the last few decades. But the extraordinary growth in tourism has also damaged some places irreparably, and of course climate change is exacerbated by most forms of transport, especially flying. This means that now more than ever it’s important to travel thoughtfully and responsibly, with respect for the cultures you’re visiting – not only to derive the most benefit from your trip but also to preserve the best bits of the planet for everyone to enjoy. At Rough Guides we feel there are six main areas in which you can make a difference: • Consider what you’re contributing to the local economy, and how much the services you use do the same, whether it’s through employing local workers and guides or sourcing locally grown produce and local services. • Consider the environment on holiday as well as at home. Water is scarce in many developing destinations, and the biodiversity of local flora and fauna can be adversely affected by tourism. Try to patronize businesses that take account of this. • Travel with a purpose, not just to tick off experiences. Consider spending longer in a place, and getting to know it and its people. • Give thought to how often you fly. Try to avoid short hops by air and more harmful night flights. • Consider alternatives to flying, travelling instead by bus, train, boat and even by bike or on foot where possible. • Make your trips “climate neutral” via a reputable carbon offset scheme. All Rough Guide flights are offset, and every year we donate money to a variety of charities devoted to combating the effects of climate change.\n\nSwiss US & Canada t 1-877/3597-947, UK t0845/601 0956, Ireland t1890/200 515, Australia t 1300/724 666, New Zealand t09/977 2238; w www.swiss.com.

All international flights arrive at terminal 3, domestic flights at terminal 1 (terminal 2 is currently out of use, but may be used in the future for low-cost airlines). Banks, ATMs and car rental facilities are available in the arrivals hall. For further information about the airport, visit the Israel Airports Authority website at w www.iaa.gov.il/rashat. A cab from Ben Gurion into Jerusalem will cost around 250NIS (£42/US$60) and take around 45 minutes. Alternatively Nesher Taxis (see p.27), run a 24-hour sherut (minibus) service from outside the terminal buildings, leaving when full, or an hour after the first passenger arrives, and currently costing 50NIS (£8.50/US$12). Nesher will usually drop you anywhere in town, though they do not currently drop off at the Damascus Gate, so you may have to make do with the New Gate or the Jaffa Gate if you are staying in the Old City, or with the Jerusalem Hotel (not far from Damascus Gate; see p.169) for East Jerusalem. It is also possible to reach Jerusalem by bus from the main gate of the airpoirt (#5 to “Airport City” and then #947 to Jerusalem’s Egged Central Bus Station), with a typical total journey time of 1hr 20min at a cost of 26.40NIS (£4.40/ US$6.25), just over half the price of a Nesher sherut, but a lot less convenient. The airport terminal also has a rail station, so you could feasibly get a train, though this would mean going to Tel Aviv and catching a Jerusalem-bound train there – a very long way round indeed.\n\nArriving from within Israel by bus you’ll find yourself at the Egged Central Bus Station on the Jaffa Road in West Jerusalem, about 2km from the city centre and the New Gate (the nearest entrance to the Old City). Numerous city buses run east along the Jaffa Road into town: #6, #13, #18 and #20 for downtown West Jerusalem (Mercaz Ha’Ir); #6 continues to a stop between the New Gate and the Damascus Gate. From around 2010, there will also be a tram service along the Jaffa Road to the city centre, New Gate and Damascus Gate. Should you decide to walk into town, exit onto the Jaffa Road, turn right and you’ll be in central West Jerusalem after a kilometre and a half, and at the New Gate after two. Buses from the West Bank drop you at one of the two bus stations in East Jerusalem (#18 from Ramallah at Nablus Road, #36 from Abu Dis at East Jerusalem Central Bus Station on Sultan Suleiman) both near the Damascus Gate. Bus #6 runs to West Jerusalem from near here, or it’s a fifteen-minute walk – look for the walls of the Old City, turn right alongside them up Sultan Suleiman and Paratroopers Road until the wall ends, and then take a right up the Jaffa Road. Mazda Tours buses from Cairo or Amman arrive at their office on the corner of Koresh and King Solomon at the northwest corner of the Old City, near the New Gate and the Jaffa Road.\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 23\n\nBy service taxi\n\n| Arrival\n\nJerusalem is in some ways quite easy to get your bearings in, with the Old City at the heart of things, downtown West Jerusalem immediately to its northwest, and East Jerusalem immediately to its north. Coming from Tel Aviv by bus or train, you’ll arrive in West Jerusalem, some distance from the centre, and need to take a bus or cab into town. From Ben Gurion airport, on the other hand, a service taxi (sherut) will take you to your hotel door, or at the very least, to the nearest Old City gate. Coming from the east (Jordan and the West Bank), you’ll probably arrive in East Jerusalem.\n\nBASICS\n\nArrival\n\n23\n\nSheruts (service taxis) from Tel Aviv (55NIS) run 24 hours a day, and most will bring you\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nBASICS\n\nto HaRav Kook Street, off Jaffa Road in the centre of downtown West Jerusalem. Service taxis from Allenby Bridge (35NIS) will leave you on Sultan Suleiman in East Jerusalem, near the Damascus Gate.\n\n| Getting around\n\nBy train Jerusalem’s train station has temporarily been shifted out to the suburb of Malha, 4km southwest of the city centre. Because the location is so inconvenient, and because the train journey to Jerusalem is so much longer than the bus journey, only rail buffs are likely to be using the train. There are ten trains a day to Malha from Tel Aviv via Lydda (Lod) and Ramla, except on Saturdays, when there is only one (at 10.30pm), and on Fridays the last train is at 2.45pm; journey time is an hour and forty minutes. Trains from other destinations, such as Haifa, connect at Tel Aviv (or, from Beer\n\nSheba, at Lydda). For schedules see w www .rail.co.il/en. To get into town from Malha, take bus #4, #6 or #18 from outside the station. When buying your train ticket, ask about discounts for train passengers on city buses into town. A new underground rail terminus is planned at Binyanei HaUma, on Jaffa Road near the bus station, and is expected to open around 2012.\n\nBy car Jerusalem is on the West Bank’s main artery, Route 60 (the Nablus–Hebron road), but most drivers will be approaching from Tel Aviv on the Ayalon Freeway (Route 1) via Latrun, a pretty straight run, taking about an hour. Coming into Jerusalem, steep gradients require you to switch down a gear (for more on driving see p.26).\n\nGetting around Walking is the best way to get around central Jerusalem, and certainly in the Old City, most of which is closed to traffic, though there are some steep slopes around town, and some of the Old City’s “streets” are actually more like staircases. For longer distances, take a bus or a cab. A tram line is under construction.\n\nEgged buses\n\n24\n\nJerusalem’s city bus services, run by Israel’s national bus company Egged (T02/530 4999; lines open Sun–Tues & Thurs 8.30am– 4pm, Wed 8.30am–2pm), are regular and efficient, though few and far between east of the Green Line, and they do not run on Shabbat (ie, from before sunset on Friday and all day Saturday; see p.276). The flat fare of 5.70NIS also makes them expensive for short hops, but they come into their own for visits to places in the outer western suburbs, such as Yad VaShem and Ein Kerem. The most useful connections are shown in the box opposite. Egged do not currently publish information on Jerusalem city bus routes in\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 24\n\nEnglish, largely because many routes have been diverted due to the construction of the new tramway (see opposite); a full list of routes can nonethless be found at W en .wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_egged_bus_lines, but note that these are subject to change.\n\nPalestinian buses One or two independent Palestinian bus operators run services to outer East Jerusalem, the most useful of which are: #36 from East Jerusalem Central Bus Station (also near the Damascus Gate) to Bethany and Abu Dis, via the Mount of Olives and Ras al-Amud; #75 from the Central Bus Station to Al-Tur; and #124 from the Central Bus Station\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nEgged bus connections From King George Street/ Jaffa Road –\n\n#1, #6 #1, #2\n\n#6 #38\n\n#1, #11, #15, #35 #10 #23, #26, #28 #17 #13, #17, #18, #20, #21, #23, #27, #39 #17 #27\n\n#4, #11, #35 #19 #4a, #19 #17 #17, #18, #20, #21\n\n#21, #102, #106 #6, #18\n\n#21, #102, #103, #106 #4, #6, #18\n\n#26\n\n–\n\nto the Rachel checkpoint (for Bethlehem). Note that some Arab buses have the same numbers as Egged buses – this does not mean that they run on the same routes.\n\nTaxis Tourists taking a taxi are often overcharged, but this is much less likely to happen if the driver uses the meter, which they are legally obliged to do on demand (though they may possibly then avoid taking the most direct route). If a driver does not want to use the meter, it will be because they want to overcharge you, so take another cab. A short hop in the city centre should cost around 20–30NIS; from the centre to the Israel Museum will cost around 30–40NIS, to Ein Karem around 60–80NIS. Note that fares are higher from 9pm to 5.30am and that many West Jerusalem taxi drivers will refuse to go to East Jerusalem. On the Arab side, a private taxi (as opposed to a service taxi – see below) is called a “special”. It is not local practice to tip cabbies, but they always appreciate it of course.\n\nTaxi firms Note that a 4.10NIS booking fee applies if you call a taxi company rather than hailing a\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 25\n\n| Getting around\n\nFrom Egged Central Bus Station #6, #13, #18, #20\n\nBASICS\n\nTo King George Street/ Jaffa Road Damascus Gate Dung Gate (for Wailing Wall) Mea Shearim Sanhedria Mt Scopus Israel Museum Mt Herzl and Yad Vashem Ein Kerem (village) Ein Kerem (Hadassah Hospital) Talpiot Malha (train station and mall) Biblical Zoo\n\n#17 #19\n\ncab in the street.

Generally you won’t find service taxis inside Jerusalem, but occasionally (for example between the Mount of Olives and the Damascus Gate) a special will function as a servees and charge a fixed fare for the run. This also sometimes applies in Bethlehem, from the checkpoint into town (see p.233).\n\nTrams\n\n25\n\nA tram line (or light railway) is under construction and should be up and running\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nPalestinian bus routes BASICS\n\n| Getting around\n\nPalestinian buses serving East Jerusalem and other nearby West Bank destinations leave from Nablus Road Bus Station, or from East Jerusalem Central Bus Station on Sultan Suleiman. The most useful are: #18 to Ramallah and Al-Bira (from Nablus Road Bus Station) #21 to Bet Jala (from East Jerusalem Central Bus Station) #36 to Bethany and Abu Dis (from East Jerusalem Central Bus Station) #75 to Augusta Victoria Hospital, Al-Tur and the Mount of Olives (from East Jerusalem Central Bus Station) #76 to Silwan (from East Jerusalem Central Bus Station) #124 to Mar Elias and Rachel checkpoint (for Bethlehem) (from East Jerusalem Central Bus Station)\n\nin 2010. The futuristic new tram bridge near the Egged Bus Station (see p.129) is already a Jerusalem landmark with its tall and elegant supporting column. The tram will run along Jaffa Road from the New Gate up to the Egged Central Bus Station, and then follow Sederot Herzl out as far as Mount Herzl and Yad Vashem. In the other direction from the New Gate, it will follow Paratroopers Road to the Damascus Gate and then head north up Hail HaHandassah (the Green Line, still in theory an interÂ� national boundary) up towards Sheikh Jarrah, crossing into East Jerusalem to serve the Jewish settlements of Pisgat Zeev and Neve Yaakov. Despite opposition from both the PLO (because it serves Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem) and local motorists and shopkeepers (whose business has been adversely affected during construction), the tram will eventually be a very welcome addition to the city’s public transport system, and more lines are set to follow. Further information should eventually be posted online at W www.citypass.co.il. In the meantime, some information, and maps of the route (under “First System”) can be found at Wwww.rakevetkala-jerusalem.org.il.\n\nDriving\n\n26\n\nIsraeli and Palestinian driving is notorious. Expect other motorists to drive aggressively, to tailgate dangerously on fast roads, to hog the overtaking lane on motorways (and overtake on the nearside) and not to bother indicating. At traffic lights (which change\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 26\n\ndirectly from red to green, though some now count down with digital displays), you’ll be honked immediately by drivers behind if you are not very quick off the mark when they change. That said, if you drive defensively and do not allow other motorists to intimidate you, you can drive as safely here as in any other Mediterranean country. Around town, you’ll find that Jerusalem’s drivers are a little more relaxed than those in the rest of Israel, though you shouldn’t expect them to ever give way. Most routes are well signposted. During rush hours (7–9am and 4–6pm), the city centre and major routes in and out of town are frequently gridlocked, and construction of the tramway (see above) has temporarily made this problem a lot worse. Note also that Haredi residents of Mea Shearim take a very dim view of driving on Shabbat, and may stone motorists who drive through their neighbourhood then. Another problem lies in Jerusalem’s position astride the Green Line. If you have an Israeli car, with yellow plates, it may attract hostility on the West Bank, while a Palestinian car can attract unwanted attention in Israel. In any case, most car rental agencies in Jerusalem will not allow you to drive their vehicles into “Area A” of the West Bank (under PA control), including Bethlehem, Bethany and Jericho.\n\nLeaving town The best way to get to most parts of Israel is by Egged bus from the Egged Central Bus Station, 2km from the city centre on Jaffa\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nFor Tel Aviv (Ben Gurion) airport, Nesher Taxis at 23 Ben Yehuda (T02/625 7227 or 1599/500 205, Wwww.neshertours.co.il) run a 24-hour shuttle service, and will pick up in most parts of town, but you need to book ahead, especially as their office is closed on Shabbat. Mike’s Centre (see p.28) can also arrange transport to the airport, for 65NIS. Some Egged buses (#947 to Haifa, for example) stop at the airport gate on the Jerusalem–Tel Aviv freeway, but this leaves you with the problem of how to get to your terminal (a very long walk indeed), and for the small amount of money you save, it isn’t worth the trouble.\n\nAirline offices El Al’s office in Jerusalem is at 12 Hillel T 02/677 0200. Other airlines mostly have their offices in Tel Aviv or at Ben Gurion airport (see pp.20–22 for phone numbers). The most useful travel agent is student travel specialist ISSTA, at 31 HaNeviim (at Jaffa Road) T 02/535 8600, and 4 Herbert Samuel (off Zion Square) T02/621 1888, both offices open Monday to Thursday 9am to 7pm, Friday 8.30am to 1pm.\n\nTo Tel Aviv Service taxis (sherut) to Tel Aviv are operated 24/7 by Habira (T02/625 4545; usually from HaRav Kook, just off Jaffa Road, but on Saturdays from Heil HaHandassa, west side, just south of HaNeviim), with a less convenient six-day service run by HaUma on Jaffa\n\n| Getting around\n\nBy air\n\nRoad near the Egged Central Bus Station (T02/538 9999), and the “Haredi express” to Tel Aviv’s ultra-orthodox suburb of Bnei Brak by Geula at 20 Strauss near Mea Shearim (T02/625 1222). Until Binyanei HaUma station opens around 2012 (see p.24), taking a train to Tel Aviv involves trekking out to Malha, 4km south of the centre (buses #4 and #18 from King George St, #6 from Jaffa Rd), where there are ten daily departures (1hr 40min; no trains on Shabbat), connecting for destinations up and down the coast.\n\nBASICS\n\nRoad. This can be reached on city bus #6 from Jaffa Road opposite the Post Office; #13, #18 or #20 from further up Jaffa Road, and will be served by the new tram. Direct buses to Cairo are operated by Mazada Tours (see p.20).\n\nTo West Bank destinations There are few direct buses or service taxis to West Bank destinations except for those listed in the box opposite, plus Allenby Bridge, and of course Jewish settlements, including the Jewish side of Hebron (from which it is possible for foreigners to cross to the Palestinian side). Otherwise, you will need to take a bus to Ramallah for points north (including places just outside Jerusalem such as Al-Jib or Nabi Samwil), to Abu Dis for Jericho, and to Bethlehem for points south (including the Palestinian side of Hebron).\n\nTo Jordan via Allenby Bridge Service taxis for Allenby (King Hussein) Bridge are operated by Abdo (1 Sultan Suleiman, opposite Damascus Gate T02/628 3281) and Alnijmeh (Sultan Suleiman, by Golden Walls Hotel T02/627 7466). The current fare is 35NIS. It’s best to start off early for Amman; service taxis leave from 7am until around 11am Sunday through Thursday, but only until 9.30am on Fridays and Saturdays. After that, you will need to hire a “special” (private taxi), which will cost around 300NIS.\n\n27\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 27\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nBASICS\n\nCity tours\n\n| City tours\n\nIf you want to see the main sights quickly or perhaps want a more in-depth look at some aspect of the city, it can make sense to take a guided tour. Jerusalem has a large number available. A bus tour takes the weight off your feet, and can take you out of town too, but walking tours take you to places that buses cannot reach, most notably inside the Old City. Note that tour prices do not include site entry fees; if you are visiting a number of sights it may be worth investing in a combined ticket.\n\nBus tours The easiest way to get a sense of the layout and size of Jerusalem is to take a panoramic tour on Egged’s double-decker bus #99 (see below). Several private firms also offer coach tours of Jerusalem and to places such as Masada and Nazareth. In addition to the firms listed here, hostels such as the Palm (see p.167) and Citadel (see p.166) offer Masada excursions. Egged t1-700/707 577 or 03/920 3919, wwww .egged.co.il/eng. Runs the open-topped #99 tour taking in most areas of the city and many of the most important sights with commentary in eight languages including English. There are five daily departures (currently leaving the bus station at 9am, 11am, 1.30pm, 3.45pm and 6pm), except on Fridays, when only the first three run, and Saturdays, when there are none. You buy tickets on board. A day-ticket allowing you to change buses is 80NIS, a two-day ticket 110NIS. Egged also run a half-day Old City tour (US$42), a oneday Jerusalem tour (US$62), and day trips to, among other places, Masada (US$92), or Nazareth and the other main Christian sites in Galilee ($82).

Range of tours including “Jerusalem Old and New” (US$62) as well as Galilee and the Golan Heights (US$255).\n\nWalking tours\n\n28\n\nIn addition to the firms listed here, there are specialized walking tours run for groups by freelance tour guide Khalil Toufagji (T02/234 4859), or by former Palestinian activist Ali Jiddah (T 052/283 1542). Israeli archeologists also run an occasional “Alternative\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 28\n\nArcheological Tour” in the area south of the Old City (see p.115).

You’ll also find combined tickets (sold at the ticket offices at the sites) for any two, or all three, of the Burnt House, Wohl Museum and One Last Day Museum – a ticket for all three, at 45NIS (valid for one day), saves you 12NIS.\n\nBASICS\n\nallowing you to download your own audio guide from the internet. All you then need is an MP3 player and you can guide yourself at your own pace. A wide variety of routes are available for download – the site is at W www .jerusalemp3.com. The settlers’ organization Elad (see p.115) also offer a “Jerusalem Trail” audio tour on their website at W www.cityofdavid.org.il.\n\nSecurity and crime Security is obviously a concern for visitors to Jerusalem and the other areas covered in this guide. In recent years there have been suicide bomb attacks on civilian targets in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv though at the time of writing violence had become more isolated (in the case of Jerusalem thanks in part to the construction of the Separation Wall, see p.234). There is also a slight risk of being caught up in political demonstrations which have the potential to turn violent. That said, tourists rarely encounter any problems. In fact, in terms of common crime, Jerusalem is a lot safer than most Western cities, though as anywhere you should always take precautions and stay as well informed as possible about the current situation.\n\nSecurity Because of the permanent state of tension, security, in the form of the police and army, is always present on the streets of\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 29\n\nJerusalem. In public places, always keep your belongings with you since baggage left unattended may be reported to the police as suspicious, and either confiscated or\n\n29\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nBASICS\n\n| Security and crime\n\ndetonated. Similarly, if you notice an unguarded package, you should report it to a bus driver, storeowner, hotel staff or whoever else seems relevant. Expect to have your bags checked frequently, especially at entrances to museums, large stores, supermarkets, cinemas and post offices. You are required by Israeli law to carry ID (which basically means your passport) at all times, but keep it well hidden from pickpockets. Going into sensitive sites, such as the Wailing Wall or Temple Mount, you’ll have to pass through a metal detector and have your bag searched; it will save time for you and everybody else at such places if you carry the minimum of baggage and have your camera, keys, mobile and anything else that might go bleep ready to hand over before you go through the metal arch. The Israeli army (IDF or Tzahal) are visible everywhere and the sight of fully armed khaki-clad soldiers walking around the streets is a common and, until you get used to it, slightly shocking one. Do remember, however, that pretty much everyone in Israel does military service. The army therefore consists of ordinary Israeli youths, and the soldiers you see out and about will often be off-duty and making their way home or to base.\n\nTrouble spots\n\n30\n\nOn the West Bank (including East Jerusalem and the Old City administered by Israel), there is a slight but real possibility of being caught up in disturbances. Any demonstration by Palestinians or Israeli settlers may turn violent. Always keep your ear to the ground and avoid troublespots. At the time of writing, the UK Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to the West Bank other than to East Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Jericho and the Dead Sea area; note that this advice currently means avoiding Hebron, which is a notorious flashpoint (see p.241). The US State Department took a stronger line warning against all travel to the West Bank outside Jerusalem. Note also that kidnapping or attempted kidnapping of Western nationals in West Bank towns such as Nablus and Jenin is not unknown, so it is wise to follow travel advisories regarding\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 30\n\nwhich areas are safe to visit. Israeli checkpoints are ubiquitous all over the West Bank, but foreigners are usually fast-tracked unless they are (or look) Muslim or Arab. While you may find questioning and delays at these checkpoints annoying, remember that as a tourist you will not be subject to anything like the delays and indignities that local residents are – always answer questions politely and patiently, and whatever you do, don’t lose your temper.\n\nGovernment advisories Australian Department of Foreign Affairs wwww.dfat.gov.au, www.smartraveller.gov.au.

US State Department wwww.travel.state.gov.\n\nCrime The crime rate as such is not high in Jerusalem, though it’s higher in poorer areas of East Jerusalem than it is on the more prosperous west side of town. Petty theft at cheap hostels (and also on Tel Aviv beaches) is unfortunately quite common, so never leave your valuables unattended in such places (most have safes or lockers available). Passports fetch high rates on the black market, and so are particular targets. In the Old City, especially in crowded areas, pickpocketing is also quite common. If you do need to report a crime, the police stations by the Citadel, in the Russian Compound, and at 107 Jaffa Rd are used to dealing with tourists. There’s also a dedicated tourist police post at the entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Police on the street in West Jerusalem are part of the ordinary civilian police force (w www.police.gov.il/english); most of those in East Jerusalem (including the Old City) belong to the Border Police, who are part of the IDF. Drugs are strictly illegal in Israel, even cannabis (though it is quite widely used), and you will at the very least be deported if you\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nGenerally speaking, sexual harassment of women is no more an issue in Jerusalem than it would be at home, and Israeli and Palestinian women alike are pretty tough and take no nonsense. As a tourist, especially if you are young, and especially if you are blonde, you will attract a certain amount of\n\n| Culture and etiquette\n\nSexual harassment\n\nmale attention. This may be more noticeable in East Jerusalem and the Old City than in West Jerusalem, and it’s a good idea to avoid deserted Old City streets at night. Following the rules on modest dress (see below) will help avoid unwanted attention. Of more concern are the reported incidents of sexual assault of female tourists on the Mount of Olives, and though none of these are recent, it’s an area worth avoiding on your own, and especially at night. It’s also a good idea, if taking a cab with a male driver, to sit at the back rather than in the front passenger seat. Note that under Israeli law sexual harassment is a criminal offence. If the very worst should happen, the Rape Crisis Centre has an emergency hotline for victims of rape and sexual harassment at T 1202 or 02/625 5558.\n\nBASICS\n\nare caught with any. If you look the type, or if you look Palestinian, especially if walking around late at night, and often at entrances to the Old City, the police may stop you to check your ID, and if they do that, they may also go through your pockets. Note, too, that jay-walking is illegal, so stick to official crossings and wait for the green man, or you could incur a fine.\n\nCulture and etiquette In Jerusalem, religion and politics are never far away, and people’s views on both can be fervent if not fanatical. You are unlikely to avoid political discussions, but it is always best to be tactful if you disagree with people, and remember that views which may be considered extreme in the West are quite commonplace among Israelis and Palestinians. As far as religion is concerned, you would be unlikely (and indeed unwise) to enter into any debate on the subject, but you should bear in mind that religious people can seriously object to what they consider “immodest” clothing, particularly on women, and particularly in religious buildings, on Temple Mount, or in the ultraorthodox Jewish district of Mea Shearim. Modest attire – loose-fitting dresses, or long skirts and long-sleeved baggy tops – is therefore advisable at all times and a must at religious sites and in orthodox areas – keep yourself well covered, with no shorts or bare shoulders (at Muslim sites in particular, men should be covered to below the shoulder and below the knee, women to the wrist and the ankle). T-shirts are\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 31\n\nusually permissable for men if they cover the shoulder, though some people in Mea Shearim frown on even short sleeves, and also on women wearing trousers. Ignoring these dress codes may make you the target of hostility from religious Jews and Arabs alike – usually in the form of verbal abuse, but violence such as stone-throwing is not unknown. Public displays of affection are frowned on by religious Jews and Muslims alike, and people who drive through ultra-orthodox areas on Shabbat may find their car being stoned by residents. During religious fasts such as Ramadan and Yom Kippur, people will also object to you eating or smoking in public, and you may feel it would be inconsiderate anyway; in any case, you should\n\n31\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nBASICS\n\n| Gay and lesbian travellers\n\nalways be able to find a part of town where people are not fasting. Photography can be contentious. Always ask before you start snapping away at people (especially Haredi Jews, who object to taking photographs on the basis that it constitutes “making a graven image”), or inside synagogues, churches or mosques. It\n\nis likewise best to avoid taking photographs in places that could be regarded as security installations (airports or checkpoints for example); at the very least, ask permission first. Also be wary of photographing outbreaks of trouble: it is not unknown for Israeli soldiers to break or confiscate cameras.\n\nGay and lesbian travellers Israel is the most gay-friendly country in the Middle East. Palestine, on the other hand, is extremely hostile to gay people, some hundreds of whom, from the West Bank and Gaza, live illegally in hiding in Israel as a result. Israel’s gay scene however centres on Tel Aviv; in Jerusalem it is extremely low-key. Israel legalized sex between men in 1988 (thanks to the Mandate-era British law on the subject, it was never illegal between women – the preferred wisdom being that lesbianism didn’t exist). In 1992, Israel banned discrimination on grounds of sexuality. Lesbian couples can adopt children born to one of them by artificial insemination, and though gay marriage isn’t possible in Israel (where only religious weddings are allowed), singlesex marriages from abroad are recognized, which gives them the same status as interdenominational heterosexual marriages. In PA-controlled areas, by contrast, sodomy remains a crime, attracting a six- to ten-year sentence, and the law is enforced by police entrapment squads, with beatings meted out to those arrested for it. Persecution of gay men and lesbians by family and neighbours is no less severe. Despite Israel’s laudably tolerant official attitude, Jerusalem’s gay life has lately been in retreat. The city used to host an annual Gay Pride Parade, but opposition from the religious right forced it in 2008 to relocate to Tel Aviv. On top of this, Jerusalem’s only gay bar,\n\nShushan, closed in 2007, leaving its unusually assorted clientele of Haredi, Palestinan and secular Jewish gays without a hangout. The bohemian café Tmol Shilshom (see p.164) is gay-friendly, but mostly heterosexual. For gay men, the traditional cruising ground is Independence Park (see p.136), as it is in Tel Aviv, and the two synonymous parks gave their name to Amir Sumaka’i Fink and Jacob Press’s book, Independence Park: The Lives of Gay Men in Israel (Stanford University Press, 1999), a collection of twelve first-hand accounts of gay life for Israeli men.\n\nContacts Jerusalem Open House T02/625 0502, W www .worldpride.net.

Shilav, in the Jerusalem Mall (kanyon) at Malha (see p.222), is the local branch of Israel’s main children’s clothing and equipment chain (wwww.shilav .co.il), which should be able to sort you out if you’ve forgotten anything. Breastfeeding in public is fine in downtown West Jerusalem, so long as you are a little bit discreet about it. In Mea Shearim, however, it is a definite no-no, and in East Jerusalem it should be very discreet. Children (especially young ones) are more susceptible than adults to heatstroke and dehydration, and should always wear a sunhat, and have high-factor sunscreen applied to exposed skin if spending time in the sun. The other thing that children are very susceptible to is an upset tummy. Note that most antidiarrhoeal drugs are not suitable for young children; always read the dosage instructions or consult a doctor for guidance. Israeli and Palestinian food is not especially spicy, and should not be a particular challenge, but branches of American fast food chains exist in downtown West Jerusalem should you need them (see p.177).\n\nThere are plenty of things for kids to do in Jerusalem. The most obvious attractions are the Biblical Zoo (p.156) and the Train Puppet Theater (p.203). The Bloomfield Science Museum (p.148) should also appeal to most young people, and the Mifletzet (see p.155) certainly will, though it’s quite a way from the centre just for a slide. The youth wing in the Israel Museum (p.146) – when it reopens – may be of interest to older children, who may also enjoy the Time Elevator (p.125) and Hezekiah’s Tunnel (p.114). What younger children may not like, especially if you are visiting West Bank towns such as Bethlehem (p.231), let alone Hebron (p.241) – where you should definitely not be taking children – are the checkpoints and their undercurrent of tension, though it should not be too different from passing through an airport, and foreigners, especially with children, will in any case be fast-tracked. Mark Podwal’s book, Jerusalem Sky: Stars, Crosses and Crescents (reviewed on p.289), introduces children to Jerusalem as a city holy to three faiths, while avoiding its troubles and controversies.\n\n| Travelling with children\n\nJerusalem is not an especially difficult place to visit with children, and aside from the security situation (see p.29), presents no special problems.\n\nBASICS\n\nTravelling with children\n\n33\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 33\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nBASICS\n\n| Travellers with disabilities 34\n\nTravellers with disabilities Israel has advanced in leaps and bounds in increasing accessibility, but it is not yet up to Western standards. Modern public buildings are usually accessible, so you should have no trouble getting around places such as museums, shopping malls or cinemas if they are not too old. Large, expensive hotels are also likely to be fully accessible, especially if new; little Old City private hostels on the other hand are not, but modern official youth hostels are. Modern museums, such as the Israel Museum (see p.144), Bible Lands Museum (see p.147), Bloomfield Science Museum (see p.148) and Ticho House (see p.128), are all wheelchair-accessible, as is Yad VaShem (see p.151), and some of these also have aids for people with impaired vision or hearing. The Wailing Wall is accessible (with even a disabled toilet on site), and the Holy Sepulchre is partly accessible (there are a few small steps at ground level, and Calvary is up a steep staircase), but Temple Mount is not accessible unless you can arrange to enter via Bab al-Asbat, in the northeastern corner, off the Via Dolorosa, which is normally open only to Muslims. The Jerusalem Centre for the Performing Arts (see p.202) and Teddy Stadium (see p.205) are also wheelchair-accessible. Getting around the Old City in a wheelchair is difficult but not impossible. It would certainly help to have an assistant, as there are a lot of steep slopes and single steps. The Via Dolorosa is like a staircase in some parts, but the section from the Lions’ Gate to Al-Wad road is negotiable (though you’d need to get up to Lions’ Gate), as is Al-Wad from there to the Wailing Wall. In West Jerusalem, things are easier, but even there, don’t expect kerb ramps at road junctions for example. The best source of information for visitors with disabilities is the excellent Access in Israel by Gordon Couch. Published in 2000, it’s a little bit dated now, but it has a wealth of information on accessible accommodation, and a wonderful step-free map of the Old City for wheelchair users, which unfortunately\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 34\n\nis not available in the online version of the book at Wwww.accessinisrael.org. Hostels and hotels which have rooms adapted for wheelchair users include: Agron Youth Hostel (see p.167), Yitzhak Rabin Youth Hostel (p.173), Christ Church Guest House (see p.168), Eldan (p.171), Inbal (p.175), King David (p.175), King Solomon (p.175), Prima Kings (p.175), Mount Zion (see p.175), Sheraton (p.175) and Ramat Rahel Kibbutz (p.176), but some of these have only one adapted room, and it’s a good idea to book as far in advance as possible, and always check of course that they can meet your specific needs. Hotels which claim to be wheelchairaccessible but do not have specially adapted rooms include Beit Shmuel Hostel (p.171) and the Ambassador Hotel (p.169). The Gloria (p.168) can accommodate wheelchairs up to 70cm wide only.\n\nContacts for people with disabilities Access 4 You T03/967 7796, Wwww.access4you .co.il.

Most of its news is Israeli but it does have some international coverage, plus a rundown of TV and radio programmes, cinema listings, night pharmacies, exchange rates, weather and handy phone numbers. The Friday edition is particularly helpful, with a supplement giving more detailed “what’s on” information. The other Israeli newspaper available in English is the liberal daily Haaretz (W www .haaretz.com), which is somewhat more heavyweight than the Jerusalem Post, and gives a rather more considered Israeli view of the news. The English edition is not sold separately but comes as a supplement with the International Herald Tribune. Like the Jerusalem Post, it has a weekend section on Friday with entertainment listings. Other English-language publications covering news and politics include: the Jerusalem Report, a glossy news magazine similar in style to Time or Newsweek. There are no longer any Palestinian newspapers or magazines in English, so if you want a Palestinian angle on the news, you will have to look online. Websites worth checking include the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre (W www .jmcc.org), the Alternative Information Centre (W www.alternativenews.org) and the Palestine News Network (W english .pnn.ps). The World News Network’s Jerusalem page at W www.wn.com/jerusalem is a good source of local news from an organization with no Israeli or Palestinian axe to grind; its stories come from a variety of international sources.\n\nIsrael has two terrestrial television channels, but a large number of stations on digital, cable or satellite, of which pretty much all hotels and local households have one or the other. More time is devoted to politics in comparison to British or American TV, with lots of political discussion shows, but there’s also the usual diet of quiz shows, dramas, soaps and sitcoms, plus English-language films and programmes from the UK and US, subtitled in Hebrew and sometimes Arabic, or even Russian. Channel 1 is financed by TV licence fees and carries no advertising (though it has programme sponsorship), Channel 2 is financed by commercials and caters more to popular taste. Channel 10 is very similar. Middle East TV, a Christian-run station that broadcast from South Lebanon under Israeli occupation, now broadcasts from Cyprus and is available on most Israeli sets. A number of channels are also provided by satellite broadcaster Yes and by cable provider HOT.\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 35\n\n| The media\n\nThe media in Hebrew is extremely diverse, but that in Arabic is much more limited. English-language publications are even thinner on the ground, with only one daily newspaper in English, though there are a few magazines. On television, however, many programmes are in English with Hebrew and/or Arabic subtitles.\n\nBASICS\n\nThe media\n\nRadio Israeli radio stations include Radio 1 (Reshet Aleph, mostly talk shows in Hebrew) on 531 and 1458 MW and 98.4 FM, HaDerekh (music and traffic news for motorists; 88 FM), and the Voice of Music (Kol HaMusiqa; 91.3 FM) playing classical music. Radio 3 (Reshet Gimel; 97.8 FM) plays commercial (and usually old) pop music. The Voice of Israel (101.3 FM) broadcasts news in English at 6.30am, 12.30pm and 8.30pm. The Israeli Broadcasting Authority maintains a full list of frequencies online at wwww.iba.org.il /reception.

Your biggest single cost will probably be accommodation, with the cheaper hostels charging 30–50NIS (£5– 8.50/US$7.50–13.25/€5.60–9.35) a night for a dorm, 120–200NIS for a double room (£20–35/US$32–55/€22.50–37.50). In a mid-range hotel, you can expect to be paying US$120–180 (£78–120/€95–145) a night, and for a four-star place upwards of US$200 (£130/€160). A single room may cost you the same as a double, though you would usually expect to pay a quarter to a third less. Eating out can also hit your wallet, but the quality of food matches the price. You can fill up at a hummus joint for as little as 15NIS (£2.50/US$4/€2.80). A typical meal will cost you 50–80NIS (£8.50–13.50/US$13–21 /€9.50–15) at a cheap place including a drink, 100–150NIS (£17–26/US$26–40 /€18–28) in a mid-range restaurant, and 200–250NIS (£35–45/US$50–65/€35–50) in a relatively pricey establishment. Service is not generally included in bills, and you are generally expected to leave a tip of around 12 to 15 percent (in fact many waiting staff get no pay other than tips). That being the case, you can survive in Jerusalem on a daily budget of £40/ US$65/€50 if you stay in a hostel dorm, eat simply, don’t go out drinking, and don’t buy too many souvenirs. Staying in mid range hotel and eating in moderately priced restaurants, with the odd splurge, you can expect\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 36\n\nto spend around £140/US$200/€160 a day. On the other hand, if you stay in a five-star hotel, eat in the best restaurants and take taxis everywhere, you’ll easily be getting through some £350/US$500/€400 a day.\n\nVAT (sales tax) Value Added Tax (17 percent) for items (other than tobacco and electrical or photographic goods) bought at stores recommended by the Tourism Ministry is refundable at the airport when you leave Israel (or when leaving the West Bank at Allenby), provided the goods are in a sealed transparent bag, and that you have an invoice stating the amount of VAT paid. You are also exempt from VAT on hotel bills, car rental or air tickets, so long as you pay in local currency.\n\nStudent discounts If you are a full-time student, it’s worth getting an International Student ID Card (ISIC, wwww.isiccard.com), especially if you plan to do a lot of sightseeing, as it can usually save you a few bucks – generally in the order of around 25 percent – on entry charges at museums and archeological sites.\n\nElectricity The electricity supply is 220v 50Hz. Israel has its own three-pin plugs and sockets, but they will take two-pin European plugs. British, Irish, North American and Australasian plugs will need an adapter (which you should bring from home), and double-round-pin electric shavers, if they have fatter pins than\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nEntry requirements\n\nVisa extensions and work permits Visa extensions can be obtained by appointment only from the Ministry of Interior Office at 1 Shlomzion HaMalka, by the junction of Koresh (to make an appointment call T02/629 0239 – they say to call Sun–Thurs 10am–2pm, but in practice it is extremely difficult to get through, and best to start calling around 8am). When you do get an appointment you will need to show proof of your ability to support yourself. The fee is 145NIS, and you’ll need a passport photo. It always helps to dress well and give an air of affluence and respectability. The usual extension is three months, but they may only give you a month.

Anyone with Israeli dual nationality is required to use their Israeli passport; the same applies for anyone with Palestinian dual nationality – Palestinian passport holders also require proof of Jerusalem residence or a permit to enter Israel or Jerusalem (but not to enter the West Bank via Allenby Bridge). You may be screened on entry into Israel. This involves a series of questions about who you are, where you are going, and the purpose of your visit. If you have a Muslimsounding name, or have visited Arab countries, you may get extra attention from the security services. If you are Jewish, and particularly if you have family in Israel, you are unlikely to be submitted to much questioning. Note also that Israeli stamps in your passport can cause problems when travelling on to Arab countries (see p.21).\n\nof the process at Wwww.ktalegal.com – click on “work visas” under “relocation to Israel”), but visas for study or for kibbutz volunteer work should be no problem.\n\nBASICS\n\nEuropean plugs, will probably also need one (easily available locally).

In fact, some travellers, particularly from the US, are visiting Israel specifically to have medical work carried out given its comparative cost at home. Israelis join a compulsory health insurance scheme but foreigners require their own health or travel insurance. No vaccinations are required, but it’s always worth being up to date with your\n\n01 Jerusalem Basics 17-44.indd 38\n\nIf you are taken seriously ill or involved in an accident, dial t 101 for an ambulance\n\nvaccinations before travelling. Mosquitoes can be a problem during the summer but they do not carry malaria.\n\nStomach upsets The only illness you’re especially likely to encounter is an attack of diarrhoea (shilshul in Hebrew, is-haal in Arabic). This may simply be due to a change in diet, but could also be caused by eating street food that’s been left out uncovered for too long. Be choosy and wash all fruit and vegetables and you should avoid an outbreak. If symptoms persist, and especially in the case of children, ensure that fluid levels are kept up: dissolving rehydration salts (available at any pharmacy) in water helps your body absorb it. Failing that, half a teaspoon of table salt with four of sugar in a litre of water a day should see you all right. For the duration of the bout avoid greasy or spicy food, caffeine and most fruit and dairy products. Drugs such as Lomotil or Immodium are only really only advisable as a stopgap if you need to travel. Jerusalem tap water is fine to drink, and bottled water is widely available anyway.\n\nHeat and dehydration Never underestimate the heat: it’s surprisingly easy to get sunstroke while sightseeing during the summer months. A hat is an essential precaution – the classic kibbutznik hat is ideal, and can be soaked in water for an extra cooling effect. Even a hazy Middle Eastern sun can burn fiercely so a high-factor sunscreen (available in Israel, but much more expensive than at home), is another essential item. Remember also to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. A potentially fatal hazard to be aware of is heatstroke. Signs are a very high body temperature without a feeling of fever, accompanied by headaches and disorientation/irrational behaviour. Lowering body temperature, with a tepid shower or bath for example, is the first step in treatment, but you should always seek further medical advice.\n\n18/06/09 11:36 AM\n\nWatch your step!\n\nMinor complaints can be dealt with at a pharmacy (mirkahat in Hebrew, saydaliya in Arabic). Pharmacists are well trained and usually helpful, and you will almost certainly find someone who speaks English. For more serious complaints, go to a doctor (rofei in Hebrew, tabeeb or doktur in Arabic); they almost all speak English. For emergency dental treatment call t 02/563 2303 8am–8pm (29a Keren HaYesod, but call first), with a doctor on call after hours. English-speaking dentists include Dr Samuel Abramson (12 Keren HaYesod T 02/623 4679) and Dr Elisha Reichenberg (2 Hillel T 02/645 2033). Opticians in the city centre include Optica Halperin (49 Jaffa Rd T 02/622 2228). There is always a duty pharmacy open at night and over Shabbat; a list is posted in all West Jerusalem pharmacy windows, but only in Hebrew; the Jerusalem Post prints a list in English.
