        "text": "Over the course of 25 years, the Toronto band Fucked Up have altered our time and space through an unlikely combination of having many, many great ideas, and a persistence that sees them through. Damian Abraham writes lyrics and sings, Mike Haliechuk writes lyrics, sings, and plays guitar (primarily), Jonah Falco plays drums, guitar, and sings, Sandy Miranda plays bass and sings, and, though its been a decade since hes been on a record, Josh Zucker has returned to play guitar in a studio (he sings sometimes too). Haliechuk produces the records.\n\nLike springtime in the Canadian prairies, Another Day is fleeting but buzzes with activityits Fucked Ups shortest album ever and arrives the most quickly after a previous album by the band. One Day emerged in the winter of 2023. Each band member separately recorded all their respective parts in a single, presumably rather cold day. Its a powerful document of a band known for elaborate, dense albums and (over-?) thinking everything through, instead letting go and trusting that theyd made the most of the time they assigned themselves to work with and against.\n\nIf One Day bore any traces of icy unfamiliarity, theyve thawed for the upbeat, energized and optimistic Another Day, whose songs were recorded in the spring of 2023. If you compare the track listings and listen to what is being sung, you realize that in sequence and in a thematic sense lyrically, the two albums are absolutely connected in a purposefully contextual and rather brilliant narrative alignment. So, like any parts of a bold series, theyre not the same, but theyre not completely different.\n\nThere's a lot of existential stuff in these songs, says Amos Lee. If you really listen to what's in between the lines, there's a lot of grappling with your place in the world, grappling with loss. There's a lot of grappling with the balance between bailing out the boat and rowing at the same timethe experience of writing music and playing songs while trying, as we all are right now, to make sense of a world that feels like it's changing really quickly. On his eleventh studio album, Transmissions, singer-songwriter Lee continues to expand his sonic range while sharpening his closely observed lyrics that squarely address death, aging, and love. The force behind such acclaimed albums as Mission Bell and Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song, ever since his gold-selling 2005 debut Lee has been known for his association with a long list of collaborators and touring partners, from Paul Simon to Zac Brown Band. For the new project, he craved a return to an old-school style of recording, working with his longtime band in a studio in rural Marlboro, New York that was built by drummer Lee Falco and his dad out of reclaimed wood from an old church (its exactly what youd think a studio in upstate New York should be, notes Lee). Playing live on the floor for long hours, in close quarters, they were able to capture the albums twelve songs in less than a week. I really wanted us to be all in the room, making music together, listening to each other and responding to each other, says Lee. In this age where you can do everything at home and fly it in, theres something really beautiful about getting in a room and starting at the top, the drummer counting in the song and everybody just playing. I would call it vulnerability.\n\n1xLP 180g Black vinyl - limited edition numbered pressings of 3,000.
