        "text": "Youssou NâDour\n\nAllmusic Biography : Some of the most exciting sounds to come out of Africa in the late 80s and 1990s were produced by Senegal-born vocalist Youssou NDour. Although rooted in the traditional music of his homeland, NDour consistently sought new means of expression. In addition to recording as a soloist, NDour collaborated with a lengthy list of influential artists including Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, Neneh Cherry, and Branford Marsalis.\n\nA native of the impoverished Media section of Dakar, NDour inherited his musical skills from his mother, a griot (oral historian) who taught him to sing as a child. A seasoned performer before his teens, NDour joined the popular group the Star Band de Dakar at the age of 19. Within two years, he had assumed leadership of the group, which he renamed Super Etoile de Dakar. With the band accompanying his four- or five-octave vocals, NDour helped to pioneer mbalax, an uptempo blend of African, Caribbean, and pop rhythms. Performing for the first time in Europe in 1984, NDour and Super Etoile de Dakar made their North American debut the following year.\n\nNDours talents soon attracted the support of top-rated musicians. In 1986, his vocals were featured on Paul Simons Graceland and Peter Gabriels So. He subsequently toured around the world as opening act for Gabriel. His greatest exposure came when he agreed to be a co-headliner, along with Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, and Tracy Chapman, on the Amnesty International Human Rights Now! tour in 1988. The same year, he performed at the much-publicized birthday concert for South African activist (and president) Nelson Mandela at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nNDour cemented his reputation in 1989, when he released his first internationally distributed album, The Lion, which included a tune, \"Shaking the Tree,\" that he co-wrote with Gabriel. Upon signing with Spike Lees Columbia-distributed 40 Acres & a Mule label, NDour scored a Grammy nomination in 1991 with his first effort for the label, Eyes Open. He continued to seek new outlets for his creativity, including an African opera that premiered at the Paris Opera in July 1993. Recorded in Senegal, NDours album The Guide, released in 1994, included his hit duet with Swedish-born vocalist Neneh Cherry, \"Seven Seconds.\"\n\nA steady stream of greatest-hits packages, reissues, singles, and even a few full-length records -- including a handful on Nonesuch, 2002s Nothings in Vain, 2004s Egypt, and 2007s Rokku Mi Rokka -- poured out during the late 90s and into the next century, featuring NDour working with artists from Etoile de Dakar to Gabriel. Egypt, which went on to win a Grammy, caused quite a cultural and political stir when it was released during the month of Ramadan. A documentary DVD centered around the whole affair, Youssou NDour: I Bring What I Love, appeared early in 2010 and included a biography of NDours career as well as extensive concert footage and film of NDour working on the Egypt project. The following year, he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in music from Yale University.\n\nIn 2012, NDour embarked on an unsuccessful run for president of Senegal. However, that same year he was appointed tourism and culture minister by Senegals then prime minister, Abdoul Mbaye. By 2013, he had returned to performing, although it took him several more years to return to the studio. In 2016, NDour delivered his 34th album, Africa Rekk, featuring guest appearances by Akon, Fally Ipupa, and Spotless.

The arrangements are tight, laden with horn riffs and keyboard flute loops. Aside from \"The Rubberband Man,\" all songs were penned by NDour himself here, and it is NDour that powers the album throughout with his vocals. With the exception of \"The Rubberband Man,\" all of the songs have a nice groove to them, with some outstanding vocal prowess soaring over the arrangements. The songs have the feeling which has come to be associated with his work, with simple grooves hailing both from Paris and Dakar studios, and his singing providing a focus. Any pre-existing fan of NDour should be pleased by this album, and those who are just looking to make inroads into Senegalese music wouldnt find this a bad starting point, although ImmigrÃ©s might be a more standard place to begin. Pick it up for a nice wander through the early sounds of one of the ambassadors of African music.

The record is propelled by talking drums, a horn section and guitar and bass polyrhythms that will sound familiar to fans of South African township music (or Paul Simons masterpiece Graceland), and NDours distinctive voice (in Wolof and French, with a smattering of English) is captivating. Unfortunately, The Guide is overproduced and seldom lives up to the promise of \"7 Seconds,\" the vaguely menacing duet with Neneh Cherry. Buy it to hear NDours voice soar through the history and lessons of The Guide.

However, slimmed down a bit by removing most of the duets (only \"This Dream,\" featuring mentor Peter Gabriel, survives the cut) and all the remixes, its definitely leaner and meaner. NDour has often been rightly accused of released watered-down albums for a non-African audience, but the addition of two Senegalese cuts, \"Miss\" and \"Madema (The Electricity Is Out Again),\" both fine examples of his hard Dakar mbalax style, show that Western audiences can readily accept the real thing. NDour himself might have lost a vocal step or two since the glory days of the 1980s, but he can still come in high and sweet with that remarkable voice, like a muezzin calling the faithful to prayer, and outsing most people on the planet. The band, too, is in superb form, with longtime bassist/arranger Habib Faye and outstanding bastion. The records at its best when its just NDour and the band, flying full throttle, with the tama drum chattering and skittering across the complex dance rhythm. When it slows up, as on \"This Dream,\" and programming becomes a part of the equation, somethings definitely lost, be it excitement or spontaneity. The exception is in the epic closer, \"Red Dirt,\" an eloquent plea for Africa, with NDour at his impassioned best. All too often, re-jigging an album is a sign of failure; in this case, its a sign of success. Album: 13 of 28\n\nTitle: Le Grand Bal Ã Bercy\n\nReleased: 2001-02-20\n\nTracks: 10\n\nDuration: 1:05:45\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nAllmusic AlbumCover 1 PrÃ©sentation Concert (Bercy) (00:53)\n\n2 Yarou (10:08)\n\n3 ImmigrÃ©s (06:28)\n\n4 Mbadane (05:30)\n\n5 Lang (07:44)\n\n6 Ligueye (03:02)\n\n7 Aziz (09:32)\n\n8 Please wait (07:26)\n\n9 Sama Dome (07:06)\n\n10 Dunya (07:56)\n\nLe Grand Bal Ã Bercy : Allmusic album Review : No one can accuse Youssou NDour of not putting on a good show. But he has two different shows, one for the Western audience, and another for Africans -- no matter where they might be. Recorded in Paris in 2000, this concert -- or at least concert excerpt -- was a recreation of his Dakar nightclub act: the full-on, no-holds-barred mbalax of NDour and Super Etoile. It was the best of the best, with few concessions to the fact that he had a new record out after several years, or that much of his new audience was Anglophone. The live setting also allowed the band to stretch out, turning the opener, \"Yarou,\" into a ten-minute tour de force, with the tamas offering their staccato, rapid-fire punctuation across the track, anchored by the melodic and rock-solid bass of Habib Faye. Every track is filled with sweat, however, with the band pushing further and further, and guitarist Jimi Mbaye unleashing some remarkable solos. However strong the band, though, its NDour, Senegals biggest musical name, whos the star of the show. And though he doesnt quite have the cataclysmic wail that was his trademark as a young man, he can still come in high, like a muezzin calling the faithful to prayer, and enthrall the listener, as he does on his classic \"ImmigrÃ©s.\" The pace does slow a little with the English-language \"Please Wait,\" whose sweetened ballad tones sound out of place among the frantic, relentless dance rhythms, but quickly picks up again for the closing one-two punch of \"Sama Dome\" and \"Dunya,\" leaving the crowd -- and even the person listening at home -- eager for a lot more. If you cant catch the man live, this is the next best thing.

Certainly his more recent studio recordings lack the urgency and energy of the material here, which was recorded in the early 80s when he was the frontman of Ãtoile de Dakar, before personnel splits left him heading up the new Super Ãtoile de Dakar and starting to make his first global inroads. The Cuban influence that had pervaded Senegalese music was still apparent at the beginning of NDours career, and it can be heard in tracks like \"Absa Gueye\" and \"Jalo,\" while the epic \"Thiapathioly,\" a big West African hit, shows the start of the transition to a more individual sound, the juddering, polyrhythmic mbalax, with its sabar drums cutting across the beat. By the time the last couple of tracks from the new band appear, the group had turned into a powerful, unstoppable outfit with NDours trademark high, keening griot voice the central instrument, since he was no longer sharing the spotlight with the two other vocalists, whod left to form Ãtoile 2000. As an insight into NDours relatively early development -- he was in his early twenties during this period -- this shows him gaining in confidence and ability, both as a singer and a writer, slowly nailing down the percussive mbalax style that would bring him fame and developing his charisma in front of a band.

Salif Keitas done it, and here Youssou NDours at it -- which proves to be no bad thing. His recent output has been quite schizophrenic, divided between albums aimed at a Western audience and those for his native Senegal, with the more hardcore mbalax sound that made him popular in the first place reserved for the African releases. While the easy melodies of Nothings in Vain (Coono Du RÃ©Ã©r) place it far more within the Afro-pop category than much of his previous work, its still a real gem, bringing in traditional musicians alongside his band, as on the opening \"Tan Bi,\" which works gorgeously, the harp-like kora intersecting with NDours rhythm section. The keening griot wail which has typified so much of his work is absent here, allowing for more subtlety of infection and tone. While that might be a bit of a necessity as he grows older, it also reinforces the fact that Youssou is one of the worlds great singers, capable of wrapping and communicating emotion in a note or phrase -- even if you dont understand a word of Wolof (or French, since several of the pieces, like his version of \"Il NYa Pas DAmour Heureux,\" are in French). And when he does break into English, on \"Look This Way\" and \"Africa, Dream Again,\" its not the ridiculous, gushing lyrics that have appeared on some of his more recent discs. Yes, there are too many lush keyboards for it to fully qualify as a true acoustic release, and the low-key tamas juddering across \"Yaru\" do sometimes make you wish the band would kick into high gear, but overall this is NDours most focused and accomplished disc in a long time. Maybe its a new path, maybe its a breathing space while he decides what to do next, maybe he just wanted a change. Whatever the reason, it works.

Perhaps the most popular pop culture figure in Senegals history, NDour created a music of his own from various sources, which he called \"mbalax\" and which incorporates everything from jazz, soul, hard R&B; styles, hip-hop, and even Cuban samba, and juxtaposes them with the folk melodies and polyrhythms of his native land. The cuts here, particularly \"Old Man,\" \"New Africa,\" \"Yo le Le, (Fulani Rhythm),\" and the covers of Smokey Robinsons \"Dont Look Back,\" and Lennon and McCartneys \"Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da,\" reveal NDours idiosyncratic, yet very accessible grasp and integration of Western and African pop styles.

Throughout his career, NDour has adapted his indigenous musical heritage to the pop sounds of world music. On Egypt, NDour and his quartet have created rhythmic and melodic arrangements for material from the Arabic world. Joining NDours quartet for this recording is the renowned Fathy Salama Orchestra, a 14-piece traditional music ensemble. The material is traditional Sufi music, and NDour has applied, via the scores director, Hassan Khaleel, Senegalese rhythms and folk melodies to exist in concert with the time-honored originals. The effect is nothing less than startling. NDour goes deep into the heart of Senegalese Sufism, tracing the lines where terrains, spiritual practices, and of course musical ideas meet, meld, and change. Unlike his previous recordings, the organic and sacred character of this music seems to stand outside of time and space; it wails and warbles, croons and groans. It is the music of joy and reverence and, as it bridges the various aspects of Islamic cultural traditions, one hopes it can create, via the sheer beauty of its sound and the translation of its lyrics, a portrait of a world that is far different from the one portrayed by Western media constructs.

Where Egypt was something of a side trip for NDour, a tribute to his Sufi faith, Rokku Mi Rokka takes on more of a mainstream melodic pop sheen, with an eye toward the northern desert country for inspiration. NDour, in addition to using his regular musicians, reunites here with members of his early-career Super Etoile de Dakar band as well as other players with whom hes been comfortable for years (gotta love Ali Farka TourÃ© sideman Bassekou Kouyate on the four-stringed ngoni), so the results are familiar and the groove locked in tight. Neneh Cherry, who performed a duet with NDour on 1994s hit \"7 Seconds,\" returns for a rap on the album-closing mbalax-funk anthem \"Wake Up (Its Africa Calling),\" which implores the Western world to stop taking Africa for granted and look to the continent for positive vibrations. The opening track, \"4-4-44,\" is a celebration of 44 years of Senegals independence, bathed in driving, repetitive keyboard riffs, a persistent rhythmic punch, and a midsong horn blast that provides a sudden Memphis-esque R&B kick. As always, much of NDours songwriting addresses tradition and its role in an Africa struggling toward modernization. There are songs of love and songs of politics and spirit. \"Tukki\" is little more than a simple paean to the joys of traveling, and \"Xel\" exhorts humans to do the obvious: use their brains and think. But then theres \"Sportif,\" with its drum lick right out of a New Orleans second-line march, whose sole purpose is to remind countrymen that theres no need to take it personally if a favorite wrestler loses a match -- its only a sport. Go figure. Nonetheless, Youssou NDour is never less than thoughtful and intriguing, and his voice is never less than gripping. Rokku Mi Rokka is another gem from an artist who has come to define the African music renaissance.

But with Dakar-Kingston, the hugely popular Senegalese singer Youssou NDour has managed to create a powerful new sound that blends the best aspects of his West African heritage (subtle and multilayered percussion instruments, heartbreakingly beautiful cascading guitar lines) with contributions by some of the best reggae musicians in the world (Earl \"Chinna\" Smith, Tyrone Downie, Dean Fraser, Bongo Herman, etc.). Alternating between English, French, and Wolof, he sings original songs that address social and cultural issues relevant to his homeland specifically, and to the African diaspora generally; he pays requisite and rather banal tribute to Bob Marley (\"Marley\" would have been less trite if it werent for the list of song titles it includes), and he celebrates the spread of African musical influences throughout the world. Theres some ska (\"Bamba\"), some excellent lovers rock (\"Black Woman\"), and a very fine adaptation of the \"sufferers anthem\" concept to particularly African concerns (\"Dont Walk Away\"). And at the very end, theres another Marley tribute, this one much more effective than the first: when you notice \"Redemption Song\" on the program its hard not to sigh. Does the world really need another moist and overly earnest cover of that inimitable Marley composition? But NDours version is different. Its not really reggae, but then neither was Marleys original; its a deeply personal statement rendered through another mans words in a musical style that consists entirely of preexisting musical elements that nevertheless add up to a unique musical result. In that sense, NDours version of \"Redemption Song\" can stand as a microcosm of this album generally.
