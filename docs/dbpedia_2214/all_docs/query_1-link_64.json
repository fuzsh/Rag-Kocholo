        "text": "We can probably use McDonough’s Shakey as a rough guide, here, as he had inside access and knew all about the finer details of the unreleased 70s songs, long before the rest of us.\n\nIf there were whole albums’ worth of entirely unreleased tracks from the 90s, we’d probably know about them by now.\n\nBut lots of interesting bits and pieces from here and there will quickly add up.\n\nAnd of course, Neil’s art often only really comes fully alive on the concert stage. His 80s and 90s performances are particularly accomplished, even when there aren’t whole hoards of unreleased songs.\n\nThe well-meaning-but-poorly-informed individual who writes off Vol IV based on it presumably having a lot of live stuff is still somewhat green; still in the very early stages of mutating from casual fan into super-fan/nutcase.\n\nShakey winds down at the end of the Briggs years, and finishes around the beginning of the early sessions that would later evolve into Silver and Gold, with the lawsuit not following until 2000 (hence the lyrics to Goin’ Home).\n\nSo it covers most of the 90s, with information about the long unedited version of the track Sleeps with Angels, the Dublin film ‘95, the planned sessions with Booker T following the ‘93 tour, the OPL gigs — and all sorts of stuff that wasn’t well known to most fans until the book came out.\n\nOverall, if we browse through Shakey, it turns out to be a pretty good guide for what turns up on the Archives sets.\n\n…for the 90s, I don’t mean it covers the period comprehensively, but it probably gives us a rough idea!\n\nTake the first single from NYA Vol. 3: Bright Sunny Day - recorded at Broken Arrow in a rehearsal for the Rust tour on a \"poor quality cassette\" (Doom & Gloom From The Tomb ). I think their are tons of such recordings even from the Vol. 3 period we don't know of. And if Neil used e.g. \"poor quality cassettes\" to record the composing of new songs their are tons of \"previously unreleased original versions\". Other examples: Neil even did video recordings while rehearsing, solo e.g. Without Rings - 1997-08-26 - Redwood Digital, Broken Arrow Ranch and with band e.g. Don't Let It Bring You Down - 2000-07-29 - w. Friends & Relatives - Rehearsal at Plywood, Broken Arrow Ranch. Both examples were made shortly available in 2000 on the old neilyoung.com website, but never made it to neilyoungarchives.com.\n\nYeah, I agree there's no way that he can fit 35 years into one box, not even if he expands it to be, say, 20 CDs. I also think '01/'02 is also a good place to end Vol. IV, as well.\n\nHowever, I don't have any confidence that, if they do eventually end up doing something like this, that there's going to be future volumes. The main reason is because I think Neil's decision is possibly influenced by Warner/Reprise. Meaning that they probably don't feel that box sets that cover anything post-early 2000s would be commercially successful enough to warrant making them. They probably see a Vol. IV box that will mostly cover his career comeback (and collaboration with Pearl Jam) as the last one where it makes sense for them financially.\n\nThis wouldn't be a bad start:\n\n1 - Bluenotes live album (one that'll complement the Big Room film like the Across the Water CDs will the film, and could also be 2 discs). Hopefully it'll include unreleased songs like \"Walkin' After Midnight,\" \"Find Another Shoulder,\" and \"High Heels.\"\n\n2 - Amazing Freedom (aka the tracks that would have made up the rest of the original Road of Plenty. So the Hit Factory version of \"****in' Up,\" the \"Sixty to Zero\" that was up on NYA as a sneak peek, the Times Square version of \"Boxcar,\" etc.)\n\n3 - Live Freedom\n\n4 - Raggedly Glorious (or a disc of Ragged Glory released versions, unreleased takes, and outtakes)\n\n5 - A Vol. III Sedan Delivery-esque disc that covers the Weld tour (hopefully would include the Buffalo version of \"Campaigner\" and compliment the Weld video, and possibly the Buffalo video)\n\n6 - A disc that covers Harvest Moon and MTV Unplugged (including outtakes from both) as well as some choice cuts from the '92 solo tour.\n\n7 - Deer Creek album and video (2 CDs potentially)\n\n8 - A \"grunge\" disc that covers songs and outtakes from Sleeps with Angels and Mirror Ball\n\n9 - Mirror Ball Live (also could be 2 discs)\n\nI'm still quite confident that Crime in the City from Freedom is an edited version from the full 60 to 0, even though Neil was unsure they had it. If said studio version doesn't exist, I'm fine with the live version from Toronto.\n\nWhat I suspect though is that we won't get it, but instead get the electric version. Which is a nice to have, but doesn't cut it against the acoustic version.\n\nUltimately there's 4 versions of interest, the full acoustic version, the electric studio version, the Jones Beach live version and the Weld version. I doubt we'll get all.\n\nI reckon there's definitely enough material to create a full Bluenotes Studio disc and then a live disc with highlights from Bluenote café and unreleased live stuff like 60 to 0 acoustic, Days that Used to be, Find Another Shoulder, High Heels, Walking After Midnight and Your Love is Good to Me.\n\nNeil wrote that they had two full, acoustic versions of 60 to 0, but he didn't like them.\n\nIt could be that. But at the same time, if there's an entire unreleased Bluenotes concert film, I think it will absolutely be in a Blu-Ray version of Vol. IV. And because of that, I could see them including a few more unique songs to make a \"Big Room\" album, including a few of the still-unreleased Bluenotes songs there, as well (especially if they're represented in the film). So in the end I think it'll end up somewhere between the zero new live tracks of SD and HJ, and the virtually all-new live tracks of ATW.\n\nI'd personally be happy if the Vol. IV has the live acoustic version and the studio electric version of \"Crime in the City.\"\n\n(also I'm personally a fan of the electric version. It's a bit repetitive in its electric format, but Neil's soloing and playing on it definitely makes it worthwhile).\n\nAlso, because why not, this is my best guess as to how a Vol. IV could be rounded out:\n\n10 - Broken Arrow tracks (and outtakes?), live tracks from Old Princeton, the Broken Arrow tour, and Trocadero, and the Rick Rubin sessions\n\n11 - a HORDE Tour compilation album\n\n12 - tracks and outtakes from Silver and Gold and Looking Forward\n\n13 - Wiltern '99 (potentially two discs?)\n\n14 - tracks from Toast and Are You Passionate?, and maybe some tracks from the two CSNY reunion tours\n\n15 - A Long Time Now - a live album of tracks from Crazy Horse's '01 European tour (again potentially two discs)\n\nAlso, I forgot to add that a Harvest Moon-era disc could also have a track or two from the '93 tour with Booker T & the MGs (including \"Live to Ride\")."
