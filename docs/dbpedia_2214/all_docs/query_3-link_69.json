        "text": "The Rough Guide To African Guitar Legends (RGNET1259CD) presents a range of dynamic finger-picking legends. Renowned Malian guitarists Djelimady Tounkara and Ali Farka Touré, whose music is based on a host of West African folk traditions, are each featured with a song.\n\nAlso featured in The Rough Guide To African Guitar Legends are Nigeria’s juju music innovator King Sunny Adé, Zimbabwe’s electrifying performer Oliver Mtukudzi, as well as Franco & OK Jazz, one of the key figures of Congolese music and African rumba. The captivating song by Syran Mbenza & Ensemble Rumba Kongo, ‘Tour A Tour’, is a tribute to Franco.\n\nEric Agyeman first gained notoriety as guitarist whilst pioneering highlife, an infectious dance music that is one of the century’s first fusions of African roots and Western music.\n\nThe late Shiyani Ngcobo was considered one of South Africa’s top maskanda maestros (a form of Zulu troubadour music), and added some rich vocal harmonies, and minimal percussion to his songs, best exemplified here by ‘Yekanini’.\n\nTinariwen’s music deals with common Tuareg themes such as homesickness, longing, exile and a new political awakening, which can be heard in ‘Imidiwaren’.\n\nJean Bosco Mwenda was a pioneer of Congolese finger-style acoustic guitar music and developed a swift technique of picking by using both thumb and forefinger, and Henry Makobi became one of Kenya’s most prominent guitarists by incorporating elements of the rumba, along with adapting the rhythms of the litungu (a traditional lute), into a style called sutuki.\n\nTrack List\n\nCD1\n\n01 Djelimady Tounkara: Fanta Bourama\n\n02 Oliver Mtukudzi: Andinzwi\n\n03 Ali Farka Touré: Penda Yoro\n\n04 Eric Agyeman: Nea Abe Beto\n\n05 Tinariwen: Imidiwaren\n\n06 Jean Bosco Mwenda: Pole Pole Ya Kuina\n\n07 Franco & OK Jazz: On Entre OK, On Sort KO\n\n08 Syran Mbenza & Ensemble Rumba Kongo: Tour A Tour\n\n09 Shiyani Ngcobo: Yekanini\n\n10 Henry Makobi: Omulanga Wamuka\n\n11 Kanté Manfila: Relaxin’ At Moribaya (Instrumental)\n\n12 King Sunny Adé: Ja Fun Mi Dub\n\nCD2 – Bonus Album by Syran Mbenza & Ensemble Rumba Kongo\n\n01 Heritage Ya Luambo\n\n02 Beyou Motema\n\n03 Liyanzi Ekoti Ngai Na Motema (Mouzi)\n\n04 Mbanda Nasali Nini?
