        "text": "26th June 2024\n\nIn recent years, some Japanese pop from the 1980s has been reclassified as City Pop as artists and albums by artists such as Tatsuro Yamashita, Mariya Takeuchi, Miki Matsubara and others have gained popularity around the world mainly through You Tube algorithms and vinyl reissues finding a new audience. Back in the 1980s though, CIty Pop was a little used term, instead different pop music of the day was categorised as J-Pop, Idol pop, Kayokyoku, New Music, Techno Pop and other styles. In chronological order, this is a show of some of the biggest hits of the 1980s, including some City Pop such as Anri and Akina Nakamori, but other styles that show the development of pop music through the decade with some of Japans most loved singers and musicians. Thanks to Miki in Saga, Japan, for the selection!\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n29th May 2024\n\nCurrently going through a bit of renaissance, through artists such as Minyo Crusaders, minyo, or Japanese local, regional folk songs, have always been modernised and updated going back to at least the 1920s when they were first broadcast nationwide. These tracks were recorded in the 1950s, 60s and 70s by some of the leading singers of the day including Hibari Misora and Harumi Miyako, known for singing other styles such as enka. Minyo tunes from throughout Japan mixed with various influences and styles.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n24th April 2024\n\nAll tracks are from albums whose front cover artwork were hand drawn or painted by Yasuo Yagi who died on 9th April. Some of the musicians whose albums he graced with his distinctive illustrations are by Japanese and Okinawan artists including Haroumi Hosono, Makoto Kubota, Zelda and Toru Yonaha, while others are from the rest of the world, from the USA, France, Italy and Sierra Leone.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n6th March 2024\n\nWith the continuing killing of innocent civilians in Gaza, demonstrations around the world call for peace and a ceasefire. In recent months there have been many new songs demanding an end to the killing, while older songs in support of a free Palestine have been given a new lease of life. Music and songs from Sweden, Japan, Ireland, England, Italy, Indonesia, as well as Israel, Palestine and the wider Middle East.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n22nd November 2023\n\nRare, popular 1980s and 90s music from Northeastern Thailand, or Isaan. Khmer Surin are ethnic Khmers of Cambodian descent living in Isaan. Much of their culture and language has been disappearing but has been kept alive partly through their music. This programme combines 1990s Khmer Surin popular music with music from one of Isaans greatest singers, Jintara Poonlarp, known for her style of music called morlam. This show features several now rare tracks from her early years in the 1980s and 1990s. Beginning with Jintara Poonlarp, her music and Khmer Surin are played in succession, one after another. While there are some differences, there are also many similarities between morlam and Khmer surin music.\n\nListen to this Show\n\n1st November 2023\n\nThree themes on todays show; first, the tragic situation in Gaza, with Japanese band Soul Flower Union and their song Palastina, and a collaboration between Japanese singer Mayumi Kojima and Israeli band Boom Pam. Secondly, Japanese boogie-woogie in the 1940s and 50s with tracks from a compilation album released to coincide with a NHK drama currently showing on Japanese TV about the life of the Queen of Boogie Shizuko Kasagi, and finally Halloween, with ambient music inspired by traditional Japanese ghost stories and a Korean gayageum cover of the Classics IV tune, Spooky.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n18th October 2023\n\nAll tracks are entirely by one of North Koreas most famous groups, Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble. North Koreas first electronic group, they play folk and revolutionary songs, with a range of musical influences, and different lead vocalists and composers. They have recorded 186 albums, dating back to the mid 1980s. Most of the recordings on this show are from the 1990s with some into the 2000s.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n4th October 2023\n\nThe earliest Korean popular music, made between 1925 and 1945, during the Japanese colonial period. Many songs were based on American and British music, and some Japanese songs were translated into Korean. Korean traditional and folk elements were also mixed into the music, while some lyrics expressed feelings against the Japanese occupation. Contains some of the most popular songs and singers of a time that remains a highly controversial period in Korean history.\n\nListen to this Show\n\n20th September 2023\n\nBack in the early 1990s, when 'world music' predominantly African and Latin music, was getting popular in the west, some Japanese producers, musicians and record companies turned to Indonesia for a southeast Asian example of a living and vibrant local roots music. These included dangdut, pop sunda and Jaipong. Record companies such as Overheat, Sambinha, Alter Pop, Audi-Book, Wave, producers and journalists, including Makoto Kubota, Katsunori Tanaka, Kensuke Shiina, OTO and Toyo Nakamura, recorded and promoted singers such as Elvy Sukaesih, Waldjinah and Detty Kurnia, while Japanese artists including Sandii, Uminosachi and Hideo Inoura played their own version of Indonesian music. Wave records released British musician Colin Bass aka Sabah Habas Mustapha's Indonesian hit song, Denpasar Moon, but soon Piranha, Riverboat, GlobeStyle and other companies began to release some of these wonderful recordings worldwide.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n28th June 2023\n\nGo Sato (Go san) who died on 20th June 2023, aged 71, was a mover and shaker of the Japanese music scene for the last forty years. As a music producer he was responsible for several groundbreaking hits. He had an ear and eye for talent, and was known for nurturing that talent, working with artists to achieve their maximum potential. But it was never about business or money for Go san, it was always about the music; a true music lover and visionary. This show features many of the artists he worked with during his time with the management and production company he founded called Five-D, from 1982 to the mid 2000s. Those artists include The Boom, Kazufumi Miyazawa, Shoukichi Kina, Heatwave, Kazuyoshi Nakamura, Super Butter Dog, Sayoko, Lisa Ono, Sayoko, Amika, Anam & Maki, HaLo, Hanaregumi, Zoombombs, The Privates, Goth Trad and Ai Jing.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n7th June 2023\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the 'People's Music' CDs and book, compiled and written by acclaimed journalist, Toyo Nakamura, helped define what the burgeoning genre of 'world music' was in Japan. Mostly vintage recordings from Asia, the Americas, Africa, The Middle East and Europe, featuring both well known and virtually unknown musicians from around the world. Many tracks are from Toyo's personal collection, some rare and unavailable elsewhere, including on this show from Brasil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cuba, Ghana, Egypt, India, Pakistan, Madagascar and Columbia. All three volumes that came out more than thirty years ago, are now released together with extra liner notes by Katsunori Tanaka, a disciple of Toyo Nakamura who has done much to protect and project the many jewels in Toyo's vast musical archive.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n17th May 2023\n\nJapanese or mixed Japanese musicians living overseas, many in Europe and others who have relocated permanently or temporarily. Plus some European and American musicians playing Japanese or Japanese influenced music. From some of Japans most famous artists to others big in the US, but relatively unknown in Japan and lesser known musicians, all with their unique take on Japanese music.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n12th April 2023\n\nSpring is an important time in Japan. A time of renewal and hope, signified by cherry blossoms, sakura. Almost a national obsession, forecasts for when the sakura will be at their peak are issued for everywhere in Japan, with people viewing the cherry blossoms or having a hanami party underneath a cherry tree. There are many famous songs about spring and sakura, both popular and traditional. This week features many of these tunes, nearly all instrumentals, played on a variety of instruments including ukulele, piano, harp, Afghan rubab, Chinese erhu, as well as Japanese traditional instruments, performed by both Japanese and foreign musicians. Plus other tunes about Spring by including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Akiko Yano and Kenji Omura.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n5th April 2023\n\nOne of Japans greatest musicians, Ryuichi Sakamoto passed away on March 28th aged 71. His enormous body of work encompassed electronic music, as a member of Yellow Magic Orchestra and on his own solo albums, plus other styles including avant-garde, experimental, traditional, roots, classical, famously composing numerous soundtracks, collaborations with musicians from around the world, and a producer/arranger for many artists. Far too many for one show, this weeks show focuses mainly on his solo albums from the last century, beginning in 1978 until 1998, and a couple of his songs performed by YMO. Most of the tracks are of his pioneering electropop style, with a few solo piano tunes including perhaps his biggest hit, Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence. Future programmes will showcase other diverse works in other other styles and genres from throughout his illustrious career.\n\nListen to this Show\n\n29th March 2023\n\nAkiko Yano is one of Japans most celebrated musicians. Still going strong, this show focuses on her career in the 20th century, beginning with a track from her first album, Japanese Girl, half of which was recorded in Los Angeles with Little Feat, and released in 1976 to her 1999 album Go Girl. Her music encompasses jazz and electronic with a pop sensibility, featuring brilliant piano playing and her unique vocals.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n9th November 2022\n\nHarp performed by Scottish, French and Canadian musicians playing music inspired or connected to the east, a Japanese harpist playing a tune from Spirited Away by Joe Hisaishi, a British musician playing an old German made zither, together with masters on various Asian zithers, including Japanese koto, Chinese qin, Korean gayageum, Vietnamese dan tranh and dan bao, and Indonesian kacapi.

A variety of styles and genres from rock and pop to jazz, roots mixtures, traditional and more. Flamenco was first introduced into Japan into the 1920s and has infiltrated Japanese music for decades, from the biggest pop stars of the 1960s by Teruhiko Saigo, the 1980s by Akina Nakamori, the 1990s by Ryuichi Sakamoto to the present day with Miyavi. Also includes flamenco guitarist Jin Oki, shakuhachi maestro Hozan Yamamoto, singer/songwriter Sachiko Kanenobu, the trio Spanish Connection, and zampona player Takamasa Segi. From the Spanish side, the massively popular Rayito, who is of Japanese/Gitano descent and flamenco singer Miguel de la Tolea.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n18th May 2022\n\nTribute to Japanese shamisen player, singer, taiko drummer and guitarist Tsutomu Tanaka who sadly passed away last week aged 48. A brilliant musician and a big personality, he will be missed by the many musicians and fans whose lives he touched. I included tracks by his group Chanchiki and duo Tsukudanaka Sanpachi (with Koushi Tsukuda) on two Rough Guide Japan compilations, and was lucky enough to go with Tsukudanaka Sanpachi to the Rudolstadt festival in Germany in 2012 where they performed. Listen to tracks of minyo (folk) and other roots music from his group and trio and a special live recording with musicians from around the world at Rudolstadt.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n11th May 2022\n\nMay 15th marks 50 years since Okinawa's reversion to Japanese rule from the US. Far Side Radio goes back to those times and before, with some of the biggest stars of the day, many mixing Okinawan traditions with pop, blues, soul, jazz and more, including several great Okinawan sisters groups, mostly originally released as 7 inch singles on the islands legendary local labels such as Marafuku, Maruteru and others.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n27th April 2022\n\nIn a similar vain to the French label Ocora, or the American Folkways label, there are two Japanese record companies who have travelled the world recording little known traditional, folk and ethnic music, JVC and King Records. Before the JVC World Sounds series, was the Super Ethnic series, recorded mostly in the 1970s and 80s. Many of these recordings were never released again, but remain documented treasures of often forgotten traditions. Here are 50 tracks from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Mongolia, Burma, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia. Both urban and rural recordings and traditions.\n\nListen to this Show\n\n6th April 2022\n\nI began presenting a weekly radio show 25 years ago on 6th April 1997. The programme was called Far East Radio, or in Japanese, Kyokuto Rajio, broadcast on FM Cocolo in Kansai. It was a two hour show, with musician Kazufumi Miya Miyazawa of the group The Boom, presenting the first and last 30 minutes, and me the hour in the middle. The show was produced by Boom's management company, Five-D, and a kind of scene developed around the programme playing other artists managed by Five-D and like minded musicians. Staff there started a dj event that became known as Tuk Tuk Cafe. Difficult to define, but essentially rock music with a punk attitude, melodic but not mainstream, sometimes with roots, especially Okinawan, and occasionally elements of dub or hip-hop. This is a show of some of these artists, including a few live recordings. Thanks again to Five-D for the first 5 years and to Resonance 104.4fm for the last 20!\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n16th March 2022\n\nBack in the 1980s and 1990s, musicians from the UK and Japan joined together on numerous projects from their mutual love and development of electronic music. Singers including Virginia Astley and Aztec Camera had albums produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto, who himself joined forces with Robin Scott (M), Holly Johnson (Frankie Goes to Hollywood) and David Sylvian (Japan). Meanwhile The Orb, The Shamen and 808 State all remixed tracks by YMO and Haruomi Hosono and Steve Jansen (Japan) became a long time collaborator of Yukihiro Takahashi, for whom he contributed a track for Takahashis tribute album. Plus Max Brennans remix of another electronic musician, Rei Harakami.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n2nd March 2022\n\nEvery now and then, playing music on the radio seems somewhat trivial without acknowledging an event that is consuming the world at the time. This week feels like that, so\n\nheres an hour of anti-war and pro-peace tunes from Japan and one from Ukraine. Several tunes feature Ryuichi Sakamoto, with David Sylvian, as part of YMO, his tune for Ukraine and a cover of his War and Peace.

So this year it felt time for a change! A soulful, jazzy, bluesy Christmas show with tracks from the 1960s and 70s, with absolutely no connection to the Far East whatsoever. Except perhaps for providing some inspiration.\n\nListen to this Show\n\n10th November 2021\n\nTribute to James McDonald, a long time customer and friend of Far Side Music who passed away recently. Apart from being one of the nicest people Ive come across, James was an avid collector of Japanese music and a fountain of knowledge especially about Yellow Magic Orchestra and the wider YMO family. Tracks from several CDs that James sent me over the years, including by Sandii, Sheena & The Rockets and World Standard, solo Haruomi Hosono, Yukihiro Takahashi and Ryuichi Sakamoto and extending outside to Japan with Martin Denny and Virginia Astley.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n20th October 2021\n\nIrish musician great Paddy Moloney of The Chieftains passed away recently.

The music from the southern islands was Japan's major contribution to the 'world music' boom happening around the world. The 'Big Three' of Shoukichi Kina, Rinken Band and Nenes all updated their local island music, while other musicians, including Tetsuhiro Daiku, Yoriko Ganeko, Ara Yukito Parsha Club, Yasukatsu Oshima and others all gained in popularity. Two tracks each from the 'Big Three' and other artists from what was a golden age of Okinawan music.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n28th July 2021\n\nPart 2 of Nighties and Noughties Japanese electronic, lounge, downtempo, bossa, future jazz and samba, part 1 of which was broadcast in March.

I was recently reminded that I was a guest a few times, and happened to come across a MiniDisc of my final appearance on 8th July 2001. The Rough Guides to Okinawa and Indonesia had been released at the time so most music is from these albums, with a couple of diversions to Okinawa's Shokichi Kina and Vietnam's Kim Sinh, the latter track ending up several years later on the The Rough Guide to the Music of Vietnam.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n28th April 2021\n\nA decidedly laid back feel to this week's show.

Follows a real journey and indeed a Saturday night I spent in Bandung in the mid 1990s. The trip was primarily to interview pop sunda singer Detty Kurnia, while I stayed at the house of the famous local musician, Nano. S. who had popularised pop sunda from the 1960s. I also visited Jugula studios to meet Gugum Gumbira, the originator of Jaipongan. Detty Kurnia and Nano S. both passed away in 2010, and Gugum Gumbira in 2020.

In Japanese, natsukashii is a kind of nostalgic feeling, but with a positive gratitude for the past. Christmas Eve meanwhile is the main day of Christmas, celebrated by couples who might go out for dinner or view the extensive Christmas illuminations. Most Christmas songs have a romantic, yet upbeat feeling. This selection is from the 1980s, with a few from the early 90s. All now city pop/j-pop classics.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n9th December 2020\n\nThe Far Side Top 10 new releases of 2020.

There aren't many record companies in Japan like Respect Records, and not many people like the indefatigable owner, Kenichi Takahashi. His personality shines through in the music he releases; at times joyous and uplifting, at other times sensitive and emotional. It was a pleasure to welcome him to the Resonance studio, to hear his story and listen to music from Okinawa, Japan, France, Hawaii and Sierra Leone.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 18\n\nOriginally broadcast on 23rd July 2014. Dutch musician Pascal Plantinga, has had a long and varied career from playing in punk bands to his own brand of experimental electronic pop music. After visiting Okinawa in 2005, he met the legendary Shoukichi Kina and his sister, Keiko at their club Chakra. Several years later he recorded with both of them on different projects. He came to the Resonance studio to tell us the story of how this came about and to play the music. Plus one solo and a couple of other tracks that inspired him.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 17\n\nOriginally broadcast 29th November 2006.

He was a guest in 2017 playing music and talking about his life in Tokyo. However, before he went to Japan, he was a guest on an enjoyable trawl through, mostly, Japan's ondo festival music in various updated versions including by his group at the time, Setsubun Bean Unit.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 16\n\nOriginally broadcast on 23rd September 2009. I met Rie Ogata just before she headed back to Japan having worked for the Asian Music Circuit in London. She came to the Resonance studio to play some of her favourite Japanese music. Although I had no idea at the time what she would play, it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable selection of some of Japan's most interesting musicians from the avant-garde experimental scene.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 15\n\nOriginally broadcast October 6th 2010.

I've long been a fan of the music of Sunda, Western Java, and of SambaSunda, going back to their first album as CMBW. Subsequently, they released albums overseas and toured around the world. Regularly played on Far Side Radio, it was great to welcome the leader of SambaSunda, Ismet Ruchimat, to the Resonance studio to play some tracks and talk about his music, and listen to some other sublime sounds from Sunda.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nThe Interviews Episode 12\n\nOriginally broadcast on 3rd June 2009. I've long admired Huong Thanh, travelling to Paris to see her perform live and interview her and her collaborator, Nguyen Le, for fRoots magazine.

There aren't many people in the music 'business' I like and admire more than Roger Armstrong of Ace Records. Always interested and interesting, a fountain of knowledge about all types of music, yet equally eager to explore new sounds he might not have come across before. Together with the equally admirable Ben Mandelson, they established the GlobeStyle label before the term 'world music' was coined. In 2005 he came to the Resonance studio to talk about and play some of his favourite music from East Asia, including Japan, Indonesia, Cambodia and Laos, with some beguiling stories behind the music.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nThe Interviews Episode 9\n\nOriginally broadcast on November 17th 2010. Earlier in 2010, I received an album by Maltese Rock. All written in Japanese, I wasn't sure what the group had to do with Malta, where this strange music had come from, or who they were. All I knew was I loved it. Six months later, miraculously, four of the group came to the Resonance studio, to play live, tell us about who they are, and where their musical influences come from. A few years later, the group went on to record more albums and play overseas concerts.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 8\n\nOriginally broadcast on 1st June 2011. Kuricorder Quartet is a quite brilliant, rather eccentric multi-instrumental group from Japan. Never in the history of music has the humble recorder, sounded this fresh and exciting, from the small soprano, to the giant great bass, via alto and tenor. Each member is a virtuoso on at least one other instrument, and together they create a rich, warm, polyphonic tapestry of sounds. On this visit to the Resonance studio they play live and each member talks about their varying careers playing for a variety of groups and solo projects.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 7\n\nOriginally broadcast on 18th May 2011. The series of interviews, during this period when there are no live recordings on Resonance 104.4fm, has so far featured guests who speak just about perfect English. Not all guests do speak English however. In fact there's nothing more I enjoy than a guest who comes to play live in the studio for us, while we have fun conversations in the English they do know, mixed with bits of Japanese, sometimes with the help of an interpreter. Isamu Shimoji is quite a big star in Okinawa and Japan, singing in his Miyako island dialect. It was a real pleasure to hear him play live, listen to tracks from his latest album and talk to him about his music and Miyako island during his brief visit to London.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 6\n\nOriginally broadcast on 3rd July 2013. Peter Barakan is a well known radio broadcaster in Japan, and presents Begin Japanology on NHK World. Originally from London, he went to Tokyo in 1974, and went on to work with Yellow Magic Orchestra during their heyday. However, it's as a radio broadcaster that he made his mark, presenting on Tokyo's InterFM and NHK. I was a guest on his InterFM show a few times, so it was a pleasure to invite him onto Far Side Radio during a brief visit to London. His eclectic tastes take in many genres and countries around the world, but for this, our version of radio ping pong (in tribute to Charlie Gillett) we concentrated on Japanese and Asian music, so it was good to hear his choices, as well as stories about working with YMO and the music industry in Japan.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 4\n\nOriginally broadcast 6th October 2004. Bob Brozman, who passed away in April 2013, was a guitarist, especially of National resonator, lap steel guitars and other stringed instruments. Aside from continuously touring the world and recording as a solo artist, he was fascinated by music and musicians from around the world, leading to numerous collaborations with artists from including India, Okinawa, Reunion Island, Papua New Guinea, Hawaii, Greece and Guinea, creating a family of like minded musicians. While on a solo tour of the UK, he came into the Resonance studio to talk about his music, and play tracks from his collaborations with Takashi Hirayasu, a rare live recording of Bob with Takashi and Djeli Moussa Diawara in Paris, some of his solo material and from Papua New Guinea.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nThe Interviews Episode 3\n\nOriginally broadcast 8th November 2006. I've interviewed Makoto Kubota probably five or six times, not just for Far Side Radio on Resonance FM, but for radio in Japan, BBC and fRoots magazine. Each interview has been really different, as we have focused on what he was doing at the time. And with Makoto, he is always up to something new and exciting, whether producing artists from Asia and around the world, or as the artist, or both, as on this occasion as we are mainly talking about his Blue Asia project (Thailand, Vietnam and Morocco albums) as well as older recordings and productions from Okinawa, Indonesia, Brazil and working with Haruomi Hosono. Recorded at the old Resonance studio on Denmark Street during Makoto's brief visit to London.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 2\n\nOriginally broadcast on 25th September 2013. I've interviewed Debashish probably three or four times, and am lucky enough to call him a very good friend. Interviewing friends can be a little strange but I don't think I could ever run out of questions for Debashish. A truly world class musician and an inspiring person, this was an unexpected interview arranged at the last moment, and hopefully I was able to delve quite deeply into the man, his philosophies on music and what makes him tick.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\nThe Interviews Episode 1\n\nFirst in a new series called The Interviews. Delving back into a rich archive of 25 years of interviews with musicians, producers, label owners and more. Originally broadcast 21st March 2007, episode 1 is an interview with Tom Hamilton, the leader of an Oxford University and Royal Geographical Society expedition, who set out to record and document the traditional folk music of remote Himalayan communities. At the time, Tom was hoping the incredible recordings made by him and his team would be released onto a CD, but almost inexplicably never did see the light of day. Meaning, this show was, probably, the only broadcast of these precious recordings. Listen to them, and the story behind the music.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n17th March 2020 (12th May 2001)\n\nMissed by many, Charlie Gillett passed away on this day, 17th March, ten years ago in 2010. He was always very supportive to me and many others. While I was living in Japan he didn't show too much interest in the music of Eastern Asia, but after moving back to London he was always encouraging and particularly interested in the various albums I was compiling. Artists too benefited from his exposure on the airwaves on London Live (as it was called then) and his BBC World Service programme. While visiting London in May 2001, I was his 'ping pong' guest, which was an honour. fRoots magazine were writing a feature on Charlie at the time, so fortunately Philip Ryalls took a photo which ended up in the magazine and elsewhere.\n\nListen to this Show\n\n11th March 2020\n\nSince the 1970s, Haruomi Hosono has incorporated various traditional and roots sounds from Japan and around the world into his own music. But he's also taken part in a large number of projects as bass player, producer, songwriter, singer, keyboard player and more, playing roots music from Japan and Okinawa, Balinese Gamelan, Brazilian Bossa Nova, the music of New Orleans, blues, Hawaii and more. Often hidden within the album credits, even ardent Hosono fans might not have heard some of these tracks. Plus, some bonus tracks for this upload! I forgot to bring a classic album from Okinawa that Hosono played Korg synthesiser on, didn't have time to play a pure Balinese gamelan track that Hosono supervised, and added the full version of a bossa nova classic that is so beautiful it was a shame to have to fade it down during the show.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n19th February 2020\n\nThe person behind the amazing Get Your Genki label out of Germany joins us via Skype from the Black Forest.

It's been inspiring to hear her develop her music with such a passion, open mindedness and bravery, in developing Okinawan traditional music, respecting the past masters, yet taking the music in totally new directions. It was therefore an honour and a pleasure to welcome her to the Resonance Studio. She enchanted us with her live studio performance, and listening to a track from her forthcoming and long anticipated solo album. Also featured music featuring her collaborator while in London, Mina, a track for October by the Boom, and the legend that was Hibari Misora.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n18th September 2019\n\nSubtitled, First Rumba to the Real Rumba, this is an extraordinary 2 CD set of Congolese music compiled from many rare 78s by African music collector and expert Yoshiki Fukasawa and released on the El Sur label. I was lucky enough to translate the extraordinarily informative liner notes and track notes for all 50 songs.

Verity Lane is an artist, composer, creative director and writer who lived in Japan for ten years. She draws on this experience, in particular her study of classical Japanese traditions, that she takes into new realms of possibility with imagination and originality. On her latest projects, Origami Soundscapes explores ancient symbolism and Japanese birdsong and features a large scale origami performance, while The Crane reimagines a folk story with elements of noh theatre, dance, avant-garde music and animation. In addition to talking about this, we play some of her previous compositions and music by Bjork and Clive Bell.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n24th July 2019\n\nWhat a pleasure it was to welcome Japanese DJ Yuka Mizuhara to the Resonance studio for the first ever Far Side takeover. Playing music all related to YMO, including solo tracks and rare treasures, her selections reflected her personality; effervescent, decidedly cool, of exquisite taste and utterly charming. Fascinating to hear of her connections to Tei Towa, the members of YMO, and tales of DJing at Hosono's concerts. It was wonderful to sit in the guest's chair and listen to her show unfold of tracks I had mostly never heard before.

Immersed in the traditional music of her father, uncle, aunt, grandmother, and other legendary Indian musicians, she has embarked on her own course of musical discovery, culminating in the release of her acclaimed album, Joys Abound. In this in-depth interview, we play one of her first recordings under the guidance of her father, Debashish Bhattacharya, to her latest foray, a rendition of a jazz standard, via tracks from Joys Abound and an interlude of Spain's greatest flamenco vocalist paying homage to his Indian roots.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n3rd July 2019\n\nNew, recent and re-releases with at least two themes going on.

This time, we concentrated on singer/songwriters with Hasiken performing live, and playing tracks from his most recent and first albums. Plus two tracks from the fabulous British singer/songwriter Lucinda Sieger, who Hasiken is soon to play with at her 'Lucie's Lounge' and has a cult following in Japan, and other classic tracks from Hiroshi Yamaguchi (Heatwave) Sachiko Kanenobu and the amazing voice of Thai singer, Rasmee. One of those shows that was a privilege to present.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n12th June 2019\n\nSachiko Kanenobu is about to have her classic album from 1972, Misora, re-released by US label Light in the Attic. 20 years ago she was in Japan to play some concerts as her album Sachiko was released. On 1st May 1999, She was my guest on Far East Radio, with an interview in both Japanese and English and playing tracks from that album. Plus other songs from Misora and other classic tunes from the early-mid 1970s by the artists Eiichi Ohtaki, Minako Yoshida, Chu Kosaka, Ryo Kagawa, Keiichi Suzuki & Moonriders, Masashi Sada and Kaguyahime, including some from the original vinyl.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n5th June 2019\n\nRock arrived in China in the mid 1980s, mainly through the 'father of rock' Cui Jian. His song 'Nothing to My Name' became an anthem for the protesters at Tiananmen Square, and Cui Jian joined them as one of the main figures of the Pro-Democracy Movement. Cui Jian inspired a number of other rock bands, with the rock scene reaching its zenith in the early 1990s. However, by the mid 90s, Cui Jian was banned from playing in Beijing. On the 30th anniversary of the massacre of the protesters, Cui Jian's most famous songs, including Nothing to My Name, a cover of that song and other rock bands and singers both before and after the crackdown, including Tang Dynasty and Dou Wei. Also news clips from the BBC, ABC and CBC chronicling the protests from April until its bloody conclusion on 4th June 1989.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n29th May 2019\n\nLewis Robinson of the record label, Mais Um, has long championed Brazilian music. Luckily for us, he has looked to the east for his latest release, with the superb Minyo Crusaders, and their reworking of folk songs with Latin, African, Caribbean and Asian rhythms and styles. Lewis talks about his label and how he came across the band, plays a few other Japanese discoveries and favourites, such as Monaural Mini Plug, Yasuba Jun Anchang Project and Churashima Navigator. Meanwhile I play a few tracks that Mincru have cited as influences including minyo/ Latin inspired tracks from the 1950s and 60s by Hibari Misora and Tokyo Cuban Boys, and other recent takes on minyo.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n22nd May 2019\n\nOn 21st May 1989 The Boom released their debut single, Kimi wa TV Ko and debut album, A Peacetime Boom. Tracks from The Boom to mark this anniversary plus on 1st May 1999, the four members of the band, Kazufumi Miyazawa (vocals), Kobayashi Takashi (guitar), Yamakawa Hiromasa (bass guitar), and Tochigi Takao (drums) presented a Boom special on Kyokuto Radio, Far East Radio, having fun and a few stories and thoughts on their first ten years. Listen to the first 30 minutes of this broadcast.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n15th May 2019\n\nAfter over 20 years of presenting a weekly radio show, something happened this week that hadn't happened before. A large segment of the planned show was to be played from an old Mini-Disc, and a combination of missing emails and a dodgy Mini-Disc player in the studio, meant with one minute to go I was faced with a one hour show with nothing prepared to play. A quick dip into my bag revealed a compilation album called Showa '64 that I bring every week (and is very good) as it contains the first part of the opening theme. Fortunately I had put a few tracks onto a CD for a Resonance colleague and played one track from an album intended for the original show. So here, hastily put together on the hoof, is this week's show.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n1st May 2019\n\nThe Uyghurs are Turkic speaking Muslims, the majority living in Chinas autonomous Xinjiang region, in the countrys north-west. Chinas President Xi Jinping has taken a hardline approach towards Muslim minorities living in Xinjiang, especially the Uyghurs. The government has installed sophisticated surveillance technology and Muslim minorities are being arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned. Its estimated around one million Uyghurs have been detained in what China calls 'vocational training centres', that resemble high-security jails. There is growing evidence of human rights violations inside the centres as well as reports of deaths in custody and forced labour. The regions name suggests the Uyghurs have autonomy and self-governance, but similar to Tibet, Xinjiang is a tightly controlled region of China. Tibetan identity is under threat, and many call for freedom, human rights and the return of the Dalai Lama.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n17th April 2019\n\nTracks from the recently released epic 4 CD box set, Non-Standard Collection. Founded by Haruomi Hosono in 1984, the pioneering Non-Standard label released Hosono's first post YMO recordings, including Friends of Earth, as well as albums by several other groundbreaking artists such as Miharu Koshi, Pizzicato Five, Mikado and World Standard. Selections from all four discs of mid 80s technopop, with funk, hip-hop and other styles, an influence that would permeate well into the 1990s pop scene. Includes a previously unreleased Hosono recording. All tracks on the set remastered, with selection and supervision by Sohichiro Suzuki of World Standard.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n3rd April 2019\n\nLike many Asian countries, music in South Korea during the 1970s, was heavily influenced by American music, including the protest folk of Bob Dylan and others. A music scene developed, especially around the US bases, with musicians performing for the US military as well as the local population. Some great singers and songwriters emerged including Shin Joong Hyun, who produced and influenced many others. Here's a selection of atmospheric 1970s Korean Psychedelic Folk, some with a Bluesy twist from this period. Plus two tracks of 1990s folk pop/rock and a recent track from Japanese/ Korean folk singer/songwriter, Pak Poe.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n27th March 2019\n\nThe 1970s were an incredibly fertile period in Japanese music. Jazz funk was a starting point for musicians such as Yasuaki Shimizu, Akira Ishikawa and Kazumi Watanabe, while a few others such as Terumasa Hino had embarked on a similar journey at the end of the 1960s. At the same time, a new movement started mixing jazz sounds and rhythms with traditional instruments such as shakuhachi, koto and shamisen, combining the talents of the leading traditional and jazz musicians of the day. These days, all of this music feels as fresh, relevant and quite simply cool, as it ever did.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n27th February 2019\n\nOur guests this week; Akinobu Tatsumi, otherwise known as TA2MI, is a Japanese Jodo Shinshuu Buddhist temple priest. He is equally at home performing ritual chants at his family temple or for ceremonies at people's homes, as he is beatboxing and combining his Buddhist chants and traditional instruments with electronic genres while collaborating with musicians from around the world. Neil Cantwell of Japan Sound Portrait, first 'discovered' TA2MI while making his incredible film KanZeOn, and is organising his UK tour. Exploring the relationship between Buddhism and music, are a few other tracks, and to end, a tribute to Burmese guitarist U-Tin who passed away on February 5th.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n20th February 2019\n\n28 years ago to the day, on 20th February 1991, Kazufumi Miyazawa of The Boom, visited the Himeyuri Peace and Memorial Museum in Okinawa. It was an experience that would lead to him writing the song 'Shima Uta'. Originally released as the 'Uchinaguchi' version in December 1992, then released as the original version later in 1993, it went on become one of the biggest selling singles in Japan that year. It would later be covered by artists from Japan and around the world, sung at least partly, in Spanish, Portuguese, English, Russian and Polish. This show includes the original, some of those covers and songs that might have influenced Miyazawa.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n30th January 2019\n\nTribute to Phil Stanton who passed away on 26th January. Phil founded Riverboat Records in 1989 and World Music Network in 1994. On Riverboat (and the Introducing label) he gave an opportunity to many artists, most previously unknown, playing hitherto unheralded music from all corners of the world, to release albums and develop careers. While with the Rough Guide series, he gave many journalists, DJs, broadcasters and others, a chance to indulge their passions and release their compilation albums, again often obscure, yet music with a story that deserved to be heard. All done with great integrity, passion and imagination.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n23rd January 2019\n\nOn a cold day in London, I tried to imagine I was playing records in a cafe in Thailand. Not sure if it was next to a beach, or in the middle of Bangkok, but a mix of moods, with pure recordings of traditional Thai instruments, and various contemporary takes on Thai music. From jazz, ambient and chill out to hypnotic roots music.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n16th January 2019\n\nIn the 1950s, musicians throughout South East Asia were influenced by various types of music and styles from other parts of the world, such as Latin, Hawaiian and Jazz. These were often blended with local styles to produce some of the most evocative music in those nation's history. Here's some of those tracks, plus at the beginning and end, a couple of songs reflecting the news of the day, and a few technical hiccups!\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n12th December 2018\n\nWe usually have at least two 'Top 10' shows every year, such as one for Japan and one for the rest of Asia, or one for new stuff, the other for reissues and compilations, but this year I ran out of weeks before Christmas! So all mixed in together, here are the Top 10 albums from the Far Side for 2018. Mostly new recordings and the different styles of music that reflect the Far Side catalogue.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n5th December 2018\n\nSome 25 years ago, I compiled an album for a UK record company tentatively titled OkiNOWa! the thriving music scene of the day. Unfortunately, due to various rights issues, it never saw the light of day. 25 years later, the Okinawan music scene is just as thriving and varied. Here's a just small selection of music that might be on such a compilation today, including some spellbinding unreleased tracks and remixes plus some recently re-released 1960s field recordings and 70s folk from Koza.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n28th November 2018\n\nInterview in his hometown of Chichibu, Saitama with guitarist Shin Sasakubo. There are some people who just seem extraordinarily talented, and Shin is one of them. A brilliant, classically trained guitarist, he plays avant-garde music influenced by Andean and his local Chichibu local folk among other styles. He's also a photographer and a tireless campaigner against further destruction to the sacred and brutally scarred Mount Buko which dominates the Chichibu landscape.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n21st November 2018\n\nMaking a welcome return to Far Side Radio this week, were the acoustic duo, Kuri. Katsu and Miho were guests back in 2014, and once again they entertained us with their wonderful music. Blending Asian and European music, various flutes and wind instruments, guitars and stringed instruments, percussion and vocals, into an earthy sound that reflects their passion for nature and the environment. Playing live, tracks from their album, and plenty of talk about the issues that lay at the heart of their music.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n7th November 2018\n\nI happened to be in touch in the last week, with two DJs from very different worlds, who I like very much. Jamie Renton has an ear for mixing infectious dance oriented world sounds, and is a tireless organiser of live music and dj events. Last week I was lucky enough to be part of the 'DJ Relay' at his birthday bash, and this week's show starts with a reprise of my short set. Meanwhile, DJ Bus Replacement Service (Doris Woo) is a Far Side customer and one of the few people who shares my interest in North Korean music - she deejays wearing a Kim Jong-un costume. We also seem to share a love of bizarre Asian pop. Asked for some further dance floor quirkiness are a few tracks that might fit her DJ ethos of \"I simply love playing bad and incorrect music at people for my own amusement.\"\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n31st October 2018\n\nWarning! On Halloween, this show begins with a loud scream, the track Osorezan (Ghost Mountain) from Geinoh Yamashirogumi. Things calm down somewhat with the full 18 mins of the world premiere of Coda for Glenn, featuring Ryuichi Sakamoto, then speed up again a bit with a medley of tracks from Cornelius (Oyamada Keigo), The Beatniks, featuring Yukihiro Takahashi, and two tracks from the remastered YMO compilation, Neue Tanz, although one is solo Hosono, before ending with an unrelated Halloween tune and Ryuichi Sakamoto from the 20 year anniversary of BTTB.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n24th October 2018\n\nThere's many things to admire about Hasiken. Most importantly, he's a lovely guy, but he's also extremely talented; equally comfortable playing his own songs on an acoustic guitar, playing a jaunty tune on the ukulele, performing a traditional Okinawa or Amami island song with his sanshin, not to mention an accomplished pianist too. He's also brave, carrying these stringed instruments around Europe, busking, playing a few gigs here and there, while keeping up an exhausting live schedule in Japan, and all with an infectious energy and a smile on his face. We were lucky enough to hear his stories and listen to him play for us live.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n10th October 2018\n\nIf I was to choose one musician, whose music I love but I know little about, and who would therefore make an ideal guest on Far Side Radio, that musician would be Yu Kyung-Hwa. I first heard her extraordinary album of chulhyungeum, slide iron stringed zither music, about eight years ago. I sent copies to various guitar musician friends in the US, UK, Japan and India and all of them loved it. Who knows, perhaps a collaboration might come out of it? When asked in a questionnaire on the K-Music festival in London in 2016, which artist I would like to see perform in the future, I wrote down Kyung-Hwa. Two years later, here she is at the Resonance studio, playing live, talking about her music and her project E-Do, who she performed with in London. Fate? Serendipity? who knows, but I felt very lucky and blessed to have Kyung-Hwa sitting in front of me. A special show for me and wonderful to see her artistry close up.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n26th September 2018\n\nIf there is such a thing as the 'Hosono Family' then Sohichiro Suzuki is perhaps his little brother. His career has been inextricably linked to Haruomi Hosono, who produced and released his first albums as World Standard, inspired his project Everything Play, recorded in the same studio and using some of the same instruments as on Hosono's classic album Bon Voyage. Suzuki has also collaborated with Van Dyke Parks, David Byrne among others, and now has a legacy of innovative, highly original recordings, inspired by Hosono and others but in his own indomitable style. In this interview in Tokyo, Sohichiro Suzuki takes us through his career with fascinating stories of his encounters with Hosono, David Byrne and others.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n12th September 2018\n\nShina Shihoko Nagai is a London based Japanese actor and musician, who has appeared in Rogue One: A Stars Wars Story and 47 Ronin among other films. Dipika Soni is a British woman who lived for a few years in a small town in Japan where she sang enka songs at her local snack bar and became involved in her local festival. I play some film based music, Shina talks about her career, and what it's like being an actress in London, Dipika her time in Japan and those snack bars, and both guests sing enka live in the studio. Together with Sarah from Resonance, we all demonstrate our chopstick skills and eat Japanese sweets, all filmed by a visiting Japanese TV crew.\n\nListen to this Show\n\n11th July 2018\n\nEvery now and then, Far Side Radio reflects what's going on in the news that week. And what a week it was! England were about to play Croatia in the semi-final of the World Cup in Moscow, the winner to play France in the final. Brexit was imploding with hard Brexiteers resigning from government , Trump was about to visit the UK for the first time, while 12 boys from a football team and their coach were rescued from a Thai cave. All these stories converged and were viewed through the unlikely prism of Japanese and Asian music- with Japanese / Okinawan/ Russian / French themed tunes and collaborations, plus a large dose of great tracks by artists from USA, Russia, France, Croatia and the UK!\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n27th June 2018\n\nInterview with the incredible Haruomi Hosono, plus studio versions of some of the music he played at his concerts in London and Brighton. The man who helped make the Hosono shows a reality, Matt Sullivan, whose label Light in The Attic are re-releasing several of Hosono's albums in the US and Europe, and put on the show in London, is the live studio guest to talk us through how this all happened.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n25th April 2018\n\nThe Vietnam war ended 43 years ago on 30th April 1975. The war changed East Asian music forever. American troops brought their music with them, local groups would play on and around the military bases in Vietnam, as well in Thailand, Japan, Okinawa and elsewhere, playing rock, funk and other styles. American music was blasted out on American Forces radio, further influencing local musicians, an influence that spread to neighbouring countries. This show contains music made during the Vietnam war in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia, together with news reports, AVFN radio, Presidential speeches, addresses and interviews from Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, all tracing the course of the war from the early 1960s until the fall of Saigon.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n11th April 2018\n\nSpring is celebrated in Japan like nowhere else. Perhaps the brief blooming of cherry trees symbolises the transience and beauty of life itself. At any rate, the Japanese love to sit under cherry trees at hanami parties and drink and sing. The theme of spring is everywhere in Japanese music, from classical and traditional to local folk, modern folk, enka, and pop, past and present. This is a selection of tracks for any mood with spring songs and tunes from across the musical spectrum.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n31st January 2018\n\nTen of the best new, recent or upcoming artists in southeast and east Asia right now.

All talented and creative. Music from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, Laos, South Korea, Japan and Okinawa.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n8th November 2017\n\nFrom the Far Side Radio archives, originally broadcast on 5th November 2003, Japanese koto player Chieko Mori joins Paul in the Resonance studio to play live and some of her other recordings. We also pay tribute at the start of the show to Japanese folk musician Kenji Endo who died on 25th October, and at the end of the show, Vietnamese slide guitar and stringed instrumentalist, Kim Sinh, who had just passed away.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n11th October 2017\n\nNowhere in the world is the quality of the recording and audio format more important than in Japan, where physical sales are still way ahead of streaming and downloads. These are recordings where utmost care and traditional recording values combine with the latest in technology in an attempt to realise the ultimate in sound. If terms and equipment such as 2 track/76cm/sec, 24 channel multi-recorder (Studer A-820) 192khz/24 bit, 5.1 formula, Shure SM-57, B&K 4006, CMC-52S/Neumann U-87 Aix, K2 Super Coding, rubidium electron oscillator, vacuum tube and Blumlein arrangement mean something to you, then this is for you. If not, then simply enjoy the pure live sounds of traditional taiko drums, shakuhachi and shamisen, the sonic architecture of Geinoh Yamashirogumi, Balinese gamelan, Chinese crickets, a festival, and from the US Water Lily Acoustics label, Ry Cooder and VM Bhatt. Even as an mp3 you might just be amazed.\n\nListen to this Show\n\nView Track Listing\n\n12th July 2017\n\n50 Years on from the Summer of Love. 1960s Psychedelia was heavily influenced by Asia, and then Psychedelic sounds went back to Asia emerging in a variety of music.
