Bonus CD: Saba - 'Jidka'

Born in Mogadishu to an Italian father and Somali mother, Saba has come to represent the meeting of African and European cultures. On 'Jidka' (The Line), her debut album, she explores the divide between Somalia and Italy with a rare sensitivity and gentle humour, mixing acoustic guitars and koras with traditional African beats and contemporary percussion.
