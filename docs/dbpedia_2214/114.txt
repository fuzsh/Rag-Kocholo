Description

This Rough Guide spotlights the front-runners of an explosive revival of African roots music. Listen to world-class artists, such as Staff Benda Bilili and the Bedouin Jerry Can Band, mix it up by infusing traditional sounds with the ultra modern, and by using ingenious homemade instruments, many of which are built from junk-yard materials. These are the sweet sounds of a movement which has not simply preserved, but truly reinvented musical genres with outstanding results.

The full-length bonus album from the Kenyan group Kenge Kenge provides an engaging exploration of the acoustic origins of benga and the Luo musical heritage. The music featured on this Rough Guide popularizes traditional music and simultaneously reinvents it. These are the excellently infectious sounds of the past, present and future all at once,
