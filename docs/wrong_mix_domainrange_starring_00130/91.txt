Rick Moranis is back, baby! The cast member of Disney+'s upcoming Shrunk film has made his triumphant return to acting...in a commercial for Ryan Reynolds' mobile wireless company, Mint Mobile. This is the second publicity stunt the Deadpool alum has pulled; in August, he launched his own streaming service, whose only option was 2003's Foolproof.

"It's hard to believe that Mint Mobile has gone so long without an unlimited plan, so to introduce it, we brought in an actor we've all gone too long without," Reynolds says in the ad, referring to Moranis' extended hiatus from acting.

The comedy legend (known for iconic roles in Ghostbusters, Spaceballs, and Little Shop of Horrors), left Hollywood in the late 1990s after the death of his wife to focus on raising his children. Like Reynolds, Moranis is also a native of Canada. In true Wade Wilson fashion, however, Reynolds didn't actually bring Moranis out of retirement to hawk a wireless plan â€” he just wanted to fan boy over him.

For Shrunk, Moranis will be reprising the role of Wayne Szalinski, the oddball scientist from the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise, which released three movies between 1989 and 1997. "If [the film] were made today, it would be made very differently, probably just with green screen and computer-generated stuff," he said during an interview in May.
