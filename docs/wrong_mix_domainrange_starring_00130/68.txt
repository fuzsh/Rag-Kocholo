In 1984, a group of rag-tag kids banded together to fight back against Soviet forces that had taken over their town and a third of the United States. In 2012, pretty much the same thing happens - only the enemy is now North Korea and Patrick Swayze has been replaced by Thor… er, Chris Hemsworth. And yes, this also happens to be the movie with Tom and Nicole’s son, Connor Cruise.

Sigh. This is another unnecessary remake, but in the case of ‘Red Dawn’, that doesn’t automatically equate to a bad thing. The film's concept is so strong and so choc-full of action and suspense that it’s kind of hard to screw up, remake or not.

This film was made years ago, pre-‘Thor’ and pre-‘The Hunger Games’, and it’s been sitting on a shelf ever since. One can only guess that the fact this film sports not one but two stars of two of the highest grossing films of 2012 helped it finally aquire a release date.
