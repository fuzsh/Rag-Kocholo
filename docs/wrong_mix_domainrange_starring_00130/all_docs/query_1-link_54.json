        "text": "(Jamie McCarthy / Staff/Getty Images)\n\nChildren of the 1980s & 1990s, rejoice! The one and only Rick Moranis, star of “Honey I Shrunk the Kids,” “Parenthood,” Ghostbusters,” “Spaceballs,” “My Blue Heaven,” and just about every other classic family film of that era is returning to the big screen.\n\nDeadline broke the news that the comedy favorite just closed a deal to return for the next “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” sequel “Shrunk.” The movie will be made for the theatrical side, not Disney+, and it probably won’t suck as much as “Honey, We’ve Shrunk Ourselves.”\n\nDisney was apparently hoping to keep a lid on Moranis’ return, but again, the people at Deadline f’d the whole thing up and spoiled the surprise for everyone. Way to go, Deadline! Bas*ards…\n\nDeadline is giving away plot points too:\n\nThe pic’s original director Joe Johnston will be back, with Josh Gad also starring. The movie centers on Gad’s character, who is the son of Moranis’ Wayne Szalinski, and is aspiring to be a great scientist like his father but accidentally shrinks the kids.\n\nThe 1989 movie Honey I Shrunk the Kids spawned Honey, I Blew Up the Kid and the direct-to-video Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. The first two movies collectively made $281M at the global box office (unadjusted for inflation).\n\nHoberman and Todd Lieberman are producing through their Mandeville Films and Television banner, with Todd Rosenberg writing the screenplay.\n\nIn 1997, Moranis stepped away from on-screen acting work to raise his kids but continued to do voice-overs in such films as Disney’s Brother Bear movies and The Animated Adventures of Bob & Doug McKenzie during the early aughts. With his upcoming appearance in Netflix’s Martin Scorsese-directed documentary An Afternoon With SCTV, he’s making a comeback, and what a way to do so with a cherished Disney classic franchise. That special was taped in 2018 at Toronto’s Elgin Theatre with Moranis joining fellow SCTV alums Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy, Catherine O’Hara, Andrea Martin, Martin Short and Dave Thomas. The special will be included in the Scorsese doc."
