        "text": "Raise your hand if you've wondered where Rick Moranis was sometime in the past 15 years. There should be a lot of hands up. The star of hit films like Ghostbusters and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids disappeared from the big screen in 1997, following the loss of his wife to liver cancer in 1991. Moranis realized that the life of an actor, always traveling, wasn't going to make raising his kids as a single father very easy, so he made the choice to be a responsible father first and essentially retired from acting altogether. However, it sounds like Moranis might be poised for a big return to the spotlight with a brand new album coming soon.\n\nMoranis hasn't been completely out of touch with the entertainment world this whole time. The actor provided his voice to the 2003 animated film Brother Bear and the straight-to-DVD sequel, not to mention \"The Animated Adventures of Bob & Doug MacKenzie\" featuring the characters from Strange Brew. In addition, about eight years ago, Moranis received a Grammy nomination for his album called The Agoraphobic Cowboy. And now Vulture points out he's back a new album called My Mother's Brisket & Other Love Songs, which you can pre-order on May 21st from Rick Moranis' website. Here's the cover art:\n\nSo why does this matter? Well, hopefully this means Moranis will be making the publicity rounds to promote this album. After all, his kids are much older by now, and what better time to return to the big screen? Ghostbusters 3 may or may not be in the pipeline, and the world can always use a little more Rick Moranis. This is coming from someone who had a childhood riddled with Moranis as a great character actor in films like Spaceballs, Parenthood, Little Giants and Strange Brew. And it's even better when he takes the lead in films like Little Shop of Horrors and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (this writer even enjoys the goofy sequel, Honey, I Blew Up the Kid). And there are countless others who feel the same.\n\nRick Moranis doesn't have the most expansive filmography, but there are few other retired actors who get brought up as often in conversation as he does. Hell, maybe his best years are still ahead of him and Moranis can get some kind of career boost like his Ghostbusters co-star Bill Murray following his Oscar nominated role in Lost in Translation. It would be great to see Moranis pop up in movies from Judd Apatow or Adam McKay, but a role in a Wes Anderson film or something like that would be amazing too. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. This is all just a pipe dream for now. But when Moranis comes out to play, let's all make sure he knows how bad we want him back. Thoughts?"
