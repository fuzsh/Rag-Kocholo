        "text": "despite all of his amazing movies, i think the thing i value most is his music. i don’t know what i would do without it. the music and lyrics and sound are all so uniquely him and what’s so important to me about his music is that it’s so obviously rick. i can find comfort in hearing his voice and smiling at his lyrics. i can have it close whenever i’m feeling down and i can always blast more upbeat songs of his when i’m happier! his music has benefited me so much over the months, weeks, days, and hours of my life and i can’t image what i would do without hearing his music each day. the comedy of his second album comes off as funny but also in a softer way, at least how i see it. it makes me feel “yellow” and that is something that i will always value. whatever happens, he’ll always be there, no matter what."
