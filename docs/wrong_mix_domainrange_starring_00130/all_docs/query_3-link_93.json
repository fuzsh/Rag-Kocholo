        "text": "Ghostbusters star Rick Moranis has revealed he turned down a cameo in the forthcoming female-fronted remake due to the flimsy nature of the part on offer.\n\nOriginal cast members Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts have all joined the cast of Paul Feig’s film, which will star Bridesmaids’ Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy alongside Saturday Night Live alumni Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon as the new quartet. Murray, who played parapsychologist Peter Venkman in the 1984 cult comedy and its 1989 sequel, will reportedly portray a professional supernatural debunker who stands in opposition to the new team, while the other cast members have either cameo or unspecified roles.\n\nMoranis played nerd accountant Louis Tully in both earlier films. But speaking to the Hollywood Reporter in an interview granted to address the furore over his absence from the film, the Canadian actor, 62, said he would not be returning for the remake.\n\n“I wish them well,” he said. “I hope it’s terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?”\n\nMoranis stepped away from the limelight for 18 years to raise his children after his wife Ann died from breast cancer in 1997. Until recently his Wikipedia page described the comic and actor as “largely retired”, but the man himself said that was untrue.\n\n“I took a break, which turned into a longer break,” said Moranis. “But I’m interested in anything that I would find interesting. I still get the occasional query about a film or television role and as soon as one comes along that piques my interest, I’ll probably do it. [But Ghostbusters] didn’t appeal to me.”\n\nSince Ghostbusters 2 failed to wow critics, Moranis has provided voice work for the 2003 animated movie Brother Bear, made radio commercials in his native Canada, recorded a 2013 comedy album and written opinion pieces for the New York Times. “Stuff happens to people all the time, and people make adjustments, change careers, move to another city,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “Really, that’s all I did.”"
