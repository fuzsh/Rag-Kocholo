Orange Wednesdays customers have selected the shortlist of five from a long list of eight determined by the award jurors. The winner will be announced at the awards on 12 February 2012. Previous winners include: James McAvoy, Eva Green, Shia LaBeouf, Noel Clarke, Kristen Stewart and Tom Hardy.\n\nLondon 11 January 2012. Today at BAFTA’s headquarters, Pippa Harris, award jury chair, Deputy Chair of BAFTA’s Film Committee and producing partner of Sam Mendes, announced the hotly anticipated nominees for the Orange Wednesdays Rising Star Award 2012 as selected by Orange Wednesdays customers from a long list of eight. The nominations recognise five international actors and actresses whose talent has captured the imagination of the British public.\n\nThe nominees are:\n\nOrange’s accolade for up and coming talent is the only award at the Orange British Academy Film Awards to be voted for by the public. Voting takes place both at orange.co.uk/bafta and via text\n\n. The winner will be announced at the star-studded Orange British Academy Film Awards on Sunday 12 February 2012.\n\nNow in its seventh year, the award has set a standard for identifying talent destined for super-stardom. Previous winners include James McAvoy in 2006, Eva Green in 2007, Shia LaBeouf in 2008, Noel Clarke in 2009, Kristen Stewart in 2010 and Tom Hardy in 2011.\n\nPotential rising stars were proposed by BAFTA members and leading film industry insiders to create an initial list of contenders who have appeared in one or more feature films, with at least one of those films released in the current awards year, 1 January to 31 December 2011. The jury for the award featured a raft of leading figures from across the film industry, including actors Simon Pegg and Sienna Miller, jury chair Pippa Harris, producing partner of Sam Mendes (Revolutionary Road, Jarhead), four-time Harry Potter director David Yates, producer Allon Reich (28 Weeks Later, The History Boys, The Last King of Scotland), casting director Nina Gold (The King’s Speech) and film publicist Kate Lee. These jurors whittled down the names to a long list of eight. These eight were then voted on by Orange Wednesdays customers, who have determined the final five that will now be voted for by the public.\n\nPippa Harris, Orange Wednesdays Rising Star award jury chair and Deputy Chair of BAFTA’s Film Committee said: “It is so important to involve the general public in helping us determine the stars of the future, which is why the Orange Wednesdays Rising Star Award is such a fantastic initiative. The jury had a tough job deciding the final long list, and we were spoilt for choice with such fantastic talent coming to the fore in 2011. I can’t wait to see who the public chooses as their winner.”\n\nSpencer McHugh, Director of Brand at Orange, said: “With the award now in its seventh year, we continue to be awed by how enthusiastic the British public are when it comes to celebrating future film talent. The fact that figures such as Simon Pegg, Sienna Miller and the rest of our esteemed jury so kindly offer their time shows how the film world has embraced the award.”\n\nThe Orange Wednesdays Rising Star Award was created in honour of Mary Selway, the highly respected BAFTA-winning casting director whose career spanned three decades and over ninety films before she died in 2004. She worked with notable directors such as Steven Spielberg, Roman Polanski, Clint Eastwood and Ridley Scott, contributing to the creation of some of the silver screen's most memorable characters.\n\nFor more information on the Orange Wednesdays Rising Star Award go to www.orange.co.uk/bafta\n\nTo vote by text:\n\nADAM DEACON text DEACON to 88080\n\nCHRIS HEMSWORTH text HEMSWORTH to 88080\n\nTOM HIDDLESTON text HIDDLESTON to 88080\n\nCHRIS O’DOWD text ODOWD to 88080\n\nEDDIE REDMAYNE text REDMAYNE to 88080\n\nTexts cost 35p plus a standard network charge.

Following this, he took to the stage in Christopher Shinn's new play, NOW OR LATER, showing at the Royal Court Theatre. He will return for the last performance at the Donmar in December 2011 as Richard II.\n\nTOM HIDDLESTON\n\nTom was born in London and grew up in Oxford, where he was educated at The Dragon School, and later at Eton College where, under the guidance of a group of incredibly inspirational teachers, his interest and involvement in theatre and film began to flourish. He remembers being taken, aged 14, to see Ibsen’s JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN at the National Theatre in 1996 – directed by Richard Eyre, with Paul Scofield, Vanessa Redgrave and Eileen Atkins – and being inspired and profoundly moved by both the writing and the performances. It was a turning point. Seven years later he would be playing Vanessa Redgrave’s son in the HBO/BBC Churchill biopic, THE GATHERING STORM.\n\nTowards the end of his time at school Tom applied to study Classics at Cambridge University, and was offered a place at Pembroke College, the alma mater of Peter Cook, Ted Hughes and Eric Idle. Before starting, in the summer of 1999, he played Captain Stanhope in a production of R.C Sheriff’s JOURNEY’S END, among a cast of his school peers, which they had put together with the sole intention of performing it at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a greater success than any of them could have hoped for. The Scotsman gave them five stars and the last line of their review read: “They just do not make ‘em like this any more”.\n\nIn his second term at Cambridge, he was seen in a production of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE by Lorraine Hamilton of the notable actors’ agency Hamilton Hodell, and was shortly thereafter given his first television role in Stephen Whittaker’s adaptation of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY (2001) for ITV, starring Charles Dance, James D’Arcy and Sophia Myles. During his last two years at Cambridge roles followed in two one-off television dramas co-produced by HBO and the BBC. The first was CONSPIRACY (2001), a film surrounding the story of the Wannsee Conference in 1942 to consolidate the decision to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The film prompted Tom’s first encounter with Kenneth Branagh who took the lead role of ‘Heydrich’. The second project came in 2002 in the critically acclaimed and Emmy Award-winning biopic of Winston Churchill THE GATHERING STORM, starring Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave. Tom played the important role of ‘Randolph Churchill’, Winston’s son, and cites that particular experience – working alongside Finney and Redgrave, as well as Ronnie Barker, Tom Wilkinson, and Jim Broadbent – as extraordinary; one that changed his perspective on the art, craft and life of an actor. It was then that he first thought of applying to drama school.\n\nTom graduated from Cambridge in the summer of 2002 with a ‘double-first’ honours degree and enrolled at RADA later that autumn. He graduated from RADA in June 2005, and within a few weeks was cast as ‘Oakley’ in the British independent film UNRELATED by first-time director Joanna Hogg. UNRELATED tells the story of a woman in her mid-40s who arrives alone at the Italian holiday home of an extended bourgeois family. She's the old school friend of the matriarch, but is soon distracted from the adults and drawn to the vitality and energetic escapades of the teenagers in the group, and in particular to Oakley. UNRELATED premiered at the Times BFI 51st London Film Festival in 2007 where it was awarded the FIPRESCI International Critics’ Award, and went on to win the Guardian First Film Award, the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for Joanna Hogg, and was nominated for the Evening Standard Best Film Award and the Critics’ Circle Breakthrough Filmmaker Award. It was also cited as the 21st best film of the decade by the Guardian newspaper.\n\nUpon his return from Italy, Tom met Declan Donnellan, artistic director of the award-winning theatre company Cheek By Jowl, and was cast as ‘Alsemero’ in THE CHANGELING by Thomas Middleton, starring alongside Olivia Williams and Will Keen. The production toured Europe for six months in 2006, and ran in the main house at the Barbican for six weeks. For THE CHANGELING Tom was nominated for the 2006 Ian Charleson Award, which recognizes exceptional classical stage performances by actors under the age of 30.\n\nIn 2007 Cheek By Jowl once again asked Tom to perform for them as the hero, ‘Posthumus Leonatus’, and the anti-hero ‘Cloten’, in Declan Donnellan’s production of Shakespeare’s late romance, CYMBELINE. The production toured the world for seven months in 2007, playing in New York, Milan, Paris, Moscow, Madrid, and in London at the Barbican. The Guardian praised Tom’s performance “The masterstroke of Donnellan’s production is to have both Posthumus, who comes to doubt Imogen’s fidelity, and Cloten played by the same actor, Tom Hiddleston. Remember that name, because one day the lad is going to be a star, and deservedly so”. The Sunday Times agreed that Tom stole the show “Tom Hiddleston plays Cloten as a snooty Hooray Henry, giving the outstanding performance of the evening”.\n\nLater that summer, Tom shot the period BBC drama, MISS AUSTEN REGRETS, about the last five years of Jane Austen’s life. He starred as John Plumptre alongside Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots, Hugh Bonneville and Greta Scacchi. It went a Writer’s Guild of Great Britain Award.\n\nIt was on the strength of his performance in CYMBELINE that Tom was invited to audition to play Cassio in Michael Grandage’s production of OTHELLO at the Donmar Warehouse, starring Ewan McGregor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Kelly Reilly. The play opened to extraordinary reviews. The Independent on Sunday said ‘McGregor is actually outshone by Tom Hiddleston a barely known newcomer and name to watch. His youthful Cassio is startlingly charismatic and dangerous in its own way, naively mixing professional duty with womanising’.\n\nTom was nominated twice in the category of Best Newcomer at the 2008 Laurence Olivier Awards for CYMBELINE and OTHELLO and won the category for his performance in CYMBELINE.\n\nIn 2008 Tom joined forces with Kenneth Branagh again to film the first series of WALLANDER, a BAFTA and Broadcasting Press Guild Award-winning and Emmy, Golden Globe and Satellite Award-nominated television series based on the detective novels by Swedish author Henning Mankell. In the same year Tom went on to star in the Donmar Warehouse/West End production of Chekhov’s IVANOV, again opposite Branagh, as well as Gina McKee and Andrea Riseborough.\n\nAs well as shooting the second series of WALLANDER in 2009, Tom also starred in the second series of the highly acclaimed BAFTA and Emmy Award-winning RETURN TO CRANFORD, starring opposite Judi Dench and Jonathan Pryce.\n\nIn 2009 Tom filmed Joanna Hogg’s second film ARCHIPELAGO, in which he plays the lead role, as well as the lead role of ‘Loki’, in Kenneth Branagh’s THOR for Marvel. In 2010 Tom filmed a number of projects including Woody Allen’s film MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, Steven Spielberg’s WAR HORSE, and THE DEEP BLUE SEA opposite Rachel Weisz. Tom has recently finished filming the highly anticipated feature film THE AVENGERS which is due for release in May 2012 and will begin shooting THOR 2 next year.\n\nOrange Wednesdays Rising Star Award full eligibility guidelines\n\nThe Orange Wednesdays Rising Star Award honours a young actor or actress of any nationality who has demonstrated exceptional talent and ambition and begun to capture the imagination of the British public as a film star in the making.\n\nNominees must have appeared in a film released during the current BAFTA awards year: 1 January to 31 December 2011.\n\nThe eight longlisted actors and actresses will usually have several film performances under their belt, in addition to one in the current year.

In exceptional circumstances, a star-making debut will be considered, but this will be the exception rather than the norm.\n\nAbout Orange UK\n\nOrange is the key brand of the France Telecom Group, one of the world's leading telecommunications operators.
