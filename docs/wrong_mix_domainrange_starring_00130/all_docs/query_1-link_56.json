        "text": "Ghostbusters actor Rick Moranis has been punched in the head in an unprovoked attack in New York.\n\nMoranis, who also starred in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Little Shop of Horrors, was walking near his apartment building in Manhattan’s Upper West Side when the attack occurred.\n\nA surveillance clip, recorded on Thursday (1 October), shows a man passing Moranis on the street and suddenly punching him, knocking the actor to the ground.\n\nMoranis, 67, took himself to hospital in the wake of the attack, where he was treated for pain in his head, back and right hip, police have confirmed.\n\nThe suspect remains at large, with the NYPD offering a reward of up to $2,500 (£1,900) for information on his identity.\n\nMoranis has largely retreated from public life over the last two decades, seldom appearing on-screen since the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.\n\nThe actor, musician and filmmaker, who was born in Ontario, Canada, rose to fame on the sketch show SCTV, before transitioning into movies.\n\nHis other credits include the Star Wars spoof Spaceballs and the 1994 live-action version of The Flintstones."
