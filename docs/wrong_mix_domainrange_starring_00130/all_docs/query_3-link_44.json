        "text": "The world missed Rick Moranis.\n\nNow, for the first time in more than two decades, the actor is coming back to the screen. He’ll be reprising the role of Wayne Szalinski, his unlucky inventor character from 1989’s Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, for a new Disney follow-up to that film, tentatively titled Shrunk, which will star Josh Gad as his son. Original director Joe Johnston (Jumanji, The Rocketeer) is also in talks to return for the sequel.\n\nAs news of the Moranis deal broke on Deadline, fans the world over released a collective sign of joy. The affection for Moranis can’t be overstated. For movie lovers, it’s like seeing a long-lost friend again. Sources close to the production say Gad (taking over the role of Nick, originated by then child actor Robert Oliveri) was especially insistent that Moranis be part of any return to the world of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. After intense back-and-forth to reach terms, Moranis finally agreed.\n\nThe geeky but lovable comic actor from Little Shop of Horrors, Spaceballs, and Ghostbusters walked away from acting in the late 1990s, and has resisted almost all efforts by filmmakers and studios to bring him back. His only public work has been occasional voice acting, like playing a moose in the 2003 Disney animated film Brother Bear, and an album of funny country songs in 2006.\n\nMoranis, now 66, became the J.D. Salinger of ’80s comedy stars: content to be left alone. His decision to withdraw came a few years after his wife, makeup artist Ann Belsky, died from cancer in 1991. She was only 35. Moranis had two young children to raise, and decided that his focus would be exclusively on them, and not on his career.\n\n“I pulled out of making movies in about ’96 or ’97,” he told USA Today in 2005 while promoting is comedy-songs album The Agoraphobic Cowboy. “I’m a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn’t miss it.”\n\nEven then, after only a decade away, he said he began rejecting most offers. “In the last few years I’ve been offered a number of parts in movies, and I’ve just turned them down,” Moranis said in 2005. “I don’t know whether I’ll go back to it or not.”\n\nAlthough his kids are now grown, his reluctance to get back onscreen has continued up until recently, when he was one of the only members of the original Ghostbusters cast to turn down returning for this summer’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife or the 2016 all-female reboot. But he has gotten closer to a yes each time. With Shrunk, it finally happened.\n\nFor a movie about making things small, this is a very big deal.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Why Eminem performed “Lose Yourself” at the 2020 Oscars\n\n— The Crown announces its new Queen Elizabeth II—and confirms its last season\n\n— Legendary Oscar winner Lee Grant on the blacklist, sex, sexism, and the treatment of Renée Zellweger\n\n— Hanging with Bill Murray on the set of Ghostbusters: Afterlife\n\n— Inside the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar party\n\n— There’s a blank space at the center of Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana\n\n— From the Archive: How director Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite marched toward Oscar night—and changed everything along the way\n\nLooking for more?
