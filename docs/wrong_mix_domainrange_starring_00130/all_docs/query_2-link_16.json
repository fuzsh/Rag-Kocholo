Twenty-five years later, a secret society obsessed with crime-solving called the Kill Club brings her in for questioning to discover the truth of the horrific crime.\n\nCannes 2012: Complete Coverage\n\nStephane Marsil’s Hugo Productions will produce the film in association with Peter Safran. The Paris-based Kinology, run by Gregoire Melin, will handle international sales, it said Tuesday.\n\nAdams, who stars in the Cannes Competition title On the Road, directed by Walter Salles, is repped by WME and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. She’ll next be seen in Rob Lorenz‘ Trouble with a Curve, Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master, and Zach Snyder’s Superman: Man of Steel and is set to produce and star in the film adaptation of Steve Martin’s novel Object of Beauty with Maven Pictures.\n\nPaquet-Brenner is repped by WME, Independent Talent Group and the Safran Company."
