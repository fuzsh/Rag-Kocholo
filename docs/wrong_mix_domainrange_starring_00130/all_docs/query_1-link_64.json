        "text": "Rick Moranis was spotted for the first time in over three years in the same city where he was randomly attacked in October 2020.\n\nThe “Ghostbusters” actor, 70, was photographed Tuesday braving the wet New York City weather in a blue jacket, dark khaki pants, black tennis shoes and a colorful beanie.\n\nMoranis has rarely been seen in public since Marquis Ventura punched him in the head, knocking him to the ground. The actor was walking on Central Park West around West 70th Street on his way to his nearby apartment building when the incident occurred.\n\nVentura was wearing an “I ❤ NY” sweatshirt at the time.\n\nHis rep at the time said the actor was “fine.”\n\nMoranis was spotted at Trader Joe’s on Broadway nearly a week after the altercation, and Ventura was later sentenced to two years in prison on several counts of assault.\n\nMoranis, who hasn’t starred in a live-action flick since Disney’s “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” in 1989, took a step back from acting in 1992 to focus on being a dad to daughter Rachel and son Mitchell after his wife, costume designer Ann Belsky, died of breast cancer.\n\n“I was working with really interesting people, wonderful people. I went from that to being at home with a couple of little kids, which is a very different lifestyle. But it was important to me,” Moranis told the Hollywood Reporter in 2015. “I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever. My life is wonderful.”\n\nHe also noted he wasn’t completely exiting show business as he never officially retired.\n\n“I took a break, which turned into a longer break,” he said. “But I’m interested in anything that I would find interesting. I still get the occasional query about a film or television role and as soon as one comes along that piques my interest.\n\n“Stuff happens to people all the time, and people make adjustments, change careers, move to another city,” Moranis told THR. “Really, that’s all I did.”\n\nHe last appeared in a 2018 episode of the ABC comedy “The Goldbergs.”\n\nBefore the attack, Moranis was confirmed to reprise his role as Wayne Szalinski in a “Shrunk” sequel, but the project was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project has since been put on hold indefinitely.\n\nThe Post has contacted reps for Moranis and Disney for comment."
