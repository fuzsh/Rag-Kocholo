        "text": "In Roland Emmerich’s new action film “2012”, the end of the Mayan Long Count Calendar brings a global cataclysm that threatens the survival of the human race. John Cusack stars as Jackson Curtis, an IWC owner who uses his Mark XVI pilot’s watch as collateral to secure seats on a small plane, saving himself and his family. Click this link to watch the wild ride that follows.\n\nIn this still from the film, John Cusack as Jackson Curtis offers his Mark XVI to board the airplane…\n\nThe watch that saves the day…\n\nCommenting on the partnership, Benoit de Clerck, President of IWC North America said, “In each of his films, and especially in 2012, Roland Emmerich has shown not only an impressive skill for story, but also incredible technical capabilities to realize the visual effects he’s envisioned. IWC shares his passion for innovation, precision, fine details, and craftsmanship, so we’re thrilled to play a role in the film and support its release.”\n\nApocalypse and sweeping special effects are Emmerich’s forte – he directed “Independence Day” and he produced “The Day After Tomorrow”. “2012” also stars Amanda Peet, Danny Glover, and Wood Harrelson. The film is directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser. The film is produced by Harald Kloser, Mark Gordon, and Larry Franco. “2012” opens November 13."
