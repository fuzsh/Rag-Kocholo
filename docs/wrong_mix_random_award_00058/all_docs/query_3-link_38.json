        "text": "It's day 10 of #blackhistorymonth and we are celebrating Angela Jackson, Illinois' current Poet Laureate. She has won numerous awards, including the Shelley Memorial Award of the Poetry Society of America, The Carl Sandburg Award, and Illinois Authors Literary Heritage Award. Her first book of poetry, Voo Doo/Love Magic, was published in 1974. Since then she has published multiple books of poetry, novels, and plays, which have all received the highest accolades in their categories. Her first novel, Where I Must Go, was published in 2009. This was a novel she had worked on for more than 30 years and had very nearly lost before she could publish it. At some point, she'd lost all of the disks on which she'd saved her entire manuscript. She ended up having to piece the novel together from various printed out versions that were hidden throughout her home. She took that Frankenstein monster of a manuscript and rewrote it, which I am sure took a wonderous feat of patience and focus. The moral of the story: Never give up! As Ms. Jackson is still alive, there's very little written about her but we know that she was born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised on Chicago's Southside. She graduated from Northwestern and the University of Chicago. As the Poet Laureate of Illinois, she has established four ambassadors to bring poetry to the masses. In this interview, she talks about what she does as Poet Laureate, what inspires her, and she reads a poem from one of her books. https://lnkd.in/gAQCPgSK\n\nDr. Margaret Walker, our poet for day 9 of #blackhistorymonth, was a keeper of stories and Southern folklore and a conscientious and deliberate writer, who used southern Black dialect and rhythm in her work. She has received numerous awards, including the Living Legacy Award by the Carter administration, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the College Language Association, and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Excellence in the Arts. Because her father was a minister and her mother a musician, she was well-versed in the classics, the Bible, poetry, and music before she even began her secondary education. Not only did she graduate from Northwestern University, but also, she earned a Ph.D from the University of Iowa. Her first book of poems, For My People, won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. She was the first Black woman to receive this award. Her first novel, Jubilee, has been baptized the first of its kind, as an historical Black American novel that advocates specifically for the liberation of Black women. It took her 30 years to write this novel, which she has said lends to its quality. In an interview, Dr. Walker said of Jubilee, \"There’s a difference between writing about something and living through it; I did both.\" Indeed, the novel is based on the story her grandmother told her about her great-grandmother. She meticulously researched every aspect of the Antebellum South, the Civil War, and Post-War eras, ensuring the authenticity of the narrative and voice of Jubilee. During the years she was writing, she got married, raised four children, taught full time, and earned her Ph.D, a familiar pattern for many women who do great things. Aside from her work, she also volunteered with the Works Progress Administration to mentor young girls in Chicago. She was also personally acquainted with Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps, and Sterling A. Brown, as well as friends with Richard Wright. She helped Wright with researching the case of Robert Nixon, a young Black man accused of rape in Chicago, which he used in his novel Native Son. In this interview by Mississippi Public Broadcasting, she speaks about style, influences, and morality, valuable lessons for aspiring writers and poets. https://lnkd.in/g5__MK59\n\nUp until today--day 8 of #blackhistorymonth--I've focused on critically acclaimed Black poets, but today I am going to talk about the most critically scorned poet of his time, Langston Hughes. You wouldn't know it by present standards, as Hughes is required reading during coursework on the Harlem Renaissance, but he received scathing reviews from critics. Headlines reviewing his work called him TRASH and a SEWER DWELLER, and these were Black critics. White critics described his work as \"Cassius Clay doggerel\" because it focused on everyday people and his verse was simple--rustic. But the critics' opinions didn't matter to the people. He was a poet of and for the people, a true folk hero, whose poems didn't shy away from the ugly and neglected. Hughes believed his purpose as an artist was to unapologetically express the experiences of Black folk in all their forms--the beautiful and the ugly--whether or not it pleased White people. Because of this, the people--not the critics--supported him, and he was the first Black artist to be able to earn a living solely from his writing and public lectures. What sets Hughes apart from many other artists of his day is how well traveled and experienced he was before he began his writing venture. He had worked as a truck farmer, cook, waiter, college grad, sailor, and nightclub bouncer. He had also widely traveled across Europe, Africa, and Mexico. All of this gave him a rather optimistic view of humanity. In his own words, \"most people are generally good, in every race and in every country where I have been.\" This optimism of humanity and his love of people shine through in his work. One of my favorites of his, which isn't typically in textbooks, is \"Daybreak in Alabama,\" which you can read at https://lnkd.in/gExeza3i.\n\nIt's day 7 of #blackhistorymonth and W. E. B. Du Bois, a controversial figure amongst controversial figures, is our focus. Before we get into his history, I want to highlight that he pronounced his last name \"Doo Boyz.\" We should respectfully do the same. Du Bois, who is a graduate of the HBCU Fisk University and Harvard, is most famous for helping establish the NAACP, being one of the leaders of the civil rights movement, and his collection of essays The Souls of Black Folk. He's most infamous for joining the Communist Party, vociferously rejecting capitalism, and his public tiffs with the NAACP. Because Du Bois was never afraid to push the boundaries and because he could do so while eloquently explaining himself, the U.S. government took measures to suppress him. Most notably, they denied him a passport and indicted him as a \"foreign agent.\" The Supreme Court had to get involved in order to get the State Department to issue him a passport once he was acquitted of the charges brought against him by the U.S. attorney general (a clear sign he was ruffling all of the right feathers). The Souls of Black Folk is a prime example of how much dust Du Bois could kick up. In this collection of essays, he speaks directly to White America about their role in and their duty to end the tyranny of White Supremacy. It was published in 1903--well ahead of its time--and was not well received. White readers were not ready to hear the accurate portrayal of their hypocrisy and brutality. Black readers were dismayed at his opposition to Booker T. Washington. What Du Bois does in The Souls of Black Folk is painstakingly review the history of the Civil War and the Reconstruction in order to illuminate the path we've been on. If you want to understand why we are where we are today, then this book is essential reading. We've arrived here simply by being on a path our predecessors chose long ago. Our only salvation is to make the radical and purposeful choice to get off this path. Though Du Bois did not publish many poems, there's a website that hosts the original manuscripts of his unpublished poems. \"Nina, My Dear\" is one I believe I have transcribed accurately. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.\n\nOn day 6 of #blackhistorymonth, we honor Nikki Giovanni, American poetess and Black Arts Movement icon. She has written more volumes of poetry than some writers have novels. I happen to have a copy of her Love Poems collection that contains the first ever poem of hers I read. \"I Wrote a Good Omelet\" was assigned to me in college. I can't imagine a better stage in my life than college to connect with this particular love poem. It's about the topsy-turvy feeling you get at the beginning of a relationship...the kind of feeling where you're so deliriously happy, you don't even notice that you're putting your shoes on wrong. Her rise to fame was through her poem, \"Ego Tripping.\" She explains in her 2017 Tedx Talk how she negotiated use of Birdland on a Sunday to do a poetry reading. The New York Times office happened to be across the street. When they saw a ton of Black folks lined up, they sent a reporter to find out what was going on. The following day, they printed her poem \"Ego Tripping\" on page 2. Aside from writing poetry, Nikki Giovanni also uplifts Black voices, advocates for voting rights for incarcerated people, and teaches. I am pretty sure she was friends with one of my teachers at Old Dominion University. I have a memory of her coming and taking over one of our classes and doing a poetry reading and workshop. I can't imagine a better instructor for a course on poetry. She advised us to believe in ourselves and to write. What I love about her is that she demonstrates her advice at every turn. Watch her whole Tedx Talk, especially if you're a writer or creator. You will see what I mean by her teaching method: It's Show & Tell. 💗 https://lnkd.in/gcM_4fr2\n\nIt's day 4 of #blackhistorymonth and I want to talk about James Baldwin, who lived through some of America's most tumultuous decades. He is most famous for his essays, short stories, and novels but he also had a collection of poetry that was published the year I was born. Even though I have been familiar with the name James Baldwin throughout my studies, I had only ever read his essay \"Notes of a Native Son\" in school. It wasn't until I watched \"If Beale Street Could Talk\" in 2018 that I was properly introduced to Mr. Baldwin, an openly queer Black man who wrote about interracial and homosexual relationships in his novels and stories. I recommend watching \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\" This movie has one of Regina King's most powerful performances. The scene between Reginia King and Emily Rios is the most honest and heart-wrenching portrayals of human suffering and trauma I have ever witnessed on screen. It gets to the heart of what Baldwin typically writes about, which is how messy and unresolved the reality of the human condition actually is. If I could sum up James Baldwin in a few words, they would be \"seeker and teller of truth.\" He was a proponent of not only telling the truth, but also seeing the truth. He believed White America's biggest mistake was refusing to acknowledge the truth of its own history and instead taking measures to soften and often omit things from our collective past. The danger in this would be that White people wouldn't heal from the trauma and guilt of past actions and would therefore continue to perpetuate injustice and harm. When I was growing up, I experienced this erasure of history in a 5th-grade social studies unit. We read aloud a few passages from our Virginia-state-purchased history books about slavery. In these passages, slaves were referred to as servants, happy, well-fed, clothed, and a part of the master's family rather than slaves. I remember questioning this with my teacher. I didn't buy it. I said to her that slaves and servants were not the same thing and that nobody could be happy being a slave. I'm pretty sure I got an F for that unit. Sadly in 2023, we are still seeing state governments legislate removing books, material, teachers, and history from the classrooms to somehow save children from the rigors of academic learning. By children, I mean White children. I have yet to hear of a politician speak to the trauma education might cause to a Black child. James Baldwin was speaking about all of this long before 2023, which is why he was also considered to be a prophet. I recommend reading James Baldwin's full poem, \"Stagerlee wonders\" to get an idea of what they are talking about. I'm thinking particularly about the lines \"the people moving, homeless, through the city,/praying to find sanctuary before the sky/and the towers come tumbling down...\" He died in 1987. Here's a link to the full poem: https://lnkd.in/g8DwjrAH\n\nIt's day 3 of #blackhistorymonth and time for Paul Laurence Dunbar, who was considered to be the foremost Black poet in America when he was alive (1872-1906). He was widely published and reached international acclaim for his dialectic poems, though he wrote essays, novels, and short stories, too. I first read Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem \"We Wear the Mask\" in college. It was completely detached from the poet, his history, or his experiences. I cannot remember the exact set of circumstances of this first reading, except that it was in a pile of poems printed out with no determining features. From that first line, \"We wear the mask that grins and lies,\" I felt that somewhere else in time someone else experienced themselves in the world exactly the way I did. I connected with the poet's description of hiding behind a caricature of himself in order to operate seamlessly in a world that expected him to be something he wasn't. At times, I would look out from behind my own mask and wonder if anyone else was pretending like me. Later on in life, I was speaking to someone about this poem and they told me something I didn't know. Paul Laurence Dunbar was a Black man only one generation removed from slavery and this particular poem was about society's expectations that Black folks always portray themselves as happy and grateful and never angry or sad--echoes of, \"Get over it already!\" Paul Laurence Dunbar was writing about how American society has always gaslighted Black society to undermine its valid emotional experiences, and required Black men and women to behave in a manner contrary to the trauma they had internalized for generations. The mask in this poem is just another layer of psychological trauma which acts as a veneer to generational trauma. This is what I love about truly great works of art: They peel back like onions. I made a personal connection with this poem and took away one meaning for myself. I learned more about the poem and the poet and was able to connect viscerally with the artist and his experiences. This is what poetry is about. It's about empathy and connection. It's about seeing yourself in a mirror and understanding yourself better. It's about seeing the world and society from a different perspective and expanding into new ways of thinking. This poem helped me recognize patterns of abuse like forced smiling. It helped me find better ways to listen to others. Most importantly, it has allowed me to absorb people's emotional responses without being triggered personally. All that to say, poetry can heal. 🖖"
