        "text": "The incomparable novelist and cultural commentator Toni Morrison, who died last week at the age of 88, never accepted the received wisdom about anything. In a publishing career that spanned half a century – from the appearance of the first of her eleven novels, The Bluest Eye, in 1970, to her last essay collection, Mouth Full of Blood, this year – she unfailingly cast in new light both aspects of human experience and moments in American history that, in our complacency, we thought we already knew.\n\nToni Morrison was born (as Chloe Wofford) in the depressed rust belt town of Lorain, Ohio, to a family of modest financial means and rich cultural and emotional resources. Her father worked as a welder at the nearby U.S. Steel plant; her mother was a key member of the African Methodist Episcopal church choir; her grandparents, who had migrated north from Alabama and Georgia, were a significant presence and influence. The music, storytelling and reading from the King James Bible that characterised Morrison’s childhood were to indelibly shape the values and aesthetics of her own writing.\n\nAs the first member of her family to go to college, Morrison attended Howard University between 1949 and 1953. She majored in English and minored in Classics, and she said was shocked by the segregation in Washington, D.C., and the colourism she encountered on campus. She went on to complete her MA in English at Cornell in 1955 and, after various teaching and publishing jobs, became a trade editor for Random House in 1968. Here, in the New York office, she reshaped the American literary scene by actively seeking out and promoting the fiction of black authors such as Toni Cade Bambara, Leon Forrest and Gayl Jones, and by editing the autobiographies of Angela Davis and Muhammad Ali.\n\nWhile this role afforded her some opportunity to work on her own fiction, Morrison would finally be able to focus on her on writing full time only after the resounding success of her third novel, Song of Solomon, in 1977. Focusing on the Civil Rights era of the 1950s and 1960s, this book is typically Morrisonian in its mock-heroic blending of Bildungsroman and epic paradigms, West African myth and African American folkloric wisdom. It is notably untypical, at the same time, in its focus on a male protagonist – the strangely-named Milkman Dead (names and naming were always all-important to Morrison) – and on friendships and family ties between men. The novel for which Morrison is best known, Beloved, was to follow in 1987; and her masterpiece, Jazz – underrated, perhaps, because insufficiently understood – appeared in 1992.\n\nEach of these continued the intense focus on individuals that both society and history have spurned or overlooked that Morrison initiated with her exploration of the psyche of the abused “ugly” black girl, Pecola Breedlove, in The Bluest Eye.\n\nChanging the past\n\nOne of Morrison’s favourite metaphors to describe her fictional project was that of the house and home. “If I had to live in a racial house,” she wrote in a landmark essay, “it was important … to rebuild it so that it was not a windowless prison into which I was forced … but rather an open house.” In this image, the “house” in need of rebuilding stands for many things at once: for mainstream American ideology, for the national literary canon, for the genre of the novel, even for language itself. The challenge Morrison set herself was to transform these flawed but powerful structures, and to create a better version of reality that she conceived of as “home.”\n\nFrom the very beginning of her writing career – from the early 1960s when she was working on the short story that was to become The Bluest Eye – she set out deliberately and self-consciously to create literature that was different from what had gone before.\n\nMorrison would write slowly, with great forethought and deliberation. She would rework her drafts until she was completely satisfied, and until the writing appeared “effortless.” The result was a dense, allusive prose that demands to be read aloud and that richly repays rereading and close analysis. Paradoxically, it is the complex layeredness of her writing that, on the one hand, makes her an obvious comparison with other innovators – such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Ralph Ellison, William Faulkner and Toni Cade Bambara – and that, on the other, ensures the uniqueness of her vision and of her voice.\n\nIn her foreword to Sula, Morrison describes her “sensibility” as “highly political and passionately aesthetic.” As far as she is concerned, aesthetic integrity and political effectiveness are inseparable, and to try to distinguish the way something is written from the influence it has is nonsensical and futile. When reading Morrison, it is essential always to bear in mind that the unifying impulse in her work – that of perpetually taking pre-existing cultural structures apart and revising, rewriting, re-envisioning or rebuilding them into new and better forms – is always and already both an artistic and a political process.\n\nTo state the obvious, the subject of Morrison’s writing is the African American experience. Put together chronologically (by subject matter rather than in order of publication), her eleven novels examine key moments of American history. While centring on late twentieth-century life, Love (2003), Tar Baby (1981) and God Help the Child (2015) also play with ideas of the continent’s discovery and colonisation; A Mercy (2008) opens up new perspectives on late seventeenth-century New England; Beloved (1987) has come to be seen as the defining literary treatment of slavery; Jazz (1992) deals with Reconstruction, black migration and urbanisation; and Paradise (1998) is simultaneously about the early twentieth-century phenomenon of the all-black town and the founding of the United States itself. The Bluest Eye (1970) and Sula (1973) epitomise small-town life in the depressed decades in which they are set (the 1930s and 1940s), while the action of Home (2013) and Song of Solomon (1977) is rooted in the fraught battles over racial and sexual equality that characterised the American 1950s and 60s.\n\nBut despite the primacy of history in these works, and the vital energy imbued by Morrison’s commitment to the disruption of white patriarchal “History,” the books are anything but conventionally understood “historical novels.” Morrison wrote of “the personal that is always embedded in the public,” and her way into political conflict and debate is always through the inner struggles of fully realised individual characters.\n\nMorrison once said that though she could not change the future, she knew she could change the past. The way she did this was to approach that past through the personal lives of those whom the dominant culture has silenced, erased, or forgotten: an unloved black schoolgirl in The Bluest Eye, the servants in a millionaire’s mansion in Tar Baby, a formerly enslaved mother in Beloved, women abused as children in Love. Unflinching in her attention to the brutal realities of innumerable black lives, the author attended equally to their creative resilience, and combined broad historical sweep with an intimate knowledge of the individual human psyche.\n\nCall and response\n\nIt is Morrison’s attention to the voices of the marginalised, of the “disremembered and unaccounted for,” that gave rise to the narrative structures of her novels. Rather than presenting a conventional chronological version of events told from a single standpoint, she combines multiple viewpoints or voices with disrupted chronologies and strategic withholding of information so that the picture is always evolving, always revealing something new.\n\nSometimes a voice in the first person opens a novel (for example, in Jazz or A Mercy). Other times an apparently authoritative third-person beginning lulls the reader into a false sense of security (for example, in the openings of Song of Solomon or Paradise). Morrison said many times that “the meaning of a novel is in its structure.”\n\nHer overt rationale behind her technique is to achieve a new kind of realism – to represent experience as we actually perceive it. But there is surely more at stake in her novelistic form than this. “I knew from the beginning that I could not, would not, reproduce the master’s voice and its assumptions of the all-knowing law of the white father,” she has said. Her dismantling of conventional narrative chronology and viewpoint is one of the crucial means by which she dismantles “the master’s voice.”\n\nA further effect of Morrison’s polyphonic, nonlinear methods is that they demand readers’ participation in the creation of meaning. That is why I have urged people not to read her recent forewords to the novels before reading the novels themselves, because to some extent they tell us what to think about the novels, and they diminish her prior insistence on active reading that is part of her political strategy.\n\nTo be participatory readers creates us as a community of readers, implicates us in events and also places Morrison’s work firmly within the African American tradition of “call and response.” Morrison spoke of her aim to create an author/reader relationship comparable to the protagonist/chorus relationship in Greek tragedy, to the preacher/congregation relationship in church, and to the soloist/group relationship in jazz.\n\nThe analogy between Morrison’s literary technique and jazz is by now well worn, not least because she has made it so frequently herself, but it is no less compelling for that. It is important to recognise, as well, that this is a comparison that has many elements to it and that each one clarifies a different aspect of Morrisonian style.\n\nOne level on which the jazz analogy works is that of audience and appeal. In a 1994 interview, Morrison pointed out that jazz music was at once “very complicated, very sophisticated … very difficult” and “also very popular.” She said she strove for her own fiction to encompass this duality: to “be as demanding and sophisticated as I want it to be, and at the same time be accessible in a sort of emotional way to lots of people, just like jazz.” This is something that in many ways she has achieved: in America she is a household name, and yet she has written some of the most demanding literature on the market.\n\nWriting about her mother in 2004, Morrison recalls, “Like the music that came to be known as Jazz, she took from everywhere, knew everything – gospel, classic, blues, hymns – and made it her own.” This would be an equally valid comment on her own approach to life and art: her novels are remarkable for the sheer breadth of literatures, traditions, mythologies and other cultural resources on which they draw.\n\nSome critics have tended to polarise their interpretations of her allusiveness. For example, it is not unusual to claim that the influences on her writing are somehow either “African” or “European” but not both, or that one cultural influence is more significant than the other. To adhere to such binary division, however; to insist that Morrison and her readers must make “either/or” choices, is simply to falsify the fiction. Morrison herself spoke of the limits of the “dichotomous double consciousness,” and of the attractions of a “concrete thrill of borderlessness,” and of “difference that is prized but unprivileged.” African, American, African American, Native American and European traditions are all synthesised, made her own, in her hands.\n\n“I’m already discredited”: the complexity of Morrison’s success\n\nAlthough Morrison was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, and although numerous other awards and accolades have followed, and although she is read, studied and revered in numerous languages all over the world, our sense of loss at her passing should not blind us to the fact that for far too long she was at once a celebrity and insufficiently acknowledged – particularly in the more conservative wings of academia and the media – as a figure of universal (as opposed to “minority”) significance. Even now, there persists some resistance to including her work on “high literary” syllabi, and a failure to recognise the extent of her contribution to intellectual history that both her fiction and her extraordinary essays constitute.\n\nThe way Morrison reclaimed (along with Paul Gilroy) modernism as primarily a black experience; her insistence (inherited from James Baldwin and exemplified in the dazzling experimentalism of her own writing) that any distinction between the aesthetic and the political is a false dichotomy; and her illuminations of the way colonialism and imperialism consciously fabricated African culture and history as irrelevant – these are among her greatest legacies.\n\nIn this respect, it is worth recalling that the story of Morrison’s career was one of numerous official recognitions which were met almost immediately with cynical responses and put-downs from some quarters. In fact, a pattern emerged whereby nearly every time she won an award, somebody somewhere would pronounce that the forces of “political correctness” had been at work – which is to say, that she only got whichever prize it was because she is a black woman.\n\nMorrison first gained widespread public recognition in 1977, after the publication of Song of Solomon. This novel won the National Book Critics’ Circle Award, won an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award, and was selected as a Book-of-the-Month Club choice. In 1980 President Jimmy Carter appointed her as a member of the National Council on the Arts, and after the publication of Tar Baby in 1981 she was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and she appear on the front cover of Newsweek.\n\nBut it was not until the publication of Beloved and the unprecedented levels of both critical acclaim and commercial success that this generated for Morrison that the controversies surrounding her really gained momentum. So Stanley Crouch’s wrote in a notorious review in the New Republic that Beloved was a “blackface holocaust novel” punctuated by “maudlin ideological commercials”; he described it as “protest pulp fiction” written by a “literary conjure woman.” Novelist A.S. Byatt, on the other hand, immediately described the book as “a magnificent achievement” and “an American masterpiece.”\n\nThough most readers seemed to side with Byatt, the novel did not win the National Book Award at the end of 1987. Enraged by what they described as “oversight and harmful whimsy,” forty-eight prominent African American intellectuals, including Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., wrote an open letter to the New York Times Book Review protesting this fact and attesting to Beloved’s worth. Two months later, in March 1988, the novel won the Pulitzer Prize. The timing of events enabled critics to say that the Pulitzer judges were pandering to the pressure of the letter, and the prize could never be seen as a simple recognition of achievement.\n\nPerhaps more troubling were the mutterings that surrounded Morrison’s winning of the Nobel Prize. Charles Johnson, a fellow American novelist and fellow African American novelist, described the decision as “a triumph of political correctness.” One wonders how exactly Morrison could be honoured, given who she was and the perspective of her fiction, without incurring this criticism. I am also tempted to agree with what she herself said in a 1994 interview:\n\nYou know, the term ‘political correctness’ has become a shorthand for discrediting ideas … What I think the political correctness debate is really about is the power to be able to define.\n\nBeloved continues to enjoy more accolades than anything else Morrison published. In the spring of 2006, for example, the New York Times Book Review asked two hundred prominent writers, critics and editors, of both sexes and of various ethnicities and nationalities, to answer the question: “What is the best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years?” Despite the obviously problematic nature of this question, the clear winner was Beloved. But the response to the judgment was depressingly predictable.\n\nAs quoted by the Daily Telegraph, Roger Kimball, co-editor and publisher of the New Criterion, announced that Morrison “is the perfect New York Times poster girl.” She was, apparently, “someone whose opinions and skin color immunise her from criticism and whose cliché-riddled, melodramatic prose imparts a hungry urgency to the tired Left-liberal yearnings of the paper’s cultural commissars.” The Daily Telegraph ran the story under the headline, “Anger as Literary Giants Lose Out to Slavery Novel,” and its reporter, Harry Mount, stated that “the 75-year-old black American edged out giants of modern United States literature such as Philip Roth and John Updike.”\n\nAs recently as 2006, the press of the British establishment still did not consider Morrison to be a “literary giant” or a match for Philip Roth and John Updike, and Beloved was referred to as a “slavery novel.” When John Updike died in January 2009, the eulogies in his wake were striking for what they revealed about who, at this time, was considered a “great American novelist.” Updike’s significance was continually compared to that of Hawthorne, of Mailer, of Roth, of Bellow and of Auster, but rarely to that of any woman novelist – and never to Toni Morrison.\n\nBy contrast, in her landmark study of American women writers, A Jury of Her Peers, Elaine Showalter made the following pronouncement about Morrison:\n\nBy the end of the century, Morrison was by no means a rural prophet; she had reached that peak of literary veneration at which she became the sibyl and priestess. Her majestic face alone was sufficient adornment for the covers of her books, and took its place alongside Hawthorne, Poe, Twain, Hemingway, and Roth as an American icon. The honor [of the Nobel Prize] accorded to Morrison surely raised the cultural standing of women’s writing in general as well as bringing about the canonization of her own work.\n\nI wonder, however, whether Morrison herself agreed that her job was so completely done. Speaking in Paris in November 2006, she talked about the fact that her books were not studied within many university English Departments in the United States. Of a large state university in Michigan, she said, “I’ve been on the syllabus in every department you can think of. In Women’s Studies, in African American Studies, in Community Studies, even in the Law Department. But never in the English Literature Department.”\n\nThe ironies inherent in her reception in Europe, meanwhile, are often greater still. At the University of Oxford, for example, which awarded Morrison an honorary D.Litt. in 2005, she was never recommended as a “special” (or set) author on the English undergraduate syllabus, while Derek Walcott, Philip Roth and Brian Friel occupied that position for many years. Arguably, she has always been better received in France than in the United Kingdom, and on 4 November 2010 she was presented with that country’s prestigious Legion d’Honneur. At the award ceremony, the then-culture minister Frédéric Mitterand told her:\n\nIn our eyes you embody the best part of America, that which founds its love of liberty on the most intense dreams. The one that allowed a black child born into a poor family in deepest Ohio, in the years of segregation, to have the exceptional destiny of the greatest American woman novelist of her time.\n\nEven here, however, Morrison’s status was qualified by the description of her gender, as it so often is by one of her race. The recognition of Morrison as a great writer who is an African American (and/or American) woman, rather than as a great African American (and/or American) woman writer; the acknowledgment of Morrison as a global cultural figure whose primary subject was the African American experience, is a process that is still by no means finished.\n\nWhile in adopting the role of “celebrity radical intellectual” Morrison had not chosen an easy row to hoe, it must in no small part be mainstream culture’s incoherence about identity politics, political correctness and the relationship between art and society that has forced Morrison into the “damned if you don’t, damned if you do” position in which she so often found herself. As she told the New Yorker journalist Hilton Als in 2003, “I’m already discredited, I’m already politicized, before I get out of the gate.”\n\n“It’s in your hands”\n\nNever resting on her laurels, throughout her professorship at Princeton, her Guest Curatorship at the Louvre in 2006-07, in her retirement and until the very end of her life, Toni Morrison remained profoundly alert to the way her books and essays were read, (mis)understood and (mis)represented. In her role as public intellectual and fearless social commentator, she was prescient about the racist violence that precipitated the Black Lives Matter movement, and prophetic about the regressions that the Trump-era has entailed.\n\nA recent documentary film, The Foreigner’s Home, depicts Morrison drawing parallels between the Middle Passage, the experience of black residents of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and the current migrant crisis. The very making of such connections, and the way she deploys her customary stunning oratory to expose uncomfortable truths about the nature of “home” and “homelessness,” epitomises all that will endure about the phenomenon that was Toni Morrison.\n\nAs Morrison insisted in her fiction implicitly, and in her Nobel Prize lecture explicitly, the future is “in our hands.” The power and the responsibility for making the world a better place lies not with the great artists whose passing we mourn, Morrison always maintained, but with ourselves – the readers and thinkers who have so much work still to do."
