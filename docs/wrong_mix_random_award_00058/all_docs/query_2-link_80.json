        "text": "“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” ~ Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nBack in 1926, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History group dubbed the second week in February, “Negro History Week,” the same week encompassing the birthdays of former President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, a prominent abolitionist movement activist. That later evolved formally into Black History Month as a national observance in 1976, and this month we celebrate the 45th anniversary of Black History Month here in the U.S.\n\nIn our mission to create an Earth beyond war and establish sustainable peace, we’re taking a moment to acknowledge a few of the many influential and empowering peacebuilders of the black community who have left an everlasting impact on the path towards a peaceful humanity. And while these individuals are recognized leaders in peacebuilding from previous generations, we recognize it’s impossible to list all of the global change-makers over time - and even today - who deserve to be on this list.\n\nWho do you see emerging as the world’s leading peacebuilders today? Who do you believe will make history in our current generation?\n\nUS Peacebuilders\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\nDr. King was one of the most influential peacekeepers during the civil rights movement.

A fight broke out on May 1, building up to the most brutal attack in Colombia’s 52-year conflict in which FARC guerilla forces bombed a church, killing 119 people. One of the people to survive was civil rights activist Leyner Palacios Asprilla. In 2014, Leyner co-founded the Committee for the Rights of Victims of Bojayá, which represents 11,000 victims of the Colombian conflict. For centuries, because of their poverty and isolation, the communities in the municipality of Bojayá had no voice. Leyner united all of the local communities under the common goal of stopping the violence and fighting for their human rights.
