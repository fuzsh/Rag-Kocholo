        "text": "In July of 1972, box­er Muham­mad Ali trav­eled to Dublin to fight Alvin ‘Blue’ Lewis, an ex-con from Detroit. In the days lead­ing up to the bout, he amused him­self by bust­ing on Fight of the Cen­tu­ry vic­tor Smokin’ Joe Fra­zier from afar, refer­ring to him on live tele­vi­sion as a “tramp” and a “slave” who lived on a “chick­en plan­ta­tion.”\n\nIt was a career defin­ing encounter for inter­view­er Cathal O’Shan­non, who praised Ali’s deft­ness in that area and not­ed that the champ said things “he would not have been able to say in Amer­i­ca.”\n\nIt’s doubt­ful that O’Shannon was refer­ring to the name call­ing, part of Ali’s cam­paign to draw Fra­zier back into the ring. (The champ got his wish less than two years lat­er, when he defeat­ed Fra­zier at Madi­son Square Gar­den in the sec­ond of their three fights.)\n\nWhat’s more like­ly is that O’Shannon was allud­ing to the orig­i­nal poem Ali recites from mem­o­ry, one minute into clip above, after ori­ent­ing Irish view­ers to the pre­vi­ous fall’s Atti­ca Prison upris­ing, still the dead­liest in U.S. his­to­ry.\n\nAli imag­ines him­self in the shoes of a black pris­on­er, respond­ing to the white war­den issu­ing a final ulti­ma­tum. His reply, which could be tak­en as a call to arms , but which Ali touch­ing­ly calls a “poet­ic poem,” takes the form of a dozen ter­cets:\n\nBet­ter far from all I see\n\nTo die fight­ing to be free\n\nWhat more fit­ting end could be?\n\nBet­ter sure­ly than in some bed\n\nWhere in bro­ken health I’m led\n\nLin­ger­ing until I’m dead\n\nBet­ter than with prayers and pleas\n\nOr in the clutch of some dis­ease\n\nWast­ing slow­ly by degrees\n\nBet­ter than of heart attack\n\nOr some dose of drug I lack\n\nLet me die by being Black\n\nBet­ter far that I should go\n\nStand­ing here against the foe\n\nIs the sweet­er death to know\n\nBet­ter than the bloody stain\n\nOn some high­way where I’m lain\n\nTorn by fly­ing glass and pane\n\nBet­ter call­ing death to come\n\nThan to die anoth­er dumb\n\nMut­ed vic­tim in the slum\n\nBet­ter than of this prison rot\n\nIf there’s any choice I’ve got\n\nKill me here on the spot\n\nBet­ter far my fight to wage\n\nNow while my blood boils with rage\n\nLest it cool with ancient age\n\nBet­ter vow­ing for us to die\n\nThan to Uncle Tom and try\n\nMak­ing peace just to live a lie\n\nBet­ter now that I say my sooth\n\nI’m gonna die demand­ing truth\n\nWhile I’m still akin to youth\n\nBet­ter now than lat­er on\n\nNow that fear of death is gone\n\nNev­er mind anoth­er dawn.\n\nThe poem draws to a close with an inex­pert but heart­felt sound effect.\n\nThe poet — whose mater­nal great-grand­fa­ther was born in Coun­ty Clare — went on to knock out his oppo­nent in the 11th round.\n\nThe trail­er for the doc­u­men­tary, When Ali Came to Ire­land, fea­tur­ing Cathal O’Shan­non, is below.\n\nMore poet­ry read­ings can be found in our col­lec­tion of Free Audio Books.\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\n\nMuham­mad Ali Plans to Fight on Mars in Lost 1966 Inter­view\n\nMal­colm X, Debat­ing at Oxford, Quotes Shakespeare’s Ham­let (1964)\n\nMail­er on the Ali-Fore­man Clas­sic\n\nAyun Hal­l­i­day is an author, home­school­er, and Chief Pri­ma­tol­o­gist of the East Vil­lage Inky zine.
