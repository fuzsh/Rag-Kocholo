The room would have a boxing ring in the center with six marble pillars surrounding it. Each of the pillars would be supporting the domed ceiling. The pillars would each have one of his core beliefs engraved in large letters on them: Respect, confidence, conviction, dedication, giving, and spirituality. The natural light from the glass ceiling would illuminate the pillars and their engravings. There would also be a glass case around the outside of the room that would hold every pair of boxing gloves that Ali wore, and it would also hold all of his trophies and belts.
