        "text": "Biography (AI generated)\n\nMuhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, was an American professional boxer and one of the greatest sporting figures of the 20th century. He became known for his charisma, boxing skills, and his outspoken stance on social issues.\n\nAli began his boxing career at the young age of 12, winning his first gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turning professional shortly after. He quickly rose to fame for his fast footwork and powerful punches, earning him the nickname “The Greatest”.\n\nOutside of the ring, Ali was an outspoken advocate for civil rights and social justice. He famously refused to be drafted into the Vietnam War, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the war. This decision cost him his heavyweight title and banned him from boxing for three years.\n\nDespite facing adversity, Ali returned to the ring in the 1970s and continued to dominate his opponents, eventually reclaiming his heavyweight title in the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” against George Foreman in 1974.\n\nThroughout his career, Ali faced many challenges including battles with Parkinson's disease, but he remained an icon in and out of the ring. He is remembered for his famous catchphrase \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\" and his legacy continues to inspire generations of athletes and activists.\n\nAli passed away on June 3, 2016, leaving behind a legacy of courage, determination, and activism that will forever be remembered in the world of sports."
