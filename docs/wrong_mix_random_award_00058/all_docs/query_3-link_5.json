        "text": "Muhammad Ali was a transformative humanitarian and peace advocate dedicated to improving people's lives, reducing suffering, and recognizing human dignity. He had the courage and conviction to make the world a better place, helping people worldwide to advance freedom, justice and equality. As a young athlete, before winning his first world heavyweight boxing title in 1964, Ali donated proceeds from his matches to aid people in need. Later in life, Ali promoted peace as a Goodwill Ambassador and United Nations Messenger of Peace. Throughout his life, Ali used his fame to shine a spotlight on suffering worldwide, to advocate for peace, and to amplify the voices of those unheard, particularly youth."
