While this could be true of most writers who won the prize at the zenith of their writing careers or had peaked in their writings, there are exceptions whose writings, at least in one of the genres they practice, surpass in creative strength their pre-Nobel achievements in that particular genre. Doubtless, some writers win the Nobel Prize toward the end of their lives or careers and might have gone into creative menopause. However, in recent times, Derek Walcott’s White Egrets has won the T. S. Eliot Prize, Britain’s most prestigious award for poetry, long after he won the Nobel Prize. Walcott’s collection of poems on ageing and dying is described as “a moving, risk-taking and technically flawless book by a great poet” (The Independent on Sunday, January 25, 2011)."
