        "text": "The Life and Times of Muhammad Ali by Thomas Hauser\n\nOne book on Muhammad Ali that covers pretty much everything? Hauser‚Äôs slightly weighty tome has got to be it. Hauser played Boswell to Ali‚Äôs Johnson in this title, talking to not just Ali but almost everyone he was associated with - parents, wives, trainers, journalists and of course, his rivals in the ring. The result is a book of astonishing detail with a wealth of conversation. And although an ‚Äòofficial‚Äô biography, it is amazingly objective‚ÄîHauser does not try to airbrush Ali‚Äôs failings but states them up front.\n\nMuhammad Ali by Don Atyeo and Felix Denis\n\nFor those who want a more ‚Äòvisual‚Äô narration of Muhammad Ali‚Äôs career, this is the book. Atyeo and Dennis cover each of his bouts, blending some very good text with brilliant photography. The attention paid to his personal life is not quite as detailed but boxing lovers will just love the manner in which the duo capture every fight--the entire chapter devoted to the fight against Foreman is an absolute classic. Sports writing at its best, we think.\n\nThe King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero by David Remnick\n\nIf you are looking for a classic biography, then this is not it. For Remnick (the man who gave us the brilliant Lenin‚Äôs Tomb) mainly focuses on Ali‚Äôs life from his Olympic victory to his second fight with Sonny Liston in this book. It might seem a relatively small period--slightly more than half a decade‚Äîbut it was a time which witnessed Ali win the Olympics, become a contender, win the heavyweight title against all odds, and then surprise everyone by converting to Islam. This is the story of the man Ali became, and is compulsively readable not just for the boxing but for the relationships and friendships that Ali got in and out of in this turbulent period, not just for the sport, but for the world. The book could also be titled How Cassius Clay Became Muhammad Ali. Superb writing.\n\nThe Fight by Norman Mailer\n\nThere are many who consider this to be the single greatest book ever written on any sport. And with good reason‚Äîit is written by the redoubtable Norman Mailer at the peak of his powers and covers perhaps the most important fight in Ali‚Äôs career, the bout against George Foreman in Zaire in 1974. No one gave Ali a chance against Foreman, who was supposed to be virtually unbeatable, not to mention indestructible. Ali, of course, stunned the world with a whole new strategy (one he christened Rope a Dope), winning back the heavyweight title. This is the story of the fight, told by one of the greatest authors of our time. Mailer had complete access to Ali, Foreman, their trainers and followers, and he roamed Zaire, picking up vibes of the bout. The result is part sports book, part fight report, part travelogue and part biography.\n\nShadow Box: An Amateur in the Ring by George Plimptom\n\nThere will be those who will be wondering what this book is doing in this list - it is not about Ali, and is actually about legendary writer George Plimpton‚Äôs experiences of boxing, including an actual bout with boxing great Archie Moore. Well, the reason is that while this is not a book devoted to Ali, the Greatest flits in and out of its pages, writing poems with a literary figure, playing pranks and finally, pulling of a mighty upset at the very end. Rarely has so much been revealed about a person in so few pages. Do grab a copy of Mailer‚Äôs The Fight (also in this list) to read side by side, as Mailer and Plimpton were companions during the Foreman fight Zaire and it is fun to read their perceptions of the fight - Mailer actually screamed ‚Äúit‚Äôs a fix\" early in the fight!\n\nAli vs Superman by Dennis O‚ÄôNeil and Neal Adams\n\nYes, this was a comic strip. And no, it was not a great comic strip by any standards, let alone modern ‚Äògraphic novel‚Äô ones but if one book captures the sheer stature of Ali, it is this one. Not too many sports figures have made it into a super hero comic strip. Ali did. Against the last son of Krypton, no less. And oh yes, he more than held his own. It remains one of the most famous Superman comics of all time.\n\nThe Greatest: My Own Story by Muhammad Ali\n\nIt was a book that promised a lot but in the end delivered relatively little. Yes, Muhammad Ali did write his autobiography (shortly after his third, brutal fight with Joe Frazier) but by most accounts, it was so heavily tweaked by his religious mentors that the final product was a little disappointing by Ali standards, notwithstanding the involvement of Nobel Prize winning author Toni Morrison. It nevertheless is essential reading for anyone who wants to get into the ‚Äòhead‚Äô of Muhammad Al, as it is the closest thing we have to his story in his own words - he talks about women, clothes, marriage, losing his virginity, and of course, boxing. Read it just for the ten page conversation he has while driving in a car with the man who would become his bete noir, Joe Frazier!\n\nMilestone Alert!
