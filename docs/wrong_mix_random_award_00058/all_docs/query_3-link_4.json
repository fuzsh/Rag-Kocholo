        "text": "Elie Wiesel (born September 30, 1928, Sighet, Romania—died July 2, 2016, New York, New York, U.S.) was a Romanian-born Jewish writer, whose works provide a sober yet passionate testament of the destruction of European Jewry during World War II. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1986.\n\nWiesel’s early life, spent in a small Hasidic community in the town of Sighet, was a rather hermetic existence of prayer and contemplation. In 1940 Sighet was annexed by Hungary, and, though the Hungarians were allied with Nazi Germany, it was not until the Germans invaded in March 1944 that the town was brought into the Holocaust. Within days, Jews were “defined” and their property confiscated. By April they were ghettoized, and on May 15 the deportations to Auschwitz began. Wiesel, his parents, and three sisters were deported to Auschwitz, where his mother and a sister were killed. He and his father were sent to Buna-Monowitz, the slave labour component of the Auschwitz camp. In January 1945 they were part of a death march to Buchenwald, where his father died on January 28 and from which Wiesel was liberated in April.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Nobel Prize for Literature (Mostly) Quiz\n\nAfter the war Wiesel settled in France, studied at the Sorbonne (1948–51), and wrote for French and Israeli newspapers. Wiesel went to the United States in 1956 and was naturalized in 1963. He was a professor at City College of New York (1972–76), and from 1976 he taught at Boston University, where he became Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities.\n\nDuring his time as a journalist in France, Wiesel was urged by the novelist François Mauriac to bear witness to what he had experienced in the concentration camps. The outcome was Wiesel’s first book, in Yiddish, Un di velt hot geshvign (1956; “And the World Has Remained Silent”), abridged as La Nuit (1958; Night), a memoir of a young boy’s spiritual reaction to Auschwitz. It is considered by some critics to be the most powerful literary expression of the Holocaust. His other works include La Ville de la chance (1962; “Town of Luck”; Eng. trans. The Town Beyond the Wall), a novel examining human apathy; Le Mendiant de Jérusalem (1968; A Beggar in Jerusalem), which raises the philosophical question of why people kill; Célébration hassidique (1972; “Hasidic Celebration”; Eng. trans. Souls on Fire), a critically acclaimed collection of Hasidic tales; Célébration biblique (1976; “Biblical Celebration”; Eng. trans. Messengers of God: Biblical Portraits and Legends); Le Testament d’un poète juif assassiné (1980; “The Testament of a Murdered Jewish Poet”; Eng. trans. The Testament); Le Cinquième Fils (1983; The Fifth Son); Le Crépuscule, au loin (1987; “Distant Twilight”; Eng. trans. Twilight); Le Mal et l’exil (1988; Evil and Exile [1990]); L’Oublié (1989; The Forgotten); and Tous les fleuves vont à la mer (1995; All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs)."
