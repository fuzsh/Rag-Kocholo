        "text": "A friend asked me the other day to choose my favorite Muhammad Ali fight. \"The Rumble in the Jungle,\" I responded. I was thinking of all the rhymes that accompanied it, from \"You think the world was shocked when Nixon resigned? Wait till I whip George Foreman's behind,\" to the very phrase \"rope-a-dope,\" as he named the strategy he used to defeat a superior opponent in the heat of Kinshasa. It was an athletic event but it was also a linguistic one.\n\nAlmost from the beginning of his career, when he was still called Cassius Clay, his rhymed couplets, like his punches, were brutal and blunt. And his poems, like his opponents, suffered a beating. The press’s earliest nicknames for him, such as “Cash the Brash” and “the Louisville Lip,” derived from his deriding of opponents with poetic insults. When in the history of boxing have critics been so irked by a fighter’s use of language? A.J. Liebling called him “Mr. Swellhead Bigmouth Poet,” while John Ahern, writing in The Boston Globe in 1964, mocked his “vaudeville” verse as “homespun doggerel.” Time magazine, in a particularly nasty triple dig in 1967 over Ali’s opposition to the Vietnam War, his embrace of the Nation of Islam and his name change, called him “Gaseous Cassius.”\n\nBut the same verse can strike one critic as doggerel and another as art, and not everyone missed the power — and the point — of Ali’s poetics. Even Ahern admitted that “the guy is a master at rhyming,” and The New Yorker editor and Ali biographer David Remnick would eulogize him as “a master of rhyming prediction and derision.” Perhaps Maya Angelou, whose own poetry is sometimes labeled doggerel, said it best: “It wasn’t only what he said and it wasn’t only how he said it; it was both of those things, and maybe there was a third thing in it, the spirit of Muhammad Ali, saying his poesies — ‘Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.’ I mean, as a poet, I like that! If he hadn’t put his name on it, I might have chosen to use that!”\n\nEdmund Wilson once said that “we have produced some of our truest poetry in the folk songs that are inseparable from their tunes.” Likewise, the power of Ali’s poetry, often bland on the page, is inseparable from the compelling resonance of his voice.\n\nA century ago, the great literary historian George Saintsbury, in his monumental “A History of English Prosody,” defined doggerel “in the worst sense” as “merely bad verse — verse which attempts a certain form or norm, and fails.” But Saintsbury maintains that there is another sort of doggerel that “ought never to die.”\n\n“This doggerel,” he wrote, “is excused by the felicitous result. The poet is not trying to do what he cannot do; he is trying to do something exceptional, outrageous, shocking — and does it to admiration.”\n\nIf ever there is to be a collection of Ali’s verse, Saintsbury’s observation is the perfect blurb for the dust jacket.\n\nSo many of the deeply moving tributes pouring out in memory of Ali have stressed his centrality in mainstreaming black radicalism, in broadening the appeal and reach of black cultural nationalism. (He also mainstreamed the complexity of being a black human being by trumpeting both his ego and id.) And there is no gainsaying the importance of Ali to our people’s embrace of the word “black” as a replacement of Negro, along with the right to change one’s religion and one’s name: “I am America,” he once said. “I am the part you won’t recognize. But get used to me. Black, confident, cocky, my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own; get used to me.”\n\nThe question is: How did Ali help to accomplish this transformation, help to mainstream black radicalism?\n\nThe first way was by challenging the Negro establishment with his change of religion, his change of name and then his stance against the war. Two of our greatest athletes, Floyd Patterson and Jackie Robinson, denounced Ali; Patterson for changing his name and religion; Robinson for his anti-war stand. But Ali also helped move black radicalism into the mainstream through his voice, his canny use of rhyme. Black poets had been using rhyme effectively for decades, both formal poets such as Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen, but also, on the streets, anonymous “barbershop poets” engaging in colorful linguistic rituals of insult such as “playing the dozens,” “woofing,” “capping,” all subsets of the language game of “signifying.” But Ali used rhyme in powerful new ways.\n\nHe was, if anything, a master signifier, the Shakespeare of linguistic pugilism, using his words to counterpunch his opponents, well before they stepped in the ring:\n\nNow Liston disappears from view, The crowd is getting frantic. But our radar stations have picked him up, He’s somewhere over the Atlantic.\n\nIt would be a mistake to say that Ali made black oral poetry more sophisticated or complex, but he did make it more political. After learning his local draft board had declared him eligible for induction into the Army in 1966, Ali recited this poem:\n\nKeep asking me, no matter how long, On the war in Vietnam, I sing this song: I ain’t got no quarrel with no Viet Cong.\n\nWhen Ali described himself as “the astronaut of boxing,” that Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey “were just jet pilots — I’m in a world of my own,” he was right at least about the last part: The politics of his change of name, the politics of his religious conversion and the politics of his opposition to the Vietnam War gave his poetry a political context that Ali couldn’t have escaped if he had wanted to.\n\nIn 1964, Cassius Clay upset Sonny Liston to become the world heavyweight champion, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Who could have imagined that three years later, King would denounce the Vietnam War just a few weeks before Ali would refuse induction. King, the resonant voice of the civil rights movement, turned to Ali, the renegade lyrical poet from the ring, to justify his position: “Like Muhammad Ali puts it, we are all — black and brown and poor — victims of the same system of oppression.” A saint quoting the words of our most radical versifier.\n\nI’m not arguing that Ali should be added to the next edition of “The Norton Anthology of Poetry.” But I am arguing his importance to the shaping of the black poetic tradition. There was certainly a direct connection between the politics of Ali’s rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry of both the Last Poets group, formed on Malcolm X Day in Harlem in 1968, and Gil Scott-Heron, who recorded his first album in 1970, a hip and a hop between them and the birth of rap music just a few years later.\n\nAs George Saintsbury argued back in 1906, there was a kind a doggerel that could achieve for its creator a form of immortality. “Like the other kind, it has never died,” he wrote. “And unlike the other kind, it ought never to die.”\n\nPerhaps these words anticipate the literary legacy of Muhammad Ali.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. is a professor of literature at Harvard University and executive producer of the forthcoming PBS documentary \"And Still I Rise: Black America Since MLK.\" This article was first published in the New York Times."
