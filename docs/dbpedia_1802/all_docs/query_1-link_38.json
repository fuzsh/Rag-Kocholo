        "text": "Multicenter Evaluation of Octreotide as Secondary Prophylaxis in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Devices and Gastrointestinal Bleeding.\n\nPubMed\n\nShah, Keyur B; Gunda, Sampath; Emani, Sitaramesh; Kanwar, Manreet K; Uriel, Nir; Colombo, Paolo C; Uber, Patricia A; Sears, Melissa L; Chuang, Joyce; Farrar, David J; Brophy, Donald F; Smallfield, George B\n\n2017-11-01\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is one of the most common complications after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation. More than one third of patients with incident bleed go on to develop recurrent GI bleeding. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is proposed to reduce the risk of recurrent GI bleeding in this population. This multicenter, retrospective analysis evaluated 51 continuous-flow left ventricular assist device patients who received secondary prophylaxis with octreotide after their index GI bleed from 2009 to 2015. All patients had a hospitalization for GI bleed and received octreotide after discharge. Patient demographics, medical and medication history, and clinical characteristics of patients who rebled after receiving octreotide were compared with non-rebleeders. These data were also compared with matched historical control patients previously enrolled in the HMII (HeartMate II) clinical trials, none of whom received octreotide, to provide a context for the bleeding rates. Twelve patients (24%) who received secondary octreotide prophylaxis developed another GI bleed, whereas 39 (76%) did not. There were similar intergroup demographics; however, significantly more bleeders had a previous GI bleeding history before left ventricular assist device placement (33% versus 5%; P =0.02) and greater frequency of angiodysplasia confirmed during endoscopy (58% versus 23%; P =0.03). Fewer patients in this study experienced a recurrent GI bleed compared with a matched historical control group that did not receive octreotide (24% versus 43%; P =0.04). Patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist device receiving secondary prophylaxis with octreotide had a significantly lower GI bleed recurrence compared with historical controls not treated with octreotide. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these data.

Perioperative administration of octreotide may control hyperthyroidism, as well as shrink tumor size. The effects of preoperative octreotide treatment were assessed in a large number of patients with TSHomas. Of 81 patients who underwent surgery for TSHoma at Toranomon Hospital between January 2001 and May 2013, 44 received preoperative short-term octreotide. After excluding one patient because of side effects, 19 received octreotide as a subcutaneous injection, and 24 as a long-acting release (LAR) injection. Median duration between initiation of octreotide treatment and surgery was 33.5 days. Octreotide normalized free T4 in 36 of 43 patients (84%) and shrank tumors in 23 of 38 (61%). Length of octreotide treatment did not differ significantly in patients with and without hormonal normalization (p=0.09) and with and without tumor shrinkage (p=0.84). Serum TSH and free T4 concentrations, duration of treatment, incidence of growth hormone (GH) co-secretion, results of octreotide loading tests, form of administration (subcutaneous injection or LAR), tumor volume, and tumor consistency did not differ significantly in patients with and without hormonal normalization and with and without tumor shrinkage. Short-term preoperative octreotide administration was highly effective for TSHoma shrinkage and normalization of excess hormone concentrations, with tolerable side effects.\n\nAcute Variceal Bleeding: Does Octreotide Improve Outcomes in Patients with Different Functional Hepatic Reserve?\n\nPubMed\n\nMonreal-Robles, Roberto; Cortez-HernÃ¡ndez, Carlos A; GonzÃ¡lez-GonzÃ¡lez, JosÃ© A; Abraldes, Juan G; Bosques-Padilla, Francisco J; Silva-Ramos, HÃ©ctor N; GarcÃ­a-Flores, Jorge A; Maldonado-Garza, HÃ©ctor J\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCurrent guidelines do not differentiate in the utilization of vasoactive drugs in patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding (AVB) depending on liver disease severity. In this retrospective study, clinical outcomes in 100 patients receiving octreotide plus endoscopic therapy (ET) and 216 patients with ET alone were compared in terms of failure to control bleeding, in-hospital mortality, and transfusion requirements stratifying the results according to liver disease severity by Child-Pugh (CP) score and MELD. In patients with CP-A or those with MELD < 10 octreotide was not associated with a better outcome compared to ET alone in terms of hospital mortality (CP-A: 0.0 vs. 0.0%; MELD < 10: 0.0 vs. 2.9%, p = 1.00), failure to control bleeding (CP-A: 8.7 vs. 3.7%, p = 0.58; MELD < 10: 5.3 vs. 4.3%, p = 1.00) and need for transfusion (CP-A: 39.1 vs. 61.1%, p = 0.09; MELD < 10: 63.2 vs. 62.9%, p = 1.00). Those with severe liver dysfunction in the octreotide group showed better outcomes compared to the non-octreotide group in terms of hospital mortality (CP-B/C: 3.9 vs. 13.0%, p = 0.04; MELD â¥ 10: 3.9 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.03) and need for transfusion (CP-B/C: 58.4 vs. 71.6%, p = 0.05; MELD â¥ 10: 50.6 vs. 72.7%, p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, octreotide was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.028) and need for transfusion (p = 0.008) only in patients with severe liver dysfunction (CP-B/C or MELD â¥ 10). Patients with cirrhosis and AVB categorized as CP-A or MELD < 10 had similar clinical outcomes during hospitalization whether or not they received octreotide.\n\nSevere hyperkalaemia resulting from octreotide use in a haemodialysis patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdabala, Madhuri; Jhaveri, Kenar D; Gitman, Michael\n\n2010-10-01\n\nA 48-year-old man, with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis, presented to the emergency department with sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia. His hypoglycaemia was persistent despite glucose infusion, so he was treated with octreotide. Octreotide administration reversed the hypoglycaemia but also resulted in severe hyperkalaemia. The patient was urgently dialysed, the octreotide was discontinued and his potassium normalized. We believe that the hyperkalaemia was caused by octreotide-induced insulin suppression and resultant impaired cellular potassium uptake. Although octreotide may be an effective therapy in refractory sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia, it should be used with caution in patients on dialysis.\n\nProphylactic use of octreotide for asparaginase-induced acute pancreatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakaguchi, Sachi; Higa, Takeshi; Suzuki, Mitsuyoshi; Fujimura, Junya; Shimizu, Toshiaki\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn the present study, we sought to evaluate the prophylactic use of octreotide for asparaginase-induced acute pancreatitis. We reviewed the medical records of seven patients in two institutions who received prophylactic octreotide for re-administration of asparaginase after asparaginase-induced acute pancreatitis. Three patients completed asparaginase treatment without developing pancreatitis, and four experienced recurrence of pancreatitis. A literature search using PubMed identified four additional patients in whom asparaginase was successfully re-administered with octreotide. Prophylactic use of octreotide may, thus, be warranted for patients who would benefit from re-administration of asparaginase for cancer treatment; however, careful observation is needed to monitor for breakthrough recurrence of pancreatitis.\n\nOctreotide-Associated Neutropenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nTse, Stacy S; Kish, Troy\n\n2017-06-01\n\nDrug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis are rare adverse events but can be fatal. Neutropenia can be induced by a myriad of drugs from almost every pharmacologic class. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that has been used to treat variceal bleeding, acromegaly, and severe diarrhea associated with metastatic tumors, and to reduce symptoms in the setting of malignant bowel obstruction and pseudoobstruction. The most common adverse effects associated with octreotide include pain at the injection site and gastrointestinal effects such as loose stools, cramping, and nausea; neutropenia is not currently listed as an adverse effect of the drug. We describe the case of an 87-year-old man who developed neutropenia immediately after administration of three doses of subcutaneous octreotide. He presented to the hospital with a history of constipation and straining for 3Â days. He was admitted, and laxatives, suppositories, and enemas were administered over the next 3Â days to induce a bowel movement; however, they were ineffective. Bowel obstruction secondary to a mass was confirmed by computed tomography; the mass was eventually diagnosed as colon cancer. Octreotide 100Â Âµg subcutaneously every 8Â hours was started for the obstruction on the evening of hospital day 4. After the patient had received 3 doses of octreotide, his white blood cell count (WBC) had decreased from 4.1Â ÃÂ 10 3 /mm 3 (neutrophils 75.4%, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 3.1Â ÃÂ 10 3 /mm 3 ) on admission to 1.6Â ÃÂ 10 3 /mm 3 (neutrophils 62%, ANC 0.99Â ÃÂ 10 3 /mm 3 ) on day 5. Given the temporal relationship of octreotide and neutropenia as well as the lack of a reasonable alternative cause, it was suspected that octreotide was the most likely culprit of the patient's neutropenia. Octreotide was subsequently discontinued, and his WBC increased to 4.9Â ÃÂ 10 3 /mm 3 (neutrophils 66.3%, ANC 3.2Â ÃÂ 10 3 /mm 3 ) the next day. The remainder of the patient's hospitalization was not significant\n\nPrimary intestinal lymphangiectasia in children: is octreotide an effective and safe option in the treatment?\n\nPubMed\n\nSari, Sinan; Baris, Zeren; Dalgic, Buket\n\n2010-10-01\n\nOctreotide has been suggested as a medical treatment option in refractory cases of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (IL). There are few data about the long-term effect and safety of octreotide for IL in the literature. In the present article we analyzed pediatric cases of primary IL with long-term octreotide treatment and discussed its safety profile. Between 1999 and 2008, 13 children were diagnosed in our clinic as having IL. Six patients with primary IL were followed up, receiving octreotide therapy. The clinical data of the patients and duration of therapy, dose, and side effects of octreotide were evaluated. Octreotide, 15 to 20 Î¼g per body weight 2 times daily subcutaneously, was given to all of the patients. Duration of the octreotide treatment changed between 3 and 37 months. Stool frequency decreased in all of the patients after starting octreotide treatment. Serum albumin could be maintained at normal levels in 3 patients. The requirement of albumin infusions decreased in all of the patients. Acute pancreatitis was observed as a side effect of octreotide in 1 patient. Octreotide may help to maintain serum albumin levels, improve clinical findings, and decrease the requirement of albumin infusions in refractory cases of primary IL.\n\nEffects of Insulin and Octreotide on Memory and Growth Hormone in Alzheimer's Disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWatson, G. Stennis; Baker, Laura D.; Cholerton, Brenna A.; Rhoads, Kristoffer W.; Merriam, George R.; Schellenberg, Gerard D.; Asthana, PhD;Sanjay; Cherrier, Monique; Craft, Suzanne\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBoth insulin alone and the somatostatin analogue octreotide alone facilitate memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since octreotide inhibits endogenous insulin secretion, the cognitive effects of insulin and octreotide may not be independent. This study tested the individual and interactive effects of insulin and octreotide on memory and plasma growth hormone (GH) levels in older adults. Participants were 16 memory-impaired (AD=7, amnestic mild cognitive impairment=9; apolipoprotein E [APOE] Îµ4- [no Îµ4 alleles]=9, Îµ4+ [1-2 Îµ4 alleles]=7) and 19 cognitively-intact older adults (APOE Îµ4-=17, Îµ4+=1). On separate days, fasting participants received counterbalanced infusions of (1) insulin (1 mUÂ·kg-1Â·min-1) and dextrose to maintain euglycemia, (2) octreotide (150 Î¼g/h), (3) insulin, dextrose, and octreotide, or (4) saline. Story recall was the principal endpoint. Insulin alone facilitated delayed recall for Îµ4-patients, relative to Îµ4+ patients (P=0.0012). Furthermore, Îµ4- patients with higher Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) scores had greater octreotide-induced memory facilitation (P=0.0298). For healthy adults, octreotide facilitated memory (P=0.0122). Unexpectedly, hyperinsulinemia with euglycemia increased GH levels in healthy controls (P=0.0299). Thus, insulin and octreotide appear to regulate memory in older adults. APOE Îµ4 genotype modulates responses to insulin and octreotide. Finally, insulin may regulate GH levels during euglycemia.

Octreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, which seems to be promising in clinical use. a. to evaluate the efficacy of octreotide in pain control of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, as well as octreotide's outcome in the hepatic function; b. to investigate the relationship between pain intensity and beta-endorphin blood levels in the patients. The study group consisted of 25 patients (age range: 48-89 years, 14 males, 11 females) with far advanced gastrointestinal cancer. All the patients were under s.c. morphine administration using a continuous infusion pump. When pain intensity increased, 0.6 mg/day of octreotide was added to the therapeutic regimen in the same syringe of the continuous infusion pump. Pain intensity and beta-endorphin blood levels were measured five times: Once before octreotide administration and the other four 12, 24, 48 hours and 7 days after. A complete blood count and a biochemical screening profile were taken before the administration of octreotide as well as on the 7th and the 14th day. 24 out of 25 cases showed a reduction in pain intensity (pretreatment x = 5.3, post-treatment x = 0.6). beta-endorphin blood levels increased significantly during the study (an increase of 184.78% was observed on the 7th treatment day). In one patient pain control was achieved by increasing morphine dosage. Statistically significant changes were observed in hepatic function indices (p < 0.02). Significant side-effects were not observed. Octreotide can be used as an adjuvant analgesic in the management of gastrointestinal cancer pain which is managed by continuous s.c. administration. Although fuither research needs to be done, octreotide's administration seemed to improve hepatic function of these patients, therefore, it could potentially have a positive effect in the patient's quality of life.\n\nSuccessful Treatment of Protein-Losing Enteropathy Induced by Intestinal Lymphangiectasia in a Liver Cirrhosis Patient with Octreotide: A Case Report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Hang Lak; Kim, Jin Bae; Jeon, Yong Chul; Sohn, Joo Hyun; Hahm, Joon Soo\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA 47-yr-old man with hepatitis B virus associated liver cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital with diarrhea and generalized edema and diagnosed as protein-losing enteropathy due to intestinal lymphangiectasia by intestinal biopsy and 99mTc albumin scan. During hospitalization, he received subcutaneous octreotide therapy. After 2 weeks of octreotide therapy, follow-up albumin scan showed no albumin leakage, and the serum albumin level was sustained. We speculate that liver cirrhosis can be a cause of intestinal lymphangiectasia and administration of octreotide should be considered for patients with intestinal lymphangiectasia whose clinical and biochemical abnormalities do not respond to a low-fat diet.

Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is one mechanism leading to PLE. Few syndromes are associated with PIL; Hennekam syndrome (HS) is one of them. The principal treatment for PIL is a high protein, low fat diet with medium chain triglycerides supplementation. Supportive therapy includes albumin infusion. Few publications have supported the use of octreotide to diminish protein loss and minimize hypoalbuminemia seen in PIL. There are no publications on the treatment of PIL with octreotide in patients with HS. We report two children with HS and PLE in which we used octreotide to decrease intestinal protein loss. In one patient, octreotide increased serum albumin to an acceptable level without further need for albumin infusions. The other patient responded more dramatically with near normal serum albumin levels and cessation of albumin infusions. In achieving a good response to octreotide in both patients, we add to the publications supporting the use of octreotide in PIL and suggest that octreotide should be tried in patients with PIL secondary to HS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the use of octreotide in HS-associated PIL.\n\nOctreotide in Hennekam syndrome-associated intestinal lymphangiectasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAl Sinani, Siham; Rawahi, Yusria Al; Abdoon, Hamed\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA number of disorders have been described to cause protein losing enteropathy (PLE) in children.

PMID:23180957\n\nA prospective, multicentre study to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of octreotide LARÂ® (long-acting repeatable octreotide) in the primary therapy of patients with acromegaly\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMercado, Moises; Borges, Fatima; Bouterfa, Hakim; Chang, Tien-Chun; Chervin, Alberto; Farrall, Andrew J; Patocs, Attila; Petersenn, Stephan; Podoba, Jan; Safari, Mitra; Wardlaw, Joanna\n\n2007-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of octreotide LARÂ® (long-acting repeatable octreotide) in the primary therapy of acromegaly. Design and patients Ninety-eight previously untreated acromegalics were recruited into this prospective multicentre study. A total of 68 patients successfully completed 48 weeks of the study period, received 12 doses of octreotide LAR 10â30 mg every 4 weeks, and constituted the population used for this analysis. Measurements and results A clinically relevant reduction (i.e. to â¤ 5 Âµg/l) in mean GH (mGH) was recorded in 72% of patients after 24 weeks of treatment, and 42% reached a âsafeâ GH value (â¤ 2Â·5 Âµg/l). At week 48, 16 more patients were considered partial GH responders (GH > 2Â·5 Âµg/l and â¤ 5 Âµg/l) and 44% had reached a GH level â¤ 2Â·5 Âµg/l. IGF-1 levels normalized in 38% and 34% of patients after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, respectively. At study completion, 10 patients (14Â·7%) who had not normalized their IGF-1 levels had achieved at least a 50% decrement in this marker. In eight microadenoma patients, tumour volume decreased from a mean baseline level of 298 Â± 145 mm3 to 139 Â± 94 mm3 after 24 weeks and to 99 Â± 70 mm3 after 48 weeks of therapy. In 60 patients with macroadenoma, the corresponding values were 3885 Â± 5077 mm3 at baseline and 2723 Â± 3435 and 2406 Â± 3207 mm3 after 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. At weeks 24 and 48, a significant (> 20%) tumour volume reduction was reported in 63% and 75% of patients, respectively. A reduction in the severity of symptoms of acromegaly was observed early in treatment and was maintained throughout the study period. Conclusion Octreotide LAR represents a viable alternative to surgery for primary treatment of acromegaly leading to a progressive regression of tumour volume, a sustained control of biochemical abnormalities and an adequate relief of symptoms of the disease. PMID:17465997\n\nA randomised, double blind, multicentre trial of octreotide in moderate to severe acute pancreatitis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUhl, W; Buchler, M; Malfertheiner, P; Beger, H; Adler, G; Gaus, W; the, G\n\n1999-01-01\n\nBACKGROUNDâThe pharmacological inhibition of exocrine pancreatic secretion with the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been advocated as a specific treatment of acute pancreatitis.â¨AIMâTo investigate the efficacy of octreotide in acute pancreatitis in a randomised, placebo controlled trial.â¨METHODSâ302 patients from 32Â hospitals, fulfilling the criteria for moderate to severe acute pancreatitis within 96Â hours of the onset of symptoms, were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: group P (n=103) received placebo, while groups O1 (n=98) and O2 (n=101) received 100Â and 200Â Âµg of octreotide, respectively, by subcutaneous injection three times daily for seven days. The primary outcome variable was a score composed of mortality and 15Â typical complications of acute pancreatitis.â¨RESULTSâThe three groups were well matched with respect to pretreatment characteristics. An intent to treat analysis of all 302Â patients revealed no significant differences among treatment groups with respect to mortality (P: 16%; O1: 15%; O2: 12%), the rate of newly developed complications, the duration of pain, surgical interventions, or the length of the hospital stay. A valid for efficacy analysis (251Â patients) also revealed no significant differences.â¨CONCLUSIONSâThis trial shows no benefit of octreotide in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.â¨â¨â¨Keywords: acute pancreatitis; somatostatin; octreotide; randomised controlled multicentre trial PMID:10369711\n\nEverolimus in Combination with Octreotide Long-Acting Repeatable in a First-Line Setting for Patients with Neuroendocrine Tumors: A 5-Year Update.\n\nPubMed\n\nBajetta, Emilio; Catena, Laura; Pusceddu, Sara; Spada, Francesca; Iannacone, Claudio; Sarno, Italo; Di Menna, Giandomenico; Dottorini, Lorenzo; Marte, Anna Maria\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe previously presented data of this multicentric, phase II study showing that everolimus plus octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) for advanced neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), in the first line setting, is an active and safe treatment. We now present updated data at 5 years. Patients with advanced well-differentiated, previously untreated neuroendocrine tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic tract and of the lung received octreotide LAR 30 mg plus everolimus 10 mg/day. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). We performed an analysis of \"long responder\" patients and of time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years. Fifty patients were enrolled; the primary tumor site was: pancreas (14 patients), lung (11 patients), ileum (9 patients), jejunum/duodenum (2 patients), and unknown (14 patients). Seventeen (34%) of these patients have received treatment for more than 2 years. The median exposure to study drugs was 519.5 days (range 48-2,024). Currently 3 patients are still in treatment. The ORR (partial response + complete response) was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.4-28.6): complete response 1 patient (2%), partial response 8 patients (16%), stable disease 37 patients (74%). The median TTP was 33.6 months (95% CI 18.7-41.2) and the median OS was 61.0 months (95% CI 49.8-not reached). In this update of clinical outcome at 5-year follow-up, everolimus plus octreotide has been shown to be active in advanced NENs. The current analysis showed a further prolongation of TTP and a long exposure to the study drug without major side effects in the long term. Â© 2017 S.

Medical records of 39 patients with postoperative enterocutaneous fistulas treated in our Department between January 1988 and August 2000 were reviewed. Sixteen patients had duodenal fistulas and 23 had jejunal or ileal fistulas. According to the daily output, there were 20 low fistula output and 19 high fistula output. Conservative treatment consisted of nutritional support with total parenteral nutrition in all the patients. Administration of Octreotide (100 micrograms every 8 hours, subcutaneously) was done in 21 consecutive patients until spontaneous closure of the fistulas or their subsequent surgical closure. The occurrence of fistulas closure was compared using the Fisher's exact test. A mean reduction of 50% of fistula output was noted in all the patients who received Octreotide, within 24 hours of its administration. Spontaneous closure was achieved in 13 patients of the Octreotide group (mean closure time: 15.3 days, range: 6-35) and in 12 patients treated only with total parenteral nutrition (mean closure time: 13.9 days, range: 7-25); this difference was not significant (P = 0.5). Also, the fistula closure rate was not influenced by the anatomic site, the high or low output, and the age of the patient. The results of this study suggest that, as an adjunct treatment to total parenteral nutrition, Octreotide reduces rapidly the fistula output without significant influence in the spontaneous closure rate.\n\nAdditive effect of ketoconazole and octreotide in the treatment of severe adrenocorticotropin-dependent hypercortisolism.\n\nPubMed\n\nVignati, F; Loli, P\n\n1996-08-01\n\nOver the last few years ketoconazole and octreotide have been employed in the treatment of pituitary-dependent or ectopic Cushing's syndrome. In four patients (two men and two women, aged 25-64 yr) with severe ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism in whom medical treatment with ketoconazole showed limited effectiveness and/or tolerability, we tried the association with octreotide. In all patients ketoconazole (200-1000 mg) induced a marked decrease in urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion, but normalization could not be achieved. After ketoconazole discontinuation, three patients received octreotide alone (300-1500 micrograms/day, sc). This drug caused a dramatic decrease in UFC excretion, although not normalization; in all patients, escape from treatment occurred. Combined treatment was carried out for 10-180 days. Urinary cortisol excretion normalized and remained steadily within normal limits in three of four patients in whom normal UFC excretion had never been attained with both single drug regimens; in the fourth patient, UFC excretion decreased to levels lower than those achieved with ketoconazole or octreotide alone. The association with octreotide allowed a reduction in the daily dose of ketoconazole in three patients. Consistent with the steady reduction of cortisol production, a striking clinical improvement occurred in all patients after starting combined treatment. The normalization of UFC in three of four patients treated with both agents suggests that this approach may be useful in the long term treatment of severe forms of hypercortisolism of both pituitary and ectopic origin. In contrast to the limited effectiveness of each drug taken singularly at the same or higher doses, the association of the two drugs had an additive effect in the attainment of normal urinary cortisol excretion.\n\nSwitching patients with acromegaly from octreotide to pasireotide improves biochemical control: crossover extension to a randomized, double-blind, Phase III study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBronstein, Marcello D; Fleseriu, Maria; Neggers, Sebastian; Colao, Annamaria; Sheppard, Michael; Gu, Feng; Shen, Chiung-Chyi; Gadelha, MÃ´nica; Farrall, Andrew J; Hermosillo ResÃ©ndiz, Karina; Ruffin, Matthieu; Chen, YinMiao; Freda, Pamela\n\n2016-04-02\n\nMany patients with acromegaly do not achieve biochemical control with first-generation somatostatin analogues. A large, multicenter, randomized, Phase III core study demonstrated that pasireotide LAR had significantly superior efficacy over octreotide LAR. This analysis explores the efficacy and safety of switching therapeutic arms in inadequately controlled patients during a 12-month crossover extension. Patients with inadequate biochemical control (GH â¥2.5Â Î¼g/L and/or IGF-1â>âULN) at end of core study (month 12) were eligible to switch to pasireotide LAR 40Â mg/28Â days (nâ=â81) or octreotide LAR 20Â mg/28Â days (nâ=â38). One dose escalation to pasireotide LAR 60Â mg/28Â days or octreotide LAR 30Â mg/28Â days was permitted, but not mandatory, at month 17 or 20. Twelve months after crossover, 17.3Â % of pasireotide LAR and 0Â % of octreotide LAR patients achieved GH <2.5Â Î¼g/L and normal IGF-1 (main outcome measure); 27.2 and 5.3Â % of pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR patients achieved normal IGF-1, respectively; 44.4 and 23.7Â % of pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR patients achieved GH <2.5Â Î¼g/L, respectively. Mean (Â±SD) tumor volume further decreased from the end of the core study by 25Â % (Â±25) and 18Â % (Â±28); 54.3Â % of pasireotide LAR and 42.3Â % of octreotide LAR patients achieved significant (â¥20Â %) tumor volume reduction during the extension. The safety profile of pasireotide LAR was similar to that of octreotide LAR, with the exception of the frequency and degree of hyperglycemia-related adverse events. Pasireotide LAR is a promising treatment option for patients with acromegaly inadequately controlled with the first-generation somatostatin analogue octreotide LAR. clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00600886 .

The most important factor for long-term survival of thymoma patients is complete resection (R0) of the tumor. We therefore evaluated the response to and the induction of resectability of primarily or locally recurrent unresectable thymomas and thymic carcinomas by octreotide Long-Acting Release (LAR) plus prednisone therapy in patients with positive octreotide scans. In this open label, single-arm phase II study, 17 patients with thymomas considered unresectable or locally recurrent thymoma (n = 15) and thymic carcinoma (n = 2) at Masaoka stage III were enrolled. Octreotide LAR (30 mg once every 2 weeks) was administered in combination with prednisone (0.6 mg/kg per day) for a maximum of 24 weeks (study design according to FlemingÂ´s one sample multiple testing procedure for phase II clinical trials). Tumor size was evaluated by volumetric CT measurements, and a decrease in tumor volume of at least 20% at week 12 compared to baseline was considered as a response. We found that octreotide LAR plus prednisone elicited response in 15 of 17 patients (88%). Median reduction of tumor volume after 12 weeks of treatment was 51% (range 20%â86%). Subsequently, complete surgical resection was achieved in five (29%) and four patients (23%) after 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Octreotide LAR plus prednisone treatment was discontinued in two patients before week 12 due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects or adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (71%), infectious (65%), and hematological (41%) complications. In conclusion, octreotide LAR plus prednisone is efficacious in patients with primary or recurrent unresectable thymoma with respect to tumor regression. Octreotide LAR plus prednisone was well tolerated and adverse events were in line with the known safety profile of both agents.

For the in vivo study, 100 micrograms of octreotide sc was given 30 and 180 min after cannulation of the cubital vein and 100 micrograms of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) was injected iv at 210 min. Serum ACTH and cortisol levels were measured for 390 min. In vivo, octreotide had no significant effect either on basal or CRH-stimulated ACTH levels and did not influence cortisol levels. The in vitro studies were conducted with corticotropic adenoma cell cultures derived from adenoma tissue obtained from six patients with Cushing's disease. In four of six cell cultures, octreotide (1 nmol/l-1 mumol/l) inhibited basal ACTH secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition ranged from 70 to 92% for 1 nmol/l octreotide to 14-46% for 1 mumol/l octreotide as compared to controls (100%). In three of three octreotide-responsive adenoma cell cultures investigated. CRH-stimulated ACTH secretion was suppressed by octreotide. Hydrocortisone pretreatment in vitro abolished the inhibitory effect of octreotide on ACTH secretion in one octreotide-responsive corticotropic adenoma cell culture. In conclusion, we showed that octreotide in most cases could inhibit the ACTH release from human corticotropic adenoma cells in vitro but had no suppressive effect on ACTH levels of patients with Cushing's disease in vivo. This discrepancy could be due to a somatostatin receptor down-regulation by cortisol at the hypercortisolemic state in vivo.\n\nEffect of everolimus on the pharmacokinetics of octreotide long-acting repeatable in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors: An analysis of the randomized phase III RADIANT-2 trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nPavel, M E; Becerra, C; Grosch, K; Cheung, W; Hasskarl, J; Yao, J C\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIn the RADIANT-2 trial, addition of everolimus to octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) exhibited a clinically meaningful 5.1-month improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced functional neuroendocrine tumors. In this study, we characterized the effects of everolimus co-administration on octreotide LAR pharmacokinetics and its relationship with efficacy and safety. At least one evaluable blood everolimus and plasma octreotide predose minimum concentration (C min ) was available for 182 patients and 294 patients, respectively. Concomitant everolimus administration increased octreotide C min with a geometric mean ratio (everolimus/placebo) of 1.47 (90% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-1.64). Risk for progression was consistently reduced when everolimus C min was increased twofold, regardless of octreotide exposure (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.46-1.18; HR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.32-0.92 for 6 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL octreotide, respectively). Risk for pulmonary or metabolic events was associated with increased everolimus C min . Co-administration of everolimus plus octreotide LAR increased octreotide C min , which did not impact efficacy.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of octreotide-LAR, a long-acting somatostatin analog, in anovulatory abdominal obese women with PCOS. A single-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed, lasting for 7 months. The patients were ambulatory throughout the study. Twenty PCOS subjects were enrolled. Eighteen completed the study. A low-calorie diet was given during the first month, a low-calorie diet plus octreotide-LAR (10 mg; n = 10 subjects) or placebo (n = 10 subjects) was then given, with one im injection every 28 d (for 6 months). The main outcome measures were clinical features, computerized tomography measurement of fat distribution, androgens, GH, IGF-I, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin, and ovulation. Octreotide had no additional effect in reducing body fat or improving fat distribution than placebo. Conversely, octreotide produced an additional decrease in fasting (P = 0.018) and glucose-stimulated (P = 0.038) insulin levels, an increase in IGFBP-2 (P = 0.042) and IGFBP-3 (P = 0.047), and an improvement in hirsutism (P = 0.004). Moreover, a trend toward greater reductions in testosterone (P = 0.061) and androstenedione (P = 0.069) was observed in women treated with octreotide-LAR compared with those given placebo. All women treated with octreotide ovulated at the end of the study compared with only one of those receiving placebo (P < 0.001). Octreotide-LAR may be usefully applied to hypocalorically dieting, abdominal obese PCOS women to improve hyperandrogenism and the insulin-IGF-I system. Restoration of ovulatory menstrual cycles appears to be another advantage of this treatment.\n\n[A clinical study using octreotide in relieving gastrointestinal symptoms due to bowel obstruction in a terminally ill cancer patient].\n\nPubMed\n\nShima, Yasuo; Yamaguchi, Kensei; Miyata, Yoshinori; Hyodo, Ichinosuke; Yagi, Yasuo; Honke, Yoshifumi\n\n2004-09-01\n\nTerminally ill cancer patients with complicated bowel obstructions often have poor quality of life (QOL) due to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Many of these patients are inoperable because of poor general conditions, and half of these patients can't be managed by conventional antiemetics. There are many reports indicating octreotide is effective for these patients. In the present study, 13 patients (5 patients without a nasogastric tube and 8 patients with) were administered octreotide at 300 microg/day by 24 hours continuous subcutaneous infusion. Among the effectively evaluable 10 cases, 6 cases (60.0%) were assessed as effective according to the efficacy criteria based on the JCOG toxicity scale. In the 6 cases who had nasogastric tubes, the nasogastric aspirates decreased from 890 ml (550-1,950) to 480 ml (180-1,790). Vomiting was successfully controlled after the removals of nasogastric tubes in 4 out of 6 cases (66.7%), regarding safety, 2 out of 13 cases (15.4%) showed an excess of liver enzymes but no clinically suspected adverse effect was observed. Octreotide is effective and well tolerated in terminally ill cancer patients with malignant bowel obstruction.\n\nComparing the Cost of Treatment with Octreotide Long-Acting Release versus Lanreotide in Patients with Metastatic Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nAyyagari, Rajeev; Neary, Maureen; Li, Shang; Rokito, Ariel; Yang, Hongbo; Xie, Jipan; Benson, Al B\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe 2 somatostatin analogs currently recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) include octreotide long-acting release (Sandostatin LAR) for injectable suspension and lanreotide (Somatuline Depot) injection for subcutaneous use. To estimate the costs to payers associated with 30-mg octreotide LAR and 120-mg lanreotide treatment among patients with metastatic GI-NETs. The costs to payers associated with the 2 drugs were estimated by including the costs of each drug, drug administration, and adverse events. The unit drug costs for octreotide LAR and for lanreotide were obtained from ReadyPrice Wholesale Acquisition Cost; the doses were obtained from published studies. The adverse event rates were obtained from 2 phase 3 clinical trials, PROMID and CLARINET. Deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses were used to assess the impact of modifying assumptions and inputs on the results, including the 2017 Average Sales Price (ASP). All costs were estimated in 2016 US dollars, with a constant discount of 3%. The costs to payers associated with the treatment of GI-NETs during 1-, 3-, and 5-year horizons were $74,566, $180,082, and $262,344, respectively, for octreotide LAR and $84,856, $205,562, and $299,667, respectively, for lanreotide. Thus, octreotide LAR was associated with lower costs by $10,290 (1 year), $25,480 (3 years), and $37,323 (5 years) compared with lanreotide. Over a 5-year horizon, the costs of adverse events and administration accounted for 0.72% of the total cost for octreotide LAR and 0.51% of the total cost for lanreotide. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the main factor affecting the cost difference was the price of the drugs; analyses using the ASP yielded similar results. For the management of metastatic GI-NETs, the cost to payers of treatment with 30-mg octreotide LAR is considerably lower than with 120-mg lanreotide over 1-, 3-, and 5-year horizons.

This radioligand binds specifically to somatostatin receptors and is suitable for SPECT examinations. The aim of this study was to clarify whether an increased somatostatin receptor density can be imaged and quantified in patients with endocrine ophthalmopathy (e.o.). 7 patients between 34 and 55 years with e.o. at stages III to VI and 4 controls between 38 and 63 years were examined. All patients and controls received approximately 200 MBq [111In]-DTPA-D-phenylalanine-octreotide by IV injection. A SPECT examination was performed 4 hours after injection and a normalised tracer uptake (A(n)) was calculated for both orbitae. In patients with e.o. the values of A(n) were significantly higher compared with controls (P = 0.002). There was a correlation between A(n) and exophthalmus stages according to Hertel with r = 0.844 (P = 0.001). These results indicate that [111In]-DTPA-D-phenylalanine-octreotide SPECT might be useful for the in vivo assessment of an increased somatostatin receptor density in e.o. These findings could have an impact on the treatment with somatostatin analogous in e.o.\n\nEfficacy of octreotide in the management of chronic diarrhoea in AIDS.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomeu, J; MirÃ³, J M; Sirera, G; Mallolas, J; Arnal, J; Valls, M E; Tortosa, F; Clotet, B; Foz, M\n\n1991-12-01\n\nPatients with HIV infection were studied to assess the efficacy of octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, in the long-term management of refractory diarrhoea. Dosage of subcutaneous octreotide was increased progressively at 48 h intervals from 150 to 300, 750 and 1500 micrograms/day according to response. Twenty-nine patients, 21 with Cryptosporidium enteritis, one with Isospora belli enteritis and seven with no identifiable pathogen were selected for the study; four of these were excluded from the study because of death during the first month (two cases), abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis (one case each). Twenty-five patients were evaluable for response. Ten patients (four with Cryptosporidium enteritis, five without an identifiable pathogen and one with I. belli enteritis) achieved a complete response (40%) and nine cases (all with cryptosporidial enteritis) had a partial response (36%). Patients with higher weight and Karnofsky performance status and non-cryptosporidial enteritis had a better response to treatment. Mean durations of treatment and response were 4.2 +/- 4.2 and 4.4 +/- 4.5 months, respectively. In the absence of specific agents for cryptosporidial enteritis and HIV enteropathy, octreotide was found to be useful in the management of chronic diarrhoea in AIDS patients.\n\nTolerability of continuous subcutaneous octreotide used in combination with other drugs.\n\nPubMed\n\nMercadante, S\n\n1995-01-01\n\nContinuous subcutaneous infusion of octreotide combined with other drugs has proved to be useful in some circumstances in palliative care setting when theoral route is no longer available. Forty-four patients were administered octreotide alone or in combination with other drugs in the same syringe driver for symptom control in advanced cancer patients. Good tolerability and compatibility were observed without visual drug precipitation for a period of 48 hours at room temperature, the standard clinical situation in patients' homes. Such a combination of drugs administered by the subcutaneous route makes possible the adequate control of symptoms in the final days of life.\n\nOctreotide inhibits hepatic fibrosis, bile duct proliferation and bacterial translocation in obstructive jaundice.\n\nPubMed\n\nTÃ¼rkÃ§apar, Nuran; Bayar, Sancar; Koyuncu, Ayhan; Ceyhan, Koray\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe protective effect of octreotide on bacterial translocation, bile duct epithelial proliferation and hepatic fibrosis was studied in an experimental obstructive jaundice model. Forty-five healthy Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group I (n = 15): Median laparotomy and common bile duct manipulation performed (Sham group). Group II (n = 15): Laparotomy and common bile duct ligation performed. Group III (n = 15): After laparotomy and common bile duct ligation octreotide (Sandostatin, sandoz) was given. Simultaneously group I and II received 3 cc 0.9% NaCl and group III received 20 micrograms/kg/daily octreotide subcutaneously every 8 hours during 9 days. Two days after the procedure all rats were opened under ether anesthesia and sterile conditions. Group I had simple laparotomy but group II and III also had common bile duct ligation by 5/0 prolene. Seven days after the surgery (9th day after treatment) all rats underwent laparotomy and tests for bacterial translocation, liver biochemical tests and histopathologic analysis of liver and small bowel were carried out. In group II cecal population levels of bacteria were significantly higher than group I and group III (p < 0.05). In group II there was also statistically significant bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Pathological changes were found in terminal ileum samples in group II which seemed to improve in group III. Hepatocyte function was preserved with octreotide treatment which also significantly decreased bile duct proliferation and periportal fibrosis in response to biliary obstruction. This experimental study showed that octreotide is effective in preventing bacterial translocation, bile duct proliferation and hepatic fibrosis in obstructive jaundice.\n\nLong-term effects of octreotide on pituitary gigantism: its analgesic action on cluster headache.\n\nPubMed\n\nOtsuka, Fumio; Mizobuchi, Satoshi; Ogura, Toshio; Sato, Kenji; Yokoyama, Masataka; Makino, Hirofumi\n\n2004-10-01\n\nWe report the case of 19-year-old man with pituitary gigantism due to growth hormone-producing pituitary macroadenoma. The patient complained of recurrent headache and excessive growth spurt since age 15. Octreotide administration was initiated following transsphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy. Octreotide injection for 4 years efficaciously reduced the size of remnant adenoma as well as serum growth hormone levels. Notably, octreotide exhibited a potent analgesic effect on his intractable cluster headache that has continued even after reduction of the adenoma volume. The analgesic effect lasted 2 to 6 hours after each injection and no tachyphylaxis to octreotide appeared during 4-year treatment. To characterize the headache and the pain intensity, analgesic drugs including octreotide, lidocaine, morphine and thiopental were tested using a visual analogue scale (VAS) evaluation, with the result that octreotide exhibited a prompt and complete disappearance of the headache. Headache relief was in part reproduced by morphine injection (56% reduction) but not by lidocaine or thiopental. The present case suggests that the intractable headache associated with pituitary gigantism is possibly related to the endogenous opioid system. Thus, the headache control by octreotide is clinically helpful for continuation of the self-injection regimen.\n\nA prospective study on the role of octreotide in management of chyle fistula neck.\n\nPubMed\n\nJain, Avani; Singh, Shashank Nath; Singhal, Pawan; Sharma, Man Prakash; Grover, Mohnish\n\n2015-07-01\n\nTo study the effectiveness of octreotide in managing chyle fistula neck and its effect on duration of hospitalization. Prospective study. A total of 19 patients with chyle fistula following neck dissection over a period of 10 years were included in the study. All the patients first underwent conservative management of the chyle leak, including suction drainage, pressure dressings, bed rest, and nutritional modifications. In all of the cases, chyle leak persisted despite conservative management. Octreotide was started in a dose of 100 Âµg subcutaneously every 8 hours for 5 days in cases with low-output leaks and for 7 days in cases with high-output leaks. In all of the cases, the duration of chyle leak after starting treatment with octreotide and the duration of hospitalization was recorded. Chyle leak stopped in all the cases using octreotide. The mean duration of hospitalization was 13.8 days. Chyle leak stopped within 5 days of starting octreotide in the low-output cases and within 7 days in the high-output cases. This permitted early resumption of a regular oral diet and reduced morbidity associated with chyle fistula. The rapid response and minimal side effect profile make octreotide a promising addition to the medical management of a chyle fistula.

Medical treatments generally gave frustrating results in advanced HCC especially if comorbidities exist. Several biologic non-chemotherapeutic drugs are currently tested in HCC and, among them, octreotide was evaluated in single series of HCC patients reporting conflicting results. We have treated a series of 35 patients affected by advanced HCC (26 M and 9 F; age range: 55-85 years, median: 73 years) with RFA followed by octreotide to primarily evaluate the safety of combined treatment and to give preliminary evaluation on its activity. We have also evaluated serum VEGF changes during the study. Child A and Child B represented 60% and about 34% of the cases, respectively. Only two patients with Child C compensated cirrhosis were included in this study. All patients have multiple liver HCC nodules and one had bone metastases. Two complete responses, 3 partial responses and 23 disease stabilization for at least three months were obtained (overall response rate, 14,2%; clinical benefit, 80%). Mean overall survival was 31.4 months. The combined treatment was well tolerated. Statistically significant correlation was found between serum VEGF and tumor progression. In conclusion, the combination of RFA and octreotide was active in advanced HCC, however, confirmation in a larger series is required.\n\n[Treatment of acromegaly with octreotide LAR].\n\nPubMed\n\nSosa, Ernesto; Espinosa-de-los-Monteros, Ana Laura; GonzÃ¡lez, Baldomero; Vargas, Guadalupe; Mier, Fernando; Mercado, MoisÃ©s\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTreatment of acromegaly with somastostatin analogues, albeit highly effective, is not curative and its elevated cost represents a major disadvantage. Hereby we describe our Center's experience using a fixed, 20 mg q.4 weeks- dose of octreotide LAR. 97 patients, 69 females, 71 with macroadenomas, treated with 20-mg im injections of octreotide LAR every 4 weeks, in 23 as primary therapy. No dose escalation was allowed. Patients were evaluated with GH and IGF-1 levels at 4 weeks after the third injection; thereafter, assessments occurred at 3 to 6 months intervals. In 27 unselected patients, evaluations were also performed 6 weeks after the SA injection. A GH concentration < 2.5 ng/mL was reached by 71%, 75% and 83% of patients at the 3rd , 6th and 12th months of follow up respectively, whereas over 30% achieved an IGF-1 index < or = 1.0 at each of these time points, and both biochemical goals were achieved by 30%, 33% and 32% of patients at the same time points. Biochemical success was the same for those patients treated primarily and those treated secondarily and prior radiation made no difference. A baseline GH level > 10 ng/mL was associated with a poor response. A biochemical control rate comparable with other published series it is feasible to reach with the treatment with a fixed dose of 20 mg.\n\n68Ga DOTA-TATE PET/CT allows tumor localization in patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia but negative 111In-octreotide SPECT/CT.\n\nPubMed\n\nBreer, Stefan; Brunkhorst, Thomas; Beil, F Timo; Peldschus, Kersten; Heiland, Max; Klutmann, Susanne; Barvencik, Florian; Zustin, Jozef; Gratz, Klaus-Friedrich; Amling, Michael\n\n2014-07-01\n\nTumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia and low calcitriol levels as well as clinical symptoms like diffuse bone and muscle pain, fatigue fractures or increased fracture risk. Conventional imaging methods, however, often fail to detect the small tumors. Lately, tumor localization clearly improved by somatostatin-receptor (SSTR) imaging, such as octreotide scintigraphy or octreotide SPECT/CT. However, recent studies revealed that still a large number of tumors remained undetected by octreotide imaging. Hence, studies focused on different SSTR imaging methods such as 68Ga DOTA-NOC, 68Ga DOTA-TOC and 68Ga DOTA-TATE PET/CT with promising first results. Studies comparing different SSTR imaging methods for tumor localization in TIO are rare and thus little is known about diagnostic alternatives once a particular method failed to detect a tumor in patients with TIO. Here, we report the data of 5 consecutive patients suffering from TIO, who underwent both 111Indium-octreotide scintigraphy (111In-OCT) SPECT/CT as well as 68Ga DOTA-TATE PET/CT for tumor detection. While 111In-OCT SPECT/CT allowed tumor detection in only 1 of 5 patients, 68Ga DOTA-TATE PET/CT was able to localize the tumor in all patients. Afterwards, anatomical imaging of the region of interest was performed with CT and MRI. Thus, successful surgical resection of the tumor was achieved in all patients. Serum phosphate levels returned to normal and all patients reported relief of symptoms within weeks. Moreover, an iliac crest biopsy was obtained from every patient and revealed marked osteomalacia in all cases. Follow-up DXA revealed an increase in BMD of up to 34.5% 1-year postoperative, indicating remineralization. No recurrence was observed. In conclusion our data indicates that 68Ga DOTA-TATE PET/CT is an effective and promising diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of TIO, even in patients in whom 111In-OCT prior failed to detect\n\n[Octreotide treatment for postoperative chylous ascites in an adult].\n\nPubMed\n\nSenosiain Lalastra, Carla; MartÃ­nez GonzÃ¡lez, Javier; Mesonero Gismero, Francisco; Moreira Vicente, VÃ­ctor\n\n2012-10-01\n\nChylous ascites is infequent after abdominal surgery. We describe the case of a 43-year-old man with portal cavernomatosis who underwent surgery to insert a splenorenal shunt, which was not placed due to the absence of signs of portal hypertension. On postoperative day 20, the patient developed abdominal distension and mild dyspnea and was diagnosed with chylous ascites, which was related to the surgery. The patient was initially treated with diet and diuretics, with no clinical response, and consequently octreotide therapy was started. Four days later, the ascites was almost resolved and an ultrasound scan at 4 months showed its complete disappearance.

With IRB approval, charts of all patients with GEP-NET who received S-LAR between June 2002 to September 2007 at Roswell Park Cancer Institute were reviewed and their data analyzed. Fifty-four patients with GEP-NET received S-LAR; thirty required dose escalation. Patients received a median of 5 doses of S-LAR at conventional dose followed by up-titration of the dose for symptom control (20) and radiological progression (17). Median high dose of S-LAR was 40 mg (range: 40-90 mg) with a median of 8.5 high doses received. No treatment related toxicities were seen. The estimated 1-year survival for patients on conventional dose alone was 0.77 (95% CI of 0.50 to 0.91) and those on high-dose was 0.88 (95% CI of 0.68 to 0.96) (p=0.4777) while median time to any other intervention was 2.9 months versus 17.7 months (p=0.12). Dose escalation of S-LAR is well tolerated and may provide longer disease control.\n\nOctreotide and pasireotide (dis)similarly inhibit pituitary tumor cells in vitro.\n\nPubMed\n\nIbÃ¡Ã±ez-Costa, Alejandro; Rivero-CortÃ©s, Esther; VÃ¡zquez-Borrego, Mari C; Gahete, Manuel D; JimÃ©nez-Reina, Luis; Venegas-Moreno, Eva; de la Riva, AndrÃ©s; ArrÃ¡ez, Miguel Ãngel; GonzÃ¡lez-Molero, Inmaculada; Schmid, Herbert A; Maraver-Selfa, Silvia; GavilÃ¡n-Villarejo, Inmaculada; GarcÃ­a-ArnÃ©s, Juan Antonio; JapÃ³n, Miguel A; Soto-Moreno, Alfonso; GÃ¡lvez, MarÃ­a A; Luque, RaÃºl M; CastaÃ±o, Justo P\n\n2016-11-01\n\nSomatostatin analogs (SSA) are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment for pituitary adenomas. However, some patients escape from therapy with octreotide, a somatostatin receptor 2 (sst2)-preferring SSA, and pasireotide, a novel multi-sst-preferring SSA, may help to overcome this problem. It has been proposed that correspondence between sst1-sst5 expression pattern and SSA-binding profile could predict patient's response. To explore the cellular/molecular features associated with octreotide/pasireotide response, we performed a parallel comparison of their in vitro effects, evaluating sst1-sst5 expression, intracellular Ca 2+ signaling ([Ca 2+ ] i ), hormone secretion and cell viability, in a series of 85 pituitary samples. Somatotropinomas expressed sst5>sst2, yet octreotide reduced [Ca 2+ ] i more efficiently than pasireotide, while both SSA similarly decreased growth hormone release/expression and viability. Corticotropinomas predominantly expressed sst5, but displayed limited response to pasireotide, while octreotide reduced functional endpoints. Non-functioning adenomas preferentially expressed sst3 but, surprisingly, both SSA increased cell viability. Prolactinomas mainly expressed sst1 but were virtually unresponsive to SSA. Finally, both SSA decreased [Ca 2+ ] i in normal pituitaries. In conclusion, both SSA act in vitro on pituitary adenomas exerting both similar and distinct effects; however, no evident correspondence was found with the sst1-sst5 profile. Thus, it seems plausible that additional factors, besides the simple abundance of a given sst, critically influence the SSA response.

To establish the remission rates (normal IGF-1 for age/sex: IGF-1Â â¤Â 1.00 xULN) after withdrawal of combined treatment with octreotide LAR and cabergoline and of cabergoline alone, we prospectively studied 16 patients with acromegaly controlled by those treatments in the preceding 2Â years as part of a larger study on remission of acromegaly after withdrawal of different medical treatments. Among 97 patients with controlled acromegaly included in the entire study, only 16 patients had been on combination therapy (nÂ =Â 12) or cabergoline alone (nÂ =Â 4). At 8Â weeks after treatment withdrawal, three patients (19%) were in remission (short-term remission). At 60Â weeks (long-term remission), IGF-1 levels were still in the normal range in two patients (12.5%) and remained normal up to 108Â weeks after treatment withdrawal (last visit). One patient had been treated with cabergoline alone and another one with combination of octreotide and cabergoline before treatment withdrawal. Remission of acromegaly after treatment withdrawal seems to be uncommon in patients controlled by cabergoline, either as monotherapy or in combination with octreotide. In the future, larger studies and/or meta-analysis will be necessary to accurately establish the remission rates of acromegaly after withdrawal of cabergoline with or without somatostatin analogs.\n\nChange in quality of life in patients with acromegaly after treatment with octreotide LAR: first application of AcroQoL in Korea\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChin, Sang Ouk; Chung, Choon Hee; Chung, Yoon-Sok; Kim, Byung-Joon; Kim, Hee Young; Kim, In-Ju; Kim, Jung Guk; Kim, Min-Seon; Kim, Seong-Yeon; Lee, Eun Jig; Lee, Ki Young; Kim, Sung-Woon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives This study was designed to investigate changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with acromegaly in Korea after medical treatment with octreotide LAR using the validated Korean version of the acromegaly quality of life questionnaire (AcroQoL). Design A prospective, open-label, single-arm study. Setting 11 tertiary centres in Korea. Participants 58 Korean patients (aged 21â72â years) who were newly diagnosed with acromegaly between 2009 and 2012 were prescribed octreotide LAR 20â mg at the time of enrolment. During 24â weeks of observation, AcroQoL survey questionnaires and measurement of growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 1(GH/IGF-I) were performed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Main outcome measures We assessed the HRQoL of Korean patients with acromegaly after medical treatment with octreotide LAR using the validated Korean version of the AcroQoL questionnaire. Results Patients had a mean age of 47.2â years (29 males), and GH and IGF-I significantly decreased during the first 12â weeks (GH: 4.8 vs 1.9â Î¼g/L, p<0.001; IGF-I: 497 vs 265â Î¼g/L, p<0.001), but showed insignificant change at week 24 (GH: 2.3â Î¼g/L; IGF-I: 294â Î¼g/L). Only AcroQoL scores for the psychological appearance subdomain showed a significant increase during the entire 24â weeks (p<0.05). The change in the psychological appearance subdomain of AcroQoL scores demonstrated a significant but weak negative correlation with change in IGF-I levels (r=â0.282, p=0.039). When patients were divided into two groups according to their disease activity at week 24 (controlled vs uncontrolled), there was no difference in AcroQoL scores, but the psychological appearance subdomain of the two groups appeared to change differently over the entire 24-week period (p=0.047). Conclusions: Medical treatment with octreotide LAR in patients with acromegaly has a limited contribution to HRQoL as assessed by the AcroQoL.

Parenteral use of octreotide may be indicated if unresponsive to diazoxide. There is limited data on use of octreotide in BWS. Chart review describing 2 cases with BWS and hypoglycemia treated with long acting Octreotide as a monthly injection. We describe two unrelated females born large for gestational age found to have clinical features consistent with BWS, who developed severe hypoglycemia. Genetic diagnosis of BWS was confirmed. The first patient was born at 37Â weeks and developed hypoglycemia shortly after birth. She was initially started on diazoxide but developed pulmonary congestion and was therefore switched to depot octreotide (LAR). She maintained euglycemia with LAR. In the second patient (born at 26-4/7Â weeks), onset of hypoglycemia was delayed till 11Â weeks of age due to hydrocortisone (indicated hemodynamically) and continuous feeding, and was partially responsive to diazoxide. She was switched to octreotide 4 times daily, treated till at age 18Â months. Despite frequent feeds, she required treatment again between ages 4-6.5Â years, initially with diazoxide but due to severe hypertrichosis she was switched to LAR with an excellent response. Both patients treated with LAR for over two years achieved euglycemia above 70Â mg/dl and had normal height gain, without side effects. Successful treatment of hypoglycemia can be achieved and maintained with LAR in infants and children with BWS who are either resistant or cannot tolerate diazoxide.\n\n[Monosymptomatic hyperthyroidism and TSH-producing adenoma: successful therapy with octreotide].\n\nPubMed\n\nMayinger, B; Axelos, D; Pavel, M; Hahn, E G; Hensen, J\n\n1999-01-29\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system was performed on a 72-year-old woman who was hyperthyroid without suppression of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and had complained of a recent onset of headaches. MRI demonstrated a space-occupying lesion, 1 cm in diameter, in the anterior pituitary. The clinical symptoms were marked by a long-standing monosymptomatic illness of rapidly changing mood swings with depressive and manic phases. Endocrinological-biochemical tests showed hyperthyroidism (fT3 10.55 pmol/l and fT4 39 pmol/l) but no TSH suppression (TSH: 2.9 microU/ml). Octreotide scintigraphy documented an activity-rich area in the anterior pituitary and the upper anterior mediastinum. Mediastinal MRI revealed a 5 cm space-occupying mass lying on the right atrium. 131I scintigraphy identified the mass as a retrosternal goitre. As an operation on the anterior pituitary would have carried a high risk for the patient who was in a poor general condition and she had refused to be operated, treatment with octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, was initiated. This achieved a euthyroid state with partly suppressed TSH, and the patient's emotional swings ceased. If hyperthyroidism coexists with non-suppressed TSH levels, a TSH-producing hypophyseal adenoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis despite its rarity. Octreotide administration is an effective and safe treatment and is the method of choice, especially when there are contraindications to surgical resection of the anterior pituitary.\n\nYttrium-90 and indium-111 labelling, receptor binding and biodistribution of [DOTA0,d-Phe1,Tyr3]octreotide, a promising somatostatin analogue for radionuclide therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Jong, M; Bakker, W H; Krenning, E P; Breeman, W A; van der Pluijm, M E; Bernard, B F; Visser, T J; Jermann, E; BÃ©hÃ©, M; Powell, P; MÃ¤cke, H R\n\n1997-04-01\n\nIn vitro octreotide receptor binding of [111In-DOTA0,d-Phe1, Tyr3]octreotide (111In-DOTATOC) and the in vivo metabolism of 90Y- or 111In-labelled DOTATOC were investigated in rats in comparison with [111In-DTPA0]octreotide [111In-DTPAOC). 111In-DOTATOC was found to have an affinity similar to octreotide itself for the octreotide receptor in rat cerebral cortex microsomes. Twenty-four hours after injection of 90Y- or 111In-labelled DOTATOC, uptake of radioactivity in the octreotide receptor-expressing tissues pancreas, pituitary, adrenals and tumour was a factor of 2-6 that after injection of 111In-DTPAOC. Uptake of labelled DOTATOC in pituitary, pancreas, adrenals and tumour was almost completely blocked by pretreatment with 0.5 mg unlabelled octreotide, indicating specific binding to the octreotide receptors. These findings strongly indicate that 90Y-DOTATOC is a promising radiopharmaceutical for radiotherapy and that 111In-DOTATOC is of potential value for diagnosis of patients with octreotide receptor-positive lesions, such as most neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nAdditional Octreotide Therapy to Sirolimus Achieved a Decrease in Sirolimus-refractory Chylous Effusion Complicated with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nNamba, Masashi; Masuda, Takeshi; Nakamura, Takashi; Horimasu, Yasushi; Miyamoto, Shintaro; Nakashima, Taku; Iwamoto, Hiroshi; Fujitaka, Kazunori; Hamada, Hironobu; Hattori, Noboru\n\n2017-12-15\n\nRecently, sirolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, was reported to decrease chylous effusion in patients with lymphangioleimyomatosis (LAM). We herein report a case of a 34-year-old woman with LAM who developed refractory chylothorax and chylous ascites during sirolimus therapy. In this case, to reduce chylous effusion, we administered octreotide, which is often used to control postoperative chylous effusion, in addition to the sirolimus therapy. This combination therapy reduced the chylothorax and chylous ascites. For patients with LAM, octreotide therapy in addition to sirolimus may be effective for treating sirolimus-refractory chylous effusion.\n\nComparison of 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC and HYNIC-TATE octreotide scintigraphy with FDG PET and 99mTc-MIBI in local recurrent or distant metastatic thyroid cancers.\n\nPubMed\n\nSager, Sait; Kabasakal, Levent; Halac, Metin; Maecke, Helmut; Uslu, Lebriz; Ãnsel, Ãetin; Kanmaz, Bedii\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThere have been various studies for early diagnosis of local recurrent or distant metastatic thyroid cancers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC and 99mTc-HYNIC-TATE, octreotide derivatives, to detect recurrences or distant metastases in 131I-negative thyroglobulin positive thyroid cancer patients and to compare the lesions with FDG PET and 99mTc-MIBI studies in the same patient group. Twenty differentiated thyroid cancer patients, 7 male and 13 female, mean age 54.6 Â± 15.3 (range 13-78 years), were included in this study. Eighteen patients had papillary thyroid cancer and 2 had follicular thyroid cancer. Fifteen patients received HYNIC-TOC and 5 patients received HYNIC-TATE as a radiopharmaceutical. All patients underwent whole-body scan 1 and 4 hours after injection of octreotide derivatives and SPECT imagings were performed from the suspicious sites. The lesions that were seen in 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC and 99mTc-HYNIC-TATE studies were compared with 99mTc-MIBI and FDG-PET studies. Among 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC and 99mTc-HYNIC-TATE scintigraphies, 15 patient studies were evaluated as true positive (75%) and 5 were false negative (25%). The total number of lesions in octreotide scintigraphy was 48 in 20 patients. Of 20 patients, 19 had FDG-PET study, 15 of them were evaluated as true positive (78.9%), and 4 them were evaluated as false negative (21.1%). Total number of lesions in FDG PET was 74. 99mTc-MIBI study was positive in 11 patients (55%) and negative in 9 patients (45%). Total number of lesions in 99mTc-MIBI was 25. Technetium-labeled somatostatin receptor scintigraphy analogues HYNIC-TOC and HYNIC-TATE are useful imaging alternatives in somatostatin receptor expressing thyroid cancer patients. Radiolabeling is easy and they are readily available for routine use.\n\nBlood Glucose and Insulin Concentrations after Octreotide Administration in Horses With Insulin Dysregulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrank, N; Hermida, P; Sanchez-LondoÃ±o, A; Singh, R; Gradil, C M; Uricchio, C K\n\n2017-07-01\n\nOctreotide is a somatostatin analog that suppresses insulin secretion. We hypothesized that octreotide would suppress insulin concentrations in horses and that normal (N) horses and those with insulin dysregulation (ID) would differ significantly in their plasma glucose and insulin responses to administration of octreotide. Twelve horses, N = 5, ID = 7. Prospective study. An oral sugar test was performed to assign horses to N and ID groups. Octreotide (1.0 Î¼g/kg IV) was then administered, and blood was collected at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 minute, and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hour for measurement of glucose and insulin concentrations. Area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated. Mean AUC values for glucose and insulin did not differ between normal (n = 5) and ID (n = 7) groups after octreotide injection. Significant time (P < .001) effects were detected for glucose and insulin concentrations. A group Ã time interaction (P = .091) was detected for insulin concentrations after administration of octreotide, but the group (P = .33) effect was not significant. Octreotide suppresses insulin secretion, resulting in hyperglycemia, and then concentrations increase above baseline as glycemic control is restored. Our hypothesis that octreotide causes insulin concentrations to decrease in horses was supported, but differences between N and ID groups did not reach statistical significance when blood glucose and insulin responses were compared. The utility of an octreotide response test remains to be determined. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.

We described a clinical course of a 15-year-old boy of McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) with pituitary gigantism. At the age of 8 years, a growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) producing pituitary adenoma was diagnosed at our hospital. He also had multiple fibrous dysplasia, so that he was diagnosed as having MAS. The tumor was partially resected, and GNAS1 gene mutation (R201C) was identified in affected tissues. We introduced octreotide to suppress GH secretion (100 mug 2/day s.c). During therapy with octreotide, IGF-1 and GH levels could not be suppressed and the patient frequently complained of nausea from octreotide treatment. Therefore, the therapy was changed to monthly injections of octreotide-LAR at the age of 12.3 years and was partially effective. However, as defect of left visual field worsened due to progressive left optic canal stenosis, he underwent second neurological decompression of the left optic nerve at 13.4 years of age. After surgery, in addition to octreotide-LAR, cabergoline (0.25 mg twice a month) was started. This regimen normalized serum levels of GH and IGF-1; however, he showed impaired glucose tolerance and gallstones at 15.7 years of age. Therefore, the dose of octreotide-LAR was reduced to 10 mg and the dose of cabergoline increased. This case demonstrated the difficulty of treating pituitary gigantism due to MAS. The use of octreotide-LAR and cabergoline should be considered even in pediatric patients; however, adverse events due to octreotide-LAR must be carefully examined.\n\n99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC: a new 99mTc-labelled radiopharmaceutical for imaging somatostatin receptor-positive tumours; first clinical results and intra-patient comparison with 111In-labelled octreotide derivatives.\n\nPubMed\n\nDecristoforo, C; Mather, S J; Cholewinski, W; Donnemiller, E; Riccabona, G; Moncayo, R\n\n2000-09-01\n\n[111In-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid-D-Phe1]-octreotide (DTPA-octreotide) scintigraphy has gained widespread acceptance as a diagnostic clinical procedure in oncology for imaging somatostatin receptor-positive tumours. However, indium-111 as a radiolabel has several drawbacks, including limited availability, suboptimal gamma energy and high radiation burden to the patient. We have recently reported on the preclinical development of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC, a new octreotide derivative which showed promising results both in vitro and in vivo. We now report our initial clinical experiences with this new radiopharmaceutical in ten oncological patients. The clinical diagnoses were: carcinoid syndrome (n=5), thyroid cancer (n=3), pancreatic cancer (n=1) and pituitary tumour (n=1). The biodistribution and kinetics of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC were compared with those of 111In-DTPA-octreotide in six cases, and with those of 111In-DOTA-TOC in five cases. With the new tracer tumours were imaged within 15 min after injection and showed the highest target/non-target ratios 4 h after injection. Tumour uptake persisted up to 20 h p.i. The rate of blood clearance was similar to that of 111In-DTPA-octreotide but faster than that of 111In-DOTA-TOC, while urinary excretion was lower compared with the 111In derivatives. Semi-quantitative region of interest analysis showed that 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC produced higher tumour/organ (target/non-target) ratios than the 111In derivatives, especially in relation to heart and muscle. Significantly more lesions could be detected in 99mTc images. We conclude that 99mTcEDDA/HYNIC-TOC shows better imaging properties for the identification of somatostatin receptor-positive tumour sites than currently available 111In-labelled octreotide derivatives.\n\nFive-year follow-up of a 13-year-old boy with a pituitary adenoma causing gigantism--effect of octreotide therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchoof, Ellen; DÃ¶rr, Helmuth G; Kiess, Wieland; LÃ¼decke, Dieter K; Freitag, Eduard; Zindel, Volker; Rascher, Wolfgang; DÃ¶tsch, JÃ¶rg\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIn children, there is little experience with octreotide therapy for pituitary tumors, especially growth hormone (GH) producing adenomas. We report on a 13-year-old boy with gigantism due to a GH-producing pituitary adenoma caused by a Gsalpha mutation on the basis of McCune-Albright syndrome. At the age of 6.5 years a GH- and prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma was diagnosed. The adenoma was surgically removed. Immediately thereafter, the small adenoma residuum was treated with octreotide (2 x 100 microg/day s.c.). During therapy with octreotide, the growth rate dropped to normal values; however, rose again after 2 years of treatment. The insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels remained above the 95th percentile, the GH level mostly >2 microg/l. After 5 years of octreotide therapy, GH (6.9 microg/l), IGF-I (620 microg/l), IGF-binding protein 3 (5.4 mg/l), and prolactin (17.0 ng/ml) levels were still elevated. The growth velocity was +2.4 SDS (standard deviation score), the pubertal status was mature, and the bone age was 14.3 years (prospective final height 208 cm). A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an unchanged residual 4-mm rim of adenoma at the pituitary site. Side effects from octreotide therapy were not reported by the patient or his family. The therapy was changed to the long-acting release octreotide analog octreotide-LAR. After 1 year of treatment with octreotide-LAR, the GH level was 1.0 microg/l, and the prospective final height dropped by 10 cm. This case demonstrates that combined surgical and medical treatment can influence the prognosis of childhood gigantism; however, the prognosis of this rare condition remains uncertain.

To prevent unnecessary radiation exposure during their clinical application, the present study aimed to develop radiolabeled peptides which could reduce radioactivity levels in the kidney at both early and late post-injection time points by introducing a negative charge with an acidic amino acid such as L-aspartic acid (Asp) at a suitable position in 111 In-DTPA-conjugated octreotide derivatives. Biodistribution of the radioactivity was evaluated in normal mice after administration of a novel radiolabeled peptide by a counting method. The radiolabeled species remaining in the kidney were identified by comparing their HPLC data with those obtained by alternative synthesis. The designed and synthesized radiolabeled peptide 111 In-DTPA-d-Phe -1 -Asp 0 -d-Phe 1 -octreotide exhibited significantly lower renal radioactivity levels than those of the known 111 In-DTPA-d-Phe 1 -octreotide at 3 and 24h post-injection. The radiolabeled species in the kidney at 24h after the injection of new octreotide derivative represented 111 In-DTPA-d-Phe-OH and 111 In-DTPA-d-Phe-Asp-OH as the metabolites. Their radiometabolites and intact 111 In-DTPA-conjugated octreotide derivative were observed in urine within 24h post-injection. The present study provided a new example of an 111 In-DTPA-conjugated octreotide derivative having the characteristics of both reduced renal uptake and shortened residence time of radioactivity in the kidney. It is considered that this kinetic control was achieved by introducing a negative charge on the octreotide derivative thereby suppressing the reabsorption in the renal tubules and affording the radiometabolites with appropriate lipophilicity.

The main attention was directed toward a potential correlation between the rate of internalization and the tumor or pancreas uptake. Synthesis was performed on solid phase using a standard Fmoc strategy. Internalization was studied in cell culture (AR4-2J) and biodistribution was studied using a Lewis rat tumor model (AR4-2J). The 5 radiopeptides showed a specific internalization into AR4-2J cells in culture (as shown by blocking experiments). The rate of internalization of the 5 radiopeptides differed significantly according to the following order: (99m)Tc-(1) approximately = [(111)In-DTPA]-OC < (99m)Tc-(2) < (99m)Tc-(3) approximately = [(111)In-DOTA]-TATE. All radiopeptides displayed a rapid blood clearance and a fast clearance from all somatostatin receptor-negative tissues predominantly via the kidneys. A receptor-specific uptake of radioactivity was observed for all compounds in somatostatin receptor-positive organs such as the pancreas, the adrenals, and the stomach.

In kidney perfusion experiments, the renal clearance value of (99m)Tc-octreotide was three times lower than that of (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. The predominant renal excretion of (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC was associated with a high and long-term renal accumulation up to 48 hrs. Microautoradiographic results indicated that (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC was retained mainly in the renal medulla within the cells of the collecting ducts and in the surrounding tissue. Lower positivity was found in the proximal and distal tubular cells. We conclude that the mechanism of renal accumulation of somatostatin analogues renal accumulation is complex and that proximal tubular reabsorption is probably not the main mechanism for uptake of (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC in the kidneys. The presence of the somatostatin receptors, differences in the tonicity level within kidneys and other possible mechanisms could participate in their renal accumulation.\n\nSuccessful treatment of canine necrolytic migratory erythema (superficial necrolytic dermatitis) due to metastatic glucagonoma with octreotide.\n\nPubMed\n\nOberkirchner, Ursula; Linder, Keith E; Zadrozny, Leah; Olivry, Thierry\n\n2010-10-01\n\nNecrolytic migratory erythema (NME; also known as superficial necrolytic dermatitis) is a syndrome most often associated with certain chronic liver diseases or pancreatic glucagonomas. In humans with glucagonoma-associated NME, skin lesions usually respond to octreotide, a somatostatin analogue that inhibits glucagon release. In this report an 11-year-old golden retriever dog with pancreatic glucagonoma and metastasis to the regional lymph nodes, spleen and liver was diagnosed with NME. The dog exhibited erosions, ulcers and crusts on the paws, pressure points, muzzle, periocular area and prepuce. The dog was also anorexic and had difficulty walking. Because metastasis precluded surgery, treatment was initiated with subcutaneous octreotide (2 Î¼g/kg twice daily). Skin lesions and systemic clinical signs improved markedly within 5 days. The dosage was increased to nearly 3 Î¼g/kg twice daily and signs almost completely resolved within 10 days. Anorexia was the major adverse effect observed. During the following month, both dosage (1-3.7 Î¼g/kg) and frequency (two to four times daily) of the octreotide injections were adjusted to permit control of clinical signs while maintaining adequate appetite. Temporary cessation of octreotide administration resulted in the rapid recurrence of skin lesions. Resuming injections led to improvement of clinical signs within 48 h. The dog was later euthanized because of progressive metastatic disease. In conclusion, subcutaneous octreotide injections were beneficial in this dog with glucagonoma-associated NME. This somatostatin analogue could be a valuable option to treat canine patients with non-resectable or relapsing pancreatic glucagonoma-associated NME. Â© 2010 The Authors.

Medical treatment of chylothorax was reported in the past, but there is still considerable controversy on the appropriate management strategies. Two patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy, 2-field lymph node dissection, and resection of thoracic duct together with ileocolic reconstruction via the retrosternal route at our hospital. Chylothorax developed on the 32nd postoperative day (POD) in 1 patient and the 12th POD in the other, manifesting as a change in the character of thoracic drainage to turbid white. Both were immediately started on octreotide (300âÎ¼g/ day) and etilefrine (120âmg/day). When the amount of pleural effusion decreased to <50âmL/day, we performed pleurodesis with Picibanil (OK432). Thereafter, the patients gradually made satisfactory progress and resumed oral food intake, and the thoracotomy tubes were eventually removed. They have remained recurrence-free at the time of writing. In this report, we demonstrated the clinical efficacy of etilefrine for the management of postesophagectomy chylothorax. New medical treatment options for this condition are now broad and the usefulness of combined therapy consisting of a sclerosing agent, etilefrine, and octreotide is underscored, regardless of the status of the thoracic duct.

The resulting mineral homeostasis abnormalities and skeletal manifestations can be reversed with surgical resection of the tumor. Unfortunately, PMTs are often difficult to locate, and medical treatment with oral phosphate and vitamin D analogues is either insufficient to manage the disease or not tolerated. Octreotide has been proposed as a potential treatment for TIO due to the presence of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) on PMTs; however, the role of somatostatin signaling in PMTs and the efficacy of treatment of TIOs with somatostatin analogues is not clear. In an effort to evaluate the efficacy of octreotide therapy in TIO, five subjects with TIO were treated with octreotide for 3 days. Blood intact FGF23, phosphate, and 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , and tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) were measured at frequent time points during treatment. Octreotide's effects were assessed by comparing group means of the biochemical parameters at each time-point to mean baseline values. There were no significant changes in blood phosphate, FGF23, 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , or TRP during octreotide treatment, consistent with a lack of efficacy of octreotide in treating TIO.

Methods: This quassi experimental study was carried out in Medical Department in collaboration with Radiology Department of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center Karachi Pakistan from September 10, 2015 to February 5, 2016. Cases were selected from patients admitted in Medical Wards and those attending Medical OPD. Diagnosis of cirrhosis was confirmed by Clinical Examination and Lab & Imaging investigation in Medical Department. Doppler waveform study was done by experienced radiologist in Radiology Department before and after administration of octreotide. Doppler signals were obtained from the right hepatic vein. Waveform tracings were recorded for five seconds and categorized as âmonophasicâ, âbiphasicâ and âtriphasicâ. Waveform changes from one waveform to other were noted and analyzed. Results: Significant change i.e. from âmonophasicâ to âbiphasicâ or âbiphasicâ to âtriphasicâ was seen in 56% cases while âmonophasicâ to âtriphasicâ was seen in 20% cases. No change was seen in 24% cases. Improvement in waveform reflects lowering of portal vein pressure. Conclusion: Non invasive Hepatic vein Doppler waveform study showed improvement in Doppler waveform after administration of octreotide in 76% cases. Doppler waveform study has the potential of becoming non invasive âfollow up toolâ of choice for assessing portal pressure in patients having variceal bleed due to portal hypertension.

If this suggestion is true, maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity by a cytoprotective agent, a-tocopherol, and inhibition of gastrointestinal secretions by octreotide should decrease the incidence of bacterial translocation and extent of mucosal injury due to intestinal obstruction. Complete intestinal obstruction was created in the distal ileum of male Wistar Albino rats by a single 3-0 silk suture. The animals received subcutaneous injections of 1 ml of physiologic saline (group 1) (PS 24) and 1 ml of saline containing octreotide acetate (100 micrograms/kg) (group 2) (OC 24), at 0, 12 and 24 hours of obstruction. In group 3 (PS 48) and group 4 (OC 48), the rats were treated with subcutaneous physiologic saline (1 ml) and octreotide acetate (100 micrograms/kg), respectively, beginning at the time of obstruction and every 12 hours for 48 hours. The rats in group 5 (Toc 24), were pretreated with intramuscular a-tocopherol 500 mg/kg on day 1 and 8, and underwent laparotomy on day 9. A third dose of a-tocopherol was injected at the time of obstruction on day 9 and no treatment was given thereafter. We tested the incidence of bacterial translocation in systemic organs and circulation and evaluated the histopathological changes in all groups. Treatment with octreotide acetate was found to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of translocation, with no histopathological improvement. Mucosal damage scores, on the other hand, in the a-tocopherol group were statistically less than those in the octreotide and control groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, a-tocopherol treatment decreased the incidence of organ invasion with translocating bacteria, although this difference did not reach statistical significance.

Medical therapy with somatostatin analogues (SSAs) effectively reduces TSH secretion in approximately 80% of patients and induces shrinkage in about 45% of tumors. According with previous data, resistance to SSA treatment might be due to heterogeneity in somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) expression. We report the case of TSHoma in a 41-year-old man treated with octreotide LAR that caused a dramatic decrease of TSH and thyroid hormones and tumor shrinkage already after 3 months of pre-surgical therapy. In search of potential molecular determinants of octreotide effectiveness, we measured, in primary cultures from this tumor, SSTR and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) expression, and octreotide and/or cabergoline effects on TSH secretion and cell proliferation. SSTR5 and D2R expression was higher than SSTR2. Octreotide significantly inhibited TSH secretion more effectively than cabergoline (P<0.001), whereas the combined treatment was comparable with cabergoline alone. Similarly, octreotide resulted more effective than cabergoline on cell proliferation, while the combination did not show any additive or synergistic effects. In conclusion, the significant antisecretive and antiproliferative effect of octreotide in th"
