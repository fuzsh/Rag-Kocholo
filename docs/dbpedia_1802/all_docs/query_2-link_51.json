        "text": "Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling by n-terminal SH2 domain mutants of the p85Î± regulatory subunit of PI3K is enhanced by deletion of its c-terminal SH2 domain.\n\nPubMed\n\nHofmann, Bianca T; JÃ¼cker, Manfred\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is frequently activated in human cancer cells due to gain of function mutations in the catalytic (p110) and the regulatory (p85) subunits. The regulatory subunit consists of an SH3 domain and two SH2 domains. An oncogenic form of p85Î± named p65 lacking the c-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) has been cloned from an irradiation-induced murine thymic lymphoma and transgenic mice expressing p65 in T lymphocytes develop a lymphoproliferative disorder. We have recently detected a c-terminal truncated form of p85Î± named p76Î± in a human lymphoma cell line lacking most of the cSH2 domain due to a frame shift mutation. Here, we report that the deletion of the cSH2 domain enhances the activating effects of the n-terminal SH2 domain (nSH2) mutants K379E and R340E on the PI3K/Akt pathway and micro tumor formation in a focus assay. Further analysis revealed that this transforming effect is mediated by activation of the catalytic PI3K isoform p110Î± and downstream signaling through mTOR. Our data further support a mechanistic model in which mutations of the cSH2 domain of p85Î± can abrogate its negative regulatory function on PI3K activity via the nSH2 domain of p85Î±.

The p85 alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, which associates with several receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, also contains two SH2 domains. Both p85 alpha SH2 domains, when expressed individually as fusion proteins in bacteria, bound stably to the activated beta receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Complex formation required PDGF stimulation and was dependent on receptor tyrosine kinase activity. The bacterial p85 alpha SH2 domains recognized activated beta PDGF receptor which had been immobilized on a filter, indicating that SH2 domains contact autophosphorylated receptors directly. Several receptor tyrosine kinases within the PDGF receptor subfamily, including the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor and the Steel factor receptor (Kit), also associate with PI 3-kinase in vivo. Bacterially expressed SH2 domains derived from the p85 alpha subunit of PI 3-kinase bound in vitro to the activated colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor and to Kit. We infer that the SH2 domains of p85 alpha bind to high-affinity sites on these receptors, whose creation is dependent on receptor autophosphorylation. The SH2 domains of p85 are therefore primarily responsible for the binding of PI 3-kinase to activated growth factor receptors.

Although the involvement of p85Î±PI3K SH2 domain in signal transduction has been extensively studied, the function of the SH3 domain at the N-terminus remains elusive. A serine (at codon 83) adjacent to the N-terminal SH3 domain in the PI3K regulatory subunit p85Î±PI3K that is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in vivo and in vitro has been identified. Virtually all receptors binding p85Î±PI3K can cooperate with cAMP-PKA signals via phosphorylation of p85Î±PI3KSer83. To analyse the role of p85Î±PI3KSer83 in retinoic acid (RA) and cAMP signalling, in MCF7 cells, we used p85Î±PI3K mutated forms, in which Ser83 has been substituted with alanine (p85A) to prevent phosphorylation or with aspartic acid (p85D) to mimic the phosphorylated residue. We demonstrated that p85Î±PI3KSer83 is crucial for the synergistic enhancement of RARÎ±/p85Î±PI3K binding induced by cAMP/RA co-treatment in MCF7 cells. Growth curves, colorimetric MTT assay and cell cycle analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of p85Î±PI3KSer83 plays an important role in the control of MCF7 cell proliferation and in RA-induced inhibition of proliferation. Wound healing and transwell experiments demonstrated that p85Î±PI3KSer83 was also essential both for the control of migratory behaviour and for the reduction of motility induced by RA. This study points to p85Î±PI3KSer83 as the physical link between different pathways (cAMP-PKA, RA and FAK), and as an important regulator of MCF7 cell proliferation and migration.\n\nRegulation of the PI3K pathway through a p85Î± monomerâhomodimer equilibrium | Office of Cancer Genomics\n\nCancer.gov\n\nThe canonical action of the p85Î± regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is to associate with the p110Î± catalytic subunit to allow stimuli-dependent activation of the PI3K pathway. We elucidate a p110Î±-independent role of homodimerized p85Î± in the positive regulation of PTEN stability and activity.\n\nSuppression of the PI3K subunit p85Î± delays embryoid body development and inhibits cell adhesion.\n\nPubMed\n\nGurney, Susan M R; Forster, Peter; Just, Ursula; Schwanbeck, Ralf\n\n2011-12-01\n\nPhosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3Ks) exert a variety of signaling functions in eukaryotes. We suppressed the PI3K regulatory subunit p85Î± using a small interfering RNA (Pik3r1 siRNA) and examined the effects on embryoid body (EB) development in hanging drop culture. We observed a 150% increase in the volume of the treated EBs within 24 h, compared to the negative controls. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) assays showed that this increase in volume is not due to increased cellular proliferation. Instead, the increase in volume appears to be due to reduced cellular aggregation and adherence. This is further shown by our observation that 40% of treated EBs form twin instead of single EBs, and that they have a significantly reduced ability to adhere to culture dishes when plated. A time course over the first 96 h reveals that the impaired adherence is transient and explained by an initial 12-hour delay in EB development. Quantitative PCR expression analysis suggests that the adhesion molecule integrin-Î²1 (ITGB1) is transiently downregulated by the p85Î± suppression. In conclusion we found that suppressing p85Î± leads to a delay in forming compact EBs, accompanied by a transient inability of the EBs to undergo normal cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion.

The structure of a p110Î²/p85Î² complex identifies an inhibitory function for the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of the p85 regulatory subunit. Mutagenesis of a cSH2 contact residue activates downstream signaling in cells. This inhibitory contact ties up the C-terminal region of the p110Î² catalytic subunit, which is essential for lipid kinase activity. InÂ vitro, p110Î² basal activity is tightly restrained by contacts with three p85 domains: the cSH2, nSH2, and iSH2. RTK phosphopeptides relieve inhibition by nSH2 and cSH2 using completely different mechanisms. The binding site for the RTK's pYXXM motif is exposed on the cSH2, requiring an extended RTK motif to reach and disrupt the inhibitory contact with p110Î². This contrasts with the nSH2 where the pY-binding site itself forms the inhibitory contact. This establishes an unusual mechanism by which p85 SH2 domains contribute to RTK signaling specificities.

The binding of Axl's ligand, growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6), results in Axl autophosphorylation, recruitment of signaling molecules, and activation of downstream survival pathways. Pull-down assays and immunoprecipitations using wildtype and mutant Axl transfected cells determined that Axl directly binds growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) at pYVN and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3 kinase) at two pYXXM sites (pY779 and pY821). Also, p85 can indirectly bind to Axl via an interaction between p85's second proline-rich region and the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. Further, Grb2 and p85 can compete for binding at the pY821VNM site. Gas6-stimulation of Axl-transfected COS7 cells recruited activated PI3 kinase and phosphorylated Akt. An interaction between Axl, p85 and Grb2 was confirmed in brain homogenates, enriched populations of O4+ oligodendrocytes, and O4â flow-through prepared from day 10 mouse brain, indicating that cells with active Gas6/Axl signal through Grb2 and the PI3 kinase/Akt pathways.

Here we report that deletion of the Pik3r1 gene, encoding the regulatory subunits p85Î±, p55Î±, and p50Î± impairs lymphatic sprouting and maturation, and causes abnormal lymphatic morphology, without major impact on blood vessels. Pik3r1 deletion had the most severe consequences among gut and diaphragm lymphatics, which share the retroperitoneal anlage, initially suggesting that the Pik3r1 role in this vasculature is anlage-dependent. However, whereas lymphatic sprouting toward the diaphragm was arrested, lymphatics invaded the gut, where remodeling and valve formation were impaired. Thus, cell-origin fails to explain the phenotype. Only the gut showed lymphangiectasia, lymphatic up-regulation of the TGFÎ² co-receptor endoglin, and reduced levels of mature VEGF-C protein. Our data suggest that Pik3r1 isoforms are required for distinct steps of embryonic lymphangiogenesis in different organ microenvironments, whereas they are largely dispensable for hemangiogenesis.

The prototypical subunit-regulated Nox, Nox2, is the membrane-associated catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase. Nox2 forms a heterodimer with the integral membrane protein, p22phox, and this heterodimer binds to the regulatory subunits p47phox, p67phox, p40phox and the small GTPase Rac, triggering superoxide generation. Nox-organizer protein 1 (NOXO1) and Nox-activator 1 (NOXA1), respective homologs of p47phox and p67phox, together with p22phox and Rac, activate Nox1, a non-phagocytic homolog of Nox2. NOXO1 and p22phox also regulate Nox3, whereas Nox4 requires only p22phox. In this study, we have assembled and analyzed amino acid sequences of Nox regulatory subunit orthologs from vertebrates, a urochordate, an echinoderm, a mollusc, a cnidarian, a choanoflagellate, fungi and a slime mold amoeba to investigate the evolutionary history of these subunits. Results Ancestral p47phox, p67phox, and p22phox genes are broadly seen in the metazoa, except for the ecdysozoans. The choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the unicellular organism that is the closest relatives of multicellular animals, encodes early prototypes of p22phox, p47phox as well as the earliest known Nox2-like ancestor of the Nox1-3 subfamily. p67phox- and p47phox-like genes are seen in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the limpet Lottia gigantea that also possess Nox2-like co-orthologs of vertebrate Nox1-3. Duplication of primordial p47phox and p67phox genes occurred in vertebrates, with the duplicated branches evolving into NOXO1 and NOXA1. Analysis of characteristic domains of regulatory subunits suggests a novel view of the evolution of Nox: in fish, p40phox participated in regulating both Nox1 and Nox2, but after the appearance of mammals, Nox1\n\nA Cross-Species Study of PI3K Protein-Protein Interactions Reveals the Direct Interaction of P85 and SHP2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBreitkopf, Susanne B.; Yang, Xuemei; Begley, Michael J.; Kulkarni, Meghana; Chiu, Yu-Hsin; Turke, Alexa B.; Lauriol, Jessica; Yuan, Min; Qi, Jie; Engelman, Jeffrey A.; Hong, Pengyu; Kontaridis, Maria I.; Cantley, Lewis C.; Perrimon, Norbert; Asara, John M.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nUsing a series of immunoprecipitation (IP) - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments and reciprocal BLAST, we conducted a fly-human cross-species comparison of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) interactome in a drosophila S2R+ cell line and several NSCLC and human multiple myeloma cell lines to identify conserved interacting proteins to PI3K, a critical signaling regulator of the AKT pathway. Using H929 human cancer cells and drosophila S2R+ cells, our data revealed an unexpected direct binding of Corkscrew, the drosophila ortholog of the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase type II (SHP2) to the Pi3k21B (p60) regulatory subunit of PI3K (p50/p85 human ortholog) but no association with Pi3k92e, the human ortholog of the p110 catalytic subunit. The p85-SHP2 association was validated in human cell lines, and formed a ternary regulatory complex with GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (GAB2). Validation experiments with knockdown of GAB2 and Far-Western blots proved the direct interaction of SHP2 with p85, independent of adaptor proteins and transfected FLAG-p85 provided evidence that SHP2 binding on p85 occurred on the SH2 domains. A disruption of the SHP2-p85 complex took place after insulin/IGF1 stimulation or imatinib treatment, suggesting that the direct SHP2-p85 interaction was both independent of AKT activation and positively regulates the ERK signaling pathway.\n\nBinding of influenza A virus NS1 protein to the inter-SH2 domain of p85 suggests a novel mechanism for phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHale, Benjamin G; Batty, Ian H; Downes, C Peter; Randall, Richard E\n\n2008-01-18\n\nInfluenza A virus NS1 protein stimulates host-cell phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling by binding to the p85beta regulatory subunit of PI3K. Here, in an attempt to establish a mechanism for this activation, we report further on the functional interaction between NS1 and p85beta. Complex formation was found to be independent of NS1 RNA binding activity and is mediated by the C-terminal effector domain of NS1. Intriguingly, the primary direct binding site for NS1 on p85beta is the inter-SH2 domain, a coiled-coil structure that acts as a scaffold for the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. In vitro kinase activity assays, together with protein binding competition studies, reveal that NS1 does not displace p110 from the inter-SH2 domain, and indicate that NS1 can form an active heterotrimeric complex with PI3K. In addition, it was established that residues at the C terminus of the inter-SH2 domain are essential for mediating the interaction between p85beta and NS1. Equivalent residues in p85alpha have previously been implicated in the basal inhibition of p110. However, such p85alpha residues were unable to substitute for those in p85beta with regards NS1 binding. Overall, these data suggest a model by which NS1 activates PI3K catalytic activity by masking a normal regulatory element specific to the p85beta inter-SH2 domain.\n\nTruncated ALK derived from chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) binds to the SH3 domain of p85-PI3K.\n\nPubMed\n\nPolgar, Doris; Leisser, Christina; Maier, Susanne; Strasser, Stephan; RÃ¼ger, Beate; Dettke, Markus; Khorchide, Maya; Simonitsch, Ingrid; Cerni, Christa; Krupitza, Georg\n\n2005-02-15\n\nThe chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) is associated with \"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas\" (ALCL), a Non Hodgkin Lymphoma occurring in childhood. The fusion of the tyrosine kinase gene-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) on chromosome 2p23 to the NPM (nucleophosmin/B23) gene on chromosome 5q35 results in a 80 kDa chimeric protein, which activates the \"survival\" kinase PI3K. However, the binding mechanism between truncated ALK and PI3K is poorly understood. Therefore, we attempted to elucidate the molecular interaction between ALK and the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K. Here we provide evidence that the truncated ALK homodimer binds to the SH3 domain of p85. This finding may be useful for the development of a new target-specific intervention.\n\nThe B55Î± Regulatory Subunit of Protein Phosphatase 2A Mediates Fibroblast Growth Factor-Induced p107 Dephosphorylation and Growth Arrest in Chondrocytes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDaempfling, Lea\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced growth arrest of chondrocytes is a unique cell type-specific response which contrasts with the proliferative response of most cell types and underlies several genetic skeletal disorders caused by activating FGF receptor (FGFR) mutations. We have shown that one of the earliest key events in FGF-induced growth arrest is dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) family member p107 by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a ubiquitously expressed multisubunit phosphatase. In this report, we show that the PP2A-B55Î± holoenzyme (PP2A containing the B55Î± subunit) is responsible for this phenomenon. Only the B55Î± (55-kDa regulatory subunit, alpha isoform) regulatory subunit of PP2A was able to bind p107, and this interaction was induced by FGF in chondrocytes but not in other cell types. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of B55Î± prevented p107 dephosphorylation and FGF-induced growth arrest of RCS (rat chondrosarcoma) chondrocytes. Importantly, the B55Î± subunit bound with higher affinity to dephosphorylated p107. Since the p107 region interacting with B55Î± is also the site of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) binding, B55Î± association may also prevent p107 phosphorylation by CDKs. FGF treatment induces dephosphorylation of the B55Î± subunit itself on several serine residues that drastically increases the affinity of B55Î± for the PP2A A/C dimer and p107. Together these observations suggest a novel mechanism of p107 dephosphorylation mediated by activation of PP2A through B55Î± dephosphorylation. This mechanism might be a general signal transduction pathway used by PP2A to initiate cell cycle arrest when required by external signals.

We employed epitope-tagged catalytic subunit to correlate subcellular localization and gene-inducing activity in the presence of regulatory subunit or protein kinase inhibitor (PKI). Transiently expressed catalytic subunit distributed throughout the cell and induced gene expression. Co-expression of regulatory subunit or PKI blocked gene induction and prevented nuclear accumulation. A mutant PKI lacking the nuclear export signal blocked gene induction but not nuclear accumulation, demonstrating that nuclear export is not essential to inhibit gene induction. When the catalytic subunit was targeted to the nucleus with a nuclear localization signal, it was not sequestered in the cytoplasm by regulatory subunit, although its activity was completely inhibited. PKI redistributed the nuclear catalytic subunit to the cytoplasm and blocked gene induction, demonstrating that the nuclear export signal of PKI can override a strong nuclear localization signal. With increasing PKI, the export process appeared to saturate, resulting in the return of catalytic subunit to the nucleus. These results demonstrate that both the regulatory subunit and PKI are able to completely inhibit the gene-inducing activity of the catalytic subunit even when the catalytic subunit is forced to concentrate in the nuclear compartment.\n\nThe nematode homologue of Mediator complex subunit 28, F28F8.5, is a critical regulator of C. elegans development.\n\nPubMed\n\nKostrouchovÃ¡, MarkÃ©ta; Kostrouch, David; Chughtai, Ahmed A; KaÅ¡Å¡Ã¡k, Filip; NovotnÃ½, Jan P; KostrouchovÃ¡, Veronika; Benda, AleÅ¡; Krause, Michael W; Saudek, VladimÃ­r; KostrouchovÃ¡, Marta; Kostrouch, ZdenÄk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe evolutionarily conserved Mediator complex is a critical player in regulating transcription. Comprised of approximately two dozen proteins, the Mediator integrates diverse regulatory signals through direct protein-protein interactions that, in turn, modulate the influence of Mediator on RNA Polymerase II activity. One Mediator subunit, MED28, is known to interact with cytoplasmic structural proteins, providing a potential direct link between cytoplasmic dynamics and the control of gene transcription. Although identified in many animals and plants, MED28 is not present in yeast; no bona fide MED28 has been described previously in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we identify bioinformatically F28F8.5, an uncharacterized predicted protein, as the nematode homologue of MED28. As in other Metazoa, F28F8.5 has dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization and plays critical roles in the regulation of development. F28F8.5 is a vital gene and its null mutants have severely malformed gonads and do not reproduce. F28F8.5 interacts on the protein level with the Mediator subunits MDT-6 and MDT-30. Our results indicate that F28F8.5 is an orthologue of MED28 and suggest that the potential to link cytoplasmic and nuclear events is conserved between MED28 vertebrate and nematode orthologues.\n\nRole of the p55-gamma subunit of PI3K in ALK-induced cell migration: RNAi-based selection of cell migration regulators.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeo, Minchul; Kim, Jong-Heon; Suk, Kyoungho\n\n2017-05-04\n\nRecently, unbiased functional genetic selection identified novel cell migration-regulating genes. This RNAi-based functional selection was performed using 63,996 pooled lentiviral shRNAs targeting 21,332 mouse genes. After five rounds of selection using cells with accelerated or impaired migration, shRNAs were retrieved and identified by half-hairpin barcode sequencing using cells with the selected phenotypes. This selection process led to the identification of 29 novel cell migration regulators. One of these candidates, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), was further investigated. Subsequent studies revealed that ALK promoted cell migration through the PI3K-AKT pathway via the p55Î³ regulatory subunit of PI3K, rather than more commonly used p85 subunit. Western blot and immunohistochemistry studies using mouse brain tissues revealed similar temporal expression patterns of ALK, phospho-p55Î³, and phospho-AKT during different stages of development. These data support an important role for the p55Î³ subunit of PI3K in ALK-induced cell migration during brain development.\n\nThe nematode homologue of Mediator complex subunit 28, F28F8.5, is a critical regulator of C. elegans development\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKostrouchovÃ¡, MarkÃ©ta; Kostrouch, David; KaÅ¡Å¡Ã¡k, Filip; KostrouchovÃ¡, Veronika; Benda, AleÅ¡; Krause, Michael W.; Saudek, VladimÃ­r; KostrouchovÃ¡, Marta\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe evolutionarily conserved Mediator complex is a critical player in regulating transcription.

Significant spectral changes, indicative of a conformational change, were observed on formation of a complex with a 17 residue peptide containing a phosphorylated tyrosine residue. The sequence of this peptide is identical to the sequence surrounding Tyr751 in the kinase-insert region of the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor (beta PDGFR). The rotational correlation times measured by fluorescence anisotropy decay indicated that phosphopeptide binding changed the shape of the SH2 domain-containing fragment. The CD and fluorescence spectroscopy data support the secondary structure prediction based on sequence analysis and provide evidence for flexible linker regions between the various domains of the p85 proteins.

P85Î±, AP-1, and PDCD4 expressions were detected in PTC tissues (nâ=â116) and thyroid papillary hyperplasia (PTH) tissues (nâ=â90) by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Associations of P85Î±, AP-1, and PDCD4 expressions with clinicopathological features in PTC were analyzed. Diagnostic values of P85Î±, AP-1, and PDCD4 in PTC were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. P85Î±, AP-1, and PDCD4 expression levels in PTC tissues were statistically different from those in PTH tissues (all Pâ<â0.05). In PTC tissues, AP-1 expression was positively associated with P85Î± expression (râ=â0.841, Pâ<â0.01), while negatively associated with PDCD4 expression (râ=â-0.755, Pâ<â0.01). P85Î± expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and the degree of differentiation (both Pâ<â0.05); AP-1 and PDCD4 expressions were associated with the degree of differentiation (both Pâ<â0.05). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of P85Î± were 92.2 and 91.1Â %, respectively, with a cutoff value of 2.100 and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.966. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of AP-1 reached 94.4 and 93.3Â % with a cutoff value of 1.655 and an AUC of 0.987. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of PDCD4 were 54.4 and 85.6Â % with a cutoff value of 2.025 and an AUC of 0.754. P85Î±, AP-1, and PDCD4 proteins may be related to the tumorigenesis and progression of PTC. Moreover, P85Î±, AP-1, and PDCD4 proteins may serve as potential diagnostic markers to the biological behavior of PTC.\n\nSubunit arrangement in P2X receptors.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Lin-Hua; Kim, Miran; Spelta, Valeria; Bo, Xuenong; Surprenant, Annmarie; North, R Alan\n\n2003-10-01\n\nATP-gated ionotropic receptors (P2X receptors) are distributed widely in the nervous system. For example, a hetero-oligomeric receptor containing both P2X2 and P2X3 subunits is involved in primary afferent sensation. Each subunit has two membrane-spanning domains. We have used disulfide bond formation between engineered cysteines to demonstrate close proximity between the outer ends of the first transmembrane domain of one subunit and the second transmembrane domain of another. After expression in HEK 293 cells of such modified P2X2 or P2X4 subunits, the disulfide bond formation is evident because an ATP-evoked channel opening requires previous reduction with dithiothreitol. In the hetero-oligomeric P2X2/3 receptor the coexpression of doubly substituted subunits with wild-type partners allows us to deduce that the hetero-oligomeric channel contains adjacent P2X3 subunits but does not contain adjacent P2X2 subunits. The results suggest a \"head-to-tail\" subunit arrangement in the quaternary structure of P2X receptors and show that a trimeric P2X2/3 receptor would have the composition P2X2(P2X3)2.\n\nInfectious bursal disease virus activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway by interaction of VP5 protein with the p85{alpha} subunit of PI3K\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWei Li; Hou Lei; Zhu Shanshan\n\nPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling is commonly activated upon virus infection and has been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular functions such as proliferation and apoptosis. The present study demonstrated for the first time that infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), the causative agent of a highly contagious disease in chickens, can induce Akt phosphorylation in cultured cells, by a mechanism that is dependent on PI3K. Inhibition of PI3K activation greatly enhanced virus-induced cytopathic effect and apoptotic cell death as evidenced by cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase and activation of caspase-3. Investigations into the mechanism of PI3K/Akt activation revealed that IBDVmoreÂ Â» activates PI3K/Akt signaling through binding of the non-structural protein VP5 to regulatory subunit p85{alpha} of PI3K resulting in the suppression of premature apoptosis and improved virus growth after infection. The results presented here provide a basis for understanding molecular mechanism of IBDV infection.Â«Â less\n\nDifferential regulation of the androgen receptor by protein phosphatase regulatory subunits\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGrey, James; Jones, Dominic; Wilson, Laura; Nakjang, Sirintra; Clayton, Jake; Temperley, Richard; Clark, Emma; Gaughan, Luke; Robson, Craig\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Androgen Receptor (AR) is a key molecule in the development, maintenance and progression of prostate cancer (PC). However, the relationship between the AR and co-regulatory proteins that facilitate AR activity in castrate resistant settings remain understudied. Here we show that protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunits, identified from a phosphatase RNAi screen, direct PP1 catalytic subunits to a varied yet significant response in AR function. As such, we have characterised the PP1Î² holoenzyme, myosin phosphatase (MLCP), as a novel ligand independent regulator of the AR. Sustained MLCP activity through down-regulation of the MLCP inhibitory subunit, PPP1R14C, results in impaired AR nuclear translocation, protein stability and transcriptional activity in distinct models of PC progression, culminating in restoration of a non-malignant prostate genotype. Phenotypically, a marked reduction in cell proliferation and migration, characterised by G1 cell cycle arrest is observed, confirming PP1 holoenzyme disruption as a novel treatment approach in PC.

To maximize cytokine production from plasmid DNA, molecular steps controlling IL-12p70 biosynthesis at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels were investigated. We show that the combination of RNA/codon-optimized gene sequences and fine-tuning of the relative expression levels of the two subunits within a cell resulted in increased production of the IL-12p70 heterodimer. We found that the p40 subunit plays a critical role in enhancing the stability, intracellular trafficking, and export of the p35 subunit. This posttranslational regulation mediated by the p40 subunit is conserved in mammals. Based on these findings, dual gene expression vectors were generated, producing an optimal ratio of the two subunits, resulting in a â¼1 log increase in human, rhesus, and murine IL-12p70 production compared with vectors expressing the wild type sequences. Such optimized DNA plasmids also produced significantly higher levels of systemic bioactive IL-12 upon in vivo DNA delivery in mice compared with plasmids expressing the wild type sequences. A single therapeutic injection of an optimized murine IL-12 DNA plasmid showed significantly more potent control of tumor development in the B16 melanoma cancer model in mice. Therefore, the improved IL-12p70 DNA vectors have promising potential for in vivo use as molecular vaccine adjuvants and in cancer immunotherapy.

AKAPs tether PKA to defined cellular compartments establishing distinct pools to increase the specificity of PKA signalling. Here, we elucidated the structure of an extended PKA-binding domain of AKAP18Î² bound to the D/D domain of the regulatory RIIÎ± subunits of PKA. We identified three hydrophilic anchor points in AKAP18Î² outside the core PKA-binding domain, which mediate contacts with the D/D domain. Such anchor points are conserved within AKAPs that bind regulatory RII subunits of PKA. We derived a different set of anchor points in AKAPs binding regulatory RI subunits of PKA. In vitro and cell-based experiments confirm the relevance of these sites for the interaction of RII subunits with AKAP18 and of RI subunits with the RI-specific smAKAP. Thus we report a novel mechanism governing interactions of AKAPs with PKA. The sequence specificity of each AKAP around the anchor points and the requirement of these points for the tight binding of PKA allow the development of selective inhibitors to unequivocally ascribe cellular functions to the AKAP18-PKA and other AKAP-PKA interactions.

The enzyme exhibits full activity only when the regulatory subunit (RSU) binds to the catalytic subunit (CSU). However, the crystal structure of the holoenzyme has not been reported yet, and the molecular interaction between the CSU and RSU is also unknown. Herein, we introduced a global-surface, site-directed labeling scanning method to determine the potential interaction region of the RSU. This approach relies on the insertion of a bulky fluorescent probe at the designated site on the surface of the RSU to cause a dramatic change in holoenzyme activity by perturbing subunit interaction. Then, the key amino acid residues in the potential interaction regions were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Compared to the wild-type, the single-point mutants R26A and D69A showed 54 and 64â% activity, respectively, whereas the double mutant (R26A+D69A) gave 14â%, thus suggesting that residues Arg26 and Asp69 are the key residues of subunit interaction with cooperative action. Additionally, the results of GST pull-down assays and pH-dependence experiments suggested that polar interaction is the main force for subunits interaction. A plausible protein-protein interaction model of the holoenzyme of Escherichia coli AHAS III is proposed, based on the mutagenesis and protein docking studies. The protocol established here should be useful for the identification of the molecular interactions between proteins. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Generally more than one of the seven known P2X subunits have been identified in a given cell type. Six of the seven cloned P2X subunits can efficiently form functional homotrimeric ion channels in recombinant expression systems. This is in contrast to other ligand-gated ion channel families, such as the Cys-loop or glutamate receptors, where homomeric assemblies seem to represent the exception rather than the rule. P2XR mediated responses recorded from native tissues rarely match exactly the biophysical and pharmacological properties of heterologously expressed homomeric P2XRs. Heterotrimerization of P2X subunits is likely to account for this observed diversity. While the existence of heterotrimeric P2X2/3Rs and their role in physiological processes is well established, the composition of most other P2XR heteromers and/or the interplay between distinct trimeric receptor complexes in native tissues is not clear. After a description of P2XR assembly and the structure of the intersubunit ATP-binding site, this review summarizes the distribution of P2XR subunits in selected mammalian cell types and the biochemically and/or functionally characterized heteromeric P2XRs that have been observed upon heterologous co-expression of P2XR subunits. We further provide examples where the postulated heteromeric P2XRs have been suggested to occur in native tissues and an overview of the currently available pharmacological tools that have been used to discriminate between homo- and heteromeric P2XRs.

Here, we describe the structural states of the p85Î± dimer, based on data from in vivo and in vitro solution characterization. Our in vitro assembly and structural analyses have been enabled by the creation of cysteine-free p85Î± that is functionally equivalent to native p85Î±. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies showed that p85Î± undergoes rapidly reversible monomer-dimer assembly that is highly exothermic in nature. In addition to the documented SH3-PR1 dimerization interaction, we identified a second intermolecular interaction mediated by cSH2 domains at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide. We have demonstrated in vivo concentration-dependent dimerization of p85Î± using fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. Finally, we have defined solution conditions under which the protein is predominantly monomeric or dimeric, providing the basis for small angle x-ray scattering and chemical cross-linking structural analysis of the discrete dimer. These experimental data have been used for the integrative structure determination of the p85Î± dimer. Our study provides new insight into the structure and assembly of the p85Î± homodimer and suggests that this protein is a highly dynamic molecule whose conformational flexibility allows it to transiently associate with multiple binding proteins.

Responding quickly to changing energy demands, AMPK works to restore levels of ATP during times of cellular stress by promoting ATP producing catabolic pathways and inhibiting ATP consuming anabolic ones. As a heterotrimeric protein complex, AMPK's subunits each act in unique and crucial ways to control AMPK function and its localization within the cell. Research in the last decade has identified and begun to characterize the impact of naturally occurring mutations in the gamma regulatory subunits. Mutations in the Î³2 subunit have implications for cardiac function and disease, while the R225W mutation in the Î³3 subunit have implications for skeletal muscle fuel metabolism and resistance to fatigue. Research focused on structure-function aspects of AMPK regulatory subunits will lead to a better understanding of the roles of AMPK in health and disease.\n\nMicroinjection of the SH2 domain of the 85-kilodalton subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibits insulin-induced DNA synthesis and c-fos expression.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJhun, B H; Rose, D W; Seely, B L; Rameh, L; Cantley, L; Saltiel, A R; Olefsky, J M\n\n1994-01-01\n\nWe have investigated the functional role of the SH2 domain of the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the insulin signal transduction pathway. Microinjection of a bacterial fusion protein containing the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 inhibited insulin- and other growth factor-induced DNA synthesis by 90% and c-fos protein expression by 80% in insulin-responsive rat fibroblasts. The specificity of the fusion protein was examined by in vitro precipitation experiments, which showed that the SH2 domain of p85 can independently associate with both insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor itself in the absence of detectable binding to other phosphoproteins. The microinjection results were confirmed through the use of an affinity-purified antibody directed against p85, which gave the same phenotype. Additional studies were carried out in another cell line expressing mutant insulin receptors which lack the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues with which p85 interacts. Microinjection of the SH2 domain fusion protein also inhibited insulin signaling in these cells, suggesting that association of p85 with insulin receptor substrate 1 is a key element in insulin-mediated cell cycle progression. In addition, coinjection of purified p21ras protein with the p85 fusion protein or the antibody restored DNA synthesis, suggesting that ras function is either downstream or independent of p85 SH2 domain interaction.

I.; Popova, I.; Grindeland, R. E.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nPhotoaffinity labeling in heart tissue of rats flown on Cosmos 2044 was used to measure the regulatory (R) subunits of adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. A significant decrease of RII subunits in the particulate cell fraction extract (S2; P less than 0.05 in all cases) was observed when extracts of tissue samples from vivarium controls were compared with those from flight animals. Photoaffinity labeling of the soluble fraction (S1) was observed to be unaffected by spaceflight or any of the simulation conditions. Proteins of the S2 fraction constitute a minor (less than 10 percent) component of the total, whereas the S1 fraction contained most of the cell proteins. Changes in a relatively minor aspect of adenosine monophosphate-mediated reactions are considered to be representative of a metabolic effect.\n\nNADP+ Binding to the Regulatory Subunit of Methionine Adenosyltransferase II Increases Intersubunit Binding Affinity in the Hetero-Trimer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOrtega, Rebeca; MartÃ­nez-JÃºlvez, Marta; Revilla-Guarinos, Ainhoa; PÃ©rez-Pertejo, Yolanda; VelÃ¡zquez-Campoy, AdriÃ¡n; Sanz-Aparicio, Julia; Pajares, MarÃ­a A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMammalian methionine adenosyltransferase II (MAT II) is the only hetero-oligomer in this family of enzymes that synthesize S-adenosylmethionine using methionine and ATP as substrates. Binding of regulatory Î² subunits and catalytic Î±2 dimers is known to increase the affinity for methionine, although scarce additional information about this interaction is available. This work reports the use of recombinant Î±2 and Î² subunits to produce oligomers showing kinetic parameters comparable to MAT II purified from several tissues. According to isothermal titration calorimetry data and densitometric scanning of the stained hetero-oligomer bands on denatured gels, the composition of these oligomers is that of a hetero-trimer with Î±2 dimers associated to single Î² subunits. Additionally, the regulatory subunit is able to bind NADP+ with a 1â¶1 stoichiometry, the cofactor enhancing Î² to Î±2-dimer binding affinity. Mutants lacking residues involved in NADP+ binding and N-terminal truncations of the Î² subunit were able to oligomerize with Î±2-dimers, although the kinetic properties appeared altered. These data together suggest a role for both parts of the sequence in the regulatory role exerted by the Î² subunit on catalysis. Moreover, preparation of a structural model for the hetero-oligomer, using the available crystal data, allowed prediction of the regions involved in Î² to Î±2-dimer interaction. Finally, the implications that the presence of different N-terminals in the Î² subunit could have on MAT II behavior are discussed in light of the recent identification of several splicing forms of this subunit in hepatoma cells.

The multi-subunit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme plays an important, yet poorly characterized role in dephosphorylating proteins during mitosis. PP2As are heterotrimeric complexes comprising a catalytic, structural, and regulatory subunit. Regulatory subunits are mutually exclusive and determine subcellular localization and substrate specificity of PP2A. At least 3 different classes of regulatory subunits exist (termed B, Bâ², Bâ³) but there is no obvious similarity in primary sequence between these classes. Therefore, it is not known how these diverse regulatory subunits interact with the same holoenzyme to facilitate specific PP2A functions in vivo. The Bâ³ family of regulatory subunits is the least understood because these proteins lack conserved structural domains. RSA-1 (regulator of spindle assembly) is a regulatory Bâ³ subunit required for mitotic spindle assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans. In order to address how Bâ³ subunits interact with the PP2A core enzyme, we focused on a conditional allele, rsa-1(or598ts), and determined that this mutation specifically disrupts the protein interaction between RSA-1 and the PP2A structural subunit, PAA-1. Through genetic screening, we identified a putative interface on the PAA-1 structural subunit that interacts with a defined region of RSA-1/Bâ³. In the context of previously published results, these data propose a mechanism of how different PP2A B-regulatory subunit families can bind the same holoenzyme in a mutually exclusive manner, to perform specific tasks in vivo.

F., Gibbs, J. B. & Tatchell, K. (1986) Genetics 113, 247-264] by selection of ras2::LEU2 revertants that grew on non-fermentable carbon sources. The revertants were placed into groups of increasing severity based on the number of PKA-dependent traits affected [Cannon, J. F., Gitan, R. & Tatchell, K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11897-11904]. In this work the ras2 mutation has been crossed out in each bcy1 allele and the phenotypes of these mutants have been assessed. The order of severity of the mutants in both genetic backgrounds is maintained but the severity of each mutant in the normal background is higher than in the ras2::LEU2 background. Total catalytic-subunit and regulatory-subunit activities were measured in crude extracts of the bcy1 ras2::LEU2 mutants. With one exception (bcy1-6) the calculated regulatory subunit/catalytic subunit ratios of the bcy1 mutants relative to that of wild-type cells were greater than one. The dependence of PKA activity on cAMP was measured in permeabilized cells. The strains show an activity ratio in the absence and presence of cAMP in the range 0.5-1 for Kemptide phosphorylation. Overexpression of the high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase gene (PDE2) in the bcy1 ras2::LEU2 strains did not alter their PKA-dependent phenotypes. However, transformants were not observed from the parental ras2::LEU2 strain and the bcy1-6 ras2::LEU2 strain. The results are discussed with respect to a hypothesis for the molecular mechanism of the differential reversal of ras2 phenotypes by the bcy1 alleles. Mutations in the regulatory subunit are predicted to affect the structure of the holoenzyme such that the catalytic subunit is capable of maintaining an active catalytic state, without the need to dissociate from the regulatory subunit.\n\nIRS-1 activates phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase by associating with src homology 2 domains of p85.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMyers, M G; Backer, J M; Sun, X J; Shoelson, S; Hu, P; Schlessinger, J; Yoakim, M; Schaffhausen, B; White, M F\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIRS-1 is an insulin receptor substrate that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3'-kinase immediately after insulin stimulation. Recombinant IRS-1 protein was tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor in vitro and associated with the PtdIns 3'-kinase from lysates of quiescent 3T3 fibroblasts. Bacterial fusion proteins containing the src homology 2 domains (SH2 domains) of the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of the PtdIns 3'-kinase bound quantitatively to tyrosine phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, IRS-1, and this association was blocked by phosphotyrosine-containing synthetic peptides. Moreover, the phosphorylated peptides and the SH2 domains each inhibited binding of PtdIns 3'-kinase to IRS-1. Phosphorylated IRS-1 activated PtdIns 3'-kinase in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates in vitro, and this activation was blocked by SH2 domain fusion proteins. These data suggest that the interaction between PtdIns 3'-kinase and IRS-1 is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylated motifs on IRS-1 and the SH2 domains of p85, and IRS-1 activates PtdIns 3'-kinase by binding to the SH2 domains of p85. Thus, IRS-1 likely serves to transmit the insulin signal by binding and regulating intracellular enzymes containing SH2 domains.

However, neither the nuclear export signals (NESs) for the ribosomal subunits nor the receptor proteins, which recognize the NESs and mediate export of the subunits, have been identified. We showed previously that Nmd3p is an essential protein from yeast that is required for a late step in biogenesis of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit. Here, we show that Nmd3p shuttles and that deletion of the NES from Nmd3p leads to nuclear accumulation of the mutant protein, inhibition of the 60S subunit biogenesis, and inhibition of the nuclear export of 60S subunits. Moreover, the 60S subunits that accumulate in the nucleus can be coimmunoprecipitated with the NES-deficient Nmd3p. 60S subunit biogenesis and export of truncated Nmd3p were restored by the addition of an exogenous NES. To identify the export receptor for Nmd3p we show that Nmd3p shuttling and 60S export is blocked by the Crm1p-specific inhibitor leptomycin B. These results identify Crm1p as the receptor for Nmd3p export. Thus, export of the 60S subunit is mediated by the adapter protein Nmd3p in a Crm1p-dependent pathway.

The uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca(2+)-activated Ca(2+) channel, with the Ca(2+) pore formed by the MCU protein and Ca(2+)-dependent activation mediated by MICU subunits. Recently, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein EMRE was identified as a uniporter subunit absolutely required for Ca(2+) permeation. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory purpose of EMRE remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine the transmembrane orientation of EMRE, and show that its known MCU-activating function is mediated by the interaction of transmembrane helices from both proteins. We also reveal a second function of EMRE: to maintain tight MICU regulation of the MCU pore, a role that requires EMRE to bind MICU1 using its conserved C-terminal polyaspartate tail. This dual functionality of EMRE ensures that all transport-competent uniporters are tightly regulated, responding appropriately to a dynamic intracellular Ca(2+) landscape.\n\nSubunit interactions in horse spleen apoferritin. Dissociation by extremes of pH\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCrichton, Robert R.; Bryce, Charles F. A.\n\n1973-01-01\n\n1. The dissociation of horse spleen apoferritin as a function of pH was analysed by sedimentation-velocity techniques. The oligomer is stable in the range pH2.8â10.6. Between pH2.8 and 1.6 and 10.6 and 13.0 both oligomer and subunits can be detected. At pH values between 1.6 and 1.0 the subunit is the only species observed, although below pH1.0 aggregation of the subunits to a particle sedimenting much faster than the oligomer occurs. 2. When apoferritin is first dissociated into subunits at low pH values and then dialysed into buffers of pH1.5â5.0, the subunit reassociates to oligomer in the pH range 3.1â4.3. 3. U.v.-difference spectroscopy was used to study conformational changes occurring during the dissociation process. The difference spectrum in acid can be accounted for by the transfer of four to five tyrosine residues/subunit from the interior of the protein into the solvent. This process is reversed on reassociation, but shows the same hysteresis as found by sedimentation techniques. The difference spectrum in alkali is more complex, but is consistent with the deprotonation of tyrosine residues, which appear to have rather high pK values. 4. In addition to the involvement of tyrosine residues in the conformational change at low pH values, spectral evidence is presented that one tryptophan residue/subunit also changes its environment before dissociation and subsequent to reassociation. 5. Analysis of the dissociation and reassociation of apoferritin at low pH values suggests that this is a co-operative process involving protonation and deprotonation of at least two carboxyl functions of rather low intrinsic pK. The dissociation at alkaline pH values does not appear to be co-operative. 6. Of the five tyrosine residues/subunit only one can be nitrated with tetranitromethane. Guanidination of lysine residues results in the modification of seven out of a total of nine residues/subunit. Nine out of the ten arginine residues/subunit react with\n\nCloning and characterization of two novel zebrafish P2X receptor subunits.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiaz-Hernandez, Miguel; Cox, Jane A; Migita, Keisuke; Haines, William; Egan, Terrance M; Voigt, Mark M\n\n2002-07-26\n\nIn this report we describe the cloning and characterization of two P2X receptor subunits cloned from the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Primary sequence analysis suggests that one cDNA encodes an ortholog of the mammalian P2X(4) subunit and the second cDNA encodes the ortholog of the mammalian P2X(5) subunit. The zP2X(4) subunit forms a homo-oligomeric receptor that displays a low affinity for ATP (EC(50)=274+/-48 microM) and very low affinity (EC(50)>500 microM) for other purinergic ligands such as alphabetameATP, suramin, and PPADS. As seen with the mammalian orthologs, the zP2X(5) subunit forms a homo-oligomeric receptor that yields very small whole-cell currents (<20pA), making determination of an EC(50) problematic. Both subunit genes were physically mapped onto the zebrafish genome using radiation hybrid analysis of the T51 panel, with the zp2x4 localized to LG21 and zp2x5 to LG5.\n\nProtein synthesis during acquisition of long-term facilitation is needed for the persistent loss of regulatory subunits of the Aplysia cAMP-dependent protein kinase.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBergold, P J; Sweatt, J D; Winicov, I; Weiss, K R; Kandel, E R; Schwartz, J H\n\n1990-01-01\n\nDepending on the number or the length of exposure, application of serotonin can produce either short-term or long-term presynaptic facilitation of Aplysia sensory-to-motor synapses. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a heterodimer of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits, has been shown to become stably activated only during long-term facilitation. Both acquisition of long-term facilitation and persistent activation of the kinase is blocked by anisomycin, an effective, reversible, and specific inhibitor of protein synthesis in Aplysia. We report here that 2-hr exposure of pleural sensory cells to serotonin lowers the concentration of regulatory subunits but does not change the concentration of catalytic subunits, as assayed 24 hr later; 5-min exposure to serotonin has no effect on either type of subunit. Increasing intracellular cAMP with a permeable analog of cAMP together with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl methylxanthine also decreased regulatory subunits, suggesting that cAMP is the second messenger mediating serotonin action. Anisomycin blocked the loss of regulatory subunits only when applied with serotonin; application after the 2-hr treatment with serotonin had no effect. In the Aplysia accessory radula contractor muscle, prolonged exposure to serotonin or to the peptide transmitter small cardioactive peptide B, both of which produce large increases in intracellular cAMP, does not decrease regulatory subunits. This mechanism of regulating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase therefore may be specific to the nervous system. We conclude that during long-term facilitation, new protein is synthesized in response to the facilitatory stimulus, which changes the ratio of subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This alteration in ratio could persistently activate the kinase and produce the persistent phosphorylation seen in long-term facilitated sensory cells.

Crosstalk between CaM and PI3KÎ± has been an area of intensive research. Recent experiments have shown that in adenocarcinoma, K-Ras4B is involved in the CaM-PI3KÎ± crosstalk. Based on experimental results, we have recently put forward a hypothesis that the coordination of CaM and PI3KÎ± with K-Ras4B forms a CaM-PI3KÎ±-K-Ras4B ternary complex, which leads to the formation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, the mechanism for the CaM-PI3KÎ± crosstalk is unresolved. Based on molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, here we explored the potential interactions between CaM and the c/nSH2 domains of p85Î± subunit of PI3KÎ±. We demonstrated that CaM can interact with the c/nSH2 domains and the interaction details were unraveled. Moreover, the possible modes for the CaM-cSH2 and CaM-nSH2 interactions were uncovered and we used them to construct a complete CaM-PI3KÎ± complex model. The structural model of CaM-PI3KÎ± interaction not only offers a support for our previous ternary complex hypothesis, but also is useful for drug design targeted at CaM-PI3KÎ± protein-protein interactions.\n\nTwo highly-related regulatory subunits of PP2A exert opposite effects on TGF-Î²/Activin/Nodal signalling\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBatut, Julie; Schmierer, Bernhard; Cao, Jing; Raftery, Laurel A.; Hill, Caroline S.; Howell, Michael\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSummary We identify BÎ± (PPP2R2A) and BÎ´ (PPP2R2D), two highly-related members of the B family of regulatory subunits of the protein phosphatase PP2A, as important modulators of TGF-Î²/Activin/Nodal signalling, which affect the pathway in opposite ways. Knockdown of BÎ± in Xenopus embryos or mammalian tissue culture cells suppresses TGF-Î²/Activin/Nodal-dependent responses, whereas knockdown of BÎ´ enhances these responses. Moreover, in Drosophila, overexpression of Smad2 rescues a severe wing phenotype caused by overexpression of the single Drosophila PP2A B subunit, Twins. We show that in vertebrates BÎ± enhances TGF-Î²/Activin/Nodal signalling by stabilising the basal levels of type I receptor, whereas BÎ´ negatively modulates these pathways by restricting receptor activity. Thus, these highly-related members of the same subfamily of PP2A regulatory subunits differentially regulate TGF-Î²/Activin/Nodal signalling to elicit opposing biological outcomes.

The objective of this work was to study physicochemical and adhesion properties of soy glycinin subunits. Soybean glycinin was extracted from soybean flour and then fractionated into acidic and basic subunits with an estimated purity of 90 and 85%, respectively. Amino acid composition of glycinin subunits was determined. The high hydrophobic amino acid content is a major contributor to the solubility behavior and water resistance of the basic subunits. Acidic subunits and glycinin had similar solubility profiles, showing more than 80% solubility at pH 2.0-4.0 or 6.5-12.0, whereas basic subunits had considerably lower solubility with the minimum at pH 4.5-8.0. Thermal analysis using a differential scanning calorimeter suggested that basic subunits form new oligomeric structures with higher thermal stability than glycinin but no highly ordered structures present in isolated acidic subunits. The wet strength of basic subunits was 160% more than that of acidic subunits prepared at their respective isoelectric points (pI) and cured at 130 degrees C. Both pH and the curing temperature significantly affected adhesive performance. High-adhesion water resistance was usually observed for adhesives from protein prepared at their pI values and cured at elevated temperatures. Basic subunits are responsible for the water resistance of glycinin and are a good starting material for the development of water-resistant adhesives.\n\nMutations in the PP2A regulatory subunit B family genes PPP2R5B, PPP2R5C and PPP2R5D cause human overgrowth.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoveday, Chey; Tatton-Brown, Katrina; Clarke, Matthew; Westwood, Isaac; Renwick, Anthony; Ramsay, Emma; Nemeth, Andrea; Campbell, Jennifer; Joss, Shelagh; Gardner, McKinlay; Zachariou, Anna; Elliott, Anna; Ruark, Elise; van Montfort, Rob; Rahman, Nazneen\n\n2015-09-01\n\nOvergrowth syndromes comprise a group of heterogeneous disorders characterised by excessive growth parameters, often in association with intellectual disability. To identify new causes of human overgrowth, we have been undertaking trio-based exome sequencing studies in overgrowth patients and their unaffected parents. Prioritisation of functionally relevant genes with multiple unique de novo mutations revealed four mutations in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit B family genes protein phosphatase 2, regulatory Subunit B', beta (PPP2R5B); protein phosphatase 2, regulatory Subunit B', gamma (PPP2R5C); and protein phosphatase 2, regulatory Subunit B', delta (PPP2R5D). This observation in 3 related genes in 111 individuals with a similar phenotype is greatly in excess of the expected number, as determined from gene-specific de novo mutation rates (P = 1.43 Ã 10(-10)). Analysis of exome-sequencing data from a follow-up series of overgrowth probands identified a further pathogenic mutation, bringing the total number of affected individuals to 5. Heterozygotes shared similar phenotypic features including increased height, increased head circumference and intellectual disability. The mutations clustered within a region of nine amino acid residues in the aligned protein sequences (P = 1.6 Ã 10(-5)). We mapped the mutations onto the crystal structure of the PP2A holoenzyme complex to predict their molecular and functional consequences. These studies suggest that the mutations may affect substrate binding, thus perturbing the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate particular protein substrates. PP2A is a major negative regulator of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT). Thus, our data further expand the list of genes encoding components of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling cascade that are disrupted in human overgrowth conditions.

Here we show that mouse CD300f (CLM-1) recognizes outer membrane-exposed phosphatidylserine, and regulates the phagocytosis of ACs. CD300f accumulates in phagocytic cups at AC contact sites. Phosphorylation within CD300f cytoplasmic tail tyrosine-based motifs initiates signals that positively or negatively regulate AC phagocytosis. Y276 phosphorylation is necessary for enhanced CD300f-mediated phagocytosis through the recruitment of the p85Î± regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). CD300f-PI3K association leads to activation of downstream Rac/Cdc42 GTPase and mediates changes of F-actin that drive AC engulfment. Importantly, primary macrophages from CD300f-deficient mice have impaired phagocytosis of ACs. The biological consequence of CD300f deficiency is predisposition to autoimmune disease development, as FcÎ³RIIB-deficient mice develop a systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease at a markedly accelerated rate if CD300f is absent. In this report we identify the mechanism and role of CD300f in AC phagocytosis and maintenance of immune homeostasis.\n\nAssociation of the 5â²-upstream regulatory region of the Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene (CHRNA7) with schizophrenia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStephens, Sarah H.; Logel, Judith; Barton, Amanda; Franks, Alexis; Schultz, Jessica; Short, Margaret; Dickenson, Jane; James, Benjamin; Fingerlin, Tasha E.; Wagner, Brandie; Hodgkinson, Colin; Graw, Sharon; Ross, Randal G.; Freedman, Robert; Leonard, Sherry\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground The Î±7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene (CHRNA7) is localized in a chromosomal region (15q14) linked to schizophrenia in multiple independent studies. CHRNA7 was selected as the best candidate gene in the region for a well-documented endophenotype of schizophrenia, the P50 sensory processing deficit, by genetic linkage and biochemical studies. Methods Subjects included Caucasian-Non Hispanic and African-American case-control subjects collected in Denver, and schizophrenic subjects from families in the NIMH Genetics Initiative on Schizophrenia. Thirty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5â²-upstream regulatory region of CHRNA7 were genotyped for association with schizophrenia, and for smoking in schizophrenia. Results The rs3087454 SNP, located at position â1831 bp in the upstream regulatory region of CHRNA7, was significantly associated with schizophrenia in the case-control samples after multiple-testing correction (P = 0.0009, African American; P = 0.013, Caucasian-Non Hispanic); the association was supported in family members. There was nominal association of this SNP with smoking in schizophrenia. Conclusions The data support association of regulatory region polymorphisms in the CHRNA7 gene with schizophrenia.

In this study, we have utilized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the [methyl-{sup 13}C]methionine-labeled enzyme and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate how several of these factors influence the dimerization behavior of the p51 subunit. The {sup 1}H-{sup 13}C HSQC spectrum of p51 obtained at micromolar concentrations indicates that a significant fraction of the p51 adopts a 'p66-like' conformation. SAXS data obtained for p51moreÂ Â» samples were used to determine the fractions of monomer and dimer in the sample and to evaluate the conformation of the fingers/thumb subdomain. All of the p51 monomer observed was found to adopt the compact, 'p51C' conformation observed for the p51 subunit in the RT heterodimer. The NMR and SAXS data indicate that the p51 homodimer adopts a structure that is similar to the p66/p51 heterodimer, with one p51C subunit and a second p51 subunit in an extended, 'p51E' conformation that resembles the p66 subunit of the heterodimer. The fractional dimer concentration and the fingers/thumb orientation are found to depend strongly on the experimental conditions and exhibit a qualitative dependence on nevirapine and ionic strength (KCl) that is similar to the behavior reported for the heterodimer and the p66 homodimer. The L289K mutation interferes with p51 homodimer formation as it does with formation of the heterodimer, despite its location far from the dimer interface. This effect is readily interpreted in terms of a conformational selection model, in which p51{sub L289K} has a much greater preference for the compact, p51C conformation. A reduced level of dimer formation then results from the reduced ratio of the p51E{sub L289K} to p\n\nNeomorphic Mutations in PIK3R1 Confer Sensitivity to MAPK Inhibitors due to Activation of ERK and JNK Pathways | Office of Cancer Genomics\n\nCancer.gov\n\nIn a recent publication in Cancer Cell, CTD2 investigators discovered that a known cancer-associated gain-of-function alteration in phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) results in novel protein activity that confers sensitivity to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors. The PIK3R1 gene encodes the p85Î± regulatory subunit of PIK3. Under normal conditions, p85Î± suppresses PIK3 mediated activation of downstream pathways that promote cell growth and survival.\n\nThe cyanobacterial cytochrome b6f subunit PetP adopts an SH3 fold in solution.\n\nPubMed\n\nVeit, Sebastian; Nagadoi, Aritaka; RÃ¶gner, Matthias; Rexroth, Sascha; Stoll, Raphael; Ikegami, Takahisa\n\n2016-06-01\n\nPetP is a peripheral subunit of the cytochrome b(6)f complex (b(6)f) present in both, cyanobacteria and red algae. It is bound to the cytoplasmic surface of this membrane protein complex where it greatly affects the efficiency of the linear photosynthetic electron flow although it is not directly involved in the electron transfer reactions. Despite the crystal structures of the b(6)f core complex, structural information for the transient regulatory b(6)f subunits is still missing. Here we present the first structure of PetP at atomic resolution as determined by solution NMR. The protein adopts an SH3 fold, which is a common protein motif in eukaryotes but comparatively rare in prokaryotes. The structure of PetP enabled the identification of the potential interaction site for b(6)f binding by conservation mapping. The interaction surface is mainly formed by two large loop regions and one short 310 helix which also exhibit an increased flexibility as indicated by heteronuclear steady-state {(1)H}-(15)N NOE and random coil index parameters. The properties of this potential b(6)f binding site greatly differ from the canonical peptide binding site which is highly conserved in eukaryotic SH3 domains. Interestingly, three other proteins of the photosynthetic electron transport chain share this SH3 fold with PetP: NdhS of the photosynthetic NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH-1), PsaE of the photosystem 1 and subunit Î± of the ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase have, similar to PetP, a great impact on the photosynthetic electron transport. Finally, a model is presented to illustrate how SH3 domains modulate the photosynthetic electron transport processes in cyanobacteria. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Cyclic AMP effects are mainly mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), whose R2B regulatory isoform is the most expressed in mouse adipose tissue, where it protects against diet-induced obesity and fatty liver development. The aim of the study was to investigate possible differences in R2B expression, PKA activity, and lipolysis in adipose tissues from obese and nonobese subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSâThe expression of the different PKA regulatory subunits was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time PCR in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples from 20 nonobese and 67 obese patients. PKA activity and glycerol release were evaluated in total protein extract and adipocytes isolated from fresh tissue samples, respectively. RESULTSâExpression techniques showed that R2B was the most abundant regulatory protein, both at mRNA and protein level. Interestingly, R2B mRNA levels were significantly lower in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues from obese than nonobese patients and negatively correlated with BMI, waist circumference, insulin levels, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Moreover, both basal and stimulated PKA activity and glycerol release were significantly lower in visceral adipose tissue from obese patients then nonobese subjects. CONCLUSIONSâOur results first indicate that, in human adipose tissue, there are important BMI-related differences in R2B expression and PKA activation, which might be included among the multiple determinants involved in the different lipolytic response to Î²-adrenergic activation in obesity.

Recent studies using mice deficient in Nox2 identify this isoform as a novel target against Nox2-implicated inflammatory diseases. Nox2 activation depends on the binding of the proline-rich domain of its heterodimeric partner p22phox to p47phox. A high-throughput screen that monitored this interaction via fluorescence polarization identified ebselen and several of its analogs as inhibitors. Medicinal chemistry was performed to explore structure-activity relationships and to optimize potency. Ebselen and analogs potently inhibited Nox1 and Nox2 activity but were less effective against other isoforms. Ebselen also blocked translocation of p47phox to neutrophil membranes. Thus, ebselen and its analogs represent a class of compounds that inhibit ROS generation by interrupting the assembly of Nox2-activating regulatory subunits. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of a purification strategy for a highly active dimeric b6f complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 enabled characterization of the structural and functional role of the small subunit PetP in this complex. Moreover, the efficient transformability of this strain allowed the generation of a ÎpetP mutant. Analysis on the whole-cell level by growth curves, photosystem II light saturation curves, and P700+ reduction kinetics indicate a strong decrease in the linear electron transport in the mutant strain versus the wild type, while the cyclic electron transport via photosystem I and cytochrome b6f is largely unaffected. This reduction in linear electron transport is accompanied by a strongly decreased stability and activity of the isolated ÎpetP complex in comparison with the dimeric wild-type complex, which binds two PetP subunits. The distinct behavior of linear and cyclic electron transport may suggest the presence of two distinguishable pools of cytochrome b6f complexes with different functions that might be correlated with supercomplex formation.

The class IA PI3K catalytic subunits (p110alpha, p110beta, and p110delta) occur in complex with a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing p85 regulatory subunit, which has been shown to link p110alpha and p110delta to Tyr kinase signaling pathways. The p84/p101 regulatory subunits of the p110gamma class IB PI3K lack SH2 domains and instead couple p110gamma to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we show, using small-molecule inhibitors with selectivity for p110beta and cells derived from a p110beta-deficient mouse line, that p110beta is not a major effector of Tyr kinase signaling but couples to GPCRs. In macrophages, both p110beta and p110gamma contributed to Akt activation induced by the GPCR agonist complement 5a, but not by the Tyr kinase ligand colony-stimulating factor-1. In fibroblasts, which express p110beta but not p110gamma, p110beta mediated Akt activation by the GPCR ligands stromal cell-derived factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and lysophosphatidic acid but not by the Tyr kinase ligands PDGF, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1. Introduction of p110gamma in these cells reduced the contribution of p110beta to GPCR signaling. Taken together, these data show that p110beta and p110gamma can couple redundantly to the same GPCR agonists. p110beta, which shows a much broader tissue distribution than the leukocyte-restricted p110gamma, could thus provide a conduit for GPCR-linked PI3K signaling in the many cell types where p110gamma expression is low or absent.\n\nThe p110Î² isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signals downstream of G protein-coupled receptors and is functionally redundant with p110Î³\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGuillermet-Guibert, Julie; Bjorklof, Katja; Salpekar, Ashreena; Gonella, Cristiano; Ramadani, Faruk; Bilancio, Antonio; Meek, Stephen; Smith, Andrew J.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RNase MRP comprises an RNA subunit and ten proteins. To improve our understanding of subunit roles and enzyme architecture, we have examined protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in vitro, complementing existing yeast two-hybrid data. In total, 31 direct protein-protein interactions were identified, each protein interacting with at least three others. Furthermore, seven proteins self-interact, four strongly, pointing to subunit multiplicity in the holoenzyme. Six protein subunits interact directly with MRP RNA and four with pre-rRNA. A comparative analysis with existing data for the yeast and human RNase P/MRP systems enables confident identification of Pop1p, Pop4p and Rpp1p as subunits that lie at the enzyme core, with probable addition of Pop5p and Pop3p. Rmp1p is confirmed as an integral subunit, presumably associating preferentially with RNase MRP, rather than RNase P, via interactions with Snm1p and MRP RNA. Snm1p and Rmp1p may act together to assist enzyme specificity, though roles in substrate binding are also indicated for Pop4p and Pop6p. The results provide further evidence of a conserved eukaryotic RNase P/MRP architecture and provide a strong basis for studies of enzyme assembly and subunit function.\n\nRole of phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory isoforms in development and actin rearrangement.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrachmann, Saskia M; Yballe, Claudine M; Innocenti, Metello; Deane, Jonathan A; Fruman, David A; Thomas, Sheila M; Cantley, Lewis C\n\n2005-04-01\n\nClass Ia phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are heterodimers of p110 catalytic and p85 regulatory subunits that mediate a variety of cellular responses to growth and differentiation factors. Although embryonic development is not impaired in mice lacking all isoforms of the p85alpha gene (p85alpha-/- p55alpha-/- p50alpha-/-) or in mice lacking the p85beta gene (p85beta-/-) (D. A.

Watt, C. R. Kahn, and L. C. Cantley, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:419-424, 2002), we show here that loss of both genes results in lethality at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5). The phenotypes of these embryos, including subepidermal blebs flanking the neural tube at E8 and bleeding into the blebs during the turning process, are similar to defects observed in platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha null (PDGFRalpha-/-) mice (P. Soriano, Development 124:2691-2700, 1997), suggesting that PI3K is an essential mediator of PDGFRalpha signaling at this developmental stage. p85alpha-/- p55alpha+/+ p50alpha+/+ p85beta-/- mice had similar but less severe defects, indicating that p85alpha and p85beta have a critical and redundant function in development. Mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in all p85alpha and p85beta gene products (p85alpha-/- p55alpha-/- p50alpha-/- p85beta-/-) are defective in PDGF-induced membrane ruffling. Overexpression of the Rac-specific GDP-GTP exchange factor Vav2 or reintroduction of p85alpha or p85beta rescues the membrane ruffling defect. Surprisingly, reintroduction of p50alpha also restored PDGF-dependent membrane ruffling. These results indicate that class Ia PI3K is critical for PDGF-dependent actin rearrangement but that the SH3 domain and the Rho/Rac/Cdc42-interacting domain of p85, which lacks p50alpha, are not required for this response.\n\nRegulatory Subunit Bâ²Î³ of Protein Phosphatase 2A Prevents Unnecessary Defense Reactions under Low Light in Arabidopsis1[W][OA\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTrotta, Andrea; Wrzaczek, Michael; Scharte, Judith; Tikkanen, Mikko; Konert, Grzegorz; Rahikainen, Moona; HolmstrÃ¶m, Maija; Hiltunen, Hanna-Maija; Rips, Stephan; Sipari, Nina; Mulo, Paula; Weis, Engelbert; von Schaewen, Antje; Aro, Eva-Mari; KangasjÃ¤rvi, Saijaliisa\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLight is an important environmental factor that modulates acclimation strategies and defense responses in plants. We explored the functional role of the regulatory subunit Bâ²Î³ (Bâ²Î³) of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in light-dependent stress responses of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The predominant form of PP2A consists of catalytic subunit C, scaffold subunit A, and highly variable regulatory subunit B, which determines the substrate specificity of PP2A holoenzymes. Mutant leaves of knockdown pp2a-bâ²Î³ plants show disintegration of chloroplasts and premature yellowing conditionally under moderate light intensity. The cell-death phenotype is accompanied by the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide through a pathway that requires CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF PR GENES5 (CPR5). Moreover, the pp2a-bâ²Î³ cpr5 double mutant additionally displays growth suppression and malformed trichomes. Similar to cpr5, the pp2a-bâ²Î³ mutant shows constitutive activation of both salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent defense pathways. In contrast to cpr5, however, pp2a-bâ²Î³ leaves do not contain increased levels of salicylic acid or jasmonic acid. Rather, the constitutive defense response associates with hypomethylation of DNA and increased levels of methionine-salvage pathway components in pp2a-bâ²Î³ leaves. We suggest that the specific Bâ²Î³ subunit of PP2A is functionally connected to CPR5 and operates in the basal repression of defense responses under low irradiance.

Western-analysis using anti-CK2(beta)tes Ig revealed CK2(beta)tes protein in Drosophila testes extract. Expression of a CK2(beta)tes-beta-galactosidase fusion protein driven by the CK2(beta)tes promoter was found in transgenic flies at postmitotic stages of spermatogenesis. Examination of biochemical characteristics of a recombinant CK2(beta)tes protein expressed in Escherichia coli revealed properties similar to those of CK2beta: (a) CK2(beta)tes protein stimulates CK2alpha catalytic activity toward synthetic peptide; (b) it inhibits phosphorylation of calmodulin and mediates stimulation of CK2alpha by polylysine; (c) it is able to form (CK2(beta)tes)2 dimers, as well as (CK2alpha)2(CK2(beta)tes)2 tetramers. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitation analysis of protein extract from Drosophila testes, we demonstrated an association between CK2(beta)tes and CK2alpha. Northern-analysis has shown that another regulatory (beta') subunit found recently in D. melanogaster genome is also testis-specific. Thus, we describe the first example of two tissue-specific regulatory subunits of CK2 which might serve to provide CK2 substrate recognition during spermatogenesis.\n\nImpact of rs361072 in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110beta gene on whole-body glucose metabolism and subunit protein expression in skeletal muscle.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibel-Madsen, Rasmus; Poulsen, Pernille; Holmkvist, Johan; Mortensen, Brynjulf; Grarup, Niels; Friedrichsen, Martin; JÃ¸rgensen, Torben; Lauritzen, Torsten; Wojtaszewski, JÃ¸rgen F P; Pedersen, Oluf; Hansen, Torben; Vaag, Allan\n\n2010-04-01\n\nPhosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a major effector in insulin signaling. rs361072, located in the promoter of the gene (PIK3CB) for the p110beta subunit, has previously been found to be associated with homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese subjects. The aim was to investigate the influence of rs361072 on in vivo glucose metabolism, skeletal muscle PI3K subunit protein levels, and type 2 diabetes. The functional role of rs361072 was studied in 196 Danish healthy adult twins. Peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity was assessed by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Basal and insulin-stimulated biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle, and tissue p110beta and p85alpha proteins were measured by Western blotting. The genetic association with type 2 diabetes and quantitative metabolic traits was investigated in 9,316 Danes with glucose tolerance ranging from normal to overt type 2 diabetes. While hepatic insulin resistance was similar in the fasting state, carriers of the minor G allele had lower hepatic glucose output (per-allele effect: -16%, P(add) = 0.004) during high physiological insulin infusion. rs361072 did not associate with insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose disposal despite a decreased muscle p85alpha:p110beta protein ratio (P(add) = 0.03) in G allele carriers. No association with HOMA-IR or type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.07, P = 0.5) was identified, and obesity did not interact with rs361072 on these traits. Our study suggests that the minor G allele of PIK3CB rs361072 associates with decreased muscle p85alpha:p110beta ratio and lower hepatic glucose production at high plasma insulin levels. However, no impact on type 2 diabetes prevalence was found.\n\nA tolerance gene for prenylated flavonoid encodes a 26S proteasome regulatory subunit in Sophora flavescens.\n\nPubMed\n\nShitan, Nobukazu; Kamimoto, Yoshihisa; Minami, Shota; Kubo, Mizuki; Ito, Kozue; Moriyasu, Masataka; Yazaki, Kazufumi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nYeast functional screening with a Sophora flavescens cDNA library was performed to identify the genes involved in the tolerant mechanism to the self-producing prenylated flavonoid sophoraflavanone G (SFG). One cDNA, which conferred SFG tolerance, encoded a regulatory particle triple-A ATPase 2 (SfRPT2), a member of the 26S proteasome subunit. The yeast transformant of SfRPT2 showed reduced SFG accumulation in the cells."
