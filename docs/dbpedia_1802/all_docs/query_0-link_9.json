        "text": "Prevalence of atrial arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nCamm, Christian F; James, Cynthia A; Tichnell, Crystal; Murray, Brittney; Bhonsale, Aditya; te Riele, Anneline S J M; Judge, Daniel P; Tandri, Harikrishna; Calkins, Hugh\n\n2013-11-01\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an inherited cardiomyopathy, characterized by right ventricular dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias. Limited information is available concerning atrial arrhythmias in ARVD/C. The purpose of this study was to characterize spontaneous atrial arrhythmias in a large registry population of ARVD/C patients. Patients (n = 248) from the Johns Hopkins ARVD/C registry who met the diagnostic criteria and had undertaken genotype analysis were included. Medical records of each were reviewed to ascertain incidence and characteristics of atrial arrhythmia episodes. Detailed demographic, phenotypic, and structural information was obtained from registry data. Thirty-five patients with ARVD/C (14%) experienced one or more types of atrial arrhythmia during median follow-up of 5.78 (interquartile range 8.52) years. Atrial fibrillation was the most common atrial arrhythmia, occurring in 80% of ARVD/C patients with atrial arrhythmias. Patients developed atrial arrhythmias at a mean age of 43.0 Â± 14.0 years. Atrial arrhythmia patients obtained a total of 22 inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks during follow-up. Older age at last follow-up (P <.001) and male gender (P = .044) were associated with atrial arrhythmia development. Patients with atrial arrhythmias had a higher occurrence of death (P = .028), heart failure (P <.001), and left atrial enlargement on echocardiography (P = .004). Atrial arrhythmias are common in ARVD/C and present at a younger age than in the general population. They are associated with male gender, increasing age, and left atrial enlargement. Atrial arrhythmias are clinically important as they are associated with inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks and increased risk of both death and heart failure.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism affects myocardial ACE levels. DD genotype favours myocardial fibrosis and is associated with malignant ventricular tachycardia. The aim of this study was to explore ACE gene polymorphism in ARVD patients. Twenty-nine patients with ARVD and 24 controls were included. All ARVD patients had documented sustained ventricular tachycardia. Thirteen patients had syncopal episodes. Six patients were resuscitated from sudden cardiac death. ACE gene polymorphism was identified by polymerase chain reaction technique. There was no significant difference in DD genotype frequency between ARVD patients and controls (44.8% vs. 45.8%, p=0.94). However, DD genotype frequency was significantly higher in ARVD patients with syncopal episodes compared to those without syncope (69.2% vs. 25.0%, p=0.017, odds ratio:6.750, 95% confidence interval: 1.318-34.565). DD genotype was detected in higher frequency also in patients with a family history of sudden cardiac death (66.7% vs. 39.1%,p=0.36). High prevalence of DD genotype in ARVD patients with syncope suggests that ACE I/D polymorphism might be useful in identifying high-risk patients for syncope.\n\nAn electrocardiographic scoring system for distinguishing right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy from idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoffmayer, Kurt S; Bhave, Prashant D; Marcus, Gregory M; James, Cynthia A; Tichnell, Crystal; Chopra, Nagesh; Moxey, Laura; Krahn, Andrew D; Dixit, Sanjay; Stevenson, William; Calkins, Hugh; Badhwar, Nitish; Gerstenfeld, Edward P; Scheinman, Melvin M\n\n2013-04-01\n\nVentricular arrhythmias in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) and idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) can share a left bundle branch block/inferior axis morphology. We previously reported electrocardiogram characteristics during outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias that helped distinguish VT related to ARVD/C from idiopathic VT. To prospectively validate these criteria. We created a risk score by using a derivation cohort. Two experienced electrophysiologists blinded to the diagnosis prospectively scored patients with VT/premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with left bundle branch block/inferior axis pattern in a validation cohort of 37 ARVD/C tracings and 49 idiopathic VT tracings. All patients with ARVD/C had their diagnosis confirmed based on the revised task force criteria. Patients with idiopathic VT were selected based on structurally normal hearts with documented right ventricular outflow tract VT successfully treated with ablation. The scoring system provides 3 points for sinus rhythm anterior T-wave inversions in leads V1-V3 and during ventricular arrhythmia: 2 points for QRS duration in lead Iâ¥120 ms, 2 points for QRS notching, and 1 point for precordial transition at lead V5 or later. A score of 5 or greater was able to correctly distinguish ARVD/C from idiopathic VT 93% of the time, with a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 91%. We describe a simple scoring algorithm that uses 12-lead electrocardiogram characteristics to effectively distinguish right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias originating from patients with ARVD/C versus patients with idiopathic VT.

Feature Tracking Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (FT-CMR) is a novel quantitative method that uses cine CMR to calculate strain values. However, most prior FT-CMR studies in ARVD/C have focused on global RV strain using different software methods, complicating implementation of FT-CMR in clinical practice. We aimed to assess the clinical value of global and regional strain using FT-CMR in ARVD/C and to determine differences between commercially available FT-CMR software packages. We analyzed cine CMR images of 110 subjects (39 overt ARVD/C [mutation+/phenotype+], 40 preclinical ARVD/C [mutation+/phenotype-] and 31 control) for global and regional (subtricuspid, anterior, apical) RV strain in the horizontal longitudinal axis using four FT-CMR software methods (Multimodality Tissue Tracking, TomTec, Medis and Circle Cardiovascular Imaging). Intersoftware agreement was assessed using Bland Altman plots. For global strain, all methods showed reduced strain in overt ARVD/C patients compared to control subjects (pÂ <Â 0.041), whereas none distinguished preclinical from control subjects (pÂ >Â 0.275). For regional strain, overt ARVD/C patients showed reduced strain compared to control subjects in all segments which reached statistical significance in the subtricuspid region for all software methods (pÂ <Â 0.037), in the anterior wall for two methods (pÂ <Â 0.005) and in the apex for one method (pÂ =Â 0.012). Preclinical subjects showed abnormal subtricuspid strain compared to control subjects using one of the software methods (pÂ =Â 0.009). Agreement between software methods for absolute strain values was low (Intraclass Correlation CoefficientÂ =Â 0.373). Despite large intersoftware variability of FT-CMR derived strain values, all four software methods distinguished\n\nInfluence of Genotype on Structural Atrial Abnormalities and Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter in Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/Cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBourfiss, Mimount; Te Riele, Anneline S J M; Mast, Thomas P; Cramer, Maarten J; VAN DER Heijden, Jeroen F; VAN Veen, Toon A B; Loh, Peter; Dooijes, Dennis; Hauer, Richard N W; Velthuis, Birgitta K\n\n2016-12-01\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is associated with desmosomal mutations. Although desmosomal disruption affects both ventricles and atria, little is known about atrial involvement in ARVD/C. To describe the extent and clinical significance of structural atrial involvement and atrial arrhythmias (AA) in ARVD/C stratified by genotype. We included 71 patients who met ARVD/C Task Force Criteria and underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and molecular genetic analysis. Indexed atrial end-diastolic volume and area-length-ejection-fraction (ALEF) were evaluated on CMR and compared to controls with idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (n = 40). The primary outcome was occurrence of AA (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) during follow-up, recorded by 12-lead ECG, Holter monitoring or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) interrogation. Patients harbored a desmosomal plakophilin-2 (PKP2) (n = 37) or nondesmosomal phospholamban (PLN) (n = 14) mutation. In 20 subjects, no pathogenic mutation was identified. Compared to controls, right atrial (RA) volumes were reduced in PKP2 (P = 0.002) and comparable in PLN (P = 0.441) mutation carriers. In patients with no mutation identified, RA (P = 0.011) and left atrial (P = 0.034) volumes were increased. Bi-atrial ALEF showed no significant difference between the groups. AA were experienced by 27% of patients and occurred equally among PKP2 (30%) and no mutation identified patients (30%), but less among PLN mutation carriers (14%). Genotype influences atrial volume and occurrence of AA in ARVD/C. While the incidence of AA is similar in PKP2 mutation carriers and patients with no mutation identified, PKP2 mutation carriers have significantly smaller atria. This suggests a different arrhythmogenic mechanism.

Pathology literature describes ventricular myocardial fat to be present not only in ARVD, but much more frequently related to aging, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and chronic ischemia. We noted focal ventricular myocardial fat in a group of patients who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) for varied indications. The aim of this study is to describe the noncontrast CT findings and clinical correlates of ventricular myocardial fat in this population. We prospectively identified 26 patients whose noncontrast chest CT (5/03 to 6/04) demonstrated ventricular myocardial fat and whose clinical charts were available. There were 14 men and 12 women with a mean age of 70 years. Twenty-three percent (6/26) had prior CTs. Each CT was reviewed by 3 radiologists in consensus. The site of the ventricular fat was noted. Each patient was categorized based on the location of the fat as follows: group 1-right ventricle (RV) only, group 2-left ventricle (LV) only, group 3-biventricular. Results of cardiac history, laboratory tests, and cardiac imaging were noted. The distribution of ventricular myocardial fat was: group 1 RV-27% (7/26), group 2 LV-46% (12/26), and group 3 biventricular-27% (7/26). Echocardiographic, nuclear cardiology, or electrocardiographic data localizing a prior MI to a specific site were available in 35% (9/26) of patients: 14% (1/7) of group 1, 50% (6/12) of group 2, and 29% (2/7) of group 3. Myocardial fat corresponded to the site of MI in 89% (8/9). The presence and distribution of ventricular fat on CT was unchanged from prior CT in 100% (6/6). When comparing group 1 and group 2, group 1 was older (77 vs. 64 y, P=0.005), more often female (57% vs. 17%, P=0.13) and had fewer prior MI (14% vs. 50%, P=0.17) than group 2. Only 1 patient in this series had ARVD. He was in group 3. The significance of ventricular myocardial fat varies by location.

Recent studies suggest an interaction between the desmosome and sodium channel protein Na v 1.5. We aimed to determine the prevalence and biophysical properties of mutations in SCN5A (the gene encoding Na v 1.5) in ARVD/C. We performed whole-exome sequencing in six ARVD/C patients (33% male, 38.2âÂ±â12.1 years) without a desmosomal mutation. We found a rare missense variant (p.Arg1898His; R1898H) in SCN5A in one patient. We generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hIPSC-CMs) from the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The variant was then corrected (R1898R) using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9 technology, allowing us to study the impact of the R1898H substitution in the same cellular background. Whole-cell patch clamping revealed a 36% reduction in peak sodium current (Pâ=â0.002); super-resolution fluorescence microscopy showed reduced abundance of Na V 1.5 (Pâ=â0.005) and N-Cadherin (Pâ=â0.026) clusters at the intercalated disc. Subsequently, we sequenced SCN5A in an additional 281 ARVD/C patients (60% male, 34.8âÂ±â13.7 years, 52% desmosomal mutation-carriers). Five (1.8%) subjects harboured a putatively pathogenic SCN5A variant (p.Tyr416Cys, p.Leu729del, p.Arg1623Ter, p.Ser1787Asn, and p.Val2016Met). SCN5A variants were associated with prolonged QRS duration (119âÂ±â15 vs. 94âÂ±â14âms, Pâ<â0.01) and all SCN5A variant carriers had major structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging. Almost 2% of ARVD/C patients harbour rare SCN5A variants. For one of these variants, we demonstrated reduced sodium current, Na v 1.5 and N-Cadherin clusters at junctional sites. This suggests that Na v 1.5 is in a functional complex with adhesion molecules, and reveals potential non-canonical mechanisms by which Na v 1.5 dysfunction causes cardiomyopathy.

Among clinical tests, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now becoming the most valid imaging technique to diagnose ARVD. Fatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall can be visible on cardiac MRI. Finding right-ventricle functional parameters from cardiac MRI images contains segmentation of right-ventricle in each slice of end diastole and end systole phases of cardiac cycle and calculation of end diastolic and end systolic volume and furthermore other functional parameters. The main problem of this task is the segmentation part. We used a robust method based on deformable model that uses shape information for segmentation of right-ventricle in short axis MRI images. After segmentation of right-ventricle from base to apex in end diastole and end systole phases of cardiac cycle, volume of right-ventricle in these phases calculated and then, ejection fraction calculated. We performed a quantitative evaluation of clinical cardiac parameters derived from the automatic segmentation by comparison against a manual delineation of the ventricles. The manually and automatically determined quantitative clinical parameters were statistically compared by means of linear regression. This fits a line to the data such that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the residuals is minimized. The results show low RMSE for Right Ventricle Ejection Fraction and Volume (â¤ 0.06 for RV EF, and â¤ 10 mL for RV volume). Evaluation of segmentation results is also done by means of four statistical measures including sensitivity, specificity, similarity index and Jaccard index. The average value of similarity index is 86.87%. The Jaccard index mean value is 83.85% which shows a good accuracy of segmentation. The average of sensitivity is 93.9% and mean value of the specificity is 89.45%.

We aimed to assess whether vectorcardiographic (VCG) parameters directed toward the right heart and a measured angle of the S-wave would help differentiate ARVD/C with otherwise normal electrocardiograms from controls. Task Force 2010 definite ARVD/C criteria were met for all patients. Those who did not fulfill Task Force depolarization or repolarization criteria (-ECG) were compared with age and gender-matched control subjects. Electrocardiogram measures of a 3-dimentional spatial QRS-T angle, a right-precordial-directed orthogonal QRS-T (RPD) angle, a root mean square of the right sided depolarizing forces (RtRMS-QRS), QRS duration (QRSd) and the corrected QT interval (QTc), and a measured angle including the upslope and downslope of the S-wave (S-wave angle) were assessed. Definite ARVD/C was present in 155 patients by 2010 Task Force criteria (41.7Â Â±Â 17.6Â years, 65.2% male). -ECG ARVD/C patients (66 patients) were compared to 66 control patients (41.7Â Â±Â 17.6Â years, 65.2% male). All parameters tested except the QRSd and QTc significantly differentiated -ECG ARVD/C from control patients (pÂ <Â 0.004 to pÂ <Â 0.001). The RPD angle and RtRMS-QRS best differentiated the groups. Combined, the 2 novel criteria gave 81.8% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity and odds ratio of 45.0 (95% confidence interval 15.8 to 128.2). ARVD/C disease process may lead to development of subtle ECG abnormalities that can be distinguishable using right-sided VCG or measured angle markers better than the spatial QRS-T angle, the QRSd or QTc, in the absence of Taskforce ECG criteria.\n\nTAIL1: an isthmin-like gene, containing type 1 thrombospondin-repeat and AMOP domain, mapped to ARVD1 critical region.\n\nPubMed\n\nRossi, Valeria; Beffagna, Giorgia; Rampazzo, Alessandra; Bauce, Barbara; Danieli, Gian Antonio\n\n2004-06-23\n\nIsthmins represent a novel family of vertebrate secreted proteins containing one copy of the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR), which in mammals is shared by several proteins with diverse biological functions, including cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and patterning of developing nervous system. We have determined the genomic organization of human TAIL1 (thrombospondin and AMOP containing isthmin-like 1), a novel isthmin-like gene encoding a protein that contains a TSR and a C-terminal AMOP domain (adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and other proteins), characteristic of extracellular proteins involved in adhesion processes. TAIL1 gene encompasses more than 24.4 kb. Analysis of the DNA sequence surrounding the putative transcriptional start region revealed a TATA-less promoter located in a CpG island. Several consensus binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and MZF-1 were identified in this promoter region. In humans, TAIL1 gene is located on chromosome 14q24.3 within ARVD1 (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, type 1) critical region; preliminary evidence suggests that it is expressed in several tissues, showing multiple alternative splicing.\n\nClinical validation of the planar radionuclide ventriculography in patients with right ventricular dysfunction.\n\nPubMed\n\nBontemps, L; Merabet, Y; Chevalier, P; Itti, R\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGated radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) may be used for the evaluation of the right ventricular function. However, the accuracy of the method should be clinically validated in patients suffering from diseases with specific pathology of the right ventricle (RV) and with possible left ventricular (LV) interaction. Three groups of 15 patients each, diagnosed with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) or atrial septal defect (ASD) were compared to a group of normal subjects. The parameters for both ventricles were evaluated separately (ejection fractions: LVEF and RVEF, and intraventricular synchronism quantified as phase standard deviation: LVPSD and RVPSD) as well as the relation or interdependence of the right to left ventricle (RV/LV volume ratio, LV/RV ejection fraction and stroke volume ratios, and interventricular synchronism). All the variables as a whole were analyzed to identify groups of patients according to their functional behaviour. Significant differences were found between the patients and control group for the RV function while the LV function remained mostly within normal limits. When the RV function was considered, the control group and ASD patient group showed differences regarding the ARVD and PAH patients. On evaluating the RV/LV ratios, differences were found between the control group and the ASD group. In the PAH patients, LV function showed differences in relation to the rest of the groups. RNV is a reliable clinical tool to evaluate RV function in patients with RV abnormality. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L. and SEMNIM.

Literature review and case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nCamargo-Ariza, William Alejandro; Galvis-Blanco, Silvia Juliana; Camacho-Enciso, Tatiana Del Pilar; Quiroz-Romero, Carlos Alberto; Bermudez-Echeverry, Juan JosÃ©\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia is an inherited autosomal dominant disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1:2,500 to 1:5,000, being higher in males (3:1). It is characterised histologically by the substitution of cardiomyocytes for fibrous-adipose tissue, which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias, right ventricular failure, and sudden cardiac death. The main aim of treatment is to reduce the risk of sudden death and improve the quality of life of patients. The case is presented of a 23 year old woman whose clinical symptoms started with palpitations, chest pain with physical activity, syncope, and headache, 6 years ago during her first pregnancy. Due to an increase in symptomatology, a stress test was performed, during which she collapsed with a sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. A cardiac magnetic resonance scan showed dilation, an increase in trabeculae, and decreased function of the right ventricle. A 3-dimensional mapping and ablation was performed, and during the isoproterenol infusion test, a polymorphic ventricular flutter was generated that required electrical cardioversion. The decision was made to implant a dual chamber cardioverter defibrillator and perform stellate ganglion ablation as secondary prevention. After her discharge, the patient re-consulted many times due to discharges of the device associated with palpitations. A comprehensive review of the patient's medical records was performed, finding characteristics that may suggest arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. The Task Force criteria was applied, concluding that, as she met more than 2 major criteria, the patient had a definitive diagnosis of this disease.

To evaluate performance of the algorithm, 365 arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy patients were classified as having a Class I, IIa, IIb, or III indication per the algorithm at baseline. Survival free from sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VT/VF) in follow-up was the primary outcome. Incidence of ventricular fibrillation/flutter cycle length <240 ms was also assessed. Two hundred twenty-four (61%) patients had a Class I implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indication; 80 (22%), Class IIa; 54 (15%), Class IIb; and 7 (2%), Class III. During a median 4.2 (interquartile range, 1.7-8.4)-year follow-up, 190 (52%) patients had VT/VF and 60 (16%) had ventricular fibrillation/flutter. Although the algorithm appropriately differentiated risk of VT/VF, incidence of VT/VF was underestimated (observed versus expected: 29.6 [95% confidence interval, 25.2-34.0] versus >10%/year Class I; 15.5 [confidence interval 11.1-21.6] versus 1% to 10%/year Class IIa). In addition, the algorithm did not differentiate survival free from ventricular fibrillation/flutter between Class I and IIa patients ( P =0.97) or for VT/VF in Class I and IIa primary prevention patients ( P =0.22). Adding Holter results (<1000 premature ventricular contractions/24 hours) to International Task Force Consensus classification differentiated risks. While the algorithm differentiates arrhythmic risk well overall, it did not distinguish ventricular fibrillation/flutter risks of patients with Class I and IIa implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications. Limited differentiation was seen for primary prevention cases.

He had implantation of a loop recorder that showed repetitive short episodes of VT. In addition, there were fragmented potentials immediately following the large and sharp electrograms (EGMs) before as well as after episodes of VT suggesting an Epsilon wave. This signal can be observed in multiple cardiac conditions including coronary artery disease. It was originally recorded on the epicardium as well as on the endocardium. However, in ARVD it can be defined as an electric signal observed after the end of the QRS complex in the right as opposed to the left precordial leads (differenceââ¥â25âms). It can also be an aid to the diagnosis of patients with ARVD who have other signs or symptoms suggesting ARVD including episodes of myocarditis. This potential consists of a slurring at the end of the QRS complex or an independent potential after the return to the isoelectric line. It can be better observed by increasing amplification of the ECG tracing as well as double speed using the Fontaine lead system. Epsilon wave too small to be recorded on the standard ECG can be extracted by Signal Averaging ECG SAECG). Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

Oculodentodigital dysplasia presents with a spectrum of clinical features including craniofacial, ocular, dental, and limb anomalies. Although recent findings implicate the major role of GJA1 during cardiac organogenesis, congenital heart defects are infrequently reported in oculodentodigital dysplasia. Here we report on two patients with GJA1 mutations presenting with cardiac malformations and type III syndactyly. Patient 1 presented with pulmonary atresia, an intact septum, right ventricular hypoplasia and tricuspid stenosis. The infant had a small nose, thin columella and bilateral 4-5 syndactyly of the fingers. A de novo c.226C>T (p.Arg76Cys) mutation was identified. Patient 2 presented at 6 months with a ventricular septal defect. The child had hypoplastic alae nasi with a thin columella and bilateral 4-5 syndactyly of the digits. A de novo missense mutation, c.145C>G (p.Gln49Glu) was found. Our two patients underscore the importance of cardiac evaluations as part of the initial workup for patients with findings of oculodentodigital dysplasia. Conversely, those patients with type III syndactyly and congenital heart defect should be screened for GJA1 mutations. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nKidney Dysplasia\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Her electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac magnetic resonance were diagnostic of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. There was no documented ventricular arrhythmia or syncopal episodes and Holter recordings were repeatedly normal. Cardiac hemodynamics showed right to left shunt through atrial septal defect, low pulmonary blood flow, normal atrial pressures, and minimally elevated right ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Since her presenting symptoms and cyanosis were attributed to reduced pulmonary blood flow, she underwent off-pump cavopulmonary anastomosis between right superior vena cava and right pulmonary artery. As we intended to avoid the adverse effect of extracorporeal circulation on the myocardial function and pulmonary vasculature, we did not attempt to reduce the size of the atrial septal defect. Her postoperative period was uneventful; oxygen saturation improved to 89% with significant improvement in effort tolerance. At 18-month follow-up, there were no ventricular arrhythmias on surveillance. The clinical presentation of this disease may vary from serious arrhythmias warranting defibrillators and electrical ablations at one end to right ventricular pump failure warranting cardiomyoplasty or right ventricular exclusion procedures at the other end. However, when the presentation was unusual with severe cyanosis through a stretched foramen ovale leading to reduced pulmonary blood flows, Glenn shunt served as a good palliation and should be considered as one of the options in such patients.\n\nCharacterization of the Left-Sided Substrate in Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerte, Benjamin; Denis, Arnaud; Amraoui, Sana; Yamashita, Seigo; Komatsu, Yuki; Pillois, Xavier; Sacher, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Mahida, Saagar; Wielandts, Jean-Yves; Sellal, Jean-Marc; Frontera, Antonio; Al Jefairi, Nora; Derval, Nicolas; Montaudon, Michel; Laurent, FranÃ§ois; Hocini, MÃ©lÃ¨ze; HaÃ¯ssaguerre, Michel; JaÃ¯s, Pierre; Cochet, Hubert\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe correlates of left ventricular (LV) substrate in arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) cardiomyopathy are largely unknown. Thirty-two patients with arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy (47Â±14 years; 6 women) were included. RV and LV dysplasia were defined from multidetector computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Arrhythmias were characterized as right-sided or left-sided on 12-lead ECG recordings at baseline and during isoproterenol testing. In 14 patients, the imaging substrate was compared with voltage mapping and local abnormal ventricular activity. Imaging abnormalities were found in 32 (100%) and 21 (66%) patients on the RV and LV, respectively, intramyocardial fat on multidetector computed tomography being the most sensitive feature. LV involvement related to none of the Task Force criteria. Right-sided arrhythmias were more frequent than left-sided arrhythmias (P=0.003) although the latter were more frequent in case of LV involvement (P=0.02). The agreement between low voltage and fat on multidetector computed tomography was high on the RV when using either endocardial unipolar or epicardial bipolar data (Îº=0.82 and Îº=0.78, respectively) but lower on the LV (Îº=0.54 for epicardial bipolar). LV local abnormal ventricular activity was found in all patients with LV involvement, and none of the others. The density of local abnormal ventricular activity within fat areas was similar between the RV and LV (P=0.57). LV substrate is frequent in arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, but poorly identified by current diagnostic strategies. Left-sided arrhythmias are more frequent in case of LV involvement. LV fat hosts the same density of local abnormal ventricular activity as RV fat, but is less efficiently detected by voltage mapping. These results support the need for alternative diagnostic strategies to identify LV dysplasia.

It has been observed that male patients develop the disease earlier and present with more severe phenotypes as compared to females. Thus, we hypothesized that serum levels of sex hormones may contribute to major arrhythmic cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with ARVC/D. The serum levels of five sex hormones, sex hormone-binding globulin, high sensitivity troponin T, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and glucose were measured in 54 ARVC/D patients (72% male). Twenty-six patients (48%) experienced MACE. Total and free testosterone levels were significantly increased in males with MACE as compared to males with a favourable outcome, whereas estradiol was significantly lower in females with MACE as compared to females with a favourable outcome. Increased testosterone levels remained independently associated with MACE in males after adjusting for age, body mass index, Task Force criteria, ventricular function, and desmosomal mutation status. Furthermore, an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ARVC/D cardiomyocyte model was used to investigate the effects of sex hormones. In this model, testosterone worsened and estradiol improved ARVC/D-related pathologies such as cardiomyocyte apoptosis and lipogenesis, strongly supporting our clinical findings. Elevated serum testosterone levels in males and decreased estradiol levels in females are independently associated with MACE in ARVC/D, and directly influence disease pathology. Therefore, determining the levels of sex hormones may be useful for risk stratification and may open a new window for preventive interventions.

The presence of late potentials as assessed by the signal averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) is a minor Task Force criterion. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic and clinical value of the SAECG in a large population of genotyped ARVC/D probands. Methods We compared the SAECGs of 87 ARVC/D probands (age 37 Â± 13 years, 47 males) diagnosed as affected or borderline by Task Force criteria without using the SAECG criterion with 103 control subjects. The association of SAECG abnormalities was also correlated with clinical presentation; surface ECG; VT inducibility at electrophysiologic testing; ICD therapy for VT; and RV abnormalities as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Results When compared with controls, all 3 components of the SAECG were highly associated with the diagnosis of ARVC/D (p<0.001). These include the filtered QRS duration (fQRSD) (97.8 Â± 8.7 msec vs. 119.6 Â± 23.8 msec), low amplitude signal (LAS) (24.4 Â± 9.2 msec vs. 46.2 Â± 23.7 msec) and root mean square amplitude of the last 40 msec of late potentials (RMS-40) (50.4 Â± 26.9 ÂµV vs. 27.9 Â± 36.3 ÂµV). The sensitivity of using SAECG for diagnosis of ARVC/D was increased from 47% using the established 2 of 3 criteria (i.e. late potentials) to 69% by using a modified criterion of any 1 of the 3 criteria, while maintaining a high specificity of 95%. Abnormal SAECG as defined by this modified criteria was associated with a dilated RV volume and decreased RV ejection fraction detected by cMRI (p<0.05). SAECG abnormalities did not vary with clinical presentation or reliably predict spontaneous or inducible VT, and had limited correlation with ECG findings. Conclusion Using 1 of 3 SAECG criteria contributed to increased sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ARVC/D.

However, several limitations have to be taken into consideration if using conventional echocardiographic parameters. Advanced echocardiographic techniques, such as speckle-tracking analysis or 3D echocardiography are reliable and simple tools providing a cost-effective and non-invasive alternative of current modalities used to characterize the right ventricle. There is a growing interest in the diagnostic and prognostic value of these methods regarding pathological (right ventricular infarction, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, follow-up of heart transplantation) and even physiological (athlete's heart) alterations of the right ventricle.

This study sought to determine prevalence and predictors of HF in ARVC/D. Clinical HF, defined as at least 1 HF sign or symptom, was retrospectively adjudicated for 289 patients meeting ARVC/D Task Force Criteria. HF was present in 142 patients (49%): 113 had isolated RV involvement and 29 had evidence of LV dysfunction. Average age of HF onset was 40Â±14 years. Most commonly reported symptoms were exertional dyspnea (78%) and fatigue (73%). Only 40% (n=57/142) had signs of volume overload. Left-sided HF signs were rare. Patients with clinical HF before ARVC/D diagnosis (n=31) were older ( P =0.005) and met fewer Task Force Criteria ( P =0.013) than those who developed HF after ARVC/D presentation. Female sex (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-4.01; P =0.01) and lateral precordial T-wave inversions (odds ratio, 9.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-91.1; P =0.043) were associated with increased odds of HF. Additionally, patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction had higher odds of lateral precordial T-wave inversions (odds ratio, 18.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.92-116.18; P =0.002). Patients with HF were more likely to undergo heart transplantation (15/142 versus 1/147; P <0.001) or die during study follow-up period (7 versus 0; P =0.007). HF symptoms, especially exertional dyspnea, are common in ARVC/D; yet, classic left-sided signs are typically absent and less than half have evidence of volume overload. Given the unique predominately right-sided phenotype, a large portion of patients with HF may be under-recognized.

Most observations have noted tricuspid valve clefts or dysplasia. We describe another mechanism for production of TR in association with paramembranous VSD. In 8 patients, we found significant TR produced by the VSD jet pushing the tricuspid anterior leaflet forward to open the tricuspid valve orifice. In these patients, a moderate paramembranous VSD extended slightly below the septal tricuspid leaflet with only partial obstruction of the VSD jet. All patients had restrictive VSD with low right ventricular pressure. This mechanism to produce TR was best defined by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, but current higher resolution imaging should allow correct diagnosis. We believe that when this mechanism for TR is found in association with a moderate VSD, surgical VSD closure is warranted.\n\nClinical and pathological findings of severe subvalvular aortic stenosis and mitral dysplasia in a rottweiler puppy.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernÃ¡ndez del Palacio, M J; BayÃ³n, A; Bernal, L J; CerÃ³n, J J; Navarro, J A\n\n1998-10-01\n\nSubvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) and mitral dysplasia were diagnosed in an asymptomatic eight-week-old rottweiler.

Affected patients may succumb to sudden cardiac death (SCD), ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) and heart failure. Genetic studies have identified causative mutations in genes encoding proteins of the intercalated disk that lead to reduced myocardial electro-mechanical stability. The term arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is somewhat misleading as biventricular involvement or isolated left ventricular (LV) involvement may be present and thus a broader term such as AVC should be preferred. The diagnosis is established on a point score basis according to the revised 2010 task force criteria utilizing imaging modalities, demonstrating fibrous replacement through biopsy, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias and a positive family history including identification of genetic mutations. Although several risk factors for SCD such as previous cardiac arrest, syncope, documented VTA, severe RV/LV dysfunction and young age at manifestation have been identified, risk stratification still needs improvement, especially in asymptomatic family members. Particularly, the role of genetic testing and environmental factors has to be further elucidated. Therapeutic interventions include restriction from physical exercise, beta-blockers, sotalol, amiodarone, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and catheter ablation. Life-long follow-up is warranted in symptomatic patients, but also asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic mutations.

The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is widely regarded as the only treatment modality with evidence to support improved survival in patients with ARVC and secondary prevention indications. In contrast, there is no universally accepted risk stratification scheme to guide ICD therapy for primary prevention against sudden cardiac death. Potential benefits must be weighed against the considerable risks of complications and inappropriate shocks in this young patient population. This article tackles the challenges of risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in ARVC and critically appraises available evidence for various proposed risk factors. The authors' over-arching objective is to provide the clinician with evidence-based guidance to inform decisions regarding the selection of appropriate candidates with ARVC for ICD therapy.\n\nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC/D): A Systematic Literature Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRomero, Jorge; Mejia-Lopez, Eliany; Manrique, Carlos; Lucariello, Richard\n\n2013-01-01\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is a genetic form of cardiomyopathy (CM) usually transmitted with an autosomal dominant pattern. It primary affects the right ventricle (RV), but may involve the left ventricle (LV) and culminate in biventricular heart failure (HF), life threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). It accounts for 11%â22% of cases of SCD in the young athlete population. Pathologically is characterized by myocardial atrophy, fibrofatty replacement and chamber dilation. Diagnosis is often difficult due to the nonspecific nature of the disease and the broad spectrum of phenotypic variations. Therefore consensus diagnostic criteria have been developed and combined electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and myocardial biopsy. Early detection, family screening and risk stratification are the cornerstones in the diagnostic evaluation. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, ablative procedures and heart transplantation are currently the main therapeutic options.

The epsilon wave is a major diagnostic criterion in the context of ARVC/D, which, however, remains not quantifiable and therefore may leave room for substantial subjective interpretation. The purpose of this study was to assess interobserver agreement in epsilon wave definition and epsilon wave importance for ARVC/D diagnosis. Electrocardiographic (ECG) tracings depicting leads V1, V2, and V3 collected from individuals evaluated for ARVC/D (n = 30) were given to panel members who were asked to respond to the question whether ECG patterns meet epsilon wave definition outlined by the Task Force diagnostic criteria. The prevalence and importance of epsilon waves for ARVC/D diagnosis were assessed in a pooled data set of patients with definite ARVC/D from European and American registries (n = 815). The number of ECG patterns identified as epsilon waves varied from 5 to 18 per reviewer (median 13 per reviewer). A unanimous agreement was reached for only 10 cases (33%), 2 of which qualified as epsilon waves and 8 as non-epsilon waves by all panel members. From a pooled data set, 106 patients reportedly had epsilon waves (13%). In 105 of 106 patients with epsilon waves (99%), exclusion of epsilon waves from the diagnostic score would not affect the \"definite\" diagnostic category. Interobserver variability in the assessment of epsilon waves is high; however, the impact of epsilon waves on ARVC/D diagnosis is negligibly low. The results urge to exercise caution in the assessment of epsilon waves, especially in patients who would not otherwise meet diagnostic criteria. Copyright Â© 2016 Heart Rhythm Society.

The clinical records and radiographs of patients diagnosed with osseous (cement-osseous) dysplasia were retrieved from the electronic health record of the University of Pittsburgh, School of Dental Medicine from 2007 to 2012. All cases were reviewed; the WHO criteria and classification for osseous dysplasia was used. Clinical and demographic data, radiographic findings, and final diagnoses were collected and analyzed. 35 cases of osseous dysplasia were retrieved over the six-year period.The majority (33) were females [94.3%], with ages ranging from 26 to 89 years, with a mean age of 53.9 years +/- standard deviation of 15.6 years, 32 [91.4%] were African Americans and 3 [8.6%] were Caucasians. 17 [48.6%] were florid osseous dysplasia, 13 [37.1%] periapical osseous dysplasia and 5 [14.3%] focal osseous dysplasia. Of the 35 patients only 8 [22.9%] patients were symptomatic. All florid osseous dysplasia patients were African American females, with 7 of the patients being symptomatic and the commonest symptom being pain. Also, all periapical osseous dysplasia patients were African Americans (12 females and 1 male), with 1 of the patients presenting with widening of the diastema. Of the focal osseous dysplasia patients, 3 were Caucasians and 2 African American (4 females and 1 male). The cases occurred mostly in African American females with a peak incidence in the fifth and sixth decades of life; most cases occurred in the mandible. The commonest form of osseous dysplasias was the florid osseous dysplasia which is most likely to present with symptoms.\n\nEctrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia clefting syndrome (EEC syndrome).\n\nPubMed\n\nKoul, Monika; Dwivedi, Rahul; Upadhyay, Vinod\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEctrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia- clefting syndrome (also k/a. split hand- split foot malformation /split hand-split foot ectodermal dysplasia- cleft syndrome/ectodermal dysplasia cleft lip/cleft palate syndrome) a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, is an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as a genetic trait and characterized by a triad of (i) ectrodactyly, (ii) ectodermal dysplasia and, (iii) & facial clefts.\n\nAdded value of cardiac magnetic resonance in etiological diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nPubMed\n\nCabanelas, Nuno; Vidigal Ferreira, Maria JoÃ£o; Donato, Paulo; Gaspar, AntÃ³nio; Pinto, Joana; Caseiro-Alves, Filipe; ProvidÃªncia, LuÃ­s Augusto\n\n2013-10-01\n\nCardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is increasingly important in the diagnostic work-up of a wide range of heart diseases, including those with arrhythmogenic potential. To assess the added value of CMR in etiological diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias after an inconclusive conventional investigation. Patients undergoing CMR between 2005 and 2011 for investigation of ventricular arrhythmias were included (n=113). All had documented arrhythmias. Those with a definite diagnosis from a previous investigation and those with evidence of coronary artery disease (acute coronary syndrome, typical angina symptoms, increase in biomarkers or positive stress test) were excluded. CMR results were considered relevant when they fulfilled diagnostic criteria. Of the 113 patients, 57.5% were male and mean age was 41.7 Â± 16.2 years. Regarding the initial arrhythmia, 38.1% had ventricular fibrillation/sustained ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) and 61.9% had less complex ventricular ectopy. CMR imaging showed criteria of a specific diagnosis in 42.5% of patients, was totally normal in 36.3%, and showed non-specific alterations in the remainder. In VF/VT patients, specific criteria were found in 60.4%, and in 31.4% of those with less complex ectopy. The most frequent diagnoses were arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, ventricular non-compaction and myopericarditis. It is worth noting that, although there was no evidence of previous coronary artery disease, 6.2% of patients had a late gadolinium enhancement distribution pattern compatible with myocardial infarction. CMR gives additional and important information in the diagnostic work-up of ventricular arrhythmias after an inconclusive initial investigation. The proportion of patients with diagnostic criteria was 42.5% (60.0% in those with VF/VT), and CMR was completely normal in 36.6%. Copyright Â© 2012 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of NLVS in juvenile sudden cardiac death and to ascertain its etiology at autopsy. We examined 281 consecutive cases of sudden death of subjects aged 1 to 35 years. NLVS was defined as a thin, gray rim of subepicardial and/or midmyocardial scar in the left ventricular free wall and/or the septum, in absence of significant stenosis of coronary arteries. NLVS was the most frequent finding (25%) in sudden deaths occurring during sports. Myocardial scar was localized most frequently within the left ventricular posterior wall and affected the subepicardial myocardium, often extending to the midventricular layer. On histology, it consisted of fibrous or fibroadipose tissue. Right ventricular involvement was always present. Patchy lymphocytic infiltrates were frequent. Genetic and molecular analyses clarified the etiology of NLVS in a subset of cases. Electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings were available in more than half of subjects. The most frequent abnormality was the presence of low QRS voltages (<0.5 mV) in limb leads. In serial ECG tracings, the decrease in QRS voltages appeared, in some way, progressive. NLVS is the most frequent morphologic substrate of juvenile cardiac sudden death in sports. It can be suspected based on ECG findings. Autopsy study and clinical screening of family members are required to differentiate between arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia and chronic acquired myocarditis.

Exercise recommendations for family members remain undetermined. The purposes of this study were to determine if (1) endurance exercise (Bethesda class C) and exercise intensity (metabolic equivalent hours per year [MET-Hr/year]) increase the likelihood of fulfilling 2010 Task Force Criteria and ventricular arrhythmias/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation [VT/VF]), and (2) exercise restriction to the American Heart Association (AHA)-recommended minimum for healthy adults is associated with favorable outcomes of at-risk family members. Twenty-eight family members of 10 probands inheriting a PKP2 mutation were interviewed about exercise from age 10. Exercise threshold to maintain overall health was based on the 2007 AHA guidelines of a minimum 390 to 650 MET-Hr/year. After adjustment for age, sex, and family membership, both participation in endurance athletics (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, P = .03) and higher-intensity exercise (OR = 4.2, P = .004) were associated with diagnosis (n = 13). Endurance athletes were also significantly more likely to develop VT/VF (n = 6, P = .02). Family members who restricted exercise at or below the upper bound of the AHA goal (â¤650 MET-Hr/year) were significantly less likely to be diagnosed (OR = 0.07, P = .002) and had no VT/VF. At diagnosis and first VT/VF, family members had accumulated 2.8-fold (P = .002) and 3.5-fold (P = .03), respectively, greater MET-Hr exercise than the AHA-recommended minimum. Those who developed VT/VF had performed particularly high-intensity exercise in adolescence compared to unaffected family members (age 10-14: P = .04; age 14-19: P = .02). The results of this study suggest restricting unaffected desmosomal mutation carriers from endurance and high-intensity athletics but potentially not from AHA\n\nUpper-extremity phocomelia reexamined: a longitudinal dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoldfarb, Charles A; Manske, Paul R; Busa, Riccardo; Mills, Janith; Carter, Peter; Ezaki, Marybeth\n\n2005-12-01\n\nIn contrast to longitudinal deficiencies, phocomelia is considered a transverse, intercalated segmental dysplasia. Most patients demonstrate severe, but not otherwise classifiable, upper-extremity deformities, which usually cannot be placed into one of three previously described phocomelia groups. Additionally, these phocomelic extremities do not demonstrate true segmental deficits; the limb is also abnormal proximal and distal to the segmental defect. The purpose of this investigation was to present evidence that upper-extremity abnormalities in patients previously diagnosed as having phocomelia in fact represent a proximal continuum of radial or ulnar longitudinal dysplasia. The charts and radiographs of forty-one patients (sixty extremities) diagnosed as having upper-extremity phocomelia were reviewed retrospectively. On the basis of the findings on the radiographs, the disorders were categorized into three groups: (1) proximal radial longitudinal dysplasia, which was characterized by an absent proximal part of the humerus, a nearly normal distal part of the humerus, a completely absent radius, and a radial-sided hand dysplasia; (2) proximal ulnar longitudinal dysplasia, characterized by a short one-bone upper extremity that bifurcated distally and by severe hand abnormalities compatible with ulnar dysplasia; and (3) severe combined dysplasia, with type A characterized by an absence of the forearm segment (i.e., the radius and ulna) and type B characterized by absence of the arm and forearm (i.e., the hand attached to the thorax). Twenty-nine limbs in sixteen patients could be classified as having proximal radial longitudinal dysplasia. Systemic medical conditions such as thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome were common in those patients, but additional musculoskeletal conditions were rare. Twenty limbs in seventeen patients could be classified as having proximal ulnar longitudinal dysplasia. Associated musculoskeletal abnormalities, such as proximal femoral\n\nExpansive focal cemento-osseous dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBulut, Emel Uzun; Acikgoz, Aydan; Ozan, Bora; Zengin, Ayse Zeynep; Gunhan, Omer\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo present a case of expansive focal cemento-osseous dysplasia and emphasize the importance of differential diagnosis. Cemento-osseous dysplasia is categorized into three subtypes on the basis of the clinical and radiographic features: Periapical, focal and florid. The focal type exhibits a single site of involvement in any tooth-bearing or edentulous area of the jaws. These lesions are usually asymptomatic; therefore, they are frequently diagnosed incidentally during routine radiographic examinations. Lesions are usually benign, show limited growth, and do not require further surgical intervention, but periodic follow-up is recommended because occasionally, this type of dysplasia progresses into florid osseous dysplasia and simple bone cysts are formed. A 24-year-old female patient was referred to our clinic for swelling in the left edentulous mandibular premolarmolar region and felt discomfort when she wore her prosthetics. She had no pain, tenderness or paresthesia. Clinical examination showed that the swelling in the posterior mandible that was firm, nonfluctuant and covered by normal mucosa. On panoramic radiography and computed tomography, a well defined lesion of approximately 1.5 cm in diameter of mixed density was observed. The swelling increased slightly in size over 2 years making it difficult to use prosthetics and, therefore, the lesion was totally excised under local anesthesia, and surgical specimens were submitted for histopathological examination. The histopathological diagnosis was focal cemento-osseous dysplasia. In the present case, because of the increasing size of the swelling making it difficult to use prosthetics, young age of the patient and localization of the lesion, in the initial examination, cemento-ossifying fibroma was suspected, and the lesion was excised surgically; the histopathological diagnosis confirmed it as focal cemento-osseous dysplasia. We present a case of expansive focal cemento-osseous dysplasia.

Table 1 and Figure 4 are presented to facilitate the comparison between the many different types of mesomelic dwarfism. Differential diagnosis between these types is not difficult because of the specific bone changes and extraskeletal malformations present. As in many hereditary syndromes, however, there may be wide clinical variability within a single entity, and meticulous clinical and radiologic examination must be done to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Certain other forms of chondrodystrophies, such as achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, pseudoachondroplasia and distrophic dwarfism, can be easily differentiated from the mesomelic dysplasias by their clinical features and skeletal radiographs. Nothing is known about the pathogenesis of the various forms of mesomelic dysplasias. There is no available specific treatment, although corrective surgery has benefited selected patients. The correct diagnosis is, however, important both for prognostication and accurate genetic counseling.\n\nIncessant atrial tachycardias in a dog with tricuspid dysplasia. Clinical management and electrophysiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Madron, E; Kadish, A; Spear, J F; Knight, D H\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIn a dog, tricuspid regurgitation due to congenital tricuspid dysplasia resulted in extreme right heart enlargement and right heart failure. Incessant supraventricular tachycardias were present, requiring the intravenous administration of verapamil to reduce the ventricular rate. Oral therapy using a combination of verapamil and quinidine was partially effective in controlling the ventricular rate during the following week. At that time, electrophysiologic studies were performed. They revealed that a succession of several atrial tachycardias with different cycle lengths, including one episode of atrial flutter, was present. Atrial activity was spanning the majority of the cycle length in all these arrhythmias. Epicardial mapping was performed during the atrial flutter. This enabled the detection of a depolarization wave-front traveling counterclockwise from the dorsolateral right atrium toward the right appendage, following the tricuspid valve annulus. No areas of abnormal conduction were detected. Because programmed electric stimulation maneuvers could not be performed, definitive conclusions about the mechanism of the arrhythmia could not be drawn. The two most likely possibilities were circus movement using part of the dilated tricuspid valve annulus as an anatomic barrier or a leading circle type of re-entry.\n\nEctodermal Dysplasia: A Genetic Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPrashanth, S\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract Ectodermal dysplasia is a rare hereditary disorder with a characteristic physiognomy. It is a genetic disorder affecting the development or function of the teeth, hair, nails and sweat glands. Depending on the particular syndrome ectodermal dysplasia can also affect the skin, the lens or retina of the eye, parts of the inner ear, the development of fingers and toes, the nerves and other parts of the body. Each syndrome usually involves a different combination of symptoms, which can range from mild to severe. The history and lessons learned from hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) may serve as an example for unraveling of the cause and pathogenesis of other ectodermal dysplasia syndromes by demonstrating that phenotypically identical syndromes can be caused by mutations in different genes (EDA, EDAR, EDARADD), that mutations in the same gene can lead to different phenotypes and that mutations in the genes further downstream in the same signaling pathway (NEMO) may modify the phenotype quite profoundly. The aim of this paper is to describe and discuss the etiology, genetic review, clinical manifestations and treatment options of this hereditary disorder.

There are several types of campomelic dysplasia; however, it is characterized by the presence of anteriorly bowed tibias with cutaneous dimpling, anterolaterally bowed femurs, thoracic kyphoscoliosis, hypoplastic scapulas, and absence or delayed ossification of thoracic pedicles. With improving treatment of respiratory insufficiency, the survival rate of affected infants has increased, thereby necessitating treatment of the musculoskeletal malformations to prevent additional morbidity. In an attempt to increase awareness of the presentation of infants with campomelic dysplasia and to emphasize the difficulties of treating associated developmental dislocation of the hip early, the current authors report the case of a 2-year-old girl with campomelic dysplasia who was treated for dislocation of the right hip. The postoperative course of this child was complicated seriously by several apneic episodes secondary to tracheobronchial malacia for which she required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit.\n\nGenetics Home Reference: cranioectodermal dysplasia\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

Comparative human temporal bone study. We assessed the sensory epithelium of the human vestibular system with a focus on the number of type I and type II hair cells, as well as the total number of hair cells. We compared those numbers in our Mondini dysplasia group versus our control group. The loss of type I and type II hair cells in the cristae of the superior, lateral, and posterior semicircular canals, as well as in the saccular and utricular macula, was significantly higher in our Mondini dysplasia group than in our control group.

A retrospective review was performed from 2005 to 2009. Infants treated with sildenafil citrate for greater than 48 âh were included. Standard patient data was collected, including echocardiogram, inspired oxygen and systemic blood pressure, before and during administration of sildenafil citrate. Sildenafil citrate was used in 21 preterm infants with BPD-associated PH. A significant reduction in estimated right ventricular peak systolic pressure was seen after initiation of sildenafil citrate, with the majority of infants showing no improvement in gas exchange at 48 âh of treatment. Four infants died during treatment. Sildenafil citrate reduced estimated pulmonary artery pressures, but this reduction was not reflected in improved gas exchange within the first 48 âh.\n\nDentomaxillofacial characteristics of ectodermal dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakayama, Yumiko; Baba, Yoshiyuki; Tsuji, Michiko; Fukuoka, Hiroki; Ogawa, Takuya; Ohkuma, Mizue; Moriyama, Keiji\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe aim of this retrospective hospital-based study was to elucidate the dentomaxillofacial characteristics of ectodermal dysplasia. Six Japanese individuals (one male and five female; age range, 12.7-27.2 years) underwent comprehensive examinations, including history recording, cephalometric analysis, panoramic radiography, and analysis of dental models. All the subjects had two or more major manifestations for clinical diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia (e.g., defects of hair, teeth, nails, and sweat glands). They presented hypodontia (mean number of missing teeth, 9.5; range, 5-14), especially in the premolar region, and enamel dysplasia. Five subjects had bilateral molar occlusion, whereas one subject had unilateral molar occlusion. The common skeletal features were small facial height, maxillary hypoplasia, counterclockwise rotation of the mandible, and mandibular protrusion. Interestingly, the maxillary first molars were located in higher positions and the upper anterior facial height was smaller than the Japanese norm. The results suggest that vertical and anteroposterior maxillary growth retardation, rather than lack of occlusal support due to hypodontia, leads to reduced anterior facial height in individuals with ectodermal dysplasia.

In a prospective multicenter study of 239 extremely preterm infants (<29Â weeks gestation at birth), left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global longitudinal systolic strain rate (GLSRs), interventricular septal wall (IVS) GLS and GLSRs, right ventricular (RV) free wall longitudinal strain and strain rate, and segmental longitudinal strain in the RV free wall, LV free wall, and IVS were serially measured on days 1, 2, and 5 to 7, at 32 and 36Â weeks postmenstrual age, and at 1Â year corrected age (CA). Premature infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia or had echocardiographic findings of pulmonary hypertension were analyzed separately. In uncomplicated preterm infants (nÂ =Â 103 [48%]), LV GLS and GLSRs remained unchanged from days 5 to 7 to 1Â year CA (PÂ =Â .60 and PÂ =Â .59). RV free wall longitudinal strain, RV free wall longitudinal strain rate, and IVS GLS and GLSRs significantly increased over the same time period (PÂ <Â .01 for all measures). A significant base-to-apex (highest to lowest) segmental longitudinal strain gradient (PÂ <Â .01) was seen in the RV free wall and a reverse apex-to-base gradient (PÂ <Â .01) in the LV free wall. In infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or pulmonary hypertension (nÂ =Â 119 [51%]), RV free wall longitudinal strain and IVS GLS were significantly lower (PÂ <Â .01), LV GLS and GLSRs were similar (PÂ =Â .56), and IVS segmental longitudinal strain persisted as an RV-dominant base-to-apex gradient from 32Â weeks postmenstrual age to 1Â year CA.

The study was conducted between 2006 and 2008 and included 23 patients diagnosed with ectodermal dysplasia. The major symptoms of ectodermal dysplasia were evaluated. Patient histories were obtained in all cases, and a complete head and neck examination was carried out. Of the 23 patients (11 males and 12 females, aged 5 to 45 years) diagnosed with ectodermal dysplasia, 22 had hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and 1 had ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome. In all patients diagnosed with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, the salivary glands were examined by ultrasonography and, when necessary, by scintigraphy. Hearing defects in patients with otologic problems were determined by audiometric examination: 39.1% of the patients had hearing loss, 43.5% had otitis media, and 39.1% had impacted cerumen. The most common rhinologic findings were saddle nose deformity in 56.5%, nasal obstruction and nasal dryness (52.2% each), and chronic rhinitis/rhinosinusitis (34.8%). The most common oral and oropharyngeal findings were difficulty chewing in 82.6% and dry mouth in 78.3%. All 23 patients had required dental work. Because this disorder affects several aspects of the body, its treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, with the otolaryngologist being a vital part of the management team.\n\nEctodermal dysplasia (ED) syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nChee, Siew-Yin; Wanga, Chung-Hsing; Lina, Wei-De; Tsaia, Fuu-Jen\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEctodermal dysplasia (ED) syndrome comprises a large, heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that are defined by primary defects in the development of 2 or more tissues derived from the embryonic ectoderm.

Urinary tract infection was the most common complaint. 4 patients were diagnosed in utero by ultrasound and 5 infants presented an abdominal mass. Hypertension was documented in a newborn baby. Ipsilateral lower urinary tract anomalies were found in 12 patients and those of the contralateral kidney in 2 children. There were 3 cases of extrarenal anomalies. Histological examination revealed 13 cases of multicystic dysplasia and 9 of solid dysplasia. Metaplastic cartilage was found in 1 case. In the group of segmental dysplasia, age ranging from 27 weeks' gestation to 8 years, at the time of the diagnosis. They all had duplex kidneys and 4 had ureterocele. Histological study in these cases was similar to the one found in the previous series, although superimposed inflammatory changes were more pronounced. Some of the theories regarding the pathogenesis of this disorder are reviewed and the importance of its diagnosis is emphasised.\n\nNeuromotor outcomes in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaragianni, Paraskevi; Tsakalidis, Christos; Kyriakidou, Maria; Mitsiakos, Georgios; Chatziioanidis, Helias; Porpodi, Maria; Evangeliou, Athanasios; Nikolaides, Nikolaos\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe examine the neuromotor outcomes of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Two hundred and nineteen infants (gestational age, â¤ 32 weeks; birth weight, â¤ 1500 g) were studied. Neuromotor development was assessed using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. All potential risk factors associated with neuromotor scores (P < 0.015) were included in the generalized linear model (multiple linear regression) to determine if bronchopulmonary dysplasia had an independent relationship with neuromotor scores. Infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia had lower global scores at ages 6 and 12 months. After adjustment for confounding factors, scores of infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia were reduced by 13.2 units, whereas scores for those with periventricular leukomalacia were reduced by 11.1 units, at age 6 months. At age 12 months, scores for those with periventricular leukomalacia were reduced by 11.9 units. Duration of hospital stay reduced scores by 0.1 for each additional day increase in hospital. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia constitutes a major cause of poor neuromotor outcomes at age 6 months, but improvements in motor outcomes occur over time. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

They occur in approximately 1/5,000 births, and some are lethal. Since the most recent publication of the Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders, genetic causes of 56 skeletal disorders have been uncovered. This remarkable rate of discovery is largely due to the expanded use of high-throughput genomic technologies. In this review, we discuss these recent discoveries and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind these skeletal dysplasia phenotypes. We also cover potential therapies, unusual genetic mechanisms, and novel skeletal syndromes both with and without known genetic causes. The acceleration of skeletal dysplasia genetics is truly spectacular, and these advances hold great promise for diagnostics, risk prediction, and therapeutic design.

It is more commonly seen in middle-aged black women. Most cases are asymptomatic and are found during routine radiographic examination. We report two complicated cases of florid cemento-osseous dysplasia, one with facial deformity and the other with chronic osteitis. The diagnosis of florid cemento-osseous dysplasia is based on clinical and radiological features. The lesions are commonly bilateral and symmetrical. Copyright Â© 2011.

There are 2 major types of this disorder, based on clinical findings: hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. This clinical classification is very important because clinical professionals involved with this disease need first a clear and practical method of diagnosis. The main oral manifestation of ectodermal dysplasia may be expressed as hypodontia. Thus, dental professionals may be the first to diagnose ectodermal dysplasia. The present article reports one case of each of the main types (hypohidrotic and hidrotic) of ectodermal dysplasia and the authors review the literature regarding the pathogenesis, clinical features, and therapeutic management of this condition.\n\nMÃ¼llerian agenesis with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhaley, Katie; Winter, Jordan; Eyster, Kathleen M; Hansen, Keith A\n\n2012-04-01\n\nTo describe the association of mÃ¼llerian agenesis with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. Case report. University medical center. A 17-year-old woman with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia referred for evaluation of primary amenorrhea. History, physical examination, and ultrasound. Physical findings of these two syndromes. Physical examination and ultrasound demonstrated mÃ¼llerian agenesis with findings of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. This is the first description of the association of mÃ¼llerian agenesis with ectodermal dysplasia. This rare case might provide further insight into the development of the uterus and the ectoderm as well as its derivatives. Copyright Â© 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
