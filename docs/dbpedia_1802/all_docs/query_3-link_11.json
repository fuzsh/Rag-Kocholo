        "text": "Advances in Skeletal Dysplasia Genetics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGeister, Krista A.; Camper, Sally A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSkeletal dysplasias result from disruptions in normal skeletal growth and development and are a major contributor to severe short stature. They occur in approximately 1/5,000 births, and some are lethal. Since the most recent publication of the Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders, genetic causes of 56 skeletal disorders have been uncovered. This remarkable rate of discovery is largely due to the expanded use of high-throughput genomic technologies. In this review, we discuss these recent discoveries and our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind these skeletal dysplasia phenotypes. We also cover potential therapies, unusual genetic mechanisms, and novel skeletal syndromes both with and without known genetic causes. The acceleration of skeletal dysplasia genetics is truly spectacular, and these advances hold great promise for diagnostics, risk prediction, and therapeutic design.

Other clinical features include Dandy-Walker malformation, congenital heart defects, joint contractures, genital hypoplasia, and distinctive facial features. These sibs appear to have a previously undescribed skeletal dysplasia, which is most likely inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

This group of disorders has very characteristic clinical and radiologic features, which distinguish them from other skeletal dysplasias. They display a spectrum of severity in the skeletal findings, ranging from relatively mild hypochondroplasia to lethal thanatophoric dysplasia. We report a patient who has the missense FGFR3 mutation, Lys650Met, previously reported in association only with SADDAN, who exhibits some findings similar to both thanatophoric dysplasia (types 1 and 2) in addition to those findings characteristic of SADDAN.\n\nExpanding the phenome and variome of skeletal dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaddirevula, Sateesh; Alsahli, Saud; Alhabeeb, Lamees; Patel, Nisha; Alzahrani, Fatema; Shamseldin, Hanan E; Anazi, Shams; Ewida, Nour; Alsaif, Hessa S; Mohamed, Jawahir Y; Alazami, Anas M; Ibrahim, Niema; Abdulwahab, Firdous; Hashem, Mais; Abouelhoda, Mohamed; Monies, Dorota; Al Tassan, Nada; Alshammari, Muneera; Alsagheir, Afaf; Seidahmed, Mohammed Zain; Sogati, Samira; Aglan, Mona S; Hamad, Muddathir H; Salih, Mustafa A; Hamed, Ahlam A; Alhashmi, Nadia; Nabil, Amira; Alfadli, Fatima; Abdel-Salam, Ghada M H; Alkuraya, Hisham; Peitee, Winnie Ong; Keng, W T; Qasem, Abdullah; Mushiba, Aziza M; Zaki, Maha S; Fassad, Mahmoud R; Alfadhel, Majid; Alexander, Saji; Sabr, Yasser; Temtamy, Samia; Ekbote, Alka V; Ismail, Samira; Hosny, Gamal Ahmed; Otaify, Ghada A; Amr, Khalda; Al Tala, Saeed; Khan, Arif O; Rizk, Tamer; Alaqeel, Aida; Alsiddiky, Abdulmonem; Singh, Ankur; Kapoor, Seema; Alhashem, Amal; Faqeih, Eissa; Shaheen, Ranad; Alkuraya, Fowzan S\n\n2018-04-05\n\nPurposeTo describe our experience with a large cohort (411 patients from 288 families) of various forms of skeletal dysplasia who were molecularly characterized.MethodsDetailed phenotyping and next-generation sequencing (panel and exome).ResultsOur analysis revealed 224 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (54 (24%) of which are novel) in 123 genes with established or tentative links to skeletal dysplasia. In addition, we propose 5 genes as candidate disease genes with suggestive biological links (WNT3A, SUCO, RIN1, DIP2C, and PAN2). Phenotypically, we note that our cohort spans 36 established phenotypic categories by the International Skeletal Dysplasia Nosology, as well as 18 novel skeletal dysplasia phenotypes that could not be classified under these categories, e.g., the novel C3orf17-related skeletal dysplasia. We also describe novel phenotypic aspects of well-known disease genes, e.g., PGAP3-related Toriello-Carey syndrome-like phenotype. We note a strong founder effect for many genes in our cohort, which allowed us to calculate a minimum disease burden for the autosomal recessive forms of skeletal dysplasia in our population (7.16E-04), which is much higher than the global average.ConclusionBy expanding the phenotypic, allelic, and locus heterogeneity of skeletal dysplasia in humans, we hope our study will improve the diagnostic rate of patients with these conditions.GENETICS in MEDICINE advance online publication, 5 April 2018; doi:10.1038/gim.2018.50.\n\nSkeletal dysplasia in ancient Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nKozma, Chahira\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe ancient Egyptian civilization lasted for over 3000 years and ended in 30 BCE. Many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture, including the existence of skeletal dysplasias, and in particular achondroplasia, are well known through the monuments and records that survived until modern times. The hot and dry climate in Egypt allowed for the preservation of bodies and skeletal anomalies. The oldest dwarf skeleton, the Badarian skeleton (4500 BCE), possibly represents an epiphyseal disorder. Among the remains of dwarfs with achondroplasia from ancient Egypt (2686-2190 BCE), exists a skeleton of a pregnant female, believed to have died during delivery with a baby's remains in situ. British museums have partial skeletons of dwarfs with achondroplasia, humeri probably affected with mucopolysaccharidoses, and a skeleton of a child with osteogenesis imperfecta. Skeletal dysplasia is also found among royal remains. The mummy of the pharaoh Siptah (1342-1197 BCE) shows a deformity of the left leg and foot. A mummified fetus, believed to be the daughter of king Tutankhamun, has scoliosis, spina bifida, and Sprengel deformity. In 2006 I reviewed the previously existing knowledge of dwarfism in ancient Egypt. The purpose of this second historical review is to add to that knowledge with an expanded contribution. The artistic documentation of people with skeletal dysplasia from ancient Egypt is plentiful including hundreds of amulets, statues, and drawing on tomb and temple walls. Examination of artistic reliefs provides a glance of the role of people with skeletal dysplasia and the societal attitudes toward them. Both artistic evidence and moral teachings in ancient Egypt reveal wide integration of individuals with disabilities into the society.

Currently, there are no effective treatments for these skeletal dysplasia diseases. In this study, we screened, using FGFR3 as a bait, a random 12-peptide phage library and obtained 23 positive clones that share identical amino acid sequences (VSPPLTLGQLLS), named as peptide P3. This peptide had high binding specificity to the extracellular domain of FGFR3. P3 inhibited tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR3 and its typical downstream molecules, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase. P3 also promoted proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of cultured ATDC5 chondrogenic cells. In addition, P3 alleviated the bone growth retardation in bone rudiments from mice mimicking human thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TDII). Finally, P3 reversed the neonatal lethality of TDII mice. Thus, this study identifies a novel inhibitory peptide for FGFR3 signaling, which may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia. PMID:23014564\n\nMesomelic skeletal dysplasias.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaitila, I; Leisti, J T; Rimoin, D L\n\n1976-01-01\n\nMesomelic shortening of the extremities lends itself as a useful clinical and/or radiologic sign to characterize a group of hereditary bone dysplasias. Table 1 and Figure 4 are presented to facilitate the comparison between the many different types of mesomelic dwarfism. Differential diagnosis between these types is not difficult because of the specific bone changes and extraskeletal malformations present. As in many hereditary syndromes, however, there may be wide clinical variability within a single entity, and meticulous clinical and radiologic examination must be done to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Certain other forms of chondrodystrophies, such as achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, pseudoachondroplasia and distrophic dwarfism, can be easily differentiated from the mesomelic dysplasias by their clinical features and skeletal radiographs. Nothing is known about the pathogenesis of the various forms of mesomelic dysplasias. There is no available specific treatment, although corrective surgery has benefited selected patients. The correct diagnosis is, however, important both for prognostication and accurate genetic counseling.\n\nHearing screening in children with skeletal dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nTunkel, David E; Kerbavaz, Richard; Smith, Beth; Rose-Hardison, Danielle; Alade, Yewande; Hoover-Fong, Julie\n\n2011-12-01\n\nTo determine the prevalence of hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry in children with skeletal dysplasia. Clinical screening program. National convention of the Little People of America. Convenience sample of volunteers aged 18 years or younger with skeletal dysplasias. Hearing screening with behavioral testing and/or otoacoustic emissions, otoscopy, and tympanometry. A failed hearing screen was defined as hearing 35 dB HL (hearing level) or greater at 1 or more tested frequencies or by a \"fail\" otoacoustic emissions response. Types B and C tympanograms were considered abnormal. A total of 58 children (aged â¤18 years) with skeletal dysplasia enrolled, and 56 completed hearing screening. Forty-one children had normal hearing (71%); 9 failed in 1 ear (16%); and 6 failed in both ears (10%). Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (PÂ =Â .03). Hearing loss and middle-ear disease are both highly prevalent in children with skeletal dysplasias. Abnormal tympanometry is highly associated with the presence of hearing loss, as expected in children with eustachian tube dysfunction. Hearing screening with medical intervention is recommended for these children.\n\nGrowth-sparing spinal instrumentation in skeletal dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaratas, Ali F; Dede, Ozgur; Rogers, Kenneth; Ditro, Colleen P; Holmes, Laurens; Bober, Michael; Shah, Suken A; Mackenzie, William G\n\n2013-11-15\n\nRetrospective case series. To report the outcomes of distraction-based, growth-sparing spinal instrumentation in patients with skeletal dysplasia. Patients with skeletal dysplasia with spinal deformity often undergo early fusion, further compromising an already small chest. Nonfusion techniques may provide a safe alternative and allow for thoracic growth. Between 2004 and 2010, 12 children with a diagnosis of various types of skeletal dysplasia underwent growth-sparing spinal instrumentation for severe spinal deformities. The mean duration of treatment with growing rods was 57 months (42-84 mo). Nine patients were treated with growing rods (8 dual, 1 single), and 3 were treated with vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR; Synthes). Preoperative, initial postoperative, and final follow-up anteroposterior and lateral spine radiographs were measured for magnitude of deformity, junctional kyphosis, and implant failure. The major curve Cobb angle improved from a mean of 79Â° preoperatively to a mean of 41Â° at the last follow-up (52%). There was a decrease in mean thoracic kyphosis from 77Â° preoperatively to 64Â° at final follow-up and an increase in mean lumbar lordosis from 58Â° preoperatively to 63Â° at final follow-up. The mean space available for the lungs increased by 26 mm on the concave and 24 mm on the convex side. Six patients required revision surgery for proximal junctional kyphosis. There were 4 rod failures and 6 hook and 8 screw dislodgements. One patient with vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib had failed rib fixation that required revision. Growth-sparing spinal instrumentation in patients with skeletal dysplasia and severe spinal deformity has a high complication and revision rate, and surgeons should closely monitor these patients. The complication rate is comparable with previous reports on patients with other diagnoses. However, deformities were well controlled, some trunk growth was achieved, and fusion surgery was delayed in\n\nThe Radiograph of the Pelvis as a Window to Skeletal Dysplasias.\n\nPubMed\n\nGajarajulu, Vijayalakshmi; Natarajan, Balakrishnan; Muralinath, S\n\n2016-06-01\n\nSkeletal dysplasias are disorders of bone formation. There are many dysplasias that have been identified and studied over the years and long lists of radiological features have been documented; it is not possible to remember all of them, most of which are common to more than one dysplasia. This article is about a practical approach to the radiological diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias by viewing only a few radiographs rather than the entire skeletal survey. The radiographs that are to be studied are AP view of the pelvis, dorsolumbar spine- AP and lateral view and both hands PA view, in that order. The skull lateral view and both knees AP view are sometimes required. The authors advice to set out with the pelvis that provides information of not only the pelvic bones but also parts of the lumbar spine and the upper ends of the femur including their epiphyses, metaphyses and a part of the diaphyses. Sometimes the diagnosis is reached with only this one radiograph, as in achondroplasia or it may indicate a group like mucopolysaccharidoses which can be sorted out with radiographs of the spine and hands or the upper part of the femur can provide a cue to epiphyseal and metaphyseal dysplasias. Gamuts and atlases can be consulted for the rare dysplasias.\n\nPaleopathological Study of Dwarfism-Related Skeletal Dysplasia in a Late Joseon Dynasty (South Korean) Population.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoo, Eun Jin; Lee, Won-Joon; Hu, Kyung-Seok; Hwang, Jae Joon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSkeletal dysplasias related to genetic etiologies have rarely been reported for past populations. This report presents the skeletal characteristics of an individual with dwarfism-related skeletal dysplasia from South Korea. To assess abnormal deformities, morphological features, metric data, and computed tomography scans are analyzed. Differential diagnoses include achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia, chondrodysplasia, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, thalassemia-related hemolytic anemia, and lysosomal storage disease. The diffused deformities in the upper-limb bones and several coarsened features of the craniofacial bones indicate the most likely diagnosis to have been a certain type of lysosomal storage disease. The skeletal remains of EP-III-4-No.107 from the Eunpyeong site, although incomplete and fragmented, provide important clues to the paleopathological diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias.\n\nPaleopathological Study of Dwarfism-Related Skeletal Dysplasia in a Late Joseon Dynasty (South Korean) Population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWoo, Eun Jin; Lee, Won-Joon; Hu, Kyung-Seok; Hwang, Jae Joon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSkeletal dysplasias related to genetic etiologies have rarely been reported for past populations.

This patient population has an increased risk for peri-operative complications related to the anatomy of their upper airway, abnormalities of tracheal-bronchial morphology and function; deformity of their chest wall; abnormal mobility of their upper cervical spine; and associated issues with general health and body habitus. Utilizing evidence analysis and expert opinion, this study aims to describe best practices regarding the peri-operative management of patients with skeletal dysplasia. A panel of 13 multidisciplinary international experts participated in a Delphi process that included a thorough literature review; a list of 22 possible care recommendations; two rounds of anonymous voting; and a face to face meeting. Those recommendations with more than 80% agreement were considered as consensual. Consensus was reached to support 19 recommendations for best pre-operative management of patients with skeletal dysplasia. These recommendations include pre-operative pulmonary, polysomnography; cardiac, and neurological evaluations; imaging of the cervical spine; and anesthetic management of patients with a difficult airway for intubation and extubation. The goals of this consensus based best practice guideline are to provide a minimum of standardized care, reduce perioperative complications, and improve clinical outcomes for patients with skeletal dysplasia.

Congenital skeletal deformity seriously affects body function or even leads to neonatal death directly. The disease brings great pain to victim and their family. We reviewed the fetal prenatal ultrasonic data conducted during period from Jan. 2013 to June 2016, and there were 84 fetuses with skeletal abnormalities among 12 000 cases, and 3 fetuses with thanatophoric dysplasia. Our report described and reviewed three common types of thanatophoric dysplasia, aiming to explore the value of standardized prenatal ultrasonic diagnosis of fetal abnormalities in the skeletal system.\n\nATF4 mediation of NF1 functions in osteoblast reveals a nutritional basis for congenital skeletal dysplasiae.\n\nPubMed\n\nElefteriou, Florent; Benson, M Douglas; Sowa, Hideaki; Starbuck, Michael; Liu, Xiuyun; Ron, David; Parada, Luis F; Karsenty, Gerard\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThe transcription factor ATF4 enhances bone formation by favoring amino acid import and collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, a function requiring its phosphorylation by RSK2, the kinase inactivated in Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. Here, we show that in contrast, RSK2 activity, ATF4-dependent collagen synthesis, and bone formation are increased in mice lacking neurofibromin in osteoblasts (Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice). Independently of RSK2, ATF4 phosphorylation by PKA is enhanced in Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice, thereby increasing Rankl expression, osteoclast differentiation, and bone resorption. In agreement with ATF4 function in amino acid transport, a low-protein diet decreased bone protein synthesis and normalized bone formation and bone mass in Nf1(ob)(-/-) mice without affecting other organ weight, while a high-protein diet overcame Atf4(-/-) and Rsk2(-/-) mice developmental defects, perinatal lethality, and low bone mass. By showing that ATF4-dependent skeletal dysplasiae are treatable by dietary manipulations, this study reveals a molecular connection between nutrition and skeletal development.\n\nSkeletal dysplasia with craniofacial deformity and disproportionate dwarfism in hair sheep of northeastern Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nDantas, F P M; Medeiros, G X; Figueiredo, A P M; Thompson, K; Riet-Correa, F\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper reports a newly described form of skeletal dysplasia affecting Brazilian hair sheep of the Cabugi breed. This breed is characterized by having a short head and in some cases the animals are smaller and more compact than sheep of similar breeds. Lambs born with craniofacial abnormalities and dwarfism that die at 2-6 months of age are frequent in this breed. In a flock of 68 ewes and three rams of the Cabugi breed, 134 lambs were born over a 4-year period. Of these, 14 (10.4%) had marked cranial abnormalities and dwarfism and died or were humanely destroyed, 43 (32%) had a normal face and 77 (57.5%) had the short face characteristic of the breed. Dwarf lambs were much smaller than normal, with short legs, a domed head with retruded muzzle and protruded mandible, sternal deformities and exophthalmic eyes situated more laterally in the face than normal. Microscopical examination of long bones of the limbs, bones of the base of the skull and vertebrae showed no lesions. Bones from four affected lambs and one control lamb were macerated for morphometric examination. Although the length of the spinal cord was similar, there was disproportionate shortening of the appendicular bones, particularly the distal segments. Thus the disease was defined as a skeletal dysplasia characterized by craniofacial deformity and disproportionate dwarfism. It is suggested that the disease is inherited as an incomplete dominant trait. The shortened face, which is a feature of the Cabugi breed, may represent the heterozygous state and the more severe, often lethal, dwarfism may occur in homozygotes. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Case 1 presented at birth with rhizomelic shortening of the extremities and bowing of the femora. She developed clinical signs of severe combined immunodeficiency at 13 months and died at 21 months. Case 2 had severe prenatal shortening and bowing of the extremities and a small, malformed chest. Symptoms of severe combined immunodeficiency and severe failure to thrive developed soon after birth and she died at 5 months. The diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency in our patients was based on their clinical course and necropsy findings, supported in case 1 by the results of immune function tests. The results of investigation of immune function (immunoglobulins, lymphocyte subpopulations, lymphocyte function) are very variable in this syndrome as in other variants of severe combined immunodeficiency. Bone histopathology in both patients showed grossly irregular costochondral junctions, but normal transition of proliferating to hypertrophic chondrocytes. These cases belong to early lethal type 1 short limb skeletal dysplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency. Review of previously published cases with severe combined immunodeficiency and well documented skeletal findings show eight patients with prenatal onset of bowing and shortening of the extremities and metaphyseal abnormalities. These include two sib pairs concordant for the skeletal changes. In these cases, adenosine deaminase levels were not reported. An additional four published cases with associated adenosine deaminase deficiency had only mild metaphyseal abnormalities, but subsequently showed no linear growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Images PMID:1999827\n\nEducation and related support from medical specialists for Japanese patients with major skeletal dysplasias.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaga, Nobuhiko; Kosaki, Keisuke; Takikawa, Kazuharu; Tanaka, Hiroshi; Okada, Keita; Nakahara, Yasuo; Ogata, Naoshi\n\n2013-10-01\n\nSkeletal dysplasias manifest various clinical symptoms. Age at onset, severity, and progression of symptoms differ even among individuals with the same diagnosis. Though necessary support in education is presumed to differ among patients with different disorders, few articles report on education in patients with skeletal dysplasias. To clarify what types of schools children with major skeletal dysplasias attend, what kind of support they needed at schools, and how the advice on such support was conveyed from medical specialists to schools. Questionnaire study on patients with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia (A/HCH), and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). In A/HCH childhood locomotion ability was high and most patients had received general education, irrespective of their generation. Children with OI showed a lower level of locomotion ability; only about half of them had received general education. In selecting schools, the patients received advice from pediatricians, physiatrists, and orthopedic surgeons. The degree of necessity and content of support at the schools differed between A/HCH and OI. Remodeling of the lavatory, washbasin, and chair and support during swimming lessons were common in A/HCH patients. Support in school for OI patients was more frequent and included propelling wheelchairs, assisting in the use of the bathroom, and remodeling the lavatory. Most children were restricted from participating in physical education classes. Locomotion ability and the necessary support at school differed between A/HCH and OI. Support and advice from medical specialists who recognize disability of patients with skeletal dysplasias may improve patients' participation and education in schools. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We report a male patient who showed clinical findings congruent with TD type 2 and a new mutation in the FGFR3 gene, a finding which has not been reported previously.\n\nProtein-losing enteropathy with intestinal lymphangiectasia in skeletal dysplasia with Lys650Met mutation.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Chen; Dehner, Louis P\n\n2016-11-01\n\nProtein-losing enteropathy is a primary or secondary manifestation of a group of conditions, and etiologies which are broadly divisible into those with mucosal injury on the basis of inflammatory and ulcerative conditions, mucosal injury without erosions or ulcerations, and lymphatic abnormalities. We describe the first case of protein-losing enteropathy in a pediatric patient, with severe skeletal dysplasia consistent with thanatophoric dysplasia type I and DNA analysis that revealed a c.1949A>T (p.Lys650Met) in exon 15 of the FGFR3 gene. She presented with protein-losing enteropathy in her 6th month. Post-mortem examination revealed lymphangiectasia in the small intestine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal lymphangiectasia as a complication of skeletal dysplasia resulting in severe protein-losing enteropathy. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In addition, the bones of the lower extremities tend to be more severely affected than the bones of the upper extremities. Despite the severe skeletal deformities, the condition is not lethal and surviving individuals can have normal intelligence.

Douglas; Sowa, Hideaki; Starbuck, Michael; Liu, Xiuyun; Ron, David; Parada, Luis F.; Karsenty, Gerard\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSummary The transcription factor ATF4 enhances bone formation by favoring amino acid import and collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, a function requiring its phosphorylation by RSK2, the kinase inactivated in Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. Here, we show that in contrast, RSK2 activity, ATF4-dependent collagen synthesis, and bone formation are increased in mice lacking neurofibromin in osteoblasts (Nf1obâ/â mice). Independently of RSK2, ATF4 phosphorylation by PKA is enhanced in Nf1obâ/â mice, thereby increasing Rankl expression, osteoclast differentiation, and bone resorption. In agreement with ATF4 function in amino acid transport, a low-protein diet decreased bone protein synthesis and normalized bone formation and bone mass in Nf1obâ/â mice without affecting other organ weight, while a high-protein diet overcame Atf4â/â and Rsk2â/â mice developmental defects, perinatal lethality, and low bone mass. By showing that ATF4-dependent skeletal dysplasiae are treatable by dietary manipulations, this study reveals a molecular connection between nutrition and skeletal development.

We report a case of an 11-month-old girl with an unknown short-limbed dwarfism, similar to acromicric dysplasia, with grade II subglottic stenosis. Laryngotracheoplasty with anterior autologous costal cartilage graft and posterior cricoid split was performed at age 13 months, with subsequent improvement of her airway status. In cases of children with skeletal dysplasias and obstructive airway symptoms, formal otolaryngologic evaluation is warranted for definitive diagnosis and treatment.\n\nAn Exploration of Sexual Health Education among Individuals with Skeletal Dysplasia (Dwarfism)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZamboni, Brian D.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nUsing quantitative and qualitative measures, this study examined reports of sexual health education among 300 individuals with skeletal dysplasia (dwarfism).

This study describes clinical and radiological results of a new cable technique for occipitocervical fusion (OCF) in children with skeletal dysplasia (SD). Anatomical variability and poor bone quality make upper cervical surgery technically challenging in patients with SD. We present a new cable technique for OCF in children with SD when the posterior elements are not of a size or quality for other types of instrumentation. Retrospective review of 24 patients with SD (8 boys, 16 girls) who underwent OCF between 2001 and 2011. In this technique, cables provide compression across a bone graft that is prevented from entering the canal and the graft resists excessive lordosis. Demographic and radiographical data are presented. All patients were followed for initial outcomes of surgery, and 20 patients (83%) were followed for 2 years or more for mid- and long-term outcomes. Mean age at surgery was 6.5 years and mean follow-up was 4.1 Â± 2.4 years. This technique was used as a primary procedure in 20 and a revision procedure in 4 patients. Diagnoses included Morquio syndrome (6), spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (9), spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (5), metatropic dysplasia (3), and Kniest syndrome (1). Ten patients had upper cervical instability and features of cervical myelopathy, and the remaining 14 patients had instability and signal changes on magnetic resonance image. Fusion extended from occiput to C2 in 71% patients, and upper cervical decompression was needed in 92% patients. Postoperatively, all patients were immobilized in a halo vest for mean duration of 12 weeks. Fusion was achieved in all patients. Complications included halo pin-tract infections (7), junctional instability (2), and extension of fusion (4). This new cable technique is a good alternative for OCF in patients with SD who have altered anatomy at the craniocervical junction not amenable to rigid internal fixation. 4.\n\nA case of boomerang dysplasia with a novel causative mutation in filamin B: identification of typical imaging findings on ultrasonography and 3D-CT imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsutsumi, Seiji; Maekawa, Ayako; Obata, Miyuki; Morgan, Timothy; Robertson, Stephen P; Kurachi, Hirohisa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBoomerang dysplasia is a rare lethal osteochondrodysplasia characterized by disorganized mineralization of the skeleton, leading to complete nonossification of some limb bones and vertebral elements, and a boomerang-like aspect to some of the long tubular bones. Like many short-limbed skeletal dysplasias with accompanying thoracic hypoplasia, the potential lethality of the phenotype can be difficult to ascertain prenatally. We report a case of boomerang dysplasia prenatally diagnosed by use of ultrasonography and 3D-CT imaging, and identified a novel mutation in the gene encoding the cytoskeletal protein filamin B (FLNB) postmortem. Findings that aided the radiological diagnosis of this condition in utero included absent ossification of two out of three long bones in each limb and elements of the vertebrae and a boomerang-like shape to the ulnae. The identified mutation is the third described for this disorder and is predicted to lead to amino acid substitution in the actin-binding domain of the filamin B molecule. Copyright Â© 2012 S.

The proportionate shortening of tubular bones of about 50 per cent of the normal length, the absence of thoracic dysplasia, and a normal head circumference narrowed the diagnosis down to a severe but non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. Ulnar deviation of the hands and talipes made diastrophic dysplasia the most likely differential diagnosis. At post-mortem clinical examination, the diagnosis of diastrophic dysplasia was clearly apparent due to highly specific 'hitch-hiker thumbs', similarly luxated big toes, facial dysmorphism, and a cleft palate. Retrospective re-evaluation of the prenatal ultrasound videos revealed the misplaced thumbs, which together with the ulnar deviation of the wrist and suspected talipes, led to the conclusion that the definitive diagnosis can be established prenatally, even in a mother with massive obesity.\n\nMicrocephaly, ectodermal dysplasia, multiple skeletal anomalies and distinctive facial appearance: delineation of cerebro-dermato-osseous-dysplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastori, Marco; Pascolini, Giulia; Parisi, Valentina; Sana, Maria Elena; Novelli, Antonio; NÃ¼rnberg, Peter; Iascone, Maria; Grammatico, Paola\n\n2015-04-01\n\nIn 1980, a novel multiple malformation syndrome has been described in a 17-year-old woman with micro- and turricephaly, intellectual disability, distinctive facial appearance, congenital atrichia, and multiple skeletal anomalies mainly affecting the limbs. Four further sporadic patients and a couple of affected sibs are also reported with a broad clinical variability. Here, we describe a 4-year-old girl strikingly resembling the original report. Phenotype comparison identified a recurrent pattern of multisystem features involving the central nervous system, and skin and bones in five sporadic patients (including ours), while the two sibs and a further sporadic case show significant phenotypic divergence. Marked clinical variability within the same entity versus syndrome splitting is discussed and the term \"cerebro-dermato-osseous dysplasia\" is introduced to define this condition.

Pelvic radiographs from 95 participants (56 females) in a follow-up hip study of 18- to 19-year-old patients were included. Eleven radiological measurements relevant for hip dysplasia (Sharp's, Wiberg's, and Ogata's angles; acetabular roof angle of TÃ¶nnis; articulo-trochanteric distance; acetabular depth-width ratio; femoral head extrusion index; maximum teardrop width; and the joint space width in three different locations) were validated. Three observers measured the radiographs using both a digital measurement program and manually in AgfaWeb1000. Inter-method and inter- and intra-observer agreement were analyzed using the mean differences between the readings/readers, establishing the 95% limits of agreement. We also calculated the minimum detectable change and the intra-class correlation coefficient. Large variations among different radiological measurements were demonstrated. However, the variation was not related to the use of either the manual or digital measurement technique. For measurements with greater absolute values (Sharp's angle, femoral head extrusion index, and acetabular depth-width ratio) the inter- and intra-observer and inter-method agreements were better as compared to measurements with lower absolute values (acetabular roof angle, teardrop and joint space width). The inter- and intra-observer variation differs notably across different radiological measurements relevant for hip dysplasia at skeletal maturity, a fact that should be taken into account in clinical practice. The agreement between the manual and digital methods is good.\n\nCranioplasty Using a Modified Split Calvarial Graft Technique in Cleidocranial Dysplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJung, Young Taek; Cho, Jae Ik\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCleidocranial dysplasia is a well-documented rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by hypoplastic/aplastic clavicles, brachycephalic skull, patent sutures and fontanelles, midface hypoplasia, and abnormalities of dentition. Patients with cleidocranial dysplasia often complain about undesirable esthetic appearance of their forehead and skull. Notwithstanding many studies of molecular, genetics and skeletal abnormalities of this congenial disorder, there have been very few written reports of cranioplasty involving cleidocranial dysplasia. Thus, we report a rare case of successful cranioplasty using a modified split calvarial graft technique in patient with cleidocranial dysplasia.

In this study of children with skeletal dysplasia and upper cervical instability, we compared fusion rates and complications between (1) patients treated with no instrumentation or with wiring techniques and (2) those who underwent rigid cervical spine instrumentation. We also sought to characterize the presentation and common parameters of upper cervical instability in this population. A multicenter study identified twenty-eight children with skeletal dysplasia who underwent surgery from 2000 through 2011 for C1-C2 instability and were followed for a minimum of two years. Fourteen children were treated with no instrumentation or with instrumentation with wires or cables (nonrigid-fixation group) and fourteen were treated with screws (or hooks) and rods (rigid-fixation group). All patients received autograft, and twenty (twelve in the nonrigid group and eight in the rigid group) were treated with a halo-body jacket. Fourteen children had C1-C2 fusion, and fourteen had occipitocervical fusion. Eleven (39%) underwent spinal cord decompression. The nonunion rate was significantly higher in the nonrigid-fixation group (six of fourteen) than in the rigid-fixation group (zero of fourteen; p = 0.0057). Complications, including nonunion, occurred in nine patients in the nonrigid group and one patient in the rigid group. However, two of the complications in the nonrigid-fixation group were vertebral artery bleeding episodes that actually occurred during an attempt at rigid fixation (the fixation was subsequently done with wiring). No new neurologic deficits were observed. Five of the seven children with a preoperative neurologic deficit showed at least partial recovery, with significant improvement in the Japanese Orthopaedic Association upper-extremity score (p = 0.047).

A large number of mutations has been found in the COL2A1 gene. Glycine substitutions have been the most common types of mutation. Genotype-phenotype correlations in type II collagenopathies have not been established, partly because of insufficient clinical and radiographic description of the patients. We found a glycine-to-arginine substitution at position 154 in type II collagen in two unrelated isolated propositi with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia and provide a comparative clinical and radiographic analysis from birth to young adulthood for this condition. The clinical phenotype was disproportionate short stature withmoreÂ Â» varus/valgus deformities of the lower limbs requiring corrective osteotomies, and lumbar lordosis.

The diagnosis of short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS) was feasible by ultrasound during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. SRPS represents a heterogeneous group of lethal skeletal dysplasias. It is characterised by short limb dwarfism complicated by thoracic hypoplasia, polydactyly and different anomalies of major organs such as congenital heart defects and renal dysplasia. Four major types of the SRPS have been described: type I (Saldino-Noonan); type II (Majewski); type III (Verma-Naumoff) and type IV (Beemar-Langer). However, there is phenotypic overlapping between four types and with those of non-lethal skeletal dysplasias (i.e. Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and Jeune syndrome). Our cases show the importance of the nuchal translucency (NT) scan that offers the opportunity to examine fetal anatomy in the 1st trimester and diagnose rare skeletal abnormalities early in pregnancy.\n\nRecurrent SOX9 deletion campomelic dysplasia due to somatic mosaicism in the father.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmyk, M; Obersztyn, E; Nowakowska, B; Bocian, E; Cheung, S W; Mazurczak, T; Stankiewicz, P\n\n2007-04-15\n\nHaploinsufficiency of SOX9, a master gene in chondrogenesis and testis development, leads to the semi-lethal skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia (CD), with or without XY sex reversal. We report on two children with CD and a phenotypically normal father, a carrier of a somatic mosaic SOX9 deletion. This is the first report of a mosaic deletion of SOX9; few familial CD cases with germline and somatic mutation mosaicism have been described. Our findings confirm the utility of aCGH and indicate that for a more accurate estimate of the recurrence risk for a completely penetrant autosomal dominant disorder, parental somatic mosaicism should be considered in healthy parents.

Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering could be the next areas to benefit from refinement of iPSC methods to repair focal cartilage defects, while applications for osteoarthritis (OA) and drug screening have evolved rather slowly. Although the advances in iPSC research of skeletal dysplasias and repair of focal cartilage lesions are not directly relevant to OA, they can be considered to pave the way to future prospects and solutions to OA research, too. The same problems which face the present cell-based treatments of cartilage injuries concern also the iPSC-based ones. However, established iPSC lines, which have no genomic aberrations and which efficiently differentiate into extracellular matrix secreting chondrocytes, could be an invaluable cell source for cell transplantations in the future. The safety issues concerning the recipient risks of teratoma formation and immune response still have to be solved before the potential use of iPSCs in cartilage repair of focal cartilage defects and OA.

The diaphyseal length and the bowed shape of long bones associated with vertebral body dimension assessment were investigated in a group of 14 pregnancy terminations carried out in the time period 2007-2013. The definitive diagnosis was established after pregnancy termination by means of skeletal standardized X-rays, histopathology and gene analysis. TD and OI-2 long bones were significantly shorter than controls. No significant differences were observed between the two dysplasias. The bowing angle was higher in OI-2; a true angulation or eventually axial displacement was present only in the latter. Furthermore, they did not show any evidence of vertebral collapse. The thanatophoric dysplasia presented less bowed long bones, and never true angulation. The spine was steadily characterized by flattened anterior vertebral bodies. Long bone shortening is not a sufficient and accurate sign for early sonographic differential diagnosis between TD and OI-2. Angled diaphysis, axial diaphyseal displacement and a conserved vertebral body height in the prenatal period support the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type 2, while moderately regular bowed diaphysis associated with platyspondyly that of thanatophoric dysplasia.\n\nA recurrent mutation causing Melnick-Needles syndrome in females confers a severe, lethal phenotype in males.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpencer, Careni; Lombaard, Hendrik; Wise, Amy; Krause, Amanda; Robertson, Stephen P\n\n2018-04-01\n\nMelnick-Needles syndrome (MNS; MIM 309350) is an X-linked skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in FLNA. Females with the condition present with characteristic facial features, short stature, skeletal anomalies, including poorly modeled and sclerotic bones, and structural abnormalities such as cardiac and urological defects. Previously males were thought to present with either a mild phenotype compatible with life or a severe lethal presentation depending on the maternal phenotype. The discovery of a limited number of mutations in FLNA as the cause of the condition has clarified the molecular basis of the disorder, but only a very small number of severely affected males have been reported with MNS. Furthermore, no mildly affected males have been described with a molecular confirmation of the condition. In this report, we describe the clinical and molecular findings of a mildly affected mother with MNS and her severely affected son. They shared a well-documented disease-causing variant in FLNA, p.(Ala1188Thr), one of two highly recurrent mutations leading to the disorder. This is only the fourth report of a male with perinatal lethal MNS and a molecular confirmation; it is the first description of this specific mutation in a male.

Duncan; Boyde, Alan; Zikmund, Tomas; Evans, Holly; Croucher, Peter I.; Zhu, Xuguang; Park, Jeong Won\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA new genetic disorder has been identified that results from mutation of THRA, encoding thyroid hormone receptor Î±1 (TRÎ±1). Affected children have a high serum T3:T4 ratio and variable degrees of intellectual deficit and constipation but exhibit a consistently severe skeletal dysplasia. In an attempt to improve developmental delay and alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism, patients are receiving varying doses and durations of T4 treatment, but responses have been inconsistent so far. Thra1PV/+ mice express a similar potent dominant-negative mutant TRÎ±1 to affected individuals, and thus represent an excellent disease model. We hypothesized that Thra1PV/+ mice could be used to predict the skeletal outcome of human THRA mutations and determine whether prolonged treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 ameliorates the skeletal abnormalities. Adult female Thra1PV/+ mice had short stature, grossly abnormal bone morphology but normal bone strength despite high bone mass. Although T4 treatment suppressed TSH secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, thus demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. Despite this, prolonged T4 treatment abnormally increased bone stiffness and strength, suggesting the potential for detrimental consequences in the long term. Our studies establish that TRÎ±1 has an essential role in the developing and adult skeleton and predict that patients with different THRA mutations will display variable responses to T4 treatment, which depend on the severity of the causative mutation.

They presented hypodontia (mean number of missing teeth, 9.5; range, 5-14), especially in the premolar region, and enamel dysplasia. Five subjects had bilateral molar occlusion, whereas one subject had unilateral molar occlusion. The common skeletal features were small facial height, maxillary hypoplasia, counterclockwise rotation of the mandible, and mandibular protrusion. Interestingly, the maxillary first molars were located in higher positions and the upper anterior facial height was smaller than the Japanese norm. The results suggest that vertical and anteroposterior maxillary growth retardation, rather than lack of occlusal support due to hypodontia, leads to reduced anterior facial height in individuals with ectodermal dysplasia.

The risk allele was on the same chromosome as the Q allele that increases carcass weight. Phenotypic characterization revealed that the risk allele causes disproportional tall stature and bone size that increases carcass weight in heterozygous individuals but causes disproportionately narrow chest width in homozygotes. A non-synonymous variant of FGD3 was identified as a positional candidate quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) and the corresponding mutant protein showed reduced activity as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42. FGD3 is expressed in the growth plate cartilage of femurs from bovine and mouse. Thus, loss of FDG3 activity may lead to subsequent loss of Cdc42 function. This would be consistent with the columnar disorganization of proliferating chondrocytes in chondrocyte-specific inactivated Cdc42 mutant mice. This is the first report showing association of FGD3 with skeletal dysplasia.

In this study we evaluate quality of life in patients with fibrous dysplasia using the Short Form-36 and the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaires. Data were compared with those of the general Dutch population. Out of 138 patients from a cohort of 255 patients with fibrous dysplasia that were sent questionnaires assessing quality of life and pain, the response rate was 70.3%, with 97 patients, predominantly female (65%), completing the questionnaires. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia was predominant (nâ=â62, 64%). Fibrous dysplasia patients had significantly lower quality of life outcome scores than the general Dutch population for all tested domains of the Short Form-36 except for the \"Mental health\" and the \"Role emotional\" domains. More severe forms of fibrous dysplasia, had the more severe Short-Form-36 quality of life outcomes, but there was no significant difference in Brief Pain Inventory domains between different subtypes of fibrous dysplasia. Quality of life was lower in patients with higher disease burden, as reflected by high skeletal burden scores (pâ=â0.003) and high levels of P1NP (pâ=â0.002). We demonstrate impairments in all domains of quality of life, except for 'Mental health' and 'Role emotional' domains, across the wide spectrum of fibrous dysplasia including its milder forms. We identified high skeletal burden scores, reflecting disease severity, as the most consistent predictor of impaired quality of life. Our findings hold significant clinical implications as they draw attention to the clinically unmet need to address quality of life issues in the management of patients with all subtypes of fibrous dysplasia, including its milder forms.\n\nAnesthetic management during a cesarean section in a patient with cleidocranial dysplasia: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nNishio, Yumiko; Hiraki, Teruyuki; Taniguchi, Hiroko; Ushijima, Kazuo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCleidocranial dysplasia is a type of skeletal dysplasia, which is primarily characterized by delayed ossification of skeletal structures. It causes facial and oral abnormalities, resulting in difficult airway management and neuraxial anesthesia. The patient was a 24-year-old primipara (height 138Â cm, weight 42Â kg) with a hypoplastic right clavicle, patent fontanelles, dental malalignment, and a high palate. She was diagnosed with cleidocranial dysplasia at birth, although gene examination has not been performed. The fetus was confirmed to have short limbs and large fontanelles during an examination performed at 28Â weeks gestation, suspected to have cleidocranial dysplasia. The mother was scheduled for a cesarean section at 37Â weeks and 1Â day due to cephalopelvic disproportion. Preoperative radiography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no vertebral and spinal abnormalities, which allowed combined spinal-epidural analgesia (CSEA) to be performed. The surgery was safely concluded under CSEA with no intraoperative respiratory or circulatory problems. Patients with cleidocranial dysplasia exhibit facial, oral abnormalities, and often vertebral abnormalities. Imaging assessments before neuraxial anesthesia and careful preparation for airway management are required.\n\nClinical and molecular characterization of Diastrophic Dysplasia in the Portuguese population.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarbosa, M; Sousa, A B; Medeira, A; LourenÃ§o, T; Saraiva, J; Pinto-Basto, J; Soares, G; Fortuna, A M; Superti-Furga, A; Mittaz, L; Reis-Lima, M; BonafÃ©, L\n\n2011-12-01\n\nSLC26A2-related dysplasias encompass a spectrum of diseases: from lethal achondrogenesis type 1B (ACG1B; MIM #600972) and atelosteogenesis type 2 (AO2; MIM #256050) to classical diastrophic dysplasia (cDTD; MIM #222600) and recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (rMED; MIM #226900). This study aimed at characterizing clinically, radiologically and molecularly 14 patients affected by non-lethal SLC26A2-related dysplasias and at evaluating genotype-phenotype correlation. Phenotypically, eight patients were classified as cDTD, four patients as rMED and two patients had an intermediate phenotype (mild DTD - mDTD, previously 'DTD variant'). The Arg279Trp mutation was present in all patients, either in homozygosity (resulting in rMED) or in compound heterozygosity with the known severe alleles Arg178Ter or Asn425Asp (resulting in DTD) or with the mutation c.727-1G>C (causing mDTD). The 'Finnish mutation', c.-26+2T>C, and the p.Cys653Ser, both frequent mutations in non-Portuguese populations, were not identified in any of the patients of our cohort and are probably very rare in the Portuguese population. A targeted mutation analysis for p.Arg279Trp and p.Arg178Ter in the Portuguese population allows the identification of approximately 90% of the pathogenic alleles.

CCD is caused by mutations, deletions or duplications in runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), which encodes for a protein essential for osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation. We describe three familial cases of CCD, misdiagnosed as rickets over three generations. No mutations were detected on standard DNA sequencing of RUNX2, but a novel deletion was identified on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The present cases indicate that CCD could be misdiagnosed as rickets, leading to inappropriate treatment, and confirm that mutations in RUNX2 are not able to be identified on standard DNA sequencing in all CCD patients, but can be identified on qPCR and MLPA.

We studied two sisters who were unusual because of severe intrauterine growth restriction, absence of growth after birth, decrease of pre- and postnatal spontaneous mobility, and early fatal outcome. The chondro-osseous morphology documented a distinctive osteochondrodysplasia. The radiographic examination was superficially similar to gracile bone dysplasias but was inconsistent with any known types of this group. These two patients appear to have a unique gracile bone dysplasia.

Their skeletal phenotype overlaps with the SHOX-related skeletal dysplasias and is intermediate between Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) and Langer Mesomelic dysplasia (LMD). The mother has bilateral Peters anomaly of the eye and was reported as having a new syndrome; the son had severe bilateral sclerocornea. Chromosome analysis showed that the mother has a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome [46,X,inv(X)(p22.3q27)] and the son, a resultant recombinant X chromosome [46,Y,rec(X)dup(Xq)inv(X)(p22.3q27)]. The observed skeletal and ophthalmologic abnormalities in both patients were similar in severity. The additional features of developmental delay, growth retardation, agenesis of the corpus callosum, cryptorchidism and hypoplastic scrotum in the son are consistent with Xq28 duplication. Analysis of the son's recombinant X chromosome showed that the Xp22.33 breakpoint lies 30-68 kb 5' of the SHOX gene. This finding suggests that the skeletal dysplasia in both mother and son is allelic with LWD and LMD and results from a novel misexpression of SHOX. Analysis of the Xq27.1 breakpoint localized it to a 90 kb interval 3' of the SOX3 gene, supporting a novel role of SOX3 misexpression in the development of Peters anomaly of the eye.

Three distinct forms of platyspondylic lethal neonatal short-limbed dwarfism could be distinguished: (1) Thanatophoric type, (2) Torrance type, and (3) San Diego type. The latter two disorders had similar radiographic abnormalities that were clearly different from those of typical thanatophoric dysplasia. All three disorders had clearly different condroosseous histopathologic abnormalities. Preliminary biochemical studies have revealed different electrophorectic abnormalities in solubilized type II collagen chains of cartilage in each of these three disorders.\n\nEarly severe scoliosis in a patient with atypical progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD): Identification of two WISP3 mutations, one previously unreported.\n\nPubMed\n\nMontanÃ©, Lucia Sentchordi; MarÃ­n, Oliver R; Rivera-Pedroza, Carlos I; VallespÃ­n, Elena; Del Pozo, Ãngela; Heath, Karen E\n\n2016-06-01\n\nProgressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia associated with pain and stiffness of multiple joints, enlargement of the interphalangeal joints, normal inflammatory parameters, and absence of extra-skeletal manifestations. Homozygous or compound heterozygous WISP3 mutations cause PPD. We report two siblings from a non-consanguineous Ecuadorian family with a late-onset spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Mutation screening was undertaken in the two affected siblings using a customized skeletal dysplasia next generation sequencing (NGS) panel and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Two compound heterozygous mutations were identified in WISP3 exon 2, c.[190G>A];[197G>A] (p.[(Gly64Arg)];[(Ser66Asn)]) in the two siblings, both of which had been inherited. The p. (Gly64Arg) mutation has not been previously described whilst the p. (Ser66Asn) mutation has been reported in two PPD families. The two siblings presented with atypical PPD, as they presented during late childhood, yet the severity was different between them. The progression was particularly aggressive in the male sibling who suffered severe scoliosis by the age of 13 years. This case reaffirms the clinical heterogeneity of this disorder and the clinical utility of NGS to genetically diagnose skeletal dysplasias, enabling adequate management, monitorization, and genetic counseling.

The diagnosis is often made just after birth or exitus. The prenatal diagnosis of osteochondrodysplasias is based predominantly upon fetal ultrasound findings and it focuses substantially on the possible lethality of the disorder, without always being able to find a specific name for the disorder. Metatropic dysplasia is a rare osteochondrodysplasia due to mutations in the TRPV4 gene: TRPV4 is a cation channel, non-selectively permeable to calcium, encoded by a gene on chromosome 12q24.11; it is widely expressed and involved in many different physiological processes through responses to several different stimuli (physical, chemical, and hormonal) in ciliated epithelial cells. The exact incidence of this disorder is not known, however less than a hundred cases have been reported at present, with only two prenatal reports but without any reference to the molecular test. We describe the first report of molecular diagnosis of metatropic dysplasia carried out in prenatal diagnosis: the molecular testing of the TRPV4 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4, MIM *605427) gene in our case, in fact, detected a causative variant, confirming the diagnostic suspicion, which was made possible thanks also to the utilization of MRI and CT scan. In our case different imaging methods together with the close cooperation of a multidisciplinary team and test availability, allowed an accurate diagnosis. Copyright Â© 2017.

Records from 56 individuals were reviewed and demonstrated fractures, scoliosis, and non-congenital hypophosphatemia that in some cases were resolved. Phosphate and calcitriol, but not skin lesion removal, were effective at controlling hypophosphatemia. No skeletal malignancies were found. CSHS is a disorder defined by the association of epidermal and/or melanocytic nevi, a mosaic skeletal dysplasia, and an FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia. To date, somatic RAS mutations have been identified in all patients whose affected tissue has undergone DNA sequencing. However, the clinical spectrum and treatment are poorly defined in CSHS. The purpose of this study is to determine the spectrum of the phenotype, natural history of the disease, and response to treatment of hypophosphatemia. Five CSHS subjects underwent prospective data collection at clinical research centers. A review of the literature identified 45 reports that included a total of 51 additional patients, in whom the findings were compatible with CSHS. Data on nevi subtypes, bone histology, mineral and skeletal disorders, abnormalities in other tissues, and response to treatment of hypophosphatemia were analyzed. Fractures, limb deformities, and scoliosis affected most CSHS subjects. Hypophosphatemia was not present at birth. Histology revealed severe osteomalacia but no other abnormalities. Skeletal dysplasia was reported in all anatomical compartments, though less frequently in the spine; there was no clear correlation between the location of nevi and the skeletal lesions. Phosphate and calcitriol supplementation was the most effective therapy for rickets. Convincing data that nevi removal improved blood phosphate levels was lacking. An age-dependent improvement in mineral abnormalities was observed.

Mutations in the gene encoding human matrilin-3 (MATN-3) lead to autosomal dominant skeletal disorders, such as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), which is characterized by short stature and early-onset osteoarthritis, and bilateral hereditary microepiphyseal dysplasia, a variant form of MED characterized by pain in the hip and knee joints. To assess the function of matrilin-3 during skeletal development, we have generated Matn-3 null mice. Homozygous mutant mice appear normal, are fertile, and show no obvious skeletal malformations. Histological and ultrastructural analyses reveal endochondral bone formation indistinguishable from that of wild-type animals. Northern blot, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses indicated no compensatory upregulation of any other member of the matrilin family. Altogether, our findings suggest functional redundancy among matrilins and demonstrate that the phenotypes of MED disorders are not caused by the absence of matrilin-3 in cartilage ECM.

FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 are crucial for both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Mutations in the genes encoding FGFRs, types 1-3, are responsible for various skeletal dysplasias and craniosynostosis syndromes. Many of these disorders are relatively common in the pediatric population, and diagnosis is often challenging. These skeletal disorders can be classified based on which FGFR is affected. Skeletal disorders caused by type 1 mutations include Pfeiffer syndrome (PS) and osteoglophonic dysplasia, and disorders caused by type 2 mutations include Crouzon syndrome (CS), Apert syndrome (AS), and PS. Disorders caused by type 3 mutations include achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia (TD), severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans, Crouzonodermoskeletal syndrome, and Muenke syndrome. Most of these mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and are gain-of-function-type mutations. Imaging plays a key role in the evaluation of these skeletal disorders. Knowledge of the characteristic imaging and clinical findings can help confirm the correct diagnosis and guide the appropriate molecular genetic tests. Some characteristics and clinical findings include premature fusion of cranial sutures and deviated broad thumbs and toes in PS; premature fusion of cranial sutures and syndactyly of the hands and feet in AS; craniosynostosis, ocular proptosis, and absence of hand and foot abnormalities in CS; rhizomelic limb shortening, caudal narrowing of the lumbar interpediculate distance, small and square iliac wings, and trident hands in achondroplasia; and micromelia, bowing of the femora, and platyspondyly in TD.

PSACH is characterized by generalized epi-metaphyseal dysplasia, short-limbed dwarfism, joint laxity and early onset osteoarthritis. MED is a milder disease with radiographic features often restricted to the epiphyses of the long bones. PSACH and some forms of MED result from mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a pentameric glycoprotein found in cartilage, tendon, ligament and muscle. PSACH-MED patients often have a mild myopathy characterized by mildly increased plasma creatine kinase levels, a variation in myofibre size and/or small atrophic fibres. In some instances, patients are referred to neuromuscular clinics prior to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia; however, the myopathy associated with PSACH-MED has not previously been studied. In this study, we present a detailed study of skeletal muscle, tendon and ligament from a mouse model of mild PSACH harbouring a COMP mutation. Mutant mice exhibited a progressive muscle weakness associated with an increased number of muscle fibres with central nuclei at the perimysium and at the myotendinous junction. Furthermore, the distribution of collagen fibril diameters in the mutant tendons and ligaments was altered towards thicker collagen fibrils, and the tendons became more lax in cyclic strain tests. We hypothesize that the myopathy in PSACH-MED originates from an underlying tendon and ligament pathology that is a direct result of structural abnormalities to the collagen fibril architecture. This is the first comprehensive characterization of the musculoskeletal phenotype of PSACH-MED and is directly relevant to the clinical management of these patients.

In addition to previously published features, multiple fractures of the long bones, severe neonatal cholestasis, and histological dysplasia of the kidneys were found. The boy died at the age of 8 months. The new finding of focal renal medullary dysplasia further supports the hypothesis of a basic defect in tissue differentiation in the pathogenesis of this rare condition.

The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which TRPV4 channelopathy mutations cause skeletal dysplasia. The human TRPV4V620I channelopathy mutation was transfected into primary porcine chondrocytes and caused significant (2.6-fold) up-regulation of follistatin (FST) expression levels. Pore altering mutations that prevent calcium influx through the channel prevented significant FST up-regulation (1.1-fold). We generated a mouse model of theTRPV4V620I mutation, and found significant skeletal deformities (e.g., shortening of tibiae and digits, similar to the human disease brachyolmia) and increases in Fst/TRPV4 mRNA levels (2.8-fold). FST was significantly up-regulated in primary chondrocytes transfected with 3 different dysplasia-causing TRPV4 mutations (2- to 2.3-fold), but was not affected by an arthropathy mutation (1.1-fold). Furthermore, FST-loaded microbeads decreased bone ossification in developing chick femora (6%) and tibiae (11%). FST gene and protein levels were also increased 4-fold in human chondrocytes from an individual natively expressing the TRPV4T89I mutation. Taken together, these data strongly support that up-regulation of FST in chondrocytes by skeletal dysplasia-inducing TRPV4 mutations contributes to disease pathogenesis.âLeddy, H. A., McNulty, A.

NOMID mice in which NLRP3 is activated globally exhibit several characteristics of the human disease, including systemic inflammation and cartilage dysplasia, but the mechanisms of skeletal manifestations remain unknown. In this study, we find that activation of NLRP3 in myeloid cells, but not mesenchymal cells triggers chronic inflammation, which ultimately, causes growth plate and epiphyseal dysplasia in mice. These responses are IL-1 signaling-dependent, but independent of PARP1, which also functions downstream of NLRP3 and regulates skeletal homeostasis. Mechanistically, inflammation causes severe anemia and hypoxia in the bone environment, yet down-regulates the HIF-1Î± pathway in chondrocytes, thereby promoting the demise of these cells. Thus, activation of NLRP3 in hematopoietic cells initiates IL-1Î²-driven paracrine cascades, which promote abnormal growth plate development in NOMID mice.\n\nTorrance type of lethal neonatal short-limbed platyspondylic dwarfism.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaibara, N; Yokoyama, K; Nakano, H\n\n1983-01-01\n\nA rare case of lethal neonatal short-limbed platyspondylic dwarfism is described.

Christine; Sulikowski, James A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nElasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates, and rays) are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic threats, making a thorough understanding of their life history characteristics essential for proper management. Historically, elasmobranch reproductive data have been collected by lethal sampling, an approach that is problematic for threatened and endangered species. However, recent studies have demonstrated that non-lethal approaches can be as effective as lethal ones for assessment of the reproductive status of an animal. For example, plasma has been used to examine concentrations of steroid hormones. Additionally, skeletal muscle tissue, which can be obtained non-lethally and with minimal stress, can also be used to quantify concentrations of steroid hormones. Skeletal muscle progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations were determined to be statistically significant indicators of reproductive status in the oviparous Leucoraja erinacea, the yolk-dependent viviparous Squalus acanthias, and the yolk-sac placental viviparous Rhizoprionodon terraenovae. The results of the present study demonstrate that steroid hormones present in non-lethally harvested skeletal muscle tissue can be used as reliable indicators of reproductive status in elasmobranchs.

The oral manifestations often include the congenital absence of teeth and malformed teeth. This clinical report describes the interdisciplinary care from childhood through the definitive dental rehabilitation completed at skeletal maturation to replace the missing teeth in a patient with ectodermal dysplasia. Treatment began at 9 years of age with an implant-assisted mandibular overdenture to improve function and replace the missing mandibular teeth. Orthodontic treatment for the consolidation of space, composite resin restorations, and interim removable dental prostheses were provided to improve esthetics and replace the missing maxillary teeth. Skeletal growth was monitored, and orthognathic surgery was performed at the cessation of growth. The definitive rehabilitation consisted of a mandibular fixed dental prosthesis supported by dental implants and a maxillary removable dental prosthesis to restore the patient to esthetics and function.
