        "text": "Earthen mortars from Cremona are a mixture of soil and/or sand and lime. Three types of earthen mortars have been identified. Between the XVII and the XVIII centuries a technology change took place. Organic and inorganic additives were used to improve the performances of earthen mortars. a b s t r a c t Earthen architectures were widespread in the town of Cremona (Northern Italy) until the first decades of the XX century. An archaeometric study of earthen mortars from buildings of different ages in Cremona allowed investigating the evolution throughout centuries of a well-established masonry tradition. Three typologies of earthen mortars were identified, differing in the amount of added lime. A two-step change in the technology of earthen mortars manufacturing has been inferred. Since the XVII century, lime was added in larger amounts to the mixtures. During the XVIII–XIX centuries, organic additives were employed to further improve the performances of the earthen mortars.\n\nStarting from the Middle Age and until the second half of the XIX century, many buildings in Cremona are characterized by the almost exclusive use of earthen mortars coupled with regular clay bricks. During the survey campaign on Palazzo Raimondi in Cremona, featuring a renowned Renaissance façade dating back to the late XV century, some mechanical in situ tests have been made on the walls of the basement and of ground floor in order to investigate the mechanical behavior of this earthen-mortar masonry and to compare it with regular lime-mortar brick walls. The results of those tests are here presented, together with the interpretation of the masonry behavior during the test by means of an optical recording technique that allows following step by step the absolute displacements of multiple selected points on the specimen.\n\nThis is an English translation of the original work \"Hauser in Pompeji (Volume 1): Casa del Principe di Napoli\" edited by Volker Michael Strocka and published by the German Archaeological Institute in 1984 in German. The copyright is held by editor Strocka and Mary Harrsch received permission from Professor Strocka to prepare the translation and share it publicly. In addition, new Creative Commons-licensed images and a glossary have been added which were not in the original work. The original work is a comprehensive survey of the archaeological remains of the House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii (VI 15, 7.8) including analysis of the construction, the Fourth Style paintings, the finds, a comparative analysis of the iconography with similar works elsewhere in Pompeii, and theories surrounding the occupants."
